        "content": "For Eddy Zillan\u2019s bar mitzvah in 2012, his parents gave him $5,000 to start an investment fund. They expected him to start dabbling in stocks. Instead, he began buying cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.\n\nEddy saved up another $7,000 from summers spent working at a tennis club and other jobs, adding that to his investment fund for a total $12,000 in principal.\n\nAnybody who has been following cryptocurrencies knows where this story is going: Eddy\u2019s $12,000 investment is now worth well over $500,000, a return exceeding 4,100% in just a few years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a prodigy, but he\u2019s close,\u201d says Eddy\u2019s father, Gary Zillan. Eddy, now 18, is a high school senior in Orange, Ohio, near Cleveland. He hopes to study dentistry next year at Case Western Reserve University. But if that doesn\u2019t work out, he has a Plan B, since he just launched a company that provides tutorials and insights on cryptocurrencies. \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll be a multimillionaire by the time he\u2019s my age,\u201d says his father, who is 46.\n\nEddy Zillan, 18, of Orange, Ohio, has amassed well over $500,000 worth of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. (Photo courtesy of Eddy Zillan)\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are suddenly the hottest investment since the dot-com bubble, after a stunning surge in value during the last year.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, has soared by more than 700% in 2017. Ethereum is up a mind-boggling 3,900% \u2014 and early purchasers are suddenly watching the zeroes multiply on their accounts. Many crypto investors are reluctant to talk about their holdings, since alt-currencies are still associated with illicit activity, and they tend to appeal to non-traditionalists in the first place. But we found some willing to tell us their experiences. There are also plenty of detractors who insist cryptocurrencies are Ponzi schemes or worse. Yet regulators may soon bestow validity on cryptocurrencies by allowing broader investments, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), to track their value.\n\nThe origins of bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a digital payment system launched in 2009 by a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. A network of coders with powerful computers has slowly \u201cmined\u201d more bitcoin since then by running complex computations that adhere to a set of founding principles, making bitcoin a kind of crowd-sourced currency. The market value of all bitcoin in the world is around $132 billion at current prices, roughly comparable to the current value of McDonald\u2019s (MCD).\n\nStory continues\n\nOther cryptocurrencies, sometimes referred to as \u201caltcoins,\u201d have emerged as well, including ether, the token of the blockchain network ethereum ($32 billion in market cap), ripple ($9 billion), litecoin ($3.7 billion) and dash ($3.3 billion).\n\nIn a recent Yahoo Finance survey, 77% of respondents told us they have never purchased bitcoin \u2014 but of those, 11% said they\u2019re planning to, and 38% said they\u2019re thinking about it. As more people buy in, that interest alone could send the crypto rally even higher.\n\n[See the full results of our bitcoin survey, conducted online Nov. 10-13.]\n\nOrdinary people can buy cryptocurrencies through services like Coinbase, SpectroCoin or Kraken, usually by linking a bank account or credit card and following simple instructions. (Disclosure: I own a small amount of bitcoin.)\n\nOf 1,011 poll respondents saying they\u2019ve purchased Bitcoin, 71% have made money. Source: Yahoo Finance survey conducted via SurveyMonkey\n\nCritics such as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and hedge-fund titan Ray Dalio see cryptocurrencies as a craze that will eventually implode, akin to tulips or Enron. But Bill Gates, Richard Branson, and Mark Cuban are believers, and many investors think bitcoin and other digital currencies are like the Internet in 1995 \u2014 a transformative technology about to erupt.\n\nThe money is certainly real.\n\nBitcoin as currency\n\nPeter Saddington of Atlanta first read about bitcoin in 2011, and bought some for less than $3 per coin. With bitcoin now trading at around $7,500, the return on those early investments is around 250,000%. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d says Saddington, 35, an entrepreneur who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and three master\u2019s degrees. \u201cWhat solidified my confidence that this is worth investing in is that the code is based on math. It can\u2019t really be turned off.\u201d\n\n[Had a wild experience with cryptocurrencies? Let us know! Email us at rickjnewman@yahoo.com.]\n\nIn October, Saddington cashed out 45 bitcoins to buy a 2015 Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n, for the equivalent of about $238,000. He and the seller made the transaction in bitcoin, without using a traditional bank. The transaction fees totaled $7.50.\n\nSaddington, who runs a cryptocurrency social network called TheBitcoin.pub, deliberately sought a supercar he could purchase with bitcoin in order to tout the credibility of the currency. \u201cBuying the Lambo with bitcoin is proof it can be used for real transactions, buying really cool stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only used by criminals.\u201d\n\nAs for how much bitcoin he still holds, he says: \u201cThat\u2019s for me to know and you to wonder about.\u201d\n\nPeter Saddington of Atlanta, 35, in front of the Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n he bought in October for 45 Bitcoin, or $238,000.\n\nA California wine executive we interviewed also tried to buy a fancy car with bitcoin \u2014 and he\u2019s grateful the transaction fell through.\n\nThe 55-year-old saw a friend ask about bitcoin in a Facebook post a few years ago. He researched it and began buying a few coins per month, at prices ranging from $225 to $800, until he accumulated about 80 bitcoins. The wine executive had always wanted an Audi A8L, and in 2016 he saw a slightly used model advertised for $50,000. Since bitcoin had fallen to around $600, that was almost exactly how much bitcoin he had. He sold all his coins to finance the car.\n\nThe owner, however, refused to make any concession on price, which scotched the deal. So, what to do with the $50,000? He decided to put it back into bitcoin, even though the price had risen to $900 by then. At that price, he ended up with just 60 bitcoins \u2014 but that\u2019s now worth more than $450,000.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more than $120,000 short because I wanted that stupid car,\u201d the wine executive says. \u201cBut by not buying that car, I made almost half a million in profit.\u201d\n\n[Editor's note: This story originally identified the wine executive. We removed identifying information in April 2023 after he received threats and demands to turn over his bitcoin to a criminal enterprise.]\n\nOthers have invested in cryptocurrencies far more aggressively \u2014 with some paying a steep price. When the Mt. Gox digital exchange collapsed in 2014, more than 24,000 customers lost essentially all their holdings. Some customers had dozens or hundreds of bitcoin stored at Mt. Gox, with losses approaching $1 million or more at today\u2019s value.\n\nMore than half of the respondents to our survey think bitcoin is currently overvalued. Source: Yahoo Finance survey conducted via SurveyMonkey\n\nIn our Yahoo Finance survey, 71% of bitcoin buyers said they\u2019ve made money on their investment. But 8% said they had lost money. The median amount of the loss was $500, but some listed five- and six-digit losses. Of those who have made money on bitcoin, the median gain was $3,000, with a few reporting seven-figure hauls.\n\nThe obvious question now is whether the value of bitcoin will continue going up, or whether a speculative bubble is about to burst.\n\nCounting on bitcoin\n\nMany early buyers think bitcoin is only getting started, and at some point will become a mainstream currency used routinely. \u201cIt\u2019s like the early 1990s, when people were asking, \u2018where is this internet thing going to go?\u2019\u201d says a New York bitcoin investor who asked we identify him by his nickname, Duke. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the early lunatic adopter phase, slowly shifting to the early adopter phase.\u201d\n\nDuke, who teaches technology at a high school, first tried to buy bitcoin in 2011, but a snafu with a PayPal transaction prevented the transaction. The 30-year-old figured he\u2019d get to it later, but the price jumped to more than $1,000 per coin and he assumed he missed the boat. The price came back down, however, and he eventually bought 21 bitcoins, at prices as low as $200.\n\nAt one point, he spent an entire paycheck buying bitcoin.\n\nNow, with a portfolio worth nearly $160,000, he\u2019s reluctant to cash out even a tiny fraction of coin, for fear of missing out on even bigger gains in the future. \u201cA lot of bitcoin holders are kind of afraid to spend it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could end up spending the equivalent of $2 million on a couple of pizzas. Twenty or thirty years from now, if I have grandkids, maybe I\u2019ll be able to pay for their colleges.\u201d\n\nBy then, maybe schools will even accept tuition payments in bitcoin.\n\nRead more:\n\nRick Newman is the author of four books, including Rebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.

        "title": "How much energy does Bitcoin mining consume? Look to Texas. - The Week",
        "content": "Texas has declared itself open for Bitcoin mining, an energy-intensive endeavor that involves warehouses of powerful computers trying to solve complex mathematical problems to unlock valuable cryptocurrency tokens. Texas also has an increasingly strained power grid that serves only Texas and keeps failing or threatening to overload during winter storms and summer heatwaves.\n\nThis combination of Bitcoin miners' voracious appetite for energy and the finite and capricious quantity of power produced in Texas has led to massive cryptocurrency mines earning money for agreeing to shut down in emergencies, raking in more money for shutting down for brief periods, and leaving Texas residents to foot the bill, The New York Times reports. Here's what you need to know about how Bitcoin mining is hurting \u2014 or helping \u2014 Texas energy customers.\n\nHow much energy do Bitcoin mines use?\n\nA lot. The biggest Bitcoin mine in the U.S. \u2014 operated by Riot Platforms in an abandoned Alcoa aluminum smelting plant in Rockdale, Texas, about an hour outside of Austin \u2014 uses the same amount of electricity as the nearest 300,000 homes, the Times reports. Add in the Bitdeer mine about a mile away, and Rockdale's Bitcoin mines use more power than all the houses in a 40-mile radius.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nA 1 megawatt mine consumes more energy per day than a typical U.S. home does in two years. Lee Bratcher, president of Bitcoin lobbying group the Texas Blockchain Council, estimates that Bitcoin miners use about 2,100 MW of power in Texas each day, while the Texas state comptroller's office said cryptocurrency mining operations consume 3,000 MW.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the Texas grid, \"projects that mining operations could rise by 6,000 MW in the next couple years and potentially increase to 17,000 MW by 2030,\" or nearly what Houston \u2014 America's fourth-largest city \u2014 uses during peak demand, the comptroller's office said in an August 2022 report.\n\nOn top of that, \"prospective crypto mining businesses have requested to put approximately 33,000 more megawatts in the ERCOT interconnection queue over the next few years (enough to power the whole state of Florida),\" The Texas Observer reports, though nobody expects all of those requests to come to fruition.\n\nWorldwide, in July 2022 Bitcoin mining used the annualized equivalent of 132 terawatt-hours of electricity, \"comparable to the power consumption of Argentina,\" the Texas comptroller's office said. \"A single bitcoin transaction used nearly 1,452 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, equal to the power consumption of an average U.S. household for nearly 50 days.\"\n\nHow have Bitcoin mines turned that into cold hard cash?\n\n\"Their massive energy consumption combined with their ability to shut off almost instantly allows some companies to save money and make money by deftly pulling the levers of U.S. power markets,\" the Times reports. A significant portion of the revenue large Texas crypto mines rake in comes from their participation in ERCOT's Responsive Reserve Service program, designed to protect the power grid during periods of heavy use.\n\nThe program pays them for their participation and their promise to power down if the grid approaches blackout levels. \"In practice, they rarely are asked to shut down,\" the Times reports. \"Several of the companies are being paid through these agreements a majority of the time they operate. Most years, they are asked to turn off for only a few hours, at which point they are paid even more.\"\n\nBitcoin miners can also avoid fees Texas charges to maintain and bolster the power grid by strategically powering down during peak demand, when those fees are assessed. And when power prices are high, the miners can also shut down and resell their allotted electricity \u2014 which they prepurchase at low rates \u2014 for hefty profits.\n\nThe Times gave two examples of how this works. During 2021's Winter Storm Uri, during which about 40 Texans froze to death during extended blackouts, ERCOT paid Bitdeer's Bitcoin mine in Rockdale an average of $175,000 an hour for not operating, earning the company more than $18 million over four days \u2014 \"from fees ultimately paid by Texans who had endured the storm,\" the Times adds. Another Bitcoin company made tens of millions reselling electricity during Uri.\n\nDuring one day of a June 2022 heatwave, when Riot was earning $342,000 a day mining Bitcoin at its Rockdale facility, it also earned $42,000 from midnight to 4 a.m. for participating in the Responsive Reserve Service program and saved $5.5 million in fees by shutting down from about 4 a.m. to 6:30 a.m. In July 2022, The Texas Observer adds, the same Riot Bitcoin facility earned more from curtailing energy use, $9.5 million, than the $5.6 million in profit it earned mining Bitcoin.\n\nFor all of 2022, the Times reports, Riot made $9.3 million from participating in the blackout-prevention service (despite being asked to reduce power for only about 3.5 hours), saved about $27 million in potential fees, and earned roughly $18 million from reselling electricity to other customers. Riot earned $156.9 million from Bitcoin mining last year.\n\nIs this how the Texas grid is supposed to work?\n\nERCOT told the Times it \"does not discriminate based on the type or activity\" of the companies that sign up for its Responsive Reserve Service program. \"We want to be able to serve any business that wants to do business in Texas,\" Pablo Vegas, ERCOT's new CEO, said in November. \"And that includes crypto miners.\"\n\n\"There's a set of rules that exist,\" Carey King, assistant director of the Energy Institute at The University of Texas at Austin, told the Observer. And the crypto miners do \"fit the definition of being able to provide ... emergency response services.\"\n\n\"I think they're exploiting the system,\" Severin Bornstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told the Times. \"But they will say, 'You know, the system was already there,' and I'm sympathetic to that in some ways.\"\n\nHow does this make energy more expensive for regular Texans?\n\nThe cost of Bitcoin miners reselling electricity during peak demand falls on consumers, University of Houston energy economist Ed Hirs tells the Times. \"Ironically, when people are paying the most for their power, or losing it altogether, the miners are making money selling energy back to Texans at rates 100 times what they paid.\"\n\nThere's also a cost from the miners' enormous power consumption. Bitcoin miners say they set up camp in areas where they can use otherwise unusable renewable energy, but their energy needs are so great they actually get 85 percent of their energy from coal and natural gas plants, causing \"as much carbon pollution as adding 3.5 million gas-powered cars to America's roads,\" the Times reports, citing an analysis by tech nonprofit WattTime.\n\nThe 1,800 MW used by the 10 Bitcoin mines connected to the Texas grid require more expensive power generators to come online, and this \"increased demand has caused electric bills for power customers to rise nearly 5 percent, or $1.8 billion per year,\" the Times reports, citing a simulation performed by energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. \"In West Texas, where several Bitcoin mines have settled, bills have increased by nearly 9 percent.\"\n\nA group of seven federal lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), asked ERCOT about the state's cryptocurrency boom and power consumption last fall. \"Given the impacts of crypto-mining on the climate, the grid, and to ratepayers, ERCOT's support for this industry is irresponsible and highly concerning,\" they wrote.\n\n\"It's a massive financial burden to Texans,\" Wood Mackenzie's Ben Hertz-Shargel told the Times. And because of how the Texas market operates, the increases are steepest for residential customers. Riot, for example, told investors that due to its various strategies, it paid 2.96 cents per kilowatt-hour last year. \"By comparison, the average price for other industrial businesses in Texas was 7.2 cents,\" the Times reports. \"For residents, it was 13.5 cents.\"\n\nWhat do Bitcoin proponents say?\n\nBitcoin miners and their supporters highlight the benefits they bring to rural communities and argue that their sizable energy usage will encourage the construction of more power plants, especially wind and solar generation that isn't yet able to circulate on the grid due to a lack of transmission lines. The Bitcoin companies also say the criticism of them is unjust.\n\nThe analysis cited by the Times \"could be used to attack any industry that consumes power,\" said David Fogel, the chief executive of Coinmint. \"I think the entire notion of singling out specific industries like this is unfair.\"\n\n\"The thing about crypto is that they're really not doing anything that is useful,\" counters Molly White, a software engineer and cryptocurrency researcher. \"It is primarily used for speculation. I think that's important to realize. And that is somehow worth the electricity usage of small countries? That blows my mind.\"\n\nIs Texas doing anything to addresses Bitcoin mining's power consumption?\n\nYes. The Texas Senate unanimously passed legislation in April that would cap Bitcoin miners' participation in ERCOT's demand response program at 10 percent, require them to shut down during peak demand anyway, and eliminate tax incentives \u2014 and the Bitcoin lobby is working hard to make sure it fails in the House. Bitcoin boosters are pushing a \"Don't Mess With Texas Innovation\" campaign aimed at stopping this \"anticompetitive\" bill, SB 1751.\n\nThe Texas Senate also sent the House a bill that aims to stabilize the power grid by building natural gas\u2013powered power plants that could generate up to 10 gigawatts of electricity in emergency situations. The Senate touted estimates that it would cost $10.8 billion to build the plants, but an estimate by the quasi-government Lower Colorado River Authority said it could cost $18 million. It isn't clear if the state would pay for the backup power generators with reserve funds or have ERCOT pass the costs onto energy customers.\n\nThe proposal, a priority for Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) \"has many opponents,\" KUT Austin reports. \"Environmental groups are concerned with the amount of extra carbon dioxide-emitting fossil fuel generation it would lock into the state's energy mix. Existing power plant companies say it would destroy the Texas competitive energy market. Meanwhile, consumer advocates point out it would greatly increase already-rising Texas electricity bills.\"\n\nHow did Texas end up with all these Bitcoin mines in the first place?\n\nBasically, Texas invited Bitcoin miners in, and they accepted, drawn in by cheap energy and comparatively few regulations. They need to go somewhere. Bitcoin mines used to be centered in China, but due in part to the industry's massive energy consumption, Beijing declared crypto mining \"undesirable\" and banned it in 2021. Many miners moved to Iran and Kazakhstan, which also cracked down. Texas rolled out the red carpet.\n\n\"Texas will be the crypto leader,\" tweeted Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who also hosted the Texas Blockchain Council at the governor's mansion. ERCOT's former chief declared himself \"pro-Bitcoin.\" For the Bitcoin miners, \"the main attraction is cheap wholesale electricity prices,\" said UT's King.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency mining can operate from anywhere in the world,\" the Texas comptroller report noted. \"It is not bound by transportation networks or access to raw materials or a specialized workforce. What its data centers do require is a massive amount of electricity to cool and operate the mining machinery, and Texas provides an attractive draw for such needs.\" And if that ever changes, they can move on to somewhere else, leaving Texas with a whole lot more power."

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining & Rural Missouri: An Electrifying Future - The Missouri Times",
        "content": "Bitcoin Mining & Rural Missouri: An Electrifying Future\n\nWhile many have heard of Bitcoin, few understand Bitcoin mining and its relevance in the world. Bitcoin mining is a vibrant, growing, worldwide competitive data processing business that is here to stay, and Missouri sits on a golden opportunity to attract digital gold miners to the Show-Me State.\n\nBitcoin mining is thousands of specialized computers called ASICs, competing to find the solution to cryptographic hashes in a race repeated every 10 minutes. This process is called Proof of Work (PoW). The winner of each race gets to construct the block that holds all transactions on the network for that period, rewarded with Bitcoin. Every 10 minutes the Bitcoin network pays 6.25 Bitcoin valued at ~$190,000 USD to miners.\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s hashing power continues to rise to new highs, Bitcoin miners seek low cost energy to add processing power to the network. Key to Bitcoin mining competitiveness is electricity cost, the only controllable variable expense. The Bitcoin network incentivizes miners to be good actors, requiring significant investment in hardware and electrical infrastructure used by machines for the Proof of Work process.\n\nElectricity is the largest production expense, and data centers, with dozens, hundreds, sometimes thousands of computers, run continuously every day. Therein, lies opportunity for rural Missouri. Traditional data centers are usually in urban areas with high bandwidth network access to carry data. Bitcoin miners prioritize lowest energy rates wherever those opportunities exist. Not for profit, rural Missouri co-ops keep costs low and profit above operating costs is returned to members.\n\nWhile rural Missouri enjoys low industrial electricity rates, there is opportunity for efficiency improvements. In winter, people run high energy devices like electric furnaces, adding demand to the electrical grid. This is called peak demand and happens only a few days of the year. Power generating plants must forecast this peak demand and cooperatives are charged for the year based on the previous year peak. Put simply, they are charged for electricity demand that only exists for a small portion of the year.\n\nThe golden opportunity is to invite Bitcoin miners to build data centers where these peak demand imbalances occur and sell them low-cost electricity. Attractive to miners, lowest energy costs will be optimized, adding an additional revenue stream to co-ops. When peaks happen, Bitcoin miners can switch off their computers on demand and immediately free up the electricity for other uses. When the peak event passes, the miners come back online.\n\nSummary\n\nRural coops can recover power \u201clost\u2019 because of peaks and rural Missouri Bitcoin miners can be competitive with lower energy costs. Mining opportunities create jobs, pour money into rural economies and tax revenues to the state. Utilizing power already purchased and wasted, Bitcoin mining can provide tremendous value to rural electric cooperatives throughout the state."

        "content": "If you\u2019re an institutional investor with an interest in bitcoin, but you are either restricted from or simply hesitant about buying the digital currency directly, then what are your options? Looking at recent events, it appears that an alternative path by which you can increase your exposure to bitcoin, without actually holding any bitcoin, is by increasing your exposure to MicroStrategy instead.\n\nWhy Is MicroStrategy Synonymous With Bitcoin?\n\nBack in August 2020, the Co-Founder and then-CEO of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, signaled through the company\u2019s first purchase of $250 million worth of bitcoin that he was taking the cryptocurrency seriously. For Saylor, not only was bitcoin a deeply important financial innovation, but it had become the most efficient and effective means of storing wealth.\n\nAnd, this wasn\u2019t to be a partial move, as Saylor then decisively went about the task of making bitcoin the primary treasury reserve asset at MicroStrategy. Thus, since 2020, the company has acquired 140,000 BTC at an average cost of $29,803 per coin.\n\nFurthermore, Saylor has become one of the most prominent public advocates for bitcoin, its utility, and the conviction that it will, in time, become the strongest asset in existence.\n\nKeep Reading Nigeria Presses Binance amid Economic Turmoil and Detains Executives\n\nIn this capacity, Michael Saylor has delivered countless interviews on platforms, ranging from crypto-native niche podcasts to mainstream channels, such as CNBC and Fox News. Additionally, he changed his position within MicroStrategy, becoming the Executive Chairman in August 2022, and announcing at the time that he would \u201cbe able to focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s latest bitcoin acquisition came at the beginning of this month, with an announcement that it had purchased another 1,045 coins, at an average price of $28,016 per coin.\n\nMicroStrategy has acquired an additional 1,045 #bitcoin for ~ $29.3M at an average price of $28,016 per bitcoin. As of 4/4/2023 @MicroStrategy holds 140,000 bitcoin acquired for ~$4.17 billion at an average price of $29,803 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/IBufTxalnv \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) April 5, 2023\n\nInstitutions Increase Exposure to MicroStrategy\n\nAs MicroStrategy is now well known for its bitcoin holdings, and Michael Saylor has taken on a role involving bitcoin advocacy, any increases in institutional ownership of MicroStrategy shares are notable as possible indicators of wider interest in bitcoin.\n\nYear-to-date reports show that in Q1 of this year, institutional ownership of MicroStrategy shares increased 121%, and that figure includes some sudden increases in exposure by major entities, with the biggest purchases coming from Bank of America, which increased its holdings by almost $60 million, followed by Capital Group and Fidelity Investments.\n\nBank of America is now the fourth largest MicroStrategy shareholder, behind Capital, Vanguard and BlackRock, with Vanguard and BlackRock also increasing their holdings.\n\nMicroStrategy as a Bitcoin Proxy\n\nAs observed, MicroStrategy has, seemingly deliberately, become synonymous with bitcoin, and now holds an amount approaching 0.7% of the total bitcoin that can ever exist (the future total supply is capped at 21 million).\n\nWith no spot bitcoin ETF currently approved in the US, if a large entity is interested in the leading cryptocurrency but wants to avoid directly buying and taking custody with all the logistical complications and attention that would involve, then it would be logical to explore other routes towards gaining exposure. And, buying shares in MicroStrategy presents an easily executable, indirect option. Simply put, exposure to MicroStrategy equates to exposure to bitcoin.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, these increases in exposure to MicroStrategy and its digital treasury came immediately after the crypto bear market appears to have bottomed out. Moving on from 2022's downward bleed, which culminated in the collapse of FTX, the new year has subsequently brought what looks like a change in bitcoin\u2019s trend structure on the price charts, and the digital currency has hugely outperformed other asset classes since the beginning of 2023.\n\nIt appears, then, that at this juncture in bitcoin\u2019s history, when the asset\u2019s presence has come to look solidly resilient but American regulatory bodies are still reluctant to fully open the doors, MicroStrategy is acting as a temporary bitcoin proxy and functioning almost as a makeshift bitcoin ETF.\n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s notable that this should be occurring, along with a rally in bitcoin\u2019s price to volley it back over $30,000, during a period US authorities have been taking explicit aim at crypto platforms, such as Coinbase, Kraken and Binance, and after crypto-friendly banks Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank ran into fatal problems.\n\nVeteran bitcoin advocates will tell you that none of these events is a reflection on the value of bitcoin itself, but rather, are the result of other cryptocurrencies being classifiable as unregistered securities, or, in some cases, due to mismanagement at particular crypto companies, exchanges, and banks.\n\nOn the other hand, bitcoin (as distinct from crypto, or the crypto industry) continues to operate reliably, as it has since its inception. And, it seems now that institutions may be not only picking up on that message but looking to act on it through whichever avenues currently happen to be the most expedient."

        "content": "Billionaire investor Howard Marks has warmed up to crypto, and especially bitcoin, over the past few years.\n\nIn a recent podcast appearance, he recalled his January 2021 memo to Oaktree Capital Management clients titled \u201cSomething of Value,\u201d in which Marks concluded he was \u201cnot yet informed enough to form a view on cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nThat was a stark departure from 4 years prior, when Marks\u2019 memorialized thoughts on crypto that played up the speculative mania, calling it \u201cnothing but an unfounded fad (or perhaps even a pyramid scheme).\u201d\n\nA series of discussions with his adult son Andrew during the pandemic \u2014 or, as Marks calls it, \u201cmy time in captivity\u201d \u2014 softened his view.\n\n\u201cOur families lived together for three months, and we had some great discussions, as you can imagine,\u201d Marks told We Study Billionaires\u2019 Trey Lockerbie. \u201cAnd it was around April\u2026when Andrew told me he had bought bitcoin,\u201d for between $5,000 and $6,000.\n\nAndrew Marks is the co-managing partner of TQ Ventures, a technology-focused venture capital firm, who has described himself as a huge Buffet nerd, but one who became more open-minded toward tech investments.\n\nHoward Marks characterized his own investing style as \u201ccautious\u201d and remarked on his tendency to be \u201cdeeply dubious when we hear \u2018this time it\u2019s different.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe point to a history of speculative manias and financial innovations that\u2019s left behind significant carnage. It\u2019s this skepticism that reduces the value investor\u2019s probability of losing money,\u201d he said.\n\nA sea change\n\nSo, what\u2019s changed?\n\nA macro-driven sea change is in process, Marks said, calling the 40-year decline in interest rates \u201cthe biggest single event of the last 45 years in the financial world.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike the frog in the pot of water,\u201d the gradual decline in interest rates, \u201cwere responsible for the majority of all the money that\u2019s been made in the last 45 years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision to leave interest rates at zero for the 7 years following the global financial crisis of 2008 was a mistake, in Marks\u2019 view. Now interest rates are \u201cgoing to kind of hang around at this level\u201d \u2014 but not go up.\n\nMarks even expects the Fed will cut rates in 2024, though it won\u2019t be by much. \u201cThey\u2019re through coming down in any major way,\u201d he added, and \u201cthey\u2019re through being ultra-low.\u201d\n\nMarks praised current Fed Chair Jerome Powell as \u201creasoned,\u201d but \u201cresolute,\u201d in setting expectations for inflation, which Marks predicted \u201cwill abate naturally,\u201d unlike the far worse scenario the country faced in the 1970s.\n\nBitcoin is a product of a loss of trust in the financial system, especially for people in countries with weak institutions and limited access to financial services, he now concludes.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t exactly want everybody in authority to know how much money they have. So it does seem that there are good uses for some coins, and bitcoin seems to be so far the one in the lead.\u201d\n\nCloser to home, bitcoin\u2019s rally is fueled by the recent banking crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an anti-bank play, and the weakness of the bank shows up the strength of bitcoin, and it\u2019s done very, very well this year,\u201d Marks said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Hayek and Bitcoin | AIER - AIER - Daily Economy News",
        "content": "The late economist FA Hayek had a great deal to say about private money, inflation, and indeed, about preserving individual freedoms against a tyrannical state. As we approach the 15th anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper and the currency\u2019s release shortly thereafter, it is worthwhile to reflect on what Hayek might have thought about this technological breakthrough.\n\nIn October 2008, the pseudonymous character Satoshi Nakamoto announced that he had published a paper explaining how a peer-to-peer \u201celectronic cash system\u201d could work \u201cwith no trusted third party.\u201d In January the next year, he launched Bitcoin with mention of an article in the British newspaper The Times: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d What was implied was that the release of this peer-to-peer electronic cash system was a response to the cronyism he saw in central banking during the Global Financial Crisis.\n\nUnfortunately, Hayek passed long before Bitcoin\u2019s inception, but in his book The Denationalisation of Money, he argued for nothing short of stripping the state of its monopoly power of money itself. Beyond this, Hayek imagined an economic system in which \u201cseveral concurrent, distinct kinds of money are simultaneously in use in the same territory.\u201d As such, if Bitcoin had been around during Hayek\u2019s lifetime, he likely would not have advocated (as many bitcoiners do) to \u201cbitcoinize everything,\u201d precisely because a single money existing everywhere was hardly what he had in mind. Hayek wanted competition in money.\n\nSly and unstoppable\n\nHayek certainly would have appreciated Bitcoin\u2019s unwavering resistance to political pressure. But, above all, I like to think that Hayek would have appreciated Bitcoin for at least two other important reasons: it is both sly, and nearly impossible to stop. In a 1984 interview, Hayek stated that:\n\nI don\u2019t believe we shall ever have good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government. If we can\u2019t take it violently out of the hands of government, [then] all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can\u2019t stop.\n\nThe key to the \u201csly roundabout way\u201d that Satoshi put together (having borrowed from those before him) was that Bitcoin was merely a protocol \u2013 a TCP/IP of money \u2013 one that quickly became highly decentralized, meaning that no parties would be capable of controlling it for their own benefit. And by being an internet-native digital asset, there would be no centralized point of failure in the real world, with tangible, backed assets that could be seized to shut the whole thing down (as happened to at least two asset-backed, privately issued digital currencies before Bitcoin).\n\nBitcoin and gold\n\nSatoshi sought to imitate gold, albeit in the digital world. In the Bitcoin whitepaper, he wrote that \u201cThe steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation\u2026 [although in] our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\u201d So what did Hayek think about gold?\n\nHayek wrote that if gold were to remain in the hands of government, that he considered this metallic standard to be \u201cthe only tolerably safe system.\u201d But gold also stood only as \u201ca very wobbly anchor\u201d to protect against \u201crisks of fraud by government\u201d and \u201cwould never be as good a money as one issued by an agency whose whole business rested on its success in providing a money the public preferred to other kinds.\u201d\n\nHayek also argued that gold gave us a \u201csemi-automatic regulation of the quantity of money\u201d (something he viewed favorably), but he may have also found interesting the idea of an impenetrable algorithmic monetary policy, which Bitcoin provides.\n\nWhat Hayek considered to be a better money than gold was his own proposal for a money issued by banks under a state of competition in money, and backed by real assets. Economist Lawrence H. White, however, rightly distinguishes between \u201cHayek\u2019s proposal\u2014to allow free choice and private competition in currency\u2014from his prediction about what type of money would then dominate the field.\u201d\n\nHayek also believed that the public was likely to prefer a money \u201cwhose purchasing power it could expect to be stable.\u201d Such a stable purchasing power in money, he wrote, would reduce the strain on debtor-creditor relations (a subject that Hayek covers in detail in his book).\n\nWhite argues in his own new book Better Money: Gold, Fiat or Bitcoin? that a rise in purchasing power in gold instigates (through the profit motive) a response to produce more gold \u201cuntil purchasing power returns to trend.\u201d By contrast, as a similar rise in purchasing power for Bitcoin cannot provoke a similar increase in the supply of bitcoins beyond the protocol\u2019s fixed, coded supply schedule, there are \u201cno expectations of [mean] reversion to dampen volatility.\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nWhether Bitcoin\u2019s purchasing power will stabilize over time sufficiently for it to become a commonly used medium of exchange is a topic of ongoing heated debate. From my point of view, what Bitcoin sacrifices in terms of stable purchasing power by being unresponsive to increases in demand, it makes up for enormously elsewhere as a superior rules-based monetary system, neither subject to human discretion of central planners nor to miners that may wish to create more units than its supply schedule is programmed to create. This is precisely why the masses may inevitably adopt it (whenever their governments are incapable or uninterested in deterring them from doing so), not only as a store of value but also as a medium of exchange. And by having an internet-native digital asset that does not respond to external forces for its supply, we achieve a radically decentralized money, unprecedented in human history.\n\nAdditionally, enough of Bitcoin\u2019s users don\u2019t seem to mind the volatility enough to abandon it, and its widespread use keeps growing: both on-chain and on its so-called second layer. And, in fact, the present crackdown against it \u2013 especially in the United States and Europe \u2013 as well as the rush to implement CBDCs around the world, each suggest that regulators are worried about just how powerful it is.\n\nSo, would Hayek like Bitcoin? I never knew Hayek, but I think he would have loved what it represented as well as the extent to which it takes money out of the hands of the state (as people around the world transact peer-to-peer, permissionlessly, with this stateless digital asset). Bitcoin is that sly, roundabout way that they might never stop. Oh, and remember Satoshi\u2019s mention of The Times article about bank bailouts? By seemingly enormous coincidence, Satoshi (assuming he was unaware at the time), would have probably been delighted to learn that in Hayek\u2019s same \u201csly roundabout way\u201d video interview, he held up a copy of The Times newspaper and declared: \u201cI read this everyday.\u201d Great minds think alike."

        "content": "Standard Chartered predicts bitcoin could fall to $5,000 in 2023 as part of its research on potential market surprises next year.\n\nCryptocurrencies fell on Monday as investors put excitement from Ethereum's \"Shapella\" upgrade behind them and refocused on upcoming bank earnings and recession concerns.\n\nBitcoin fell more than 3.3% to $29,478.54, according to Coin Metrics, falling below the key $30,000 it hit last week for the first time since June. Meanwhile, ether was lower by 2.4% but maintained the $2,000 it broke through last week.\n\nCrypto is coming off a winning week in which prices were boosted by optimism around Ethereum's latest tech upgrade, dubbed \"Shapella\" (also known as \"Shanghai\"). The update is meant to bring greater liquidity to the network by allowing \"locked up\" ether to be withdrawn and ultimately draw in more institutional interest in the long term. Bitcoin and ether advanced 8% and 12%, respectively, for the week.\n\nThis week, it wouldn't be surprising to see a small correction in prices, according to Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank, and there could be some selling pressure as some investors may want to take profits from the previous week.\n\nWhile crypto was rallying, \"Friday's U.S. stock market showed unstable movements as stronger-than-expected consumer sentiment and Fed's Waller's speech strengthened the possibility of another rate hike in May,\" Hasegawa said. \"Nevertheless, the Fed Funds futures market has already priced in more than 80% chance of a 25bp hike in May, so pressures from macro factors on the price of bitcoin is expected to be limited.\"\n\nCrypto investors are watching bank earnings this week for more insight about the health of the sector and possibility of a coming recession. Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak this week too.\n\n\"We haven't seen crypto perform in a high-rate, slowing growth environment until now,\" said Callie Cox, analyst at investing company eToro. \"It's anyone's guess how crypto acts during a recession.\"\n\nFor this week, any downside potential \"should not be severe\" or keep bitcoin from continuing on its uptrend, Hasegawa said."

Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded lower, with the exception of Solana, the BNB token of the Binance exchange, and Litecoin. U.S. equity futures moved higher after gains last week, though they lost some steam on Friday amid a mixed outlook for the economy.\n\nSee related article: Kraken to withdraw US$1.17 bln of staked Ether in line with SEC ruling, settlement\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin fell 1.47% to US$29,858 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, but is still up 5.13% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The token briefly breached the US$31,000 mark on Friday but then fluctuated above US$30,000 over the weekend.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s gains last week came amid optimism around the Ethereum upgrade and signs of a slowdown in U.S. inflation in March. Lower inflation usually encourages buying of risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, said Marat Minkin, co-founder of decentralized finance payment app TONBanking. Cathy Wood, the CEO of investment manager Ark Invest, said on Friday that uncertainty about the outlook for the U.S. economy is also driving the safe-haven message around cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum dipped 0.40% to US$2,082.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.19%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.17% and the Nasdaq Composite Index inched 0.01% higher.\n\nThe three indexes dipped Friday, though all logged gains for the week, as U.S. economic data sent mixed information to investors on what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates at its next meeting on May 3. Consumer sentiment ticked up in April, according to a report on Friday, while retail sales fell in March, both readings that suggest inflation is cooling.\n\nHowever, first-quarter earnings of major banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co, beat expectations, suggesting a stronger economy that may feed inflation, according to a Reuters report on Friday.\n\nU.S. interest rates are currently between 4.75% to 5%, the highest since June 2006, and analysts at the CME Group now see a 17.9% chance the Fed will not raise interest rates at its next meeting on May 3, while 82.1% predict a 25-basis-point rate hike,up from 66.5% last Friday.\n\nSee related article: Forkast NFT indexes reveal the hidden costs of y00ts, DeGods\u2019 moves across blockchains"

        "content": "Michael Ghen, the leader of DeFi Philly, talks decentralized finance and blockchain technology at a meet up in Northern Liberties. Read more\n\nAt age 73, Yoav Zohar is an outlier among the Millennials and Gen Z who make up most of the cryptocurrency community.\n\nWhile many were still in grade school, Zohar learned about the booms and busts of new technology during the dot-com explosion of the early 2000s.\n\nSo when it comes to crypto \u2014 digital money that isn\u2019t tied to a central bank \u2014 Zohar won\u2019t hold more than $5 worth.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to invest in it, because I think my money\u2019s more important than doing experiments,\u201d laughed Zohar at DeFi Philly, a meeting for decentralized finance enthusiasts in Northern Liberties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf 2022 was any indicator, his prudence paid off.\n\nIt was a particularly brutal year for Bitcoin, which swelled in valuation last spring before plummeting in May. What would follow was blow after blow for the highly volatile industry.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: South Philadelphia crypto company hit with more lawsuits, detailing a pyramidlike rewards system\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price fell by over 60%, and around $2 trillion disappeared from the market overall, as wealthy investors pulled out while the little guy was left in the red. Then came high-profile scandals, including the downfall of the exchange FTX and its billionaire-turned-fraudster CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. In a domino-like effect, crypto hedge funds shuttered, and President Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u2014 which had been hesitant to get involved \u2014 began a sweeping attempt to regulate the industry.\n\nCrypto\u2019s fall has particularly affected Black and brown Americans who, feeling shut out of traditional financial markets, were more likely to invest \u2014 and ultimately lose.\n\nZohar read the headlines. So he comes to DeFi mainly for the pizza, drinks, and passionate talk about what was perhaps prematurely crowned the future of finance.\n\nAmong the 15 or so other attendees, this conservative outlook was rare. While some agreed that Bitcoin has had its day \u2014 for now \u2014 there was the sense that something bigger and better was on the horizon.\n\n\u201cPolyDoge, that\u2019s the one that popped off for me,\u201d said a member who asked to go by Tom \u201cT-Bytes\u201d so employers don\u2019t know about his investments.\n\nHe\u2019s talking about an altcoin \u2014 there are thousands of cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin \u2014 that\u2019s worth $0.000000008299. It\u2019s an offshoot of Dogecoin, the widely memed crypto that\u2019s periodically resurfaced by Twitter owner Elon Musk.\n\nT-Bytes claimed he turned a profit on the risky investment and is now looking to other coins. But not all of his investments have pumped.\n\nWearing a tie-dye purple shirt, T-Bytes is not the only member to admit facing losses after last year\u2019s downturn (they\u2019re reluctant to call it a crash).\n\nKaseem Dodson became crypto curious early last year, just before prices went south. Dodson, 33, sees Bitcoin\u2019s hibernation as just another bear market. Rumor of a coming rebound keeps him vested in the industry.\n\nDodson also likes that crypto has, so far, been resistant to government regulation. But that feature has led a myriad of hucksters to take advantage of rosy-eyed investors with little knowledge of how crypto functions.\n\nThis month alone, the U.S. Justice Department recovered over $112 million in \u201cpig butchering\u201d schemes, where scammers contact victims through messaging apps with enticing offers on high-return investments. Once the Bitcoin is transferred, you can guess what happens next.\n\nAnd in Philadelphia, it remains to be seen whether victims of VBit Technologies will ever see the $11 million-plus frozen in their virtual accounts after the Washington Avenue-based company folded last summer. After VBit\u2019s lawyers dropped the embroiled company this month citing silence from its elusive CEO, the outcomes of the mounting federal lawsuits against it are hazy.\n\nThose are the scams. Other initiatives, while aboveboard, have yet to fully transform Philly into a crypto-forward hot spot like Miami or San Francisco.\n\nSoon after announcing a plan to incorporate crypto into city funding, City Hall nixed the idea. Meanwhile, scores of collectible NFTs from regional names like Wawa and the 76ers either remain unsold or are being hawked for ridiculous sums. And while a West Philadelphia house that advertised a built-in crypto miner initially made a splash, a publicly available ledger shows that today it reaps just around $14 per month.\n\nNone of this fazes 30-year-old Michael Ghen, a computer engineer and DeFi\u2019s leader, though he\u2019s frustrated at the public\u2019s perception of crypto as a back-alley market. Sympathetic to stories of losses to fraudsters, he created a guide for newcomers that outlines the mechanisms behind popular scams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s buyer beware,\u201d Ghen said.\n\nMinimizing the public\u2019s risk is a Herculean task, exemplified by the nearly 100 Bitcoin ATMs scattered throughout Philadelphia \u2014 ones that law enforcement warn are highly efficient vehicles for fraud, often in low-income communities.\n\nGhen said foreign hackers give crypto a bad name. Still, the industry is grappling with the recklessness of its former darlings like Bankman-Fried, who was arrested and faces multiple charges for mismanaging customer funds after his Bahamas-based trading company imploded in November.\n\nOne group had an idea, printing the disgraced 31-year-old\u2019s face across toilet paper at a recent crypto conference.\n\nHow larger financial institutions \u2014 including Pennsylvania billionaire Jeff Yass and his Bala Cynwyd-based Susquehanna International Group \u2014 are handling their crypto hedges is unclear, though the trend of big players pulling out of the market is on the rise.\n\nLike the statue of Don Quixote that towers over Girard Avenue, maybe you\u2019ve just got to believe. It\u2019s a block away from where Ghen and DeFi Philly are keeping the faith.\n\nIt\u2019s also near where the tech entrepreneur Thomas Jay Rush led a talk called \u201cWhat the Mennonites Can Teach us About Blockchains,\u201d a reference to the systems that record crypto transactions.\n\nWhether the neo-Luddite cousins of the Amish are invested in Bitcoin was never mentioned. Instead, Rush lauded their ability to stay tight-knit and quickly raise a barn, a metaphor for how decentralized finance can weather the future.\n\n\u201cAll communities come together,\u201d Rush said with all the optimism of a Crypto.com Super Bowl advertisement circa 2022. \u201cThey do things individuals cannot possibly do.\u201d"

        "content": "Recent turmoil in the banking sector has shown that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) can withstand a shaky economy, outperform other asset classes and function like gold, says ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood \u2014 butone long-time investor still isn\u2019t sold.\n\nWood said in an April 15 interview that Bitcoin\u2019s resilience throughout the most recent banking crisis has been \u201cthe most remarkable\u201d of all indicators her tech-focused investment management firm is monitoring.\n\nBitcoin and Ether are now acting as \u201crisk-off\u201d assets and as a \u201cflight to safety\u201d for investors amid macroeconomic uncertainty, she claimed:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to disrupt the traditional world order. What are Bitcoin and Ether doing? I mean by the very fact that they\u2019re being considered flight to safety like gold, that\u2019s really interesting and suggests much broader-based adoption and acceptance than I think most people understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would say that there is a flight to safety, certainly led by crypto assets, and it is telling us that the world is transforming and will continue to transform. You cannot stop innovation,\u201d she added.\n\nWhy have bitcoin and other crypto assets appreciated during this banking crisis? In our view and in contrast to those in the traditional financial world, many crypto assets face no central points of failure: they are decentralized, transparent, and auditable. \u2014 Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) March 23, 2023\n\nWood thinks cryptocurrency will eventually become an \u201celection issue\u201d when the sector becomes more broadly accepted, and the public can more clearly see the kinds of regulatory pressure that the United States government is applying on the industry to maintain centralized control of money and monetary policy.\n\nNot all share Wood\u2019s sentiment.\n\nRay Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates \u2014 the world\u2019s largest hedge fund by assets under management \u2014 said in an April 12 interview that Bitcoin could not serve as an \u201ceffective currency\u201d because it is too volatile and central banks won\u2019t adopt it:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is neither an effective store hold of wealth or a medium of exchange so it is not an effective currency. It has a volatility to it that has no relation to practically anything [...] it\u2019s a very, very poor alternative to gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can outlaw [Bitcoin]. They can regulate it. Central banks and countries pretty much don\u2019t want it anyway,\u201d he said, adding that it gets attention \u201cway out of proportion\u201d to its size.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin likely to outperform all crypto assets following banking crisis, analyst explains\n\nDalio strengthened his case by pointing out that gold is the third largest reserve held by central banks, trailing only the U.S. dollar and euros.\n\nDespite previously describing Bitcoin as \u201cone hell of an invention,\u201d Dalio recently said that he instead wants to see an \u201cinflation-linked\u201d coin be built that would serve to ensure consumers secure their buying power.\n\nMagazine: Unstablecoins: Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom"

        "title": "Stacks (STX): What if Bitcoin Had Smart Contracts? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Bitcoin maxis, beware! The Stacks crypto project is here to extend the Bitcoin blockchain beyond its limitations, bringing improved functionality to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency network.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns about Bitcoin (BTC) is its lack of utility outside of being a self-custodial digital asset payment network. The Stacks blockchain liberates Bitcoin from these limitations, building DeFi apps and NFTs on top of Bitcoin\u2019s impenetrable security.\n\nWhat is Stacks (STX)? How does this innovative Bitcoin layer work behind the scenes? Is it truly a threat to other smart contract-capable networks like Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA)?\n\nWhat Is Stacks (STX)?\n\nStacks is a Layer-1 blockchain capable of supporting smart contracts. It aims to unlock the full potential of Bitcoin by providing an ecosystem of dApps and products that are settled on the world\u2019s most secure and decentralized blockchain.\n\nNot only does the Stacks network bring greater utility to Bitcoin, but it also seeks to resolve its scalability issues with higher transaction throughput. Could Stacks be the ultimate solution to Vitalik Buterin\u2019s symbolic blockchain trilemma?\n\nWhy Does Bitcoin Need Stacks?\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s position as the world\u2019s top cryptocurrency, it\u2019s often criticized as being nothing more than a decentralized store of value. As a payment network, many alternative blockchains like XRP are faster and more affordable.\n\nOn top of that, the Bitcoin blockchain doesn\u2019t support smart contracts, making it infinitely less useful than a network like Ethereum that hosts a multitude of DeFi apps. Apart from sending and receiving BTC between wallets, there\u2019s not much you can do with Bitcoin.\n\nAs a digital asset, BTC represents over $500 billion of liquidity but offers no way to leverage this value creatively. For example, there are no decentralized exchanges or lending platforms on Bitcoin.\n\nStacks solves this problem and brings integral blockchain functions, like decentralized finance and NFT technology, to the Bitcoin network.\n\nHow Does Stacks Work?\n\nThe Stacks network is an execution layer that settles complex transactions using the Bitcoin blockchain as a base layer.\n\nAt the core of this process are two unique features of the Stacks protocol. These are the Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) consensus algorithm and the Clarity programming language.\n\nProof-of-Transfer (PoX)\n\nThe Proof-of-Transfer consensus mechanism is the key link between Stacks and Bitcoin. It\u2019s an extension of the Proof-of-Burn algorithm, wherein miners burn crypto as a proxy in exchange for computing resources to secure the chain.\n\nInstead of burning tokens in exchange for computing resources, tokens are committed to the Stacks protocol and transferred between network participants. We call these Miners and Stackers.\n\nSource: Stacks\n\nMiners transfer BTC to Stackers, hoping to win block rewards and transaction fees from the Stacks network. The chances of winning the block correspond to the amount of BTC committed.\n\nOn the hand, Stackers lock their STX tokens to the network in exchange for BTC committed to the network by Miners. After their lock-up period is complete, Stackers reclaim their STX tokens.\n\nClarity\n\nClarity is a smart contract programming language unique to the Stacks network. It\u2019s optimized for predictability and security and was specifically designed to combat common exploits seen in Solidity, Ethereum\u2019s dominant language.\n\nHere are some of the key features of the Clarity programming language:\n\nUncompiled \u2013 Clarity contracts are committed to the network exactly as they are written. In many other languages, contracts are compiled into byte-code before being submitted to the chain. This leaves room for the contract\u2019s missing aspects in translation, potentially opening the door to vulnerabilities.\n\n\u2013 Clarity contracts are committed to the network exactly as they are written. In many other languages, contracts are compiled into byte-code before being submitted to the chain. This leaves room for the contract\u2019s missing aspects in translation, potentially opening the door to vulnerabilities. Decidability \u2013 When writing Clarity contracts, developers can guarantee that program execution will terminate after a finite number of steps. This also makes it easier to ascertain transaction costs, meaning you\u2019ll never need to worry about running out of gas halfway through a transaction.\n\n\u2013 When writing Clarity contracts, developers can guarantee that program execution will terminate after a finite number of steps. This also makes it easier to ascertain transaction costs, meaning you\u2019ll never need to worry about running out of gas halfway through a transaction. Bitcoin compatible \u2013 Clarity smart contracts are designed to read the state of the native Bitcoin blockchain. This means developers implement Bitcoin transactions directly into their applications for seamless smart contract triggers.\n\nThe STX Token\n\nSTX is the native cryptocurrency of the Stacks blockchain. The Stacks token is used to pay transaction fees on the network and can be \u2018stacked\u2019 to earn BTC through the Proof-of-Exchange consensus mechanism. It\u2019s also used in the network\u2019s various dApps as collateral and a currency of exchange.\n\nInterestingly enough, Stacks STX emissions replicate Bitcoin\u2019s halving cycle. Stacks block rewards are synchronized with Bitcoin halvings and cut in half roughly every four years.\n\nStacks History\n\nOriginally named Blockstack, the company was founded in 2013 by Ryan Shea and Muneeb Ali with the vision of solving pain points in web applications. Coming out of Princeton University, the startup was approved through the Y Combinator accelerator in 2014.\n\nIn 2019, Blockstack became the first company ever to receive approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell digital assets. The SEC-regulated token offering raised over $23 million.\n\nFollowing a full rebrand to Stacks in October 2020, the company published a new white paper outlining its plans for Stacks 2.0, the Bitcoin-adjacent execution layer we use today.\n\nThe Stacks Ecosystem\n\nThe Stacks ecosystem is home to a range of decentralized applications, wallet software, and NFT collections. While the Stacks network is still relatively young, the Stacks Foundation offers plenty of grants and funds incentivizing developers to join the ecosystem.\n\nStacks DeFi\n\nDecentralized exchanges and lending platforms are typically the cornerstone DeFi apps on emerging blockchains. Apps like StackSwap, Alex, and Zest Protocol are basic DeFi providers within the Stacks network.\n\nSource: StackSwap\n\nThe Arkadiko Protocol creates the leading stablecoin, USDA, on Stacks. Like Tether (USDT), USDA is pegged to the value of the U.S. Dollar.\n\nStacks NFTs\n\nBitcoin NFTs continue to gain traction in the Web3 world. While Ordinals have been the main driving force behind Bitcoin NFTs, the Stacks NFT ecosystem has been witnessing its own renaissance.\n\nGamma.io has established itself as the leading NFT marketplace for Bitcoin Ordinals and Stacks NFTs. Megapont Ape Club is the most well-known NFT collection on the Stacks network, generating over five million STX in trading volume.\n\nStacks Wallets\n\nHiro Wallet is undoubtedly the most widely used and trusted Stacks Wallet. With over 280,000 downloads, it tracks the value of your account in real-time and is the best place to store Ordinals and Stacks NFTs.\n\nUsers can also participate in the Proof-of-Exchange consensus and \u2018stack\u2019 STX coins to earn BTC rewards. The Hiro Wallet is available as both a desktop app and a browser extension.\n\nStacks Pros and Cons\n\nNow that we have a better understanding of the Stacks protocol and how it works, let\u2019s briefly recap its benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros\n\nScalable \u2013 The Stacks network addresses one of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest faults: scalability. By breaking down blocks into micro blocks, Stacks can reach high transaction throughput and significantly reduce transaction fees when compared to the native Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\u2013 The Stacks network addresses one of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest faults: scalability.

Secure Native Programming Language \u2013 Clarity is designed to solve the pitfalls and common exploits of other smart contract languages. While this doesn\u2019t guarantee that every contract on Stacks is watertight, it leaves less room for error and offers increased user security.\n\nCons\n\nLow user count \u2013 Despite the innovation on display and the creativity of the PoX consensus, the Stacks network has struggled to attract high user numbers and TVL (total value locked). According to DefiLlama, the Stacks network has amassed less TVL than other small networks like Hedera Hashgraph, despite targeting the biggest source of liquidity in the space.\n\n\u2013 Despite the innovation on display and the creativity of the PoX consensus, the Stacks network has struggled to attract high user numbers and TVL (total value locked).

Small ecosystem \u2013 The range of applications available within the Stacks ecosystem pales compared to other blockchains. Coins with similar market caps, like Fantom, have almost ten times the number of dApps while similarly valued to STX.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe issues facing the Stacks network are, at face value, easily solvable. Generous incentive programs and grants are already in place to kickstart the growth and development of the blockchain.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nBitcoin is the face of the cryptocurrency industry, and its lack of utility is a poor reflection of the incredible progress being made in other realms of blockchain technology. By bringing new utility to BTC, the Stacks network is a net positive for the entire blockchain industry.\n\nFAQs"

        "title": "Bitcoin's chart has some eerie parallels to gold in the 1970s - CNBC",
        "content": "Many investors have dismissed the notion that bitcoin could be a type of digital gold since the cryptocurrency has been trading like a speculative risk asset for much of the past two years. But about 50 years ago, gold did the same thing, Morgan Stanley said in a recent note. If bitcoin's current moves continue to follow those of gold in the 1970s, the cryptocurrency could be in for some tough times ahead. In 1971, individuals could no longer convert U.S. dollars to a specified amount of gold. Since 2008, governments have become more reliant on central banks creating new fiat currency \u2014 money that isn't backed by a commodity \u2014 to provide support in times of crisis, according to Morgan Stanley's note. That's different from bitcoin, which has a limited supply. In the '70s, \"gold was tracking the rising rate of consumer price inflation (CPI), which was largely a result of the recent explosion of fiat money supply,\" said Sheena Shah, a strategist at Morgan Stanley and a coauthor of the note. \"Bitcoin, on a logarithmic scale, has so far followed a similar path to the price speculation of gold in the 1970s, which also seemed to follow a four year cycle.\" Starting in 1971, gold prices quadrupled within four years as the U.S. dollar money supply grew rapidly, the strategist said. \"That wasn't the height of the speculation, however: from August 1976 to January 1980, the price of gold rose eightfold from $102 to $850.\" \"As the gold price was still managed for the first few years, the similarities may be a statistical coincidence \u2026 more likely, in our view, is that both were driven by similar speculation cycles,\" she added. Bitcoin fans have long highlighted its potential to act as a \"digital gold\" because it's divisible, scarce and doesn't rely on a central issuer. They also once argued that bitcoin offered a hedge against equities, but last year's market havoc threw cold water on that idea as the cryptocurrency's correlation with stocks hit an all-time high . At the end of March, that correlation fell to its lowest since 2021 , while bitcoin's correlation with gold has been climbing. After the Federal Reserve loosened monetary policy to support the economy at the start of the Covid pandemic, bitcoin outperformed gold 2.9x over the three-and-a-half-year period, Bernstein recently noted. This year, banking crisis fears in the U.S. helped push bitcoin to even greater gains. \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom and Gabriel Cortes contributed reporting"

The numbers if visibly higher from February's results, when HIVE mined 250 BTC.\n\nHIVE Blockchain Mines More Bitcoins in March 2023\n\nThe increase in production took place despite the appreciation of the difficulty of mining cryptocurrencies. The Bitcoin network difficulty increased to 46.8 trillion during March, reaching an all-time high. Accordingly, Bitcoin mining difficulty ended the month about 9% higher than at the beginning of the month.\n\nThe company's current BTC balance is approximately 2,310, and it produced an average of 9.1 BTC per day last month. The company has received over 5,600 BuzzMiners in its data centers, all of which are functioning.

        "content": "Glassnode\u2019s latest analysis suggests that Bitcoin has built a strong foundation below the $30,000 level, and the current supply structure shows similarities to early 2016 and early 2019.\n\nThe report shows that the Long-Term Holder (LTH) supply is just shy of a new all-time high, with a total supply balance of 14.161 million Bitcoin (BTC). In contrast, short-term holders (STH), who acquired coins after FTX failed, have seen their supply balance of 2.914 million BTC remain relatively constant in 2023.\n\nLong-term holders are unfazed despite major downturns\n\nBy April 12, 155 days had passed since the FTX exchange collapsed on Nov. 8, 2022. The 155-day mark is crucial because it is the minimum length of time that a Bitcoin holder must have held their coins to be classified as a long-term holder (LTH).\n\nThus, the supply distribution can be divided into two halves, first, before FTX\u2019s collapse to represent LTH supply, and the other after, to represent short-term holders.\n\nBitcoin Long/Short-Term Holder Supply.

It noted that Bitcoin is currently experiencing a period of \u201cPlateau of Patience,\u201d where LTH supply tends to hover around its ATH, often from several months to over a year.\n\nIt added that the supply structure also has similarities to early 2016 and early 2019.

The cryptocurrency is enjoying a strong rally in 2023. Bitcoin prices rose from $16,600 in December 2022 to over $28,000 in March 2023.\n\nFinancial crises like the FTX exchange and Signature Bank collapses, have wounded some cryptocurrencies and stocks. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is only growing stronger. Some say Bitcoin may even surpass the $66,790 price tag it earned in 2021 soon. We\u2019ll explore why experts are so bullish on Bitcoin, and how you can prepare for a new all-time high.\n\nBitcoin's all-time high: is it coming in 2023?\n\nSeveral experts predict that 2023 is the year Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high price. Bitcoin experienced a lot of volatility in the past two years - in November of 2021, its price tag was over USD 66,000. In 2022, the cryptocurrency suffered a -34.72% overall price drop, reaching its lowest price yet.\n\nCryptocurrency suffered due to geopolitical and economic instability in 2022. It also faces opposition from governments across the world.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is outspoken in its criticism of crypto, citing its lack of regulation and potentially fraudulent uses.\n\nChina has gone so far as to ban crypto.\n\nOther countries like South Korea are developing stricter policies around foreign crypto exchanges.\n\nDespite this, insiders and crypto experts have positive sentiments about the future of Bitcoin.\n\nThe resilient digital currency has numerous benefits that give users more value than other assets. Its decentralized and anonymous nature allows for\n\nSecure,\n\nfast, and\n\ntransparent transactions.\n\nChief strategy officer Marshall Beard at popular crypto exchange Gemini thinks Bitcoin will soar. When talking about Bitcoin market trends, Beard said, \u2018\u2019I think Bitcoin probably breaks all-time highs this year\u2019\u2019.

Rand Neuner, the founder of CNBC\u2019s Crypto Banter and CEO of Onchain Capital, is one of them. \u2018\u2019Between now and the end of the year, I see Bitcoin going above $50,000\u2019\u2019.\n\nBitcoin forecast: why are people giving a bullish Bitcoin prediction?\n\nMany worried that the recent banking crisis would severely impact Bitcoin. Instead, Bitcoin has surpassed all expectations and rallied, rising 70% in recent weeks. This is the first time the cryptocurrency topped $28,000 in the past nine months. The 2023 banking crisis is ongoing, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March - making it the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history.\n\nSuggested reading: YouHodler\u2019s Thoughts on the Banking Crisis\n\nCitizens\u2019 confidence in U.S. banks plummeted, and capital flowed into Bitcoin instead. Cryptocurrency operates as a more secure alternative to protecting money. Governments or malicious parties are also unable to tamper with it.\n\nCrypto insiders pointed out this is Bitcoin\u2019s purpose as a decentralised digital currency, and new investors are discovering its appeal. This is great news for the future of Bitcoin\u2019s reputation - proving that users can count on it even during a crisis.\n\nWhat the experts say\n\nCrypto enthusiasts and experts alike are giving Bitcoin a bullish prediction due to several signs. Other than its exceptional performance this year, the crypto is showing signs of rising further. The gaining price has paused slightly since March\u2019s huge uptrend. Still, a hidden MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) price divergence suggests a long-term bullish market.\n\nThe MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator, which reveals the momentum and strength of crypto.\n\nA bullish MACD divergence occurs when the indicator\u2019s two rising lows match the price\u2019s two falling lows.\n\nA green MACD correctly predicted Bitcoin\u2019s upsurges five times in the past. It suggests that the overall crypto market cap may increase, positively impacting Bitcoin.\n\n\u200d\n\nAnother bullish sign is Bitcoin\u2019s dominance levels, which are now at 47%. This is the highest Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has been since June 2022, and it\u2019s still rising. Even as other coins fall, such as Litecoin and Cardano, Bitcoin gets stronger.\n\n\u200d\n\nExperts think that Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving event in 2024 is also contributing to its bullish trend. The last halving occurred in 2020, with three halvings total since Bitcoin\u2019s inception. There has always been a parabolic uptrend in price post-halving.\n\nWhen will Bitcoin rise again?\n\nInsiders agree that 2023 is the year for Bitcoin, and the year\u2019s first few months have proved so. Bitcoin is already on the rise from its lows last year in every way. Bitcoin\u2019s price, market sentiments, and market cap are more desirable now and still rising. Time will only tell how far Bitcoin\u2019s bullish price increase will go. Long-term investors are convinced it will perform stronger than last year, and market sentiments are growing more positive.\n\nBitcoin prediction: Final thoughts\n\nBitcoin\u2019s potential as a store of value and as a tradable digital asset is undeniable. The crypto rally after this year\u2019s banking crisis is a great signal of things to come. However, Bitcoin\u2019s low liquidity raises concerns for some. It makes the crypto more prone to volatility. If large amounts of Bitcoin are traded at once, its value is affected.\n\nDue to this, traders should take risk management measures to invest in crypto safely. Keep a diversified portfolio to hedge your investments against inflation and reduce volatility. Traders can also use stop-loss and take-profit orders to keep their assets safe remotely.\n\nDisclaimer: \u201cThe content should not be construed as investment advice and does not constitute an offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 9.87% in the week through April 14 to trade at US$30,688 at 9:15 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether rose 13.16% in the same period to US$2,100.\n\nIt\u2019s been an eventful week for crypto and the global economy.\n\nBitcoin broke US$30,000 for the first time since June 2022, days after the blockchain surpassed 1 million Ordinals inscriptions, generating over US$4.8 million in fees for the network. Ordinals are likened to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Bitcoin and allow users to mint images, videos, text and even video games.\n\nInvestor sentiment ticked up after Ethereum completed the Shanghai upgrade on Wednesday, enabling staking withdrawals for the first time. Ether broke through the US$2,000 ceiling for the first time since August last year, snuffing out initial concerns that Ether withdrawals would add selling pressure on the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nEven if Ether are unstaked, it does not necessarily mean that people are going to sell, because they could also use it for other DeFi investments, Chen Zhuling, co-founder and CEO of crypto staking platform RockX, said in an interview on Thursday.\n\nOn economy readings, the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) released on Wednesday showed a cooler-than-expected inflation gain of 5% in March on year, the smallest increase since May 2021.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index released on Wednesday showed cooler-than-expected numbers and the smallest increase since May 2021. Image: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. equities rallied Thursday on softer readings in the U.S. producer price index and jobless claims, adding to optimism the Federal Reserve could soon end its year-long cycle of raising interest rates to curb inflation.\n\nThe seeming slowdown in inflation could encourage investors and hedge funds to buy Bitcoin, said Marat Minkin, co-founder of decentralized finance payment app TONBanking.\n\nLower inflation usually encourages investors to take a more aggressive risk stance for assets like Bitcoin, said Minkin in emailed comments.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve. Image: Getty Images\n\nJohn Isige, an analyst at crypto trading platform Vauld, said that Bitcoin\u2019s gains this year show it is maturing as an asset class and that it offers a hedge against economic uncertainty.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBitcoin is definitely at the start of a bull run. Volumes are still low but holding US$30,000 could keep small retail traders streaming into the market,\u201d Isige said in a LinkedIn response to Forkast. The latest CPI data shows inflation is easing in the U.S. and that is encouraging, he said.\n\nHowever, Brian Santos, the founder of the non-profit Bitcoin Business Alliance said the token remains in bearish territory and he expects a price correction if Bitcoin does not break out well above US$30,000.\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, agreed that Bitcoin could still be in a bear market due to thin volume.\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.28 trillion on Friday at 9:15 p.m. in Hong Kong, up from US$1.18 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$594 billion market cap accounted for 46.4% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$252 billion accounted for 19.7%.\n\nSee related article: Crypto firms hardpressed to find U.S. bank partners as industry blames \u2018Operation Choke Point 2.0\u2019\n\nBiggest gainers: RNDR and WOO\n\nThe Render Network\u2019s token (RNDR) was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap, rallying 24.83% to US$1.61. The token started gaining momentum on April 9, three days after the network announced the community approval of its migration to Solana.\n\nThe Render Network allows idle GPUs (graphics processing units) to be used for the digital rendering needed in fields like 3D modeling, gaming imagery, and virtual reality.\n\nThe WOO coin, the utility token of crypto trading platform Woo Network, was this week\u2019s second biggest gainer with a rise of 23.14% to trade at US$0.25. The token started its rally on April 10, days after crypto exchange Kraken announced the launch of WOO perpetual contracts.\n\nNext week: Market eyes US$32,000 Bitcoin price\n\n\u201cAll eyes are on US$32,000, a resistance that may determine the beginning of a bull run. A break above this brings US$38,000 within a reachable scope,\u201d wrote Isige.\n\nBut Ikrom Ergashev, co-founder of blockchain investment analytics firm Neironix, expects Bitcoin to move sideways next week at US$29,000-32,000, he said in emailed comments.\n\nSee related article: Ethereum stands firm as Shapella upgrade rolls out"

With a retracement now in effect, attention will be on whether those altcoins can hold at their own higher levels.\n\nUnder the hood, it appears to be business as usual for Bitcoin, with network fundamentals already at or near all-time highs, showing no definitive signs of a comedown this week.\n\nIt may be too early to determine how price performance will impact hodlers, but the temptation to sell at 10-month highs must be clear, with the percentage of the overall BTC supply now in profit at an impressive 75%.\n\nCointelegraph takes a look at these factors and more in the weekly rundown of potential Bitcoin price triggers.\n\nBTC price: $30,000 hangs in the balance\n\nAfter a \u201cboring\u201d weekend for BTC price action, volatility returned in classic style at the April 16 weekly close.\n\nWith it came a return to $30,000 for BTC/USD, marking its first major support retest since hitting 10-month highs above $31,000 last week.\n\nTraders and analysts had widely predicted the move, arguing that it would constitute a healthy retracement to prepare for the continuation of the uptrend.\n\nRe-bought everything that I took profit on.\n\n\n\nI'll reduce below $29.7K BTC and $2K on ETH.\n\n\n\nWorst case scenario, I make a little less money on the overall positions.

While developments have been technically bullish since the October lows markets are near these key resistance points with the $VIX on the floor of its multi year uptrend,\u201d Henrich continued.\n\n\u201cWill recent liquidity injections, which have contributed to suppressed volatility, be enough to sustain a move above resistance as the economy is approaching a recession per the Fed staff?

        "content": "A Georgia man who stole more than 50,000 Bitcoin from the Silk Road drug-trafficking site before his cache hit $3.35 billion in value was ordered to serve a year and a day in prison.\n\nJames Zhong, 32, was sentenced Friday in New York federal court, where he pleaded guilty to wire fraud last year. At the time of the heist in 2012, the Bitcoin was worth $620,000. When authorities seized devices holding the stolen Bitcoin in November 2021, its value had exploded, making it the second-largest financial seizure in US history.\n\nBefore he was caught, Zhong spent $16 million of the proceeds on real estate investments, luxury hotels, nightclubs and Lamborghinis, prosecutors said. The value of the Bitcoin seized is now about $1.56 billion.\n\nUS District Judge Paul Gardephe cited the \u201chighly sophisticated nature of the crime\u201d and Zhong's active concealment of the stolen Bitcoin for nine years until agents raided his house. Zhong faced between 27 and 33 months in prison under advisory guidelines, but Gardephe said he was granting leniency because of the \u201ctruly unique circumstances\u201d in the case. Still, the judge said he also wanted to deter other criminals.\n\n\u201cWhile the victim in this case happened to be a criminal enterprise, the victim tomorrow could be a legitimate business,\u201d Gardephe said.\n\nProsecutors told the judge that Zhong should get prison because he covered up his theft for nearly a decade, moving the Bitcoin through so-called mixers that make it harder to trace transactions by jumbling tokens together. But they also said he should get less than two years in prison, citing his youth, his autism and his help in recovering the stolen crypto.\n\nSolace in Computer\n\nZhong's lawyers asked the judge to spare him a prison term, saying he came from a dysfunctional family and received no love from his divorced parents, who were Chinese immigrants. He was \u201cseverely bullied and victimized by his peers because he was different \u2014 he was extremely shy, overweight, and most significantly, suffered from undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder,\u201d Zhong's lawyers said in court papers. \u201cHaving no friends or family he could turn to, Jimmy found solace and friendship in the world of his computer.\u201d\n\nIn court, Zhong expressed \u201cshame and remorse,\u201d and told the judge, \u201cI always knew what I did was wrong.\u201d\n\nHe said he hid his crimes as Bitcoin soared in value.\n\n\u201cI think I buried my head in the sand,\u201d Zhong said. \u201cIt made me feel important and worth something.\u201d\n\nZhong said that while some college friends have stuck by him, the one who's been most supportive is his dog Chad, who is old and sick.\n\nIn their sentencing memo, Zhong's lawyers argued that while he had no right to the stolen Bitcoin, neither did Silk Road. They said the marketplace isn't a victim \u201cin the true sense of the word\u201d under the law, noting that Silk Road's imprisoned founder, Ross Ulbricht, contacted Zhong and asked him how he took the cryptocurrency. But he never asked for it back \u2014 and sent more.\n\nAfter pleading guilty, Zhong agreed to forfeit $42.7 million as well as additional Bitcoin and property.\n\nThe heist began after Zhong had stored some Bitcoin on Silk Road, the online black market. When he double-clicked the withdrawal button by mistake, he got back twice as much as he put in. Over several days, he deposited more tokens and quickly withdrew them, double-clicking each time. Exploiting that glitch led him to more than 50,000 Bitcoin, each worth about $12 at the time.\n\nFederal agents seized 50,491 Bitcoin from Zhong's lakefront home in Gainesville, Georgia, along with $661,900 in cash and gold and silver bars. Zhong stored the crypto on devices in a safe under floorboards and on a single-board computer stowed in a Cheetos popcorn tin in a closet. He later surrendered more than 1,000 additional Bitcoin.\n\nZhong attended the University of Georgia from 2008 to 2014, earning a bachelor's degree in computer science and mining Bitcoin. He also drank excessively and used cocaine, according to a psychiatric examination report in his court file.\n\nHe converted some Bitcoin to $700,000 in cash, so he would have a \u201ccase full of money like in the movies,\u201d the report said. \u201cHe hoped the visual appeal of the cash would impress a female into having sexual relations with him,\u201d the report said. \u201cHe stated his plan did not work.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Zhong reported a burglary at his home his Athens, Georgia, saying someone had stolen a silver brief case with $400,000 in cash."

In today\u2019s Finshots, we tell you the story of how authorities tracked down someone who stole Bitcoins many many years ago.\n\nThe Story\n\nIn 2013, Bitcoin had one promise \u2014 anonymity.\n\nIf you wanted to sell drugs. You could hop onto the dark web and find a buyer. You\u2019d ask them to send the Bitcoins to your wallet. And no one would know who you were. It was like dealing in cash without leaving a trace. And since there were no wads of cash to lug around, it was easy peasy. No one would know what you\u2019d even bought.\n\nAnd law enforcement had no answers. It was all very new to everyone. Bitcoins and blockchain were exotic words that would cause a headache. So dubious individuals took advantage of this relative anonymity. Drug deals happened\n\nBut it looks like they had a little too much faith in the promise of bitcoin. Just ask James Zhong who was sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in prison on Friday.\n\nNearly a decade ago, Zhong was a 22-year-old college student who wanted to buy some drugs. Cocaine to be specific. So he decided to try out this infamous online marketplace called the Silk Road that everyone was talking about. And since it was a platform for all sorts of nefarious activities, Silk Road only dealt with Bitcoin. You know, for the privilege of promised anonymity.\n\nBut while Zhong ventured into the website for drugs, he found a bug instead. A coding error. He tried to withdraw some Bitcoins from his Silk Road account and he inadvertently double-clicked the \u2018withdraw\u2019 button. Silk Road glitched and processed the transaction twice. Even though he didn\u2019t have that many Bitcoins in the account in the first place.\n\nZhong found that he could simply steal Bitcoins directly from Silk Road\u2019s wallet. And as per US Law Enforcement, once Zhong realized what was happening, he quickly created 9 different accounts on Silk Road. All for the purpose of exploiting this bug. He went on a double-clicking spree and managed to get hold of 50,000 Bitcoins. Which is worth a whopping $1.5 billion in today\u2019s value by the way.\n\nNow, Silk Road was shut down in 2013. The US authorities went after the founder for abetting illegal activities. But no one knew Zhong. Even though the Silk Road computers that were seized had all the records. People knew that Bitcoin had been stolen. But nothing revealed Zhong\u2019s identity. And for 8 years, he kept moving money from one account to another.\n\nAnd he could spend the money willy-nilly too. He spent $16 million hosting parties on chartered planes and boats. Took people to sporting events and hotels. He was living the high life. Oh, he even bought himself a Lamborghini.\n\nSo, how was Zhong trapped in the end?\n\nA classic slip-up. Zhong transferred some of his ill-gotten Bitcoins to another account where he held legitimate funds.\n\nBut wait\u2026how did authorities know that Zhong had actually stolen those Bitcoins in the first place?\n\nAh, that\u2019s the part about anonymity. See, there are a couple of things that people like Zhong forget.\n\nFirstly, there are some very smart people in the world who like to solve really hard problems. And one of those problems was about how to crack the anonymity of Bitcoins. There was no precedent. No course they could watch on YouTube. They just had to figure it out on their own.\n\nTake researcher, Sarah Meiklejohn for instance. In 2013, she was one of the first people in the world to go down a rabbit hole to figure out if the blockchain was really anonymous. She got a massive data dump and started to work. She wanted to find patterns. She figured out ways to cluster these addresses for transactions.\n\nShe went undercover. Got involved in a few illegal transactions on Silk Road too. And then, when she had to make a Bitcoin transfer, she\u2019d know the address of the person she interacted with. She\u2019d go back, look at her dump of data and find it within a cluster. Voila!\n\nAfter this, it was just about following the money trail. Watch it move from one address to another.\n\nAnd then, wait for the owners to cash out their Bitcoins. Because at some point, they can\u2019t simply keep dealing in Bitcons. They need to convert it into hard cash. Into dollars. And they typically need a crypto exchange to do the deed. Now, since exchanges take a lot of Know Your Customer (KYC) information these days, once you have a solid money trail linked to a suspect Bitcoin deal, you simply pounce when they cash out.\n\nIn fact, tracking Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies used in nefarious activities is such a booming business now that one of the largest in the space is a company called Chainalysis that\u2019s valued at a whopping $8.6 billion. Law enforcement is in love with them too.\n\nAnd finally, people forget that the blockchain is forever. Those transactions from 2013? That\u2019ll be available for the public to see for eternity. So if anything even smells a little bit funny, the cops can simply go back in time and track down all these dubious transactions.\n\nIt\u2019s not like cash at all. Oops.\n\nAnyway, with Zhong, once law enforcement knew that there was a link between the Silk Road bitcoins and this separate wallet, they simply asked the Bitcoin exchange for the IP address. They tracked it down. And knocked down the door to find his loot all stashed away inside digital devices. Even in a tin of popcorn!\n\nSo is the promise of cryptocurrency anonymity over then?\n\nWell, clearly it\u2019s not as robust as people originally believed. Bitcoin is part of a much larger ecosystem with multiple intermediaries who all have flaws in them. So perhaps true anonymity will always remain a distant dream.\n\nBut there are others slowly trying to tighten the screws. For instance, there\u2019s a cryptocurrency called monero that argues it\u2019s more private than Bitcoin. And the new hot thing is another currency called zcash which claims it uses advanced tech to make sure that detecting ownership is nearly impossible.\n\nSee, this is like a cat-and-mouse game. Regulators devise ingenious ways to break anonymity and track users. And then someone creates another crypto that\u2019s one step ahead of the tracking tech. The cycle will continue\n\nBut here\u2019s a warning to anyone thinking of using monero or zcash for illicit gains. Remember \u2014 nothing is private forever. Today it might be. Tomorrow it might not be. And when the authorities go digging into the past. You\u2019ll likely be found out.\n\nUntil then\u2026\n\nDon't forget to share this article on WhatsApp, LinkedIn and Twitter\n\nDitto Insights: Why Millennials should buy a term plan\n\nAccording to a survey, only 17% of Indian millennials (25\u201335 yrs) have bought term insurance. The actual numbers are likely even lower.\n\nAnd the more worrying fact is that 55% hadn\u2019t even heard of term insurance!\n\nSo why is this happening?\n\nOne common misconception is the dependent conundrum. Most millennials we spoke to want to buy a term policy because they want to cover their spouse and kids. And this makes perfect sense. After all, in your absence you want your term policy to pay out a large sum of money to cover your family\u2019s needs for the future. But these very same people don\u2019t think of their parents as dependents even though they support them extensively. I remember the moment it hit me. I routinely send money back home, but I had never considered my parents as my dependents. And when a colleague spoke about his experience, I immediately put two and two together. They were dependent on my income and my absence would most certainly affect them financially. So a term plan was a no-brainer for me.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason why millennials should probably consider looking at a term plan \u2014 Debt. Most people we spoke to have home loans, education loans and other personal loans with a considerable interest burden. In their absence, this burden would shift to their dependents. It\u2019s not something most people think of, but it happens all the time.\n\nFinally, you actually get a pretty good bargain on term insurance prices when you\u2019re younger. The idea is to pay a nominal sum every year (something that won\u2019t burn your pocket) to protect your dependents in the event of your untimely demise. And this fee is lowest when you\u2019re young.\n\nSo if you\u2019re a millennial and you\u2019re reading this, maybe you should reconsider buying a term plan.

        "title": "Bitcoin Takes A Dive Below $30,000, What\u2019s Next For BTC? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has failed again to remain above its critical psychological level at $30,000, and it\u2019s currently trading at $29,500. As of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency in the market seems poised to revisit lower levels to regain its bullish momentum. Most altcoins are reaching new highs and gaining dominance.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Hits Range Highs\n\nDaan Crypto, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, recently commented on the relationship between Bitcoin\u2019s price and its dominance in the cryptocurrency market. According to Daan, when Bitcoin dominance hits the top of its range, it often precedes a move down to the bottom of the range.\n\nTo illustrate this point, Daan marked out three previous periods where BTC.D hit (near) the top of the range and moved down to the bottom. The range that Daan marked out sits at approximately 39-49%.\n\nDuring the first move down on BTC.D in the summer of 2021, Bitcoin\u2019s price remained flat with a slight upward trend. However, during the second move down on BTC.D from October 2021 to January 2022, Bitcoin\u2019s price experienced a significant correction, dropping from the $60K region to the $40K region.\n\nThe third move down on BTC.D in the summer of 2022 saw Bitcoin\u2019s price drop from approximately $30K to $20K. We are again witnessing a rejection from the Bitcoin dominance range highs, which could signal a potential move down to the bottom of the range.\n\nAs reported by NewsBTC, Bitcoin has a near-term support level of $29,500. This level was previously a strong resistance but has now flipped to become an essential support for Bitcoin. If the cryptocurrency experiences a further decline, the $28,600 level is expected to serve as another key support floor.\n\nRed Months For BTC Incoming?\n\nOnchain Edge, a crypto analyst, recently examined the historical price performance of Bitcoin during May and June over the past 10 years. The analysis revealed five red and five green months in May, indicating a 50% chance of either outcome.\n\nFurthermore, there has only been one other year, 2013, where Bitcoin had four green months in a row, suggesting that predicting the May price trend is challenging. However, the analysis also looked at the performance of Bitcoin in June, where the trend continuation was observed in seven out of ten months.\n\nIf May was red, then June was also red, and if May was green, then June was also green. This trend indicates that June\u2019s price performance highly depends on May\u2019s performance.\n\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin has experienced a decline of over 3% in the last 24 hours. If Bitcoin\u2019s dominance coincides with a potential red month of May, then bulls may face a challenging ride ahead. However, it is worth noting that the tides of the crypto winter seem to be fully in order, indicating that bulls may need to exercise patience.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Is Bitcoin Halal or Haram? A Shariah Analysis - DailyForex.com",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have unique features that make them unlike any other asset class, such as Forex or equities. For this reason, cryptocurrencies pose unique challenges to how Islamic scholars interpret Islamic (Shariah) laws to recommend whether trading or owning cryptocurrencies is halal (permissible) or haram (forbidden).\n\nThis article explores that debate. To be clear, it is a debate\u2014unlike interest payments, or the consumption of alcohol, Islamic scholars and the Muslim community have not reached a consensus on whether cryptocurrencies should be considered Halal or Haram, and they maybe never will because of subjective interpretations of cryptocurrencies\u2019 role in modern economies.\n\nTo help us lay the foundation for understanding the debate, let\u2019s start by learning some of the essential attributes of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow Does Cryptocurrency Work?\n\nHere are five key things to know about how Cryptocurrencies work.\n\nUnlike traditional currencies such as Euros or US Dollars, neither governments nor central banks issue cryptocurrencies. Instead, independent groups can create a cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency stored on a technology called blockchain. In other words, the blockchain comes first, and a cryptocurrency sits on it. Blockchain technology is a decentralized record-keeping system. Unlike conventional record-keeping methods, such as financial records kept by accountants, a blockchain uses a computer network to make new entries visible to everyone. That means there is no central authority controlling a single ledger. Instead, everyone that is a part of the system controls a decentralized and shared record. Researchers invented the concept of blockchain to enable the creation of Bitcoin. Because blockchain technology is technically independent of cryptocurrencies, industries now use decentralized blockchain record-keeping systems for other reasons\u2014for example, manufacturers use it for supply chain management, and governments have started experimenting with blockchain for health records. The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, launched in 2009. Today, Bitcoin is still the largest cryptocurrency, followed by Ethereum. In the case of Bitcoin, anyone can potentially create a new Bitcoin by solving a complex mathematical or cryptographic problem\u2014this process is known as \u201cmining.\u201d Bitcoin mining uses tremendous computing power and energy to the point that mining is environmentally damaging. Because of the mathematical structure of Bitcoin, there is a maximum number of Bitcoin that can exist in the future.\n\nCryptocurrency is unregulated (mostly).\n\nBy their very nature, cryptocurrencies are not backed by real assets, governments, or central banks. Anyone can create a cryptocurrency and sell coins to the public with the right technology and team.\n\nAs you can imagine, when cryptocurrencies first appeared in the early 2010s, the industry was like the wild west, much like Forex was in the early 2000s. Slowly but surely, jurisdictions like the US and Europe have started to regulate aspects of cryptocurrencies. However, there is a long way to go\u2014they are not regulated in the same way as traditional currencies. From that perspective, the public should be cautious and not assume they will receive the same protections with cryptocurrencies as regulated banks give to cash deposits.\n\nIslamic Finance Principles\n\nTo provide a framework for the debate surrounding whether cryptocurrencies are halal or haram, let\u2019s consider three main Islamic finance principles: Wealth must be generated from legitimate trade and asset-based investment. The use of money to make money is expressly forbidden. Investment should also have a social and ethical benefit to broader society beyond pure return. Risk should be shared.\n\nTo allow Muslims to act within these principles, there are several activities which are prohibited under Shariah law:\n\nCharging and receiving interest (riba). Investing in businesses dealing with alcohol, gambling, drugs, pork, pornography, or other areas that Shariah considers unlawful. Speculation or extreme risk. Uncertainty about the subject matter and terms of contracts\u2014this includes selling something one does not own, e.g., short-selling.\n\nConsidering the above ideas of Shariah law, let\u2019s look at the Shariah-compliant debate around crypto.\n\nWhy Do Some People Consider Crypto Haram?\n\nReason 1: Cryptocurrency is not money.\n\nA defining feature of a currency is that it acts as a medium of exchange or store of wealth. Many Shariah experts believe that in the modern world, only governments or their central banks can issue currencies that meet the defining features of money. Because cryptocurrencies operate outside the realms of governments and the banking system, many Islamic scholars do not view cryptocurrencies as a true currency category. Remember, even though cryptocurrencies can be an \u201calternative investment asset,\u201d that does not make them an \u201calternative medium of exchange,\u201d i.e., the widely accepted definition of money.\n\nReason 2: Cryptocurrencies are only speculative without intrinsic value. Therefore, they are a form of gambling.\n\nCryptocurrencies are solely mathematical constructs sitting on digital networks. Without the tangible backing of a government or central bank, many Islamic scholars argue that cryptocurrencies, by definition, have no intrinsic value. Without intrinsic value, some Islamic scholars view cryptocurrencies as solely speculative instruments with purely hypothetical value. That leads them to reason that trading cryptocurrencies is gambling, which is haram or forbidden under Shariah law.\n\nReason 3: Cryptocurrencies are used for illegal activities.\n\nBecause cryptocurrency allows for direct \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d transactions made via the internet, only two parties are involved in the activity. No banks, governments or intermediaries are necessary. This makes cryptocurrency transactions much more anonymous. It is important to note that cryptocurrency dealings are not one hundred percent anonymous\u2014law enforcement agencies have found ways to track cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nCriminals are drawn to the increased anonymity of cryptocurrencies. As a result, Bitcoin, for example, has a significantly high proportion of illegal use, such as money laundering or drug trafficking. Some market experts even argue that the only reason to want to use cryptocurrencies rather than traditional currencies is for illegal activities.\n\nReason 4: Cryptocurrency is a high-risk investment.\n\nCryptocurrencies have exceptionally high volatility compared to traditional currencies. Let\u2019s compare Bitcoin to the world\u2019s most widely traded Forex pair, EUR/USD. Since the Euro started trading in Jan 1999, EUR/USD has had a range of 0.83 to 1.60. In other words, the Euro\u2019s entire range from its lowest point to its highest point saw it double in value. And this range played out over decades, not months. In comparison, Bitcoin moved from under $10 a coin in mid-2011 to $69,000 at its high in November 2021, over 7,000 times higher! It then lost 75% of its value in only a few months. Imagine the Euro gaining value against the USD 7,000 times over or losing 75% of its value in a few months! European economies trying to import raw materials or export goods would be unable to function. The volatility of Bitcoin prohibits it from working as a regular currency. Bitcoin is also extremely volatile compared to established equity indexes such as the S&P 500. Shariah scholars often cite cryptocurrency\u2019s excessive volatility as another reason they are haram.\n\nReason 5: Cryptocurrency is not regulated.\n\nThe crypto space is generally unregulated, and as such it has attracted some dubious actors who have launched coins or other ancillary crypto services which are either complete or partial scams.\n\nNow let\u2019s examine why some Islamic finance experts consider cryptocurrencies permissible, or halal.\n\nHow Can Cryptocurrencies Be Halal?\n\nReason 1: Contractual certainty.\n\nUnder Shariah law, a contract is valid if a contractual consideration is present, known as \u201cmal.\u201d That means there must be an exchange of something that can be owned, stored, and traded. Cryptos are real digital assets that can be owned and stored electronically in digital wallets. They can be traded on exchanges, which some countries now regulate.\n\nReason 2: Free of interest (riba).\n\nCryptocurrencies do not have a built-in element of interest or riba. Of course, not having interest does not automatically make cryptocurrencies halal\u2014other attributes can make them haram. However, much of the international capital markets revolve around interest payments, and having an asset class without interest is a big plus for Shariah-conscious investors.\n\nReason 3: Volatility is not haram by itself.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies are used to speculate and take excessive risk, some experts state that volatility is not enough of a reason to consider cryptocurrency as haram. Volatility is present in all markets, and excessive risk is often taken because investors do not manage their capital correctly. For example, an equity trader might put too much of their capital into a single stock that does not perform, thereby damaging a large part of their account value. However, that does not make equity investing haram. Investors can put smaller amounts of their capital in a cryptocurrency because of its volatility, thereby not taking excessive risk.\n\nReason 4: Illegal use of cryptocurrencies by others does not make it haram.\n\nCriminals use traditional currencies like US Dollars or Euros for illegal activities. It\u2019s not as if criminal usage of money only started with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009! Similarly, for decades, criminals have used stocks to make trades using insider information. Islamic finance experts that consider cryptocurrencies halal point to the motive of the investor being haram and not the underlying asset itself as haram.\n\nReason 6: Cryptocurrencies are already used as currencies by some.\n\nShariah scholars that support cryptocurrencies as halal argue that the lack of a central authority strengthens their value as currencies. It means no single authority can manipulate the money supply, ensuring market transparency. Furthermore, many are already using cryptocurrencies as mediums of exchange, even if it is not a dominant vehicle. For example, some companies accept cryptocurrencies as payments for goods and services. This already gives cryptocurrencies purchasing power, where buyers and sellers use them to facilitate transactions.\n\nIs Cryptocurrency Halal or Haram?\n\nBoth sides of the debate have supporters qualified to issue fatwas and have put forward intellectually sound arguments. This makes it difficult for ordinary Muslims to decide either way. Cryptocurrencies are new, and as they evolve\u2014for example, more parts of society accept them as payments or governments fully regulate cryptocurrencies, or new types of cryptocurrencies emerge\u2014the debate will also evolve. It is conceivable that muftis will issue new fatwas based on new market conditions in the future.\n\nAt the present time, Shariah-conscious investors must decide individually whether to proceed with cryptocurrencies or not. Of course, not all cryptocurrencies are the same\u2014you may deem some halal and others haram. And the decision may depend on how you wish to use cryptocurrencies. For example, is it for speculation or purchasing goods and services? These factors will affect your decision.\n\nFatwa on Cryptocurrency\u2014Opinions of Shariah Scholars\n\nA fatwa is a legal ruling on a point of Islamic law (Shariah) given by a qualified faqih (Islamic jurist). A jurist that issues fatwas is called a \u201cmufti.\u201d\n\nThe following is not a comprehensive review of fatwas regarding cryptocurrencies\u2014instead, it is a sampling of ideas in the field.\n\nJanuary 2018: Egypt's top Imam, Sheikh Shawki Allam, the grand mufti, endorsed a ban on trading in Bitcoin by declaring it \"forbidden\" by Islam. He said, \u201cBitcoin carries risks of \u201cfraudulence, lack of knowledge, and cheating. Bitcoin is forbidden in Shariah as it causes harm to individuals, groups and institutions. It is used directly to fund terrorists.\u201d February 2021: Mufti Faraz Adam wrote in his book, \u201cIntroduction to Islamic Fintech,\u201d that he regards many cryptocurrencies as digital assets and that cryptocurrencies with a lawful utility can be deemed as property from a Shariah perspective. Later in his career, he states, \u201cBitcoin will be a currency as long as people use and exchange them. A system which is acceptable among people is sufficient to establish a currency in Shariah.\u201d Because there are various types of crypto-assets, Mufti Faraz recommends screening them for Shariah compliance before investing. His screening criteria are: Legitimacy screening\u2014ensure that the specific cryptocurrency is a genuine project, not a scam. Project screening\u2014ensure that the project is Shariah compliant, e.g., does not require interest. Financials screening\u2014ensuring that it meets the financial criteria for Shariah compliance if it is an equity-based token. Token screening\u2014understanding the Shariah compliance of the token. Staking screening\u2014understanding the Shariah compliance of the staking mechanism. September 2022: Abdulkader Hallak, a wealth advisor at Sarwa, a Dubai, UAE-based firm, believes that volatility is an insufficient reason to consider cryptocurrency as haram. He believes the motive of the investor matters more. He says, \u201cIf you\u2019re not using any leverage or CFDs, and you\u2019re not gambling and taking excessive risk, then this draws the line. What is your goal behind investing in crypto? Is it to accumulate your wealth? Are you using crypto as a store of value? Then that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nBottom Line\n\nBoth sides have solid arguments as to whether cryptocurrencies are halal or haram.\n\nThose that deem cryptocurrencies to be haram (forbidden) cite that they have no intrinsic value, are purely speculative, are excessively risky, do not fit the definition of a currency, and are mainly used for illicit purposes. Experts that consider cryptocurrencies to be halal believe that even though they are volatile, that does not make them haram. and that many people already use them as currencies to buy and sell goods. Thus, cryptocurrencies already act as money. They also argue that cryptocurrencies are real digital assets that can be owned and stored and traded, which fits the Shariah definition of \u201cmal\u201d or property.\n\nDifferent Muftis have given divergent fatwas and opinions on cryptocurrencies. The debate is fluid and evolving.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs crypto trading haram?\n\nPure speculation is generally considered Haram.\n\nIs crypto futures trading halal or haram?\n\nCrypto futures trading is generally considered Haram.\n\nCan Muslims invest in crypto?\n\nMany Muftis and Shariah scholars agree that Muslims can invest in crypto if the usage is Halal.\n\nIs crypto trading gambling?\n\nMany Muftis consider pure trading of cryptos as haram because it is speculation.\n\nIs short-term crypto trading halal?\n\nMany Muftis consider short-term trading of Cryptos as Haram because it is speculation."

        "content": "That alleged wrongdoing has drawn a deluge of regulatory scrutiny and high-profile prosecutions in the US.\n\nAmong the most prominent: FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried is awaiting trial on fraud charges; Do Kwon, co-founder of the Terra blockchain, is facing prosecution for his role in that project\u2019s collapse; Binance and its CEO, Changpeng \u201cC.Z.\u201d Zhao, have been sued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a variety of alleged violations; and Coinbase has received notice that the Securities and Exchange Commission intends to sue the company. Binance and Coinbase have denied any wrongdoing; Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThen there is the recent failure of the crypto-friendly banks Silvergate Capital, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank. While often cited as a bullish catalyst for bitcoin, since they revived its origin story as an alternative to untrustworthy banks, the downfall of those lenders also severed key links to the US financial system, helping to make the once-promising future of the crypto industry as uncertain as ever.\n\nMany of the retail investors burned by last year\u2019s plunge in prices appear to be licking their wounds, rather than taking on new risk, because the amount of money involved in decentralised finance projects remains subdued.\n\nWhile the total value of coins locked into DeFi projects is up more than 25 per cent since the beginning of January, at about $US50 billion ($74.6 billion) it is still a fraction of the $US180 billion peak reached in December 2021, according to the DeFiLlama website.\n\nAt the same time, thousands of jobs have been lost in the industry and hiring has not picked back up.

Private funding for crypto start-ups globally fell to $US2.4 billion in the first quarter \u2013 an 80 per cent decline from an all-time high of $US12.3 billion during the same period last year, according to PitchBook.\n\nWait-and-see\n\n\u201cA lot of the industry is still in wait-and-see mode,\u201d said Matteo Dante Perruccio, international president at crypto wealth manager Wave Digital Assets. \u201cThere has been a flight to quality and the beneficiaries are those companies that weren\u2019t hit by the crypto winter.\u201d\n\nAnother way this move higher is different: the eye-popping 83 per cent rally in bitcoin this year has not been matched by newer coins. Ether, which greatly outperformed bitcoin from 2020 and 2021, is up 71 per cent this year. The Bloomberg Galaxy DeFi Index, which tracks the largest decentralised-finance protocols, has recoupled only about one-tenth of last year\u2019s 2000-point drop.\n\n\u201cWe could be seeing a case of seller exhaustion combined with a renewed bullish narrative following the banking crisis, all mixed with generally low liquidity that has helped BTC\u2019s price toward the upside,\u201d said Clara Medalie, director of research at market-data provider Kaiko.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite all of the gloom and uncertainty, progress in the evolution of the industry has continued. Ethereum this week completed what appears to be a successful upgrade to its network. The so-called Shanghai update, which enables investors to withdraw ether coins that they had locked up in exchange for rewards as part of a \u201cproof of stake\u201d system to safeguard the network, could lure billions of dollars into ether \u2013 even after SEC chairman Gary Gensler indicated he believes that token ought to be regulated as a security.\n\nThe price of ether rose back above $US2000 this week for the first time in six months. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s the mania or gusto we saw at $US30k or $US40k, but there is still, behind the scenes, quiet progress,\u201d said Simon Taylor, head of strategy at Sardine, a fraud prevention start-up whose clients include fintech and crypto companies.\n\nThe macro picture has also changed, potentially for the better. A year ago, the Federal Reserve and other central banks were only beginning what would become a series of interest rate rises that reversed a years-long policy of easy money. With the end of that tightening cycle now closer at hand, the conditions may once again be ripe for a crypto boost.\n\nOne big question is how enthusiastic traditional financial institutions will be going forward, and whether they\u2019ll be willing to step in to fill the roles once played by failed crypto start-ups like FTX. There are some indications that could be happening. Nasdaq, for example, expects its custody services for digital assets to launch by the end of the second quarter.\n\nOver the long haul, as much as $US5 trillion may transition into new forms of money, such as central bank digital currencies and stablecoins, by 2030, according to a Citigroup research study. Another $US5 trillion worth of traditional financial assets could be tokenised, helping drive mass adoption of blockchain technologies, according to the report.\n\nEven so, for Michael Purves, CEO of Tallbacken Capital Advisors, the \u201c\u2018show me\u2019 threshold\u201d will be higher this time around for institutional investors, considering the role crypto is meant to play in a portfolio is a moving target. Once touted as a hedge against inflation \u2013 like an internet-age gold \u2013 it instead tumbled during the worst consumer-price surge since the 1980s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInstitutions started to take bitcoin seriously after bitcoin broke $US20,000 in 2020 and played a key role in the subsequent rally to $US69,000,\u201d he wrote in a recent note to clients.\n\n\u201cHowever, this time around, its longer-term history of not providing portfolio diversification will weigh heavily on institutions, which probably have bigger headaches to worry about.\u201d\n\nBloomberg"

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been seeing bullish trends in recent months. However, experts believe that other cryptocurrencies, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and RenQ Finance (RENQ), may be ready for a surge in 2023. In this article, we will explore why experts are bullish on SHIB and RENQ and what factors may contribute to their potential growth.\n\nBTC sees bullish trends\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent surge to a nine-month high is a positive indication that the medium-term bearish trend in the cryptocurrency market is starting to shift. While the daily charts show a bullish trend, there may still be some short-term consolidation to consider.\n\nDuring Q1 of 2023, BTC/USD surpassed the 200-day moving average, the 89-day moving average, and the lower edge of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily charts, signaling the start of an uptrend. The downward correction in March was halted at the 200-day moving average, further supporting the emerging uptrend.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $30,400, after peaking at a 10-month high of $30,540 last week.\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) Overview\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that was launched in August 2020. It was created as a decentralized alternative to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. SHIB has gained popularity due to its low value, which allows investors to buy large quantities of the cryptocurrency at a relatively low price.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ), on the other hand, is a DeFi token that aims to solve the liquidity problem faced by decentralized exchanges. It offers a comprehensive solution that is accessible to all types of traders, from novices to seasoned professionals. Its innovative features, strong community support, and potential for growth make it an attractive option for investors looking to get involved in the DeFi space.\n\nBullish Trends for SHIB and RENQ:\n\nExperts believe that both SHIB and RENQ are poised for a surge in 2023. Here are some of the reasons why:\n\nGrowing Popularity : SHIB has been gaining popularity in the crypto community due to its low value and meme-inspired nature. It has also been listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges, which has increased its exposure and legitimacy in the market. RENQ has also been gaining popularity due to its innovative features and potential to solve the liquidity problem faced by decentralized exchanges.\n\n: SHIB has been gaining popularity in the crypto community due to its low value and meme-inspired nature.

RENQ\u2019s community is also strong and passionate about the project, which has helped to create a positive buzz around the cryptocurrency.\n\n: Both SHIB and RENQ have strong communities backing them.

SHIB\u2019s low value allows for significant capital growth if the cryptocurrency\u2019s value increases, while RENQ\u2019s innovative features and potential to solve the liquidity problem faced by decentralized exchanges make it an attractive investment opportunity for those interested in DeFi.\n\nConclusion\n\nExpert believe that both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) are ready for a surge in 2023. Their growing popularity, strong community support, and potential for growth make them attractive investment opportunities for those interested in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and unpredictable, and investors should always do their own research and exercise caution before investing in any cryptocurrency.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "What Is Bitcoin's Price Trajectory Amid The Banking Crisis? You Can Now Become Your Own Bank With Collateral ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As the world grapples with the Silicon Bank crisis, many turn to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) to safeguard their assets in uncertain times. Amid this, Collateral Network (COLT) is emerging as a new challenger lender in the Web3 space, providing a unique solution for people who want to take out loans on their assets.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBecome Your Own Bank With Collateral Network (COLT)\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) enables users to become their own bank. The platform allows peer-to-peer lending and borrowing without intermediaries like banks or financial institutions. This is achieved through smart contracts, which provide a decentralized environment where borrowers can collateralize their physical assets, which banks tend to avoid.\n\nWith Collateral Network (COLT), users can collateralize items such as vintage cars, gold, fine art, real estate, watches, collectibles, and more. These loans can be used for any purpose, like buying a house or starting a business, giving more control over their finances and eliminating the need for traditional banking services.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) issues an NFT backed by the borrower\u2019s tangible asset on a 1:1 ratio, which is then fractionalized and sold to the COLT community at a predetermined interest rate. This approach allows borrowers to access multiple lenders rather than relying on a single one. Also, this minimizes risk as those who intend to lend their crypto can diversify to multiple backed NFTs.\n\nIn the event of a loan default, Collateral Network (COLT) provides a unique solution. The platform lists the authenticated asset on its private auction, only available to Collateral Network (COLT) token holders. On top of that, Collateral Network (COLT) holders receive numerous benefits, such as lower platform fees, staking incentives, and access to VIP groups.\n\nCollateral Network (COLT) is in its first presale stage, meaning the token is selling at the lowest price it will ever be. Currently, COLT is valued at $0.014, and investors predict it can soon reach $0.35 once the presale is over.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBanking Crisis and Bitcoin\u2019s Price Trajectory: What Can We Expect?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has rallied this past month from $19,955 to over $28,000, despite the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which has caused a domino effect of others going bankrupt. This is mainly due to people wanting to withdraw their funds and banks being unable to provide liquidity. As a result, this has led many to seek out alternative forms of investment and store value, such as Bitcoin (BTC), which has seen a surge in demand after the banking crisis.\n\nHowever, the banking crisis has boosted investors\u2019 confidence, who view digital currency, like Bitcoin (BTC), as an alternative to the traditional banking system. Bitcoin (BTC) has retained its dominance and is on the path to potentially breaking the $30,000 resistance level.\n\nWhile the recent Bitcoin (BTC) rally has been impressive, it\u2019s not uncommon for Bitcoin (BTC) to experience significant price fluctuations in a short period of time. As a result, we may see Bitcoin (BTC) correcting in the near future once the dust has settled after this banking crisis.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "SMALL CAP IDEAS: Where can UK investors find alternative exposure to bitcoin? - This is Money",
        "content": "Those of you with eyes on the markets will know that the best-performing asset class of 2023 has not been equities, real estate, bonds or gold, but bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency borne from the ashes of the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nBitcoin was originally conceived by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto as a decentralised payment network without the need for a third-party financial institution.\n\nWhile bitcoin has failed to cement itself as a genuine cross-border payment network \u2013 primarily due to prohibitive transaction charges and sluggish transaction speeds \u2013 the digital currency has been rebranded by its evangelists as a sort of inflation hedge, an alternative store of value with a finite circulating supply that is impossible to be diluted.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange Group has teamed up with platform Global Futures and Options to bring regulated bitcoin futures and options products to UK investors for the first time ever\n\nSo it comes as no surprise that since the start of 2023, bitcoin's spot price has skyrocketed over 80 per cent, surging past $30,000 earlier this month for the first time in nine months.\n\nFinancial analysts and Twitter handles will continue to lock horns over the credibility of the so-called 'digital gold', but for the investor seeking to diversify their portfolio without the technical hassles of managing crypto wallets and untrustworthy crypto exchanges, what is the best way to gain exposure?\n\nFor physical gold, the answer is easy: The London Stock Exchange is a global hub for small-cap gold exploration and production groups; Shanta Gold, Caledonia Mining, Greatland Gold and Ariana Resources to name a few.\n\nThough far less developed, there is also a burgeoning bitcoin mining segment at the lower end of the London capital markets.\n\nBitcoin miners use long rows of specialised computers to solve complex equations that help the bitcoin network run, receiving newly minted bitcoins in return. This makes start-up costs high, but margins tend to also be high once operations get up and running.\n\nArgo Blockchain (12.75p), saved by the sale of its Texas-based Helios bitcoin-mining facility to Galaxy Digital, is the most established name (its 78 per cent year-to-date performance underscores perfectly how bitcoin miners reflect the market price of bitcoin).\n\nThere is also Quantum Blockchain (1.58p), the AIM-quoted group with an interest in the arcane world of quantum computing.\n\nChief executive and Italian theoretical physicist Francesco Gardin leads a research and development team trying to develop a new way of mining bitcoin using proprietary algorithms to give miners a competitive edge.\n\nBitcoin miners like Argo Blockchain, whose shares have crashed from their pandemic peak as the graph above shows, are as risky as the cryptocurrency underpinning their operations\n\nThese companies are as risky as the cryptocurrency underpinning their operations, though there will soon be another route to bitcoin exposure.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange Group has just teamed up with digital asset derivates platform Global Futures and Options (GFO-X) to bring regulated bitcoin futures and options products to UK investors for the first time ever.\n\nParis-based clearing house LCH, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange Group, will facilitate the transactions via a new, segregated service called DigitalAssetClear.\n\nGFO-X called it 'the first steps to extracting efficiencies from new technologies within a traditional market structure, with the goal over time of delivering 24/7 trading to global regulated digital asset markets'.\n\nDigitalAssetClear will bring bitcoin derivatives products into the regulated market a year after the Financial Conduct Authority prohibited Binance, Coinbase and other trading platforms from offering them.\n\nThe partnership also offers a glimpse of prime minister Rishi Sunak's plans to make the UK a 'global crypto hub'.\n\nAll things considered, the options for UK retail investors seeking alternative exposure to bitcoin prices are objectively limited, albeit growing.\n\nBut if bitcoin prices sustain the rapid momentum we have seen in the latest calendar year, there is a good chance that we'll see more miners, innovators and derivatives platforms coming to the public markets.\n\nLondon could be particularly well-placed to draw IPO interest, if, as is the generally accepted case, bitcoin is treated as a commodity in a similar vein to physical gold rather than a tech-adjacent security.\n\nThe other fundamental question each person must ask themselves is: Should I risk an investment?\n\nThe numerous controversies over the past 12 months, from the dramatic collapses of Three Arrows Capital and FTX to the more recent closures of crypto-focused US banks Signature and Silvergate, have besmirched the reputation of crypto as a respectable asset class, but bitcoin sits apart from the Wild West that is decentralised finance, NFTs and others.\n\nUnlike gold, bitcoin has no intrinsic value and it certainly does not earn a yield in the way a security does, but that has not stopped institutional adoption from ploughing ahead, whether that's commission-free trading offered by Fidelity or BlackRock launching a private bitcoin trust to US clients.\n\nThe message remains as always, do your research , keep your wits sharp and there will be opportunities."
