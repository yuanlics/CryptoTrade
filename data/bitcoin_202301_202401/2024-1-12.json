        "title": "SEC Approves Spot Bitcoin ETFs But Gensler Still Disapproves of Crypto - Mintz",
        "content": "On January 10, 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) approved eleven applications for spot exchange-traded funds (\u201cETFs\u201d) tracking Bitcoin. This landmark moment for the crypto asset industry has been over 10 years in the making. Many retail investors can now add Bitcoin exposure to their existing investment portfolios with the click of a button and just as easily as they purchase shares in an ETF tracking the S&P 500 \u2013 no crypto wallets or exchanges necessary.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of the Bitcoin ETF applications comes on the heels of an August 2023 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that held that the SEC failed to adequately explain why it disallowed the listing and trading of a proposed Bitcoin ETF. The Court\u2019s decision was the culmination of a decade-long battle between the SEC and those applying to launch Bitcoin ETFs, dating back to July 2013, when the first application for a Bitcoin ETF was filed. The SEC denied that application in March 2017, generally concluding that the crypto asset market and regulatory oversight regarding crypto assets were not sufficiently mature. In the face of these early SEC denials, innovators in the crypto asset space continued to explore alternative paths to provide retail investors with access to Bitcoin through various means, including investment trusts, Bitcoin futures products, and spot ETFs in other countries.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of the eleven Bitcoin ETF applications can only be described as reluctant. In Chairman Gensler\u2019s statement immediately following the approvals, he said as much, explaining that \u201cthe Commission disapproved more than 20 exchange rule filings for spot bitcoin ETPs,\u201d and that this round of applications was similar to the previously doomed applications. Gensler acknowledged, however, that the circumstances were different after the Court of Appeals\u2019 August 2023 ruling, such that approving the applications became \u201cthe most sustainable path forward.\u201d This change in circumstances for the Bitcoin ETF applications does not mean, however, that the SEC\u2019s overall view on crypto assets has softened. As Gensler emphasized, \u201c[w]hile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIf any question remained whether the SEC\u2019s approval of the Bitcoin ETF applications might signal that the SEC was softening its stance on crypto, Gensler\u2019s post-approval statement answers that question with an emphatic \u201cno.\u201d Even in announcing the approval of a financial product where the underlying asset is Bitcoin, Gensler warned the public that \u201cinvestors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin\u201d and that Bitcoin is \u201cprimarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing.\u201d\n\nGensler\u2019s statement also suggests that attempts to launch ETFs based on other crypto assets will meet fierce SEC opposition. His statement emphasizes that the SEC\u2019s approval \u201cis cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin\u201d and that the approval \u201cshould in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d\n\nBeyond offering a renewed sense of legitimacy to an industry whose reputation has recently been marred by scandal and unease, the SEC\u2019s approval has the practical effect of allowing more risk-averse retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually holding Bitcoin, itself. Indeed, the new Bitcoin ETFs would operate in much the same way as traditional ETFs, which investors can access through their brokerage accounts and on smartphones with the click of a button. This newfound availability on SEC-regulated financial exchanges means more investors can gain Bitcoin exposure without the hassle of buying the crypto asset itself. That said, some large financial institutions may have reservations about offering Bitcoin ETF access to retail customers from a \u201csuitability\u201d or \u201cbest interest\u201d perspective, and the SEC and other regulators may closely scrutinize the institutions that do.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision on Wednesday in granting approval for Bitcoin ETFs should be seen by crypto enthusiasts and retail investors alike as a major milestone in the push for crypto assets to become more institutionalized, more recognized as an independent asset class, and more widely available to retail investors. Despite the exciting news for investors, the decision should not be interpreted as a sea change in crypto asset regulation \u2013 at least from the SEC\u2019s perspective. It will, however, likely signal an influx of applications to launch ETFs with crypto assets other than Bitcoin (Ethereum or Ripple, for example). The approval of such products will likely face an even longer road to approval than Bitcoin ETFs, given Gensler\u2019s frequent distinction between most crypto assets that he believes are \u201csecurities,\u201d and Bitcoin, which he has characterized as a \u201ccommodity.\u201d\n\nSubscribe To Viewpoints"

It\u2019s been a roller coaster ride, especially in the last few years, and many traders have plunged into bitcoins, with some having made millions, while others have suffered great losses.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering this decentralized version of digital cash, you have a few different ways to buy bitcoins. You can buy them directly or indirectly from a few traditional brokers, as well as some newer upstarts. In fact, it\u2019s easier than ever to buy bitcoins, and you can likely do it at a lower commission than before too, since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024.\n\nHere are five ways to buy bitcoins and some key factors that you need to watch.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is one kind of digital currency or cryptocurrency, a way to pay for things that exists only virtually. The currency debuted in 2009 and really broke into mainstream consciousness in 2017 with its rapid rise that year. Coins are created, or \u201cmined,\u201d when computers that organize the currency process and legitimize transactions in the currency.\n\nBitcoin uses a decentralized network of computers to manage everything \u2014 a distributed ledger called a blockchain that tracks transactions in the currency. It\u2019s like a huge public record of every transaction that has taken place in the currency. And the network monitors everything, ensuring the currency\u2019s integrity and the ownership of bitcoins.\n\n5 ways to buy bitcoins\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to trade Bitcoin, the good news is that you now have several options. You do not even need to open a separate and specialized account to do so, since major brokers offer a way to buy them via ETFs. (Here are some of the top brokers for trading cryptocurrency.) Plus, some unexpected players \u2013 PayPal and Cash App for example \u2013 now allow U.S. residents to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin, too.\n\nEach method below offers a different combination of cost, security and potential upside and downside.\n\nFinancial apps\n\nMany financial apps such as PayPal and Venmo now allow you to trade cryptocurrency.\n\nPayPal makes it tremendously easy to directly buy or sell bitcoins using the same app that you\u2019ve come to trust with your online payments. You\u2019ll pay $0.49 for trades involving less than $5, and the fees rise from there. Trades involving $200.01 \u2013 $1,000 cost 1.8 percent, while those above $1,000 come in at 1.5 percent. There\u2019s a spread markup on trades, but you won\u2019t pay a fee for holding cryptocurrency in your account, and you can trade as little as $1 at a time. Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are also tradable here, as is a newly created PayPal stablecoin.\n\nVenmo charges the same fees, since it\u2019s owned by PayPal.\n\nCrypto exchanges\n\nCrypto exchanges are another popular option for those looking to buy Bitcoin. Exchanges offer a few key advantages to traders. First, the best crypto exchanges offer among the lowest possible all-in costs for trading cryptocurrency. So they\u2019re a good bet if cost is your key objective. Second, many exchanges don\u2019t charge spread mark-ups, which are hidden fees built into the trading prices. Third, many exchanges offer wallets, allowing you to securely store your cryptocurrency.\n\nThe fees at various crypto exchanges can differ markedly, so it\u2019s worthwhile looking around to find which offers the best combination of price, crypto choice and service. Popular options include Binance, Crypto.com and Kraken.\n\nTrading apps\n\nYou can pick up a few bitcoins with no direct commission by using a trading app such as Webull or Robinhood, though you\u2019ll end up making up for it with a spread markup. These apps also allow you to purchase Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nRobinhood takes its best trick \u2013 no commissions \u2013 and applies it to cryptocurrency, but it does charge a spread markup, the exact cost of which it does not reveal. You\u2019ll be able to buy bitcoins directly, and will have access to other digital currencies, too, a feature that other brokers listed here don\u2019t offer. Of course, you\u2019ll be able to buy stocks, ETFs and options while you\u2019re on the easy-to-use platform, including Bitcoin ETFs. Read more on Robinhood.\n\nWebull lets you trade a handful of cryptos, including Bitcoin. You\u2019ll pay a spread markup of 1 percent on each transaction, however. You can also trade stocks, Bitcoin ETFs and options. Read more on Webull.\n\nTraditional brokers\n\nSome traditional brokers have also ventured into the cryptocurrency arena, including Interactive Brokers and TradeStation. And with the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, major brokers offer funds that let you buy the crypto, too.\n\nAt Interactive Brokers you\u2019ll be able to buy futures contracts on Bitcoin as well as trade the coin directly. The broker charges $5 per futures contract, which gives you exposure to five bitcoins. If you want to trade Bitcoin directly, you\u2019ll pay a competitive commission of 0.12-0.18 percent of your trade value, depending on your monthly volume. You\u2019ll also have access to Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Interactive Brokers provides a whole range of other tradable securities, giving you access to securities across the world. Read more on Interactive Brokers.\n\nBitcoin ATMs\n\nAnother option is to buy bitcoins directly through a Bitcoin ATM, though you\u2019re likely to pay much more in commissions than you would elsewhere. You\u2019ll be able to buy bitcoins and some ATMs will allow you to sell them, too, using cash or a debit card. But you may need a Bitcoin wallet to make the transaction. Commissions can be pricey, with some ATMs charging around 7 percent per transaction, while the fees at others may stretch into the teens.\n\nBuying Bitcoin: Here\u2019s what to watch for\n\nAs you\u2019re considering how to buy Bitcoin, you\u2019ll want to evaluate the following factors, since they should influence your choice of where to buy it or whether to ultimately avoid it altogether.\n\nOwnership. What do you want to own exactly? You can own Bitcoin directly (say, through an ETF) or a derivative such as a futures contract, which offers a return on the currency\u2019s movement.\n\nWhat do you want to own exactly? You can own Bitcoin directly (say, through an ETF) or a derivative such as a futures contract, which offers a return on the currency\u2019s movement. Upside/downside. Your potential gain is related directly to whether you own the currency directly or via futures contract. By owning Bitcoin directly, your profit increases by a dollar with every dollar increase in the currency. In contrast, with futures you can gain much more quickly without having to front as much capital. However, your downside is more limited by owning directly, while you can lose more money with futures.\n\nYour potential gain is related directly to whether you own the currency directly or via futures contract.

Futures contracts get you a big piece of the action relatively cheaply, while some brokers may charge you several percent to buy directly. A few percent might not sound like a lot, but if you\u2019re trading in and out of the market, it will quickly eat away at your profits. In contrast, a Bitcoin ETF gets you in the game quickly with no direct commission and a low annual expense ratio, and it\u2019s simpler to trade that way, too.\n\nCommissions can vary widely depending on how you purchase Bitcoin.

In contrast, a Bitcoin ETF gets you in the game quickly with no direct commission and a low annual expense ratio, and it\u2019s simpler to trade that way, too. Security. One of the biggest concerns with any investment is making sure that it\u2019s secure. Some newer cryptocurrency players have had serious problems with security. For example, hackers stole about $570 million worth of Binance\u2019s BNB coin in 2022. More traditional brokers may offer better security because they\u2019ve been dealing with the issue for much longer. And with Bitcoin ETFs, the fund company manages security, making it an easy way to own the cryptocurrency.\n\nYou may also receive bitcoins as part of commercial transactions. Regardless of how you came by your coins, any transaction in the cryptocurrency is reportable to the IRS at tax time.\n\nWhat information is needed to purchase Bitcoin?\n\nWhen you open an account at a traditional brokerage or a crypto exchange, you\u2019ll need to provide basic personal information. Of course, you\u2019ll need to provide your name, but the firm will also require other data such as your Social Security number, your address, your phone number and your bank account number. You may also have to detail how much trading experience you have and how comfortable you are with trading, depending on the institution.\n\nThis information allows the firm to identify you and verify who you are. It\u2019s also vital during tax time when the broker or exchange prepares documents on your gains and losses, reports that you\u2019ll need to accurately file your taxes.\n\nIs Bitcoin an effective hedge against inflation?\n\nSome people think Bitcoin may be an effective way to protect yourself from inflation, or what\u2019s called an inflation hedge. A hedge is a kind of investment that offsets, partially or fully, the price move in another asset. So, an inflation hedge would protect you from inflation in some way.\n\nThere\u2019s little evidence to support the assertion that Bitcoin acts as an inflation hedge, experts say. Bitcoin has not existed long enough to have been through a major inflationary period, though it\u2019s been tested during the recent challenging macro environment. Bitcoin fell substantially in 2022, despite inflation rising to its highest level in decades.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not an effective hedge against the volatility of the stock market, either. Experts say that Bitcoin acts more like a risky tech stock or momentum stock, meaning that it rises when these stocks rise and falls when they fall. That\u2019s not the kind of thing you want from a hedge, which should perform the opposite of the asset being hedged, zigging when the market zags.\n\nWhere is the best place to store bitcoins?\n\nThe best place to store your bitcoins depends on what you intend to use them for. For example, if you plan on trading them, it may be best to keep them with the crypto exchange or broker where you do your trading, especially if you\u2019re trading frequently or in the near term. Like other ETFs, Bitcoin ETFs are held in your brokerage account.\n\nOthers may opt for a crypto wallet, if they\u2019re planning on spending the cryptocurrency or even just locking it down for safekeeping. A crypto wallet can hold and secure your cryptocurrency, though if you\u2019re taking custody of your assets, then it\u2019s your complete responsibility, and you could wind up losing your cryptocurrency if you\u2019re not careful.\n\nTwo popular options for this latter group include hot wallets and cold wallets.\n\nHot wallets\n\nA hot wallet allows your cryptocurrency to be used or moved around easily. Because your coins are secured by software rather than hardware and are still connected to the internet, they\u2019re less secure than cold wallets. But if you\u2019re using a wallet because you intend to use the cryptocurrency, it makes sense to go with a hot wallet. Hot wallets come in a few varieties:\n\nDesktop wallets: You can download wallet software to your computer and manage your crypto holdings from there. When you\u2019re done transacting, you can even take it offline, increasing your security.\n\nYou can download wallet software to your computer and manage your crypto holdings from there. When you\u2019re done transacting, you can even take it offline, increasing your security. Web wallets: This browser plug-in allows you to connect to the blockchain and make transactions quickly, but the internet connection makes it less secure.\n\nThis browser plug-in allows you to connect to the blockchain and make transactions quickly, but the internet connection makes it less secure. Mobile wallets: You can use software on a mobile device if you\u2019re using crypto to pay or transact.\n\nSome providers of hot wallets also offer multiple types of hardware wallets, so you can use one software type across multiple devices.\n\nCold wallets\n\nA cold wallet is more valuable if you really want to lock down your cryptocurrency and make it nearly impervious. Cold wallets rely on hardware, a physical device, to secure your holdings, and it looks like a USB thumb drive. This can be disconnected from the internet, making your holdings very secure. When you\u2019re ready to transact, you can plug it in and conduct business.\n\nWhile more secure than a hot wallet, a cold wallet has other potential risks, including theft of the device, loss of the wallet and even loss of the password. So even cold wallets are not foolproof.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to purchase Bitcoin or other digital currencies as an investment, it\u2019s important to keep costs to a minimum. Given the novelty of the crypto market, many brokers would love to maximize their commissions (in contrast to the stock market where trading fees have gone to zero). Those fees eat into your profits, so look for a way to minimize those frictional costs. But the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs provides a cheaper and more secure way for traders to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile the price of Bitcoin has run high quickly, it still carries serious risks that make it not suitable for everyone. Those looking for conservative investments or who cannot afford to lose money should consider avoiding Bitcoin or trading only with an amount they are willing to lose."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs could open floodgates to $30 trillion wealth management market - CNBC",
        "content": "That changed on Wednesday after the Securities and Exchange Commission cleared the sales of spot bitcoin ETFs, allowing investors to access bitcoin the same way they purchase stock and bond index funds. SEC Chair Gary Gensler continues to issue stern warnings when it comes to crypto investments, but that's not holding back activity.\n\nWide swaths of the investment world missed out on the 2023 rally. According to VanEck CEO Jan van Eck , many fiduciaries, financial advisors and banks had been explicitly told in the past \"not to touch crypto,\" due largely to its unregulated nature.\n\nBitcoin rose as high as $49,000 on Thursday, reaching levels not seen since December 2021, before dropping Friday to around $43,000. It soared 150% last year following a brutal selloff in 2022.\n\n\"Bitcoin is beginning to become a benchmark asset for the younger generation,\" said Anthony Pompliano, founder of Pomp Investments. \"We know most investors can't beat benchmarks, so adding the new benchmark to your asset allocation is the only way to try to keep up.\"\n\nFor the $30 trillion advised wealth management industry, the floodgates could be about to open. Analysts at Standard Chartered anticipate fund inflows in the range of $50 billion to $100 billion in 2024.\n\nNow that bitcoin ETFs are trading across U.S. public markets, many large money managers that have been effectively locked out of crypto finally have a way to access the primary digital currency.\n\nFor its Hundredfold Select Alternatives Fund, mutual fund manager Advisors Preferred Trust is investing up to 15% of total assets for indirect bitcoin exposure through funds and futures contracts, according to a recent prospectus.\n\nPompliano says \"most passive funds are looking for ways to increase performance.\"\n\nBitwise Asset Management is one of the 11 issuers that were granted initial approval for a bitcoin product. Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan said the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, which is offering the lowest fee at 0.2% of holdings, is primarily targeting financial advisors and family offices.\n\n\"That includes RIAs [registered investment advisors] and includes, eventually, wirehouses \u2014 that is a many trillion dollar market,\" said Hougan, adding that advisors are \"increasingly carving out\" an allocation of 1% to 5%. \"We know that they're interested in crypto, and we know that they've been waiting for an ETF.\"\n\nIn a survey of financial advisors recently conducted in conjunction with VettaFi, a data-driven ETF platform, Bitwise found that 88% of advisors interested in purchasing bitcoin were waiting until after a spot bitcoin ETF was approved. Among advisors who already invest in crypto, large allocations (more than 3% of a portfolio) more than doubled to 47% in 2023 from the prior year.\n\n\"For the vast majority of people, a low-cost bitcoin ETF is going to be the easiest way to do that,\" Hougan said.\n\nAccording to data from Robinhood , 81% of bitcoin ETF trading volume in the first week was in individual accounts, with the rest in retirement accounts.\n\nEven before the SEC's announcement Wednesday, the 2022 CFA Institute Investor Trust Study found that 94% of state and local pension plans had some crypto exposure. The new products potentially offer more legitimacy and lower costs for retirement plans that want to increase allocation.\n\nFinancial firms are offering differing advice on how best to enter the space.\n\nIn a report on its website in October, Galaxy Digital said the \"strongest marginal improvement\" occurred when portfolios moved from a 0% to 1% bitcoin allocation. As far back as 2019, WisdomTree said that adding bitcoin to a portfolio that's traditionally 60% equities and 40% bonds \"can improve the risk-return profile\" and that from 2014 to 2019 \"even a one percent allocation led to an 8.3% outperformance versus the base portfolio.\"\n\nFidelity analyzed performance through mid-2022 and noted that \"bitcoin boosted a portfolio's returns during specific periods in the past, though it also came with substantial volatility.\" To date, the firm said, bitcoin has not held up well as a hedge against inflation, but it acknowledged that \"assessing this was challenging, given that inflation has been low throughout most of bitcoin's history.\"\n\nCastle Island Ventures founder Matt Walsh, who previously led a number of Fidelity Investments' blockchain and cryptoasset initiatives, said the types of funds quickest to jump into the market are likely to be those with a focus on high-growth tech stocks. But he also sees broader appeal.\n\n\"I think you could also see it in commodity-based portfolios, like gold-based funds that see this as a sort of digital gold,\" said Walsh.\n\nWATCH: SEC approves bitcoin ETFs"

        "content": "Bitcoin Price Could Reach $1.5 Million By 2030, Predicts ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood\n\nCathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, has reiterated her bullish Bitcoin price prediction of $1.5 million by the year 2030. She cites the recent approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF in the US as increasing the \"probability of the bull case.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Wood went on CNBC and stated that her base case scenario sees Bitcoin reaching $600,000 by the end of the decade. However, under more optimistic conditions, Wood believes the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization could surge over 3,000% from current levels and trade at $1.5 million per coin. This revises her previous forecast of $1 million which she gave last year.\n\nWood points to Bitcoin's expanding fundamentals such as rising hash rate, increasing long-term holder reserves, growth in addresses holding BTC, and now the launch of the spot ETF as driving adoption and usage.\n\nThe SEC approval of ETFs backed by actual Bitcoins has been seen as a milestone event by the cryptocurrency industry. At least nine ETFs began trading on US stock exchanges yesterday, sparking immediate enthusiasm. Bitcoin prices shot up 9% in the first hour of trading on Thursday.\n\nARK Invest is one of the issuers licensed to operate a Bitcoin ETF. Wood claims that while the new spot ETFs will engage in intense competition, she expects the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin Trust ETF to emerge as one of the top performers.\n\nAs CEO of the high-profile ARK Innovation ETF, Cathie Wood has attained celebrity-like status in finance circles for her stakes in disruptive tech companies and digital assets like Bitcoin. It is estimated that nearly 25% of her net worth is invested directly in cryptocurrencies, underscoring her measurably positive outlook.\n\nOther forecasters also see a substantial upside in the Bitcoin price, although typically not to the same magnitude as Wood. Earlier this week, analysts at Standard Chartered Bank predicted $200,000 per Bitcoin by 2025 based on comparing the crypto asset's market with the advent of the first gold-backed ETF in 2004.\n\nWhile only time will tell whether Bitcoin reaches a multi-million dollar valuation, Cathie Wood remains an ardent believer in the network's long-term investment thesis. She stated that Bitcoin represents \"a financial super highway\" and \"public good\" that will expand from current levels as adoption continues increasing.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Bitcoin's Wall Street takeover frustrates crypto's true believers - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe price of bitcoin soared to its highest level in more than two years this week, as speculators bet that the first approved stock market funds for cryptocurrencies would open the door to a wave of new investors.\n\nBut some enthusiasts say the Wall Street takeover betrays their vision of crypto as an alternative financial system away from the prying eyes of government and mainstream finance, and cements bitcoin\u2019s status as merely a vehicle for speculation.\n\n\u201cThe founding principles of bitcoin and decentralised currency is really this cypherpunk, going against the grain, going against the big institutions,\u201d said Xavier Nukajam, a crypto start-up founder from the UK. \u201cIf you create this alternative and have to submit to what already exists . . . you\u2019ve failed.\u201d\n\nThat submission was underlined this week by the fanfare around the launch of bitcoin exchange traded funds, after more than 10 years of applications rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe funds enable investors to own bitcoin via a regulated vehicle listed on the stock market, without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. They are managed by established Wall Street giants including BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity \u2014 a far cry from largely unregulated exchanges such as the collapsed FTX and Binance, which was fined $4.3bn by US authorities last month for money-laundering and violating international sanctions.\n\nThe ETFs, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and CBOE Global Markets, racked up a collective $4.37bn of trading volume on their first day alone, according to CCData.\n\nFranklin Templeton, the asset manager, tried to underline its newfound crypto credentials by turning the eyes of Founding Father Benjamin Franklin in its logo into red lasers on social media \u2014 aping a popular meme denoting enthusiasm for bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of a very long journey,\u201d said Jean-Marie Mognetti, chief executive of asset manager Coinshares. \u201cBitcoin has graduated with distinction and is recognised as an investable asset class.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has travelled a long way since its invention by Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 whose true identity has never been revealed \u2014 in 2008. His famous \u201cwhite paper\u201d described a payments system that stood apart from mainstream financial institutions, instead relying on the public record of blockchain technology.\n\nHe and his early adherents championed the countercultural ethos of \u201ccypherpunk\u201d, with its emphasis on the power of cryptography to protect an individual\u2019s privacy from the long arm of the state.\n\nHowever, that vision has struggled to get real-world traction. Bitcoin\u2019s use as a widespread tool for payments has been limited because it is too cumbersome and slow to verify transactions. El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender in 2021, but consumers there have mostly shunned it.\n\nIts finite supply \u2014 the code that governs bitcoin allows only 21mn tokens ultimately to be created \u2014 led many to tout it as a hedge against inflation and the debasement of mainstream \u201cfiat\u201d currencies. That narrative took a hit last year when global inflation soared but the price of bitcoin tumbled.\n\nToday, such uses for bitcoin are mentioned more rarely. But its status as a speculative asset, albeit a highly volatile one, has been bolstered by its recent rebound and underlined by this week\u2019s fund launches.\n\nThe excitement surrounding bitcoin ETFs \u201cjust exposes how hollow the bitcoin narrative always was\u201d, said Hilary Allen, professor of law at American University Washington College of Law. \u201cAnyone who knew anything about economics or finance could have told you from day one bitcoin was never going to work as a payment system.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have been in this to make a quick buck and having \u2018number go up\u2019,\u201d Allen added, referring to a popular boast among crypto devotees about their market gains.\n\nUS regulators, nervous of the scandals that have plagued the crypto world in recent years, seem inclined to agree.\n\nAlthough the SEC approved the ETFs, chair Gary Gensler was keen to stress that the agency had been pushed into its decision by a US federal appeals court ruling last summer. \u201cWe did not approve bitcoin,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that underlying assets in other ETFs, such as metals, had consumer and industrial uses. \u201cBitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion and terrorist financing.\u201d\n\nFellow SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, who dissented from the approval, warned that spot markets remained open to fraud and manipulation.\n\nStill, some in the industry see a newfound respectability for bitcoin, whose price has soared nearly 1,300 per cent over the past five years, far outstripping other assets.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the libertarian vision was frauds and the shitcoins,\u201d Andrew Bond, senior research analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, referring to smaller cryptocurrencies often launched to make a quick profit for their founders. \u201cIf you look at where there\u2019s been regulatory action, where there\u2019s been problems with the crypto space, it hasn\u2019t been bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCrypto advocates are hoping that the ETFs will boost the bitcoin price because the issuers will be required to buy the token on behalf of their customers. The coins will be held at a custodian, and the issuer will create and redeem shares to represent the owners\u2019 share of the pool.\n\nJad Comair, founder of digital asset investor Melanion Capital, bought his first bitcoin in 2013. \u201cYou had all these technological hurdles,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really worried about losing my phone and as a result losing my bitcoin forever. Now, you\u2019re in the hands of the biggest players in finance like BlackRock and Fidelity, and you know they\u2019re going to take all the necessary measures to safeguard people\u2019s assets.\u201d\n\nThe greatest impact may yet be on the crypto exchanges which have been the only option for people who want to hold bitcoin for the long term.\n\n\u201cThere will now be a bifurcated market in crypto,\u201d said Alison Jimenez, president of Dynamic Securities Analytics, a securities litigation consultancy. \u201cThose that still want to trade crypto will still go to these exchanges. Those that want to hold bitcoin as an investment will just take the simpler and more straightforward ETF route.\u201d\n\nFor some, the introduction of regulated third parties like custodians, exchanges, asset managers and market makers is an example of another emblem of a counterculture that became commoditised by mainstream finance.\n\nJames Angel, associate professor at Georgetown University, pointed out that alcohol and cannabis had once been illegal but have since become traded assets.\n\n\u201cIn the same way, bitcoin was seen as an outlaw outside of the respectable space of investments, and now it\u2019s taking its place in the old boys\u2019 club,\u201d he said. \u201cWall Street is really good at selling stuff, they\u2019ll sell anything they can make a buck on.\u201d"

A Bitcoin ETF is managed by an investment firm and listed on a traditional stock exchange.\n\nWhile it\u2019s down from its November 2021 all-time high, Bitcoin has increased substantially in anticipation of the ETF approvals. Naturally, the increase in price has both individual and institutional investors wondering how they can get in on the action.\n\nTrading directly through a crypto exchange can be complicated for some investors. But with the introduction of ETFs tied to Bitcoin, the process of investing could become much simpler.\n\n\u201cInvestors will now be able to benefit from the added protections of the ETF structure and get Bitcoin exposure as part of a diversified portfolio with less volatility,\u201d said Alex Michalka, vice president of investment research at Wealthfront.\n\nThe SEC approved applications from 11 asset managers to list spot Bitcoin ETFs. Many of the funds cut their fees leading up to the approvals in an effort to win early investors.\n\nWho should invest in Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nInvesting in a Bitcoin ETF could be a good option for people who are looking for a more traditional way of investing in the digital currency. Investing directly in Bitcoin can be complicated and involves questions of how the asset will be stored and which exchange to purchase on. ETFs remove some of that complexity by packaging Bitcoin into ETF form.\n\nThe ETF structure could also make it easier for some institutional investors to enter the crypto market, which could help keep demand for Bitcoin high.\n\nStill, Bitcoin is a high-risk investment with a very short trading history and no underlying cash flows to support its value.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing,\u201d Gensler said.\n\nWhere do you purchase Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nBitcoin ETFs are available through most online brokers who offer traditional securities like stocks and bonds. Some of these brokers may also offer the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin directly, while others only allow you to trade Bitcoin futures.\n\nETFs trade on traditional exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. If you\u2019re interested in the widest offering of cryptocurrencies and are looking to directly invest in digital coins, you\u2019ll need an account with a crypto exchange, such as Binance or Kraken, but these exchanges find themselves in the regulatory crosshairs of the SEC.\n\nBitcoin ETFs\n\nETF Ticker Expense ratio Bitwise Bitcoin ETF BITB 0.0 percent (0.20 percent)* ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB 0.0 percent (0.21 percent)* Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust FBTC 0.0 percent (0.25 percent)* Wisdom Tree Bitcoin Fund BTCW 0.0 percent (0.30 percent)* Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF BTCO 0.0 percent (0.39 percent)* Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund BRRR 0.0 percent (0.49 percent)* iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT 0.12 percent (0.25 percent)* VanEck Bitcoin Trust HODL 0.25 percent Franklin Bitcoin ETF EZBC 0.29 percent Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC 1.50 percent\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\n*Note: Bitwise, ARK, WisdomTree to waive fee for first six months and/or $1 billion in assets. Invesco to waive fee for first six months and/or $5 billion in assets. IShares to lower fee for first 12 months and/or $5 billion in assets. Valkyrie to waive fee for first three months. Fidelity to waive fee until July 31, 2024.\n\nAre Bitcoin ETFs regulated?\n\nAll ETFs that trade on U.S. exchanges are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn August 2023, an appeals court ruled against the SEC for rejecting an application from cryptocurrency asset manager Grayscale Investments to list its spot Bitcoin ETF on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe court ruled that the SEC was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d to reject Grayscale\u2019s application, since its proposed Bitcoin ETF is \u201cmaterially similar\u201d to already-approved Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nIn October, the SEC chose not to appeal the decision.\n\nOther types of crypto-related investments\n\nIf you\u2019re not satisfied with the offering of crypto-related ETFs, you have some other options for investing in the digital currency world.\n\nInvest in crypto directly\n\nYou can always choose to invest directly in cryptocurrencies through a broker or crypto exchange. Some brokers offer a limited number of options for investing in crypto, typically offering only the major coins. If you\u2019re looking for a broad offering, you\u2019ll need to go through a crypto exchange, but be careful to watch out for costly fees associated with buying and selling.\n\nBlockchain ETFs\n\nAnother way to make crypto-adjacent investments is to invest in ETFs focused on blockchain, which is the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain ETFs hold stocks of companies that are using blockchain technology as part of their current and future business plans. Holdings often include a combination of crypto companies, tech giants and financial institutions.\n\nStock in crypto companies\n\nThere is also the option of investing in stocks of companies that are directly involved in cryptocurrency. Coinbase, a large crypto exchange, went public in 2021 and other companies such as PayPal and Robinhood have also made a push into cryptocurrencies. Be sure to thoroughly research each company and understand how much of their business is tied to crypto before investing.\n\nBottom line\n\nTraders eagerly awaiting a Bitcoin ETF got their wish in 2024 after the SEC approved the applications for several funds that invest directly in Bitcoin. There are also other ways to get in on the crypto action through stocks and ETFs that are indirectly tied to crypto or blockchain technology. You can also invest directly through a crypto exchange.\n\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision. In addition, investors are advised that past investment product performance is no guarantee of future price appreciation."

        "content": "Shortly before the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wednesday night, it reissued a \"no FOMO\" warning to investors.\n\nThe warning not to invest over \u201cfear of missing out\u201d emphasized the volatility of digital assets, noting how trendy cryptocurrency investments go through extreme highs and lows, representing billions of dollars in gains \u2014 and losses.\n\n#SECInvestingResolution 5: Say \u201cNO GO to FOMO\u201d (fear of missing out). Just because others might buy a particular investment, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right opportunity for you. Learn more about finding out what\u2019s right for you and your investing goals: https://t.co/fixDWoNFrF pic.twitter.com/SGf1z6xmhL \u2014 SEC Investor Ed (@SEC_Investor_Ed) January 6, 2024\n\nEven after Wednesday\u2019s announcement, SEC chair Gary Gensler said in a statement that despite the approval of the ETF listing, \"we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\"\n\nThe SEC\u2019s blessing brings industry standardization and regulation to digital asset investing. But financial experts urge caution, warning mainstream investors to tread carefully as bitcoin (BTC-USD) is still considered a speculative asset.\n\n\"From a very conservative financial perspective, you have to be very careful,\" Kiran Garimella, assistant professor at the University of South Florida Muma College of Business, told Yahoo Finance. \"If the financial instrument that's being traded doesn't actually represent anything of specific value underlying it, then you'd have to sit back and question that.\"\n\nBut first, what exactly is a spot bitcoin ETF?\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs are investment vehicles that track the performance of bitcoin. Investors purchase shares of the fund, which is managed by asset managers who hold the actual bitcoin and its immediate value (\u201cspot\u201d) as the underlying asset. Those managers make money on management fees and on the slim margin between the actual price of bitcoins (which fluctuates) and the price at which they sell the shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the value of the ETFs will move in tandem with bitcoin, the funds may be more stable as fund managers can utilize different financial instruments within the fund to soften the volatility.\n\n\u201cAn ETF not only makes it much easier to buy and sell and trade these bitcoins, it could also cover some of the strategic risk for you,\u201d Garimella said.\n\nThe world\u2019s first bitcoin originated in 2008 and is credited to a still-unknown person who used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It was formed based on a free market, decentralized ideology where digital currencies are created, distributed, traded, and stored in a peer-to-peer ledger known as the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin's price has recently hovered around $46,500, surging to $49,000 at one point last week as reactions to the SEC approval played out. The value of a coin peaked at an all-time high in 2021 when the price surpassed $65,000. But it crashed to around $16,000 just 12 months later, as investors slowly lost confidence in the sector.\n\nShould bitcoin ETFs be part of your portfolio?\n\nThe highly anticipated SEC approval means that everyday investors can now own bitcoin in their investment or retirement accounts without having to buy digital tokens directly from a crypto exchange.\n\nThe crypto world is still opaque and out of reach to many Americans, but the 11 new spot funds are listed across the NYSE, CBOE, and Nasdaq \u2014 the same platforms where stocks, ETFs, and other traditional securities are bought and sold.\n\nGarimella said the new funds dramatically reduce the administrative risks of investing in bitcoin. Before, interested investors had to open up a \"wallet\" and use \"private keys\" just to own the tokens. Crypto exchanges themselves also carried risks, including hacking and fraud.\n\n\"Oh, boy, you'd have to go through hoops just to acquire a fraction of a bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency for that matter,\" Garimella said. \"Most people had no clue what a wallet or private key is.\"\n\nEven now, only the funds are standardized; a strategic risk is still associated with investing in a bitcoin fund.\n\n\"It's great if you can pull it off by investing in it at $5, sell it for $500, and make a lot of money,\u201d Garimella said. \"But can you be consistent and systematic, and can you come up with a strategy to capitalize on the value generated by that?\"\n\nBroad skepticism remains about crypto in general and its speculative nature. With such instruments, there is no intrinsic value backing the digital asset, only investors\u2019 belief that its price will go up.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency seems like speculation that central banking will be replaced \u2014 that maybe the US dollar is going to be replaced as the dominant reserve currency,\" Mark Higgins, CFA, CFP, and author of \"Investing in US Financial History,\" told Yahoo Finance. \"I am skeptical.\"\n\nThe Vanguard Group, the second-largest provider of ETFs, announced it has no plans to launch a spot bitcoin ETF or offer any crypto-related products.\n\n\"Our perspective is that these products do not align with our offer focused on asset classes such as equities, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio,\" the company said.\n\nOn the other side, Fidelity Investment, one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, launched its Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) on Thursday, calling the product an efficient way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve long believed a spot-priced exchange-traded product would be an efficient way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin,\u201d Cynthia Lo Bessette, head of digital asset management at Fidelity, said in a statement.\n\nYet, in a sign of how uncharted this territory is, Fidelity is requiring investors to execute its Designated Investment Agreement (DIA) when placing an order for the FBTC fund. The DIA certifies that the investors are experienced, have high risk tolerance, and can afford to lose some or all of their investment in the digital product.\n\nEleven of the largest financial asset managers in the world launched a Bitcoin ETF. (Chesnot/Getty Images) (Chesnot via Getty Images)\n\nStill, these ETFs could be a safer way to own bitcoins because asset managers can reduce the funds' risk through sophisticated tactics such as opening up futures contracts, hedging, putting in call options, and improving laddering strategy.\n\n\"When you have an ETF that does all of that stuff, it introduces a certain level of stability or risk management to that underlying instrument,\" Garimella said. \"In a crypto market, you're exposing yourself to a certain level of risk, which could be minimized with the right ETF.\"\n\nThe biggest appeal of bitcoin, the world\u2019s best-known cryptocurrency, is perhaps blockchains' future potential. The technology could transform monetary transactions, its backers believe. Personally, Garimella said he owns bitcoin from an educational perspective and may put more money into an ETF because the digital coin could link to a tangible asset class in the future, given the innovation in the space.\n\n\"But would I advise my grandmother to invest in it? Probably not,\" Garimella said.\n\nWhere to purchase ETFs and what fees to expect\n\nInvestors interested in diversifying their portfolio with digital assets can purchase shares in spot bitcoin ETFs through their brokerage accounts. The funds will be listed similarly to other funds and can be traded throughout the day for liquidity. The approved ETFs are fund products from big financial players such as Fidelity, Invesco, and BlackRock.\n\nSEC chair Gary Gensler said in a statement that despite the approval of the ETF listing, \"we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\" (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) (Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images)\n\nMany firms have announced their fees for managing the ETFs. Blackrock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager with nearly $10 trillion in managed assets, is charging investors 0.25%, a decline from the 0.30% it previously set. Grayscale is charging 1.5%, while Franklin said it would waive management fees through August, a sign of how competitive this new market is.\n\nToday, bitcoin remains the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization \u2014 $913 billion as of Jan. 11.\n\nRebecca Chen is a reporter for Yahoo Finance and previously worked as an investment tax certified public accountant (CPA).\n\nClick here for the latest personal finance news to help you with investing, paying off debt, buying a home, retirement, and more\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "Bitcoin slid on Friday to end an otherwise momentous week for the cryptocurrency, with the launch of 11 bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. after a yearslong battle for institutional acceptance of the asset.\n\nThe price of bitcoin dropped 5.79% to $43,830.28, according to Coin Metrics, giving back gains from earlier this week and pulling most of the crypto market into the red. On Thursday, it briefly surged to $49,058.48, its highest level since December 2021. For the week, it finished slightly lower by 0.01%.\n\nMeanwhile, ether slipped -1.02%, trimming earlier gains. It rose 15% for the week, its first winning week in three and its best week since March 2023. Investors rotated into ether and out of bitcoin following the widely expected U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval of bitcoin ETFs. On Thursday it reached highs not seen since May 2022.\n\n\"In our view, the crypto market has already moved to the next narrative, with ETH rallying more than bitcoin, likely on the expectation that crypto's second largest token could also see an ETF approval,\" Alex Saunders, an analyst at Citi, said in a note Friday."

        "title": "Crypto bulls see bitcoin flying above $100,000 after ETF approval - CNBC",
        "content": "Chesnot | Getty Images\n\nCryptocurrency bulls say bitcoin could surge to more than $100,000 this year after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made a pivotal step to approve the first-ever U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Several crypto investors CNBC spoke with said they see the world's top cryptocurrency rising in 2024, as the effects of approval of a bitcoin ETF, which would diversify the range of investors that can gain exposure to the cryptocurrency, begin to become more apparent. Bitcoin's price hasn't moved a great deal since the news of the SEC ETF approval came in, which saw the agency give 11 products the green light. The regulator approved rule changes to allow the creation of the ETFs, but stressed that this move \"should in no way signal the Commission's willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\" Prices reacted to that substantially since the SEC's move Wednesday. Bitcoin's price was trading at $46,118 apiece Friday, down around 0.4%. It briefly topped $49,000 to levels not seen since December 2021. Over time, though, ETFs, coupled with other developments in the crypto world, are expected to drive major upward movements in bitcoin.\n\nWhat's a bitcoin ETF?\n\nETFs allow more retail investors to hold bitcoin indirectly via a share traded on a stock exchange. Investors expect acceptance of the token could begin to become more mainstream with more and more institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others offering these products. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, said he's been increasing his exposure to bitcoin, ethereum, solana and other cryptocurrencies over the past year.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"I think this is a really big breakthrough for bitcoin as a digital asset, it's a much broader story for digital property in general,\" Scaramucci told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at the CfC conference in St Moritz.\n\n\"I think bitcoin will probably see its all-time high at the end of the year, and is likely to go through its all-time high by the end of the year.\" As for what price Scaramucci expects for bitcoin, the noted investor said he sees the cryptocurrency hitting $100,000 over the next year. \"Could bitcoin be $100,000, which is more or a little bit more than a double over the next year? I do believe that.\" But he made a caveat: \"I have been wrong so many times before.\"\n\nHe compared the token's ETF approval to the 2004 green lighting of the first spot gold ETF. That development took years to translate into major price gains, but gold eventually skyrocketed in value. The precious metal is now worth around $1,592.76, up around 556% since 2004 when the SPDR Gold Shares ETF began trading. Crypto bulls expect a similar direction of travel for bitcoin \u2014 except it'll be much quicker this time around.\n\n\"We see it as digital gold,\" Scaramucci told CNBC. \"If you look at the market cap of gold, $13 trillion, there's no reason why bitcoin couldn't be 50% or 60% of that market capitalization. So that implies a 10x price over then next decade.\" Many crypto investors have compared bitcoin with gold in the past. But it's worth noting that, while backers believe they have similar qualities \u2014 like a finite supply and immunity to external economic and geopolitical headwinds \u2014 bitcoin hasn't exactly passed the mark as \"digital gold.\" Past price performance over the past few years has shown bitcoin trades in correlation with stocks, in particular the tech-heavy Nasdaq, rather than gold. Bitcoin did massively outperform the Nasdaq in 2023, many other risk-assets, and gold in 2023. But the cryptocurrency primarily got a boost from speculation that the Federal Reserve would dial back its aggressive interest rate rises, which would be supportive for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Vijay Ayyar, vice president of international for Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX, said ETF approvals had been \"priced in for some time now.\" Bitcoin's already gone from about $25,000 to nearly $47,000 since October. \"The next leg up is when we start seeing Bitcoin purchases for the ETF itself,\" Ayyar said. That could happen in the next week or two.\" \"If sentiment is to be believed, we are potentially looking at an accelerated move to new all-time highs some time this year, given we also have the Bitcoin halving coming up in April this year,\" Ayyar added.\n\n2023 was bitcoin's turnaround year\n\nIf bitcoin were to reach those levels, it would mark a turnaround for an industry that's been in the doldrums since the collapse of FTX, the once $32 billion crypto exchange, in 2022. FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of all seven criminal counts brought against him by federal prosecutors in the U.S. last year.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn 2022, bitcoin was already falling sharply, with sky-high inflation and higher interest rates knocking prices of digital currencies across the board. But FTX's collapse caused deep distrust in the crypto industry among consumers, business players in the industry and regulators, as one of the largest names in the field was exposed for using assets it held on behalf of customers to make risky trades in other crypto assets and risky crypto-linked derivatives. The crypto market saw a little over $2 trillion erased from its market capitalization, as investors got cold feet and abandoned digital tokens en masse. In 2023, however, it was a different story. Bitcoin's price rose more than doubled for the year, with the token's price climbing some 152%. Other digital tokens also saw price gains. Ether roughly doubled in price, and XRP, solana, and ada also made strong gains. \"2022 was the worst year for us [but] 2023 happened to be the best year for us. So it's been the best and worst of times,\" Scaramucci said. Also in 2023, Binance CEO and founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stepped down as the company's CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice. Many crypto investors see this as a chance to move forward and draw a line under bad behavior in the industry. Industry executives are calling the start of another bull run. They say that, on top of the approval of a bitcoin ETF, the bitcoin \"halving\" is a factor that will drive gains in 2024. The halving, which happens every four years, is an event written in bitcoin's code. The rewards so-called miners get for mining bitcoin is cut in half. This keeps a cap on the supply of bitcoin, of which there will only ever be 21 million. In previous price cycles, halving preceded a rise in the price of bitcoin.\n\n$250,000 by July?\n\nTim Draper, founder of Draper Associates, believes the bitcoin halving \u2014 along with other factors \u2014 could spur the price of bitcoin to hit $250,000 by July. The billionaire investor said he sees increased bitcoin adoption among mainstream investors and the token's much-anticipated halving event driving it to a new all-time high.\n\nwatch now"

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs are a siren song, not proof of concept - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe writer is chief executive and chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors\n\nProof of concept typically means evidence that a design idea is feasible. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have suggested that the approval of bitcoin ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission this week is substantial proof of concept that cryptocurrencies are viable and marks a big step towards their integration into the financial system. The question, however, is viable and feasible as what?\n\nThe primary purpose of currencies throughout economic history has been to facilitate consumption, business dealings and capital investment. Trading, speculating and hedging happen after a currency begins to be widely used and its transactional economic purpose is well established.\n\nNo one actively traded or speculated in the dollar, the pound, the yen or other major global currencies before they were used for economic transactions. The required proof of concept is their economic use. Of course, not all currencies achieve this. Some emerging countries\u2019 inflation rates are so high that locals prefer to use established currencies, such as the US dollar, in day-to-day transactions. Cryptocurrency boosters have suggested that bitcoin might be a preferable option.\n\nEl Salvador is famous for trying to make the connection between bitcoin speculation and economic reality but, so far, the results are questionable. Despite claims that the flow of funds into El Salvador using bitcoin would be cheaper and easier than those using the US dollar, the El Salvadoran central bank estimates that only about 1 per cent of received remittances in the first six months of 2023 were in bitcoin.\n\nIf cryptocurrencies are indeed currencies, and not speculative collectible fads like baseball cards or Beanie Babies, then they would be the world\u2019s first traded currency with no economic purpose. Outside of relatively small constructive uses in some emerging economies, one might be able to pay for fentanyl or arms shipments covertly, hide wealth or fund terrorists, but they are of little value for day-to-day transactions like buying groceries or paying most bills.\n\nAnd despite the enthusiasm surrounding issuance of bitcoin ETFs this week, this does not facilitate the broader transactional use of cryptocurrencies in the US or global economies. It will still be hard to buy a cup of coffee with it.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin\u2019s purpose is purely as a vehicle for trading and speculation, then these ETFs might indeed be proof of concept. They will probably encourage participation among individual investors who feel traditional exchange trading via better-known financial institutions is safer than the previously existing means of trading cryptos.\n\nWell-established financial institutions might want to be wary. The deflation of both the technology and housing bubbles revealed legal and financial liabilities they didn\u2019t anticipate. The spread of bitcoin speculation and any subsequent deflation could expose similar risks.\n\nDemocratisation of the market is a common characteristic of financial bubbles. The idea that the playing field has been levelled and everyone now gets access to an asset has historically been a siren\u2019s song luring investors to participate in financial bubbles. Bitcoin ETFs seem to be this bubble\u2019s bait.\n\nThey could even be an impediment to the US Federal Reserve\u2019s inflation fighting. Bubbles are inherently inflationary because an economy diverts capital to bubble assets instead of to productive resources. Simply put, money flows to things the economy doesn\u2019t need at the expense of things it does. If the resulting undersupply of goods and services can\u2019t keep up with aggregate demand, or productivity doesn\u2019t significantly improve, then a bubble\u2019s misallocation of capital ignites inflationary pressures.\n\nAs evidence mounts that globalisation is starting to contract, the US is in a somewhat precarious position because of its massive trade deficit. One might therefore expect capital flows to shift towards improving the country\u2019s woefully inadequate infrastructure and capital base. The advent of bitcoin ETFs could further sidetrack capital towards unproductive speculative use.\n\nSome have suggested that bitcoin is a digital version of gold. That seems to ignore the fact that such precious metals and commodities have economic uses and aren\u2019t merely a means of speculation or a store of value. The fillings in my mouth or my wedding ring won\u2019t ever be made of bitcoin.\n\nIn fact, it better resembles digital tulips, echoing the Dutch tulip bubble of the 1600s. This craze got so extreme that the Amsterdam Stock Exchange began to regularly trade bulbs alongside equities. The cryptocurrency rage is now extreme enough that established exchanges including the NYSE and Nasdaq will start trading bitcoin ETFs. This will probably spur additional public interest, but for the wrong reasons.\n\nThose looking to pile in should remember that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies still seem a tool for speculation, rather than currencies with proven economic merit. The actions of this week will simply expand that speculation to a broader, and likely unsuspecting, audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Net income for the quarter at the wealth group was $491 million, a decline of 31% when compared to the same quarter last year.\n\nSince 2019, Wells Fargo & Co., the giant bank, has been overhauling its wealth management business, jettisoning noncore operations like its overseas client operations and rebranding its private bank, and focusing on overhauling management and better retaining its private client wealth management advisors.\n\nMany of those advisors have been eying its independent arm, Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, or FiNet, where they work with greater autonomy and receive a more generous percentage of the revenue, but also shoulder more of the expenses as independent contractors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made significant investments the last few years across our franchise to better serve our customers and help drive growth,\u201d Mike Santomassimo, the bank\u2019s chef financial officer, said on a conference call Friday morning with investors. \u201cWe expect the revenue growth that these investments should generate in businesses like corporate investment banking and wealth and investment management will help fund additional investments.\u201d"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin's (BTC) Price Plunged This Week - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "On Jan. 10, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the market's first 11 Bitcoin (BTC -6.91%) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Unlike previous \"Bitcoin ETFs,\" which were pinned only to future contracts or held shares of Bitcoin-related companies, these new funds directly hold Bitcoins. Over the long term, these ETFs should closely track the spot price of Bitcoin and represent a much easier way to invest in the cryptocurrency than stand-alone crypto wallets.\n\nThe SEC's approvals also represent a big vote of confidence in Bitcoin's future as a mainstream asset. But Bitcoin's price tumbled after the first batch of ETFs started trading on Jan. 11. As of Jan. 13, it trades at about $42,500 -- representing a near-10% decline in just five days. Let's see why its price dropped and where it might be headed over the next 12 months.\n\nWhy did Bitcoin's price decline?\n\nBitcoin's price is volatile and difficult to predict. It hit its all-time high of about $69,000 during the peak of the crypto rally in Nov. 2021 but dropped to just $16,000 by the end of 2022. That decline was caused largely by rising interest rates, which drove investors away from speculative investments, the failures of several high-profile tokens and exchanges, and concerns regarding tighter regulations for the crypto industry.\n\nBut in 2023, Bitcoin's price soared 154% to over $42,000. That rally was driven by slower rate hikes and the market's renewed interest in the crypto market. Many investors also expected the SEC to finally approve Bitcoin's first spot price ETFs.\n\nTherefore, Bitcoin's recent decline only erased its gains since the beginning of 2024. It seems like some short-term traders bid up the digital currency's price in anticipation of the recent ETF approvals and then quickly took profits as the euphoria faded.\n\nDon't ignore the long-term catalysts\n\nBitcoin's price could remain under pressure as it moves past the ETF approvals. However, three catalysts that could drive its price higher remain on the horizon.\n\nFirst, the ETF approvals will make it easier for large institutional investors to accumulate Bitcoin on the open market. Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, who oversees the recently approved Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB -5.69%), believes the price of Bitcoin will hit $1.5 million as institutional investors buy more. Fidelity, the investment giant that just launched the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), claims Bitcoin's price will hit $100 million by 2035 and $1 billion by 2038.\n\nThose long-term estimates might be too bullish, but I think it's reasonable to assume the Bitcoin ETF approvals will set a floor under its volatile price. That stabilization could bring back big investors and drive Bitcoin's price back toward its all-time highs. According to Coin Price Forecast's more moderate estimates, its price might reach $240,000 by the end of 2035.\n\nSecond, Bitcoin experiences a \"halving\" every four years, which cuts the rewards for Bitcoin mining in half. That isn't great news for miners like Marathon (MARA -7.46%) and Riot (RIOT -6.82%) because it increases their mining costs, but it will likely drive Bitcoin's market price higher by reducing the available supply. The next halving will occur in the first half of 2024.\n\nLast but not least, persistent inflation could drive more investors to accumulate Bitcoin and gold as hedges against the devaluation of fiat currencies. More countries struggling with hyperinflation might even follow El Salvador's lead and adopt Bitcoin as a national currency -- which would further solidify its reputation as a safe haven asset.\n\nDon't let double-digit drops overshadow the triple-digit gains\n\nBitcoin will likely go through more wild swings and double-digit drops over the next 12 months. But over the next decade, it could generate triple-digit gains for investors who tune out all the near-term noise and focus on the long-term catalysts. Simply put, investors should consider its recent post-ETF approval pullback a good buying opportunity."

Could corporate financial officers now consider Bitcoin a potential corporate treasury reserve asset, for instance?\n\nIn 2021, the SEC greenlighted Bitcoin futures ETFs backed by derivatives that traded on commodities exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but these didn\u2019t attract mainstream investors.\n\nThus far, only a handful of large public corporations have substantially invested in Bitcoin: Tesla, Block (formerly Square) and most notably, MicroStrategy, which has a reported 174,500 Bitcoins in its corporate treasury that makes it by far the biggest public company that holds crypto.\n\nMore typically, corporate financial officers have favored short-dated US Treasuries, cash, commercial paper, and money market funds for their reserves\u2014not high-risk assets like crypto.\n\nCautious Corporates\n\nThere are good reasons why institutional investors and corporates may not be changing their stripes anytime soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is the problem of Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing volatility, as the Europe-based division head of a leading business consultancy, who was not authorized to speak, told Global Finance. \u201cSo, the ETFs will be more used as an investment vehicle for asset managers than by CFOs.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s price gyrations \u201cmake investing a bit more dangerous for many companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of corporates will not take the MicroStrategy approach,\u201d Andr\u00e9 Casterman, managing director of Casterman Advisory, says that CFOs will not move their treasury funds into crypto en masse soon.\n\nThere are other reasons beyond crypto\u2019s price volatility. Most large public companies aren\u2019t owned or controlled by disruptive, hard-charging individuals\u2014like the triad of corporate treasury pioneers: Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, Block\u2019s Jack Dorsey and MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor, who can do as they like in this area. Pension fund managers, by comparison, answer to investment boards, while CFOs of publicly traded companies must be mindful of shareholders.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Casterman, managing director of Casterman Advisory, says that CFOs will not move their treasury funds into crypto en masse soon.\n\nThus, \u201cthe career risk for those in charge is just too great for them to dive in and allocate their treasury cash to Bitcoin instead of straight cash or USTs,\u201d recently posted James Lavish, co-managing partner at the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund.\n\nStill, companies like BlackRock and Fidelity do extensive due diligence before applying for an ETF, assessing security issues and gauging customer demand. In a sense, they have already vetted Bitcoin and bestowed their seal of approval upon it. At the least, they provide some assurance for corporate CFOs who may have been sitting on the fence about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe treasury assets diversification argument is complex, however, because there is a strong belief that public companies should focus on their core business operation, \u201csuggesting that investing in Bitcoin may not align with their core business objective,\u201d noted Jim Kyung-Soo Liew, associate professor of finance at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Carey Business School.\n\nLiew continued, \u201cconsidering the accessibility of Bitcoin through ETFs, it\u2019s evident that the career risk for CFOs has now substantially diminished.\u201d\n\nThere could also be a sort of \u2018virtuous cycle\u2019 process at play here, at least regarding volatility. The argument is that as more corporations and institutional investors invest in BTC, Bitcoin becomes less volatile because these groups tend to be long-term investors. This, in turn, brings in more institutional investors, and so on.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, in a competitive environment where peer companies are actively and aggressively venturing into Bitcoin, FOMO [fear of missing out] could kick in and exert significant pressure on corporate CFOs\u2019 decisions to include Bitcoin,\u201d said Liew.\n\nOthers agree that this week\u2019s events could spur large institutions to invest in cryptocurrency. \u201cA spot Bitcoin ETF could inspire some institutions who were on the fence to incorporate digital assets into their portfolios,\u201d Lim Wee Kian, CEO of DBS Digital Exchange, told Global Finance.\n\nHowever, Lim adds that an ETF alone is just one piece of the puzzle before cryptocurrencies achieve widespread adoption by corporates. \u201cEqually as important is the proliferation of institutional-grade platforms that offer investors peace of mind regarding how the ETF\u2019s underlying asset is held,\u201d said Lim.\n\nRegarding a potential corporate allocation of Bitcoin, \u201cThere are some models which suggest 4-6% portfolio ratio is optimal,\u201d the consulting firm executive (cited above) continued. \u201cPotentially, some CFOs will go that way. But to do so, they must first invest in skilled people who understand this market and the volatility. This is quite different from the bond, FX or equity markets.\u201d\n\nIn sum, the SEC\u2019s approval of 11 Bitcoin ETFs isn\u2019t likely to overturn the traditional financial and corporate communities any time soon. Still, it can become the basis for a new round of financial innovation. Or, as Casterman told Global Finance, at a minimum, \u201cit\u2019s a great opportunity for asset managers to create new products.\u201d"

It is an asset class that protects you.\"\n\nFink's recognition of Bitcoin as a protective asset suggests helps shift the narrative surrounding the digital currency, emphasizing its role as a safeguard amid economic uncertainties. This endorsement from the head of the world's largest asset management firm is a significant milestone for Bitcoin's acceptance within mainstream financial circles.\n\n\"Unlike gold where we manufacture new gold, we're almost at the ceiling of the amount of Bitcoin that can be created,\" Fink continued. \"What we're trying to do is offer an instrument that can store wealth.\"\n\nThe statement comes just two days after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved BlackRock's, alongside 10 other asset managers, spot Bitcoin ETF. Fink's positive sentiment further adds to the growing chorus of influential figures recognizing Bitcoin's potential to play a protective role in an investment portfolio.\n\nAs the Bitcoin market continues to evolve, statements like these from key industry figures contribute to shaping a positive narrative around Bitcoin, potentially influencing broader market sentiments and paving the way for increased adoption.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs have a key difference from their stock fund counterparts - CNBC",
        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pushed for bitcoin exchange-traded funds to have a key difference from major stock funds, and that decision's effect on how the funds trade will only become clear over time.\n\nThe bitcoin funds that launched Thursday are using a share redemption process that turns the underlying crypto into cash. Most ETFs primarily use an in-kind redemption process, where the underlying asset does not have to be actually sold.\n\nWhile the rules around share redemption do not directly affect the smaller trades that retail investors do in brokerage accounts, they come into play for the execution of larger trades made by institutions.\n\nThere is some concern that using the cash-only redemption model could make the plumbing of the ETFs less efficient.\n\n\"It could be that certain funds are capable of getting better execution prices than others. The other thing is that those trading costs, whether it be transaction costs or the market impact type costs that aren't necessarily quantifiable, those costs are now borne by investors,\" said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar.\n\nIn-kind redemptions are typically used by major equity funds and, as crypto asset manager Grayscale pointed out in a presentation to the SEC, commodities funds. Using cash-only redemption could result in ETFs that have weaker liquidity and wider bid-ask spreads, Grayscale argued.\n\nBut Steven McClurg, chief investment officer at Valkyrie, said the situation may be more analogous to fixed income ETFs, where cash redemption is more common because the authorized market participants working with the funds may be more comfortable with that process.\n\n\"In this situation, there's a lot of APs that don't have the ability to transact in bitcoin. If it was an in-kind model, then it would throw a lot of advantage toward the APs that do have that ability. \u2026 We want as many market makers and authorized participants in these products as possible, because that makes for better markets,\" McClurg said.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, the decision to only allow cash redemptions simplifies the chain of custody for bitcoin and removes broker-dealers from the process, said Jeremy Senderowicz, an attorney and shareholder at Vedder Price, a firm that specializes in ETFs.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement Wednesday that broker-dealers are still expected to follow best interest regulations with regard to crypto products, a potential sign that the SEC is wary of those firms becoming directly involved with these funds.\n\nThe good news for investors is that the cash-redemption process should not change the tax treatment of the funds, even though cash redemptions are more generally associated with mutual funds than ETFs. Many investors and financial advisors choose to use ETFs because the funds give them more control over when to create tax events.\n\n\"These things are taxed as grantor trusts. Consensus is that when an AP is redeemed for cash, the tax consequences only accrue to that AP. So it is not like cash redemptions on mutual funds and regular 40-Act ETFs where, to the extent that it's a cash transaction, taxable income stemming from fund transactions is passed through to all the shareholders,\" Senderowicz said.\n\n\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

The top crypto has fallen 10.2% since the ETFs went live to IBIT\u2019s 8.9% losses, more than a full percent between them.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF Tracker\n\nIn fact, IBIT\u2019s share price is doing better than all its rivals.

The first hour is generally to be avoided on regular trading days, let alone on those marking the debut of a brand-new ETF class.)\n\nBlackRock\u2019s ETF is storing value better than bitcoin\n\nPrice aside, IBIT and GBTC are so far leading the pack in terms of volume, with $334 million and $1 billion today, respectively.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETFs surpass $4B in trade volume while BTC\u2019s price falters\n\nGBTC, now a spot ETF, was previously a closed-ended fund for which shares could not be redeemed for bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear at this stage how much capital has flowed out of GBTC and into other funds, if any, but the vehicle had around $29 billion in bitcoin before its conversion earlier this week.\n\nSome discrepancy between the price of bitcoin and the share price of ETFs is to be expected \u2014 ETFs offer exposure to the underlying asset and the value of that exposure is influenced by its own supply, demand and liquidity.\n\nMuch of the appeal of spot ETFs is that they should track the price of the underlying asset closer than funds with synthetic exposure through futures contracts.\n\nBITO, the largest futures-backed bitcoin ETF with more than $2 billion in assets as of earlier this week, is practically mirroring BlackRock\u2019s fund.\n\nWhile all this could change on a dime, overperformance in IBIT, or any other beating bitcoin, could be indicative of investor preferences, with those shares in hotter demand relative to the rest.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Why the SEC 'Begrudgingly' Approved Spot Bitcoin ETFs - National Association of Plan Advisors",
        "content": "After first denying that it had approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETP) following the hacking of the agency\u2019s X/Twitter account, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it was, in fact, approving multiple applications for the products.\n\nThis comes more than 10 years after the filing of the first spot bitcoin ETP application.\n\nAccording to a Jan. 10 statement by SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, the Commission approved the listing and trading of 11 spot bitcoin ETP shares. Those include:\n\nthe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, and the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF on the NYSE;\n\nthe iShares Bitcoin Trust and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund under Nasdaq; and\n\nthe ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, the VanEck Bitcoin Trust, the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, and the Franklin Bitcoin ETF under BZX.\n\nIn making the announcement, Gensler explained that the Commission had disapproved more than 20 exchange rule filings for spot bitcoin ETPs from 2018 through March 2023, but that circumstances had changed.\n\nWhile the new set of filings were similar to those disapproved in the past, what changed was that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that the Commission failed to adequately explain its reasoning in disapproving the listing and trading of Grayscale\u2019s proposed ETP. Consequently, the court vacated the Grayscale Order and remanded the matter to the Commission.\n\n\u201cBased on these circumstances and those discussed more fully in the approval order, I feel the most sustainable path forward is to approve the listing and trading of these spot bitcoin ETP shares,\u201d Gensler stated in his announcement.\n\nCommissioner Hester Peirce was a little more blunt in her statement, however. \u201cWe squandered a decade of opportunities to do our job. If we had applied the standard we use for other commodity-based ETPs, we could have approved these products years ago, but we refused to do so until a court called our bluff,\u201d she stated. \u201cAnd even now our approval comes only begrudgingly, as demonstrated by our continued insistence that these products satisfy a correlation test we have not demanded of prior commodity-based ETPs.\u201d\n\nConcern About Retirement Accounts\n\nWhile some industry observers believe the SEC\u2019s approval could help propel the inclusion and acceptance of bitcoin in retirement plans, not all the Commissioners were on board.\n\nIn a statement of dissent, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw said that she is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the Commission\u2019s approval, particularly as it relates to protection of retirement accounts. \u201cI am concerned that these products will flood the markets and land squarely in the retirement accounts of U.S. households who can least afford to lose their savings to the fraud and manipulation that appears prevalent in the spot bitcoin markets and will impact the ETPs,\u201d she stated.\n\nTo that end, she explained that she's worried that it will create the \u201cimprimatur\u201d of Commission approval and oversight of the underlying spot markets when really no such oversight exists. \u201cI am concerned that there will be confusion about what exactly these products are \u2013 (they are not ETFs registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the ubiquitous products that today are used by millions saving for retirement) \u2013 and that investors may infer protections that do not in fact exist.\u201d\n\nAs to whether the Department of Labor might weigh in on the SEC\u2019s approval of the applications, given its previous warning about investing plan assets in cryptocurrency, American Retirement Association Chief Legal Officer Allison Wielobob offered some perspective.\n\n\u201cConsidering the Labor Department\u2019s prior statements on plan investments in cryptocurrency, I would not be surprised if we heard from them on this in some fashion. On the other hand, Labor does not tend to publish superfluous guidance, so perhaps we won\u2019t seem something until they have a real-world example in front of them,\u201d Wielobob explained.\n\nStill No Love for Crypto\n\nImportantly, Gensler noted that the Commission action is \u201ccabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin,\u201d and that it should in \u201cno way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the approval should not signal anything about the Commission\u2019s views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants, Gensler further explained. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said in the past, and without prejudging any one crypto asset, the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws,\u201d he stated.\n\nInvestor Protections\n\nThe SEC chairman further outlined how the Commission\u2019s approval will include certain protections for investors.\n\nFirst, he noted, sponsors of bitcoin ETPs will be required to provide full disclosures about the products in public registration statements and required periodic filings. Gensler added that their action does not endorse the disclosed ETP arrangements, such as custody arrangements.\n\nSecond, because these products will be listed and traded on registered national securities exchanges, they will be required to have rules designed to prevent fraud and manipulation. The Commission will also be monitoring the registrants closely to ensure they are enforcing those rules, and will fully investigate any fraud or manipulation in the securities markets, including schemes that use social media platforms.\n\nFurther, existing rules and standards of conduct will apply to the purchase and sale of the approved ETPs, the chairman further emphasized. This includes, for example, Regulation Best Interest when broker-dealers recommend ETPs to retail investors, as well as a fiduciary duty under the Investment Advisers Act for investment advisers.\n\nFinally, Gensler noted that Commission staff is separately completing the review of registration statements for 10 spot bitcoin ETPs simultaneously, which he suggests will help create a level playing field for issuers and promote fairness and competition.\n\n\u201cWhile we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin. Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,\u201d he concluded."

That will only happen if there's an economic catastrophe, Kevin O'Leary says.\n\nThe tech evangelist and Ark Invest CEO issued the striking forecast this week after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved her and other firms' spot bitcoin ETFs for the first time \u2014 a decision that cryptocurrency fans hailed as a key step toward mainstream adoption of tokens.\n\nIn a CoinDesk interview, O'Leary dismissed Wood's most optimistic price target as unrealistic unless something goes terribly wrong.\n\n\"To actually peg a price of that kind of appreciation would mean that the American economy collapsed in my view, so that is not a good speculation,\" the \"Shark Tank\" investor and O'Leary Ventures chairman said. Bitcoin serves as a hedge against the global economy, he said, so its price would probably only explode that much if there was a major disaster.\n\n\"For bitcoin to appreciate that quickly to that price would mean that the US economy had somehow faltered in my view,\" he said. \"So no, I don't agree with that price point.\"\n\nStill, O'Leary predicted bitcoin would at least triple in price from about $46,000 today to between $150,000 and $250,000 by 2030, and outpace the S&P 500 over the next five years. Wood's bear case for the most valuable crypto is $250,000 by 2030, while her base case is north of $680,000.\n\nO'Leary \u2014 whose nickname is \"Mr. Wonderful\" \u2014 welcomed the SEC decision. He said it should pave the way for bitcoin to be listed on a regulated US exchange, allowing sovereign wealth funds and other large financial institutions to invest in it, which could supercharge the token's gains in the years ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe veteran investor, previously a frontman for Sam Bankman-Fried's bankrupt FTX, said he's bet on wider acceptance of crypto by securing a direct stake in Canada's WonderFi, and an indirect stake in M2, which launched in Abu Dhabi last year.\n\n\"I want to own the picks and shovels of crypto, and those are the regulated exchanges,\" he said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

This week, we\u2019re shining the spotlight on Gary Gensler\u2019s crypto record.\n\nOn my way to work this morning I overheard a commuter: \u201cSometimes the new year at work starts slow, other times it hits you like a train.\u201d\n\nOne person who would probably agree is US Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, who this week cast the deciding vote that approved 11 bitcoin spot exchange traded funds. It grants the coin Wall Street legitimacy, but leaves the self-proclaimed crypto cop on the beat with a shaky legacy on digital assets.\n\nUnder Gensler\u2019s leadership the SEC has earned a hard-hitting reputation, issuing a series of lawsuits against many of the crypto industry\u2019s biggest players. Platforms such as Kraken have felt the full force of the regulator, discontinuing its staking programme in the US and paying $30mn in a settlement in February last year.\n\nKraken is also fighting separate charges filed by the SEC in November that it allegedly operated as an unregistered securities business. The agency\u2019s most high-profile lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance are still open too, so it remains to be seen how successful the SEC\u2019s offensive will be.\n\nUp until this week, it also staunchly opposed bitcoin spot ETFs, earning praise from crypto\u2019s plentiful naysayers in the process.\n\nBut to paraphrase a famous saying: it takes decades to build a reputation and seconds to destroy one.\n\n\u201cThis decision is unfortunately not just going to undermine Gensler\u2019s record, but even worse, I am concerned it\u2019s going to undermine the SEC\u2019s credibility more broadly,\u201d Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of non-profit Better Markets, told me.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s fundamental point against spot bitcoin ETFs has long been that the cryptocurrency trades on largely unregulated markets and thus its price is prone to manipulation. Straightforward, right?\n\nThat view came under scrutiny last year after a judge in Washington DC found the regulator to be \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d when it rejected asset manager Grayscale\u2019s attempt to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, claiming it failed to justify treating bitcoin spot and future products so differently.\n\nThe problem was that the SEC had already given the green light to bitcoin futures ETFs \u2014 similar products that track the price of futures traded on the CME in Chicago rather than the price of the underlying asset, which are traded on unregulated exchanges.\n\nIn Gensler\u2019s defence, if a regulated entity like the CME and a federal agency like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are satisfied that it\u2019s not a manipulated market, then it\u2019s hard for the SEC to turn down a bitcoin futures ETF.\n\nSo once the court ruled that the SEC needed to more clearly distinguish between bitcoin futures and spot products, it was likely that Gensler would eventually have to yield.\n\n\u201cWe are now faced with a new set of filings similar to those we have disapproved in the past. Circumstances, however, have changed,\u201d the chair said in defence of his agency\u2019s decision.\n\nBut some argue that the arrival of bitcoin ETFs changes little. \u201cBitcoin in an ETF is still bitcoin, with all of its Ponzi-like nature and all of its manipulability,\u201d said Hilary Allen, professor of financial regulation at American University, adding \u201cfor the uninitiated, seeing it in an ETF might seem to convey a sense of legitimacy, they might not realise that it\u2019s just lipstick on a pig\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s worth reminding ourselves just how disorderly those unregulated exchanges \u2014 which have been bitcoin\u2019s most natural home since its inception \u2014 have been.\n\nSince the SEC approved bitcoin futures ETFs, FTX has gone down as one of the largest frauds in American history, and Binance paid a whopping $4.3bn fine to settle criminal charges.\n\n\u201cWell-known financial firms getting involved gives Main Street Americans a false comfort,\u201d added Kelleher, saying the fact the SEC will oversee issuers is \u201ccompletely meaningless because the price of the ETF is based on the price of the bitcoin spot market, and there is no cop on the beat there\u201d.\n\nAnd when Gensler\u2019s time as chair is all said and done, he may not have even brought the crypto crowd onside, despite having ushered in a potentially revolutionary wave of new money for the sector.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone in crypto is going to be praising Gensler,\u201d Jeremy Senderowicz of law firm Vedder Price, told me, adding: \u201cIf only because he was forced to approve these at the point of further court battling. So, in that respect, crypto will probably be more appreciative to the courts than to Gensler.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on Gary Gensler\u2019s crypto record after this week? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nChristmas highlights\n\nWe were off for Christmas but crypto never stops. Here\u2019s some highlights from the holiday period.\n\nCrypto\u2019s latest market frenzy prompted bitcoin mining firms such as CleanSpark and Bitfarms to splash more than half a billion dollars on new equipment in December in a bid for a bigger share of the bitcoin mining market. Bitcoin miners weren\u2019t the only ones splurging: the world\u2019s largest crypto companies such as Coinbase, Circle and a16z, the crypto investing arm of venture capitalists Andreessen Horowitz, have started pouring funds towards electing pro-crypto politicians in election year. The Department of Justice stole headlines last month after successfully prosecuting FTX\u2019s former chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance\u2019s former chief executive Changpeng Zhao, a one-two blow that I\u2019m sure was the envy of Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler. Catch up on how the DoJ became crypto\u2019s top cop here. And finally, to bring you up to speed this week: stablecoin operator Circle confidentially filed for an IPO, just one day after the SEC controversially approved spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSoundbite of the week: Bitcoin ETFs are no endorsement of bitcoin\n\nGary Gensler\u2019s reluctance to approve spot bitcoin ETFs couldn\u2019t have been much clearer, as his statement accompanying the decision laid out.\n\nThat said, its chair did not shy away from sharing his view on the merit \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 behind America\u2019s latest ETF products.\n\nI\u2019d note that the underlying assets in the metals [exchange traded products] have consumer and industrial uses, while in contrast bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing. While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin [exchange traded product] shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\u201d\n\nData mining: Binance\u2019s uncertain future\n\nThe advent of spot bitcoin ETFs not only marks a new era, it also spells potential trouble for the existing crypto market.\n\nAt Binance, the world\u2019s largest exchange, combined monthly spot and derivatives volume have dropped sharply. In January last year it recorded total volumes of $1.7tn, according to CCData. By January 9 this year the exchange had traded roughly $200bn.\n\nOf course, Binance\u2019s multiple run-ins with US authorities since then should be taken into account, but it traded $2tn only in December.\n\nAn anomaly or the start of things to come? We shall see.\n\nFT Cryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford. Please send any thoughts and feedback to cryptofinance@ft.com."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs this week could be a turning point for cryptocurrency investing.\n\nArk Invest CEO and Chief Investment Officer Cathie Wood is behind one of the new ETFs. Her firm partnered with 21Shares to launch the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\"We really believe this is an important moment for us to help with the democratization of bitcoin access, giving more people access,\" Wood told \"ETF Edge\" on Monday.\n\nThe first-ever batch of spot ETFs began trading Thursday. Investor interest in bitcoin leading up to the historic ETF approvals has been on the upswing. As of Friday, the cryptocurrency is up more than 125% in the past 12 months.\n\nAs financial firms begin to get more exposure through the new instruments, Wood said, the impact on bitcoin prices will be noticeable.\n\n\"If institutions with trillions of dollars under management just put 0.2[%] or 0.5% in, that could really move the needle,\" Wood said.\n\nOphelia Snyder's firm 21.co is heavily involved in the cryptocurrency space. According to its website, the firm \"bridges traditional finance and decentralized finance for easy crypto access.\"\n\n\"It's also very much part of a new wave of disruptive technology,\" the firm's president and co-founder told \"ETF Edge.\"\n\nSnyder contended that bitcoin goes beyond being just a new asset class."

        "content": "Ever feel like you've arrived late to the Bitcoin (BTC -7.27%) party? Fear not, because the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just sent out a fresh batch of invites in the form of 11 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Bitcoin's real-time spot price.\n\nIt's like a buffet of Bitcoin investment options, and I've lined them all up for you right here. The handy table below is your personal menu, serving up the essential details: from the amount of digital dough they're managing on Day One as a Bitcoin ETF to the fees they'll charge for the pleasure of their company.\n\n11 Bitcoin ETFs by the numbers\n\nETF Name Ticker Assets Under Management (AUM) in Dollars Number of Bitcoin Under Management Annual Fee (Expense Ratio) Fee Waiver Details Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -5.76%) $28.6 billion 619,187 1.5% N/A VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL -5.85%) $75.2 million 1,629 0.25% N/A Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC -5.85%) $20 million 433 0.25% Waived until August 1, 2024 iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT -5.82%) $10.4 million 228 0.25% 0.12% for first 12 months or until $5 billion AUM Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB -5.69%) $10.3 million 223 0.21% Waived for first 6 months or until $1 billion AUM Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) $5.0 million 108 0.39% Waived in first 6 months for the first $5 billion AUM Hashdex Bitcoin ETF (DEFI -5.77%) $5.0 million 108 0.9% N/A Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB -5.80%) $2.5 million 54 0.2% Waived in first 6 months for the first $1 billion AUM Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC -5.73%) $2.7 million 58 0.29% N/A Wisdom Tree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW -5.92%) $2.4 million 52 0.3% Waived in first 6 months for the first $1 billion AUM Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR -5.71%) $523,000 11 0.25% Waived in first 3 months\n\nNow, most of these figures will probably change very quickly. Most of these funds are entirely new investment vehicles created from whole cloth after the SEC's long-awaited approval. Others have been around for a while.\n\nFor instance, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was founded in 2013, managing its Bitcoin holdings under a mutual fund structure for more than a decade. In 2021, the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, formerly known as the Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF, started basing its price on financial derivatives of the actual Bitcoin asset.\n\nEither way, I expect a rapid inflow of investor funds into these new or reformed ETF assets. Assets under management (AUM) should increase quickly in some funds and slower in others as buyers pick their favorite options. That being said, the snapshot above should be useful as a guide to the expense ratios, introductory fee-waiver policies, and potential scale of each Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhat's my next move?\n\nHaving reviewed the new options, I'm sorely tempted to move my existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust holdings into a different vehicle with lower fees. The 1.5% expense ratio suddenly feels cumbersome in a whole new way.\n\nThe Grayscale fund has recently traded significantly below the up-to-date value of its Bitcoin holdings, as investors worried about the lack of progress on its ETF conversion. That discount is gone now.\n\nI got what I wanted, and my investment thesis for Grayscale's Bitcoin fund played out as expected. It's nice to see things working out as planned, but the ETF approval also ended the main reason I didn't mind a stiff management fee as I built my Grayscale position between November 2022 and July 2023. With the 20/20 vision of hindsight, I feel good about picking up Grayscale shares in that period:\n\nETFs with expense ratios in the range of 0.2% to 0.3% should deliver roughly 1.3% stronger annual returns than the costly Grayscale fund for years to come. That works out to a 12.7% difference in 10 years or a 26.9% outperformance in two decades. It's not a game-changing upgrade, but I would hate to leave a double-digit long-term increase on the table.\n\nI'm particularly tempted by household names like the iShares series (a brand of the BlackRock financial services giant), the subject expertise and low fees at Bitwise, and the equally slim expenses in the offering from Cathie Wood's ARK firm.\n\nFeel free to take your time, dear reader\n\nI can't actually do anything for a few days after publishing these words, of course, so the Motley Fool's ironclad disclosure rules will give me some time to weigh these options and their benefits. And in a couple of days, the AUM texture of this table may have changed significantly. Investing is never boring, especially in the ever-changing cryptocurrency market.\n\nYou can jump in right away or follow my lead and give some thought to this influx of new assets before taking action. Only time will tell which course will deliver the best long-term returns, but looking both ways before you cross Wall Street is always a good idea in my book. Good luck, and be careful out there."

        "content": "ETF Investing Tools\n\nWhile the first day of spot bitcoin ETF trading appeared to be a rousing success with nearly $5 billion in the funds trading hands, big asset managers including Vanguard Group stayed on the sidelines and didn\u2019t allow investors access to the new products.\n\nAccording to different published reports, Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch, State Street Corp., UBS Group AG and Edward Jones either refused to permit trading of the new exchange-traded funds, allowed select customers to trade them, or said they were evaluating the situation. Charles Schwab Corp. allowed the spot bitcoin ETFs on its platform, and Robinhood Markets Inc. CEO Vlad Tenev said in a tweet that the company plans to list them \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs pulled in about $721 million in flows in their first day of trading yesterday, on top of $4.7 billion worth of the funds that traded. Their approval followed more than a decade of wrangling between issuers and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which denied dozens of the funds tied to the new, digital currency because it was skeptical of issuers\u2019 ability to protect investors from fraud.\n\nSpot Bitcoin Not on Vanguard Platform\n\nWhile the SEC\u2019s view appeared to shift after losing a key court battle with Grayscale Investments, and as applicants promised security measures to safeguard investors, some asset managers continue to view digital currencies as inappropriate for most investors\u2019 portfolios. Vanguard said the funds \u201cdo not align with our offer focused on asset classes such as equities, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpot Bitcoin ETFs will not be available for purchase on the Vanguard platform,\u201d Vanguard said in a statement, adding that it continuously evaluates new products for inclusion. \u201cWe also have no plans to offer Vanguard Bitcoin ETFs or other crypto-related products.\u201d\n\nIn social media posts, users claiming to be Vanguard customers threatened to close their accounts. Those threats may be real and the company risks losing clients, Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, told etf.com in an interview.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cVanguard is taking a paternalistic position, imposing their judgement and viewpoint on their tens of millions of customers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact Vanguard calls bitcoin speculative does not provide legitimacy for them to not allow access.\u201d\n\nThe other so-called wirehouses are probably moving toward adding the ETFs to their lineups, and are proceeding through series of legal, sales and marketing steps in order to get them into their product lines, Edelman said.\n\n\u201cThe wirehouses are never first movers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a lot of laws and regulations they have to make sure they\u2019re conforming with, and they need to make sure their thousands of advisors know what they\u2019re\u2019 talking about.\u201d\n\nWith reporting by etf.com reporter Jeff Benjamin\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

Already, 11 bitcoin exchange-traded funds have begun trading in the US, including those from Fidelity, BlackRock, and Grayscale, among other firms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoldman Sachs was reportedly looking become an \"authorized participant\" in BlackRock and Grayscale's bitcoin ETFs at the beginning of the year, but the bank has advised its clients for years to skip adding cryptocurrencies into their investment portfolios.

The price of the cryptocurrency briefly topped $48,000 after the approval of the ETFs, though that momentum has since cooled off, with bitcoin trading around $45,749 Friday morning."

        "title": "Talk to your kids about their spot bitcoin ETF use - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs are known to make people happy, angry, perplexed, nonchalant, cynical, disdainful, curmudgeonly and hucksterish. Now that these products are legal in the US for adults to use, we need a frank and honest conversation about responsibility.\n\nFirst, the recap: one day after the SEC\u2019s comms hiccup and/or hack \u2014 and months after a court rebuke for previous denials \u2014 the US securities regulator approved listing 11 exchange-traded funds based on spot bitcoin. Previously it had only approved ETFs based on bitcoin futures, as the futures market has a defined regulatory regime (however dysfunctional).\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler published a statement Wednesday about the decision to approve Bitcoin ETFs:\n\nImportantly, today\u2019s Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin. It should in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities. Nor does the approval signal anything about the Commission\u2019s views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws. As I\u2019ve said in the past, and without prejudging any one crypto asset, the vast majority of crypto assets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws . . . Since 2004, this agency has had experience overseeing spot non-security commodity ETPs, such as those holding certain precious metals. That experience will be valuable in our oversight of spot bitcoin ETP trading. Though we\u2019re merit neutral, I\u2019d note that the underlying assets in the metals ETPs have consumer and industrial uses, while in contrast bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing. While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin. Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\n\nTo summarise the overall gist: sure, they\u2019ll approve spot bitcoin ETFs, but they won\u2019t be happy about it. And please do not even start with them about Ethereum ETFs right now.\n\nIn that spirit . . . readers, let\u2019s talk.\n\nSome of you will probably want to experiment with these products, maybe because your friends on TikTok say trading spot crypto will give you a rush and alter your state of mind. It\u2019s naive to think repeated warnings from authority figures of varying influence (Gary Gensler, Andrew Bailey, the FT editorial board, Unhedged, FT Alphaville) will keep you away.\n\nWhile you learn your limits, we\u2019d encourage you to experiment under the roof of the US securities regulator, through ETFs. And we want to make sure you have the information and resources to make thoughtful decisions about your cryptocurrency ETF use.\n\nCLICK HERE to find our full spreadsheet that\u2019ll be updated over time. For now, it includes information on the ETFs and their service providers. We\u2019ll add the first trading day\u2019s premium/discount to NAV when the data becomes available.\n\n(Note: Hashdex isn\u2019t included here because it hasn\u2019t yet converted its futures ETF to a spot ETF. It had to correct its own press release Thursday, saying it \u201cdoes not hold spot Bitcoin in its portfolio. At a later date, the fund will change its name and change its investment strategy to permit spot bitcoin in its portfolio,\u201d pending \u201ca registration statement that is currently under review\u201d with the SEC.)\n\nAnd here is a simpler table with the main details:\n\nWe should explain a few things in the spreadsheet itself.\n\nLike, what\u2019s the difference between the traditional ETF market-maker \u2014 the \u201cAuthorised Participant\u201d (AP) \u2014 and a \u201cLiquidity Provider\u201d? And what\u2019s the deal with the Coinbase lending agreements?\n\nThat \u201cliquidity provider\u201d category exists because APs aren\u2019t allowed to buy and sell bitcoin. (The SEC has not given explicit approval for broker-dealers to trade crypto, it seems.) So they\u2019ll have their APs making \u201ccash orders\u201d, with separate \u201cLiquidity Providers\u201d buying and selling the cryptocurrency on their behalf. It won\u2019t be necessary if or when regulators allow broker-dealers to trade bitcoin.\n\nSpeaking of middlemen, it\u2019s interesting that the initial bounce in Coinbase shares didn\u2019t last, because as far as we can tell, it has established a nice little business acting as a one-stop shop for ETF sponsors. It\u2019s a custodian for all but two of the ETFs above.\n\nMore notably, it\u2019s also acting as a prime broker and/or liquidity provider to many of the ETFs. Part of that service is also providing short-term loans to cover cash needs for creations or redemptions that may not be immediately covered by cash. (It isn\u2019t obvious how much of this will be needed if the SEC allows APs to trade bitcoin, so maybe that\u2019s behind the selloff?)\n\nFidelity\u2019s bitcoin ETF is also notable because it cuts out most of the middlemen and instead relies on its own specialised bitcoin benchmark and has a subsidiary to act as its own custodian. After all, as the other providers\u2019 somewhat elaborate trading arrangements show, holding bitcoin is far from free or easy (which from the investor\u2019s perspective is a big argument in favour of ETFs).\n\nAnd what about custody risk? Well it looks like Coinbase has worked out a system that\u2019s at least less risky than the FTX \u201cnot your keys not your coins\u201d model. To oversimplify a bit, it looks like Coinbase will keep coins in segregated accounts unless they\u2019re needed for liquidity, whether for creation/redemption or payment of fees. At that point Coinbase will transfer the bitcoin into a trading account; once that happens, they\u2019ll be pooled with its other clients\u2019 assets and the fund won\u2019t have a direct legal claim on them if something goes wrong.\n\nAnyway! To bring it back to our precious-metals ETF comparison, some providers might eventually decide to invest in derivatives that correlate spot bitcoin instead of worrying about holding the real thing, with all of its keys and hot and cold storage and whatnot. See the entire (fairly popular) category of gold-miner ETFs.\n\nSo it\u2019ll be fun to see what other types of creative price-replication structures bitcoin-tracking ETFs come up with. Anybody trading Texas power prices?\n\n. . .\n\nThat said, we will leave readers with one last request. Please, please don\u2019t post anything online while trading spot bitcoin ETFs. It makes the world less safe for everyone."

        "content": "Ever feel like you've arrived late to the Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) party? Fear not, because the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just sent out a fresh batch of invites in the form of 11 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Bitcoin's real-time spot price.\n\nIt's like a buffet of Bitcoin investment options, and I've lined them all up for you right here. The handy table below is your personal menu, serving up the essential details: from the amount of digital dough they're managing on Day One as a Bitcoin ETF to the fees they'll charge for the pleasure of their company.\n\n11 Bitcoin ETFs by the numbers\n\nETF Name Ticker Assets Under Management (AUM) in Dollars Number of Bitcoin Under Management Annual Fee (Expense Ratio) Fee Waiver Details Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC: GBTC) $28.6 billion 619,187 1.5% N/A VanEck Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: HODL) $75.2 million 1,629 0.25% N/A Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: FBTC) $20 million 433 0.25% Waived until August 1, 2024 iShares Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: IBIT) $10.4 million 228 0.25% 0.12% for first 12 months or until $5 billion AUM ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKB) $10.3 million 223 0.21% Waived for first 6 months or until $1 billion AUM Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: BTCO) $5.0 million 108 0.39% Waived in first 6 months for the first $5 billion AUM Hashdex Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: DEFI) $5.0 million 108 0.9% N/A Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: BITB) $2.5 million 54 0.2% Waived in first 6 months for the first $1 billion AUM Franklin Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: EZBC) $2.7 million 58 0.29% N/A Wisdom Tree Bitcoin Fund (NYSEMKT: BTCW) $2.4 million 52 0.3% Waived in first 6 months for the first $1 billion AUM Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (NYSEMKT: BRRR) $523,000 11 0.25% Waived in first 3 months\n\nThis data was collected from each ETF's official homepage on Jan. 11, 2024. Bitcoin was valued at $46,154 per token at the time of writing. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has actually moved from an over-the-counter listing to the New York Stock Exchange, but our publishing system treated it as an OTC ticker on Jan. 11.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, most of these figures will probably change very quickly. Most of these funds are entirely new investment vehicles created from whole cloth after the SEC's long-awaited approval. Others have been around for a while.\n\nFor instance, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was founded in 2013, managing its Bitcoin holdings under a mutual fund structure for more than a decade. In 2021, the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, formerly known as the Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF, started basing its price on financial derivatives of the actual Bitcoin asset.\n\nEither way, I expect a rapid inflow of investor funds into these new or reformed ETF assets. Assets under management (AUM) should increase quickly in some funds and slower in others as buyers pick their favorite options. That being said, the snapshot above should be useful as a guide to the expense ratios, introductory fee-waiver policies, and potential scale of each Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhat's my next move?\n\nHaving reviewed the new options, I'm sorely tempted to move my existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust holdings into a different vehicle with lower fees. The 1.5% expense ratio suddenly feels cumbersome in a whole new way.\n\nThe Grayscale fund has recently traded significantly below the up-to-date value of its Bitcoin holdings, as investors worried about the lack of progress on its ETF conversion. That discount is gone now.\n\nI got what I wanted, and my investment thesis for Grayscale's Bitcoin fund played out as expected. It's nice to see things working out as planned, but the ETF approval also ended the main reason I didn't mind a stiff management fee as I built my Grayscale position between November 2022 and July 2023. With the 20/20 vision of hindsight, I feel good about picking up Grayscale shares in that period:\n\nGBTC Discount or Premium to NAV Chart\n\nETFs with expense ratios in the range of 0.2% to 0.3% should deliver roughly 1.3% stronger annual returns than the costly Grayscale fund for years to come. That works out to a 12.7% difference in 10 years or a 26.9% outperformance in two decades. It's not a game-changing upgrade, but I would hate to leave a double-digit long-term increase on the table.\n\nI'm particularly tempted by household names like the iShares series (a brand of the BlackRock financial services giant), the subject expertise and low fees at Bitwise, and the equally slim expenses in the offering from Cathie Wood's ARK firm.\n\nFeel free to take your time, dear reader\n\nI can't actually do anything for a few days after publishing these words, of course, so the Motley Fool's ironclad disclosure rules will give me some time to weigh these options and their benefits. And in a couple of days, the AUM texture of this table may have changed significantly. Investing is never boring, especially in the ever-changing cryptocurrency market.\n\nYou can jump in right away or follow my lead and give some thought to this influx of new assets before taking action. Only time will tell which course will deliver the best long-term returns, but looking both ways before you cross Wall Street is always a good idea in my book. Good luck, and be careful out there.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC), consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs Are Here. Which One Should You Buy, If Any of Them? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It was more than a decade in the making, but spot Bitcoin (BTC -7.27%) ETFs are here.\n\nThe SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETF applications on Jan. 10 after the market closed, kicking off fierce competition for investor funds. Many of the issuers providing the ETFs are waiving their fees for a certain period to attract more investors up front. Still, with a wide array of options, investors need to know what's available and which of the new Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) they should buy, if any.\n\nHere's what investors need to know.\n\nMeet the new class of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe 11 Bitcoin ETFs come from a range of familiar names in both the traditional finance industry and the crypto industry. The blend of asset managers makes for a very interesting group.\n\nThe table below details the ETFs, their expense ratios, and their introductory fee waivers.\n\nName Expense Ratio Fee Waiver Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT:BITB) 0.20% 0% for first six months for up to $1 billion in assets ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ARKB -5.69% ) 0.21% 0% for first 6 months for up to $1 billion in assets Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (NYSEMKT:FBTC) 0.25% 0% through July 31, 2024 Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund BRRR -5.71% ) 0.25% 0% for first three months iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) 0.25% 0.12% for first 12 months for up to $5 billion in assets VanEck Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT:HODL) 0.25% None Franklin Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: EZBC) 0.29% None Wisdomtree Bitcoin Trust BTCW -5.92% ) 0.30% 0% for first six months for up to $1 billion in assets Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF BTCO) 0.39% 0% for first six months for up to $5 billion in assets Hashdex Bitcoin ETF DEFI -5.77% ) 0.90% None Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC -5.76% ) 1.5% None\n\nThe last two entries in the table above have been around for a long time. The Hashdex Bitcoin ETF is converting from a Bitcoin futures ETF to a spot Bitcoin ETF. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is converting from a closed-end trust that owned Bitcoin tokens to a spot Bitcoin ETF. They get the advantage of keeping all their current assets under management, which allows them to maintain higher fees than the new entrants vying for new funds.\n\nAmong the new entrants, there have already been big moves to reduce their expense ratios and waive fees. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund initially filed with the SEC saying it'll charge 0.39% of assets under management. It's since been revised down to 0.25% with a fee waiver through July 2024. Valkyrie and ARK lowered their ETF fees from 0.80% to 0.25% and 0.21%, respectively, and offered generous waivers for early investors. There could still be a lot of movement as issuers jockey for position.\n\nWhich Bitcoin ETF should you buy, if any?\n\nAll of the above ETFs will function in effectively the same way. A few minor details may differ between them, but the overall mechanism of how they operate is identical. As such, a fund's expense ratio will be one of the biggest factors in deciding which fund is best for you.\n\nThat might make the Bitwise and ARK 21Shares ETFs most appealing with their 0.20% and 0.21% expense ratios, which are also waived for the first six months.\n\nBut investors shouldn't count out Fidelity or Blackrock's (BLK -2.08%) iShares. Both are massive investment managers who know how to attract assets to their funds. They have been very competitive with their fees on traditional ETFs. In the long run, they could end up offering better rates than smaller competitors. Since the current difference in rates between those funds and the market leaders is already quite small, it might make sense for investors who are planning to hold their Bitcoin ETFs for a long time to simply buy one of those funds today.\n\nBut owning a Bitcoin ETF won't be for everyone.\n\nThe biggest use of Bitcoin ETFs for individual investors will be in retirement accounts like IRAs. Investing directly in Bitcoin inside an IRA requires opening an expensive self-directed IRA and then opening an account at a cryptocurrency exchange for that IRA. It's far less expensive for someone who wants to buy Bitcoin in their retirement account to buy one of the newly issued ETFs.\n\nFor investors who simply want to buy Bitcoin in a taxable account, they may be better off buying the cryptocurrency directly from an exchange.\n\nThat said, it'll take some time for that strategy to pay off. Coinbase (COIN -7.17%), the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., charges up to 0.6% on orders on its platform. As such, investors may have to hold their Bitcoin for about three years to break even against the fees charged by the lowest-fee ETFs. While institutional investors managing funds for the ETF trusts will also have to pay to buy and sell Bitcoin, they get big discounts for bringing so much volume.\n\nAdditionally, there's a certain level of technical proficiency required to buy and hold Bitcoin securely. There's also a lot of convenience in being able to hold your Bitcoin exposure in the same account as the rest of your securities investments. That quality alone may be worth the fees for some investors.\n\nOverall, the new Bitcoin ETFs offer a low-cost and convenient way for many investors interested in Bitcoin to gain exposure to the crypto asset."

But we're way early, we're in the first inning,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, O'Leary said in a separate CoinDesk interview that bitcoin has the potential to triple in price by 2030, hitting $150,000-$250,000.\n\nBut he said Cathie Wood's bull case for bitcoin to reach $1.5 million by 2030 would only happen if there's an economic catastrophe.\n\n\"For bitcoin to appreciate that quickly to that price would mean that the US economy had somehow faltered in my view,\" he said. \"So no, I don't agree with that price point.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "title": "1 Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Now Before It Soars 1,000%, According to Wall Street Analysts - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency industry has been in turmoil for more than two years. It started with a rotation away from risk assets as recession fears rippled through the economy in late 2021. Then the collapse of the Terra blockchain ecosystem set in motion a series of bankruptcies and forced liquidations that dragged the market down even further.\n\nIn total, the value destruction exceeded $2 trillion when the market finally hit bottom. But Bitcoin (BTC -7.27%) brought the cryptocurrency market roaring back to life in recent months as two potential tailwinds caught investors' attention: the pending approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the reduction in Bitcoin mining rewards later this year.\n\nThe first catalyst has already come to fruition. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETF applications on Wednesday, including proposals from two of the three largest asset managers in the world, BlackRock and Fidelity. That could elicit a wave of interest among retail and institutional investors, and the resulting increase in demand could drive the price of Bitcoin higher.\n\nIndeed, certain Wall Street analysts expect Bitcoin to triple or quadruple in value by 2025, and another analyst believes Bitcoin could increase 10-fold in value during the next five years.\n\nThe approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs could boost demand\n\nThe SEC began approving Bitcoin futures ETFs in October 2021. Those products invest in futures contracts rather than the cryptocurrency itself, so they do not track its price exactly. Case in point, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF returned 39% in the past six months, but Bitcoin increased 54% during that time.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs will invest directly in Bitcoin and closely track its price. The appeal of such products is direct exposure to Bitcoin without the hassle of cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain wallets. Investors can simply buy shares of a spot Bitcoin ETF through existing brokerage accounts. That could boost demand among retail and institutional traders.\n\nTo add detail, Bitcoin's price is determined by supply and demand, but the only variable of consequence is demand because its total supply is fixed at 21 million coins, of which about 19.6 million have been created. So, if the accessibility provided by spot Bitcoin ETFs translates into greater demand among retail and institutional investors, the price of Bitcoin could soar in the coming months and years.\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts see that as a likely outcome -- especially in combination with the upcoming reduction in mining rewards -- given that reputable financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity are participating as ETF issuers. Indeed, Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani believes Bitcoin could hit $150,000 by 2025, implying 210% upside. Standard Chartered Bank analyst Geoff Kendrick says Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by 2025, implying 313% upside. And Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee says $500,000 is achievable by 2029, implying 1,000% upside.\n\nThe reduction in Bitcoin mining rewards could reduce selling pressure\n\nBitcoin mining rewards are cut in half every time 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain, which happens about once every four years. The next Bitcoin halving event will occur in April 2024. Analysts believe that will lead to a substantial reduction in selling pressure, simply because miners will see Bitcoin inflows fall by 50%, meaning they will only have half as much cryptocurrency to sell.\n\nTo quantify that, MicroStrategy former Chief Executive Officer Michael Saylor believes selling pressure will fall from $12 billion annually to $6 billion annually after Bitcoin mining rewards are cut in half in April. That reduction in selling pressure will be tantamount to an increase in demand, potentially pushing the price of Bitcoin higher.\n\nIndeed, Saylor predicted in 2022 that Bitcoin would reach $500,000 during the next decade, implying about 1,000% upside. However, he was more recently quoted as saying Bitcoin could hit $5 million at some point in the future. That implies 10,230% upside, a seemingly absurd figure. But there is a historical precedent for halving events driving the price of Bitcoin higher.\n\nThe chart below lists the dates of past halving events and it details the returns generated by Bitcoin during the subsequent two-year periods.\n\nBitcoin Halving Event Date Bitcoin Return (2 Years Later) 2012 2,964% 2016 922% 2020 348%\n\nHere's the bottom line: Two catalysts could send Bitcoin soaring in the coming months and years. That makes the present a good time to buy a small position. But investors should remember that cryptocurrency is a young, volatile, and risky asset class. Bitcoin has fallen by 45% or more four times in the past five years, and a similar retreat is possible (if not probable) at some time in the future."

Before that happens, however, bitcoin could see further pullbacks. \"[Thursday's] rejection at $48,000 is notable marking the March 2022 peak,\" Oppenheimer senior analyst Ari Wald told CNBC. \"I can't help but think a sell-the-news scenario is developing with the launch of the bitcoin ETFs \u2026 the reversal at resistance can be viewed as a contrarian signal to reduce.\" Hefty unrealized gains Many had expected the long-awaited bitcoin ETF approvals to be a sell-the-news event . Investors and miners have been sitting on high unrealized gains as the ETF narrative drove bitcoin up by more than 60% in the past three months. Bitcoin slid more than 5% on Friday to $43,858.23, according to Coin Metrics. The current support level is $43,000, according to Wald. BTC.CM= 1Y line Bitcoin's 1-year performance per Coin Metrics He said $40,000, a level bitcoin hasn't seen since early December, would be another potential stopping point. Julius de Kempenaer, a senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, is watching a slightly higher support level at $45,000. Wald also pointed to the daily relative strength index, a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements, which recently showed that a bitcoin pullback could be in sight. An RSI reading of 70 and higher indicates that an asset is overbought, while a reading of 30 suggests it's oversold. \"While bitcoin's price is coming off a new cycle high, RSI made a lower high and was unable to get above the 70 level,\" Wald said. \"We think this is another indication that price is due for a breather.\" New record could be in sight Both Wald and de Kempenaer said bitcoin's overall uptrend is still intact, however, and could carry the cryptocurrency to a new record this year. \"Once the resistance area near $48,000 gives way \u2026 that will free up the way for the continuation of the rally, and the all-time high area near $69,000 will certainly come into sight,\" de Kempenaer said. Bitcoin reached its all-time high near $69,000 in November 2021. Wolfe Research's Rob Ginsberg agreed. \"It is not yet overbought, so I could see it working higher into the heavy $48,000-$50,000 resistance zone in the near-term,\" Ginsberg said. \"Here is where the real work begins, but I would expect it to eventually break out following some digestion and backfilling.\" \"Once out,\" he added, \"November 2021 highs of $69,000 are in play.\""

        "content": "MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC Holding Worth More Than Company\u2019s Market Cap\n\nMicroStrategy, the data software firm known for its aggressive Bitcoin investment strategy, has faced headwinds in the New Year, with its stock price slipping more than 20% in January. This decline comes despite a 10% gain for Bitcoin in the same period.\n\nMicroStrategy's woes can be attributed to several factors, including the recent launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These ETFs provide investors with a more direct way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially reducing the appeal of MicroStrategy as a proxy investment.\n\nMicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings, currently valued at $8.7 billion, exceed the company's market capitalization, which stands at around $7.7 billion. This means that the company's Bitcoin is worth more than the actual business.\n\nAdding to MicroStrategy's challenges is the selling pressure from its former CEO, Michael Saylor, who plans to sell 315,000 company shares, valued at $170.5 million. Saylor has already sold 30,000 shares for $19.1 million, further weighing on the stock price.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin: 5 ways to add the popular cryptocurrency to your portfolio - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that\u2019s encountered some wild swings in its price since it was first introduced in 2009. It\u2019s been a roller coaster ride, especially in the last few years, and many traders have plunged into bitcoins, with some having made millions, while others have suffered great losses.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering this decentralized version of digital cash, you have a few different ways to buy bitcoins. You can buy them directly or indirectly from a few traditional brokers, as well as some newer upstarts. In fact, it\u2019s easier than ever to buy bitcoins, and you can likely do it at a lower commission than before too, since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024.\n\nHere are five ways to buy bitcoins and some key factors that you need to watch.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is one kind of digital currency or cryptocurrency, a way to pay for things that exists only virtually. The currency debuted in 2009 and really broke into mainstream consciousness in 2017 with its rapid rise that year. Coins are created, or \u201cmined,\u201d when computers that organize the currency process and legitimize transactions in the currency.\n\nBitcoin uses a decentralized network of computers to manage everything \u2014 a distributed ledger called a blockchain that tracks transactions in the currency. It\u2019s like a huge public record of every transaction that has taken place in the currency. And the network monitors everything, ensuring the currency\u2019s integrity and the ownership of bitcoins.\n\n5 ways to buy bitcoins\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to trade Bitcoin, the good news is that you now have several options. You do not even need to open a separate and specialized account to do so, since major brokers offer a way to buy them via ETFs. (Here are some of the top brokers for trading cryptocurrency.) Plus, some unexpected players \u2013 PayPal and Cash App for example \u2013 now allow U.S. residents to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nEach method below offers a different combination of cost, security and potential upside and downside.\n\nFinancial apps\n\nMany financial apps such as PayPal and Venmo now allow you to trade cryptocurrency.\n\nPayPal makes it tremendously easy to directly buy or sell bitcoins using the same app that you\u2019ve come to trust with your online payments. You\u2019ll pay $0.49 for trades involving less than $5, and the fees rise from there. Trades involving $200.01 \u2013 $1,000 cost 1.8 percent, while those above $1,000 come in at 1.5 percent. There\u2019s a spread markup on trades, but you won\u2019t pay a fee for holding cryptocurrency in your account, and you can trade as little as $1 at a time. Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are also tradable here, as is a newly created PayPal stablecoin.\n\nVenmo charges the same fees, since it\u2019s owned by PayPal.\n\nCrypto exchanges\n\nCrypto exchanges are another popular option for those looking to buy Bitcoin. Exchanges offer a few key advantages to traders. First, the best crypto exchanges offer among the lowest possible all-in costs for trading cryptocurrency. So they\u2019re a good bet if cost is your key objective. Second, many exchanges don\u2019t charge spread mark-ups, which are hidden fees built into the trading prices. Third, many exchanges offer wallets, allowing you to securely store your cryptocurrency.\n\nThe fees at various crypto exchanges can differ markedly, so it\u2019s worthwhile looking around to find which offers the best combination of price, crypto choice and service. Popular options include Binance, Crypto.com and Kraken.\n\nTrading apps\n\nYou can pick up a few bitcoins with no direct commission by using a trading app such as Webull or Robinhood, though you\u2019ll end up making up for it with a spread markup. These apps also allow you to purchase Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nRobinhood takes its best trick \u2013 no commissions \u2013 and applies it to cryptocurrency, but it does charge a spread markup, the exact cost of which it does not reveal. You\u2019ll be able to buy bitcoins directly, and will have access to other digital currencies, too, a feature that other brokers listed here don\u2019t offer. Of course, you\u2019ll be able to buy stocks, ETFs and options while you\u2019re on the easy-to-use platform, including Bitcoin ETFs. Read more on Robinhood.\n\nWebull lets you trade a handful of cryptos, including Bitcoin. You\u2019ll pay a spread markup of 1 percent on each transaction, however. You can also trade stocks, Bitcoin ETFs and options. Read more on Webull.\n\nTraditional brokers\n\nSome traditional brokers have also ventured into the cryptocurrency arena, including Interactive Brokers and TradeStation. And with the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, major brokers offer funds that let you buy the crypto, too.\n\nAt Interactive Brokers you\u2019ll be able to buy futures contracts on Bitcoin as well as trade the coin directly. The broker charges $5 per futures contract, which gives you exposure to five bitcoins. If you want to trade Bitcoin directly, you\u2019ll pay a competitive commission of 0.12-0.18 percent of your trade value, depending on your monthly volume. You\u2019ll also have access to Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Interactive Brokers provides a whole range of other tradable securities, giving you access to securities across the world. Read more on Interactive Brokers.\n\nBitcoin ATMs\n\nAnother option is to buy bitcoins directly through a Bitcoin ATM, though you\u2019re likely to pay much more in commissions than you would elsewhere. You\u2019ll be able to buy bitcoins and some ATMs will allow you to sell them, too, using cash or a debit card. But you may need a Bitcoin wallet to make the transaction. Commissions can be pricey, with some ATMs charging around 7 percent per transaction, while the fees at others may stretch into the teens.\n\nBuying Bitcoin: Here\u2019s what to watch for\n\nAs you\u2019re considering how to buy Bitcoin, you\u2019ll want to evaluate the following factors, since they should influence your choice of where to buy it or whether to ultimately avoid it altogether.\n\nOwnership. What do you want to own exactly? You can own Bitcoin directly (say, through an ETF) or a derivative such as a futures contract, which offers a return on the currency\u2019s movement.\n\nUpside/downside. Your potential gain is related directly to whether you own the currency directly or via futures contract. By owning Bitcoin directly, your profit increases by a dollar with every dollar increase in the currency. In contrast, with futures you can gain much more quickly without having to front as much capital. However, your downside is more limited by owning directly, while you can lose more money with futures.\n\nCost. Commissions can vary widely depending on how you purchase Bitcoin. Futures contracts get you a big piece of the action relatively cheaply, while some brokers may charge you several percent to buy directly. A few percent might not sound like a lot, but if you\u2019re trading in and out of the market, it will quickly eat away at your profits. In contrast, a Bitcoin ETF gets you in the game quickly with no direct commission and a low annual expense ratio, and it\u2019s simpler to trade that way, too.\n\nSecurity. One of the biggest concerns with any investment is making sure that it\u2019s secure. Some newer cryptocurrency players have had serious problems with security. For example, hackers stole about $570 million worth of Binance\u2019s BNB coin in 2022. More traditional brokers may offer better security because they\u2019ve been dealing with the issue for much longer. And with Bitcoin ETFs, the fund company manages security, making it an easy way to own the cryptocurrency.\n\nYou may also receive bitcoins as part of commercial transactions. Regardless of how you came by your coins, any transaction in the cryptocurrency is reportable to the IRS at tax time.\n\nWhat information is needed to purchase Bitcoin?\n\nWhen you open an account at a traditional brokerage or a crypto exchange, you\u2019ll need to provide basic personal information. Of course, you\u2019ll need to provide your name, but the firm will also require other data such as your Social Security number, your address, your phone number and your bank account number. You may also have to detail how much trading experience you have and how comfortable you are with trading, depending on the institution.\n\nThis information allows the firm to identify you and verify who you are. It\u2019s also vital during tax time when the broker or exchange prepares documents on your gains and losses, reports that you\u2019ll need to accurately file your taxes.\n\nIs Bitcoin an effective hedge against inflation?\n\nSome people think Bitcoin may be an effective way to protect yourself from inflation, or what\u2019s called an inflation hedge. A hedge is a kind of investment that offsets, partially or fully, the price move in another asset. So, an inflation hedge would protect you from inflation in some way.\n\nThere\u2019s little evidence to support the assertion that Bitcoin acts as an inflation hedge, experts say. Bitcoin has not existed long enough to have been through a major inflationary period, though it\u2019s been tested during the recent challenging macro environment. Bitcoin fell substantially in 2022, despite inflation rising to its highest level in decades.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not an effective hedge against the volatility of the stock market, either. Experts say that Bitcoin acts more like a risky tech stock or momentum stock, meaning that it rises when these stocks rise and falls when they fall. That\u2019s not the kind of thing you want from a hedge, which should perform the opposite of the asset being hedged, zigging when the market zags.\n\nWhere is the best place to store bitcoins?\n\nThe best place to store your bitcoins depends on what you intend to use them for. For example, if you plan on trading them, it may be best to keep them with the crypto exchange or broker where you do your trading, especially if you\u2019re trading frequently or in the near term. Like other ETFs, Bitcoin ETFs are held in your brokerage account.\n\nOthers may opt for a crypto wallet, if they\u2019re planning on spending the cryptocurrency or even just locking it down for safekeeping. A crypto wallet can hold and secure your cryptocurrency, though if you\u2019re taking custody of your assets, then it\u2019s your complete responsibility, and you could wind up losing your cryptocurrency if you\u2019re not careful.\n\nTwo popular options for this latter group include hot wallets and cold wallets.\n\nHot wallets\n\nA hot wallet allows your cryptocurrency to be used or moved around easily. Because your coins are secured by software rather than hardware and are still connected to the internet, they\u2019re less secure than cold wallets. But if you\u2019re using a wallet because you intend to use the cryptocurrency, it makes sense to go with a hot wallet. Hot wallets come in a few varieties:\n\nDesktop wallets: You can download wallet software to your computer and manage your crypto holdings from there. When you\u2019re done transacting, you can even take it offline, increasing your security.\n\nWeb wallets: This browser plug-in allows you to connect to the blockchain and make transactions quickly, but the internet connection makes it less secure.\n\nMobile wallets: You can use software on a mobile device if you\u2019re using crypto to pay or transact.\n\nSome providers of hot wallets also offer multiple types of hardware wallets, so you can use one software type across multiple devices.\n\nCold wallets\n\nA cold wallet is more valuable if you really want to lock down your cryptocurrency and make it nearly impervious. Cold wallets rely on hardware, a physical device, to secure your holdings, and it looks like a USB thumb drive. This can be disconnected from the internet, making your holdings very secure. When you\u2019re ready to transact, you can plug it in and conduct business.\n\nWhile more secure than a hot wallet, a cold wallet has other potential risks, including theft of the device, loss of the wallet and even loss of the password. So even cold wallets are not foolproof.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to purchase Bitcoin or other digital currencies as an investment, it\u2019s important to keep costs to a minimum. Given the novelty of the crypto market, many brokers would love to maximize their commissions (in contrast to the stock market where trading fees have gone to zero). Those fees eat into your profits, so look for a way to minimize those frictional costs. But the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs provides a cheaper and more secure way for traders to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile the price of Bitcoin has run high quickly, it still carries serious risks that make it not suitable for everyone. Those looking for conservative investments or who cannot afford to lose money should consider avoiding Bitcoin or trading only with an amount they are willing to lose."

        "content": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs Make Historic Debut, Trading Volume Tops $4.5B\n\nA new era for cryptocurrency investing began yesterday as the first spot Bitcoin ETFs made their long-awaited debut on U.S. markets. These new funds, which hold actual Bitcoin rather than Bitcoin futures, attracted intense investor interest right out of the gate.\n\nAccording to data aggregated from Yahoo Finance, the total trading volume for the 10 new Bitcoin spot ETFs exceeded $4.5 billion on day one. Leading the pack was the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which saw an eye-popping $2.3 billion in volume after being cleared to convert to an ETF format on Wednesday.\n\nComing in second place was the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. IBIT handled over $1 billion worth of trades during its first day, representing nearly a quarter of the combined spot Bitcoin ETF volume. Other top performers included Fidelity's spot Bitcoin offering and Hashdex\u2019s fund (Futures).\n\nCrypto market analysts say the influx of investment from these new vehicles could provide crucial long-term support.\n\nThe launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has been years in the making. Industry advocates hope these funds will give retail investors simpler access to the crypto markets while providing legitimacy and regulatory oversight.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Just before 2023 ended, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood sold all of the company's remaining Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) holdings. The firm's Next Generation Internet Fund (ARKW) sold 2.25 million shares of GBTC and used some of those holdings to purchase 4.32 million shares of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO).\n\nWhile both GBTC and BITO track the price of Bitcoin with futures, GBTC is slightly different from BITO in terms of its relationship with spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nIn its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Grayscale indicated that it would convert the futures-linked version of GBTC into a spot version of GBTC if its application is approved, which occurred on Jan. 10. This allows it to keep the same investment and ticker symbol while converting the underlying asset from Bitcoin futures into actual Bitcoins.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nHowever, this move from ARK has caused investors to second-guess Grayscale's plans.\n\nSome believe that ARK is cautious about GBTC's ability to convert from a futures ETF into a spot ETF. If this is the case, GBTC could be approved for the switch after the release of other prominent applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs. In this event, many investors could pull capital from GBTC and put it into other Bitcoin ETFs. This could cause GBTC to lose value.\n\nWood told Bloomberg Television that the trade was made \"out of an abundance of caution.\" Wood and ARK are not 100% certain that GBTC will be approved for the conversion, so they are looking to remove some risk before the potential for approvals.\n\nAdditional caution could be the result of a shakeup in the C suite for Grayscale's parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG). In late December, the founder and CEO of DCG resigned after a slew of ongoing legal issues. He was succeeded by DCG CFO Mark Shifke.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: The last-standing top crypto exchange without a major security breach offers what now?\n\nWhile ARK sold GBTC, it also bought BITO. This could be a result of its bullish stance on Bitcoin. If it wanted to retain exposure to Bitcoin before the approvals, BITO is the logical option. However, the move could also have been following ETF mandates, such as a certain amount of the fund has to be invested in crypto-related products.\n\nThe SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, the final date for a decision on ARK and 21Shares ETF application after several delays.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Cathie Wood Buys Bitcoin Futures ETF; SEC Approves 11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

That drove prices of various majors, such as ether (ETH) and Solana\u2019s SOL, up as much as 10% within hours.\n\nHowever, bitcoin reversed course as the initial euphoria wore off, and market observers stated the hundreds of millions in volumes driven by Grayscale\u2019s bitcoin ETF were likely driven by sellers .\n\nPrices fell to as low as $45,700, or the level before the ETFs started to trade, and have not broken above the $47,000 mark since late Thursday.\n\nThe Grayscale bitcoin ETF is an uplisting of Grayscale\u2019s now-defunct bitcoin trust product \u2013 which held a certain amount of spot bitcoin in each share and had traded at a holdings-to-share value discount for all of 2023.\n\nSuch a price whipsaw caused both long and short bitcoin futures traders to get liquidated amid the confusing price action.

        "content": "The approval of a Bitcoin (BTC -7.27%) ETF was supposed to bring billions of dollars into the crypto industry, but in typical fashion, investors bought the rumor and sold the news. As of 2:30 p.m. ET, Bitcoin is down 6.3% in the last 24 hours, and the selling accelerated early this morning.\n\nEthereum (ETH -7.36%) has rallied the last few days but dropped 3.7% between 10 a.m. ET and 2:30 p.m. ET. Dogecoin (DOGE -3.18%) plunged 3.9% in just the last few hours as well.\n\nBuy the rumor, sell the news\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF approval was months in the making, and when these ETFs were announced on Wednesday, Jan. 10, the market started to sell off. A lot of traders had bought in anticipation of the ETFs (buying the rumor) and then began selling when there was no longer a catalyst to count on in the future (sell the news).\n\nTo be fair, Bitcoin has been flat in the past week, Ethereum is up 10%, and Dogecoin is down just 0.4%. So there hasn't been a big move if you pull back a bit.\n\nI do think it's notable that Ethereum has gained as much as it has. The speculation trade has likely moved to the second-largest cryptocurrency, which could eventually be a popular ETF asset as well.\n\nTechnology takes it on the chin\n\nCryptocurrency doesn't trade in a vacuum, either. Over the last three years, cryptocurrency has traded with high-growth tech stocks, and they're having a terrible day.\n\nLayoffs at Cloudflare, Alphabet, Discord, and dozens of other companies are calling into question the growth we should expect for 2024. There's still a delayed realization in parts of the tech industry that growth is slowing and costs need to come under control if companies are going to be profitable.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily impact cryptocurrencies directly, but if cryptocurrencies trade with growth tech stocks, it's not surprising to see a sell-off.\n\nWhat we don't know matters most\n\nThe theory of the last few months in cryptocurrencies was that an ETF approval would bring new buyers into the crypto market, bringing billions of dollars with them. But will that be the case?\n\nIt seems to me that buying cryptocurrencies is easy enough for anyone who wanted to buy some over the last few years. An ETF may make it easier in some ways, but it also comes with fees that are unnecessary for cryptocurrencies you can hold in self-custody.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if cryptocurrencies continue to fall as the market realizes that new money isn't coming in as expected following ETF approvals. And there's no increased utilization of the blockchain for innovative purposes if assets are held in an ETF.\n\nThis week has been more volatile than even a normal week in crypto. Don't be surprised if that's the theme for the next few weeks as the market figures out who is buying crypto to hold and who was just speculating on ETF approvals. There may be more speculation going on than investors would like to think."

        "content": "Friday marks the second day of trading for the 11 recently approved spot bitcoin ETFs (BTC-USD), following the landmark green light from regulators on Wednesday. Leading issuers Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), and Fidelity Wise Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw more than $4 billion in volume change hands during the eagerly awaited first trading session.\n\nYahoo Finance's Bradley Smith and Seana Smith break down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: We're around just about 26 minutes into the second-trading day here for spot Bitcoin ETFs. So we certainly saw a lot of excitement surrounding the listing debut of these products yesterday. The US listed Bitcoin ETFs seeing more than $4 billion worth of shares traded with grayscale BlackRock fidelity.\n\nDominating the headlines. Dominating some of that market volume here yesterday. So we did see Bitcoin ETFs. I think it's fair to say, get off to a very solid, encouraging, monster start here for Wall Street.\n\nThere was an interesting development during yesterday's trading day. The fact that Vanguard saying that it will not offer spot Bitcoin funds on its platform. And I bring this up because this points to some of the uncertainty some of the volatility.\n\nSome of the fact that, to some extent, not all on Wall Street have confidence in this product, yet have confidence in crypto. The way it trains. The sustainability of what this is going to be like for individual investors.\n\nSo keeping that all in mind, I think that points to the fact that there's still lots of uncertainty surrounding the debut of these products. But, judging by the volume yesterday, there clearly is a demand for Bitcoin spot ETFs. What that demand looks like following this pent up debut? I think is really what investors need to keep on their radar next week.\n\nStory continues\n\nBRADLEY SMITH: And some of the largest fund managers that are getting involved within this move here. I was just taking a look. And any of our viewers can check out this particular historical data section on the Yahoo Finance platform. And even if you were to look up, say, GBTC.\n\nWhich, of course, we were just speaking with-- our own Julie Hyman was speaking with Michael Sonnenschein yesterday on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as they essentially were able to make that conversion following the SEC's approval. 56 million was the volume that we saw there. So, big pop on volume there.\n\nAlso, iShares that rang the opening bell at the NASDAQ. The iShares Bitcoin Trust. IBIT, I-B-I-T that saw 36 point-- or 37.6 million in volume. And then, additionally, we interviewed Valkyrie earlier this week as well. They saw a pop in volume on yesterday. So the larger question is, what is the long tail of some of that volume? Where do we start to average out at from here.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah, Valkyrie seeing about 9 million of shares exchanging hands yesterday. And really, what the read through of some of the numbers that you were just citing, some of the numbers here that we're seeing from the other Bitcoin products-- ETF products is what that's going to tell us about the winners and losers within this category.\n\nObviously, some are going to be at more of an advantage than others. A lot of that coming down to fees. So, of course, in terms of what investors favor here over the coming weeks. We'll be very telling about some of the opportunity here in the long term.\n\nWell, we are going to be diving deeper into this historic week it's been for Bitcoin with the spot ETF approvals. I got a guest coming up in the next hour. Sandy Kaul Franklin Templeton's Head Of Digital Asset Investor Advisory Services will be joining us next hour for more on her take of what this means for the broader crypto market. So we'll be bringing that to you in the next hour."

Bitcoin Miner outflow has hit a multiyear high as tens of thousands of Bitcoin worth more than a billion dollars have been sent to exchanges. Why is this happening? Well, according to crypto quant data, the majority of the Bitcoin has moved from mining company F two pool analyst, Bradley Park told Coindesk that the move is due to miners facing increased costs. Park pointed to the increased costs of F two pool moving to Ca Kazakhstan and the need to upgrade miners before the having which decreases the rewards for mining and thus the per machine yield. As the reason for the outflow, the next Bitcoin having is expected to take place in April 2024 and some analysts expect the price to catapult to as high as 100 and $60,000 after the event. That's a wrap for chart of the day. I'm Jen Sasi. We'll see you next time to unpack more of the data behind top news stories."

This development officially brings the largest cryptocurrency to the attention of a wider audience of investors, who can now gain exposure to Bitcoin through an ETF.\n\nBitcoin ETF inflows\n\nOn their initial trading day Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows exceeding $4.3 billion, establishing an unprecedented milestone for exchange-traded fund products. Blackrock Inc.'s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF attracted over $1 billion and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust experienced inflows surpassing $2 billion.\n\nInflation rises again\n\nThe Consumer Price Index increased to 3.4% in comparison to December 2022, up from November\u2019s 3.1% and exceeding the anticipated 3.2%. This unexpected increase in inflation may have significant implications for financial markets and Fed policies in the near future.\n\nMixed bank results\n\nJPMorgan posted robust earnings and raised its 2024 net interest income outlook but cautioned about economic risks. Bank of America saw a 10% revenue dip last quarter. Wells Fargo's 2023 profit rose by 9% due to higher interest rates but the bank anticipates lower revenue ahead.

        "title": "Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are Here. Should You Invest? - Morningstar Asia",
        "content": "More than 10 years after the first filing, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission finally approved a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. In fact, the SEC approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs, giving investors options right off the bat. Trading should start tomorrow, Jan. 11.\n\nWhich ETF will reign supreme is up for debate. But one thing is clear: Spot bitcoin ETFs are the best option on the fund market for bitcoin investors.\n\nWhat Is a Spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\n\u201cSpot bitcoin ETF\u201d is just the official name for an ETF that holds bitcoin. Performance of these ETFs should follow bitcoin prices closely, minus fees and the fund\u2019s trading costs.\n\nA spot price is the immediately available price of a security. Futures prices, on the other hand, represent prices at a future date. Stocks and bonds trade at spot prices (that is, current prices), while products like commodities trade at future prices (which allows buyers to lock in a specific price and complete the transaction at a future date).\n\nThe only reason we call the newly approved ETFs \u201cspot bitcoin\u201d is because bitcoin futures ETFs made their debut first. Bitcoin futures ETFs entered the market in October 2021. If a spot bitcoin ETF had been approved first, we may well have simply called them \u201cbitcoin ETFs.\u201d\n\nShould You Invest in Spot Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nInvestors don\u2019t need to take a stance on bitcoin. Fear of missing out is a poor investment strategy, and investors should only invest in these ETFs if they see value in doing so.\n\nBelow are a few considerations when deciding whether to invest in spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs Are a Better Option Than Alternatives\n\nFees\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision to approve multiple filings at the same time created fierce fee competition between issuers during the application process, which is good for investors. Lower fees and costs become paramount to attracting new assets, leading issuers to come to market with competitive fees.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs significantly undercut the exorbitant fees charged by current crypto funds. The range of Grayscale trusts currently charge 2%-3%, and the largest bitcoin futures ETF charges 0.95%, a far cry from the 0.20% price tag in Bitwise\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF filing.\n\nFutures Drag on Performance\n\nWhile the SEC dragged its feet on spot bitcoin ETFs, it approved the first bitcoin futures ETF more than two years ago. ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITO was the most heavily traded ETF debut ever. But as we said at that time, \u201cthese aren\u2019t the bitcoin ETFs you\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nBitcoin futures ETF investors pay an extra fee to roll from one futures contract to the next, something spot bitcoin ETFs don\u2019t need to worry about.\n\nNon-ETF Grantor Trusts Struggle to Track Net Asset Value\n\nGrantor trusts like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC benefited greatly from a lack of better options. GBTC was one of the few ways investors could get exposure to bitcoin without opening an account to trade on cryptocurrency exchanges. It launched in 2013, peaking at $40 billion in assets under management in 2021. That first-mover advantage netted Grayscale billions in fees, in part thanks to the alarmingly high 2% fee.\n\nThe problem for investors is that these grantor trusts operate more like closed-end funds. Adding and redeeming shares takes time and effort. Without the ability to easily regulate the size of the trust, managing supply and demand becomes a major issue. This wasn\u2019t a problem for GBTC holders when it traded at a premium\u2014Grayscale even stepped in to meet high demand by issuing more shares via private placement. But Grayscale\u2019s helping hand was nowhere to be found when GBTC began trading at a steep discount, leaving its investors to sell their shares for significantly less than their value.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs should track their net asset value much more closely than early bitcoin trusts, which makes them a safer option for investors. And shares can be created and redeemed every day, which should keep demand and supply in balance.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs Aren\u2019t as Efficient as Most ETFs\n\nAlthough spot bitcoin ETFs are overall a better option for investors than bitcoin future ETFs, they don\u2019t yet offer the efficiency that investors have come to expect from other ETFs.\n\nETFs have become hugely popular because of their tax efficiency and low costs. In-kind creations and redemptions allow ETF portfolio managers to limit trading and avoid realizing capital gains.\n\nMutual fund managers need to buy or sell holdings to meet inflows and outflows, or otherwise keep a cash buffer on hand. ETFs, conversely, avoid these costs by exchanging ETF shares for the underlying holdings rather than buying or selling them.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs won\u2019t benefit from these in-kind creations or redemptions (at least, not yet). The SEC only approved cash creations and redemptions, meaning the ETF will need to bear the costs of buying and selling bitcoin when ETF shares are created or redeemed. That means capital gains will be realized when selling profitable shares, leading to potentially sizable distributions at the end of strong years. Both trading costs and tax inefficiencies will eat away at the edges of spot bitcoin ETF performance. The extent of these costs remains to be seen. Investors on the fence of whether to buy a spot bitcoin ETF may prefer to stick with traditional ETFs until these inefficiencies are resolved.\n\nThe Unique Risks of Bitcoin\n\nThe average ETF investor likely hasn\u2019t experienced volatility like bitcoin.\n\nOver the past five years, bitcoin\u2019s standard deviation of returns is nearly 4 times that of the U.S. stock market, as proxied by the Morningstar US Market Index. That said, much of bitcoin\u2019s volatility was to the upside.\n\nBut that\u2019s not always the case. Bitcoin prices have had drawdowns of at least 45 percentage points four times in the past five years, and the current price remains 37 percentage points below all-time highs.\n\nRisks don\u2019t stop at price swings. There\u2019s little precedent for the myriad dangers facing bitcoin investors, such as the manipulation and fraud that have been rampant in cryptocurrencies. A bitcoin ETF doesn\u2019t directly inherit that past, but the price of bitcoin is connected to other potentially affected entities.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs are particularly exposed to counterparty risk regarding cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase COIN, which spot bitcoin ETF issuers rely on heavily.\n\nCoinbase is the named \u201cbitcoin custodian\u201d on most of the ETF filings, meaning Coinbase will be responsible for the security of all the private keys of bitcoin held by these ETFs. Coinbase is also likely the exchange where bitcoin trading will occur for the ETFs when creations and redemptions require it. And Coinbase is the entity responsible for surveillance-sharing agreements with the ETFs\u2019 listing exchanges\u2014an SEC mandate for a better line of sight into crypto markets where trading could affect ETF prices. Much relies on Coinbase\u2019s safe passage.\n\nBitcoin Is Difficult to Value\n\nBitcoin is a speculative investment. There is no fundamental reason why it is priced where it is today. It is at the whims of supply and demand, making future prices hard to predict.\n\nMy colleague, Madeline Hume, took a look at four valuation methodologies for pricing bitcoin. Her conclusion? Each is flawed in its own way, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be much appetite for improving them. Investors must understand that bitcoin prices, and therefore these ETFs, are untethered from a fundamental value. Don\u2019t buy these ETFs if that makes you uneasy.\n\nHow to Choose the Right Spot Bitcoin ETF for You\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs should all deliver the same thing: exposure to bitcoin. Physically holding bitcoin doesn\u2019t leave much room for issuers to carve out an edge.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean these ETFs are all equal. Investors can pick the best option for themselves by focusing on three fund criteria: fees, liquidity, and fund trading costs. Buy-and-hold investors should emphasize fees, those actively trading ETFs should focus on liquidity, and everyone should keep an eye on how trading costs affect performance.\n\nBuy-and-Hold Investors: Focus on Fees\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time several issuers have provided access to essentially the same strategy. Before fees, the returns of gold ETFs or S&P 500 trackers are nearly identical. Like those strategies, fees are likely to be the biggest differentiator between spot bitcoin ETFs\u2019 total returns.\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF is tagged with the lowest ongoing fee of 0.20%. But fees on ETFs from ARK, Fidelity, VanEck, and iShares all fall within 5 basis points of Bitwise\u2019s ETF. Issuers also made use of fee waivers to help attract assets out of the gates. Six bitcoin ETFs will launch with a 0.00% fee after waivers. Each waiver has its own limitations\u2014most last for six months and only apply to the first $1 billion to $5 billion in assets. Waivers are temporary; investors should focus on the long term and stick with one of the lowest-cost ETFs after the waiver periods end. This still leaves plenty of options.\n\nThe one outlier is Grayscale, whose proposed fee is currently 1.50%. Investors won\u2019t get anything in return for this higher fee. They should look elsewhere for their bitcoin exposure.\n\nThe impact of fees on performance will likely be dwarfed by bitcoin\u2019s volatility. But buy-and-hold investors would be leaving money on the table by settling for a more expensive ETF.\n\nActive ETF Traders: Prioritize Liquidity\n\nInvestors have their own costs to worry about. Frequent trading and large trades come with liquidity costs that can add up quickly. Buy-and-hold investors are far less exposed to liquidity risks than market makers and day traders. For those looking to actively trade spot bitcoin ETFs, liquidity costs can be broken into two parts: crossing the bid-ask spread and depth of liquidity.\n\nCrossing the bid-ask spread. Traders pay a cost each time they buy the offer or sell the bid. In theory, fair value exists somewhere in the middle of a given bid-ask spread, making the midpoint a good proxy. If two ETFs were worth the same price of $10.00, it would be cost effective to buy the offer of a $9.99 bid/$10.01 ask compared with a $9.95 bid/$10.05 ask.\n\nTraders pay a cost each time they buy the offer or sell the bid. In theory, fair value exists somewhere in the middle of a given bid-ask spread, making the midpoint a good proxy. If two ETFs were worth the same price of $10.00, it would be cost effective to buy the offer of a $9.99 bid/$10.01 ask compared with a $9.95 bid/$10.05 ask. Depth of liquidity . Investors are keen to find enough shares to buy or sell near the current price; otherwise, they will receive suboptimal prices when executing a large trade. Tighter bid-ask spreads often indicate deeper liquidity, meaning more shares available to buy or sell near the current price. This is critical for investors trading large chunks of shares at one time so that the market impact of their trading doesn\u2019t overly influence the price.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Investors: A Fund\u2019s Trading Costs\n\nThe SEC sapped spot bitcoin ETFs of their wrapper\u2019s superpowers by requiring cash creations and redemptions. As a result, the ETFs are responsible for trading bitcoin when shares are added or redeemed, leaving the fund and its investors to foot the bill for any trading costs. These include transaction costs, the cost of crossing the bid-ask spread, and market-impact costs.\n\nDifferences between issuers may be small. But this is a rare occurrence where an issuer with two ETFs to its name (Valkyrie) is competing directly with the world\u2019s largest asset manager (BlackRock). There could be an advantage for issuers with deeper resources and capital markets experience and expertise. Perhaps a deeper connection to the crypto community will benefit an issuer like Bitwise or VanEck.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the different ETF options coming to market:"

        "content": "Securities and Exchanges Commission approves first Bitcoin exchange traded funds\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted to allow investors to more easily buy and trade cryptocurrency, by allowing companies to sell spot exchange-traded funds made up of cryptocurrency Bitcoin, the same vehicles used to sell stocks and bonds, to investors. The SEC approved eleven firms\u2019 applications for Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Grayscale Investments, among others. The SEC had previously refused to approve Bitcoin ETFs, saying that they were too risky and prone to fraud to be safe for most investors. At a CFR event moderated by CFR President Mike Froman in December 2023, Gensler said cryptocurrencies had \u201csome similarities to the 1920s\u2026 it\u2019s rife with fraud and manipulation.\u201d SEC chairman Gary Gensler said that the approvals were not a result of a change in the SEC\u2019s thinking on the safety of Bitcoin ETFs, but rather the consequence of a court case won by Grayscale Investments in August 2023 which said that spot Bitcoin ETFs were similar to another kind of already approved cryptocurrency ETF, Bitcoin futures ETFs. The SEC Twitter/X account announced the decision a day before the agency itself; however, the SEC quickly deleted the post and claimed its account had been hacked. The fake announcement caused a two thousand dollar spike in Bitcoin prices.\n\nRansomware attack hits Paraguay\u2019s largest telecommunications company\n\nTigo, Paraguay\u2019s largest telecommunications company, was hit by a ransomware attack on Thursday, January 4. The attack, launched by the ransomware gang BlackHunt, encrypted around three hundred servers maintained by the company. The attack reportedly affected several of Tigo\u2019s customers, including several government agencies, and the Paraguayan Army\u2019s cybersecurity team called on organizations in the country to work to harden their own networks and said that the attack was having a significant impact on the country\u2019s economy. The director of Paraguay\u2019s main civilian cybersecurity agency (CERT-PY) said that he hoped that Tigo was working with the FBI and U.S. National Security Agency on the hack, but that Tigo had been very secretive about its response to the incident. Tigo issued a statement denying the scope of the disruption, saying that \u201coutside of the specific services of the corporate segment cited, no internet, phone or wallet services have been affected.\u201d\n\nHuawei says it is ending lobbying efforts to undo U.S. ban\n\nChinese technology manufacturer Huawei said it is ending its efforts to lobby to reverse restrictions on its ability to sell telecommunications equipment and other products in the United States, according to a report from Bloomberg. Huawei\u2019s last two U.S. lobbyists, Jeff Hogg and Donald Morrissey, left the company in recent months, and it appears no replacements for them have been hired. Huawei faced growing efforts to restrict and ban its products over national security concerns between 2017 and 2022, with President Trump signing an executive order in 2019 prohibiting U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei and President Biden strengthening that stance in 2022 by preventing the import of any new Huawei telecommunications equipment. The U.S. government\u2019s push to restrict Huawei has expanded abroad as well, with Germany launching a review of Huawei and another Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, in March 2023.\n\nChinese research agency says it cracked Apple\u2019s AirDrop encryption\n\nNet Politics CFR experts investigate the impact of information and communication technologies on security, privacy, and international affairs. 2-4 times weekly.

AirDrop has been an important tool for protestors in China and Hong Kong to share information clandestinely, and was widely used in 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and to disseminate images of a protestor in Beijing holding a postercalling President Xi Jinping a \u201cdespotic dictator.\u201d Authorities have reportedly already used the breakthrough to identify and arrest people who shared documents via AirDrop at different protests. AirDrop has been a source of contention between Apple and the Chinese government, with Apple making a controversial change to AirDrop settings in November 2022 for iPhones in China by only allowing the \u201ceveryone\u201d sharing option for AirDrop to be turned on for ten minutes at a time.\n\nMeta adds restrictions on teens\u2019 use of Facebook and Instagram\n\nMeta, the parent company of social media platforms Facebook and Instagram, will place accounts of teenagers under eighteen years old in the most restrictive content setting, known as Sensitive Content Control in Instagram settings and Reduce in Facebook settings, in the coming weeks. Teenagers will not be able to opt out of the new settings, which will reduce the amount of sensitive content teens come across from people they don\u2019t follow. The changes will also automatically restrict content related to self-harm, which will not be shown to teens, even if it\u2019s from someone they follow. The changes will also introduce a recommended setting that restricts who can share content from teens and prevent users who don\u2019t follow teens from sending them messages. The new restrictions come as forty one states and the District of Columbia have sued Meta alleging that it built its products with addictive features that harm young users."

        "title": "Better Than BTC: 7 Crypto Stocks With the Potential to Outperform Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The crypto market is on fire this winter, with many cryptocurrencies seeing sharp rises as we start 2024 off strong. One of the biggest potential catalysts has been the SEC\u2019s approval of 12 Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETFs, finally giving the nod to these long-awaited investment vehicles. With the flood gates now opened, I expect to see many more Bitcoin ETFs launch this year, further propelling the leading cryptocurrency higher. In addition, Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event is approaching in 2024, reducing the new supply of coins on the market. Historically, these halvings lead to a supply shock that drives the Bitcoin price higher. And cyclical assets like Bitcoin could get an additional boost with rate cuts potentially on the horizon in the first half of 2024.\n\nWhile I always recommend holding some Bitcoin directly, buying shares of crypto stocks related to Bitcoin is another way to capitalize on this momentum and potentially see even bigger gains. These crypto mining stocks tend to trade more speculatively and have greater volatility than Bitcoin, as evidenced by the recent tumble. But their returns during crypto bull runs can be incredible for those with a higher risk tolerance. Let\u2019s take a look!\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT)\n\nIn this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) has very low production costs and a significant stash of BTC to benefit from future price spikes. If the crypto winter thaws more, RIOT stock has the potential to deliver much higher gains than Bitcoin itself. One of the reasons for this is that the company mines Bitcoin at a cost of only $5,537 per coin, which is the lowest among publicly-traded miners. Therefore, if the price of Bitcoin increases next year, Riot\u2019s profit surge will be magnified due to the company\u2019s operating leverage.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRiot currently holds over 7,327 Bitcoin in its balance sheet, which makes it highly-sensitive to the token\u2019s value. The upcoming 2024 \u201chalving\u201d event, which reduces mining rewards to create scarcity, could potentially trigger a surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price. As far as pure-plays in crypto mining are concerned, Riot Platforms is my top choice for navigating market ups and downs. This Bitcoin miner has increased its production capacity and is well-positioned to benefit from future bull runs. In December, its monthly Bitcoin output rose by 12% to 619 coins.\n\nStory continues\n\nRiot Platforms aims to increase its hash rate even more. It has secured two major orders with MicroBT, one in June for over 33,000 next-gen miners and another for an additional 66,560 miners this month. The company is targeting over 100 EH/s in total.\n\nApart from benefiting from rising Bitcoin prices, Riot can also capture more mining market share. Despite Bitcoin sitting 29% below its record highs, Riot\u2019s cost to produce a single Bitcoin is approximately $5,500. With Bitcoin currently trading near $46,000, this miner\u2019s margins seem sustainable even if prices correct. However, if bullish momentum takes hold, Riot\u2019s profit potential could be massive.\n\nMarathon Digital (MARA)\n\nIn this photo illustration the Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) is another company that mines cryptocurrencies and is well-positioned to benefit from Bitcoin\u2019s long-term growth. Although Marathon\u2019s cost to produce each Bitcoin is higher than that of Riot, its recent growth cannot be ignored. In Q3 of 2023, Marathon mined 3,490 Bitcoins, a 467% year-over-year increase compared to the 616 coins mined the previous year, resulting in a net income of $64 million from Bitcoin revenue. The company then produced 1,853 BTC in December alone.\n\nDespite the company\u2019s higher mining costs, Marathon remains profitable, especially at Bitcoin\u2019s current price level. Notably, this profitability is expected to continue in 2024. Additionally, with Marathon expanding its network hash rate, it is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of crypto mining overall.\n\nBitfarms (BITF)\n\nBitcoin and crypto mining farm. Big data center. High tech server computers at work. Bitfarms (BITF) mines crypto.\n\nSource: PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith Bitcoin surging recently amid several near-term catalysts, I\u2019ve become increasingly bullish on Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF). However This stock could take a breather soon as it has appreciated a lot.\n\nStill, I think the Canadian Bitcoin miner is not a bad buy below $3 per share. Bitfarms earned 446 BTC in December 2023 and 4,928 BTC for all of 2023. The company\u2019s hashrate also grew by 44% year-over-year, which exceeded guidance.\n\nGoing forward, the company hopes to achieve achieve 12 EH/s and 25 w/TH fleet efficiency in Q2 2024. Jeff Lucas, CFO of Bitfarms, said,\n\n\u201cIn 2024, we are building on our financial foundation with a continued focus on effectively utilizing cash flow from operations in our capital efficient growth plan for farm expansion and fleet-wide upgrades. Throughout 2023, we maintained a strong balance sheet during the fourth quarter, and we increased total liquidity by $52 million to $118 million, ending the year with $84 million in cash, $34 million in BTC in treasury, and only $4 million in debt. Furthermore, in December, we increased our overall BTC exposure by expanding our Synthetic HODL\u2122 portfolio by a total of 100 long-dated calls while maintaining BTC held in treasury relatively constant at 804.\u201d\n\nHive Blockchain (HIVE)\n\nBitcoin over a microprocessor in a motherboard. With copy space and selective focusing. 3d render banner illustration. Concept for crypto currency, mining, technology, investment, finance, crypto mining stocks\n\nSource: Gaston Cerliani / Shutterstock.com\n\nHive Blockchain (NASDAQ:HIVE) announced impressive 2023 calendar year production totals from its global Bitcoin mining operations. The company mined 3,260 Bitcoin in 2023 while doubling its hashrate from 2 EH/s to 4 EH/s.\n\nThis hashrate expansion allowed Hive to maintain approximately 1% share of the total Bitcoin network, mining around 9 coins daily on average throughout the year. With Bitcoin\u2019s daily block rewards averaging 900 and totaling 328,500 for 2023, Hive\u2019s output equated to a market share right around 1%.\n\nAs more efficient mining machines compete for limited daily rewards, Bitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty increased about 100% in 2023. But Hive expanded its hashrate enough to preserve its share. The company ended 2023 with around $17 million in cash and 1,704 Bitcoin held.\n\nHive aims to hold its full balance until April 2024\u2019s halving cuts daily rewards in half to 450 Bitcoin. If the price remains elevated by then, I believe Hive can easily remain profitable.\n\nThe company also made major progress deploying new mining hardware. Its full order of 9,800 Bitmain S19k Pro miners shipped, with 70% installed before January 2024. Once fully deployed, Hive forecasts a hash rate of 4.8 EH/s at 28.7 J/TH efficiency.\n\nCleanSpark (CLSK)\n\nMacro view of miner working for bitcoins mine pool. Devices and technology for mining cryptocurrency. Mining cryptocurrency concept. MARA stock. Crypto mining.\n\nSource: Yev_1234 / Shutterstock\n\nAfter pulling back recently, I think CleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK) stock retains significant upside potential. Last quarter, CleanSpark grew revenue by 100% year-over-year due to its expanding hash rate. The company posted $144 million in cash, also marking substantial growth. The company\u2019s production of more than 720 Bitcoin last month also took its total holdings above 3,000 BTC.\n\nThe company recently announced a major agreement to purchase up to 160,000 Bitmain S21 miners, positioning the company for up to 50 EH/s in hashing capacity.\n\nUnder the terms, CleanSpark will initially receive 60,000 S21 units shipping from April to June 2024. The deal also includes a strategic call option to acquire 100,000 additional S21 miners at a fixed $16 per terahash through the end of 2024.\n\nIf fully exercised, this option would boost CleanSpark\u2019s hashrate 400% from its current 10 EH/s to approximately 50 EH/s once all new machines are deployed. As one of North America\u2019s largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners, this move positions CleanSpark well to capture significant growth during the next crypto bull cycle.\n\nIris Energy (IREN)\n\nCrypto mining machines\n\nIris Energy (NASDAQ:IREN) recently published its December operational update, highlighting impressive Bitcoin mining production numbers. With 4,123 Bitcoin mined in 2023, the company averaged a 5,576 PH/s hashrate in December while mining 399 Bitcoin in that month alone.\n\nDecember revenue reached $17.2 million, weighed down by electricity costs of $5.9 million. Importantly, Iris expanded self-mining capacity to 10 EH/s after acquiring 1.6 EH/s of new Bitmain T21 miners for $14/TH.\n\nThis 80 MW expansion at the company\u2019s Childress, Texas facility will be delivered progressively from January 2024 onward. The added T21 units will also improve Iris\u2019 overall fleet efficiency from 29.5 to 24.8 J/TH once installed.\n\nThe company\u2019s 10 EH/s growth was fully funded through Iris\u2019 targeted equity financing program. The company continues early works and procurement for the next 100 MW expansion at Childress, where an additional 500 MW is immediately available.\n\nAt the company\u2019s Canal Flats, Mackenzie, and Prince George sites in Canada, Iris continued mining at capacity, leveraging 100% renewable energy. Construction also progressed at Childress, with new data center buildings on track for deployment from Q1 2024.\n\nWith its December Bitcoin production, Iris mined a total of 4,123 coins in 2023. The company begins 2024 well-positioned for further growth, with plans to scale beyond 10 EH/s in the second half of the year. If crypto market conditions improve as hoped, Iris could substantially boost future output at lower costs.\n\nBit Digital (BTBT)\n\nBitcoin miners in large farm.

SOS Stock\n\nSource: Artie Medvedev / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a more under-the-radar crypto mining pick, Bit Digital (NASDAQ:BTBT) could surge from current levels near $3 a share if a bull market rally continues this year.\n\nThe company touts 99% carbon-free mining. It also runs over 44,000 miners, producing a 3.4 exahash rate at maximum capacity. To date, Bit Digital has earned 5,503 Bitcoins since its inception.\n\nBit Digital\u2019s profitability is closely tied to the price of Bitcoin. However, if Bitcoin experiences a significant surge in value, some experts believe that previously-struggling companies in the industry, such as Bit Digital, could make a comeback by 2025.\n\nPenny Stocks\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "title": "Bitwise Leads Day 1 Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin ETF - Coins\n\nIn an opening day of spot bitcoin ETF trading that underperformed expectations of some analysts, Bitwise Asset Management generated the most inflows.\n\nThe San Francisco-based crypto index fund manager generated $237.9 million in inflows, the most of the 11 products that opened for trading on Thursday, less than 24 hours after the Securities and Exchange Commission had approved them. In all, issuers generated about $721 million in inflows.\n\nThe Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund and iShares Bitcoin Trust ranked second and third, respectively, with $226.9 million and $111.6 million in inflows, respectively.\n\nStill, Bitwise and the other 10 issuers\u2019 debut seemed to underscore pent-up demand for the product that is based on the price of bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest digital asset by market capitalization. The SEC had rejected multiple applications over roughly a decade, including as recently as early 2023.\n\nIssuers generated approximately $4.7 billion in trading volume, far exceeding the $4 billion that analysts had been predicting.\n\n\u201cThe first day inflows were bit underwhelming considering the $4.7 billion of volume we saw on Thursday, but the data isn't complete so in the coming days we could\u2014and probably will\u2014see that number tick higher,\u201d wrote ETF.com analyst Sumit Roy.\n\nRoy added that \u201cthe flows suggest that a lot of the trading activity in bitcoin ETFs during the first day was short-term in nature,\u2019 and that longer-term bitcoin bulls are expecting \u201ctens, or in some cases, hundreds of billions of dollars worth of inflows for bitcoin ETFs over the next one to five years. Anything short of that would be a disappointment to them.\u201d\n\nBitwise Low Fees\n\nBitwise is not charging a fee for the first six months and will then the fee will be .20%, the second lowest among issuers. In a press release Thursday, the company\u2019s CEO Hunter Horsley said that the company was expecting \u201csignificant demand for bitcoin ETFs like BITB.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery year for the past six years, financial advisors have identified ETFs as their preferred way to help clients access bitcoin,\u201d he said\n\nStory continues\n\nArk21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and Franklin Bitcoin ETF ranked fourth and fifth in inflows with $65.3 and $50.1, respectively.\n\n\u201cCongrats to $BITB for winning Day One of the Cointucky Derby w/ $238m in flows. $FBTC,\u201d Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg wrote in a post on the social media platform X/Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "content": "The United States-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw substantial trading activity, with $4.6 billion worth of shares changing hands by Thursday afternoon, according to LSEG data. This followed the landmark approval by the US securities regulator on January 10, marking a significant moment for the cryptocurrency industry, testing the acceptance of digital assets as investments.\n\nEleven spot bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, commenced trading on January 11 morning, leading to a competitive battle for market share, Reuters reported. Notably, Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity dominated trading volumes, as indicated by LSEG data.\n\nAlso Read | TCS, Infosys Q3 Results: Here's how both stocks are likely to open today\n\nCaution Amid Strong Initial Trading Volumes\n\n\"Trading volumes have been relatively strong for new ETF products,\" Todd Rosenbluth, strategist at VettaFi told the publication. However, he emphasised that this is a longer-term race beyond a single day's trading.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval on January 10 came after a decade-long struggle with the crypto industry. Despite the green light, some executives warned of bitcoin's high-risk nature, and Vanguard, the largest mutual fund provider, stated it had no plans to offer the new spot bitcoin ETFs on its platform.\n\nAlso Read | TCS Q3 result: Tepid growth in revenue, profit to dividend announcement - here are 5 key highlights\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler clarified that the approvals were not an endorsement of Bitcoin, describing it as a \"speculative, volatile asset.\"\n\nMarket Impact and Fee Competition\n\nThe ETF launches led to a surge in bitcoin prices, reaching the highest level since December 2021. Bitcoin was last up 0.77 percent at $46,303, while the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether, rose 2.79 percent to $2597.95.\n\nIntense competition ensued among issuers, with some slashing fees below the industry standard. Fees on the new bitcoin ETFs range from 0.2-1.5 percent, and several firms offered to waive fees for a specific period or dollar volume of assets.\n\nEstimates for the potential inflow into spot bitcoin ETFs vary widely, with analysts projecting flows to surpass $10 billion in 2024 or potentially reaching $50 billion to $100 billion in 2023 alone, as per the report. However, some cautionary notes highlight the broader investment community's perception of cryptocurrencies as risky.\n\nAlso Read | World markets today: US stocks mixed after inflation data, crypto shares surge on spot Bitcoin ETF approval\n\nCryptocurrency-related stocks initially climbed but ended lower, with Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital dropping 15.8 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively. Bitcoin investor Microstrategy fell 5.2 percent, while Coinbase declined by 6.7 percent, the report said. In contrast, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, tracking bitcoin futures, gained 0.44 percent, it added.\n\nDespite scepticism, some anticipate the ETFs paving the way for more innovative crypto products, including spot ether ETFs. Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein expressed plans to file for a covered call ETF, allowing investors to generate income from options on its spot bitcoin product.\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "title": "Weekly: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Approved - Coinbase",
        "content": "Market View\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs in the US (8 of which are partnered with Coinbase) on January 10, 2024 \u2013 after extending its decision window to the furthest extent allowed by its regulatory framework. Predictably, the immediate impact of the announcement on BTC and ETH trading volumes (both spot and futures) across global centralized exchanges has been to the upside, with the daily average over the last few days rising to over US$170B, 3x higher than the $56B average per day in 4Q23. That said, as we go to publish, it\u2019s still difficult to disentangle how much of these volumes represent the net creation of new ETF shares.\n\nMeanwhile, in the last two days, open-interest-weighted funding rates on bitcoin perpetual futures climbed from around 10% annualized (longs paying shorts) to almost 20%, making leverage more expensive, though still below where we started the year (above 36%). Interestingly however, the total open interest on perps hasn\u2019t increased materially over the last week, hovering above $10B. Expectedly, the basis between CME futures and spot compressed given the anticipated fall in demand for traditional (term) futures, as more people pivot away from futures-based bitcoin ETFs. Also, we think this means more institutional players are closing their long positions, as the CME basis tends to reflect the premium this cohort is willing to pay for long bitcoin exposure.\n\nThe outstanding question remains: what will be the size of the net inflows that ETFs attract through their first day, week, month and year of launch. Ultimately, we think this will put more attention on the next ETF chapter, as the banks and broker-dealers (who manage over 80% of the assets in the wealth management industry) run the due diligence reviews needed to offer these products to their clients. That is, we suspect there will continue to be an outstanding pool of capital that will be unable to access these products until those processes are completed, which can take months. In the interim, we expect to see new financial products in lending and derivatives that may start to use regulated ETFs as their underlying.\n\nBeyond bitcoin\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that the ETF approval is not only having a significant effect on BTC performance but on ETH as well. In fact, ETH seems to be emerging as the bigger beneficiary of the SEC\u2019s decision, which reinforces the view we published in our 2024 Crypto Market Outlook that many market players overlooked ETH in 2H23 as they sought to capture alpha from altcoins further down the risk curve. Beyond ETH\u2019s potential undervaluation relative to BTC, we see two key reasons for this rally in ETH.\n\nFirst, the approval of spot BTC ETFs formalizes crypto as an asset class among institutional investors, and both bitcoin and ether are the two most popular cryptocurrencies in that asset class with nearly 80% of the total US$1.8T crypto market cap. To put it another way, ETH is a critical part of many market player benchmarks, so as more institutions enter this space, under-owning ETH potentially represents real career risk. Second, having spot BTC ETFs in the US also improves the odds for a spot ETH ETF, possibly as early as end-May 2024. Although the Cancun (Dencun) Fork in February may potentially represent the faster-approaching market catalyst, we suspect the evaluation of spot ETF applications in 2Q24 ultimately represents the more important driver for investor flows.\n\nOnchain: Ethereum gas limits\n\nSeparately, there has been a flurry of discussion around measures to reduce the base layer transaction costs on Ethereum, largely triggered by Vitalik Buterin\u2019s comments that he believes an increase of the gas limit to 40M (up 33% from the current 30M) would be reasonable today in line with computational growth from Moore\u2019s law. However, other Ethereum researchers pushed back on a fast release with some stating that EIP-4844 for Dencun effectively accomplishes the same, only that the additional blockspace would be reserved for layer-2 (L2) storage. Many in the community are also looking for better clarification on the concrete impacts that such an upgrade would have, with some highlighting risks on state size, sync times, history growth, and other knock on impacts to client diversity and more. That said, in our view there appears to be a constructive willingness to explore this topic further.\n\nHowever, widespread adoption for such a change would likely be after the Dencun release goes live on mainnet and the additional load is better studied. It is worth noting that such a change would not require a hard fork to the chain, but is a client and validator configuration change that needs to be adopted by the majority of the network \u2013 thus this change could be adopted independently from either the Dencun or Pectra upgrades."

        "content": "The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) moved 894 Bitcoin (BTC) (worth $41 million at the time of the transfer) to a Coinbase Prime deposit wallet on Jan. 12, according to data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence. The movement comes the day after the trust started to allow authorized participants to redeem Bitcoin. Some X (formerly Twitter) accounts speculated that GBTC redemptions were responsible for the downturn in Bitcoin\u2019s price, although the withdrawals have been small as a percentage of Grayscale\u2019s total assets so far.\n\nIn addition to the $41 million in outflows to Coinbase, another $119 million was sent to wallets with no previous history.\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust sending BTC to other wallets on Jan. 12. Source: Arkham Intelligence\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is often believed to be one of the largest single holders of Bitcoin in the world. In a Sept. 6 social media post, Arkham claimed that the trust held over $16 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. Current Arkham data estimates the trust\u2019s holdings at $27 billion, as the price of Bitcoin has risen over the past few months.\n\nShares of GBTC have been traded since 2013 but were not redeemable for Bitcoin until Jan. 11. Because of the irredeemability of the shares, they have often traded at a steep discount to their net asset value, or the value of the Bitcoin they represent. For example, in October, each share of the trust was worth 16% less than the amount of Bitcoin it represented.\n\nOn Jan. 12, the day after multiple Bitcoin ETFs began trading, Arkham Intelligence data showed that the trust sent 894 BTC to Coinbase in one transaction and another 2,607 BTC to other wallets in three other separate transactions. The amount sent to Coinbase represents $41 million in outflows, or approximately 0.15% of the Grayscale trust\u2019s total holdings, while the remaining outflows to other wallets represent an additional $119 million, or 0.44%.\n\nRelated: Grayscale court decision was key to Bitcoin ETF approval, says Gary Gensler\n\nOn the same day that these outflows occurred, Bitcoin\u2019s price went into a sudden downturn, falling from approximately $46,000 to slightly above $43,000 by 6:47 pm UTC. The fall resulted in the break of a strong line of support at $44,740.\n\nDespite the small amount of outflows shown by Arkham, some X users theorized that the downturn may have been caused by redemptions of GBTC shares, as holders of these shares finally got the chance to cash out. Pseudonymous crypto trader Fomocap posted an image of the falling Bitcoin price and remarked: \u201cPeople are selling $25b worth of GBTC, welcome to ETF.\u201d\n\nPeople are selling $25b worth of GBTC, welcome to ETF https://t.co/ojKOGxrfrr pic.twitter.com/TQjZH3fXzs \u2014 Fomocap (@fomocapdao) January 12, 2024\n\nNapatradamus made a similar claim, stating, \u201cLess than $1b out of $28b has been sent out so far gents,\u201d adding, \u201cLoooong way down.\u201d As evidence for their theory, Napatradamus posted a link to Arkham\u2019s page for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.\n\nRan Neuner, host of CNBC\u2019s Crypto Trader, agreed with the theory, posting to X that \u201cBitcoin Price is dumping as people are dumping their GBTC shares.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Price is dumping as people are dumping their GBTC shares.\n\n\n\nGBTC held $25bn+ worth of Bitcoin that has been locked up for years with no option to be sold. As soon as the redemption option opened, for the first time people are starting to exit - as they exit the Bitcoin\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EqHgpHyVdd \u2014 Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) January 12, 2024\n\nIn his post, Neuner warned that Bitcoin \u201ccould see some selling pressure for a while,\u201d as \u201c$25bn is a serious number and even if just 20% are redeemed, that is $5bn in sales on the market.\u201d\n\nGrayscale has never publicly stated its wallet addresses, so Arkham could be mistaken about which wallets belong to the trust, in which case the outflows could be larger or smaller than Arkham\u2019s data shows."

He adds \u201cit\u2019s like digital gold.\u201d With the ETFs being a ledger of the growing price of Bitcoin and being cross-border, these Spot Bitcoin ETFs are valuable investments. This coincides with the months of hype and efforts to push the SEC towards approving these products.\n\nAlso Read: How Much Bitcoin Does BlackRock\u2019s Spot ETF Hold?\n\nFink goes on to explain that Spot Bitcoin ETFs further legitimize Bitcoin as an asset. \u201cThe advent of the Bitcoin ETF is an example that we\u2019re legitimizing this asset class.\u201d The approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs is already paving the way for hype around other potential spot-crypto exchange traded funds.\n\nOther Spot Crypto ETFs On the Way?\n\nSource: CryptoSlate\n\nIn particular, some asset management firms have already filed applications for another spot ETF for a leading cryptocurrency, Ethereum. Following the landmark approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the spot Ethereum ETF path doesn\u2019t expect to be as tough as BTC was. While the SEC has made it clear that it still doesn\u2019t technically support Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the approval is a step towards more adoption of digital assets.\n\nSpeaking about BlackRock\u2019s other ETF applications, Larry Fink didn\u2019t deny an additional application for an XRP ETF. However, he said he couldn\u2019t answer that question, and that Gasparino \u201cwouldn\u2019t want him to.\u201d The firm already has a pending Ether ETF, which may also see approval in the future. However, it is clear that BlackRock and its CEO are forward thinking on the future of ETFs and cryptocurrency in market trading.\n\nAlso Read: BRICS: Bitcoin Emergence Could Help Ditch the US Dollar\n\nFurthermore, in the same interview, Fink says that after the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the US economy is stronger than most people think.

        "content": "Ether price gained 13.5% between Jan. 10 and Jan. 12, breaking above $2,650 for the first time since May 2022. The pivotal factor for the rally has been the spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund approval, although the leading cryptocurrency traded down 2% in the same period. Investors are now questioning if Ether (ETH) has what it takes to sustain its current $322 billion market capitalization.\n\nEther/USD vs. BTC/USD, SOL/USD, and BNB/USD. Source: TradingView\n\nIn the past 60 days, Ether price has gained 27%, outpacing Bitcoin\u2019s 24% positive move in the same period \u2014 quite a feat considering that the spot BTC approval was expected to catapult its price as it opens room for a whole new set of clients who could not acquire cryptocurrency directly. Furthermore, Bloomberg ETF analysts hold 70% odds of an Ethereum ETF approval by May, as opposed to their 95% chances for Bitcoin.\n\nBlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck and other asset managers expect the final U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission deadline on the spot Ethereum ETF decision by May 23, but given that Bitcoin already paved the way, some analysts believe the final answer might come sooner than anticipated. For instance, the SEC has intermediary deadlines in late January for some of the applicants.\n\nEthereum competitors have lost momentum\n\nGiven that Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETF approval had a dismal price impact, one should conclude that Ether\u2019s bullish momentum has been driven by other factors. For starters, Ethereum\u2019s direct competitors faced a correction after expressive rallies. BNB (BNB) declined 2% in the seven days leading up to Jan. 12, while SOL (SOL) dropped 3% in the same period.\n\nIn SOL\u2019s case, the bullish momentum faded after the extremely successful SPL token airdrops \u2014 including JITO, BONK and WIF \u2014 faced 40% and higher price corrections. Moreover, much of the decentralized applications (DApps) activity gain seemed to be concentrated on a handful of projects that had imminent token launches, which also faded after the respective snapshots. Consequently, investors\u2019 appetite for Solana\u2019s SOL token started to diminish.\n\nBNB faced impressive and unexpected 35.7% gains between Dec. 17 and 27, 2023, but the bullish momentum was not accompanied by network activity. In fact, in the seven days ending Jan. 12, BNB Chain\u2019s active DApp addresses declined by 61%, while the number of transactions plunged by 64%, according to DappRadar. As a comparison, Ethereum faced a 2.2% decline in active addresses and 0.3% fewer volumes in the same period.\n\nBlockchains ranked by 7-day DApps activity. Source: DappRadar\n\nRegardless of how the nonfungible token (NFT) markets are depressed relative to the 2021 peak, Ethereum\u2019s network remains the undisputed leader in value, including the leading collections \u2014 CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Pudgy Penguins and Azuki. In essence, those using Ethereum decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and top NFT assets are not worried about a $6.30 average transaction fee.\n\nEthereum staking and DApp activity remain resilient\n\nEther\u2019s price has also benefited from its 4.3% annualized staking reward and a slightly negative issuance rate. Almost 24% of the entire circulating ETH supply is locked up while participating in the network\u2019s validating process, which fuels investors\u2019 expectations toward its price. In comparison, Solana\u2019s adjusted staking reward is 0.8% due to its high SOL issuance rate.\n\nRelated: Spot Bitcoin ETF approved in the US\u2013What to expect next\n\nThe Ethereum network is expected to undergo a hard fork that would mark a significant advancement in its technological capabilities. Focused on increased data availability and reduced costs for rollup transactions, the \u201cDencun\u201d fork has its first testnet implementation scheduled for Jan. 17. Another anticipated improvement is account abstraction, which enables reduced transaction costs and secure social logins.\n\nEthereum\u2019s limited capacity to scale and implement privacy solutions in the base layer has been a constant source of criticism; thus, it makes sense to smooth the process of accessing its second layers in terms of user experience and costs. Therefore, Ether\u2019s rally above $2,600 has less relationship to the spot ETF approval than it meets the eye, as the network remains dominant in the smart contract industry.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Bitcoin Cash surges in this bull market and drives the rally closer to $300. The BTC price breaks above the $260 barrier and teases a high-momentum rally ready to reach new heights in 2024.\n\nBCH is making waves with a thrilling triangle breakout on the daily chart, signaling hot entry points for eager traders. Experts are buzzing about a potential moonshot in BCH prices, fueled by the upcoming 2024 Halving event and the electrifying prospects of a Bitcoin Spot ETF.\n\n\u201cWill Bitcoin Cash go up further?\u201d Is this the question playing on your mind? Or perhaps you\u2019re pondering, \u201cBitcoin Cash, is it a good investment?\u201d\n\nWe bring you our Bitcoin Cash price prediction for 2024-2030 to answer these questions. Our BCH price prediction for 2024-2030 covers technical analysis, on-chain analysis, and significant upgrades and partnerships that can prove bullish for Bitcoin cash.\n\nSo join us as we decode the possible BCH price prediction for future years.\n\nOverview\n\nCryptocurrency Bitcoin Cash Token BCH Price $ 410.25396479 -6.75% -6.75% Market Cap $ 8,069,200,618.5582 Trading Volume $ 1,070,410,021.9608 Circulating Supply 19,668,793.7500 All-time High $4,355.62 Dec 20, 2017 All-time Low $75.08 Dec 15, 2018 24 High $ 474.4000 24 Low $ 393.1000\n\nWhat\u2019s New With Bitcoin Cash (BCH)?\n\nBitcoin Cash is a P2P electronic money that aims to become sound global money.\n\nIt is a fork of Bitcoin and provides fast payments, micro fees, privacy, and a larger block size.\n\nThe recent surge raises the possibility of BCH\u2019s price reaching $435 by the end of 2024.\n\nThe Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) helps create new types of coins in the BCH system.\n\nThe fourth Bitcoin halving is expected to occur in April 2024, which could lead to an increase in the price of Bitcoin Cash.\n\nMore importantly, the SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin ETF is a crucial catalyst for further recovery.\n\nBCH Coin Price Prediction January 2024\n\nWith a bullish breakout of an ascending triangle in the daily chart, the BCH price is gaining momentum and sets a new uptrend in motion. Crossing the overhead resistance trendline, the Bitcoin Cash price challenges the overhead resistance at $300.\n\nHowever, the extreme supply at the crucial level and the ascending upward trendline lead to strong opposition. Hence, the higher price rejection warns of the possibility of channel formation.\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) just hit a hot streak, surging a cool 25% in just five days from a key support level at $232. This week\u2019s action has not only smashed through the $260 barrier but also shaped up into an impressive ascending triangle pattern.\n\nThe breakout rally is a sign that sideline traders should get involved and take on the overhead resistance at $300. Additionally, the spike in trading volume of 117% supports the rally and hints at an uptrend beyond $300.\n\nCurrently, the BCH price is trading at $293 with an intraday jump of 6.24% following last night\u2019s jump of 8.44%. Therefore, the uptrend shows a continuous increase in trend momentum and raises the possibility of a bull run in 2024\n\nConsidering the buyers regain momentum to cross the $260 mark, the uptrend will cross the $300 mark by the end of this month to reach $350. On the flip side, if the BCH price drops under the $225 mark, it may soon test the psychological mark of $250.\n\nBitcoin Cash Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) January 2024 $250 $300 $350\n\nBitcoin Cash Price Prediction 2024\n\nBitcoin Cash, often seen as Bitcoin\u2019s savvy cousin, is riding a wave of excitement in the crypto world. The trading volume is up, giving a solid boost to its price. And guess the green light for Bitcoin, Spot ETFs has sent BCH prices soaring, painting the market with green candles in a bullish breakout.\n\nThere\u2019s a buzz in the air as Bitcoin flirts with the $50K mark, and this momentum could be just the ticket for a Bitcoin Cash price jump in 2024. Similarly, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has recently shown a promising rise, close to hitting the $300 milestone with impressive growth.\n\nWith the green light for Bitcoin Spot ETFs, the crypto scene is buzzing, and Bitcoin\u2019s looking up. BCH, closely linked to Bitcoin, is also on the radar for a price hike post-ETF approval. The upcoming Bitcoin Halving event, coupled with potential rate cuts, could turbocharge this bull run.\n\nMeanwhile, in the technical charts, the long-term growth reflects a strong bullish journey for BCH\u2019s price trend. The overall uptrend with an improvement in investors\u2019 sentiment can drive the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) coin price to $435.51 by the end of 2024.\n\nHowever, on the flip side, the Bitcoin Cash price might bottom out at $250.\n\nBitcoin Cash Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2024 250 342 435.51\n\nBCH Price Prediction 2025\n\nThe year 2025 could signal growth for BCH, with prices potentially oscillating between a low of $592 and a high of $711.

        "title": "Gensler calls Bitcoin ETFs 'ironic' due to their centralized nature, responds to Warren - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "SEC Chair Gary Gensler said it is ironic that people call the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs a historical moment considering its centralized nature, which is the antithesis of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision.\n\nHe said:\n\n\u201cThink about the irony of those who say this week is historic. This [the approval] was about centralization and traditional means of finance.\u201d\n\nGensler made the statement during a CNBC \u201cSquawk Box\u201d interview on Jan. 12, where he delved into the reasons behind the SEC\u2019s approval and addressed some of the concerns raised by Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\nRespecting the courts\n\nGensler said that the SEC approved the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs due to the recent court decision in the regulator\u2019s lawsuit against Grayscale. The court ruled that the SEC did not have legitimate grounds to reject a spot Bitcoin ETF since it had approved products based on futures for the flagship cryptocurrency.\n\nGensler said that the SEC has the utmost respect for the law and will always follow the court\u2019s directives regarding regulation. He added that the approval of the ETFs does not equate to an endorsement of Bitcoin, and he continues to hold a critical stance toward the asset.\n\nAccording to the SEC chair:\n\n\u201cBitcoin itself we did not approve, we do not endorse. This is a product called an exchange-traded product that investors can invest in the underlying non-security commodity asset.\u201d\n\nHe added that Bitcoin remains a \u201cvolatile store of value\u201d that is not being used for any legitimate payments. However, he acknowledged that the underlying technology holds promise and that approving the ETFs was the \u201cmost sustainable path forward.\u201d\n\nGensler also clarified that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency it considers a non-security commodity, likening it to gold and silver-based products. He added that the regulator continues to hold the view that the majority of crypto tokens are securities.\n\nResponse to Warren\n\nGensler\u2019s remarks also touched upon Warren\u2019s criticism of the decision. The senator has been a vocal critic of the cryptocurrency market, arguing that the SEC\u2019s approval was legally and policy-wise erroneous.\n\nResponding to these concerns, Gensler expressed respect differing opinions but reaffirmed his commitment to following legal and court directives. He stated:\n\n\u201cWhile I understand and respect the concerns raised by Senator Warren, our decision is grounded in a rigorous consideration of the legal framework and the current financial realities.\u201d\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the SEC\u2019s decision, the approval of these Bitcoin ETFs signifies a potentially new era for cryptocurrency in the mainstream financial market.\n\nThe inaugural trading session following the approval witnessed significant activity, indicating strong investor interest and potentially paving the way for more widespread acceptance of digital assets.\n\nMentioned in this article"

While the United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved Hashdex\u2019s 19b-4 filing, which would allow its spot ETF product to be listed on U.S. stock exchanges, the SEC did not make its Form S-1 effective, meaning that Hashdex\u2019s \u201cDEFI\u201d fund is still only trading as a futures-based ETF. The company also issued a corrected statement noting the fund did not yet hold any spot Bitcoin in its portfolio.\n\nThe trading volume includes inflows and outflows and doesn\u2019t paint a full picture of how much of the day\u2019s trading activity was buying versus selling.\n\nSenior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas theorized that the vast majority of trading activity for GBTC was selling as investors rotated out of the fund into newer, lower-fee products, such as BlackRock\u2019s and Fidelity\u2019s respective ETFs. His colleague James Seyffart shared the same view.\n\nRe what all these dollars flying around means. For the 10 fresh ETFs volume = buying btc today. Clear cut.

        "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Tanks Another 8%, Scaramucci Blames Grayscale/FTX For This Rout - CoinGape",
        "content": "The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) continues to face selling pressure after the Bitcoin ETF approval. In the last few hours, the BTC price tanked by a further 8% slipping all the way to $42,500 levels, as of press time. Some market analysts have also called the Bitcoin ETF launch a failure.\n\nWhat\u2019s Behind the Bitcoin Price Rout?\n\nThe recent dip in Bitcoin prices, is partly due to substantial sales of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares, as noted by Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital. In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Scaramucci revealed an observed trend of significant Grayscale selling, pointing to holders converting their shares from a trust to an ETF format. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s recent approval of ETFs prompted many to shift to these lower-fee alternatives, resulting in sell-offs to realize losses.\n\nadvertisement\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust, with its inception in 2013, witnessed a record-breaking first-day turnover of $2.3 billion on Thursday, marking a historic moment for ETFs. Despite being a popular avenue for Bitcoin exposure, the trust\u2019s shareholders, facing losses, opted to move towards cost-effective alternatives. Following Bitcoin\u2019s surge to a two-year high above $49,000 on Thursday, the cryptocurrency faced a decline below $43,000 on Friday.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s managing director of research, Zach Pandl, however, has defended his company\u2019s position. He added that the sale of one Bitcoin product to acquire another should not have an impact on the Bitcoin price.\n\nThe shares of GBTC experienced a 5.2% decline, closing at $38.58 on Friday. While GBTC shares had an impressive 300% surge in the previous year, Bitcoin\u2019s increase during the same period was nearly 160%, showcasing the trust\u2019s significant role in Bitcoin investment strategies.\n\nFTX Also Behind the Bitcoin Selling?\n\nInterestingly, Scaramucci also pulls out an FTX angle behind the recent Bitcoin price selling. He added that the bankruptcy estate of FTX added to the cryptocurrency\u2019s downward pressure. FTX, once among the largest crypto exchanges, filed for bankruptcy in 2022 amidst a broader market crash, and the estate is currently liquidating substantial crypto assets.\n\nThis sell-off, coupled with the recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has contributed to heightened selling activity in the market. Scaramucci anticipates that the supply overhang, driven by FTX\u2019s bankruptcy estate selling, will likely conclude in the next six to eight trading days.\n\nAdditionally, he noted a noteworthy development regarding the Wall Street marketing of ETFs. A quiet period, during which Wall Street refrained from marketing these ETFs, is likely to conclude in approximately eight days. This signals a potential shift in dynamics as Wall Street begins actively promoting and marketing Bitcoin ETFs, introducing a new phase to the market landscape."

        "content": "Crypto evangelists, rejoice! The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a financial product that\u2019s been 10 years in the making, a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. After much ado, including the hacking of the SEC\u2019s X account, trading of the new asset began Thursday, effectively bridging the worlds of cryptocurrency and traditional finance.\n\nWhat\u2019s a spot bitcoin ETF? It is a fund that tracks the price of bitcoin, offering an alternative way to invest in the digital currency without setting up your own cryptocurrency wallet. Investors can buy and sell bitcoin ETFs the same way they\u2019d buy and sell other more traditional ETFs, though not without caveats. The ETFs may make it easier to get some bitcoin action, but it doesn\u2019t change the underlying risks associated with crypto investing, an industry rife with volatility and scams.\n\nCue the promotions: With almost a dozen companies jumping into the bitcoin ETF market at the same time, they\u2019ll be competing to attract customers. Many funds slashed or discounted the fees associated with buying in.\n\nWill 2024 be the year of the bitcoin bull? Many insiders and analysts predict yes, and the launch of the ETFs only one reason. The next \u201dbitcoin halving\u201d is likely to occur in April, which will cut the rewards that bitcoin miners receive for producing new tokens. That should put the squeeze on bitcoin supply, which is finite. (About 19.6 million bitcoins exist of the 21 million issued in 2009.) We\u2019ll have to wait to see whether the bitcoin rally persists or the currency\u2019s fortunes, and the ETF hype, go the way of meme stocks.\n\nSmart in a Shot\n\nGetty Images\n\nGadgetpalooza has taken over Las Vegas. More than 4,000 exhibitors set up shop at the annual Consumer Electronics Show this week to show off the latest and greatest technology that\u2019s likely to arrive in 2024. Unsurprisingly, there\u2019s a lot of buzz around artificial intelligence.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago that virtual reality held our imaginations. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s plans for virtual reality haven\u2019t panned out, but many companies have moved forward with their own visions for the future of VR, including haptic tech and augmented reality smart glasses.\n\nSony also previewed a spatial reality headset, its answer to Apple\u2019s Vision Pro, which drops on Feb. 2 and will cost $3,500. Another company showed off a computer you both wear and can fit in your pocket.\n\n\u201cMarketplace Tech\u201d has been at the show all week. Learn more about the cool stuff being developed for cars and gadgets designed to improve your sleep.\n\nThe numbers\n\nHave you set any goals for 2024? We are almost halfway through January, but that might actually be the ideal time to set New Year\u2019s resolutions. Let\u2019s do the numbers.\n\n23%\n\nFor Americans who are setting resolutions this year, 23% say their priority will be saving more money.\n\n$500\n\nMore than half of people who made financial resolutions, according to a 2018 survey, spent $500 or more in \u201cresolution spending\u201d to help them achieve their goal. Writer Anne Helen Petersen warned her readers against \u201cthis ideology of self-improvement-through-consumption,\u201d opting for reflection rather than resolution.\n\n1 in 10\n\nThat\u2019s how many people actually achieve their annual goals. There are four core reasons people fail to keep them.\n\n15 minutes\n\nHere\u2019s how an economist applies the idea of marginal costs and benefits to make resolutions more achievable. Want to improve your fitness, for example? It might be that just 15 minutes more exercise a week is all you need for success!\n\nThe Marketplace team has some big and small financial resolutions for 2024! To hold ourselves accountable, we\u2019re sharing them with you:\n\nNone of us is as smart as all of us\n\nCalling all \u201cgood\u201d hackers\n\nEditor Stephanie Siek is reading a Rest of World story about so-called ethical hackers in Brazil who recover stolen social media accounts.

        "content": "The approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States has paved the way for Indians to explore investment opportunities in crypto assets.\n\nAccording to industry experts, this avenue not only provides investment options but also offers potential taxation benefits for Indian investors.\n\nIndian investors will now have the option to transfer funds internationally utilizing the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS).\n\nAlso read: US Bitcoin ETFs garnered $4.6 billion in trading volume after landmark SEC approval, competition for market share fierce\n\nIt's important to highlight that participation in foreign stock and ETF markets by Indian investors is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India's Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). Under this scheme, investors from India can allocate up to $250,000 for investments, including in US ETFs.\n\nNevertheless, according to the LRS guidelines, remittances explicitly for trading purposes in the US stock market or any other foreign market are strictly prohibited.\n\n\u201cFor Indian investors, the Bitcoin ETF will provide an opportunity to include crypto in their portfolio via the LRS route. Like any other asset class, Bitcoin ETFs also come with their own sets of advantages and disadvantages. An Indian investor taking exposure on Bitcoin ETF will get easy exposure through regulated entities without worrying about the storage of the cryptocurrency,\" said Viram Shah, CEO, Vested Finance.\n\nAlso read: Here\u2019s How the New Bitcoin ETFs Will Work\n\nShah further highlighted that 1% TDS on transactions will not be applicable since there is no actual crypto being purchased and capital gains tax will also be lower.\n\nOn other hand, the 20% TCS introduced in 2023 will be applicable on deposits above INR 7 Lakhs via LRS. Although, unlike TDS, it can be used to offset other tax liabilities but may lead to liquidity getting stuck. In addition, management fees for the ETF is an additional cost.\n\nOn January 10, the regulatory body overseeing the US capital markets granted approval for 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, including offerings from prominent financial institutions such as BlackRock, Vanguard, Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie, Fidelity, and Invesco.\n\nAlso read: Spot Bitcoin ETF: A paradigm shift in the world of cryptocurrencies? Here's what top industry experts make of the move\n\nSidharth Sogani, chief executive of cryptocurrency research firm Crebaco Global, said, \"Floodgates are now open (for) institutional investments (to) flow in\u2026We anticipate about $5 billion coming in (through ETFs) in the next 45 days. ETFs will bring more stability to the price of Bitcoin, since the liquidity risks will be reduced with time.\"\n\nThe landscape of India's cryptocurrency market underwent a substantial impact due to the taxation regulations implemented in the Union Budget 2022.

        "title": "SEC grudgingly approves bitcoin spot ETFs - OMFIF",
        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission has \u2013 after more than five years of spirited resistance \u2013 approved applications for spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s statement on the matter is not exactly gracious. Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, highlighted that the substance of the approved applications is similar to those the SEC has disapproved in the past. However, the US court of appeals said in August 2023 that the SEC had failed to adequately explain its reasoning in disapproving Grayscale\u2019s application. As a result, Gensler admitted somewhat sulkily, that \u2018the most sustainable path forward is to approve the listing and trading of these spot bitcoin ETP shares\u2019.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s resistance to allowing exchange-traded funds to be listed is based on their belief that the bitcoin market is subject to fraud and manipulation. The court of appeals\u2019 contention is not that the market is free from manipulation, but that, having approved bitcoin futures ETFs, its decision to disapprove bitcoin spot ETFs was unjustified.\n\nThis is hard to argue against. While bitcoin futures are securities traded on regulated exchanges (and therefore legitimate candidates to be represented as ETFs), their price is inextricably linked to the bitcoin spot price. Given that link, it is difficult to disallow one and not the other on the basis of price manipulation.\n\nIs it good for US investors?\n\nThe introduction of bitcoin spot ETPs should broaden the universe of investors that is able to get exposure to the performance of bitcoin. Is that a good thing?\n\nOn one hand, the returns are enviable. 10 years ago, bitcoin was worth $18.95. Five years ago, it was worth $11,174. At time of writing, it\u2019s $45,980. On the other hand, no one would attempt to claim that the bitcoin market is not, as the SEC contends, subject to manipulation.\n\nIn poetic timing, the day before the ETP approval was announced, the SEC\u2019s X (formerly Twitter) account was hacked and a false post claiming that the approval had taken place was published.\n\nIt is not clear that this post was an attempt at deliberate market manipulation. A far more obvious strategy would have been to short bitcoin, post that the SEC would never approve a bitcoin ETF, then buy bitcoin when the price dropped in anticipation of the upcoming announcement.\n\nWhether or not the hack was an attempt at market manipulation, it is indisputable that crypto markets suffer from malicious behaviour to a scale that would not be tolerated in regulated markets. Research referenced by SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw in her dissension from the approval found that wash trading on 29 centralised crypto exchanges averaged 70% of the total volume, while a Forbes study of 157 crypto exchanges suggested that 51% of the reported bitcoin trading volume was likely to be \u2018fake or non-economic\u2019.\n\nApproximately 0.01% of bitcoin holders control almost 60% of bitcoin\u2019s supply, according to research by Glassnode. That, combined with up to 10% of bitcoin that is irretrievably lost, means that bitcoin is a heavily concentrated asset. Accordingly, the ability for \u2018whales\u2019 to impact the price of bitcoin with malicious trading activity should not be overlooked.\n\nETF flows typically have a small impact on the price of the underlying asset, so the impact is likely to come in one direction. There is a risk that ETF buyers, many of whom will be retail investors or managing funds on their behalf, find themselves the victims of price manipulation by sophisticated investors in the underlying asset.\n\nIs it good for bitcoin?\n\nMany institutional investors, particularly in the wealth management community, are not permitted by their mandate to hold bitcoin directly but make heavy use of ETFs.\n\nJust how much this will mean for the bitcoin price is not yet clear. BlackRock and the handful of other successful applicants will, for the most part, be building up their ETFs from nothing in response to client demand. This buying pressure should be positive for bitcoin. However, with this decision being widely expected since the court of appeals\u2019 judgment in late August 2023, it is possible that much of this demand has been priced in by investors seeking to front-run the ETF demand.\n\nIt is also worth noting that there has already been an avenue \u2013 via bitcoin futures ETFs or via the shares of listed companies that strongly correlate with the price of bitcoin \u2013 to get listed exposure to the asset\u2019s performance. Spot bitcoin ETFs should be preferable though, since maintaining a rolling portfolio of futures is more complex and expensive than simply holding bitcoin and listed companies are exposed to other types of risk (such as key person risk) that does not affect bitcoin.\n\nThe vigour with which BlackRock and others have pursued approval for this product suggests that their market research indicates that there will be strong demand. It might also open up more flexible ways for regulated institutions to interact with bitcoin, via securities lending and options.\n\nIs it good for crypto?\n\nDespite the SEC\u2019s insistence that it remains \u2018merit neutral\u2019 on bitcoin, the approval of a bitcoin ETF will almost certainly lead to a more widespread exposure to the performance of the asset. It is less likely to improve the prospects of the rest of the cryptoasset market.\n\nGensler took the opportunity to reaffirm his belief that the \u2018vast majority of cryptoassets are investment contracts and thus subject to the federal securities laws\u2019. As such, registering any further cryptoasset ETFs will likely take a long time and a further legal battle. Incoming federal legislation might smooth this path if it determines that the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission has responsibility, rather than the SEC.\n\nThis may potentially clear the path for a much more interesting product. A fund could purchase a basket of the top 10 cryptoassets, then sell shares in the basket, offering investors exposure to the aggregated performance of the crypto market.\n\nIn the finance industry, many are starting to use blockchain technology to improve investors\u2019 access to traditional products using tokenisation. Efforts like these, if they deliver tangible use cases for the technology, will do more to advance the cause of cryptoasset promotion than offering non-DLT-based exposure to cryptoasset performance. In the long run, increased opportunities for exposure to bitcoin might improve appetite for other cryptoassets, but it\u2019s far from certain.\n\nLewis McLellan is Editor of the Digital Monetary Institute at OMFIF."

Nonetheless, BitMEX Research suggested that GBTC might face significant outflows in the coming days, weeks, and months due to its hefty 1.5% fee.\n\nETF Day 1 Flow \u2013 UPDATE\n\n\n\nFinally the GBTC number is out. GBTC has $95m of outflow\n\n\n\nTotal net flow for the day into the new ETFs was $625.8m\n\n\n\nBitwise was the victor for day 1 pic.twitter.com/HFsqhjtvEt \u2014 BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) January 12, 2024\n\nAs of the time of writing, other smaller players, including Hashdex and Valkyrie, were still waiting on precise data, while Fidelity had a solid second day, reeling in $195 million. BlackRock also reported a considerable $386 million inflow on the second day, taking its two-day total to nearly $500 million, which potentially places it in the lead.\n\nWhile these numbers are undoubtedly striking, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that today\u2019s actions in GBTC won\u2019t be reflected in the flow data until Tuesday night, reminding us that these numbers should capture Thursday\u2019s action.\n\nImp note, most of this flow data comes T+0 but cr/rd recording takes time to get into shares out regardless, hence why IBIT could see blob of money tonight. Also, GBTC is T+1 so NONE of the activity from yest will be reflected in flows till Fri at earliest and poss Tue night. \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 12, 2024\n\nAs the dust settles, it will be intriguing to see how these numbers evolve and shape the narrative of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nYou might also like: Grayscale moves $183m in BTC amid ETF fee competition\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF approval sparks cutthroat competition\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs this week, which included BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, has been a game-changer for the digital asset industry. This struggle has been ongoing for a decade in the race to attract investors.\n\nOne day after their approval, Bitcoin ETFs saw an impressive $4.6 billion in traded shares, marking a watershed moment in the cryptocurrency industry and pushing it closer to broader acceptance as a viable investment.\n\nHowever, this landmark approval also triggered a brutal battle for market dominance, with some firms cutting their fees below the U.S. ETF industry\u2019s standard even before the launch.\n\nAs a case in point, after its ETF started trading, Valkyrie reduced its fees twice, finally settling at 0.25%, and waived these charges for the first three months. Franklin Templeton slashed its bitcoin ETF fee to a yet-unseen low of 0.19% and waived fees entirely on the product\u2019s first $10 billion in assets until August.\n\nThe launch of these ETFs drove the price of Bitcoin (BTC) to its highest level since December 2021, with Bitcoin last standing at $46,303, marking an increase of 0.77%.\n\nAnalysts advise caution\n\nInvestors and market participants were keenly observing the price difference between buying and selling an ETF, commonly known as bid-ask spreads. ETFs with narrower spreads are typically considered more appealing.\n\nHowever, some traditional asset managers like Merrill Lynch and Vanguard have said they have no plans of allowing spot Bitcoin ETF trading, suggesting caution and reminding the crypto community that many still perceive cryptocurrencies as risky.\n\nDespite this cautiousness, several crypto asset managers who went all in on Bitcoin ETFs recorded impressive inflows on the first day of the product\u2019s listing. Bitwise, for instance, reported that $240 million flowed into its spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nFidelity and BlackRock received $227 million and $111.7 million, respectively. Franklin Templeton and 21 Shares registered inflows of $50.1 million and $65.3 million, respectively.\n\nValkyrie reported an inflow of $29.44 million on its first trading day alone, celebrating what CEO Leah Wald termed \u201ca successful trading day.\u201d\n\nRead more: Robinhood opens all 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs for trading\n\nFollow Us on Google News"
