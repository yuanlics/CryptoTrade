        "content": "Standard Chartered predicts bitcoin could fall to $5,000 in 2023 as part of its research on potential market surprises next year.\n\nThe reason behind the sharpness in the drop is unclear, although the move coincided with a Wall Street Journal report augmenting recent anxiety from investors around Binance. Specifically, CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao reportedly suggested in private conversation in 2019 that Binance affiliates had accounted for a portion of trading volume around the time it launched its U.S. trading arm. There are questions about whether this activity constituted \"wash trading\" aimed at inflating volume.\n\nBitcoin was last lower by more than 3% at $29,121.60, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it sank as low as $28,995.02, its lowest level in more than a month.\n\nThe price of bitcoin fell sharply and suddenly to start the week as investors awaited a major Federal Reserve policy decision and digested concerns around Binance.\n\nBinance is the largest crypto exchange in the world. It was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission last month and is at the center of a Department of Justice investigation that's likely to end with a consent decree or settlement, CNBC previously reported. Federal prosecutors have been weighing anti-money laundering violations and sanctions evasion charges, allegations that would make it difficult for Binance or founder Zhao to continue to get licenses to operate.\n\nNot everyone is convinced the big move could be put on the Binance story, however.\n\n\"You could probably chalk it up to technicals or flows,\" said Callie Cox, analyst at investing firm eToro. \"$30,000 is a big deal, and it makes sense that bitcoin investors are feeling more nervous around these levels. Recoveries aren't always a straight line up.\"\n\nElsewhere, investors are also watching what the Federal Reserve does at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\n\"Bitcoin is still fluctuating within a narrow range for a little more than a week, and it will likely continue to do so until the conclusion of this week's FOMC meeting,\" said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank. \"The market has almost fully priced in another 25 basis point rate hike by the Fed this week and is paying close attention to whether they are going to carry out another by the end of this year as FOMC's previous economic outlook suggested.\"\n\nRate increases helped pull bitcoin's price lower throughout 2022, which was already filled with several negative catalysts for the industry. Despite the recent resilience in bitcoin and rally in equities, recession concerns remain as traders weigh the lagged effect of rate hikes and recent signals of slowing in the economy.\n\n\"We have yet to see June's personal consumption expenditure \u2026 and they will not likely hasten to make the decision to halt rate hikes until they have more data and are more confident that inflation is coming down,\" Hasegawa added. \"This means that FOMC's rate decisions henceforth will likely continue to be 'live,' and bitcoin may not successfully break out of $31,500 for another while.\"\n\n\u2014CNBC's Rohan Goswami contributed reporting."

That increase, combined with the April 2024 halving set to slash daily mining rewards to $12 million, means the price of bitcoin would have to rise substantially to meet an equilibrium among buyers and sellers.\n\n\"This [bitcoin ETF launch] would bring daily demand to $125 million, while daily supply is only $25 million. The implied equilibrium price would need to rise so daily supply matches daily demand. Equilibrium analysis suggests that a clearing price is $140,000 to $180,000, before the April 2024 halvening,\" Fundstrat said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalving, also known as halvening, is seen as bullish for bitcoin, as cutting the reward given to miners in half is cap to limit the supply of bitcoins and has historically led to price increases.\n\nIn a note to clients earlier this month, Fundstrat's head of digital asset strategy, Sean Farrell, explained that a multiplier effect in the range of 4.0x to 5.0x is reasonable to assume for the bitcoin network.\n\n\"This means that $1 of demand can result in a $4 to $5 increase in market cap,\" Farrell said.\n\nFarrell sees a 75% probability that a spot bitcoin ETF is approved in the near term as a number of firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, await word from the SEC on their application filings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We anticipate [a bitcoin ETF] would attract new investors and generate increased demand for bitcoin,\" Farrell said.\n\nAnd if approved, a bitcoin ETF from BlackRock could lead to one of the biggest ETF launches on record, Fundstrat said, adding that it could ultimately break the record holder, the Invesco QQQ ETF, in its first year of inflows. The QQQ ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, attracted $36 billion in inflows in its first year following its March 1999 launch.\n\nFundstrat said bitcoin ETFs could eventually eclipse the precious metals ETF market, which holds nearly $230 billion in assets.\n\n\"Bitcoin ETF eventually could become >$300 billion category,\" Fundstrat said. And that surge in demand is what could help put a triple-digit price tag on bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFundstrat isn't the only firm with a $100,000+ price target for bitcoin. Earlier this month, Standard Chartered said a positive feedback-loop could propel the cryptocurrency past $120,000 next year."

        "title": "Bitcoin price is down, but data signals that $30K and above is the path of least resistance - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "On July 24, Bitcoin experienced a flash crash, plummeting to $29,000 in a movement now attributed to significant Bitcoin holders potentially liquidating their positions.\n\nAmid the crash and market uncertainty, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) three major trading metrics continue to project a bullish outlook, signifying that professional traders have not reduced their leverage longs through the use of margin and derivatives.\n\nAnalytics firm Glassnode reported a surge in whales\u2019 inflows to exchanges, reaching their highest level in over three years at 41% of the total BTC inflows. This forceful sell-off from whales alarmed investors, especially in the absence of any significant negative events impacting Bitcoin in the past month.\n\nNotably, a major concern stems from the ongoing court cases by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission against leading exchanges Binance and Coinbase. Still, there hasn\u2019t been any major advancement in those cases, which will likely take years to settle.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price crash might have been related to the U.S. dollar reversion\n\nDespite historical volatility, Bitcoin\u2019s crash became more pronounced following 33 consecutive days of trading within a tight 5.7% daily range. The movement is even more noteworthy given the S&P 500 gaining 0.4%, crude oil rising by 2.4% and the MSCI China stock market index surging by 2.2%.\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider that the world\u2019s largest global reserve asset, gold, experienced a dip of 0.5% on July 24. Furthermore, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) reversed its two-month-long trend of devaluation against competing fiat currencies, climbing from 99.7 to 101.4 between July 18 and July 24.\n\nU.S. Dollar Index (DXY). Source: TradingView\n\nThe DXY measures the strength of the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, including the British pound, the euro, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and others. If investors believe that the Federal Reserve will manage a soft landing successfully, it makes sense to reduce exposure to gold and Bitcoin while increasing positions in the stock market. Lower odds of a recession can positively impact corporate earnings.\n\nMargin and derivatives markets show resolute professional traders\n\nTo understand whether Bitcoin\u2019s price movement down to $29,000 has successfully ruptured the market structure, one should analyze margin and derivatives markets. Margin trading allows investors to leverage their positions by borrowing stablecoins and using the proceeds to buy more cryptocurrency.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe margin lending of OKX traders based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio rose between July 22 and July 24, suggesting that professional traders added leveraged long positions despite the recent price crash.\n\nTraders should corroborate this data with derivatives to ensure its marketwide impact. In healthy markets, BTC futures contracts typically trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium, known as contango, which is not exclusive to crypto.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nNotice how the indicator sustained a healthy 5.7% average annualized premium, slightly lower than two days prior but still within the neutral range. This data confirms the resilience of margin markets, but to gauge market sentiment further, it\u2019s also helpful to look at the options markets.\n\nThe 25% delta skew can reveal when arbitrage desks and market makers charge higher prices for protection against upside or downside movements. In short, a skew metric rising above 7% suggests traders anticipate a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price, while periods of excitement generally yield a -7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe 25% delta skew remained negative, indicating that bullish call options were trading at a premium compared to protective puts. This further supports the thesis that professional traders remain unfazed by the flash crash, with no evidence indicating pessimism among whales and market makers.\n\nThe path to $30,000 and above shows the least resistance\n\nIrrespective of the rationale behind the price move on July 24, Bitcoin bears could not dampen investor optimism, resulting in higher odds of a recovery above $30,000 in the short term. Notably, the mere appreciation of the U.S. dollar does not impact Bitcoin\u2019s predictable monetary policy, censorship resistance and autonomous nature as a means of payment.\n\nOn the brighter side, there are some positive triggers on the horizon, including the possible approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund and gaining regulatory clarity. Proof of this comes from a U.S. bill introduced on July 20 that seeks to establish a clear process for determining the classification of digital assets as commodities or securities. If the bill becomes law, it would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission authority over digital commodities.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Moreover, in the 2022 New York Governor\u2019s race (the closest one in decades), both Kathy Hochul and Lee Zeldin were asked during their first public debate to share their views on Bitcoin and Bitcoin data centers \u2013 a topic never raised in previous election years.

        "content": "Crypto markets aren't reacting the same way they once did to macroeconomic events. Consider the two most recent U.S. central bank interest rate hikes in May and March. They resulted in relatively mild price moves of 1.13% and -2.87%. The reaction to recent inflation and GDP data was similarly tame, with BTC moving just -0.74% and 1.16% respectively. All told, crypto markets have likely priced in Wednesday\u2019s anticipated move. More interesting for traders is BTC\u2019s price declining below the lower range of its Bollinger Bands, indicating that its price could move higher \u2013 albeit just slightly. Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator that tracks an asset\u2019s 20-day moving average, and plots price levels two standard deviations above and below the average. As an asset\u2019s price is expected to stay within two standard deviations of its average, 95% of the time, a breach of the external bands is statistically significant. Traders may be eyeing an upside target of $30,000 level, above the current support of $29,000."

        "content": "In this article, we will share Nouriel Roubini's Bitcoin views and other predictions. If you want to see more of his predictions, check out 5 Nouriel Roubini Predictions.\n\nHe sounded like a madman when he stood at a packed International Monetary Fund conference in 2006 and predicted a global economic recession. But he was a prophet when he returned to the same conference in 2007. Welcome to the world of Nouriel Roubini, a renowned economist born in Istanbul to a Jewish family that has been the center of many economic events that have shaped the world over the past 20 years.\n\nRoubini studied economics in Italy against his parents' expectations, as they expected him to continue the family legacy in the rug dealing business. As the black sheep of the family, he would go against the grain, going on to obtain a Ph.D. in international economics at Harvard University. A stint at Yale University as an economist lecturer would pave the way for him to take up a teaching position at New York University, bringing him to the global capital of all financial matters.\n\nIn a field with dozens of people giving analysis and predictions, Roubini has always stood out owing to his unusual approach to analyzing and predicting the economy. His model is not like any other, as it relies on intuition to predict what is likely to happen. Amid the successes in predicting how the global economy is expected to fare, he has also attracted criticism owing to his relentless prediction of disasters.\n\nHe is often referred to as Wall Street's Doom economist owing to his track record in predicting some of the biggest catastrophes that have engulfed the global economy. He first shone to light in 2006 as he accurately predicted the collapse of the U.S. market that would eventually trigger one of the biggest and most consequential financial crises.\n\nIn 2019, at the height of Donald Trump's presidency, he predicted that an escalating US-China trade war would escalate into a cold war and a currency war. Nothing could be further from the truth as the two countries are entangled in a vicious supremacy war around emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, critical minerals, and semiconductors. Likewise, China is spearheading the creation of a new currency to counter the dollar's edge as a global reserve currency.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoubini is also on record predicting that the COVID-19 pandemic would trigger greater depression than the 1930s depression. The pandemic ended up triggering significant supply chain pressures leading to a four-decade high inflation rate in several countries. While the U.S. economy has recovered, the prospect of another recession on the horizon is high.\n\nNouriel Roubini on Bitcoin and Other Predictions\n\nSource: pixabay\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, the U.S. Federal Reserve embarked on an interest rate cut frenzy to stimulate the economy. Cutting interest rates to near zero triggered heightened inflation as growth stagnated. As inflation levels rose to 30-year highs, Roubini warned that the FED would struggle to do what it needs to try to lower inflation levels without triggering a recession. That was the case as inflation rose to about 9.2% representing 40-year highs.\n\nWhile the FED did embark on an aggressive monetary policy tightening to try and bring inflation below the recommended 2% levels, Roubini has warned that the economy could be heeded to a deep recession. After an aggressive interest rate hike to above the 5% level, the supply of money was reduced significantly, with businesses needing help to access cheap capital needed to accelerate economic activity. Roubini believes the economy is headed toward a deep recession with those thinking of a mild recession are delusional.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nRoubini's accurate foresight of major economic events has cemented his position as one of the world's most prominent and reliable economists. In this article, we will explore Roubini's predictions over the years and what he believes the future will be all about amid the cryptocurrency revolution. This list reviewed Roubini\u2019s major predictions and their impact on the global economy. We ranked them chronologically from when the predictions were made. Let's delve into some of his most notable predictions and their impact on the global financial landscape.\n\n10. The Financial Crisis: 2007-2009\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis is arguably one of the biggest economic events that propelled Roubini to prominence. Two years before the global economy plunged into recession, the economist had warned of a potential housing bubble, excessive leverage, and risky financial practices. While at first, he seemed like a prophet of doom, his predictions materialized, affirming his status as one of the ears worth listening to on economic matters.\n\nAs early as 2005, the economist had warned that the housing market was in a bubble due to the low-interest rate environment and lax lending standards fueled by speculative demand. It's his prediction that the housing burst would spill into the financial sector that affirmed his predictions as 2009 saw the implosion of many financial institutions, including the Lehman brothers\n\nHis prediction that the financial crisis would severely impact the real economy came true as consumers and businesses were forced to cut spending as the U.S. economy plunged into recession in 2009.\n\n9. European Debt Crisis: 2010-2013\n\nRoubini was one of the first economists to call out the European debt crisis spearheaded by Greece, which eventually had a ripple effect on the entire economic block. As early as 2010, the economist warned that the Eurozone was storing many problems by failing to tackle the debt crisis head-on. He also warned that Greece was insolvent and not in any position to repay its debt without massive restructuring or bailout.\n\nThe New York-based economists had also warned that the debt crisis would spill to other European nations, mostly affecting Portugal, Italy, Ireland, and Spain; he termed the countries as some that faced massive problems with debt, low growth, and weak competitiveness.\n\nThe warnings came true as Greece defaulted on its debt obligations prompting a massive bailout. Greece, Portugal, and Ireland were also bailed out as they faced unsustainable debt levels. The E.U. was forced to thrash out a series of packages to ensure that Greece was funded through 2014.\n\n8. Chinese Economy Bubble Burst: 2011-2013\n\nRoubini once again shot into the limelight in 2011 as he warned that the Chinese economy faced a probability of a hard landing. The warning came amid concerns that the economy was highly dependent on U.S. consumers. At the time, the global economy was running on two engines, the U.S., on one part, as the consumer, and China, on the other hand, as the chief producer.\n\nWith the U.S. facing a collapse of consumption and consumer confidence amid plunging housing, auto sales, and durable goods spending, Roubini warned that China's economy was in big trouble. China being structurally dependent on exports at the time was a big problem, according to Roubini, who feared its hard landing amid waning consumption in the U.S. would end up impacting the global markets.\n\nThe economists had warned that the economy would face a hard landing in 2013. However, that did not materialize. While the Chinese economy has faced a number of issues over the years, it has managed to maintain high growth rates and stay afloat.\n\n7. Emerging Market Currency Crisis: 2013-2014\n\nAs the U.S. economy returned from the 2009 financial crisis, the federal reserve embarked on tightening monetary policy that included hiking interest rates. In 2013, Roubini warned that increased quantitative tightening and tapering by the FED would trigger significant issues for emerging market economies.\n\nThe prediction did come true as the tapering caused emerging markets to face capital outflows and currency depreciation as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the major currencies starting in 2014. The strengthening of the dollar put downward pressure on the exchange rates of emerging markets, especially those with large current account deficits and low foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAmid massive capital outflows, emerging market economies ended up struggling with lower growth and higher inflation. The countries faced higher import costs amid reduced purchasing power on weakened currencies and a stronger dollar.\n\n6. Oil Price Collapse 2014-2015\n\nAmid increased U.S. shale oil production and OPEC members failing to initiate any production cuts, Roubini warned of an imminent collapse in oil prices in 2014. Due to technological advancements, innovation, and efficiency gains, the U.S. shale oil companies ramped up production, consequently putting pressure on prices.\n\nOPEC, on the other hand, failed to stabilize the oil market through production cuts. Roubini warned of the long-term impact of Saudi Arabia's failure to cut its production quota in 2014 despite the falling process.\n\nThe result was the oil market experiencing its biggest price decline in modern history as oil prices fell more than 50% due to a glut in supply. Oil prices fell from above $70 a barrel to lows of $30 a barrel level. According to Roubini, the price decline was fueled by a slowdown in demand from major oil-importing countries, including China and India.\n\nRoubini's prediction did come true as the collapse of oil prices had a negative impact on the global economy as growth fell amid higher inflation and financial instability. The collapse also triggered a debt crisis in major oil-exporting countries, including Russia, Venezuela, and Nigeria.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Nouriel Roubini Predictions.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nDisclosure: None.

At the same time, strong inflows from institutional investors are also driving the demand for Bitcoin,\u201d Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co, the parent company of 21Shares, an issuer of crypto exchange-traded products, wrote to Forkast.\n\n\u201cAccording to K33 Research, BTC-equivalent exposure of exchange-traded products listed worldwide increased by 25,202 BTC (US$757 million) to 196,824 BTC in four weeks to July 16, which is the second highest in monthly net inflow.\u201d\n\nOctober 2021 was the highest month for net inflows into Bitcoin ETPs, following the launch of ProShares\u2019 Bitcoin Strategy ETF.\n\nFor a second consecutive day, Dogecoin was the only token up in the top 10 to gain, rising 2.5% in the past 24 hours to US$0.0768.\n\nSolana\u2019s Sol token was the day\u2019s biggest loser, falling 5.97% in the past 24 hours to US$23.10, followed by the XRP token that lost 5.32% to US$0.6833.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 0.38% to US$1.19 trillion while market volume increased 9.27% to US$25.15 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nForkast 500 NFT index falls to all-time low, Bitcoin, Ethereum NFT sales fall\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index slipped 0.68% to 2,656.79 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and fell 2.59% during the week. The index declined to an all-time low of 2,652.17 points earlier today.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales fell 5.82% to US$666,101 with the network shrinking to be the sixth largest blockchain by 24-hour NFT sales volume, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales fell 11.21% to US$11.69 million, while sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 17.68% to US$1.17 million even as Azuki sales declined 49.31% to US$547,373.\n\nOn Ethereum, CryptoPunks began to recover from last week\u2019s decline, rising 4.58% to US$633,772.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still an exceptionally slow time for NFTs, both with volume and sales. Global sales mirror what Ethereum\u2019s NFT sales were alone just a few months ago, during a time when NFTs were also considered slow.

Yet, the Shenzhen Component, the Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index all posted gains, after China\u2019s Politburo pledged to boost the mainland\u2019s economic recovery, with a focus on boosting domestic demand and assisting the property market.\n\nMost U.S. stock futures strengthened during Tuesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, except the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures. However, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures both strengthened.\n\nInvestors remained cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting on monetary policy later on Wednesday.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether fall as risk-aversion grows; Dogecoin gains on Twitter rebranding - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell on Tuesday morning in Asia along with most other leading cryptocurrencies as investors took a risk-averse approach on speculation the U.S. regulator will appeal a decision in the Ripple court case and the view the recent price gain on hopes for approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund got ahead of itself. The Federal Reserve also announces its interest rate decision on Wednesday and while a hike is priced in, for some investors it\u2019s another reason for caution. Gloom around China\u2019s economy didn\u2019t help. However, Dogecoin investors ignored these issues and the meme token gained after Twitter owner Elon Musk integrated its symbol into his Twitter bio on Monday as he rebrands the social media platform into \u201cX\u201d. Elsewhere, the Forkast 500 NFT index continued its slide and U.S. equity futures traded flat.\n\nLosing steam\n\nBitcoin fell 2.92% over the last 24 hours to US$29,182 as of 07:35 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly loss of 3.14%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency briefly traded below the US$29,000 mark on Monday evening for the first time in more than a month, or since June 21.\n\nEther dropped 1.98% to US$1,849 and moved down 3.25% for the week.\n\nWith the exception of Dogecoin, all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged losses, with Solana\u2019s SOL leading the decliners with a 5.31% drop to US$23.46. It has slumped 12.78% over the past seven days.\n\nThe price drops come as the bullish sentiment in the crypto market was offset by worries that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might file an appeal against the court ruling in the Ripple case, said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market-maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cRumours about CZ and the Binance [exchange] team potentially inflating some of their volumes,\u201d added to the caution, said d\u2019Anethan. \u201cWith investors always looking forward, the potential risks need to be accounted for and priced in.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Monday reported Changpeng Zhao, chief executive officer of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange Binance, hinted in an internal message that Binance affiliates conducted \u201cwash trading\u201d years ago, a practice where investors trade assets with themselves or an associate to inflate trading volumes and influence prices.\n\nBinance in an email response to Forkast News questions on Tuesday morning said: \u201cBinance does not engage in or tolerate wash trading, which is a violation of our terms of use, nor has it ever done so.\u201d\n\nThe comments, which were attributed to a Binance spokesperson who wasn\u2019t identified, added: \u201cBinance has a dedicated Market Surveillance team that is responsible for reviewing surveillance related to potential abusive and/or manipulative behavior including wash trades and trade price manipulation. The Market Surveillance team utilizes surveillance models and a team of experienced surveillance professionals to detect and prevent market abuse.\u201d\n\nDogecoin, meantime, gained 3.54% to US$0.07447 and moved up 6.66% for the week.\n\nTwitter owner Elon Musk changed the blue bird logo of Twitter to X on Monday and switched his Twitter location to \u201c\ud835\udd4f\u00d0\u201d, with \u201c\u00d0\u201d also used as a symbol for Dogecoin, raising speculation the meme token will be integrated into the rebranded social media platform.\n\nAmid the current selling pressure on most tokens, Matteo Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, sees signs for longer-term optimism.\n\n\u201cDespite a cautious attitude of investors in the short term, especially due to the rate hike expectations at the forthcoming FOMC meeting, the analysed metrics concerning BTC and ETH suggest a period of accumulation, with investors that are buying digital assets and holding for a long period looking for a price increase in the long run,\u201d said Greco in email comments.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 2.48% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume rose 40.26% to US$35.5 billion.\n\nForkast 500 drops, Bitcoin Ordinals hype fades\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.15% in the past 24 hours to 2,667.46 as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon NFT market indexes also moved lower, while the Cardano index gained.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume fell 4.49% in the past 24 hours to US$17.16 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Polygon and Bitcoin networks also fell, while Solana, BNB Chain and Cardano logged increases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still an exceptionally slow time for NFTs, both with volume and sales,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs. \u201cGlobal sales mirror what Ethereum\u2019s NFT sales were alone just a few months ago, during a time when NFTs were also considered slow. We just had no idea how much slower things could get.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Ordinals, an NFT iteration on the Bitcoin blockchain, has seen an even bigger slowdown. Uncategorized Ordinals, whose trading volume totaled over US$100 million in March 2023, has seen only US$18.61 million so far in July.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s ordinals ecosystem has suffered more than I was expecting, and that may be because trading BTC itself has taken priority,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cThe blockchain that was once being discussed as having potential to flip Ethereum\u2019s volume has now fallen to the 5th ranked blockchain by sales volume. This is where we see the chain\u2019s limitations and lack of smart contracts as hindering innovation, when innovation is really the only way to deliver value in this market.\u201d\n\nAmong all NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club topped the 24-hour trading volume, rising 60.61% to US$1.44 million.\n\nElsewhere, over 8,000 Stan Lee-themed NFTs have been \u201cnear instantaneously\u201d sold after their launch on July 18, according to a Tuesday announcement by the U.S. entertainment firm Kartoon Studios Inc. The studio issued the NFTs based on Lee \u2013 the famed comic book writer and co-creator of Spiderman and other Marvel Comic superheroes \u2013 in a partnership with VeVe Digital Collectibles.\n\nWith each NFT priced at US$15, sales of the Stan Lee NFT collection totaled about US$120,000, and showed there is still demand for certain assets despite the overall slow NFT market, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. The floor price of the collection currently sits at US$53, more than three times higher than the listing price, according to the trading platform of VeVe Digital Collectibles.\n\nDow on a streak, China not so\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, after all three major U.S. indexes closed higher in regular Monday trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average logging its longest winning streak in six years.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes were mostly higher on Tuesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved lower.\n\nStock markets in Hong Kong and mainland China found some optimism in a Politburo meeting on Monday, which signaled more support for the country\u2019s troubled property market and to boost consumption. However, the meeting did not unveil any specific large-scale stimulus to counter the country\u2019s slow post-Covid economic recovery.\n\n\u201cAt present, the main challenge facing the investment markets in mainland China is lagging consumer confidence, primarily influenced by the slower recovery of the domestic real estate market,\u201d Jason Yu, head of multi asset management at asset manager Schroders, said in an emailed comment on Monday.\n\n\u201cGiven that real estate investment constitutes a significant portion of the overall wealth of mainland China households, their caution towards spending and investing more is understandable when the future of the housing market looks uncertain,\u201d said Yu.\n\nIn the U.S. the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday to between 5.25% to 5.50%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. This will be the highest in 22 years, though the increase has been well signaled and priced in.\n\nEarnings are also in focus this week, with Microsoft, Alphabet and General Electric set to release second quarter results on Tuesday.\n\nOn the economic data front, the U.S. Composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to 52.0 in July, the lowest level in five months, according to a Monday report by S&P Global. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in business activities, while a reading below 50 a contraction.\n\nThe slowing in U.S. business activities in July could be seen as a positive by the Federal Reserve in its drive to curb inflation, Reuters reported on Tuesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "How bitcoin ATMs are revolutionizing the remittance industry - Vending Times",
        "content": "Bitcoin ATMs have emerged as a disruptive force in the remittance industry, revolutionizing the way cross-border transactions are conducted.\n\nThe remittance industry plays a vital role in facilitating the transfer of funds across borders, connecting individuals and families separated by vast distances. However, traditional remittance methods often come with high fees, lengthy processing times and a lack of transparency. Enter bitcoin ATMs, a disruptive technology that is revolutionizing the remittance industry.\n\nIn this article, we will explore how bitcoin ATMs are reshaping the remittance landscape, providing faster, cheaper and more secure cross-border transactions. We will delve into the technical aspects of bitcoin ATMs and their impact on the remittance industry, supported by references from the field of technology and information technology.\n\nChallenges of traditional remittance methods\n\nTraditional remittance methods, such as wire transfers or money transfer operators, have long been the go-to options for sending money across borders. However, these methods come with several challenges.\n\nFirst, they often involve high transaction fees, which can significantly reduce the amount of money received by the recipient. Second, the processing times for traditional remittances can be lengthy, causing delays in urgent financial matters. Third, the lack of transparency in traditional remittance systems can make it difficult to track the progress of a transfer or verify its authenticity.\n\nUnderstanding bitcoin ATMs\n\nBitcoin ATMs, also known as BTMs, are self-service kiosks that allow users to buy or sell bitcoin using cash or card payments. These machines provide a physical interface for individuals to interact with the bitcoin network and access the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin ATMs are connected to the internet and facilitate real-time transactions, converting fiat currency into Bitcoin or vice versa. The technical components of a bitcoin ATM typically include a secure vault, a cash dispenser, a touchscreen interface and a connection to the bitcoin blockchain network.\n\nBenefits of bitcoin ATMs\n\nFollowing are the benefits of bitcoin ATMs for remittance.\n\n1. Reduced costs. Bitcoin ATMs offer significant cost advantages over traditional remittance methods. By bypassing intermediaries and using the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin ATMs eliminate the need for expensive currency conversions and high transaction fees associated with traditional remittances. This translates into more money reaching the intended recipient, especially in regions where even a small reduction in fees can have a substantial impact on the recipient's livelihood.\n\n2. Faster transactions. Traditional remittance methods often involve complex processes and multiple intermediaries, resulting in delays in fund transfers. Bitcoin ATMs, on the other hand, enable near-instantaneous transactions, especially when sending bitcoin from one ATM to another. This speed of transfer can be particularly beneficial in urgent situations, such as emergencies or time-sensitive financial obligations.\n\n3. Enhanced transparency and security. Bitcoin ATMs leverage the transparency and security features of blockchain technology to provide a traceable and tamper-resistant record of transactions. Each transaction is recorded on the bitcoin blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability. Additionally, bitcoin ATMs employ various security measures, including encryption, biometric authentication and tamper-evident mechanisms to safeguard user transactions and funds.\n\nDisrupting the remittance industry\n\nFollowing are disruptive factors of bitcoin ATMs in the remittance industry.\n\n1. Financial Inclusion. Bitcoin ATMs have the potential to promote financial inclusion by providing access to digital currencies for individuals who are unbanked or underbanked. In regions where traditional banking services are limited, Bitcoin ATMs offer a gateway to the global financial system, allowing users to send and receive funds across borders without relying on traditional banking infrastructure.\n\n2. Remittance Innovation. Bitcoin ATMs are driving innovation in the remittance industry by challenging traditional models and introducing new ways of conducting cross-border transactions. The decentralized nature of bitcoin eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and streamlining the remittance process. Additionally, the use of blockchain technology ensures transaction transparency and enhances security, addressing the pain points of traditional remittance methods.\n\n3. Market disruption. Bitcoin ATMs are disrupting the remittance market by providing an alternative that offers lower fees, faster transactions and greater control over funds. As the adoption of bitcoin ATMs grows, traditional remittance providers may face increased competition, prompting them to reevaluate their business models and embrace new technologies to stay relevant in the evolving landscape.\n\nReal-world impact\n\nIn countries like Venezuela and Argentina, where hyperinflation and economic instability have led to a surge in cryptocurrency adoption, crypto ATMs have played a crucial role in enabling individuals to send and receive remittances from abroad. These machines have provided a lifeline for people who would otherwise struggle with limited access to traditional banking services.\n\nCountries like the Philippines and Thailand, which have a significant number of migrant workers sending remittances to their home countries, are experiencing the benefits of cryptocurrency ATMs. These machines offer a more cost-effective and efficient way for migrant workers to send money back to their families, bypassing traditional remittance channels and avoiding hefty fees.\n\nRegulatory considerations and outlook\n\nThe regulatory landscape for bitcoin ATMs in the remittance industry varies across jurisdictions. Governments and financial regulators are actively addressing the legal and compliance aspects of cryptocurrency transactions, including know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Striking a balance between consumer protection and fostering innovation will be crucial in shaping the future of bitcoin ATMs in the remittance industry.\n\nAs technology advances, we can expect further improvements in bitcoin ATM functionalities. Integration with mobile wallets, expanded support for additional cryptocurrencies and enhanced user interfaces are among the potential developments that will make bitcoin ATMs even more user-friendly and accessible. The continued growth of bitcoin ATMs, coupled with evolving regulatory frameworks, will pave the way for a more efficient and inclusive remittance industry.\n\nBitcoin ATMs have emerged as a disruptive force in the remittance industry, revolutionizing the way cross-border transactions are conducted. With their ability to offer reduced costs, faster transactions, enhanced transparency and increased financial inclusion, bitcoin ATMs provide a viable alternative to traditional remittance methods.\n\nThe technical foundations of bitcoin ATMs, coupled with real-world case studies and regulatory considerations, highlight the significant impact these machines are making in transforming the remittance landscape. As the technology continues to evolve and regulatory frameworks mature, the future of bitcoin ATMs in the remittance industry holds immense potential for driving financial empowerment and global connectivity.\n\nNaveed Ahmed, director of marketing at Localcoin, brings a decade-long experience in brand marketing and campaign performance, scaling over 40 DTC and B2B brands through paid media.

It would also be important to keep an eye on US$28,000 and the next major support level at US$24,000-26,500.\u201d\n\nTron\u2019s (TRX) token was the day\u2019s biggest loser, falling 2.65% in the past 24 hours to US$0.08185.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency mining rigs sit on racks at a facility in Quebec, Canada. Credit: James MacDonald/Bloomberg via Getty Images.\n\nAmerican Express, BlackRock, Citigroup, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Mastercard, Vanguard and Visa have collectively invested $1.5bn in Bitcoin mining, according to new research from Greenpeace USA. These investments contradict the companies\u2019 climate commitments, alleges the NGO.\n\nBitcoin mining consumes vast amounts of energy, equivalent to the annual energy consumption of nations like Colombia and the Czech Republic. Most of this energy derives from fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas, says Greenpeace USA.\n\nEach of the nine companies flagged by the NGO have made climate commitments or set ESG targets. Some have publicly criticised Bitcoin's environmental impact, despite continuing to invest in and expand their Bitcoin portfolios, Greenpeace USA says.\n\nIts report, Investing in Bitcoin\u2019s Climate Pollution: Big Finance is Betting on Dirty Bitcoin, ranks asset manager BlackRock and bank JP Morgan Chase as the worst offenders. Despite their sustainability commitments to reduce carbon emissions, both have invested heavily in mining companies and Bitcoin investment products.\n\n\"There is no CEO of Bitcoin. But JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock, and all of the companies we investigated have the power and resources to push for a change to the code that would eliminate nearly 100% of Bitcoin\u2019s energy use,\u201d said Joshua Archer, Greenpeace USA\u2019s Bitcoin Project Lead, in a press statement.\n\n\u201cThis is a rare opportunity to eliminate a massive amount of fossil fuel use without needing to replace it with another energy source. But instead of calling for this common sense change and leading us toward a green future, financial institutions are making a risky gamble on Bitcoin at the expense of climate and communities. By investing in mining companies, creating new avenues for Bitcoin transactions, and building new services to bring Bitcoin to a broader clientele, they are operating in contradiction with their own climate pledges. We invite them and other stakeholders to the table to plot a future for Bitcoin that\u2019s compatible with a just, habitable planet for all.\"\n\nHow well do you really know your competitors?

Visa, Mastercard, BlackRock, and CitiGroup were willing to engage in conversations about Bitcoin pollution, but to date these discussions have yielded \"limited results\". Fidelity, Vanguard, JPMorgan Chase, American Express and Goldman Sachs \"ignored or refused\" Greenpeace USA's efforts to engage them on this issue, the NGO reports.\n\nHowever, the Greenpeace report has been challenged by at least one Bitcoin ESG analyst. CH4 Capital co-founder Daniel Batten has written a rebuttal arguing that \"the report recycles many already widely-debunked claims about Bitcoin, uses unsubstantiated fear about 'what might happen'[...] and repeatedly avoids important contextualising information\".\n\nBatten says many industries apart from Bitcoin use more energy than entire countries. More than half of Bitcoin mining globally in 2023 came from sustainable energy sources. There is a growing weight of evidence \"from those most qualified to make the assessment\" to suggest that Bitcoin mining helps build out the renewable grid. In addition, it can help mitigate the venting or flaring of methane."

Blocks contain transactions and data bundled into blocks by network miners.\n\nThe metric acts as a chronological order of transactions and blocks of the network, with each new block connected to the previous one in the chain. This allows users to identify the order in which transactions are recorded.\n\nBlock height also serves as a measure of the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s immutability.

The attacker could also reverse transactions.\n\nBlock height also serves as a measure used to maintain Bitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty. Proof-of-work-based blockchain networks have their mining difficulty adjusted periodically based on the total computational power of the network and the time it took to mine a certain number of previous blocks.\n\nThe Bitcoin network generates a new block roughly every 10 minutes. If more hashing power is added to the network, it impacts this metric and automatically adjusts the mining difficulty every two weeks to maintain equilibrium.\n\nBlock height also dictates the amount of Bitcoin rewarded to miners for adding a new block to the network.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Bitcoin network passed block 800,000 on Monday, marking another major milestone in the history of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThis also means that the next Bitcoin halving event\u2014they occur every four years, reducing miners' rewards by half, and is set to occur at block 840,000\u2014is now less than nine months away (or 40,000 blocks), according to Bitcoinblockhalf.com.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate the mining of the 800,000th block, we find ourselves in a fascinating period of Bitcoin's life cycle. This is indeed a key milestone on the path to the next halving, and it certainly adds a layer of excitement to the already vibrant ecosystem,\u201d Matt Prusak, Chief Commercial Officer at Miami-based Bitcoin mining company US Bitcoin Corp told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 800,000th block was mined at a time when Bitcoin hash rate\u2014the total computational power used to mine and process transactions on the network\u2014is close to historical highs. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining difficulty\u2014another key metric measuring how challenging it is to find a new block\u2014hit a new all-time high at the most recent adjustment about two weeks ago.\n\nAccording to Prusak, these two metrics \u201crepresent an ever-evolving dance between technology and economy,\u201d and as the halving is approaching, the current trajectory suggests they will continue their upward trend.\n\n\u201cThis is mainly a reflection of the increased competition among miners, as well as advancements in mining technology that contribute to the overall efficiency and security of the network,\u201d he said.\n\nPhil Harvey, CEO of digital asset management consultant and data center operation provider Sabre56, shares similar views, saying we can witness similarities to the previous halving event in 2020\u2014\u201dwith only the fittest set to survive.\u201d\n\n\u201cPre-halving, increased hash power is supporting the network\u2019s sustained growth and robustness. This will only rise into the halving, reaching all-time highs as miners push to get miners online,\u201d Harvey told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFocus on Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe latest milestone also came amid the increased attention to Bitcoin ETFs, with many in the industry hoping that after years of rejections the U.S. Securities and Exchange will finally approve the investment tool claimed to be highly sought after by American investors.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the effect of micro and macro events, such as Bitcoin ETFs and broader regulatory developments, it is crucial to acknowledge the complex interaction between these aspects and market dynamics,\u201d said Prusak.\n\nAccording to him, the possible approval of a Bitcoin ETF could indeed be \u201ca significant catalyst for the cryptocurrency space,\u201d resulting in a more streamlined avenue for institutional and retail investors alike to gain exposure to Bitcoin, and hence potentially driving up demand and price.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is important to stress that, while these factors may have an impact, the inherent properties of Bitcoin\u2014its scarcity, decentralization, and immutability\u2014have always been its primary value propositions,\u201d added Prusak. \u201cThis is perhaps even more apparent as we move closer to the halving event, reminding us once again of the deflationary nature of this asset.\u201d\n\nWhat's in the cards for Bitcoin\n\nDespite the high expectations among investors, the price of Bitcoin plunged below $30,000 on Monday, which, according to Harvey, also bears consequences for miners\u2014the sector\u2019s key players.\n\n\u201cThe market's downturn means facility expansions are below expectations, due to capital restraints and precautionary behavior\u2014impacting deployment. Many industry players have offline equipment in warehouses, and are now scrambling to secure partners or facilities to house them,\u201d the Sabre56 CEO told Decrypt.\n\nHe also reminded that miners\u2019 profits in recent months have been supported by both price increase and a sustained transaction fee increase. However, with difficulty and hash power increasing, miners are now between a 30-50% margin at operations run at hosting costs of $0.07 - $0.05 per kWh.\n\n\u201cAs before, positive revenues from this will be curbed post-halving, until BTC increases in value, and hash power and difficulty starts to reduce,\u201d said Harvey.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUS Bitcoin Corp\u2019s Prusak also pointed out that while no one can predict with absolute certainty what\u2019s going to happen in terms of expectations for the months leading up to the halving, historically halving events have been periods of increased attention and speculation.\n\n\u201cThis, combined with the current macro events, might lead to heightened market volatility,\" Prusak said. \"As always, participants should proceed with caution, mindful of the risks associated with such periods of uncertainty.\"\n\nStill, he stressed, while the industry is \u201cindeed sailing in uncharted waters, the core tenets of Bitcoin remain robust.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt continues to be a compelling combination of technology, economics, and social dynamics. We are at the precipice of what could be another transformative period in the life of Bitcoin, one we eagerly look forward to navigating,\u201d Prusak said."

        "content": "In the latest episode of Macro Markets, Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman discusses the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s delicate balancing act of curbing inflation without causing a recession and sheds light on the potential implications for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn the crypto world, the anticipation of rising interest rates could have a short-term negative impact. This may lead to a loss of confidence in the U.S. dollar, potentially resulting in a downturn for the crypto market. Nevertheless, Pechman remains optimistic about the potential of Bitcoin (BTC), highlighting its hard-locked monetary policies as a key factor in maintaining value during times of economic uncertainty.\n\nThe much-awaited approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund takes center stage, as it could be a game-changer for the crypto market, potentially paving the way for a bullish run with a target of $200,000.\n\nShifting the focus to the bond market and insights from JPMorgan\u2019s chief investment officer for fixed income. His contrarian strategy of buying debt instruments during inflation spikes to secure higher yields proves prudent. The softening of inflation, as anticipated, validates his timing and experience in bond trading.\n\nHowever, Pechman raises an important point for crypto enthusiasts to consider: if the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates after a series of hikes in 2023, it may initially have negative implications for cryptocurrencies. As investors lose confidence in the U.S. dollar, the crypto market could experience short-term turbulence.\n\nWhile the soft landing scenario remains a critical focus for investors as the Fed\u2019s decisions unfold, crypto investors should remain vigilant and consider the long-term resilience of Bitcoin amid evolving economic dynamics.\n\nCheck out the full show on Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel, and make sure to like and subscribe for exclusive content from leading crypto analysts and experts."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nAn estimated 11% of Bitcoin\u2019s total circulating supply currently sits on exchanges.\n\nBTC held on exchanges continues to decline.\n\nTrend of Bitcoin withdrawals could have upside for BTC price.\n\nThe amount of Bitcoin being held on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges has reached lows not seen since 2018, but the metric could be a bullish sign for the future value of BTC.\n\nBitfinex released its latest Alpha report, which delves into the most prominent insights from the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. A prominent takeaway from the report focuses on dwindling levels of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply held on exchanges.\n\nAccording to the analysts, exchange balances have dropped by 32% from peaks in March 2020, down from 3.1 million BTC to 2.1 million. The report notes that just 11 percent of the circulating supply of Bitcoin remains on exchanges, which is down by 17% from March 2020.\n\nWhile the exact reasons for the trend remain a point of discussion, the report suggests that the propensity of Bitcoin users to hold their coins off exchanges could also have a positive effect on the value of the cryptocurrency in the medium term future.\n\nPlotting the Supply\n\nThe number of Bitcoin held on major exchanges has been on a continuous decline since July 21, 2021, when it reached a peak of 1,675,582 BTC. The price of Bitcoin was $34,680 on that date and started moving to the upside, ultimately reaching $65,500 on November 8 of the same\n\nWith the bear market starting after, the prices have been decreasing dramatically, but BTC accumulation continued throughout the bear market, ultimately decreasing to the levels last seen in 2018.\n\nThe first major dip was from November 21, 2022, when it was 1,35M to 1,22M on December 5 of the same year. Consequently, this is the time Bitcoin\u2019s price began to rise and made an increase from $17,088 on December 5 to $30,314 in mid-April 2023.\n\nSupply on exchanges rose in this period as well and the mid-April high could have marked the completion of a corrective structure. But supply held on exchanges started falling back down again in a sharp manner and made it back down to the pre-recovery levels on June 19.\n\nSince June 19, the number of Bitcoin held in major exchanges has been on the rise again, which correlates with the end of the price increase of Bitcoin. Can this be an early sign of the coming sellers\u2019 pressure?\n\nHow to Interpret BTC Supply On Exchanges\n\nFirst and foremost, as with every metric and technical indicator, BTC supply on exchanges should be interpreted relatively \u2013 meaning taking into account recent valuations.\n\nHowever, the consensus is that if this metric is on the rise it could mean that investors are sending BTC to exchanges from their private wallets in order to make a sale.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of Bitcoin is diminishing from exchange wallets, it usually means that investors are withdrawing the asset to their private wallets in order to hold for the long term, in other words, are accumulating.\n\nAs said above it should be viewed relatively because there can be numerous reasons why holds might want to deposit or withdraw Bitcoin from exchanges. Also, there are other players in the market that can cause the price change other than investors \u2013 miners, funds, and even exchanges.\n\nOther Evidence of Accumulation?\n\nAside from the discussed metric other on-chain charts can be cross-referenced to support the accumulation assumptions.\n\nOne of them is Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), which indicates whether or not long-term holders are moving their coins for a possible sell. If the values are high, then an incoming selling pressure is possible, but if the value is low, then it could indicate that long-term holders are still accumulating, or at least sitting tight.\n\nThe chart above shows that the values are small, meaning that long-term holders are still sitting on the sidelines.\n\nAnother way of looking at the possibility of long-term investors accumulating is by looking into whale activity.\n\nThe exchange whale ratio has been on the rise since June 25, meaning that they are using the exchanges more than usual. It\u2019s important to note that true whales don\u2019t use exchanges but more often OTC services to mitigate the risk of slippage and impact the price when accumulating.\n\nBe it as it may, this metric shows us that even so, the interest is high at the moment, and large transactions have been seen as this metric is calculated as the relative size of the top 10 inflow transactions to total inflows.\n\nAccumulate Rather than Trade\n\nThe analysts concede that the decline of BTC on exchanges could be attributed to the usage of alternatives like decentralized exchanges and funds not covered by its data, but note that available metrics indicate widespread moves to withdraw Bitcoin from exchanges.\n\n\u201cThis is also a testament of how longer-term holders are moving coins to cold storage. We see this as a positive for the price as more investors indicate the desire to accumulate rather than trade.\u201d\n\nThe report also notes that derivatives market participation is increasing, which historically precedes price increases as spot prices decrease.\n\nCryptocurrency-backed investment funds saw a net inflow of $137 million in the third week of July, with 99% of these funds moving to Bitcoin-backed funds. This could also be driven by the fanfare surrounding renewed applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds headlined by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nThe analysts added that crypto funds have seen four consecutive weeks of gross inflows, with $742 million of investments over the last month.\n\nShorters Underscore Bitcoin\u2019s Dominance\n\nThe report also indicates that Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has been driven by outflows from Bitcoin shorting funds, which rise in value as the market price of BTC drops.\n\n\u201cThese funds experienced $3.2 million in outflows for the week, reinforcing the bullish sentiment for the BTC price among investors, which has now been in a tight range for months,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe report said that the data could be used as a \u201cproxy for institutional investor bias\u201d that will see the price of BTC break out of its current range to the upside. Analysts added that these factors paint a picture of Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in the market, despite alt coins growing in market capitalization:\n\n\u201cThe sustained inflows into Bitcoin-backed funds indicate a strong investor confidence in the asset, despite the volatility inherent in the crypto market.\u201d\n\nAddressing the Whale in the Room\n\nThe activity of Bitcoin whales, users that hold major sums of the cryptocurrency, also revealed some interesting on-chain events in recent weeks.\n\nBlockchain data showing a period of increased inflows of BTC onto exchanges was linked to the distribution of 9,852 BTC seized from Silk Road by the United States Justice Department.\n\n\n\nThe institution moved a total of 9,825 BTC to exchanges on July 12, as it began its distribution strategy involving multiple wallets offloading BTC to different exchanges.\n\nChart analysis provided by Nikola Lazic"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) enters the last full week of July on an uncertain footing as $30,000 becomes resistance.\n\nIn what promises to be an exciting, if potentially nerve-racking, week for traders, BTC price action is staring down a combination of volatility triggers.\n\nChief among these is the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on interest rates, this headlining an important slew of macro data releases.\n\nSome hope these alone will be enough to shake Bitcoin out of its month-long trading range, which has barely moved from the $30,000 mark. The market has so far offered little cues as to where it might head next.\n\nThat said, traders have become impatient and increasingly believe that BTC/USD will ultimately break down from current levels to head toward $25,000 or lower.\n\nCointelegraph takes a look at the main factors in the debate over BTC price performance as July comes to a close.\n\nBTC price tags $29,000 in bearish start to week\n\nBitcoin delivered a classic volatility burst into the July 23 weekly close, giving bulls a glimpse of $30,000 support potentially returning.\n\nHowever, this was short-lived, and with hours left to go until the weekly candle close, BTC/USD retraced its last-minute gains to end the week at almost exactly $30,000.\n\nOvernight price action was still weaker; at the time of writing, Bitcoin was headed toward $29,000, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.\n\nOverall, however, the all-too-familiar range continues to endure.\n\nAs the weekend came to a close, Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight, highlighted what he called the \u201ccrucial area\u201d for bulls to break through.\n\n\u201cThe crucial level didn\u2019t break for Bitcoin, so we\u2019ll continue the sideways chop,\u201d he continued on the day.\n\n\u201cThe scenarios remain the same; - Longs above $30,200-30,400 - Longs when we get to $29,000.\u201c\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe/Twitter\n\nPopular trader Daan Crypto Trades noted that the spike to $30,300 had effectively opened up and already closed a CME futures gap.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fall for the weekend deviations,\u201d he told Twitter followers.\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Daan Crypto Trades/Twitter\n\nA cautiously optimistic take on the past month\u2019s range came from fellow trader Credible Crypto, who suggested that Bitcoin could avoid more significant losses.\n\n\u201cFor the last 30 days price has been within a tight range and aggregate OI has oscillated between 2 key levels,\u201d he summarized.\n\n\u201cPrice ranges, OI builds, then we see a flush up/down which resets OI before the cycle repeats. If it continues, downside should be limited here at the lows.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nFed rate hike decision leads \u201caction packed week\u201d\n\nOne event dominates the macro landscape this week \u2014 not only in crypto.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will meet on July 26 to decide how far to raise benchmark interest rates \u2014 if at all.\n\nUnlike last month, markets have little doubt that a hike is to come with language from Fed officials leading them to practically unanimously predict a 0.25% increase.\n\nAccording to the latest data from CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, the odds currently stand at 99.8%.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart. Source: CME Group\n\nThe week\u2019s macro data releases will only come after FOMC, leaving no room for these to sway a decision in time. The releases are no less important, however, and include Q2 GDP and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index print.\n\n\u201cNothing like an action packed week in the markets. 20% of S&P 500 companies reporting earnings along with a Fed meeting and inflation data to top it off,\u201d financial commentary resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of a Twitter summary.\n\n\u201cAfter a couple weeks of low volatility, things should get interesting this week. It\u2019s a great week to be a trader.\u201d\n\nKey Events This Week:\n\n\n\n1. Consumer Confidence data - Tuesday\n\n\n\n2. New Home Sales data - Wednesday\n\n\n\n3. Fed Interest Rate Decision - Wednesday\n\n\n\n4. Q2 2023 GDP data - Thursday\n\n\n\n5.

Analyzing the hash ribbons metric, Charles Edwards, founder of crypto asset manager Capriole Investments, flagged a new \u201ccapitulation\u201d phase.\n\nWhile absent from the market since late 2022, when Bitcoin still suffered the consequences of the FTX meltdown, a capitulation is nothing for traders to fear, Edwards argued.\n\nDespite this, he called the explosive growth in the hash rate of the past seven months \u201cunsustainable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a Hash Ribbon capitulation. AKA a slowing in Bitcoin\u2019s Hash Rate growth after what has been an incredible (unsustainable) 50% increase in 2023,\u201d he commented last week.\n\n\u201cHR capitulation is not a sell signal, but it\u2019s also not bullish. Risk management warranted until growth resumes.\u201d\n\nBitcoin hash ribbons chart. Source: Charles Edwards/Twitter\n\nCointelegraph continues to cover the status quo among miners, with various theories emerging over recent BTC selling behavior.\n\nNVT taps highest since 2019\n\nAs Bitcoin mines its 800,000th block, a classic on-chain metric is delivering a similar signal that \u2014 at least for the time being \u2014 BTC price conditions may be overheated.\n\nThe network value to transaction (NVT) ratio, which divides the Bitcoin market cap by the U.S. dollar value of daily on-chain transactions, has hit four-year highs.\n\nNVT seeks to give an indication of when the on-chain volume is out of sync with overall network value, but its implications can vary.\n\nAs explained by its creator, analyst Willy Woo, NVT spikes can occur in both bull markets and periods of \u201cunsustainable\u201d price growth.\n\n\u201cWhen Bitcoin`s NVT is high, it indicates that its network valuation is outstripping the value being transmitted on its payment network, this can happen when the network is in high growth and investors are valuing it as a high return investment, or alternatively when the price is in an unsustainable bubble,\u201d he wrote in an accompanying introduction to the metric on his analytics site, Woobull.\n\nBitcoin NVT ratio chart (screenshot). Source: Woobull\n\nIn his latest interview with Cointelegraph, Capriole\u2019s Edwards argued that NVT was still in check versus extreme highs, such as those seen during 2021.\n\n\u201cNVT is currently trading at a normal level,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cgiven its normalized reading today, it doesn\u2019t tell us much; just that Bitcoin is fairly valued according to this metric alone.\u201d\n\nLong-term holders control 75% of BTC supply\n\nA silver lining in the making? Bitcoin\u2019s available supply continues to shrink behind the scenes.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin can still hit $19K, warns trader ahead of BTC price \u2018big move\u2019\n\nAs noted by various market participants, the amount of BTC on offer for purchase shows enduring conviction among its most ardent hodlers.\n\n55% of the supply has now remained dormant for at least two years, and 29% for five years or more, data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode states.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply has reached a new ATH of 14.52M BTC, equivalent to 75% of the circulating supply,\u201d additional analysis highlighted this week.\n\n\u201cThis suggests HODLing is the preferred market dynamic amongst mature investors.\u201d\n\nAn accompanying chart showed the amount of BTC in the hands of so-called long-term holders, or LTHs, defined as entities hodling coins for 155 days or more.\n\nBitcoin long-term hodler supply annotated chart.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe week ending July 21 saw a withdrawal of $13 million from Bitcoin investment products.\n\nDuring the same week, short Bitcoin products had outflows of $5.5 million.\n\nInvestment instruments for Ether and XRP are booming as Bitcoin products experience a decline\n\nThere has been a discernible change in the crypto market where investors are becoming less interested in once-popular Bitcoin-related financial products and more fond of altcoins. The fact that there have been outflows for the first time since Blackrock applied to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF in June indicates that investor opinion has changed.\n\nJames Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares, reported on July 24 that the $13 million in withdrawals from Bitcoin investment products for the week ending July 21 had reversed five weeks of inflows.\n\nDuring the week, there were outflows of $5.5 million from short Bitcoin products.\n\nBitcoin Fear and Greed Index is 50 ~ Neutral\n\nCurrent price: $29,178 pic.twitter.com/T1DMFpsX9p \u2014 Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (@BitcoinFear) July 25, 2023\n\nIn comparison, investment instruments for Ether and XRP are booming as Bitcoin products experience this decline. These alternative cryptocurrencies, which have seen a combined inflow of $9.2 million over the last week, are establishing themselves as market leaders.\n\nLast week, Ether investing tools won the competition for best performers, bringing in $6.6 million. Following closely behind was an infusion of $2.6 million into XRP funds. Other alternative currencies, such Solana and Polygon, have also seen sizeable inflows of $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\n\nInvestor preferences have changed as a result of Ripple\u2019s partial victory over the US Securities and Exchange Commission on July 13. The court\u2019s crucial decision that XRP is not a security when sold to the general public on exchanges may increase investor trust.\n\nBTC\u2019s price is at $29,128, down 3.1% from the previous day.\n\nLosing Interest in ETFs For Altcoins?\n\nSince mid-June, a number of financial organizations have submitted Exchange Traded Fund applications for Bitcoin.\n\nSince the first U.S. Bitcoin exchange-traded fund application was made in 2013, Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have become a significant issue for the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAs its underlying asset, a Bitcoin ETF monitors the value of Bitcoin. According to supporters of a Bitcoin ETF, a significant barrier to entry for newcomers to the cryptocurrency field is the intricacy of exchanges, digital wallets, and private keys. Without actually holding any Bitcoin themselves, these investors can gain exposure to the cryptocurrency through a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBitcoin ETFs have appeared worldwide, particularly in Canada, Brazil, and Dubai, where they are regarded as significant deal. Additionally, the NYSE introduced the ProShares Bitcoin futures ETF.\n\nBitcoin: Still the Principal Player\n\nDespite this brief downturn, Bitcoin maintains its hegemony in the market for digital assets. It\u2019s $558 million in inflows in 2023 helped it reach a significant $25.0 billion in assets under management. As a result, it continues to own 67.4% of the market.\n\nSeveral financial institutions have been waiting in line to submit Exchange Traded Fund applications for Bitcoin spot with the SEC during the past month. Since mid-June, the following companies have entered the race: BlackRock, ARK Invest, Fidelity, Galaxy Digital, VanEck, Valkyrie Investments, NYDIG, SkyBridge, and WisdomTree. This shows that investors continue to believe in Bitcoin\u2019s potential.\n\nThe Bitcoin market\u2019s evolving terrain makes for an interesting sight. Altcoins are becoming increasingly popular among investors as Bitcoin investment products experience outflows. Despite suggesting a possibly more varied future, this pattern does not seriously challenge Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance.\n\nWhat Are Other Desirable Coins?\n\nInstead speaking about Bitcoin only, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst has forecasted brief price increases for a few altcoins, including those that compete with Ethereum (ETH), such as Polkadot (DOT), Cardano (ADA), and Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nCrypto trader Benjamin Cowen explains to his 784,000 YouTube subscribers in a new strategy session that cryptocurrencies in 2023 are likely to follow the same trend they did in 2018, when they dramatically increased before falling down to new lows.\n\nCowen predicts that the current cryptocurrency rise will be similar to those in the past and will probably come to an end once Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) dominance level returns to its previous level.\n\nThe Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) chart, which shows how much of the overall cryptocurrency market cap is owned by Bitcoin, is closely watched by traders. A greater BTC dominance level suggests that traders prefer the most popular digital asset over alternative currencies.\n\nAccording to Cowen, several cryptocurrencies, including Polkadot, Cardano, Avalanche, and Polygon, are currently honoring their 20-week simple moving average (SMA) as resistance."

        "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: History and Celebration - crypto.news",
        "content": "Bitcoin pizza has become a popular trend in recent years, with restaurants now accepting digital currency payments for delicious slices. These businesses recognize the potential benefits of using Bitcoin, such as the ability to accept payments from customers who prefer not to store their credit card information on their phones. With pizza and Bitcoin being a perfect combination, this article will explore the origin and significance of Bitcoin Pizza Day.\n\nBTC Pizza Day Origin\n\nLaszlo Hanyecz, a pioneer cryptocurrency user, paid 10,000 bitcoins ($267 million, as of today) for two pizzas on May 22, 2010. This transaction marked the first use of bitcoin in purchasing goods.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is observed globally on May 22. The day commemorates the first use of decentralized digital money to purchase a pizza in the real world.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/coingecko/status/1660460347265019905\n\nSignificance of Bitcoin Pizza Day\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is celebrated essentially as a technological revolution and invention of alternative money. High inflation rates experienced in 2010, just after the global financial crisis, raised questions about the economic models and policies and the role of traditional fiat currency as a store of value. Bitcoin was a relief.\n\nBitcoin gained some real-world tangibility and gave crypto enthusiasts a realization of how it could represent the negotiated value traders in virtual deals.\n\nThe Bitcoin community has since expanded, with numerous new developments increasing Bitcoin use cases and transaction costs slashed. Many traders currently accept Bitcoin payments for goods and services.\n\nThe May 22 pizza transaction gave way for a tamper-proof, sensor-proof digital currency with no centralized issuer.\n\nHistory of Bitcoin Pizza Day\n\nOn May 18, 2010, a Florida programmer and early bitcoin miner named Laszlo Hanyecz said on Bitcointalk.org that he wished to buy pizza using bitcoin. He offered 10,000 BTC to anyone willing to take him up on his offer, to order, collect and deliver them to him. 19-year-old bitcoin user Jeremy Sturdivant took him up on his trade and offered $41 for those bitcoins, pricing BTC at less than half a cent per coin. He took up the offer, purchased the Pizzas from Papa Jones at $25, and delivered them. This transaction marked a historical event.\n\nBy May 2010, bitcoin boasted a small but growing economy, mostly trading peer-to-peer and on small exchanges. The use of bitcoin to purchase goods was unheard of.\n\nHanyecz acquired his bitcoins through mining on his laptop. Bitcoin mining on consumer-grade hardware was utterly sensible at the time. Bitcoin mining is a highly competitive industry, with extensive mining firms spending millions of dollars developing specialized hardware such as ASICs.\n\nBefore the first bitcoin halving in 2012, successful miners earned 50 BTC, meaning miners needed only 200 blocks to earn 10,000 BTC, a task not so tricky given there weren\u2019t many people competing to mine.\n\nThe following are key highlights of the history of Bitcoin Pizza Day:\n\n10,000 BTC was worth $41\n\nHanyecz traded his bitcoin for $41, putting the price per bitcoin at roughly $0.004.\n\nHanyecz waited four days to get a delivery\n\nHanyecz initially posted on the Bitcoin.org forums on Tuesday, May 18, but he got his order a while. Jercos completed the delivery the next day, the transaction at around 2:16 p.m. EST.\n\nHanyecz bought more than two Pizzas for bitcoin\n\nEnticed by the response and possibility of buying pizza using bitcoin, Hanyecz pushed the limit in June, announcing that the deal was \u2018an open offer,\u2019 but brought it to a close in August since he could not generate thousands of coins daily.\n\nJercos sold his bitcoin\n\nFive years after the trade, Sturdivant disposed of his bitcoin worth about $400. He supported the currency spending, noting that the 10,000 BTC he received quickly returned to the economy.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day wasn\u2019t as popular\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is currently widely known. However, it was non-existent before 2014 since awareness of Bitcoin was relatively low.\n\nHanyecz\u2019s story, partly popularised by a New York Times article, was boosted in 2014 by a blog and tweet from the @Bitcoin Twitter handle.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day isn\u2019t the first \u201cbitcoin holiday\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the Bitcoin community was keen to mark the disappearance of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto after stepping down from his role as project lead. April 28, 2011, was dubbed \u201cSatoshi Disappear Day.\u201d\n\nPictures of the Real Bitcoin Pizzas\n\nHanyecz\u2019s penchant for photography led him to maintain well-kept records of what the pies looked like in 2010.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is a global phenomenon. Bitcoin is now widely known worldwide, and its value is no longer that of a few cents on the dollar. Companies and businesses appreciate the value of crypto and offer services payable using crypto. This economic revolution continues to gain momentum as adoption and uses cases increase."

For now, the reward locations appear to be concentrated around major cities across the United States and Europe.

        "title": "Auradine Unveils World's First 4nm Bitcoin Mining Systems - GlobeNewswire",
        "content": "Auradine\u2019s Teraflux\u2122 systems deliver best-in-class performance, efficiency, and total cost of ownership (TCO)\n\nEnergyTune\u2122 enables rapid demand response and optimal energy usage for electrical grids\n\nTeraflux\u2122 product line is designed & manufactured in the US and provides increased supply chain resiliency\n\n\n\nSILICON VALLEY, Calif., July 25, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Auradine , a leader in web infrastructure solutions including blockchain, AI, and privacy today announced the launch of its Teraflux\u2122 product range of bitcoin miners. The game-changing Teraflux\u2122 family is powered by the world\u2019s first 4nm silicon chip technology for bitcoin mining designed by the Auradine team in the US. Auradine\u2019s comprehensive range of Teraflux systems includes air-cooled, single-phase, and dual-phase immersion cooling miners. The systems will ship to early access customers in Q3 with production volumes starting in Q4 2023.\n\nBitcoin has proven to be the most secure and decentralized digital asset over the last decade with the highest adoption. Today, over 35% of global bitcoin mining happens in the United States , but a significant majority of system solutions are designed and/or manufactured in Asia leading to supply chain risks from geo-political and other factors. Additionally, mining operators are locating themselves close to energy sources in harsh environments, to utilize wasted or excess energy in variable demand-supply situations.\n\nThe Auradine team leveraged their proven expertise in semiconductor design, software engineering, and high-performance, telco-grade systems to develop the Teraflux\u2122 family. Teraflux\u2122 systems enable a secure global \u2018 Bitcoin 3.0 \u2019 blockchain that can provide stability to the mismatched demand and supply needs of the energy ecosystem, drive the growth of renewable infrastructure, and enable grid modernization.\n\nThe Teraflux\u2122 bitcoin miner family delivers several compelling benefits to the Bitcoin industry, including:\n\nUnrivaled speed and efficiency: world\u2019s fastest air-cooled system performance with hash rates up to 185 TH/s and up to 3x higher hashing density (TH/s per unit volume) immersion miners, delivering significant capex benefits.\n\nEnergyTune\u2122 innovation: patent pending technology that allows miners to dynamically adjust the energy consumption and bitcoin hash rate based on demand response needs of the electrical grids.\n\nSuperior uptime and TCO: designed to operate under harsh conditions at data center scale including ability to operate air-cooled miners up to 50\u00b0C ambient, boot-up in sub-zero temperatures, and maintain operations without reboots.\n\n\n\nFred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings, mentioned \u201cthe Teraflux\u2122 range enables us to rapidly drive improved demand response at a fleet level that is critical to our mining operations. Auradine\u2019s team experience in developing high performance systems with a focus on reliability and uptime along with the ability to source a US based supply was important in our decision to move forward with the Teraflux\u2122 products.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be launching Teraflux\u2122 as our first product line supporting Bitcoin being a responsible partner to the energy ecosystem, along with strong customer traction. Our focus continues to be on innovation, scalability, and sustainability. We are continuing work to drive the next generation of internet infrastructure across blockchain, AI, and privacy,\u201d said Rajiv Khemani, Co-Founder and CEO of Auradine.\n\nAuradine has developed a comprehensive partnership ecosystem for the Teraflux\u2122 range including open API\u2019s to enable simple and rapid deployability. This includes:\n\nFluxVision\u2122 as a comprehensive cloud-based solution with UI\u2019s for managing the miners at data center scale including UI\u2019s for EnergyTune and AutoTune.\n\nOpen API\u2019s for connecting into in-house or third-party miner management systems.\n\nIntegration with major fleet management software solutions from Foreman and Awesome Miner, a product from IntelliBreeze Software AB.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has been a pleasure to have been working closely with Auradine\u2019s engineering team on a smooth integration using FluxVision API\u2019s to ensure a powerful offering for mining customers,\u201d Patrik Engstr\u00f6m, CEO of IntelliBreeze Software AB, indicated.\n\nIn May of this year, Auradine secured $81 million in Series A funding led by Celesta Capital and Mayfield. The funding has fueled Auradine's mission to power the future of web infrastructure and unlock the full potential of digitized assets.\n\nFor more information or to place an order for the Teraflux\u2122 range, please visit www.auradine.com or contact sales@auradine.com .\n\nAbout Auradine\n\nAuradine is a leader in web infrastructure solutions focused on blockchain, AI, and privacy.

Discover SCENE\n\nEven long-dormant Bitcoin whales can\u2019t sit still.\n\nA number of big investors holding millions of dollars in BTC moved their holdings last week after years of dormancy.\n\nOn July 20, two wallets from 2011, each holding 10 BTC (valued at $292,767 as of this writing), moved their holdings to new locations. The next day, a wallet holding 5 BTC ($146,383) budged after 12 years of inactivity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen, around $30.3 million in \u201cdigital gold\u201d\u2014or 1,037 BTC\u2014moved after its owner put it in a new wallet for the first time since 2012. The price of the cryptocurrency was $4.92 per coin back then.\n\nA BTC whale that has been dormant for 11 years transferred all 1,037.42 $BTC($37.8M) to a new address\"bc1qtl\" an hour ago. The whale received 1,037.42 $BTC($5,107 at that time) on Apr 11, 2012, when the price was $4.92.https://t.co/k8ZmO5vc8X pic.twitter.com/xBaw2dQfY8 \u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 22, 2023\n\nFinally, on July 24, a wallet from 2010 moved a hefty 50 BTC, or $1.4 million.\n\nBitcoin whales are investors who hoard huge amounts of Bitcoin (at least 1,000 BTC) and don\u2019t touch it for years, sitting on astronomical gains as a result.\n\nSuch investors have proven to be more successful than traders that buy and sell Bitcoin over a short period: the asset is extremely volatile in the short-term but over the past 10 years it has shot up from under $95 per coin to $29,203\u2014a 30,700% increase.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhales have certainly been on the move this year. Blockchain data firm Glassnode said in a Monday report that there has been a \u201cdramatic uptick over recent months,\u201d and noted that a number of whales have been moving holdings to exchanges\u2014usually the best way to cash out, or shift holdings to other digital assets.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear whether these whales are individuals or companies, but Dr. Kirill Kretov, a developer of tools for automated trading and blockchain analyst, previously told Decrypt that it was possible that these transactions represent commercial entities buying the Bitcoin from individuals."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens continued their downward movement on Tuesday, as the digital token trader shifted their focus to Sam Altman affiliated Worldcoin, which is now banned in the US. However, traders will be looking at the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting.\n\n\n\nBitcoin continued to bleed on Tuesday as the largest crypto token dropped more than 2 per cent to barely hold 29,000-mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum, was trading lower, falling about a per cent but managed to hold $1,850-level. Price in the action altcoins was on the downside during the early day.\n\n\n\nThe overall crypto market has observed some selling pressure in the last 24 hours. The crypto fear and greed index has swung back into the neutral zone after observing a drop of 5 points; the current score is at 50/100, said Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk.\n\n\n\n\"Dogecoin has shown a positive price action within a few minutes after Twitter CEO Elon Musk changed the Twitter logo to X.com - with his location teasing the DOGE logo, making traders speculate the use of DOGE on the new X app,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring the Dogecoin and the US dollar pegged stablecoins, all other top crypto tokens were trading lower on Tuesday. XRP and Bitcoin Cash dropped 5 per cent each, while Solana tanked 4 per cent. Litecoin, Cardano and Toncoin shed 3 per cent each. Among the gainers, Dogecoin surged 8 per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly lower, falling down to $1.17 trillion-mark as it declined two per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes zoomed about 42 per cent to $34.47 billion.\n\nBitcoin volatility has dipped to its lowest level in a year as investors await the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting this week. The FOMC is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points this week with an expectation that this may be the last rate hike by the Federal Reserve in the foreseeable future, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by WazirX Trade Desk\n\nTomoChain (TOMO) is a project aimed at enhancing the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain, primarily by boosting its transactions per second (TPS) capacity. The ultimate objective of the project is to construct a blockchain infrastructure catering to decentralized apps (DApps) while enhancing integration and security.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TOMO/USDT price has jumped up by nearly 4 per cent in the last 24 hours. In the weekly time frame, TOMO has formed a distinctive cup and handle pattern, with the trend almost breaking out of the same. The next resistance is expected at $1.66 and a strong support is expected at the $0.81 level.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Bitcoin traded flat on Wednesday morning in Asia as risk-aversion remained the market theme, though the token managed to hold above US$29,000. Analysts say a possible extended legal fight between the U.S. regulator and Ripple Labs as well as comments from the Federal Reserve on the interest rate outlook expected later today is breeding caution. Ether also treaded water, while other leading tokens were a mixed picture. Dogecoin led the winners again on speculation it may be integrated into Twitter as the social media app gets revamped into a more general-purpose platform. Elsewhere, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped and U.S. equity futures traded mixed after Wall Street closed higher on Tuesday.\n\nBitcoin lacking catalysts\n\nBitcoin inched 0.14% higher over the last 24 hours to US$29,222 as of 07:35 a.m. in Hong Kong, but lost 2.07% for the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. After briefly falling to a monthly low of US$28,890 on Monday, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has seemingly found support around US$29,000.\n\n\u201cSeveral factors are currently affecting Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, including concerns about the Ripple case resumption and investors\u2019 speculation on Bitcoin investment funds,\u201d Rania Gule, an analyst at Cyprus-headquartered multi-asset broker XS Group, said in an emailed comment.\n\nThe market is keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision, while negative headlines about Binance, the world\u2019s largest digital currency exchange, contributed to price declines across crypto, Gule added.\n\n\u201cThe main trendline support currently stands at $26,800, and as long as Bitcoin remains above it, the trend is expected to be bullish,\u201d said Gule.\n\nWilliam Cai, co-founder and managing partner at New York-based asset manager Wilshire Phoenix, said Bitcoin has been trading within a tight US$25,000 to US$30,000 range and is in search of a story and \u201ca major Fed rate or language surprise this week could provide the impetus needed to break out.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nReflecting the current lacklustre trend, CoinMarketCap\u2019s fear and greed index, a measure of market buy and sell sentiment, fell further into neutral territory on Wednesday with a reading of 52.\n\nThe caution was reflected in digital asset investment products that saw net outflows of US$6.5 million in the week ending July 21, following four prior weeks of consecutive inflows that totaled US$742 million, according to a Monday report from European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares.\n\nTrading volumes in such investment products last week fell to US$1.2 billion, below the yearly average and down from US$2.4 billion the prior week, according to CoinShares. By regions, the U.S. and Canada saw 97% of the total outflows of US$21.7 million.\n\nBitcoin-backed investment products were the primary focus which saw US$13 million of outflows last week, while Ether-backed products logged an inflow of US$6.6 million, suggesting sentiment is improving around the second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nEther edged up 0.41% to US$1,857 in early trading in Asia on Wednesday, but remained 2.17% lower for the week.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Dogecoin, XRP, and Tron\u2019s TRX logging gains, while the rest declined. Polygon\u2019s Matic led the losers, falling 2.84% to US$0.7081 and down 4.12% for the week.\n\nDogecoin again headed the winners list on optimism it could become a feature in Twitter\u2019s rebranding to X.com, which will include functions such as \u201cpayments/banking,\u201d according to Twitter Chief Executive Officer Linda Yaccarino on Monday.\n\n\u201cDogecoin rallied recently as speculation increased that the meme coin could be used as a payment mechanism for the rebranded Twitter platform,\u201d said Markus Thielen, head of crypto research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cAs crypto is entering the summer lull that we initially expected for August, DOGE might be the summer\u2019s highflyer as other crypto themes are taking a backseat.\u201d\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.22% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume fell 27.41% to US$25.68 billion.\n\nForkast 500 dips, Axie Infinity developer to make NFT game with CyberKongz\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.60% in the past 24 hours to 2,642.91 as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 2.60% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon NFT market indexes also logged losses, while the Cardano index edged higher.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dipped 2.90% in the past 24 hours to US$17.77 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Polygon Solana and Bitcoin networks rose, while Ethereum, BNB Chain and Cardano logged losses\n\nBy NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) topped the 24-hour trading volumes, though total trades fell 39.79% to around US$695,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another slow day in the NFT market, with a majority of NFT trades still being wash trades, or sellers accepting points farmers offer on Blur,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nThe floor prices of leading Ethereum NFT collections Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) have dropped 18% and 25% in the past 30 days, while trading volumes in the two collections over the same period slumped 80% and 67% respectively, according to NFT data tracker WGMI.io.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing happening out there to make buyers want to buy NFTs at the prices they\u2019re at still. Really, they\u2019re massively overpriced even after declining over the year,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nYuga Labs, the developer of BAYC and MAYC, launched \u201cMade by Apes\u201d on Tuesday \u2013 a platform that grants BAYC and MAYC holders unique on-chain licences for their own products or services featuring the ape-themed NFTs.\n\nBAYC holders have already been building businesses around their collections, including fast food, clothing, and beverage operations, and more brands are using BAYC in promotions.\n\n\u201cDuring this bear market we are seeing actual utility begin to get fleshed out like with Yuga Labs\u2019 new fully on-chain IP licensing platform,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nElsewhere, Sky Mavis, the Vietnam-based developer behind play-to-earn NFT game Axie Infinity, announced a partnership with NFT project CyberKongz on Tuesday, where the two will jointly develop an NFT game based on CyberKongz\u2019s incoming Genkai NFT collection.\n\nU.S. equity futures stall ahead of Fed move\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell|Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday in Hong Kong, with Dow Jones and Nasdaq futures inching lower, while S&P 500 futures edged up.\n\nAll three major U.S. indexes closed higher in regular Tuesday trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average logging gains for the 12th consecutive day, extending its longest winning streak in six years.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes fell on Wednesday ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate announcement later today. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged losses.\n\nAlthough a China Politburo meeting on Monday pledged policies to support the country\u2019s ailing property market and revive domestic consumption, China\u2019s stock market requires imminent and actionable measures from the government, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday citing a note by U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe U.S. Fed announces its interest rate decision on Wednesday with analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predicting a 98.9% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike this month.\n\nWith a rise in rates mostly priced into markets, the focus of attention will be comments by Fed chair Jerome Powell on how the central bank views inflation trends, offering some pointers on future monetary policies.\n\nThe current Fed under Powell has raised rates 10 times since March 2022 to tackle inflation that was running at 40-year highs last year. The annual inflation rate has since fallen to 3% in June from more than 9% last year.\n\nHowever, with inflation still above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%, economists forecast more potential hikes this year based on recent comments by Powell.\n\nOn the economic data front, the U.S. consumer confidence index hit a two-year high in July, according to the U.S. think tank Conference Board on Tuesday, \u201clikely reflecting lower inflation and a tight labor market.\u201d\n\nThe consumer confidence index, together with data on inflation, the housing market and retail sales, contributed to the optimism that the U.S. economy could avoid a recession in 2023, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section, adds fear and greed index in first section.)"

        "title": "From rugs to riches: UK carpet retailer to adopt Bitcoin standard - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "An online carpet and flooring retailer based in the United Kingdom has bought Bitcoin (BTC) and put it on its balance sheet, following in the footsteps of Tesla, MicroStrategy and Real Bedford.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Paul Brewster, the CEO of Flooring Hut, explained:\n\n\u201cWe see it [Bitcoin] as an asset that has probably the best potential for growth of our capital reserves at the moment.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the company decided against keeping its cash reserves in a bank account, as Bitcoin could provide the greatest potential for providing returns, ultimately delivering better value for customers.\n\nAccording to Companies House, the government agency that maintains the register of U.K. companies, Flooring Hut\u2019s accounts from 2023 showed cash reserves of \u00a375,105, which at the time of writing could buy roughly 3.3 BTC.\n\nFlooring Hut\u2019s cash assets. Source: gov.uk\n\nMoreover, the company is Bitcoin-only. Brewster explained that \u201cBitcoin is an asset class in its own right,\u201d saying it is akin to \u201cdigital gold.\u201d While on a personal level, Brewster and his colleagues have an interest in the wider cryptocurrency space, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be putting those on the balance sheet at Flooring Hut any time soon,\u201d he said.\n\nFlooring Hut will not custody the coins with crypto companies such as Coinbase or the now-defunct FTX. Instead, the company will resist rug pulls and keep the Bitcoin in cold storage, Brewster added.\n\nThis bold decision by the online retailer operating in the 2 billion pound carpet industry is particularly surprising, as it\u2019s one of the \u201cvery few sectors where the application of technology has been severely lacking,\u201d Brewster explained. The Financial Times, one of the U.K.\u2019s most popular legacy finance publications, was quick to swipe at Flooring Hut on its page Alphaville.\n\nThe Financial Times pokes fun at the move. Source: FT\n\nIn the article, the FT explained that the Flooring Hut news \u201cis obviously engineering the kind of publicity stunt that\u2019s catnip for snarky blogs such as ours.\u201d The article\u2019s comments section is even more scathing, with one commenter exclaiming, \u201cThis is pure comedy!\u201d\n\nBrewster understands Bitcoin\u2019s somewhat negative portrayal in the mainstream media:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to be mindful that people draw connotations from what they read in the media. When they see the word Bitcoin, they think, \u2018Oh, is this company legit?\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, businesses across the U.K. seek innovative ways to invest their capital, as cash sitting in the bank depreciates under high inflation. The U.K. and its currency, the pound, are suffering more acutely than the European Union. As Brewster explains, managing a business in 2023 in such trying economic conditions is about being \u201cprogressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to reinvest that back into the company, which then leads to greater value for money for our customers, which gives us a competitive advantage over our competitors.\u201d\n\nThe company is heading down the path of a Bitcoin standard \u2014 building out a business with Bitcoin in mind. Next, it will explore the implementation of Bitcoin Lightning Network payments to complement its online Mastercard, Visa and PayPal payment options.\n\nPaying in Bitcoin is a small but growing trend in the U.K., particularly as the Lightning Network offers lower fees than existing payment providers.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin block 800,000 mined \u2014 What\u2019s next?\n\nThe price per Bitcoin is up more than 60% in 2023 in British pounds, starting on Jan.1 at \u00a313,700. Nonetheless, Bitcoin continues to be volatile. The price corrected 2% today, while some traders predict a price plummet to $19,000 in the near term.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Peter McCormack\u2019s Real Bedford Football Club puts Bitcoin on the map"

        "content": "ALBANY, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Soluna Holdings, Inc. (\u201cSHI\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), (NASDAQ: SLNH), the parent company of Soluna Computing, Inc. (\u201cSCI\u201d), a developer of green data centers for Bitcoin mining and other intensive computing applications, announced today it has made significant progress on its commercialization plan for Project Dorothy and Project Sophie, deploying more than 30 MW of equipment at Project Dorothy and bringing Project Sophie fully operational. Based on this progress, the Company is on track to achieve a significant company milestone of 2 EH/s under management. These operational milestones and improvements have resulted in a stronger cash position for the Company year over year.\n\nJohn Belizaire, CEO of Soluna Holdings, commented, \u201cWe continue to execute on the plan laid out in my letter to shareholders. In June we gave an operational update that focused on achieving cash flow positive from operations during the second half of 2023. As one can see by these updates, we continue to get more miners online, and are now on track to exceed 2 EH/s under management.\u201d\n\nProject Sophie (Hosting):\n\nOn April 6, 2023 Soluna announced a 25 MW hosting contract with a sustainability focused hosting customer.\n\nSince then, Soluna has deployed miners to the entire site and has been running at full capacity.\n\nIn June, the site achieved one of the highest utilization in its operating history.\n\nThe site holds great revenue potential, estimated at $3.21 million on an annualized basis. (As of Earnings Power Illustration June 21, 2023.)1\n\nProject Dorothy 1A (Hosting):\n\nOn May 10, 2023 Soluna announced it had signed a contract to fill its 25 MW capacity at Project Dorothy 1A with two strategic hosting partners, including Compass Mining.\n\nSoluna completed deployment of Project Dorothy 1A\u2019s hosting customers with 100% of the site deployed.\n\nThe revenue potential for this site, operating at 25 MW, is projected to reach $16.47 million on an annualized basis. (As of Earnings Power Illustration June 21, 2023.)\n\nProject Dorothy 1B (Prop-Mining):\n\nIn May, the Company announced its $14 million Prop-Mining Joint Venture with Navitas Global.\n\nThe Company completed its tender of equipment purchase, with more than 8,250 machines purchased for a total of 860 PH/s of hashrate with an average efficiency of 29.9 J/TH, and at a cost of $11.25 $/TH inclusive of all fees, import, and taxes.\n\nMachines continue to ramp with 3,600 deployed to-date. The remaining are expected to be complete by the end of August.\n\nThe revenue potential for this site, operating at 25 MW, is projected to reach $17.78 million. (As of Earnings Power Illustration June 21, 2023.)\n\nAdditional Company Updates:\n\nProject Kati continues the development process, completing the first of the three required ERCOT interconnection studies in the planning phase. It has also advanced legal agreements with its power partner.\n\nThe Company is on track to end the quarter with a strong cash balance as will be presented in its 10-Q in August.\n\nNote(s):\n\n1 Under GAAP accounting rules, the new Project Sophie hosting contract revenue does not include power cost as it is a passthrough cost.

        "title": "Bitcoin is not 'crypto' - CoinGeek",
        "content": "It\u2019s time for another myth-dashing. When somebody mentions the now-passe crypto industry, what is the first thing that comes to your mind? Was it Bitcoin? Well, if it was, you have nothing to be ashamed of. That is what most people will say. But would it surprise you that there isn\u2019t any basis for this word being used in conjunction with Bitcoin?\n\nThat\u2019s right. There is no crypto in Bitcoin.\n\nWhen people use the word crypto, they are just using the short form for cryptography, which is the use of tools and codes to create messages that can only be read by the intended recipient. They use this word synonymous with encryption, which is often (incorrectly) quoted as one of the reasons why Bitcoin is secure and immutable.\n\nSadly, this is far from reality, and the reasons for this would weave a rich tapestry of history.\n\nLet\u2019s first go over the main false reasons why the word encryption and crypto became associated with Bitcoin. First, the word encryption or cryptography doesn\u2019t appear anywhere in the Bitcoin white paper. \u201cCryptographic proofs\u201d are mentioned in the white paper, and the difference between these and cryptography is significant.\n\nCryptography, again, is the general use of codes to ensure that a message is only readable by the intended recipient. In other words, used to pass secret messages around on a public channel. This word is commonly used synonymously with encryption/decryption of messages. It is concerned with sending and receiving secret messages.\n\nCryptographic proof, however, is the act of using cryptographic primitive functions in order to generate irrefutable public proof that a specific sender sent a message. The message itself is public, and the identity of the sender of the message is verified.\n\nIn a way, one is the opposite of the other. While one concerns itself with keeping secret messages, the other concerns itself with the public attestation of messages.\n\nHowever, because the terms share the same root prefix of \u201ccrypto,\u201d the term, which may have initially been incorrectly used, somehow stuck. Rest assured, there is no encryption in Bitcoin. Nothing is encrypted, and there are no secrets. In fact, its security model depends on full transparency in all transactions1 rather than keeping secrets.\n\nThe white paper was first published on the cryptography mailing list.\n\nThis is another possible source of the mis-association because the original Bitcoin White Paper was put into this forum, where the participants included many forefront experts in the field of cryptography. The assumption was that Bitcoin must have been a continuation of previous attempts at electronic cash projects (such as David Chaum\u2019s ecash), which did use encryption as part of their system.\n\nPublic and Private keys are used\n\nAsymmetric public key cryptography is another possible reason. ECDSA, which stands for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, uses the same mathematical primitives as ECC (elliptic curve cryptography) and, as such, also uses an asymmetric key pair of public and private keys. This is synonymous with other cryptography algorithms which use a public key to encrypt messages and a private key to decrypt them.\n\nHowever, these keys are not used to encrypt or decrypt anything. They are used to verify publicly that the signer of a transaction moving a coin is the correct person, as specified by the previous sender. In other words, if Alice sent a coin to Bob, then Bitcoin uses ECDSA to ensure that when Bob further signs and sends the coin to Charlie, that Bob is indeed the only one able to create this signature. This prevents someone else from spending Bob\u2019s coins, and it also ensures that whoever Bob sends the coins to can only be moved by that recipient.\n\nIndeed, locking coins to a specific public key to which the owner of the associated private key can be the sole controller is just one of the many ways a coin can be locked. It is certainly not mandatory. Coins can be locked to multiple keys, making it effectively a shared account, or even locked to something not key-related at all, instead locking the coins to a certain locking script2. All of these are fancy Bitcoin applications that have only recently begun to be explored3.\n\nSo, why, then, if there is no mention of crypto or encryption in the white paper, no use of cryptography, or encryption in the protocol, do many people believe that Bitcoin is secured by encryption? Or why is Bitcoin called a crypto-currency?\n\nWell, the term crypto-currency predates Bitcoin. In fact, as mentioned, previous attempts at electronic cash were called crypto-currencies, and they indeed featured encryption as a way to hide the amounts being sent as a form of privacy protection. This name just sort of stuck around because Bitcoin seemed like just \u2018another of the bunch.\u2019\n\nThe other, more nefarious reason is that many of the Bitcoin \u2018OGs\u2019 have a lot riding on Bitcoin and its price appreciation, and they realize that having Bitcoin associated with encryption and cryptography is a way to make it seem that it can be used to hide your transactions away from prying eyes or government scrutiny. After all, if newcomer \u2018whales\u2019 with heaps of illegitimate funds knew that every transaction that they ever make would be forever recorded and scrutable by authorities, they would very likely not be interested in using Bitcoin, instead preferring the tried and true method of shadow banks, money mules, and Rolex dealers. So there is an incentive for those who know better to keep tight-lipped if opening it means threatening price depreciation of your retirement slush fund. If you know any self-proclaimed OGs, ask them where the encryption is in Bitcoin and see what they say.\n\nBitcoin is a transparent system with a security model based on transparency. Because nodes (miners) are public, and they rely on their blocks being accepted by their competitors, keeping honest is the economic \u2018best move\u2019. When everything that you do needs to be confirmed by your peers, lest they reject your blocks, wasting your work, nodes tend to act honestly and according to the rules. Any and all rules can be enforced using this model. Importantly, this model does not rely on keeping any secrets at all.\n\nSo next time you talk to a Bitcoin supporter, who calls it \u2018crypto,\u2019 tell them there is no encryption or secrets at all in Bitcoin, and that is exactly what makes it work, where all other previous attempts at electronic cash failed.\n\nJerry Chan\n\nWall Street Technologist\n\nNOTES:\n\n[1] This is how miners can detect when another node is being dishonest and can vote to ignore their proof of work and reject their blocks. The threat of peer boycott of mining node blocks is what keeps all the mining nodes in line. Not social consensus or even developers.\n\n[2] Bitcoin contains an internal script language, a derivative of FORTH, which can be used to program custom locking scripts in order to program the spendability of coins.\n\n[3] Mostly by projects in BSV blockchain such as STAS and SCrypt\n\nCoinGeek Conversations with Owen Vaughan: Using modern advances in cryptography to enhance data privacy\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe creator of the hugely popular AI bot ChatGPT has launched a controversial project that offers users a free share of cryptocurrency in exchange for their biometric data.\n\nNearly four years after founding Worldcoin, OpenAI boss Sam Altman announced on Monday that the crypto wallet and app is now available in countries where it is not banned for regulatory or legal reasons.\n\nMore than 1.5 million people signed up to the venture prior to its official launch, each receiving a share of Worldcoin tokens in exchange for scanning their iris using a silver orb developed by the startup.\n\nThe biometric data was used to verify each individual\u2019s \u201cunique personhood\u201d and ensure that no one signed up more than once.\n\nEach person will now be able to use the Worldcoin token, which is currently valued at $2.59 (\u00a32), according to CoinMarketCap, having begun trading on Monday just below $2.\n\nWorldcoin (WLD) is similar to other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, in that it uses blockchain technology to enable digital transactions. According to its website, people can use it for \u201cremittances, [to] tip artists, [and] buy and sell goods and services\u201d.\n\nThe main differentiator is the way that users sign up, with privacy advocates warning that it could lead to a black market of people\u2019s iris scans.\n\nWorldcoin uses a metal orb to capture people\u2019s biometric data, which they can then use to acquire cryptocurrency (Worldcoin)\n\nWorldcoin has defended its technology by claiming that its orb is only used to check that a person is unique and has not signed up before.\n\nThe startup\u2019s website states: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to know who you are, just that you are unique\u201d.\n\nWorldcoin co-founder Alex Blania wrote in a note published on Monday that he believed Worldcoin \u201ccould drastically increase economic opportunity, scale a reliable solution for distinguishing humans from AI online while preserving privacy, enable democratic processes, and eventually show a potential path to AI-funded universal basic income.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWorldcoin is an attempt at global scale alignment, the journey will be challenging and outcome is uncertain. But finding new ways to broadly share the coming technological prosperity is a critical challenge of our time.\u201d\n\nWorldcoin does not list the countries in which it operates \u2013 The Independent has reached out for further information \u2013 though it is not yet available in Mr Altman\u2019s native US.\n\nThe startup founder was only able to sign up himself on a trip to Europe earlier this year.\n\n\u201cLike any really ambitious project, maybe it works out and maybe it doesn\u2019t, but trying stuff like this is how progress happens,\u201d Mr Altman tweeted following Worldcoin\u2019s launch.\n\n\u201cIn either case, we especially love our haters, it gives us energy, please keep it coming.\u201d"

        "title": "Top Indicators of CoinGecko's Report Q2-2023 - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Going in order, we can see that in Q2-2023, there are a lot of events in the crypto industry.\n\nLet\u2019s discover them in the latest CoinGecko\u2019s report:\n\n1) BTC Closed With a Gain of 6.9%\n\nOutperforming the market that increased by 0.14 % in capitalization from $1.238 trillion to $1.240 trillion.\n\nBitcoin, buoyed by enthusiasm dictated by various applications for a spot ETF by Blackrock and other asset management firms, has risen from $28,517 to $30,481 in the past 3 months.\n\n2) Stablecoins.\n\nOn the stablecoin front, we see how their spread in the markets decreased by 3.5%, with USDC and BUSD being the main losers: In total, the market cap of stablecoins decreased by $4.6 billion (-3.5%).\n\nTether, on the other hand, stands as the exception to the rule, as the USDT coin added 4.4% to market capitalization, an increase of $3.48 billion.\n\nRecently, the main cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar index, touched its all-time high at $83 billion closing the quarter with a 66% market share in the context of stablecoins.\n\n3) ETH Staking Growth\n\nA niche that is definitely growing, according to Coingecko\u2019s report, is ETH staking, which grew 30.3% in Q2 2023 after the Shapella update enabled withdrawals to the Beacon Chain. A total of 5.6 million ETH were added to the staking platform, for a total of 23.6 million coins.\n\nIn this context, Lido has flexed its muscles, establishing itself as the leading provider of liquid staking of ETH. The protocol now holds 31.9% of all ETH put into staking.\n\n4) Decrease in Spot Trading Volume on Centralized Exchanges\n\nAnother factor to pay attention to is the crisis in centralized exchanges, whose overall spot volume declined by 43.2% in the last quarter.\n\nDespite the small positive signs shown in Q1 2023, the number of trades and the total value transacted remains low when compared to the bull market months of 2021. Binance confirms its dominance in the industry, though it is seeing its market share drop from 61% to 52%.\n\nHuobii and Crypto.com also suffered heavy downsizing, dropping out of the top 10 exchanges by registered volume, making way for Bybit and Bitget.\n\n5) Drop in Spot Trading Volume on Decentralized Exchanges\n\nFinally, the last focal point of Congecko\u2019s crypto analysis is the context of decentralized exchanges. Total DEX volume in the last quarter decreased by 28.1% in a situation where Uniswap is still in control, with a 70% market share.\n\nWhile experiencing significant increases with the advent of PEPE that drove the meme coin craze, decentralized exchanges have not been able to overcome the obstacle of low liquidity and lack of investor attention. Better times will come for this segment of decentralized finance.\n\nCrypto Report Focus on NFT\n\nThe topic of NFTs was examined in great detail in Coingecko\u2019s crypto report.\n\nDuring the second quarter of this year, volumes in the non-fungible tokens market saw a sharp drop of 35% from $4.84 billion in the first quarter to the current $3.15 billion.\n\nThe Ordinals trend, which has also brought many benefits to Bitcoin miners who have seen their earnings increase, has failed on its own to lift the overall situation of the NFT sector.\n\nIndeed, the latter suffers from the lack of an overall positive outlook, which could boost speculation on this type of asset class, now forgotten by a large number of investors.\n\nIf we take a look at the floor prices recorded in the most popular collections on Ethereum, such as Bored Ape Yacht Club or Crypto Punks, we realize the huge drop in prices compared to the values of 2021, where the market for non-fungible tokens was skyrocketing.\n\nBelow is a tweet from well-known collector Franklin and BAYC brand advocate showing how nothing has gone wrong in the last period.\n\nThis NFT was once worth $3 million. Now it\u2019s only worth $65,000. What went wrong? pic.twitter.com/DKxsmD6mgI \u2014 Franklin (@franklinisbored) July 17, 2023\n\nAgainst the disastrous backdrop highlighted by Coingecko\u2019s crypto report, the Ethereum blockchain can still boast dominance in NFT trading in Q2 2023.\n\n83% of the total volume was recorded on the main smart contract infrastructure, with several ups and downs seeing it touch 73.3% as of May 2023.\n\nMore About the Crypto Report Focus on NFT\n\nSolana, on the other hand, stands as the biggest loser in this particular niche, having lost about 78.6% of volume, falling from $184.91 million in Q1 to the current $39.66 million. The main reason for this negative flow likely relates to the migration of the chain\u2019s main NFT collections, namely DeGods and y00ts to Ethereum and Polygon.\n\nAs for Bitcoin, whose exposure in the NFT scene was completely absent prior to the advent of Ordinals and the BRC-20 standard, it can now boast the second position in the chain ranking in terms of monthly recorded volumes. As is shown by Coingecko\u2019s crypto study, in May 2023 the trend peaked, with a total value traded on Bitcoin of $196 million.\n\nAlthough the total amount traded has now decreased, we could expect pleasant surprises in the context of NFTs on Bitcoin given the growing interest on the part of developers in making this world increasingly concrete and competitive with Ethereum.\n\nVitalik Buterin, founding father of the quintessential decentralized application platform, also believes that the development of alternatives such as protocols for NFTs or layer 2 scaling solutions on Bitcoin (in general the \u201cbuilder culture\u201c) are excellent initiatives that can bring huge future benefits.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have rapidly gained popularity and are changing the landscape of modern finance.\n\nHowever, explaining this complex and evolving concept to family and friends who may not be familiar with it can be a challenging task. In this article, we\u2019ll explore some tips on how to effectively explain about crypto to your loved ones and help them understand this exciting new world of digital assets.\n\nStart with the Basics\n\nBefore diving into technical jargon and complex concepts, begin by explaining the foundational principles. Define what a cryptocurrency is. For example, you can say this: \u201cCryptocurrencies is a digital or virtual form of money that uses cryptography for secure transactions and operates on a decentralized network called blockchain\u201d.\n\nStruggled to explain crypto and decentralization to your family over thanksgiving dinner? Listen and learn from the legend @jarroddicker and maybe you\u2019ll have better luck over the winter holidays. \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f https://t.co/DVu53H6cFT\n\n\ud83d\udcf9 https://t.co/QIWMi8x1uF pic.twitter.com/9o5pDgteBv \u2014 RabbitHole (@rabbithole_gg) November 29, 2021\n\nYou will need to emphasize that cryptocurrencies are not physical coins but exist solely in digital form. Here are some things to use to explain:\n\nUse Analogies\n\nAnalogies can be powerful tools for simplifying complex ideas. You can compare cryptocurrencies to concepts your family and friends are already familiar with. For instance, you can liken blockchain to a digital ledger, where all transactions are recorded in a transparent and immutable manner, similar to a shared Google Doc that everyone can see and verify.\n\nHighlight the Benefits\n\nYou can also mention advantages like fast and low-cost cross-border transactions, financial inclusion for the unbanked, and the potential for decentralized finance (DeFi) to provide financial services without intermediaries.\n\nAddress Concerns\n\nAcknowledging common concerns and misconceptions about cryptocurrencies is essential. So, you can address issues related to volatility, security, and illicit activities, explaining that like any investment or financial tool, it carries risks but can be managed responsibly with proper research and caution.\n\n\ud83c\udf85 How do you explain Cardano to the family this holiday season? You may be taking some time out from #crypto this holiday \ud83c\udf84 But if table talk does flow towards #Cardano, here\u2019s your conversation starter\u2026\ud83d\ude09https://t.co/fGqxHRr3Zr \u2014 Input Output (@InputOutputHK) December 23, 2021\n\nDemonstrate Real-World Use Cases\n\nTo make cryptocurrencies more relatable, share real-world examples of how they are being used. Mention how some businesses accept cryptocurrencies as payment, how individuals can send money globally without exorbitant fees, or how blockchain technology is being implemented in supply chain management.\n\nExplain the Role of Mining\n\nThe concept of mining can be baffling for newcomers. Offer a simplified explanation that mining involves computers solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. This process ensures the security and integrity of the network.\n\nDiscuss Different Cryptocurrencies\n\nIntroduce the idea that there are thousands of altcoins, each serving different purposes. Mention well-known ones like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple, and explain their unique characteristics, use cases, and strengths.\n\nEmphasize the Importance of Security\n\nEducate your family and friends about the significance of securing their cryptocurrency holdings. Explain the use of private keys and wallets, and stress the importance of never sharing sensitive information or passwords with anyone.\n\nIt\u2019s up to us to bring over the next wave of #Bitcoin & crypto users \ud83d\udc6b Learn how to explain crypto to your friends, family, coworkers, zoomers & boomers in our latest blog. https://t.co/6aQ9WOZSMf \u2014 Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) August 7, 2021\n\nSuggest Starting Small\n\nIf your loved ones express interest in investing, advise them to start with a small amount they can afford to lose. Stress that investing in cryptocurrencies, like any other investment, carries risks, and it\u2019s crucial to diversify their portfolio and exercise caution.\n\nRecommend Reputable Resources\n\nProvide reliable sources of information, such as educational websites, tutorials, and reputable news outlets that cover cryptocurrencies like Altcoin Buzz. Encourage them to stay informed and updated on developments in the crypto space.\n\nConclusion\n\nExplaining cryptocurrencies to family and friends can be a rewarding experience. Remember to be patient and understanding as they navigate this new territory. Breaking down the complexities and offering practical examples can make the subject more approachable.\n\nBy providing insights into the benefits, risks, and responsible investing practices, you can empower your loved ones to make informed decisions and explore the world of cryptocurrencies with confidence. As they delve deeper into this fascinating realm, they will undoubtedly appreciate your guidance and willingness to share knowledge about this transformative technology.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

Delve into the depths of research findings from various crypto sources, and gain a deep understanding of the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Unravel essential questions and uncover the top coins set to make waves before the next crypto bull market. Brace yourself for a thrilling adventure as we explore leading crypto projects that could ignite excitement in anticipation of the epic Bitcoin bull run.\n\nTop Crypto Bull Run Predictions\n\nThe upcoming halving event for Bitcoin in April 2024 has the potential to cause a decrease in supply, historically associated with bull market periods.\n\nBy the end of 2023, the completion of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade could significantly improve scalability, attracting a larger user base which may or may not positively impact the overall crypto market.\n\nThe maturation of crypto infrastructure is facilitating the realization of decentralized applications (dApps), unlocking their full potential and attracting genuine users.\n\nThe convergence of crypto, AI, and the metaverse could spur rapid growth and innovation within the crypto space.\n\nThe predictions mentioned above are speculative projections and should be approached with a healthy dose of skepticism, given the inherent unpredictability of the crypto market and Bitcoin\u2019s dynamics. It is crucial to acknowledge that the future of cryptocurrencies remains uncertain, making precise predictions impossible.\n\nWhat is ApeMax?\n\nApeMax is an innovative new cryptocurrency that has gained traction in the crypto community due to its unique boost-to-earn staking tokenomics.

ApeMax also operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), reducing gas costs and providing seamless utility.\n\nWhat is the ApeMax Presale?\n\nThe ApeMax Presale is an exclusive opportunity for early eligible buyers to purchase ApeMax coins at presale prices. Through lootboxes, eligible early buyers can also enjoy discounts of up to 50% on their tokens. This top new presale event allows participants to find out about a new and exciting project.\n\nWhat is the Bitcoin Halving Event?\n\nThe Bitcoin Halving Event is a pre-programmed process that occurs approximately every four years when the block rewards for Bitcoin miners are cut in half. This event aims to control the issuance of new Bitcoins, reducing the rate of supply growth. Historically, halvings have been associated with bull market periods, as the reduced supply may increase demand and drive up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nIs ApeMax the Next Big Crypto?\n\nWhile ApeMax shows promise and could be the next big crypto and has gained attention in the crypto space, no one can predict with certainty whether it will become the number one next big crypto. The crypto market is highly unpredictable, and many factors influence the success of a cryptocurrency. However, ApeMax\u2019s unique features and growing popularity make it an intriguing project to keep an eye on in the crypto space.\n\nWhy Should I Buy ApeMax?\n\nApeMax introduces an innovative boost-to-earn staking tokenomics model, providing holders with the opportunity to earn rewards.

Diligently conducting comprehensive research, seeking counsel from impartial experts, and evaluating your personal risk tolerance are crucial elements. Furthermore, understand that cryptocurrencies may not be suitable for all individuals. All cryptocurrencies inherently carry elevated risks and volatility. Moreover, individuals from the United States, Canada, countries under sanctions, and other blocked countries are not permitted to purchase ApeMax coins.

        "content": "Shortly after OpenAI launched its text-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT, the technology saw renewed interest, leading to the rise of other generative AI bots, particularly Google\u2019s Bard, which has already demonstrated its value in the cryptocurrency market analysis, including that of Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIndeed, as the price of Bitcoin continues to move sideways after losing the $30,000 level, Finbold sought Bard\u2019s input on the future of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset after its halving in 2024, from a standpoint as of July 25.\n\nFactors playing a role\n\nAs it happens, Bard delivered a detailed reply, highlighting that \u201cthere are a number of factors that suggest that the price could reach new highs,\u201d including the upcoming halving event itself, increased global adoption of Bitcoin, and favorable regulatory frameworks around the world.\n\nBitcoin analysis. Source: Google Bard\n\nOn the other hand, Bard singled out the factors that could hamper Bitcoin\u2019s gains after the halving, particularly the possibility of a bear market following the halving, as well as the rise of competing crypto assets that could pose a threat to its dominance.\n\nBitcoin price prediction\n\nIn terms of specific numbers, Bard has listed Bitcoin price predictions from several different sources, including the stock-to-flow (S2F) model by crypto analyst PlanB, which has set the price of the maiden cryptocurrency at $100,000 by 2024.\n\nFurthermore, the second prediction, by British multinational bank Standard Chartered, projects Bitcoin to reach $120,000 by 2024, whereas India\u2019s oldest cryptocurrency exchange, ZebPay, is not as bullish, setting the price of the largest crypto by market capitalization at $40,000 by 2024.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time changing hands at the price of $29,125, which represents a decline of 2.33% in the last 24 hours, a 2.97% loss across the previous seven days, adding up to the 5.20% drop on its monthly chart, as per the latest information.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is facing the strongest support at the price of $27,583, whereas its resistance rests on the $31,010 level. Whether it can truly reach one of the price thresholds predicted above will depend on the various listed factors playing together.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin price has barely moved in weeks, resulting in what is now the lowest volatility ever according to Bollinger Band Width on the one-week timeframe.\n\nHere is a closer look at what this could mean for the undisputed king of crypto.\n\nWeekly Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Become Tightest Ever\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are known best for their notorious volatility and wild price fluctuations. Coins have commonly rallied by several hundred to several thousand percent, only to retrace and wipe out 80 to 90% of the growth during a bear market.\n\nFollowing the longest bear market on record, BTCUSD had been at a standstill after reaching 30K resistance and could slowly be flipping the level into support. While this occurs, volatility has disappeared from the characteristically chaotic crypto space.\n\nVolatility has dropped so low, it has caused the Bollinger Bands on the weekly timeframe to tighten to the most narrow width in the history of the first ever cryptocurrency. Whether it is Bitcoin or another asset, lulls in price action end with an enormous boom or bust.\n\nWhen will explosive volatility return? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nWhy A History-Making Move Is On The Horizon In Crypto\n\nBollinger Band Width reaching all-time lows doesn\u2019t say much about the direction of price action when the breakout ultimately occurs. What it does tell us in advance, is that an enormous move is coming \u2014 possibly one of the most powerful in the asset\u2019s entire history.\n\nPast instances of low volatility and tight weekly Bollinger Band Width always end with a bang. Sometimes these result in a boom cycle and a rally, while other times there was a severe breakdown.\n\nFor example, tightening nearly this much in 2016 led to the bull market that made Bitcoin a household name. In 2018, a period of tranquility ended with another 50% drop to conclude the bear market.\n\nWhatever the outcome this time around, it will almost certainly be a move for the history books."
