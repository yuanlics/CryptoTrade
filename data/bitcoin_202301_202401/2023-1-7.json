        "title": "Bitcoin or gold? Beware the \u2018malignant tumor,\u2019 says \u2018Black Swan\u2019 guru Nassim Nicholas Taleb - Fortune",
        "content": "Is Bitcoin or gold the better investment? Opinions vary widely, with billionaire crypto fan Mark Cuban favoring Bitcoin\u2014and slamming gold\u2014and Euro Pacific Capital CEO Peter Schiff going the other way.\n\nNassim Nicholas Taleb has some thoughts too. This week the author of the 2010 New York Times bestseller The Black Swan\u2014among the few who foresaw the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis\u2014weighed in on the debate in an interview with the French weekly L\u2019Express.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say Bitcoin, which has fallen more than 60% since the start of 2022, fails to impress him.\n\n\u201cTechnology comes and goes\u201d\n\nOne problem with Bitcoin, he said, is that \u201cwe are not sure of the interests, mentalities, and preferences of future generations. Technology comes and goes; gold stays, at least physically. Once neglected for a brief period, Bitcoin would necessarily collapse.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he said, \u201cit cannot be expected that an entry on a register that requires active maintenance by interested and motivated people\u2014this is how Bitcoin works\u2014will retain its physical properties, a condition for monetary value, for any period of time.\u201d\n\nAsked about the origins of the \u201ccraze for cryptocurrencies,\u201d he pointed to the low interest rates of the past 15 years.\n\n\u201cLowering rates creates asset bubbles without necessarily helping the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cCapital no longer costs anything; risk-free returns on investment become too low, even negative, pushing people into speculation. We lose our sense of what a long-term investment is. It is the end of real finance.\u201d\n\nOne of the results, he argued, was \u201cmalignant tumors like Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ceverything bubble\u201d\n\nTaleb isn\u2019t alone in noting the effects of what\u2019s been dubbed the \u201ceverything bubble\u201d\u2014created by years of loose monetary policies from the Fed and other central banks following the Great Financial Crisis. As Fortune reported this week, the easy money era was filled with bulls\u2014from crypto experts to hedge fund managers to economists and investment banks\u2014who believed the good times would never end.\n\nInterestingly, Taleb was supportive of Bitcoin early on. At the time, as he explained to L\u2019Express, he was critical of then Fed Chair Ben Bernanke.\n\nBernanke, he said, did not see the structural risks of the system before the 2008 crisis, and overreacted afterward: \u201cInstead of correcting debt and mitigating hidden risks, he covered them with a monetary policy that was only supposed to be transitory. I wrongly thought Bitcoin would be a bulwark against the distortions of this monetary policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cManipulators and scammers\u201d\n\nTaleb also warned that \u201cthe crypto universe attracts manipulators and scammers.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s certainly not alone there.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said at the a16z crypto Founder Summit in late November: \u201cWe have to kind of come to terms as an industry with the fact that, I think our industry is attracting a disproportionate share of fraudsters and scammers. And that\u2019s really unfortunate. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s representative of the whole industry.\u201d\n\n(Armstrong added it was \u201cbaffling\u201d to him why FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried wasn\u2019t already in custody\u2014a few weeks later, he was.)\n\nTaleb tweeted this week that he\u2019s been trolled and smeared for his crypto criticism, but that such attacks have been offset by the \u201cmany thank-you messages for saving young people from Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe shared a message in which a Twitter user said he almost bought Bitcoin but then started following Taleb\u2019s thinking on it, writing, \u201cI got why crypto is crap in theory. Then it went bust in practice. NNT saved my dad\u2019s hard earned money.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, many Bitcoin bulls remain bullish. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood recently reiterated her prediction that Bitcoin will hit $1 million by 2030\u2014it\u2019s now just below $17,000. She also argued Bankman-Fried didn\u2019t like \u201ctransparent and decentralized\u201d Bitcoin \u201cbecause he couldn\u2019t control it,\u201d saying the FTX fiasco was caused by \u201copaque centralized players.\u201d\n\nAs for Cuban, he said on Bill Maher\u2019s Club Random podcast last month, \u201cI want Bitcoin to go down a lot further so I can buy some more.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Sango Coin and the Central African Republic - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In the spring of 2022, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a legal tender.\n\nAs the second country globally to recognize Bitcoin in such a fashion, the CAR followed in El Salvador\u2019s footsteps. El Salvador has since boasted surging tourism numbers, a resilient economy and a healthy amount of free PR since allowing its citizens to make everyday purchases with the seminal cryptocurrency.\n\nThe CAR, a substantially less economically developed economy than its Central American counterpart, would hope to emulate El Salvador\u2019s success. Despite the nation\u2019s vast natural resource wealth, the CAR is plagued by economic mismanagement, meager private and foreign investment, and systemic governmental issues.\n\nIt is one of the poorest countries on the poorest continent in the world, ranking right at the bottom of the World Bank\u2019s Human Development Index. To make matters worse, up to 85% of the country\u2019s exports are kept in French treasuries, while its currency of choice, the CFA franc, is heavily biased toward economic development in France. Consequently, tapping into a neutral, open-source and censorship-resistant monetary system such as Bitcoin could not only benefit but emancipate the country.\n\nPresident Bitcoiners\n\nSimilar to El Salvador, the CAR law would make Bitcoin \u201cofficial money.\u201d Naturally, this decision was lauded by Bitcoin advocates the world over. Plus, it appeared that CAR President Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra, a mathematician and Bitcoin supporter on social media, was inclined to support the adoption of the unique cryptocurrency. The pro-Bitcoin tweets smack of El Salvador\u2019s laser-eyed president, Nayib Bukele.\n\nMathematics is the #language of the Universe.#Bitcoin is universal money. \u2014 Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra (@FA_Touadera) April 27, 2022\n\nHowever, celebration and support for the country among the Bitcoin community were short-lived as, despite formal visits by Bitcoin-only proponents \u2014 including Galoy Money \u2014 the country began its own token project. Just days after the Bitcoin law came into effect, the country surprised the crypto community by announcing the creation of a crypto token called Sango. The population of 5 million would also benefit from a \u201ccrypto hub\u201d in the capital, Bangui.\n\nA francophone contingent of established Bitcoiners visit the CAR in May. Source: Twitter\n\nCointelegraph sat down in Senegal, West Africa with Mamadou Moustapha Ly, the Central African technician who oversaw the development of Sango Coin, to ask about the project\u2019s development. A payments expert, Ly also runs the fintech startup Kete Cash. Ly shed light on the creation of what he called a \u201ctoken, not a currency,\u201d labeled Sango. Sango is the token that would accompany the country\u2019s plans to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nCointelegraph speaks to Ly in Senegal.\n\nFirst, Ly stressed that the Bitcoin-as-legal-tender law clearly states that the country will adopt Bitcoin. There is no mention of other cryptocurrencies or even Sango Coin. He painted a clear divide between Sango and Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cThe law states that the digital currency that is legal tender is Bitcoin. We recognize this as our official currency. [...] Sango coin is a project for the Central African Republic state.\u201d\n\nSango Coin offers attractive incentives to foreign investors, including citizenship by investment and eventually a CAR passport, as well as governance advantages. In a sense, buying Sango is a way of buying residency in the country, without touching government-issued fiat currencies.\n\nA token effort\n\nBut why was this necessary? El Salvador did not create a new token to support its Bitcoin adoption efforts \u2014 so, why would the CAR?\n\nTo compare the two country\u2019s Bitcoin adoption strategies, both countries announced Bitcoin as a legal tender. From that point onward, they diverge. In El Salvador, foreigners could initially buy residency with an investment of 3 BTC, although it was then rescinded. In the CAR, \u201ce-residency can be obtained [...] by locking a fixed collateral of SANGO Coins in the amount of 6000$ for a period of 3 years.\u201d Plus, foreign investors can directly access the country\u2019s strategic resources through the use of the crypto token, Ly explained.\n\nTo gain exposure to El Salvador\u2019s rapid development without touching Bitcoin, the Central American country teed up volcano bonds. The volcano or Bitcoin bonds support the creation of a \u201cBitcoin City\u201d and are backstopped by the government. In contrast, Sango is a cryptocurrency built on a blockchain \u201cbacked by Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe now-defunct Luna Classic (LUNC) token was the last time a token used Bitcoin as its treasury. The token\u2019s meltdown wiped billions of dollars from the crypto total market cap and dented confidence in the industry. So, why create a token? Why build a system liable to hacking or attack from malicious actors? And why do so despite the Bitcoin contingent\u2019s best interest to steer a Bitcoin-only path?\n\nLy explained that Sango is a \u201cgovernment project.\u201d Money raised through the sale of Sango Coin will be used to buy Bitcoin, which can then be used to acquire the materials necessary for development projects, as well as to pay for labor and other expenses.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note the country\u2019s dire financial situation. Reports continue to indicate that civil servants and government salaries are paid by its former colonizer, France, while the country is labeled a \u201crepressed\u201d economy according to the Heritage Foundation\u2019s 2022 Index of Economic Freedom.\n\nWhile Bitcoin advocates hail Bitcoin adoption as a panacea to most modern-day problems, in the CAR, the priorities are clean water, security, education then maybe internet connectivity. With these motivations, the country needs investment \u2014 fast.\n\nThe African franc.\n\nTo this point, Ly noted that the Central African Republic\u2019s high level of external debt makes it difficult for the country to access traditional forms of financing. Sango Coin could be that alternative source of funding. Indeed, one could infer that the quick liquidity provided by Sango is a way of jumpstarting much-needed foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country.\n\nRelated: \u2018We don\u2019t like our money\u2019: The story of the CFA and Bitcoin in Africa\n\nIn addition, the use of a crypto token allows for greater flexibility and speed in conducting financial transactions, as well as reducing the risk of fraud, he commented. In a sense, the use of Sango could sidestep the bureaucracy and slow administrative practices for which Central African governments are known. Plus, it could allow investment flows into the country without touching dollars or the local currency.\n\nWhen asked why the Central African Republic did not simply use Bitcoin or the superfast Lightning Network for these purposes, Ly reiterated that Sango Coin is intended to serve as a token associated with the government project: \u201cIt\u2019s not a general-purpose currency.\u201d\n\nSango could allow for greater control over the flow of funds, therefore reducing the risk of capital flight. In addition, the World Bank points out that the country will not be able to develop its human capital without strengthening domestic revenue mobilization sustainably. Sango could be the quickest path to more robust revenues.\n\nBitcoin on the ground\n\nPaco De La India, known as \u201cRun with Bitcoin,\u201d recently spent two weeks traveling in the CAR in the hopes of spending Bitcoin and interacting with Bitcoin people. He told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cThere was no not even a single business that accepted Bitcoin. I gave my guide a tip in Bitcoin. I paid my host in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWith those small successes aside, Paco told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin adoption on the ground was minimal. In a country where less than a quarter of the country has access to the internet \u2014 a basic requirement to use \u201cmagic internet money\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s hardly surprising.\n\nAs for the creation of Sango Coin, Paco suggested there could be external forces at play. The CAR is tremendously resource-rich, so why couldn\u2019t a French state-run project meddle with the creation of the token? he questioned. The token was indeed created quickly after state visits to one of the world\u2019s crypto hubs, Dubai.\n\nLy explained that foreign influences did have an effect on the decision-making process:\n\n\u201cThe idea for Sango Coin came from a private partner based in Dubai who discussed it with the Head of State.\u201d\n\nAnd a deal was struck with foreign investors, but there was no suggestion that the former colonial power may be using Sango Coin to control resources. It might simply be the quickest way to raise capital and, as Ly suggested, use this capital to buy Bitcoin and build the country\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nUltimately, Bitcoin adoption and the creation of Sango appear to be a ploy to inject much-needed FDI into the country and enhance the country\u2019s standing globally. However, the creation of this token may shun interest from the wider Bitcoin community, arguably the frontline investors to places and jurisdictions that announce their plans for Bitcoin."

        "title": "Here's My 2023 Prediction for Bitcoin, and It May Not Be What You Think - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It probably feels like forever, but just over a year ago, Bitcoin (BTC 2.61%) hit an all-time high just shy of $70,000. Since then, the world's first and most valuable cryptocurrency has dropped about 75% and finished 2022 posting a 65% loss.\n\nAlthough corrections are more than normal after meteoric rises -- like the one Bitcoin went on when it hit its previous all-time high -- 2022's decline was exacerbated by a series of events such as bankruptcies and scandals that rattled investor confidence. Subsequently, Bitcoin tanked.\n\nI know we could all use some reason for optimism in 2023, but I would prefer to be realistic at the same time. Personally, I am hopeful Bitcoin will treat investors much better this year -- especially if they take advantage of today's cheap prices.\n\n2023: The year before the next Bitcoin halving\n\nViewed as the bell cow of crypto because of its high value relative to the rest of the industry, as Bitcoin goes so go most other cryptocurrencies. And I think there's a chance Bitcoin will have a much better year in 2023 than in 2022 -- but probably not as good as in 2021.\n\nThat belief comes down to Bitcoin's price behavior at (and in between) halvings, a mechanism in the crypto's code that reduces the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation. These halvings occur roughly every four years, and the next one isn't set to happen until sometime in May 2024.\n\nIn the past, Bitcoin typically hit a bottom when the next halving was roughly a year and a half out. So with May 2024 less than 18 months away, that makes buying today extremely attractive since we have likely reached a bottom, and further risk looks to be minimal.\n\nBut of more importance is what Bitcoin does leading up to the halving. On average, Bitcoin's price is usually 50% of its previous all-time high when the next halving arrives. If it follows this pattern again, that would mean Bitcoin should be near $34,000 by May 2024.\n\nNow that's 2024. But I believe 2023 will be a year in which Bitcoin builds momentum to get closer to that $40,000 mark. By no means will this be a smooth ascension, though. The current backdrop of factors in the economy such as rising interest rates and persistent inflation will likely cause risk-on assets like Bitcoin to remain highly volatile.\n\nThe future won't necessarily unfold like it has in the past, but until proved wrong, I will remain a believer in the data.\n\nAs for a possible price target in 2023, I'm slightly hesitant to provide a specific number Bitcoin could reach, but as we get closer to the next halving, the data suggest that it could make some modest gains.\n\nEspecially when considering that after Bitcoin has a negative year, it averages a 70% return and has never posted a decline in consecutive years. If Bitcoin were to put in a 70% return in 2023, that would put its price at about $28,000.\n\nA word of caution\n\nAlthough predictions and speculation are common, and sometimes a little fun, we shouldn't use this as a reason to try to time the market. Rather, these data should be used to promote the profitability of long-term investing.\n\nMore so than any other asset in history, Bitcoin rewards those investors who keep the longest time frame. And with the recent price collapse of 2022, that strategy shouldn't change.\n\nHere's to hoping Bitcoin holders have a better year than 2022, and that 2023 is just the beginning for the crypto to reach a new all-time high in the coming years."

        "title": "Why MicroStrategy is Betting the Farm on Bitcoin - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "\u201cBitcoin is appreciating money. Bonds are crumbling credit. Build your future on a firm foundation.\u201d \u2013 Michael Saylor, CEO & Co-founder MicroStrategy\n\nIn November 2023, the software company MicroStrategy made a big gamble: it bought over 16,000 bitcoin, spending nearly $600 million.\n\nThen it threw them onto the pile of bitcoin it had been stockpiling, for a total of 175,000 bitcoin worth over $5 billion. This puts them on the Top 10 list of bitcoin holders, along with Binance, the U.S. government, and Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe reality is that MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor is betting the farm on BTC rather than taking a more conservative approach (such as our money-making blockchain investor portfolio).\n\nSo far, Saylor appears correct, as bitcoin has appreciated 221% since MicroStrategy adopted its bitcoin strategy, while bonds have diminished by 22%. But our take is that if you want exposure to bitcoin, it\u2019s simpler to just buy bitcoin rather than investing in MicroStrategy stock ($MSTR).\n\nWhat Does MicroStrategy Do?\n\nSince all the MicroStrategy news headlines are about bitcoin, it can be hard to remember that it\u2019s a business.\n\nMicroStrategy creates business intelligence software that helps businesses analyze and visualize large amounts of complex data. Competitor products would be Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, or Qlik.\n\nThe company has continuously innovated its products, making developing applications that tie into your data easier, providing extensive support for mobile users, and adding advanced AI capabilities.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s revenues have gradually declined over the past decade, though fortunes have improved somewhat over the past few years:\n\nMeanwhile, MicroStrategy\u2019s stock ($MSTR) has increased by over 200% since Saylor started stockpiling bitcoin in 2020. In fact, the stock has increased even faster than the price of bitcoin, making it an attractive option for investors who can\u2019t invest in bitcoin directly.\n\nOn the other hand, MicroStrategy\u2019s huge bitcoin stash makes the stock extremely volatile, as if you were buying bitcoin directly. Note its correlation with the price of BTC:\n\nSaylor\u2019s fixation on bitcoin has thrown the company\u2019s economics out of whack: in our view, when you buy $MSTR stock, you\u2019re not buying the business, you\u2019re buying bitcoin.\n\nThis begs the question: why not just buy bitcoin directly?\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin Strategy\n\nBy foraying into bitcoin on such a massive scale, MicroStrategy is not merely adopting a new corporate investing strategy. The company is challenging the conventional norms that have guided other publicly traded companies for over a century.\n\nHowever, this does pose considerable challenges related to regulatory compliance, stakeholder communications, and market optics.\n\nTo adequately address these issues, MicroStrategy has created a multi-pronged BTC strategy with the following core considerations:\n\nNarrative\n\nSwitching from traditional assets to crypto presents a giant leap that could alienate a significant section of investors and raise doubts in the minds of employees and other stakeholders.\n\nAny organization mulling this move must figure out a compelling narrative to present. In a market with limited avenues for exposure to BTC, MicroStrategy is positioning itself as a vehicle for investors interested in indirect exposure to crypto.\n\nAnd this strategy is working instead nicely so far. In 2023, while BTC gained 160%, MicroStrategy stocks surged by more than 350%.\n\nAccounting and Reporting\n\nHighly volatile crypto assets like BTC present significant challenges related to corporate accounting and disclosure of financial reports.\n\nFor instance, crypto investments have an elevated risk of impermanent loss. To accurately reflect this in financial reports, MicroStrategy will have to conduct more frequent impairment testing, a financial accounting process used to assess whether the carrying value of an asset on a company\u2019s balance sheet exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nThe constantly shifting valuation of BTC also impacts your ability to present an accurate estimation of market risks, future earnings, liquidity, quarterly results, and more.\n\nRisk Management\n\nCryptocurrency transactions are irreversible and almost anonymous. These strengths can pose major problems from a corporate investment perspective as they increase the risk of theft, fraud, and losses due to inadvertent transactions.\n\nCustody and Storage\n\nGiven the high risk of theft associated with \u201chot\u201d wallets, MicroStrategy considers \u201ccold\u201d wallets more appropriate for large-scale crypto holdings. They are also more convenient for risk disclosures.\n\nThe company relies on US-based qualified custodians to act as fiduciaries under relevant banking regulations. Multiple custodial accounts can offer some diversification. For large BTC transactions, MicroStrategy prefers relying on specialized brokers.\n\nMicroStrategy BTC Holdings vs Other Treasuries\n\nAs of January 2024, MicroStrategy owned 189,150 BTC, valued at over $8.4 billion. This represents 0.901% of the total BTC supply of 21 million coins. Here is how that stacks up against various other BTC treasuries.\n\nVs. Other Public Companies\n\nAmong public companies that own BTC, MicroStrategy is miles ahead of the rest of the chasing pack. The next biggest treasury on the list belongs to Marathon Digital Holdings, with 14,025 BTC worth $624 million. Honestly, that\u2019s not even close to being in the same league.\n\nThe total value of BTC held by public companies is around $12.3 billion, or 276,336. MicroStrategy currently holds more than 68% of the total BTC under the ownership of publicly traded companies.\n\nVs. Governments\n\nSovereign nations around the globe own a combined total of at least $20.1 billion, or 451,968BTC in their treasuries. That represents 1.316% of the entire supply of BTC.\n\nIf MicroStrategy were a country, it would rank third on the largest government-owned BTC treasuries list. The company is only behind the USA ($9.22 billion) and China ($8.63) billion in its bitcoin holdings.\n\nGovernments aren\u2019t investing in bitcoin, though. Most of the government-held bitcoin has been confiscated from criminal actors. The world\u2019s governments have no interest in the price movement of bitcoin.\n\nVs. Private Companies\n\nAfter filing for bankruptcy, Mt Gox, the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange, had bitcoin reserves of around 200,000 BTC worth $8.9 billion. Since most of it will be paid out to its creditors, that leaves Block as one as the next biggest privately-owned stash of BTC.\n\nThe blockchain software services company reportedly owns over 140,000 BTC, worth an estimated $6.2 billion at current rates. Other notable treasuries belong to entities like Tether Holdings ($2.44 billion), Tezos Foundation ($779 million), and Stone Ridge ($445 million).\n\nVs. ETFs\n\nOnly Grayscale Bitcoin Trust owns a bigger treasury than MicroStrategy among bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Not surprising, given that the purpose of an ETF is to purchase the asset represented by the ETF in hopes of making a profit for the fund holders. Grayscale has over 643,000 BTC valued at $28 billion, or 3.065% of the total supply.\n\nThe other significant ETFs all have smaller BTC holdings than MicroStrategy: Coinshares/XBT Provider ($2.1 billion), Purpose Bitcoin ($1.12 billion), and 3iQ Coinshares Bitcoin ($945 million) are the big ones.\n\nLearning From History\n\nSaylor is like a modern-day Scrooge McDuck, rolling around in his giant pile of bitcoin.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with saving cash for a rainy day, even a lot of it. Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook hold billions in cash and marketable securities, which gives them options when they need to acquire a competitor or move quickly into a new market.\n\nBut the historical performance of hoarding behavior is mixed, at best. For example:\n\nApple Hoarding Gold : Steve Jobs believed gold was the ultimate hedge against inflation. (Sound familiar?) So, Apple kept a vast gold reserve for much of the 1970s and 1980s. The company sold off most of its gold in the 1990s and was later criticized for not investing that money back into the business.\n\n: Steve Jobs believed gold was the ultimate hedge against inflation.

The practice continued until the late 2000s when sugar markets became more stable and globalized.\n\n: For much of the 20th century, Coca-Cola kept a strategic supply to protect its supply chain from sugar shortages and unexpected price increases.

Oil is one of Iran\u2019s most valuable assets, so the country keeps enormous oil reserves, which allows it economic and political leverage. But it brings the threat of fluctuating oil prices and international sanctions.\n\n: An excellent example of resource stockpiling on a national scale.

De Beers Hoarding Diamonds: When the company monopolized diamonds, they kept a stockpile of the precious gems to manipulate prices and maintain market dominance. Thankfully, better regulations and smarter consumers have forced De Beers to diversify their holdings.\n\nSometimes, hoarding works for a while. However, we believe that resources are usually better spent on growing the business, especially in the fast-moving technology industry. Long-term, Scrooge McDuck would probably be better off investing in his nephew\u2019s new ideas.\n\nMicroStrategy BTC Purchases Over Time\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s three biggest BTC purchases were all made in their first year of BTC investing \u2013 starting in August 2020. By the end of the year, the company had amassed a BTC treasury valued at $1.125 billion.\n\nIn 2021, MicroStrategy made 14 different BTC purchases. The biggest of these was a $1.02 billion transaction on February 24. By the end of 2021, the company's BTC reserves had tripled to $3.75 billion.\n\nThe activity was relatively muted in 2022, as MicroStrategy only added around $250 million to its BTC reserves over the entire year. However, things have accelerated in 2023, with seven major purchases pushing its reserves close to $6 billion.\n\nMicroStrategy Financial Performance\n\nWhile assessing MicroStrategy\u2019s (MSTR) financial performance, it is essential to factor in the actual impact of impairment charges/impermanent losses.\n\nThe company's operating revenues have remained relatively stagnant since 2017, staying close to the $500 million line.\n\nHowever, since its BTC investment strategy began, operating income has fallen drastically due to the reporting of impairment losses.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, the company reported net income losses to $535 million and $1.46 billion, despite posting a gross profit of close to $400 million in both years.\n\nThis gives a somewhat inaccurate impression of the company's current performance, especially since it plans to hold BTC long-term. The numbers could bounce back in the future when the BTC prices rise.\n\nYou can see this disparity in the performance of the $MSTR stock. From a price of $166 in early January 2023, the stock had risen to $665 by the end of the year, indicating a 1Y price performance of +400. On December 29, it had a P/E ratio of 489.44.\n\nMicroStrategy Vs Competitors\n\nThe main competitors of MicroStrategy in the prepackaged software industry niche include Guidewire Software (GWRE), SS&C Technologies (SSNC), Blackbaud (BLKB), Instructure (INST), Commvault Systems (CVLT), ACI Worldwide (ACIW), Tyler Technologies (TYL), Progress Software (PRGS), Sapiens International (SPNS), and ANSYS (ANSS).\n\nLet us look closely at some of these competitors for a fair idea of MicroStrategy\u2019s overall performance.\n\nGuidewire Software (GWRE)\n\nDespite a slightly lower market cap of $8.75 billion, GWRE boasts a better revenue than MSTR. The reported revenues of $905 million are more than double the average reported by MSRT in recent years. However, the 1Y price performance is only +70, and the P/E ratio is -125.59.\n\nInstructure (INST)\n\nThe market cap of this firm is $3.74 billion, or around one-third of MSTR. Instructure also reported comparable revenues of $475.19 million in 2023. Despite that, the demand for the stock remains rather tepid, with a 1Y price performance of +10.9%. The P/E ratio is likewise in the negative at -108.29.\n\nTyler Technologies (TYL)\n\nTYL is a more prominent company than MSTR, with a market cap of $17.19 billion. It also reported nearly 5x the latter's revenues at $1.85 billion. The 1Y price performance is positive at +26.6%. and the P/E ratio is also quite good at 110.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nFrom a cursory glance at the competition, it is pretty clear that MicroStrategy stock is overperforming despite relatively lackluster financials and revenue reports. The investor interest generated by the company\u2019s exposure to BTC is probably the only reason for its highly inflated P/E ratio.\n\nProblems with the SEC\n\nEven before its pivot to BTC, MicroStrategy has had past run-ins with the SEC. In 2000, the SEC filed fraud charges against the company for allegedly overstating its revenues and earnings for the preceding two years.\n\nDespite suffering losses between 1997 and 2000, MicroStrategy was alleged to have reported material gains in the run-up to its IPO in 1998. Immediately after the civil accounting fraud charges were filed, MicroStrategy reached a settlement deal with the SEC.\n\nThe company agreed to pay a fine of $11 million to settle cases. The penalties were paid by three top executives at the firm, including current CEO Michael Saylor, who paid $8.3 million. However, the settlement did not involve any admission of wrongdoing by MicroStrategy.\n\nAs part of the deal, MicroStrategy also agreed to restate financial results for 1998 and 1999. The company stock dropped 60% of its value within a day due to the fraud charges. From a peak of $333, it finally bottomed out at $33.\n\nThe Risk of Betting the Business on Bitcoin\n\nIn our investing approach, we recognize that bitcoin is risky: a roller-coaster. That\u2019s why we hedge that risk by investing primarily in common stocks and bonds, with just a portion of our portfolio allocated to bitcoin:\n\nYou\u2019ve got to wonder why Saylor doesn\u2019t do the same. Why not hedge the risk of bitcoin with other investments \u2013 even gold?\n\nBy putting everything into bitcoin, he\u2019s doing the thing we constantly warn you about. We don\u2019t bet the farm on bitcoin.\n\nOnly in Saylor\u2019s case, he\u2019s betting the business on bitcoin.\n\nTrue, it\u2019s unlikely that bitcoin will go to zero. True, it\u2019s possible that his bitcoin investment could be 10x.\n\nAnd then what? Buy more bitcoin?\n\nInvestor Takeaway: Lots of Risk, Uncertain Reward\n\nUltimately, the purpose of a business is to generate new value for the world. If MicroStrategy is buying bitcoin without reinvesting it, investors should ask what the business really does. Is it a bitcoin holding company with a bit of software business?\n\nIf so, where is the value in that?\n\nMake no mistake: we\u2019re bitcoin believers. More importantly, we\u2019re believers in a new financial system. Here, MicroStrategy has enormous potential: it could use its considerable expertise to develop new financial software products or services that bring the world into the crypto age.\n\nBut sitting on top of a $5 billion bitcoin stash subjects the company to wild market uncertainty. It puts MicroStrategy on the bitcoin roller coaster. Lots of risk, with uncertain reward.\n\nFor investors who want to invest in bitcoin, our solution is simple: invest in bitcoin. Not MicroStrategy."

        "title": "Michael Saylor and the Philosophy of Bitcoin Maximalism - DailyCoin",
        "content": "In 2020, Micheal Saylor made a shocking announcement on an earning call with shareholders. He painted a bleak picture for the future of fiat currency and argued that the returns from holding cash were falling, and the strength of the dollar was fading.\n\nConsequentially, Saylor argued, the smartest thing would be to hold the currency of the future instead of fiat. He said the future was Bitcoin, which was attractive because it was a dependable store of value.\n\nSaylor said he believed that the way forward for MicroStrategy was to buy Bitcoin with its cash reserves. At the time, MicroStrategy had reserves of about $550 million. Since the company only needed around $50 million on hand to operate, Saylor had enough leeway to invest as much as he could in Bitcoin.\n\nSaylor controlled over 70% of MicroStrategy\u2019s voting shares, so he technically had supreme control over the company.\n\nBitcoin Maximalism\n\nIn the short term, Saylor\u2019s investment paid off. MicroStrategy bought over twenty thousand Bitcoins in August 2020 at an average price of around $11,500.\n\nMicroStrategy announced in December 2020 that it had bought a total of 70,000 Bitcoins with an average purchase price of around $16,000. As MicroStrategy bought Bitcoins, so did Michael Saylor.\n\nIn October 2020, Saylor announced that he\u2019d personally purchased 17,732 bitcoin at an average price of $9,882. By October 2021, the Bitcoin Saylor personally held was worth over a billion dollars. When he made the purchase, he\u2019d paid over two hundred million. That reflected an unrealized capital gain of over 500% in a year. Not even the best-performing hedge funds could offer such astonishing returns.\n\nSaylor had gone all in on Bitcoin and reaped extraordinary returns. The share price of MicroStrategy was rising due to its crypto investment, and Saylor\u2019s wealth was ballooning out of control.\n\nIf Saylor was only in it for the money, he might have started selling at the top. His investment had seen a 500% increase, and he\u2019d made as much money as anyone could make in under a year. But Saylor didn\u2019t just see Bitcoin as an investment vehicle. He saw it as the currency of the future, and the price of Bitcoin was a mere addendum. That\u2019s why in 2021, as Bitcoin started to slip and tumble down, he posted a tweet declaring he was a Bitcoin maximalist."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBitcoin continued to trend range bound on Saturday, riling investors who had to contend with lacklustre price volatility in the past 14 months. At press time, the top cryptocurrency was trading at $16,966 after a 1.11% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Its biggest rival, Ethereum, also traded sluggishly at $1263- a level it has been toying at for the past two days.\n\nBTCUSD Chart by TradingView\n\nUnlike the past year, where a clique of high net-worth investors like Tim Draper and Ark Invest CEO Cathie woods made extremely optimistic calls for Bitcoin, it has increasingly become harder for investors to predict where crypto prices may be going as 2023 unravels. However, some sceptics are convinced that Bitcoin will plunge lower before the curve can flatten out in the coming days.\n\nFor instance, Gareth Soloway, the chief market strategist of InTheMoneyStocks, believes there is more room for Bitcoin to the downside. Speaking to Kitco News earlier yesterday, the pundit who correctly predicted Bitcoin\u2019s 2021 top, noted that Bitcoin could plunge to $9,000.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still looking at eventually $12,000 to $13,000 in a short-term target. I do believe it will go lower than that and pierce $10,000 and could go as low as $9,000 before all this is over.\u201d Soloway told Kitco\u2019s, David Lin.\n\nAccording to him, the Bitcoin chart was in the process of forming a \u201cbear flag pattern\u201d which, if validated, could see its price drop to the said level. He, however, stated that BTC was likely to see a minor rally in the near term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll we have to do is take out $17,000, and I actually think we are going to get a short-term rally to about $18,400. So actually, I\u2019m very short-term bullish, but you can\u2019t ignore the bigger pattern here, which is still bearish.\u201d\n\nSoloway\u2019s predictions come even as the FTX debacle hammers the markets. In the past two months, firms linked to Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto empire have been folding, crushing investors\u2019 risk appetite. To Soloway, however, whereas \u201cthere is still some flushing to do\u201d, there was no doubt that all this was getting closer to ending.\n\n\u201cWe are also getting close to potential regulation, which I think will be a huge asset for bitcoin and crypto as that will be an avenue for big money to start dabbling in crypto again,\u201d he went on.\n\nPreviously, Soloway has called for Bitcoin at $500,000 in the long term as clear regulations for the crypto sector are passed, and adoption picks up. Since tapping an all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021, Bitcoin\u2019s price has fallen over 75%, making it the fourth largest wipe-out of all time in the asset\u2019s history."

        "content": "BlackRock makes bitcoin eligible investment to $15B fund\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is adding bitcoin as an eligible investment to its flagship Global Allocation Fund, which is one of the most preferred vehicles for ordinary and passive investors.\n\nA company filing shows that the move enables BlackRock to allocate part of the fund\u2019s $15 billion to cash-settled bitcoin futures traded on commodity exchanges registered with the CFTC.\n\nGlobal Allocation Fund adopts a fully managed investment policy utilizing U.S. and foreign equity, debt and money market securities, the combination of which are varied from time to time in response to economic trends. In normal market conditions, the primary fund invests at least 70% of its total assets in the securities of corporate and governmental issuers. Based on its past performance, it delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 10.35%, and ranks in the top third among its category peers.\n\n\u201cThe Fund may invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures that are traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,\u201d the filing states.\n\nBlackRock made headlines last year when it added bitcoin futures to derivatives products that two of its funds can invest in. The development came shortly after CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, provided a somewhat bullish take on the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency. In a relatively rare endorsement, Fink said Bitcoin has \u2018caught the attention\u2019 and could largely replace gold but warned of its growing popularity that has a real impact on the US dollar.\n\nBack then, Fink, who has grown BlackRock into the world\u2019s largest money-management corporation, dismissed bitcoin as nothing more than a vehicle for speculation and money laundering.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest asset manager launched a blockchain-focused ETF in April that provides investors with exposure to the crypto and blockchain industry. The company added the Blockchain and Tech ETF (IBLC) to its iShares product line.\n\nBlackRock had inked a partnership deal with the prime brokerage arm of US popular exchange, Coinbase. The collaboration is, however, limited to bitcoin and will allow BlackRock\u2019s institutional clients to have access to crypto trading, custody, prime brokerage, and reporting via Coinbase Prime. The clients are also able to manage their bitcoin and conduct risk analysis using BlackRock\u2019s software suite Aladdin.\n\nBlackRock also participated in $400 million funding round for Boston-based fintech startup Circle. In addition to its investment and role as a primary asset manager of USDC cash reserves, BlackRock entered into a partnership with Circle to explore capital market applications for its stablecoin."

        "content": "TOKYO -- The price for graphics cards -- a computer component crucial for data-intensive activities like gaming -- has dropped about 60% from a 2021 peak amid a slowdown in cryptocurrency mining.\n\nAn extensive array of graphics cards lined the shelves at Dospara, a computer parts store in the capital's Akihabara electronics district, in early December. Back in early 2021, those same shelves would have stood empty.\n\nGraphics cards on average sold for 18,737 yen ($144) at online auctions in November, down roughly 60% from May 2021, according to price comparison platform Aucfan. The number of cards sold at auction also fell about 40% over the same period to 5,379.\n\nThe average price for graphics cards came to 66,300 yen in November, according to Tokyo-based research company BCN. While the figure has been creeping up with the launch of new higher-end products, it is still about 20% below the recent high from June 2021.\n\nGraphics cards, which contain graphics processing units (GPUs), are what allow computers to produce detailed, smooth images. They are critical to activities like gaming and video editing.\n\nGraphics cards at Dospara's main branch in Akihabara in December 2022. (Photo by Hiroki Masuda)\n\nTheir ability to process high volumes of calculations at once also make them well-suited for mining cryptocurrency, which involves solving complex puzzles. Surging cryptocurrency prices in 2021 fueled greater demand for GPUs, which ate into the availability of the components for those building custom computers at home.\n\n\"Graphics cards were no longer reaching our intended gaming audience, especially at the beginning of 2021,\" said the Japanese unit of GPU supplier Nvidia.\n\nNvidia responded by producing GPUs with lower hash rates, which makes them less efficient at mining, since launching the GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card in February 2021. It launched products specifically designed for mining at the same time.\n\nBut cryptocurrencies have since plunged. One bitcoin was worth around $17,000 as of late December, according to CoinDesk -- around 80% below the record high from November 2021. Ethereum was also down about 80%.\n\nSoaring energy prices have further weighed on mining operations, which are extremely power intensive.\n\n\"There's little payoff for miners right now, with cryptocurrencies losing value even as the costs of mining them increase,\" said Takeshi Kamada, an executive officer at price comparison website Kakaku.com.\n\nThe concept of mining itself faces growing criticism on environmental grounds. Ethereum -- the main driver behind crypto-related GPU demand, according to Nvidia -- switched to a mechanism that eliminated the need for mining in September. A scaling back of cryptocurrency mining means the industry will have less of an impact on the market for graphics cards.\n\nThose on the sales floor express relief over the shift.\n\n\"I've seen firsthand how incoming shipments have become more stable,\" said Shoki Hisasue, who manages Dospara's Akihabara store. \"We can recommend multiple options to gamers and video creators who come here, which makes our job easier.\"\n\nA representative at another computer parts store said, \"People who genuinely enjoy computer gaming can buy graphics cards now.\"\n\nThe mining boom had hampered growth in the PC games market.\n\nThe global game market will expand by about 10% from 2022 to 2025 to $211.2 billion, according to Dutch research company Newzoo International."

        "title": "Bitcoin's annualized 3-month futures basis show a calm before the storm - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Out of all the crypto derivative products, perpetual futures have emerged as a preferred instrument for market speculation. Bitcoin traders use the instrument en masse for risk hedging and capturing funding rate premiums.\n\nPerpetual futures, or perpetual swaps as they\u2019re sometimes referred to, are futures contracts with no expiration date. Those holding perpetual contracts are able to buy or sell the underlying asset at an unspecified point in the future. The price of the contract remains the same as the underlying asset\u2019s spot rate on the contract\u2019s opening date.\n\nTo keep the contract\u2019s price close to the spot price as time goes by, exchanges implement a mechanism called a crypto funding rate. The funding rate is a small percentage of a position\u2019s value that must be paid or received from a counterparty at regular intervals, usually every few hours.\n\nA positive funding rate shows that the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the spot rate, indicating higher demand. When the demand is high, buy contracts (longs) pay funding fees to the sell contracts (shorts), incentivizing opposing positions and bringing the contract\u2019s price closer to the spot rate.\n\nWhen the funding rate is negative, sell contracts pay the funding fee to the long contracts, again pushing the contract\u2019s price closer to the spot rate.\n\nGiven the size of both the expiring and the perpetual futures market, comparing the two can show the broader market sentiment when it comes to future price movements.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s annualized 3-month futures basis compares the annualized rates of return available in a cash-and-carry trade between 3-month expiring futures and perpetual funding rates.\n\nCryptoSlate analysis of this metric shows that the perpetual futures\u2019 basis is significantly more volatile than that of expiring futures. The discrepancy between the two is a result of increased demand for leverage in the market. Traders seem to be looking for a financial instrument that tracks spot market price indexes more closely, and perpetual futures match their needs perfectly.\n\nPeriods where the perpetual futures\u2019 basis trades lower than the 3-month expiring futures basis have historically occurred after sharp price declines. Large derisking events such as bull market corrections or prolonged bearish slumps are often followed by a decrease in the perpetual future basis.\n\nOn the other hand, having the perpetual futures basis trade higher than the 3-month expiring futures basis show high demand for leverage in the market. This creates an oversupply of sell-side contracts that lead to price slumps, as traders act fast to arbitrage down the high funding rates.\n\nLooking at the chart above shows that both Bitcoin expiring futures and perpetual swaps were trading in a state of backwardation during the FTX collapse.\n\nBackwardation is a state in which the price of a futures contract is lower than the spot price of its underlying asset. It occurs when the demand for an asset gets higher than the demand for contracts maturing in the coming months.\n\nAs such, backwardation is a pretty rare sight in the derivatives market. During the collapse of FTX, expiring futures were trading at an annualized basis of -0.3%, while perpetual swaps were trading on an annualized basis of -2.5%.\n\nThe only similar periods of backwardation were seen in September 2020, the summer of 2021 following the China mining ban, and July 2020. These were periods of extreme volatility and were dominated by shorts. All of these periods of backwardation saw the market hedged towards the downside and preparing for further slumps.\n\nHowever, every period of backwardation was followed by a price rally. Upward price action began in October 2020 and peaked in April 2021. July 2021 was spent in the red and was followed by a rally that continued well into December 2021. The Terra collapse in June 2022 saw a rally in late summer that lasted until the end of September.\n\nThe vertical price drop caused by the FTX collapse brought on backwardation that looks eerily similar to the previously recorded periods. If historical patterns were to repeat, the market could see positive price action in the coming months.\n\nBitcoin Market Data At the time of press 12:01 pm UTC on Jan. 7, 2023, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is up 1.06% over the past 24 hours.

        "content": "Most people don\u2019t think about the Federal Reserve very often, and only a select few contemplate the effects that the U.S. central bank has on investors. But over the past few years, that\u2019s begun to change. Many economists and keen market watchers are making the case that years of loose monetary policies from the Fed and other central banks following the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) helped create an \u201ceverything bubble\u201d\u2014and now it\u2019s popping.\n\nThe everything bubble idea isn\u2019t new. For years before 2022\u2019s stock market woes, leading minds on Wall Street including the investing legend Jeremy Grantham warned about a brewing \u201csuperbubble.\u201d The idea is that near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing (QE)\u2014a policy where the Fed would buy mortgage-backed securities and government bonds to boost lending and investment in the economy\u2014pushed investors toward riskier investments, allowed unsustainable business models to thrive on cheap debt, and helped fuel the Pandemic Housing Boom.\n\nRenowned investment manager Jeremy Grantham believes we\u2019re in a \u201csuperbubble.\u201d Lane Turner\u2014The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s early days, but in retrospect a lot of outlandish financial predictions accompanied this era of easy money. And the fallout for Americans hasn\u2019t been pretty, as inflation continues to rage and recession fears mount. But there is a silver lining for the finance community. The everything bubble provided some of the most ridiculous\u2014and hilarious\u2014forecasts in history.\n\nFrom cryptocurrency experts and hedge fund managers to economists and investment banks, the easy money era was filled with bulls who believed the good times would never end. Here\u2019s a look at some of their strangest calls.\n\nThe Bitcoin bulls\n\nThe cryptocurrency boom of 2020 and 2021 was unprecedented. Between January 2020 and the peak of the crypto fervor in November 2021, the industry\u2019s total value grew to over $3 trillion and Bitcoin prices soared roughly 800%.\n\nThe crypto faithful were sure that the party was just beginning. Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper said in June 2021 that Bitcoin would hit $250,000 by the end of 2022. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to be right on this one,\u201d he assured CNBC\u2019s Jade Scipioni.\n\nBitcoin ended up finishing 2022 just above $16,500, but just last month, Draper repeated his call for Bitcoin to hit $250,000\u2014this time he said it would be by the middle of 2023.\n\n\u201cI expect a flight to quality and decentralized crypto like bitcoin, and for some of the weaker coins to become relics,\u201d Draper told CNBC.\n\nTim Draper did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nDraper wasn\u2019t the only leading figure to jump on the Bitcoin train during the easy money era and make lofty forecasts either. ARK Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood was the first public asset manager to gain exposure to Bitcoin via the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) as a part of her tech-focused exchange-traded ETFs in 2015.\n\nArk Invest CEO Cathie Wood is long on Bitcoin and critical of FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried. Hugo Amaral\u2014SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nThe bet led Wood to face serious criticism from her peers, but barring a brief crypto winter in 2018, it paid off as Bitcoin\u2019s price soared to over $65,000 by November 2021.\n\nWood was sure that the good times would last throughout the bull market. In November 2020, she told Barron\u2019s that institutional adoption of crypto would drive Bitcoin\u2019s price to $500,000 by 2026 and repeatedly \u201cbought the dip\u201d whenever Bitcoin prices fell. Wood even told The Globe and Mail in a February 2020 interview that Bitcoin was \u201cone of the largest positions\u201d in her retirement account.\n\nThe ARK Invest CEO remained bullish even at the start of 2022, when Bitcoin prices had fallen from their highs of over $65,000 to just under $50,000. She argued that the leading cryptocurrency would touch $1 million by 2030 in ARK\u2019s \u201cBig Ideas 2022\u201d annual research report.\n\nSince then Bitcoin\u2019s price has dropped more than 60%, but Wood and her team aren\u2019t fazed, and still believe that their prediction is fair.\n\n\u201cWe think Bitcoin is coming out of this smelling like a rose,\u201d Wood told Bloomberg in December, arguing that institutions will eventually buy into Bitcoin after it is \u201cbattle tested\u201d by the crypto winter.\n\nCathie Wood did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nTom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, who previously served as chief equity strategist at JPMorgan and spent over 25 years on Wall Street, has also been a perennial Bitcoin bull. In early 2022, he predicted that Bitcoin would hit $200,000 in the coming years.\n\nAnd despite the recent fall, which he admitted has been \u201chorrific\u201d for investors, Lee told CNBC in November that he still believes Bitcoin will come out of the current downtrend and hit his target. But while many crypto forecasters are sticking by their lofty estimates, Wall Street has been walking back some of theirs.\n\nTom Lee did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nLofty stock market forecasts\n\nInvestment banks made some pretty dramatic forecasts during the cheap money era. After the stock market soared throughout the pandemic, returning 28% to investors, Wall Street was confident that things would slow down in 2022, but not to the extent that they actually did.\n\nInvestment banks expected the S&P 500 to end 2022 at 4,825, representing only a mild 1% gain for the year. Instead, the blue-chip index dropped roughly 20%.\n\nThe (perhaps unwarranted) bullishness among investment banks was particularly clear when looking at the price targets for growth stocks that benefited from pandemic trends. The online used car retailer Carvana, for example, soared throughout the pandemic as used car prices rose to record highs.\n\nThe firm was able to take advantage of consumers\u2019 inability or unwillingness to shop for vehicles in person during COVID, leading some analysts to give incredibly bullish forecasts.\n\nIn January 2022, Morgan Stanley\u2019s auto analyst Adam Jonas called Carvana the \u201capex predator in auto retail\u201d and assigned a $430 12-month price target to the stock. Since then, shares of the online car retailer have plummeted more than 97% to just $4.48\u2014and some analysts believe more pain lay ahead for investors.\n\nMorgan Stanley has been fined $35 million after devices containing millions of its customers\u2019 data turned up in an online auction. Mario Tama\u2014Getty Images\n\nMorgan Stanley did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nNew Construct\u2019s CEO David Trainer warned investors in June that Carvana was burning cash at an unsustainable rate and may not survive.\n\n\u201cTime is running out for cash-burning companies kept afloat with easy access to capital,\u201d Trainer told Fortune. \u201cThese \u2018zombie\u2019 companies are at risk of going bankrupt.\u201d\n\nCoinbase is another example of the fervor that developed on Wall Street over the past few years. When the cryptocurrency exchange went public in April 2021, shares spiked from their $250 reference price to $381 per share.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer, a former hedge fund manager, took to Twitter after the IPO, saying that he \u201cliked Coinbase to $475.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t alone, investment banks\u2019 average price target for the exchange was over $400 per share in early 2021.\n\nSince then, however, Coinbase stock is down more than 90% amid the crypto winter. And Cramer has changed his mind, saying in a December 13 tweet that he was \u201cnot a buyer of Coinbase here,\u201d calling it \u201ctoo early.\u201d\n\nCNBC did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe cheap money era may have led many forecasters to assume that asset prices would continue to soar, regardless of valuations, but this year has proven to be a wake-up call. Wall Street analysts have slashed their price targets for many of the stock market\u2019s pandemic darlings. It\u2019s a new era for markets and forecasters, as Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer of the investment advisory firm CapWealth, told Fortune last month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be unwinding a lot of the speculation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of revaluation of everything from commercial real estate to how the investing public looks at things like crypto."

        "content": "Since the beginning of the new year, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed some short-term gains, however, the market value of the flagship cryptocurrency continues to languish below important support levels. The BTC price has battled to remain above $17,000 for a number of weeks now, but hasn\u2019t been able to break the resistance and recently fell below the $ 16,900 mark for the first time in almost two months.\n\nBitcoin Still Not Bottomed\n\nThe struggle doesn\u2019t end here as Bitcoin may still be able to reach much lower prices in the future. Data from CryptoQuant, suggests that the price hasn\u2019t bottomed out yet as many were expecting. During positive crypto market cycles, the price usually remains higher than the realized price. On the other hand, as a bear market is nearing its final capitulation phase, the price falls below the realized price, causing widespread panic.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRealized Price is the measure of the average price weighted by the supply of what the entire market participants paid for their coins. It can be interpreted as an on-chain support or resistance price and is calculated as realized cap divided by the total coin supply.\n\nFurthermore, during this period, market players are under a great deal of stress, and as a result, they sell off their assets in order to prevent more losses and control their exposure to further crypto market changes. Now, looking at previous cycles, the beginning of a bull market can be predicted by the BTC price outdoing the realized price. However, this has not yet occurred, as the price has been unable to break above a certain price point and recently got rejected to the downside with significant bearish momentum.\n\nRead More: Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price To Remain Bearish?\n\nAs a result, there is still room for Bitcoin to fall, and the end of the current bear market won\u2019t be expected until the price surpasses the realized price, which is presently at $19.7K. Until then, the negative trend is expected to continue.\n\nAs things stand, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is currently being traded at $16,970. This represents an increase of 0.82% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 2.07% during the week as per CoinGape\u2019s crypto market tracker.\n\nAlso Read: Solana\u2019s BONK Crashes By Nearly 40%; Is The Bull Run Finally Over?"

It moved less than a percent, holding above $16,900 as the job data suggested more rate hikes.\n\nBitcoin Is Poised To Become The World\u2019s \u201cPrimary Monetary Good\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s set aside investors\u2019 woes over the crypto price winter for a moment and consider the reality of Bitcoin in 2023. People used to question whether the cryptocurrency was even here to stay. Now, successful investors and even banking giants have acknowledged its merits.\n\nFidelity Investments not only considers Bitcoin a more secure and resilient cryptocurrency than most of its peers, but its report states the bank\u2019s opinion that BTC has the characteristics and positioning to become the world\u2019s \u201cprimary monetary good.\u201d\n\nNot only is Bitcoin here to stay, but it will underpin more global reserves as the decade goes on. That poses serious concerns and opportunities for U.S. national security and for that of all major world powers in the international hegemony.\n\nNational Security Stake in Joining The Bitcoin Race\n\nWe\u2019re near an important inflection point in Bitcoin\u2019s history. 14 years into the grand experiment, it is now understood by technical professionals and industry investors as a mature technology platform. It has proven its security and reliability, stacking a new block without interruption every ten minutes for 14 years now.\n\nMarkets are starting to reflect this new reality of Bitcoin\u2019s stability and ascendency in world finance. The Bitcoin price is at historically low volatility. While traders who profit from roiling markets may not find it as interesting, institutions and governments are stepping up to bat next.\n\nWhen regulations get clearer, the U.S. will have to rethink its entire foreign policy toolkit. Other sovereign nations are making haste to jump into the Bitcoin race. El Salvador is most notable among them, and others in Central America.\n\nIn its latest National Security Strategy document (NSS), the Biden Administration says:\n\n\u201cWe will explore the merits and responsibly lead development of digital assets, including a digital dollar, with high standards and protections for stability, privacy, and security to benefit a strong and inclusive U.S. financial system and reinforce its global primacy.\u201d\n\nThat will be important over the next decade. The dollar will never go away as a major world reserve. It is too stable, too conventional, and it\u2019s backed by the United States. But many parts of the world actively pursue a de-dollarization policy unheard of in the last century.\n\nThe U.S. can only preserve its global dominance and relevance at 20th-century levels by joining the Bitcoin race for hash power and BTC."

        "title": "The struggle for the true Bitcoin: BTC, BCH or BSV - CoinGeek",
        "content": "In a previous article titled, Who is trying to control, manipulate or destroy Bitcoin?, Marquez Comelab discussed the different groups of people who have different incentives to influence Bitcoin, take it over, control it, or make it their own. Here, he tells the story of how varying factions struggled to control Bitcoin and, in the process, created three implementations of Bitcoin: Core (BTC), Cash (BCH), and Satoshi Vision (BSV), each one claiming to be the true Bitcoin.\n\nCore (BTC): Small blocks vs big blocks\n\nIn 2017, it became increasingly evident that BTC was unfit to deal with the challenges of being a global currency. It could only handle a maximum of seven transactions per second. The network quickly became congested. People had to wait days or weeks for their transactions to be processed.\n\nThis performance limit results from BTC having only a 1 megabyte block size limit coded into the Bitcoin software. People who had a stake in Bitcoin\u2019s future have been aware of this looming problem. Satoshi Nakamoto added this limit to deal with the possibility of spam transactions being sent to the network in its early years. However, he was explicitly clear that the limit should be removed before the network reached capacity. He even provided a guideline on how this could be done. As the network reached full capacity the protocol engineers that maintained the Bitcoin code refused to remove the block size limit. There was a stalemate.\n\nSince around 2015, discussions and views began to diverge: some argued to keep the block size as is, and others claimed to enlarge it. This is called the \u201cScaling Debate\u201d; the two groups were called the Big Blockers and the Small Blockers.\n\nThe Big Blockers argued that Satoshi had already provided a way to solve the issue: to enlarge the block size and enable Bitcoin to process more transactions as people adopted and used it. Prominent Big Blockers include Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, Calvin Ayre and Dr. Craig Wright.\n\nThe Small Blockers were people who argued that the way to deal with the transaction congestion problem was to change Satoshi\u2019s protocol design so it can include other third party scaling solutions. An example of such a third party scaling solution is called the Lightning Network. For Lightning Network to facilitate working with Bitcoin, the Small Blockers wanted to modify the Bitcoin protocol to implement a change called \u201cSegwit.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the Lightning Network was still very much experimental, and Segwit alone was certainly not enough to solve the congestion issue. Big Blockers, like Roger Ver, wondered why it was not considered to simply enlarge the size of the blocks until a better solution was ready. It seemed, however, that the Small Blockers were trying to solve the congestion problem more complex than it needed to be.\n\nMany Big Blockers distrusted the true intentions and incentives of the Small Blockers. One reason was that the Small Blockers censored the discussions about how to best scale Bitcoin, which they argued stifled the right of others to hear all available information and to arrive at a consensus. For example:\n\nSmall Blockers were censoring discussions about the scaling issue on websites like Reddit, where people gather and discuss all things Bitcoin.\n\nWhen Brian Armstrong, chief executive officer of Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), posted his support for bigger blocks in 2016, Small Blockers removed Coinbase as a recommended wallet on the Bitcoin.Org website, a site originally set up by Satoshi Nakamoto to provide information about Bitcoin.\n\nEven more serious consideration is the connection between the most influential Small Blockers, the centralized BTC Core developers, who have the monopoly on the BTC protocol, and a company called Blockstream. In 2014, a few protocol engineers like Pieter Wuille and Gregory Maxwell formed a company called Blockstream, along with Adam Back. Blockstream created proprietary bolt on solutions that catered to the perceived inadequacies of Bitcoin. Their products are only justified if BTC had high transaction fees which small blocks insured. Major incumbent financial organizations like AXA also fund them employing many BTC developers.\n\nMany Big Blockers suspected Bitcoin had been captured by the industry it sought to disrupt. By keeping the block size small, the BTC core developers were intentionally crippling Bitcoin\u2019s ability to process transactions. For what possible reason? So, they could profit by providing their solutions to a problem that they allowed and continued to perpetuate for their own financial gain or for the gain of others. Whether Blockstream was set up for this purpose did not matter. As long as this conflict of interest exists, Small Blockers associated with Blockstream and those invested in Second-Layer solutions are incentivized to keep Bitcoin blocks small. When an incentive exists, it is bound to be exploited.\n\nBTC forks away from Bitcoin protocol\n\nIn 2017, the Small Blockers were scheduled to implement a protocol change called Segwit on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Big Blockers wanted to avoid Segwit. So on August 1, 2017, the Small Blockers \u201cforked\u201d Bitcoin and kept the ticker BTC to represent their new blockchain protocol.\n\nIn the case of Bitcoin, the protocol and the blockchain (the record of all transactions) have been duplicated, but as they march forward in time, the two blockchains will diverge as they begin to record a different set of transactions. The Small Blockers continued to work on the BTC blockchain and implement Segwit, and the origin Bitcoin blockchain started being referred to by Big Blockers as Bitcoin Cash which used the ticker symbol BCH.\n\nAfter the fork, the Big Blockers had a more significant challenge than the Small Blockers. The Small Blockers\u2019 chain kept the original ticker (BTC). As a result, people continued treating it as though it was more Bitcoin than Bitcoin Cash. By default, all the exchanges, apps, and wallets remained connected to BTC as they always have. Bitcoin Cash had to start its application layer practically from scratch.\n\nSetting the Bitcoin protocol in stone\n\nA year after the BTC forked off Bitcoin, another issue began dividing the Big Blockers. BCH developers proposed changes that seemed to focus on changing how the transactions were sorted on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHowever, certain members of the Big Blockers, like Calvin Ayre and Dr. Craig Wright, became increasingly suspicious of the motives behind the proposed changes. They argued that Bitcoin should focus on scaling and follow a more aggressive approach towards enlarging the block size limit and eventually removing it so it can handle the transaction volumes required by the entire planet.\n\nUnlike the BTC-BCH split, when people were divided over how big the block size should be, people in the Big Blocks camp were divided between those who wished to continue making significant changes to the Bitcoin protocol, and those who wanted to restore it to the original version that Satoshi Nakamoto released in 2009. The latter group believed and was confident that the Bitcoin Whitepaper and Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s protocol always had what was needed for Bitcoin to achieve its objective of becoming cash for the world.\n\nBCH forks away from the Bitcoin protocol\n\nNakamoto Consensus. In Bitcoin, this is called a \u201chash war.\u201d The miners headed by Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright were up against miners led by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu. The war cost millions of dollars on both sides. On November 15, 2018, Bitcoin took the new ticker BSV and Roger Ver and Jihan Wu forked off the original Bitcoin creating a brand new protocol but kept the BCH ticker symbol on exchanges.\n\nThe Vision\n\nThe Satoshi Vision implementation of the Bitcoin protocol (BSV) focused on restoring the original scripting language op codes that were removed by BTC developers. The focus was to continue developing Bitcoin as described in the Bitcoin white paper. Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright had grown restless with the tendency of developers to keep tinkering with the Bitcoin protocol. They committed to undo all the changes developers made to the Bitcoin code over the years and have it rewritten to resemble, as close as possible, the original Bitcoin protocol.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol would then be \u201cset in stone,\u201d just as Nakamoto believed it should be. Before Satoshi seemingly vanished, he wrote: \u201cThe nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.\u201d\n\nIn numerous presentations, BSV entrepreneur Jimmy Nguyen, who is a significant voice of those supporting Bitcoin SV, points out that it is not feasible for giant corporations, governments, and other organizations to build on Bitcoin if the protocol keeps changing. He likened the Bitcoin protocol to the Internet protocol. The Internet Protocol may not be perfect and can be improved like everything else. But because it is a fundamental foundation of the Internet on which millions of websites are built, it is most critical for it to be stable. Everyone else can develop on top of it, adjusting for whatever weaknesses it has. Let us stop tinkering with Bitcoin and let us begin professionalizing it.\n\nCraig Wright also emphasizes that for something to become as important as a global currency, it must be decentralized.\n\nDecentralization refers to the concept of control. If developers are allowed to keep changing the Bitcoin protocol, then they have control over it. Keeping the Bitcoin software/protocol permanent and \u201cset-in-stone\u201d denies anyone the opportunity to control Bitcoin. Ensuring this is done is how decentralization of control is achieved in Bitcoin.\n\nIn February 2020, in the \u201cGenesis\u201d upgrade, BSV developers returned the Bitcoin protocol as closely as possible to the original release in 2009 by Bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the distinctions between the three projects identifying themselves as Bitcoin are the following:\n\nBTC adherents are following a path where they hope to sell and profit from second-layer solutions to the world.\n\nBCH adherents are still chasing ambitions of becoming an anonymous superior cash system. However, like BTC, their developers are still making changes to their protocol.\n\nBSV adherents believe that Bitcoin should follow the vision and description set forth by its inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, and have shown their commitment to this belief by restoring the Bitcoin Protocol to the original protocol 2009, and \u2018set it in stone\u2019. Their convictions are proving to be correct.\n\nIn September 2022, more than two years after BCH forked away from Bitcoin, BSV extended the recommended block size limit to four gigabytes. That is 4,000 times bigger than BTC\u2019s block size of 1MB. It has also processed 23 times more transactions per day (6,735,600 transactions) than BTC (290,702) and 267 times more than BCH (25,150).\n\nThe superiority of Bitcoin SV\u2019s ability to process large volumes of transactions is a testament to the guiding principles of Satoshi\u2019s vision for Bitcoin that the BSV supporters have committed to fulfilling.\n\nTo the builders\u2026 To the developers\u2026 To those with a vision of a better future\u2026@BitcoinAssn @nChainGlobal and all of us are going to ensure that you have the platform to transform the world.

        "content": "Blackrock, the world\u2019s largest investment management company, has added bitcoin to its \u201cGlobal Allocation Fund,\u201d an IPO since 1997. Only 0.32% of Blackrock\u2019s funds are said to be able to buy all the bitcoin from global exchanges.\n\nThe BlackRock Global Allocation Fund now provides exposure to Bitcoin for regular and passive investors. The $15 trillion in assets that BlackRock Global Allocation Fund manages should increase with the inclusion of Bitcoin. Bitcoin adoption is growing non-stop. Other cryptos are doing also well on adoption. And the message is clear: spreading your investments across different cryptocurrencies is strategic, and we must learn from the experts.\n\nThe fund has been through many crises. Therefore, this is an important step in crypto that Blackrock saw and decided to invest some money, so keep an eye out. Bear could turn Bull market real quick, once other global asset managers start to follow suit. Compare $BTC mcap to Gold, now think of digital gold \u2018BTC\u2019s potentials.\n\nExcept it\u2019s more cash settled futures. \u201cThe Fund may invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures that are traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\u201d\n\nYes, the point is in the attention of such a giant. If the BTC Stop ETF gets approved, it will send it. Institutions would inject trillions in crypto, this bear market will just be a blip on charts. Not saying it will happen as I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but it is a possibility.\n\nNow imagine when there\u2019s real crypto regulation. Sure, let the SEC call them all securities and let there be panic. When the dust settles, remaining holders will be very happy after the big guys like black rock take a 0.5% position.\n\nSo with BlackRock now announcing a new private Bitcoin [BTC] trust for institutional investors, you know things are getting serious. Because with this new service, some of the firm\u2019s biggest clients will now be able to gain direct exposure to the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin, along with all the major crypto coins, has been smashed in recent months. We are deep in the early stages of a \u2018crypto winter\u2019. These periods of price and investment dormancy are symptomatic of the recurring boom and bust cycle that crypto goes through every few years.\n\nThe key point, though, is that BlackRock is likely betting they\u2019re getting in close to the bottom. Like any experienced investor, they know that the time to start buying is when most people are selling. And their clientele likely knows this too:\n\n\u2018Despite the steep downturn in the digital asset market, we are still seeing substantial interest from some institutional clients in how to efficiently and cost-effectively access these assets using our technology and product capabilities.\u2019\n\nBlackRock is among a group of creditors that lent money to Bitcoin miner Core Scientific so that it can continue to operate while in bankruptcy in December of 2022, BlackRock issued a $17 million loan to bankrupt Bitcoin miners.\n\nFew seem to be talking about how the matrix took over a huge chunk of the hashrate through bankruptcies the last 12 months.\n\nApparently, Cash-settled futures are NOT bitcoin. It\u2019s a derivative that requires NO actual ownership of Bitcoin. It is a fiat mechanism for paper trading real assets.\n\nThis is a synthetic position that has unlimited supply. They need black rock to be a market maker and provide liquidity, one step closer for more Bitcoin mining derivatives institutional adoption.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

(bymandesigns - stock.adobe.com)\n\nFrom multiple hacks, to the war in the Ukraine, to investors simply giving up on the extreme level of electricity and computing power to mine new coins, the market plunged.\n\nFor headline currency Bitcoin, the figures were dire. At the start of 2022 one Bitcoin was worth as much as $AUD 75,000.\n\nToday that very same asset is worth just $AUD 25,000 - a value crash of almost 70 per cent. If the property market had the same decline, there would be riots.\n\nBut after a miserable end to 2022, ending in the collapse of exchange FTX and charges brought against its founder, some believe crypto may rise again.\n\nMany in the cryptocurrency sector welcome more regulation as a sign of the technology gaining legitimacy. (Supplied)\n\nSimon Peters, crypto market analyst at social investing network eToro, says some cryptocurrencies may begin to appear to offer good value to long-term investors.\n\n\"This year was a torrid year for the cryptoasset market. Yet, the 'crypto winter' could give way to a 'crypto spring',\" Peters said.\n\nWhen assessing Bitcoin he believes the market may have already bottomed out.\n\n\"A popular 'on-chain metric' to identify top and bottoms in the bitcoin price is the MVRV-Z score,\" Peters explains.\n\n\"At present, the score indicates the current market value of bitcoin is far below its realised or 'fair' value and at the lowest levels since December 2018, the bottom of the last bitcoin bear market.\n\n\"Reaching this point has historically been a good indicator we are near the bottom of a bitcoin price cycle and it suggests we could be closer to a 'crypto spring'.\ufeff\"\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Why customers who trusted crypto giant may be left with nothing\n\nAt the breakout of the war in Ukraine, many thought Bitcoin would be an ideal 'safe haven' asset as it was not connected to geopolitics. (Getty)\n\nRegulation from financial bodies, while typically a brake on hot markets, may actually prove to be beneficial for cryptocurrency given its past links with those operating outside of legitimate financial markets.\n\n\"Regulation is most certainly top of mind for 2023, and this is to be welcomed by investors, platforms and users of crypto alike,\" Peters says.\n\n\"Ensuring best practices are being followed, such as segregation of customer assets, correct collateralisation and reconciliation, plus transparency, will be really important for both regulators and crypto market participants looking for a more sustainable market in the aftermath of events this year.\n\n\"It will also be key to rebuilding trust.\ufeff\"\n\nBitcoin alone shed almost 70 per cent of its value in 2022 - but many believe we are at the bottom of the market. (Getty)\n\nA key barrier in the way of Bitcoin - and consequently cryptocurrency as a whole - is not legitimacy or regulation, but the environment.\n\nMining Bitcoins requires an astonishingly high amount of electricity. It's\ufeff estimated that the energy required to mine a single Bitcoin at current rates would equal that of the traditional Aussie household's electricity consumption for 15 years.\n\nInvestors are shying away from traditional fossil-fuelled assets, particularly during a cost of living crisis.\n\n\"The hashrate and difficulty continues to climb to all-time highs for bitcoin. Whilst this makes the Bitcoin network more secure, greater computational power is needed by mining operations to stay competitive, which could continue to increase the overall energy consumption of the network,\" Peters says.\n\n\"Energy consumption will therefore continue to be a bone of contention in the crypto sector, with bitcoin enthusiasts quick to explain why it's no bad thing, and Ethereum proponents pointing to the big fall in energy intensity.\n\n\"Despite the backdrop of an ongoing energy crisis around the world, the debate will continue to be as intractable as ever.\ufeff\""

        "title": "Bitcoin\u2019s price prediction for 2023 - Nairametrics",
        "content": "Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency space had a bumpy ride throughout 2022. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency began the year exchanging hands around $46,700 and ended the year 2022 trading at $16,547.50, which represents a 64.57% decline. Consequently, the coin\u2019s market capitalization took a tumble from around $900 billion on January 1, 2022, to end the year at around $320 billion.\n\nThe same was the story with the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization. The cryptocurrency market capitalization started the year 2022 with a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion and ended the year trading at $795 billion.\n\nThis means the cryptocurrency market lost 63.86% in the year 2020 as contractionary monetary policies made investors weary of risky assets like the cryptocurrency space.\n\nReliving 2022 price predictions: While Bitcoin\u2019s drop-in price could be attributed to the extraordinary circumstances that the entire cryptocurrency market has been through this year, it is important to reevaluate the 2022 price predictions made by various market entities.\n\nS2F Model: One of the most popular predictions was that of analyst PlanB\u2019s Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, which predicted that BTC\u2019s price would trade at nearly $110,000 as of December 2022. Unfortunately, the cryptocurrency finished the year trading at almost 85% off target, which raises questions about the validity of the price model.\n\nStock-to-flow models are generally used to price commodities in the traditional markets, as they account for two variables related to an asset: stock and flow. \u201cStock\u201d refers to the total existing supply of the asset, and \u201cflow\u201d refers to the new supply of the asset created each year.\n\nAntoni Trenchev, the Co-founder and Managing Partner of digital asset management platform Nexo, listed some of the factors that could influence Bitcoin to include market demand, regulatory changes and technological developments. He added that though the S2F is an important tool for predicting Bitcoin price, it is based assumptions.\n\nOther models: Besides S2F, other models have been used to attempt to predict the price of Bitcoin in the near and distant future. Two popular ones are Elliott Wave Theory and Hyperwave Theory. While both also find their roots in traditional financial markets, their success in predicting the price of BTC has been relatively limited as well.\n\nWhat you should know: Cryptocurrencies only began their journey as an asset just over a decade ago, and it is safe to say that they are still in the nascent stages of price discovery when compared with commodities like gold or silver and other leading technology stocks like Apple and Microsoft.\n\nThus, while there are various BTC price predictions. It is essential to remember the limited availability of cyclical data to factor into these models. Trenchev added that many different models and approaches can be used to try to predict the price of Bitcoin.\n\nSome people use technical analysis, which involves studying historical price and volume data to identify patterns and trends. Others use fundamental analysis, which involves evaluating the underlying factors that can affect an asset\u2019s demand and supply. No single model or approach is universally considered to be the most reliable for predicting the price of Bitcoin, and it is crucial to consider a range of factors when making any investment decisions.\n\nOne important aspect that could change the trends for the price of Bitcoin is utility. Since Bitcoin is not a smart contract-compatible network, the asset\u2019s utility has been limited to a payment rail. That is slowly beginning to change, with Bitcoin now finding more utility than ever before, supported by the Lightning Network (LN). LN is a layer-2 payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin network that enables fast, seamless peer-to-peer transactions. It helps improve the scalability of the network enormously.\n\nMost recently, Michael Saylor\u2019s MicroStrategy announced that it plans to release Lightning Network-powered software and solutions in 2023. Michael Saylor is a strong Bitcoin advocate and his company is one of the largest corporate entities holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Despite the market decline seen in 2022, MicroStrategy continues adding Bitcoin to its treasury.\n\nBetween November 1st and December 21st, 2022, the company acquired 2,395 BTC at an average price of $17,181 for a total of $42.8 million. For tax reasons, it sold 704 BTC at $16,776 per coin for a total of $11.8 million on December 22nd. As a repurchase, the company bought 810 BTC on Dec. 24 for $13.6 million in cash. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries, this puts the firm\u2019s holdings at 132,500 BTC, worth around $2.2 billion.\n\nBitcoin price expections for 2023: Here is a look at some price predictions for Bitcoin in 2023.\n\nSimon Schaber, the Chief Business Development Officer of Spool, explained:\n\n\u201cOver the course of 2023, the price of Bitcoin should return to a reasonable 25000-30000 U.S. Dollar range, due to a combination of factors. Firstly, as central banks continue to tighten rates, investors will be looking for alternative investments with higher returns, and Bitcoin has been the best-performing asset of the past decade. Secondly, technology stocks have been underperforming recently, and investors may be looking for other options to diversify their portfolios into risk-on asset classes. These two factors combined will contribute to a reasonable but slow increase in the price of Bitcoin over the next year as we are fighting our way out of this recession.\u201d\n\nJames Wo, the Founder and CEO of Digital Finance Group explained:\n\n\u201cExternal reasons like inflation showing moderation, interest rate slowing, energy crisis getting better, and receding recession fear for the US all leave the door open to BTC price. Moreover, a halving of bitcoin production will occur in 2024. 2023 could see the BTC price rising to $30,000.\u201d\n\nImportant Note: Investors should not view this article as investment advice and should do their research and consult the services of a professional financial advisor."

        "title": "BREAKING: Blackrock adds Bitcoin to their $15TR Global Allocation Fund, trillions of $ to flow the market - Crypto News Flash",
        "content": "The American investment firm, BlackRock has added Bitcoin to its $15 trillion Global Allocation Fund.\n\nWith this move, BlackRock can scoop up all BTC on exchanges with just 0.32% of the assets it has under management.\n\nAmerican multinational investment management company, BlackRock has allegedly added Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s largest digital currency by market capitalization to its Global Allocation Fund. As the world\u2019s biggest investment firm with over $10 trillion in assets under management (AUM) as of January 2022, the Bitcoin addition to the firm\u2019s primary fund is considered a very bullish move for the crypto industry.\n\nBlackRock starts to add $BTC to their own Global Allocation Fund for passive investors \ud83d\udc40 Its estimated that only 0.32% of their investment fund is enough to buy all #Bitcoin kept on exchanges Still want to short? \ud83d\udc47 1/5 \u2014 The Wolf of Alt Street (@altc01n) January 5, 2023\n\nBitcoin has thrived over the years as the pioneering cryptocurrency and since its inception about 14 years ago, it has notably gained the interest of institutional investors today. While the charge by Wall Street into Bitcoin can be attributed to MicroStrategy Incorporated, a business intelligence and software firm with over 132,500 Bitcoin units, BlackRock has also made some significant moves to solidify its growing interests in the nascent asset class and sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs reported by CNF, the New York-based firm partnered with publicly traded exchange Coinbase Global Inc back in August last year to offer institutional investors a direct avenue to invest in Bitcoin. The company has made some follow-up moves and launched a spot Bitcoin private trust for its high-profile clients shortly after the Coinbase deal.\n\nThe addition of Bitcoin to its Global Allocation Fund is considered a bigger game changer as it implies the firm could invest directly into the premier cryptocurrency. Considering its last reported asset base, BlackRock will need just about 0.32 percent of the funds in its custody to scoop up all the Bitcoin available on exchanges.\n\nAccording to speculations by the crypto analyst, the Wolf of Alts $treet, the total Bitcoin on all centralized exchanges (CEXs) is currently pegged at about 1,856,625.8. This figure is valued at around $31.1 billion when computed with the current price of BTC around $16,000. In his analysis, $32 billion is just around 0.32 percent of the $10 trillion in custody by BlackRock.\n\nA Bullish Reality\n\nFor the past year, Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem have been waiting for a significant fundamental push that may signal an end to the current crypto winter. The push made by BlackRock to add Bitcoin to its Global Allocation Fund is perhaps one of the most prominent bullish realities the industry is starting the year out with.\n\nWhile BlackRock is definitely going to be conservative with its allocations to Bitcoin, its investments in the coin are largely going to be very significant, and thus, likely impact the coin\u2019s price growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the course of the next few months, we are likely to see trillions of dollars flow into the market as other big investment management companies may also choose to follow in the footsteps of BlackRock to go more bullish on Bitcoin. These events can fuel a run in the price of BTC and a visible rub-off may be seen for altcoins as well.\n\nThis article is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

        "title": "Planning to trade Bitcoin next week? Be ready for this - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has kicked off 2023 on a positive note sustaining short-term gains, although the flagship cryptocurrency continues to trade below crucial support levels. Notably, Bitcoin gains in the first week of 2023 can be attributed to the positive macroeconomic data around the United States employment news.\n\nMoving into the second week of 2023, it is worth noting that Bitcoin\u2019s price action is likely to be dictated by more macroeconomic news, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and inflation data for December expected to come out.\n\nIn this line, crypto trading expert and analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has stated that Bitcoin\u2019s odds of breaking out have increased while explaining what traders planning to trade in BTC the following week should be aware of, he said in a YouTube video posted on January 7.\n\nHowever, according to Poppe, despite the impressive breakout odds, Bitcoin is likely to test sideways trading for a while, noting that the $17,000 target remains possible. Overall, he said Bitcoin is expected to continue rallying.\n\n\u201cWe got a clear resistance at $16,950, and we got a support area here around $16,760. So it seems apparent that we\u2019re going to stay sideways for a little bit before we can start breaking out because the odds of breaking out have increased given the fact that we are testing the resistance multiple times already,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, with CPI data expected to be positive, the analyst states that Bitcoin will likely continue on a big run to target $17,800 while noting the push can be boosted by increased buying pressure. Notably, the data will influence the Federal Reserve\u2019s next monetary policy, with Poppe warning that a weaker economy will likely result in more interest rate hikes.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was trading at $16,949, having recorded daily gains of about 0.1%. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin is up over 2.5%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIndeed, the minor weekly gains helped Bitcoin move away from the sideways trading pattern that characterized the asset towards the end of 2022. In this line, Bitcoin has been attempting to break the $17,000 resistance, focusing on hitting the $18,000.\n\nThe ongoing rally emerged after the U.S. unemployment rate hit 3.5% in December from the 3.7% witnessed in November 2022. Furthermore, the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in December, higher than the estimated 200,000.\n\nElsewhere, the Bitcoin technical analysis on TradingView is mixed. A summary of the one-day gauges recommends the \u2018neutral\u2019 sentiment at 7 while moving averages are for \u2018buy\u2019 at 8. Oscillators are for the \u2018sell\u2019 sentiment at 4.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nWhat next for Bitcoin?\n\nIn the meantime, as Bitcoin attempts to sustain the recent rally, it\u2019s worth noting that the machine learning algorithm at PricePredictions indicates that BTC might end the first month of 2023 on a bearish note. According to the 30-day forecast, Bitcoin might trade at $15,532 on January 31, 2023.\n\nOverall, investors will be hoping Bitcoin has found a bottom to rally again from the lows of 2022. Interestingly, despite the bearish market, Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain managed to record transactions of over $8 trillion in 2022.\n\nFurthermore, there are prevailing fears that the fallout from incidents such as the FTX collapse could impact the market further.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
