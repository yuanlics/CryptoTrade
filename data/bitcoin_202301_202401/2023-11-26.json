        "title": "Bitcoin could support renewable energy development | Cornell Chronicle - Cornell Chronicle",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining is often perceived as environmentally damaging because it uses huge amounts of electricity to power its intensive computing needs, but what if the mining process could be used to mitigate climate change instead of accelerating it?\n\nA new study led by Cornell researchers investigated planned renewable energy projects across the U.S. and calculated each project\u2019s potential to profit from bitcoin mining during the precommercial development phase, when a wind or solar farm is generating electricity, but has not yet been integrated into the grid. The findings suggest some developers could be recouping millions of dollars, which could be invested in future renewable energy projects.\n\nThe study, \u201cFrom Mining to Mitigation: How Bitcoin Can Support Renewable Energy Development and Climate Action,\u201d was published Oct. 27 in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering and is authored by doctoral student Apoorv Lal and Fengqi You, the Roxanne E. and Michael J. Zak Professor in Energy Systems Engineering. Jesse Zhu, distinguished professor from the Western University of Canada, also contributed to the research.\n\nThe analysis showed that Texas is the state with the highest potential, with 32 planned renewable projects that could generate combined profits of $47 million using bitcoin mining during precommercial operations. The researchers determined that the Aktina Solar and Roseland Solar Projects in Texas \u2013 each with 250 megawatt capacities \u2013 were found to be the most profitable, generating a maximum profit of $3.23 million. The Western Trail Wind project, with a capacity of 367 megawatts, showed profitability of $2.65 million.\n\nProjects in California produced the second highest amount of profits in the study, while Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and Virginia had fewer installations but still show profitability.\n\n\u201cProfitability of a mining system hinges on periods of steady energy availability since renewable energy sources can vary significantly,\u201d said You, a senior faculty fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability. \u201cTherefore, it is important to site the mining farm strategically to maximize productivity.\u201d\n\nAs an example, You pointed to California, Colorado, Nevada and Virginia as states where solar installations were the only type of renewable energy project that proved profitable in generating bitcoin during the precommercial phase.\n\nThe researchers suggest several policy recommendations that could help improve the economic feasibility of renewable energy projects and reduce carbon emissions. One is to provide economic rewards for environmentally responsible cryptocurrency mining, such as carbon credits for avoided emissions.\n\n\u201cThese rewards can act as an incentive for miners to adopt clean energy sources, which can lead to combined positive effects on climate change mitigation, improved renewable power capacity and additional profits during precommercial operation of wind or solar farms,\u201d Lal said. \u201cWe also recommend policies that encourage cryptocurrency-mining operations to return some of their profits back into infrastructure development. This would help create a self-sustaining cycle for renewable energy expansion.\u201d\n\nWhile other aspects of cryptocurrency mining still have environmental costs, such as metal depletion and hardware that becomes obsolete within a few years, the researchers said the results indicate that there are ways to mitigate some of the environmental costs of cryptocurrency mining and foster investments in renewable energy.\n\nThe research was partially funded by the National Science Foundation.\n\nDiane Tessaglia-Hymes is a communications specialist for Cornell Engineering."

        "title": "Polluting Bitcoin Mines Come to Rural Georgia - greenpeace.org",
        "content": "Polluting Bitcoin Mines Come to Rural Georgia\n\nBy Erik Kojola and Veronica Kuzuhara\n\nIntroduction\n\nCleanSpark is one of the many Bitcoin mining companies expanding operations in Georgia and across the American South, attracted by lax regulations, tax subsidies, and low energy costs. Beyond the large carbon emissions, growth of the industry means residents of often-rural towns and small cities are confronting the disruptive and polluting impacts of Bitcoin mines in their backyards. Sandersville, Georgia is one of those rural communities where CleanSpark is developing what will be the company\u2019s largest facility.\n\nGrowth of Bitcoin mining in places like Sandersville is supported by investments from big Wall Street firms. Financial giants BlackRock and Vanguard are CleanSpark\u2019s largest shareholders and have provided the company with capital used to maintain and expand its facilities across Georgia. Yet, financial companies haven\u2019t acknowledged how their investments in Bitcoin mining companies are fueling the carbon-intensive and polluting facilities that are popping up in rural areas across the country.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Bitcoin Boom\n\nGeorgia is becoming a popular location for Bitcoin mines. Data from The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance found that Georgia was the most productive Bitcoin mining state in 2021, housing around 31% of all U.S. Bitcoin production. That\u2019s a significant amount since the U.S. hosts more Bitcoin mining than any other country. Miners are coming to Georgia in part for the low cost of electricity where the average energy price of 10.3 cents/kWh is lower than the U.S. average of 12.09 cents. CleanSpark is one of the companies driving the growth of Bitcoin mining in Georgia and operates facilities all across the state including in Norcross, Washington, College Park, two newly-acquired facilities in Dalton, and the company\u2019s largest in Sandersville.\n\nSandersville is a small city in central Georgia with a population of under 6,000 residents that used to be called the \u201cKaolin Capital of the World\u201d due to its extensive production of kaolin, a clay used in making porcelain. The town recently shifted to a new \u201cmining\u201d industry: Bitcoin. Mawson Infrastructure built the town\u2019s first Bitcoin mine in 2021. The site grew from an acre of shipping containers filled with specialized Bitcoin mining computers called ASICS to 41 containers\u201412 of which use as much electricity as the entire town of Sandersville. In October 2022, CleanSpark bought the site and equipment from Mawson, marking the company\u2019s fourth location in Georgia. CleanSpark now operates the facility with thousands of ASICS that use as much electricity as the nearest 49,000 households racing to solve algorithms in order to win newly minted Bitcoin and fees in return for validating Bitcoin transactions. The site is operating at a reported capacity of 80 MW with plans to expand to 230 MW by the end of 2023, dwarfing the 25 MW a day used by the city of Sandersville. In a September press release, CleanSpark said construction is underway for the 150 MW expansion and expected to be completed by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the Municipal Energy Authority of Georgia (MEAG) is building a 200MW substation and related infrastructure which will be used to power the additional capacity at the Sandersville site and expects the substation to be completed in 2023 and the power-line connections in early 2024.\n\nBitcoin Backed by Wall Street Giants\n\nBuying facilities, equipment, and land all requires capital which CleanSpark has gotten in part from the financial services industry. CleanSpark is a publicly-traded company which means the company can raise capital through issuing stock to the public and large investors. CleanSpark became publicly listed in 2020 and in the last few years has used additional equity offerings \u2013 putting up more company stock for sale \u2013 to raise capital for funding expansion. CleanSpark bought the Sandersville facility in September 2022 for $33 million, an acquisition that came after raising $211.86 million through two equity offerings in 2021 and another $40 million deal in 2020. Issuing new shares requires help from an investment bank who provides underwriting \u2013 verifying the company\u2019s finances, setting the sales price, and facilitating the deal. All of CleanSpark\u2019s recent offerings were led by HC Wainwright, an investment bank based in New York, who has provided underwriting for many Bitcoin mining companies.\n\nBig financial companies and institutional investors bought up many of CleanSpark\u2019s shares. Currently, CleanSpark\u2019s top two shareholders are BlackRock, with 4.45% of shares, and Vanguard, with 4.05% of shares \u2013 their combined holdings were valued at $67.91 million. [1] Both companies also increased their shareholdings as of the latest financial filings in August, 2023, BlackRock by 33% and Vanguard by 45%. [2] Other shareholders include big banks and asset managers like JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Fidelity.\n\nCleanSpark\u2019s Bitcoin Greenwashing of Climate Pollution\n\nCleanSpark claims to take a more sustainable approach to Bitcoin mining and to support renewable energy generation despite evidence that the company\u2019s facilities rely largely on fossil fuels. A press release issued at the time of purchasing the Sandersville site states, \u201cCleanSpark draws power predominantly from low-carbon sources, such as nuclear energy, and boasts a clean energy profile that is over 90% non-carbon.\u201d CleanSpark published its Energy Mix and Consumption Data in its 2022 ESG report and claims that from October 2021 to September 2022, the company\u2019s energy mix across four locations was 94.02% \u201cclean energy,\u201d 5.70% \u201ccarbon-based,\u201d and 0.28% \u201cundisclosed.\u201d [3]\n\nYet, other data and independent analysis contradict CleanSpark\u2019s \u201csustainability\u201d claims. Apart from the lack of specificity in what constitutes \u201cclean energy\u201d and vague sourcing of these figures as simply \u201cdata from the power providers,\u201d there is a huge discrepancy between these numbers and Georgia Power\u2019s energy mix, the electric utility that serves Sandersville and much of the state. Georgia Power, which generates most of the power it sells, had an energy mix in 2021 that was 47% gas and oil, 16% coal, 24% nuclear, and 8% renewables. Thus, the majority of its sources are fossil fuels. While the supply of renewables and fossil fuels vary in different parts of the state, that doesn\u2019t account for the wide discrepancy with CleanSpark\u2019s statements.\n\nA joint investigation by the New York Times and tech non-profit WattTime further challenges CleanSpark\u2019s claims about using clean energy. The investigation found that the Sandersville site used a daily average of 72 MW of electricity of which 91% came from fossil fuels, leading to 314,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year. The analysis also estimated that CleanSpark\u2019s College Park, Georgia mine got 91% of the facilities\u2019 power from fossil fuels\u2014emitting 166,000 tons of CO2. These numbers are a far cry from CleanSpark\u2019s \u201c90% non-carbon\u201d promise.\n\nCleanSpark may claim to operate on \u201cclean energy\u201d based on purchasing renewable energy credits (RECs). The company acknowledged participating in the Georgia Simple Solar program that lets customers buy RECs to compensate for fossil fuel usage and carbon emissions. RECs represent one MWh of electricity from a renewable source that can be bought and sold, and lets an energy user claim credit for renewable energy produced elsewhere. However, researchers have found that companies buying RECs does little to spur renewable energy development and offset emissions. Experts argue that RECs are helping companies inflate their sustainability claims while doing little to drive energy transitions and address the climate crisis. RECs allow companies to claim they are meeting renewable energy targets while continuing to rely on dirty fossil fuel energy. Purchasing RECs is different from directly investing in renewable energy infrastructure, such as by owning solar panels or wind turbines, or signing Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) directly tied to renewable energy generation.\n\nBitcoin Noise Pollution in Georgia\n\nIn addition to the carbon emissions contributing to the climate crisis, Bitcoin mines are also very loud, often disturbing nearby residents. Due to the massive computing power used during the mining process, the computers generate substantial amounts of heat and must therefore be cooled to avoid damaging the equipment. Cooling systems often involve industrial-grade fans and air conditioning units that\u2014when combined with the constant operation of mining rigs\u2014result in persistent noise. The relentless hum of these machines can extend far beyond the confines of the mining facilities, unfortunately impacting surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nCommunities across the South have experienced this unexpected noisy intrusion into their daily lives, as residents from Arkansas to Tennessee report disruptions right outside their homes. For example, residents of Adel, Georgia have been plagued by nonstop noise from Bitcoin mines. The incessant drone of fans and machinery, often louder than the recommended cap of 70 decibels, goes beyond mere inconvenience: prolonged exposure to loud noise can have negative effects on people\u2019s mental and physical well-being, interfering with sleep schedules, increasing stress levels, and contributing to long-term health issues like cardiovascular disease.\n\nMany of CleanSpark\u2019s facilities in Georgia operate with the same loud air-cooling processes. Thus, the Sandersville mine may bring disruptive noise to nearby residents, and students and faculty at the Oconee Fall Line Technical College, a local community college, that is less than half a mile away. CleanSpark\u2019s Norcross mining site utilizes an immersion cooling system that cools computers through submersion in synthetic oil \u2013 a process that reduces the amount of energy used and decreases noise pollution by not relying on fans. Though a quieter and more efficient method, it has so far been limited to the smaller 20 MW site in Norcross.\n\nAs CleanSpark announces a planned expansion of the Sandersville site\u2014a $145 million deal to double the fleet\u2019s mining capacity for a \u201cmassive 150 MW expansion\u201d\u2014there could be more noise and disruption in store for residents.\n\nBitcoin Community Impacts and Unmet Promises\n\nCleanSpark promises to help Sandersville through increased tax revenue and job creation, promises that are appealing in rural communities like Sandersville that relied on a single industry that\u2019s gone bust. Sandersville is unique in having its own electrical grid and has agreed to sell electricity to CleanSpark which generates revenue for the city from the sales and taxes. Some elected city officials have been supportive of the mine and the potential for public revenue. But, the long term impacts remain unknown and there is little data on how the facility impacts local jobs, energy prices, and quality of life.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin mining is not a perfect solution and for many towns and cities hasn\u2019t ushered in an era of renewed prosperity. Mining facilities typically have relatively few long term employees, often hiring only a dozen workers per facility, and may be less labor intensive than other industries and energy-intensive facilities. [4] A National Bureau of Economic Research working paper finds that Bitcoin mining can lead to higher energy prices for nearby residents and small businesses which can outweigh increased tax revenue. In 2022, CleanSpark had only around 80 workers spread across all its facilities. Bitcoin mining is a boom and bust industry tied to the volatile price of Bitcoin \u2013 there was a wave of bankruptcies when Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped in 2021. Miners can also easily relocate their facilities, leaving communities high and dry, and move to wherever they can find the cheapest energy.\n\nThe biggest beneficiaries of Bitcoin mines end up being the companies\u2019 executives , owners and investors who don\u2019t live in the community. Instead of broad economic development and prosperity, many towns with Bitcoin mines have been left with noisy and water-intensive facilities and little public input or oversight about the operations. In Kentucky, officials rejected a Bitcoin mining company\u2019s request for energy price discounts because it would contribute to higher prices for regular ratepayers and strain the grid\u2019s energy supply.\n\nOther communities in Georgia and across the U.S. have become wary and are working to prevent expansion of the Bitcoin mining industry. The city of Forsyth, Georgia blocked a Bitcoin mine, partially due to the potential noise, by denying the company\u2019s requested zoning change. Meanwhile in North Carolina, the Clay County Commission board passed an ordinance blocking commercial crypto mining in the county.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 Data collected from Bloomberg Terminal and based on holdings and share prices as of August 31, 2023.\n\n2 Data collected from Bloomberg Terminal.\n\n3 This data does not include the Sandersville site, which was purchased after the evaluation period.\n\n4 See National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, \u201cWhen Cryptomining Comes to Town: High Electricity-use Spillovers to the Local Economy,\u201d for analysis of the local economic impacts of crypto mining including on electricity prices and the labor market. However, there is a lack of data and reporting about job creation from crypto mining which makes it difficult to reliably assess the economic development impacts."

        "content": "CNBC Host Jim Cramer Is Now Bullish on Bitcoin: \u201cIf you like Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin\u201d\n\nJim Cramer, the host of CNBC's Mad Money, has reversed his opinion on Bitcoin and is now urging investors to reconsider their positions as the cryptocurrency reaches its highest value in a year and a half. Previously, Cramer had advised against investing in Bitcoin but now acknowledges that his earlier assessment was premature.\n\nBitcoin has seen a significant surge in value, surpassing $38,000 for the first time in 18 months. Over the past month, the cryptocurrency has shown a steady increase of 10%, while Ethereum has also experienced a spike of 17%, reaching its own 18-month peak.\n\nThis positive momentum is largely attributed to industry optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If approved, the ETF would allow traditional financial institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Analysts believe that such approval could result in a substantial $1 trillion boost for Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\nDespite previously dismissing cryptocurrencies due to the crypto market collapse in May 2022 and the closure of crypto exchange FTX, Cramer now claims that he has always supported those who have long-term faith in Bitcoin. He encourages individuals to consider purchasing Bitcoin if they believe in its potential.\n\nCramer's changing stance on investments has faced criticism from the crypto and finance communities, with some suggesting that going against his advice could be a prudent financial strategy. An inverse Cramer ETF was launched to provide returns opposite of his stock picks.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin may be primed for a $120,000 valuation by the end of 2024, as miners reduce sales of the top cryptocurrency, according to Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick.\n\nIn April, he predicted bitcoin could reach $100,000 by next year, but now thinks that could be too conservative when accounting for miner profitability.\n\n\"We reiterate our end-2024 BTC price target of around $100,000, with potential upside from reduced miner selling,\" he wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nIn a follow-up email to Insider, Kendrick said a price of $120,000 is valid, representing nearly 300% upside from current levels. He also expects bitcoin to jump 67% this year to $50,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis more bullish stance is due to increased mining profitability, which means miners can sell fewer tokens to maintain the same amount of cash flow. That reduces bitcoin supply and pushes prices higher, he said.\n\nKendrick estimated that just under 100% of all bitcoin mined was sold in the second quarter, but he expects miners will start to sell fewer over time. Historically, this occurs when bitcoin's price exceeds the average all-in cash cost of mining, as is happening\n\n\"If the BTC price averages $50,000 by Q1-2024, as we predict, the 'BTC minus all cash costs' calculation would rise to $30,000,\" he wrote. \"On that basis, selling just 27% of BTC mined in Q1-2024 would generate the same absolute level of excess cash as selling 100% in Q2-2023.\"\n\nEffectively, this would be enough to reduce the net supply of bitcoin by around 250,000. Not only could this pressure prices, but would have an effect on the currency's inflation rate, moving it down from 1.7% to 0.4% year-to-year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent weeks, bitcoin has returned above $30,000, after a few Wall Street giants showed interest in creating their own bitcoin ETFs. This has manifested other bullish calls for the crypto token, with Fundstrat's Tom Lee recently predicting a $200,000 valuation over the coming years.\n\nMining profitability has been climbing as the cost to produce new bitcoin falls. That's as large-scale miners, such as Riot and Core Scientific, have clamped down on corporate costs, while energy prices have also declined.\n\nMeanwhile, halving events \u2014 in which the amount of bitcoin produced by mining is halved, with the next one coming in April or May of 2024 \u2014 tend to cause industry consolidation, which further reduces mining expenditures.\n\nThis story was originally published in July 2023."

For three days last week, the 7-day moving average of total transactions fees on the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks flipped in favor of BTC -2.66% for the first time since November 2020.\n\nLong-term holders are accumulating\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nBitfinex analysts said approximately 70% of the total circulating supply of bitcoin has not moved in the past year. This marks a new all-time high, according to the report.\n\n\"This is providing a source of upward pressure as increasing demand chases limited supply,\" the analysts added.\n\nIn a note sent to The Block, Bitfinex analysts saw contrasting behavior between the current dynamics of long-term holders and those observed in past cycles.\n\n\"In the current cycle, there have been fewer dips and oscillations in long-term holder supply due to spending, indicating a trend of continuously increasing supply. This suggests a degree of supply tightness in the bitcoin market regardless of long-term holder profitability on a pretty decent scale,\" the analysts said.\n\nThe Bitfinex analysts concluded their report by saying present conditions support the thesis that the market is in the early stages of a bull market.\n\n\"Bitcoin continues to show strength while still in a range for the time being,\" the Bitfinex analysts added. It was trading at $37,093 at 12:40 p.m. ET, according to The Block data."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Action Indicates More Upside Could Soon Arrive - ETF Trends",
        "content": "With equity markets open just a half day, the day after Thanksgiving is usually a noneventful day in financial markets. However, something notable did occur last Friday: Bitcoin jumped to its highest prices in 18 months.\n\nBitcoin surged above $38,000 on November 24 for the first time since May 2022. In what could be a catalyst for exchange traded funds such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) , bitcoin\u2019s albeit brief history indicates that when the cryptocurrency moves to $38,000, momentum will carry it beyond $40,000.\n\nSATO\u2019s largest holding is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The rest of the ETF\u2019s portfolio is a slew of crypto-correlated equities. In other words, momentum for the largest digital currency can and often does matriculate down to assets such as SATO.\n\nOther Indicators of More Potential Gains for SATO\n\nSome investors want to assess the possibility of more near-term upside for bitcoin and SATO. The futures market might offer some clues.\n\n\u201cAs for derivatives markets linked to Bitcoin, we may witness more momentum tomorrow and in the coming days. According to data provided by Deribit, tomorrow will be the execution date for what are equivalent of more than $4 billion worth of options contracts for Bitcoin, which they are more than 107 thousand contracts, which represent part of more than 14 billion options outstanding,\u201d noted Samer Hasn, an analyst at XS.com. \u201cThis coincides with a further record rise in the value of open interests for Bitcoin futures contracts, which reached approximately $15.93 billion, which represents a new highest level not seen since April of last year.\u201d\n\nAnother point in favor of SATO is that even with this year\u2019s rally by bitcoin, one that\u2019s recently intensified amid speculation that U.S. regulators will soon approve a spot bitcoin ETF, is that many cryptomarket participants aren\u2019t selling into this rally. Rather, they\u2019re standing pat or adding to exisiing positions, expressing devotion to the digital asset.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s very encouraging for Bitcoin right now is 70% of on-chain supply has remain dormant for a year, a new record which tells us long-term Bitcoin holders are steadfast in their determination. It seems little will shake their resolve until prices are much higher,\u201d said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner at crypto lender Nexo, in an interview with Barron\u2019s. \u201cBitcoin is on track for its third consecutive monthly gain. The last time it rose September through November in 2015 and 2016 it went on to log another positive month in December.\u201d"

        "content": "Crypto investors are awaiting Security & Exchange Commission (SEC) approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, which could unlock a surge of capital investment in the crypto space. However, this isn't the first time that crypto news created a stir of hype around digital assets, but is this time truly different?\n\nMarkus Thielen, DeFiResearch.com Head of Research, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss what this ETF approval could mean for bitcoin and the crypto space, and why he feels that if approved, it could potentially reach a high price target.\n\n\"I think, to put it in numbers, there's around $120 billion US dollars in precious metals ETFs in the US, so that means in gold and in silver, and if you just move 10-20% of those and shift them over into bitcoin you have certainly sort of something in the range of like $25 billion of inflow,\" Thielen says. \"And we calculated this might have an impact of every $1 billion dollars of 4% impact on the price , so we might actually see kind of a price towards $57,000.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Now, Marcus, this isn't the first time that we've been waiting for this, you know, a big catalyst for bitcoin. And as you talk about the spot bitcoin ETF, other countries that have launched it didn't see a massive rally. Why will this time be different?\n\nMARKUS THIELEN: Well, the US is, of course, the largest pool of capital. And of course, ETFs are only really established in the US. You know, we have seen this a long time, you know, in Asia, how Asia tried to establish ETFs. But people don't really use them, and I think this is because the investor base is very different for the US market than anywhere else.\n\nAnd the US is really dominated by a lot of institutions. And those institutions are using ETFs really in their asset allocation. Of course, we have the registered investment advisor community, and estimates vary from-- you know, they managed 5 trillion to even more. But if they move like one of those-- 1% of those 5 trillion, that's like 50 billion into bitcoin, right?\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd I think that could have like a big impact because we sort of can calculate if the market cap changes, you know, what might be the implications for the price of bitcoin. And what has really changed is really that we have, you know, certain judges telling around the-- telling the SEC around the grayscale lawsuit to go back and reevaluate their estimates.\n\nWe're having BlackRock as, you know, the largest asset manager in the world also filing for a bitcoin ETF. So I think the pressure is really building. And then there is an overall sentiment that the market had that the US regulatory regime is trying to clean up the market. So-- and the last missing piece in this puzzle was for example to sort of like eliminate an exchange from the US market that has been known and admitted to had, you know, illicit trading going on.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Marcus, you said even if one of these bitcoin ETFs move that could have a big impact. We're looking at bitcoin roughly at $37,000 right now. What does that move look like? How much higher can it go?\n\nMARKUS THIELEN: Yeah. I think, you know, we have we have heard a false rumor that proved not true where bitcoin rallied 10%, you know, literally in a heartbeat. So we would estimate if a if a spot bitcoin ETF would be approved. Bitcoin could go up easily 20%. And I think you know to put it in numbers, there's around $120 billion USD in precious metals ETFs in the US. So that means in gold and in silver.\n\nAnd if you just move you know 10, 20% of those, shift them over into bitcoin, you know, you have certainly sort of something in the range of like $25 billion of inflow. And we calculated this might have actually an impact of every $1 billion, a 4% impact on the price. So we might actually see kind of a price towards kind of 57,000 we calculated we can see if there an approval for the bitcoin ETF.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: 57,000 in the medium term?\n\nMARKUS THIELEN: In the medium term, yes. I mean, it sounds reasonable, right, when you look at-- you know, we were just at 25,000 like two months ago, and now we're at 37,000. So this is just literally like you know sort of like 12,000 rally that we had, so another 12,000 point rally. You know, it gets us already like two to the 50,000 point area.\n\nSo I think this can easily happen. And again, as I said, if you if you put in kind of the macro tailwinds of the fed pausing, if you compare to the 2017 episode when the CME announced the bitcoin future, I mean, I think there is just a lot of tailwind, and I think there's a lot of pent up demand. And you know, don't forget we have all these ETF providers. They are, of course, doing a lot of marketing. There are a lot of educational.\n\nAnd, you know, Larry Fink as the CEO from blackrock is almost you know every other day on TV and saying how important the bitcoin ETF is. So I think there is a coordinated marketing effort now to really bring prices higher."

Boasting a market capitalization of $7.33 billion, MicroStrategy's profitable approach of holding Bitcoin for the long term has yielded favorable results. Under the guidance of its founder and chairman, Michael Saylor, the company initiated the accumulation of the cryptocurrency as a safeguard against inflation starting in August 2020.\n\nMicroStrategy experienced a doubling of its stock price within a month earlier this year, with its Bitcoin investments consistently appreciating. Currently, the company's Bitcoin holdings have turned profitable, with an average purchase price of $29,803 per coin after acquiring an additional 1,045 Bitcoin. Currently, MicroStrategy possesses approximately 140,000 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $4.4 billion.\n\nDespite reporting a net loss of $143.4 million in its most recent quarterly report, MicroStrategy continued to strengthen its Bitcoin holdings by acquiring 6,067 Bitcoin for $167 million. This accumulation now represents roughly 0.75% of Bitcoin's total circulating supply.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) resumed its rally in November before taking a dip earlier last week. However, the cryptocurrency rebounded to hit a new high for 2023 on Nov 24. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s most prominent cryptocurrency, hit the $38,000 mark for the first time this year on Friday.\n\nThis is the first time the cryptocurrency has traded past the $38,000 mark since May 2022. This year has been great for the cryptocurrency market after a disappointing 2022, with Bitcoin leading from the front.\n\nBitcoin finally settled just above $37,400. The recent rally marks the resurgence of cryptocurrencies. Not only Bitcoin but also other cryptocurrencies have made a solid turnaround this year.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has gained 126.2% year to date, Ethereum (ETH) closed above $2,070 on Friday and has now surged 74.2% year to date. Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have jumped 57.5% and 10.3%, respectively, year to date.\n\nThere have been several factors contributing to the cryptocurrency rally. One major factor is the resolution of legal issues faced by Binance.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has reportedly agreed to plead guilty to federal criminal charges.\n\nThis resolution has restored confidence among investors, alleviating concerns about the exchange's future and is also helping the broader cryptocurrency market stabilize.\n\nMany now believe that with the Binance investigation resolved, the path for a Bitcoin ETF approval will now be clear. Market participants believe that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF is likely to play a major catalyst in driving the cryptocurrency market to new highs.\n\nSeparately, the Federal Reserve has maintained its hawkish approach and the minutes of the November FOMC meeting suggest that officials are still open to more hikes. However, as of now, they are more inclined toward maintaining a cautious approach.\n\nInvestors are, however, confident that the Federal Reserve will refrain from hiking interest rates in December as inflation declined further in October. Higher interest rates usually have an adverse effect on growth-focused sectors like technology, consumer discretionary industries, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc.

The sales came as the price of bitcoin, which has nearly doubled this year, temporarily surpassed $38,000 for the first time in about a year and a half.\n\n\n\nDespite ARK offloading the shares, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas clarified in a post on the X social-media platform formerly known as Twitter that he doesn\u2019t think the move indicates a lack of bullishness on the part of ARK.\n\n\u201cWith ARK you gotta look at weightings history before you begin interpretation,\u201d he tweeted in response to what he said was \"another article on how ARK is selling GBTC and how that means they aren\u2019t really bullish on BTC and/or they making room for ARKB. Neither is true.\"\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Race\n\nLast week, ARK was the first of the major firms to disclose a fee for their prospective spot bitcoin ETF, according to a filing.\n\nMany firms have recently added updates to their spot bitcoin ETF filings, including WisdomTree Investments on Nov. 16, signaling that conversations with the Securities and Exchange Commission are steadily progressing toward a potential approval.\n\nThe SEC, which delayed its decision in September, must decide on ARK's application by Jan. 11, the earliest deadline for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhile the SEC has approved cryptocurrency ETFs that track digital asset futures, the largest being the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the agency has thus far denied and delayed its decision on applications for ETFs that track physically backed cryptocurrency on the grounds of market manipulation. Despite investors excitement for a spot fund, the SEC has continued to delay its decisions on applications, most recently punting on a filing from Brazilian cryptocurrency firm Hashdex.\n\nStory continues\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

Casa co-founder and CTO Jameson Lopp also verified the signature.\n\nHowever, if the wallet is compromised, the message could have also been signed by an attacker, Mononaut added. The transaction was mined by AntPool in block 818,087, according to the blockchain explorer Blockchair. The previous record $500,000 fee paid in September was subsequently identified as a \u201cfat finger\u201d overpayment by the crypto services provider Paxos. F2Pool, the miner facilitating that transaction, agreed to reimburse that fee to Paxos. It is unclear whether AntPool would be willing to come to a similar agreement, but if it did, the Bitcoin mining pool would need another way to verify the victim\u2019s identity.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nCommunity member \u201cniftydev\u201d said they knew the person behind the 83_5BTC account and claimed they were the owner, not an attacker.\n\nAntPool has not yet publicly commented on the transaction and did not return a request for comment from The Block.\n\nLow-entropy wallet\n\nAccording to Mononaut, the most likely cause was a low-entropy wallet, meaning it was created with insufficient randomness, making it vulnerable to hacking. The transaction was quickly fee-bumped using replace-by-fee (RBF) \u2014 a Bitcoin protocol feature that allows a sender to increase the transaction fee on an unconfirmed transaction, enabling it to be processed more quickly by the network. If it was indeed a low-entropy wallet, multiple attackers could have been competing to steal the funds, Mononaut suggested, explaining the high fee, with scripts configured to spend a significant proportion of the transaction to hinder competitors.\n\nMononaut later noted that the fee paid was exactly 60% of the total 139.42 BTC stolen, and the potential attacker also swept 0.001 BTC from the same address, paying 0.0006 BTC in fees. \u201cThis, combined with the speed of the theft, seems like reasonable evidence for an automated script set to pay a fixed 60% of the value in fees to steal coins sent to vulnerable addresses,\u201d Mononaut said, with the 60% fee replacing an initial fee worth exactly 51% of the transaction which could have been from a different attacker or part of the same strategy.\n\n\u201cLet this be a reminder not to take shortcuts with your entropy, and ideally to use multisig for very large sums,\u201d Mononaut added."

As a strong supporter of the Bitcoin ecosystem, Kiyosaki recommended his over 2.4 million followers on X (formerly Twitter) to reduce their exposure to fiat currencies, which he called the \u201cfake money system.\u201d\n\nGreat News Gold reaches new high.

Our \u201cWoke\u201d\u2026 \u2014 Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 23, 2023\n\nHe said he continues to move his fiat assets into Bitcoin and precious metals because \u201cleaders don\u2019t care about you,\u201d and their actions boil down to war and poverty. On Oct. 20, Kiyosaki predicted that gold price would soon reach $2,100, and he expects the price to rally to $3,700 in the near future.\n\nRelated: Robert Kiyosaki calls Bitcoin a \u2018buying opportunity\u2019 as US dollar surges\n\nIn August 2023, Kiyosaki predicted that Bitcoin would reach $100,000, considering the geopolitical issues threatening global prosperity.\n\nBITCOIN to $100k.

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum in the UK - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "To navigate the process of buying Bitcoin effectively, it is essential to explore secure options. In the United Kingdom, acquiring cryptocurrencies is legal, yet it can pose challenges, as the government underscores the need to comprehend the associated risks.\n\nFor an effective traversal of the crypto landscape, investors should follow key steps, including choosing the right crypto exchange or broker, setting up a secure wallet and making informed decisions regarding payments and orders.\n\nThis article examines how to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) in the U.K. while offering information on legal considerations, secure storage options, cryptocurrency exchanges and brokers for effortless market navigation.\n\nIs it legal to buy Bitcoin and Ether in the U.K.?\n\nWhile the legal status of cryptocurrencies varies from one country to another, buying Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) is entirely legal in the U.K., with a well-defined regulatory framework in place. Cryptocurrencies are categorized as taxable assets by His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and they are subject to taxation.\n\nAcquiring Bitcoin and Ether in the U.K. triggers the tax reporting and payment obligations associated with cryptocurrency transactions. As such, maintaining accurate records is crucial for individuals planning to purchase BTC and ETH in the United Kingdom. This ensures compliance with tax regulations for both crypto gains and crypto losses.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that in the U.K., cryptocurrencies are not recognized as legal tender like the British pound. This regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies helps to foster innovation and promote awareness of associated risks, creating a transparent, legal environment for buying, selling and holding Bitcoin and Ether.\n\nIn October 2023, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) expanded its regulatory oversight to include crypto asset promotions in the U.K., emphasizing compliance with accurate information and risk warnings. Additionally, starting in September 2023, the Travel Rule mandates that U.K.-based crypto asset businesses are required to collect, verify and share information on transfers, which impacts the pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrencies.\n\nDespite industry engagement, some market players have exited the U.K., highlighting the importance of adhering to rules and regulations when using exchanges to buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nSecure wallet practices to safeguard Bitcoin and Ether holdings\n\nPrior to delving into Bitcoin and Ether investments, it\u2019s essential to have a secure crypto wallet, available in various forms. While leaving holdings on an exchange account is convenient for small quantities, transitioning to a more secure storage solution can be an option for those investors who want to store larger amounts of tokens.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s crucial to remember that retaining funds on an exchange means lacking control over the keys and, consequently, forfeiting control over the coins, emphasizing the importance of securing private keys for the full control and ownership of digital assets.\n\nBitcoin wallets, including hardware, software and paper options, are used to securely manage and store Bitcoin holdings, while Ethereum wallets act as secure repositories for ETH, providing control over assets and facilitating transactions.\n\nCryptocurrency users rely on Bitcoin and Ether wallets to safeguard and control their digital assets, ensuring the secure management of private keys essential for accessing and managing their holdings.\n\nRelated: A beginner\u2019s guide to filing cryptocurrency taxes in the US, UK and Germany\n\nTo reduce risk, an investor can enhance security by transferring their cryptocurrency from an exchange\u2019s default wallet to their own cold wallet, which is not online and thus less susceptible to hacking.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these wallets don\u2019t store investor\u2019s cryptocurrencies per se; instead, they safeguard the private keys necessary for accessing the wallet\u2019s address and authorizing transactions. Losing these digital keys means forfeiting access to Bitcoin and Ether holdings.\n\nBuying Bitcoin and Ether in the U.K. through crypto exchanges\n\nInvestors need to choose a broker or cryptocurrency exchange before they can purchase cryptocurrencies. Although both enable cryptocurrency purchases in the U.K., it\u2019s important to note some significant distinctions between them. Due to the growing possibility of hacks in the cryptocurrency space, choosing the best cryptocurrency exchange or broker can be a challenging process, with security being the main priority.\n\nChoose a crypto exchange\n\nIn the U.K., crypto assets and crypto exchanges operate without formal regulation, but the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) mandates registration for crypto exchanges within the country. Notably, some crypto exchanges such as Gemini, Bitpanda, Kraken and Crypto.com are successfully registered with the FCA.\n\nGiven the extreme volatility and absence of government-backed protection for cryptocurrency investments, exercising caution and acknowledging the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies is vital, even when dealing with FCA-authorized and regulated providers. To enhance security, an investor can also diversify their digital currency holdings across multiple exchanges to mitigate the risk of a single exchange failure.\n\nWhen choosing a crypto exchange, check for BTC and ETH availability, but also ensure there\u2019s substantial daily trading volume to guarantee adequate liquidity for smooth transactions in both cryptocurrencies and fiat currency. Also, watch out for fees that can affect returns, especially for high-frequency traders, and ensure the exchange offers desired trading types such as limit orders and margins.\n\nIn response to updated regulatory guidelines from the FCA and the expanded parameters of the Regime of Financial Promotions, CEX.IO and Binance announced in 2023 that they had suspended onboarding new U.K.-based consumers. Therefore, verifying an exchange\u2019s availability in the U.K. and compliance with regulatory changes is essential for informed decision-making.\n\nChoose a cryptocurrency broker\n\nCryptocurrency brokers, such as interactive brokers and eToro, simplify the crypto buying process with user-friendly interfaces that interact with exchanges for investors. While some cryptocurrency brokers charge higher fees, others offer their services for free but profit by selling traders\u2019 data or executing user trades at suboptimal market prices.\n\nWhile brokers offer convenience, they may limit the transfer of cryptocurrency holdings from their trading platforms. This restriction can be a concern for investors seeking enhanced security through crypto wallets, including hardware wallets disconnected from the internet. However, brokers can restrict investors from moving their crypto holdings to external wallets.\n\nDecide on a payment option\n\nAfter selecting a cryptocurrency broker or exchange, investors can sign up to open an account and fund it through options like linking a bank account or using debit or credit cards, though the latter may incur high fees.\n\nUpon creating an account and selecting a payment method, identity verification is mandatory. For example, the submission of an identity document and proof of address is a common requirement in the United Kingdom. Investors may also encounter a crypto risk awareness quiz. Depending on the broker or exchange, there might be a wait of a few days before the deposited funds can be used to buy cryptocurrency.\n\nPlace an order\n\nAfter funding their account, investors can proceed to place their order for purchasing Bitcoin or Ether by entering the desired amount in pounds. The process varies by exchange; some have a straightforward \u201cBuy\u201d button for BTC and ETH, which prompts users to enter the desired amount.\n\nMost exchanges enable the purchase of fractional cryptocurrency shares, making it feasible to own portions of higher-priced tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum that would typically require significant investment.\n\nStore Bitcoin and Ether\n\nAs previously noted, cryptocurrency exchanges run the additional risk of theft or hacking and are not protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme of the United Kingdom. If cryptocurrency owners misplace or forget their private keys or recovery phrases, they could forfeit their entire investment.\n\nWhen purchasing cryptocurrency on a crypto exchange, it is typically retained in a wallet connected to the exchange. If desired, investors can store or withdraw Bitcoin and Ether to a chosen external wallet for added security. However, investors purchasing cryptocurrency through a broker might not have much control over where it is kept.\n\nIf an investor is interested in transferring their digital currency to a securer place or doesn\u2019t like the provider the exchange collaborates with, they may move it off the exchange and into an independent hot or cold wallet. Depending on the exchange and the total amount of a transfer, investors may be required to pay a small charge in order to accomplish this.\n\nCryptocurrency ATMs\n\nCrypto ATMs have been appearing in cities all over the world; however, in February 2023, the FCA imposed a ban on cryptocurrency ATMs and urged operators to shut down their machines or face enforcement actions.\n\nThe FCA warns that using these machines is risky, as they operate unlawfully and provide no protection in case of issues, and communication with operators is often challenging. The FCA aims to keep cautioning the public and taking enforcement measures against unregistered crypto ATM operators.\n\nCrypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs): An alternative to directly holding Bitcoin and Ether\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide diversified exposure to multiple holdings within a single investment, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. Investment trusts pool investors\u2019 funds through the sale of a set number of shares, which may have some initial trust-related challenges upon launch. This structure provides instant diversification and reduces risk compared to picking individual investments.\n\nInvestors can now access multiple cryptocurrencies simultaneously through various firms. ETF providers such as Purpose Investments and VanEck offer opportunities for investors to engage in the crypto market.\n\nOther methods to buy Bitcoin and Ether in the U.K.\n\nSeveral U.K. banking and financial apps, such as PayPal, Revolut, Skrill and MoonPay, have introduced the ability for customers to purchase Bitcoin and Ether directly on their platforms. To purchase shares in companies that are publicly listed, they will require an online account.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that JPMorgan\u2019s U.K. bank, Chase, took a different stance in October 2023 by prohibiting cryptocurrency transactions for its British customers due to a notable increase in fraud and scams, including fake investments and deceptive celebrity endorsements.\n\nAdditionally, payment processors, such as BitPay, can be used to buy BTC and ETH. Once connected, users can initiate transactions through the payment processor, converting fiat currency into Bitcoin or Ether.\n\nMoreover, in the U.K., traders can utilize peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto platforms, such as Cash App and Paxful, to trade digital assets, although the government emphasizes the risks associated with these assets. P2P platforms enable direct cryptocurrency transactions between individuals and are a prevalent means of acquiring digital currencies in the United Kingdom. However, it\u2019s important to be aware that U.K. investors have limited legal protections in the event of platform insolvency."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $38,000 on Nov. 24, but the bulls could not build upon this strength. This suggests hesitation to buy at higher levels. Bitcoin is on track to form a Doji candlestick pattern on the weekly chart for the second consecutive week. This signals indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.\n\nWith Bitcoin maintaining near its 18-month high, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes retained his bullish stance. In a X (formerly Twitter) post, Hayes said that the United States dollar liquidity was increasing, which is likely to push Bitcoin higher.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAnother bullish projection came from PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow family of BTC price models, who said in a post on X that Bitcoin may not stay at the current levels for long. PlanB expects Bitcoin to maintain an average price of at least $100,000 between 2024 and 2028.\n\nAnalysts have turned increasingly bullish in the past few days, but traders should exercise caution because every uptrend is bound to have corrections.\n\nCould Bitcoin soar above $38,000 or start a corrective phase? Let\u2019s look at the charts of the top 5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin\u2019s march higher has hit a wall near $37,980 but the bulls are not hurrying to close their positions. This shows that traders expect the uptrend to progress further.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe immediate support on the downside is the 20-day exponential moving average ($36,546). If the price snaps back from this support, it will signal that every minor dip is being purchased. That will increase the possibility of a break above $37,980.\n\nIf that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to $40,000. This level may pose a strong hurdle to the bulls, but if buyers flip the $38,000 level into support on the downside, the rally could stretch to $48,000.\n\nConversely, if the price plummets below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are booking profits. The pair may then dump to $34,800.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls are trying to maintain the price above the moving averages but are finding it difficult to overcome the obstacle at $37,980. The relative strength index (RSI) is just above the midpoint, indicating that the bullish momentum is weakening.\n\nIf the price slips below the 50-simple moving average, the pair may plunge to the uptrend line. The bulls are expected to defend this level with vigor. On the upside, a break and close above $38,500 will indicate that bulls are in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nUniswap price analysis\n\nUniswap (UNI) fell below the 20-day EMA ($5.44) on Nov. 21, but the lower levels attracted aggressive buying by the bulls. That started a sharp rally on Nov. 22, which pushed the price to $6.60 on Nov. 24.\n\nUNI/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe up-move is facing selling near the overhead resistance of $6.70. The UNI/USDT pair has pulled back to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $5.92, and the next stop could be the 50% retracement level of $5.71.\n\nA strong bounce off this zone will suggest that traders view the dips as a buying opportunity. That may enhance the prospects of a breakout above $6.70. Such a move will complete a double bottom pattern, which has a target objective of $9.60. The bullish momentum is likely to weaken below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $5.50.\n\nThe bulls tried to protect the 20-EMA, but the bears had other plans. They pulled the price below the 20-EMA, starting a deeper correction. If the price sustains below the 20-EMA, the pair may tumble to the 50-SMA.\n\nIf the price turns up from the current level or bounces off the 50-SMA, it will suggest that lower levels are being bought. The bulls will then again try to propel the price to the overhead resistance of $6.70. If this resistance is surmounted, the pair may skyrocket to $7.80.\n\nImmutable price analysis\n\nImmutable (IMX) has been sustaining above the breakout level of $1.30 for the past several days, suggesting that bulls have the edge.\n\nIMX/USDT daily chart.

This zone is likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears, but If the buyers prevail, the IMX/USDT pair could climb to $1.86.\n\nInstead, if sellers tug the price below the support zone, it may trigger stops of short-term traders. That could accelerate selling and result in a sharper correction to the psychological level of $1.\n\nThe 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart has flattened out, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a possible consolidation in the near term. The first support on the downside is $1.30. If buyers maintain the price above this level, it will suggest that the $1.30 is acting as a new floor.\n\nOn the upside, a break above $1.50 will signal the resumption of the up-move. The pair may travel to $1.59 and then to $1.63. Contrary to this assumption, a fall below $1.20 could tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nRelated: XRP price bull flag hints at 20% rally by New Year\u2019s\n\nVeChain price analysis\n\nBuyers propelled VeChain (VET) above the overhead resistance of $0.023 on Nov. 26 but are struggling to sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.\n\nVET/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSellers will try to trap the aggressive bulls and pull the price to the 20-day EMA ($0.021). If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest a positive sentiment. The bulls will then again attempt to overcome the obstacle at $0.023. If they can pull it off, the VET/USDT pair could rise to $0.027 and thereafter try to reach the pattern target of $0.031.\n\nOn the contrary, if bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the pair may remain stuck inside a large range between $0.014 and $0.023 for a while longer.\n\nThe pair has slipped back below the breakout level of $0.023, indicating that the bears have not given up and are selling at higher levels. The pair could next reach the 20-EMA, which is an important level to watch out for.\n\nIf the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will make another attempt to drive the price above $0.023 and start the next leg of the rally to $0.027. On the other hand, a break below the 20-EMA may start a deeper correction to $0.020.\n\nAlgorand price analysis\n\nAlgorand (ALGO) reached the overhead resistance of $0.14 on Nov. 25, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense.\n\nALGO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf the bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will suggest that traders are holding on to their positions, expecting a move higher. That increases the likelihood of a rally above the $0.14-$0.15 resistance zone. If that happens, the ALGO/USDT pair will complete a cup-and-handle pattern. This reversal setup has a pattern target of $0.20.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to drag the price below the critical support at $0.12. If this level gives way, the pair may tumble to $0.11 and then to $0.09.\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the pair is oscillating inside the $0.12 to $0.15 range for some time. In a range, traders usually buy near the support and sell close to the resistance. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty; hence, traders may consider waiting for the breakout before taking large bets.\n\nIf the price breaks above $0.15, the pair is likely to start the next leg of the up-move. The pair may first rise to $0.18 and then to $0.20. This positive view will be invalidated if the price turns down and falls below $0.12.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) briefly reached $38,000 on Nov. 24 but faced formidable resistance at the price level. On Nov. 27, Bitcoin price traded below $37,000, which is unchanged from a week ago.\n\nWhat is eye-catching is the unwavering strength of BTC derivatives, which signals that bulls remain steadfast in their intentions.\n\nAn intriguing development is unfolding in China as Tether (USDT) trades below its fair value in the local currency, the yuan. This discrepancy often arises due to differing expectations between professional traders engaged in derivatives and retail clients involved in the spot market.\n\nHow have regulations impacted Bitcoin derivatives?\n\nTo gauge the exposure of whales and arbitrage desks using Bitcoin derivatives, one must assess BTC options volume. By examining the put (sell) and call (buy) options, we can estimate the prevailing bullish or bearish sentiment.\n\nDeribit BTC options put-to-call volume ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nSince Nov. 22, put options have consistently lagged behind call options in volume, by an average of 40%. This suggests a diminished demand for protective measures \u2014 a surprising development given the intensified regulatory scrutiny following Binance\u2019s plea deal with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s lawsuit against the Kraken exchange.\n\nWhile investors may not foresee disruptions to Binance\u2019s services, the likelihood of further regulatory actions against exchanges serving U.S. clients has surged. Additionally, individuals who previously relied on obscuring their activity might now think twice as the DOJ gains access to historical transactions.\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s uncertain whether the arrangement former CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao struck with authorities will extend to other unregulated exchanges and payment gateways. In summary, the repercussions of recent regulatory actions remain uncertain, and the prevailing sentiment is pessimistic, with investors fearing additional constraints and potential actions targeting market makers and stablecoin issuers.\n\nTo determine if the Bitcoin options market is an anomaly, let\u2019s examine BTC futures contracts, specifically the monthly ones \u2014 preferred by professional traders due to their fixed funding rate in neutral markets. Typically, these instruments trade at a 5% to 10% premium to account for the extended settlement period.\n\nBitcoin 30-day futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nBetween Nov. 24 and 26, the BTC futures premium flirted with excessive optimism, hovering around 12%. However, by Nov. 27, it dipped to 9% as Bitcoin\u2019s price tested the $37,000 support \u2014 a neutral level but close to the bullish threshold.\n\nRetail traders are less optimistic after ETF hopium fades\n\nMoving on to retail interest, there is a growing sense of apathy due to the absence of a short-term positive trigger, such as the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The SEC is not expected to make its final decision until January or February 2024.\n\nThe USDT premium relative to the yuan hit its lowest point in over four months on the OKX exchange. This premium serves as a gauge of demand among China-based retail crypto traders and measures the gap between peer-to-peer trades and the U.S. dollar.\n\nUSDT peer-to-peer vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKX\n\nSince Nov. 20, USDT has been trading at a discount, suggesting either a significant desire to liquidate cryptocurrencies or heightened regulatory concerns. In either case, it\u2019s far from a positive indicator. Furthermore, the last instance of a 1% positive premium occurred 30 days ago, indicating that retail traders aren\u2019t particularly enthused about the recent rally toward $38,000.\n\nRelated: What\u2019s next for Binance\u2019s Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao?\n\nIn essence, professional traders remain unfazed by short-term corrections, regardless of the regulatory landscape. Contrary to doomsday predictions, Binance\u2019s status remains unaffected, and the lower trading volume on unregulated exchanges may boost the chances of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nThe disparity in time horizons may explain the divide between professional traders\u2019 and retail investors\u2019 optimism. Additionally, recent regulatory actions could pave the way for increased participation by institutional investors, offering a potential upside in the future.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "The Risks of Stablecoins: Exploring The Bitcoin-Dollar With Mark Goodwin - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Understanding Stablecoins\n\nStablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that aims to maintain a stable value by pegging it to another asset, such as a fiat currency, precious metal, or a basket of assets. Stablecoins have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their potential to address some of the limitations of traditional cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is known for its price volatility, stablecoins provide a more price stable alternative, making them suitable for various use cases.\n\nOne of the most prominent ways stablecoins are marketed is in regards to their ability to act as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset space. By pegging their value to a stable asset, stablecoins provide a reliable medium of exchange and store of value. This stability makes stablecoins more attractive for merchants and consumers alike, as they can confidently transact without worrying about sudden price fluctuations.\n\nStablecoins also theoretically offer benefits in terms of transaction speed and cost-efficiency. Traditional banking systems often involve lengthy settlement times and high fees for cross-border transactions. In contrast, stablecoins can facilitate near-instantaneous transactions with lower fees, making them an attractive option for global commerce.\n\nFurthermore, stablecoins can serve as a hedge against inflation in countries with unstable economies or volatile fiat currencies. By holding stablecoins backed by stronger currencies, individuals and businesses can protect their wealth from devaluation and maintain a more stable financial position.\n\nIt is important to note that there are different types of stablecoins, each with its own mechanism for maintaining stability. Some stablecoins are backed by reserves of the pegged asset, while others rely on algorithms and smart contracts to regulate supply and demand.\n\nThe Concept of The Bitcoin-Dollar\n\nBitcoin offers a politically and neutral platform and asset, but this comes with the cost of high volatility in terms of price and purchasing power. Stablecoins on the other hand offer an ultimately centralized and controlled platform and asset, with the gained benefit of stability in price and purchasing power. These two technologies in a way represent two sides of the same coin, the yin and the yang. In addition to that, the largest market for Bitcoin in the world is the US dollar. Worldwide if people are attempting to ascertain the price of Bitcoin, they are most likely to look at its price in dollars. Those markets are also highly likely to be traded against stablecoins rather than the dollar proper outside of US jurisdictions.\n\nThis creates a degree of symbiosis between the two because of that. Wherever Bitcoin goes, the dollar follows in some sense. The dollar price of Bitcoin, and very frequently the use of stablecoins, follows Bitcoin everywhere it goes. The reality of this dynamic ensures with a high likelihood that everywhere Bitcoin becomes adopted due to unstable local currencies and economies, dollar based stablecoins will likely be adopted to some degree.\n\nGiven this dynamic, it\u2019s possible that the growth in adoption of Bitcoin may actually help facilitate the growth and stability of the US dollar in the process. If growing adoption of Bitcoin leads to growing adoption of stablecoins, and stablecoins necessarily require holding dollars or a dollar equivalent like a treasury bond to back them, then the narrative of Bitcoin usurping and undermining the dollar might wind up falling flat. At least for the foreseeable future.\n\nMark Goodwin's Perspective on Stablecoins\n\nWho is Mark Goodwin?\n\nMark Goodwin is the author of The Bitcoin-Dollar and Bitcoin expert and advocate for decentralized financial systems. With extensive experience in the industry, Goodwin has offered valuable insights into the world of stablecoins and their potential impact on the financial ecosystem.\n\nGoodwin's Critiques of Stablecoins\n\nGoodwin's critiques of stablecoins stem from concerns about centralization and the potential for abuse or manipulation. While stablecoins aim to provide stability, the reliance on trusted custodians and centralized reserves introduces counterparty risks. Goodwin suggests that further efforts of perpetuating the US Treasury market due to stablecoin issuers purchasing Treasuries en masse should be met with extreme caution and apprehension from Bitcoiners.\n\nThe Risks Associated with Stablecoins\n\nPrice Stability Concerns\n\nWhile stablecoins attempt to maintain a stable value, there can still be risks associated with maintaining the peg to the underlying asset. Factors such as market conditions, liquidity disparities, and redemption pressures can challenge the stability of stablecoins. If these risks are not adequately managed, it can result in deviation from the peg and potential loss of trust from users.\n\nRegulatory Challenges\n\nThe regulatory landscape surrounding stablecoins is still developing, and this poses challenges for their widespread adoption. Regulatory authorities worldwide are closely monitoring stablecoins, considering their potential implications for financial stability and consumer protection. It is essential for stablecoin projects to navigate these regulatory challenges effectively to ensure their long-term success.\n\nPotential for Market Manipulation\n\nStablecoins, with their substantial market capitalization and liquidity, can be targets for market manipulation. The rapid expansion of the cryptocurrency space, coupled with limited oversight, creates opportunities for individuals or entities to manipulate stablecoin markets for personal gain. Enhanced transparency and regulatory frameworks can help mitigate these risks and ensure market integrity.\n\nStablecoins attempt to offer the promise of stability and accessibility in the world of decentralized finance. However, they also come with risks and challenges that need to be carefully addressed. As the market evolves and regulatory frameworks develop, stablecoins have the potential to further push the dollar\u2019s reach across the world and thus careful considerations are essential to mitigate the associated risks of further centralizing the global economy within a select few private capital creators.\n\nNews of the Week (11/20/2023 - 11/24/2023)\n\nWho is Javier Milei? The Argentinian President that everyone is talking about.\n\nWhile labeled as \u201cFar Right\u201d, \u201cThe Wig\u201d, \u201cCrazy\u201d, \u201cThe Lion\u201d, \u201cRadical\u201d, \u201cThe Libertarian\u201d are some of the words used to describe him he is more than meets the eye.\n\nBefore becoming President of Latin America's 2nd largest economy. He lived a multi facet life. He was a soccer player in the 1980\u2019s, an economist, and playing in a rock band called Everest.\n\nHe rose to prominence as the leader of the political party \u201cLa Libertad Avanza\u201d (Freedom Advances) and gained attention in politics for his provocative style.\n\nNow 53 years old, Milei identifies as an anarcho-capitalist and holds two postgraduate degrees, having graduated from University of Belgrano.\n\nMilei identifies as a proponent of economic liberalism and adheres to the Austrian school of economic thought, which advocates minimal government intervention in the economy and deregulation of markets.\n\nSome of Milei\u2019s key proposals are as followed:\n\n\n\nHe strongly advocates for dollarizing Argentina\u2019s economy and intends to shut down the central bank, holding it responsible for the country's high inflation.\n\nHe advocates for dramatic cuts in social spending, which is a controversial stance in a country with a history of social welfare programs.\n\nHe has suggested cutting ties with Argentina\u2019s two most important trade partners, Brazil and China, a move that could have significant economic implications.\n\nHis campaign is marked by symbolic acts, such as brandishing a chainsaw to symbolize the fiscal adjustments he deems necessary.\n\nSome critics view Milei as an unstable leader for an economically unstable country. While others view him as the salvation to Argentina\u2019s never ending inflation, corruption, rising state debts, and looming recession.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "FILE PHOTO: A bitcoin is seen in an illustration picture taken at La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris\n\nBy Medha Singh and Lisa Pauline Mattackal\n\n(Reuters) - It's next-level stuff.\n\n\"Layer 2\" cryptocurrencies native to projects built on top of \"layer 1\" blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum - have found a new lease of life after a year in the doldrums, buoyed by a rising crypto tide.\n\nAnticipation of easing U.S. borrowing costs and a possible U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund have lifted crypto prices since the summer, with market bitcoin gaining by about half since the end of August.\n\nTokens associated with layer 2 projects - which typically aim to speed up transactions and cut costs - have a combined market cap of about $14.3 billion, about a tenth of the total crypto market, according to data from CoinMaketCap.com.\n\nMatic, the largest layer 2 token with a market cap of $6.90 billion, has jumped 20% to $0.74 over the past 30 days, according to CoinGecko. It's used on Polygon, a platform that reduces congestion on the Ethereum network.\n\nThe next four largest coins - immutable, mantle, arbitrum and optimism - have leapt between 9% and 105% over the past month and trade between $0.5 to under $2 apiece.\n\nAll five tokens are down between 16% and 86% from their all-time highs hit over the past two years, though.\n\nEther, the layer 1 token linked to the Ethereum blockchain on which most layer 2 tokens are based, has leapt 13.8% to $2,028.80 in the past month.\n\nLayer 2 tokens, which have proliferated in recent years, can be a risky business. They are small and thinly traded, meaning they can be highly volatile and unpredictable. Picking long-term winners is tough.\n\n\"On average, the growth is not sustainable for those tokens ... 100 try and one wins,\" said Matteo Greco, research analyst at digital asset and fintech investment firm Fineqia International.\n\n\"There's always a bit of thin air behind the moves.\"\n\nPrice performance is also patchy.\n\nMatic has fallen about 3% in 2023, while gaming token immutable has more than tripled in price, versus bitcoin's 123% and ether's 69% gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nSPECULATIVE CHARACTER\n\nLayer 2 tokens are a gauge of sentiment towards the projects they are linked to, but their extreme volatility also lends them a speculative character. They are often among the last ones to catch a bid when broader crypto market rises and among the first ones to sell off when sentiment is shaken.\n\nWhile layer 2 tokens are tiny in comparison to big guns like bitcoin, their volatility makes them a favorite among active traders trying to capitalize on market momentum.\n\n\"They can be very attractive investments even though they can be very speculative,\" said Joshua Peck, chief investment officer at hedge fund TrueCode Capital, whose fund invests in matic. \"For a token that's down 97%, it doesn't take a lot of capital inflow for it to go three times, four times, five times in price.\"\n\n\"Active trading is the right approach for these tokens because the market is moving so much,\" Peck added.\n\nThe future of layer 2 tokens is unclear.\n\nSome analysts see the projects as vital to increasing the practical uses of blockchains like Ethereum, in areas such as finance to gaming.\n\nYet the market is crowded. Numerous projects and their tokens were launched as the crypto market boomed in 2020, before sinking during the crypto winter of 2022.\n\n\"The space feels 'unserious' right now ... in terms of being able to point to an example of something you'd like to run your business or family's personal finances on,\" said Alyse Killeen, managing partner at venture capital firm Stillmark.\n\nMany investors agree that only projects with useful practical applications will survive.\n\n\"In these macro phases, the use cases are not really so important. The real difference between assets that have decent use cases and assets that don't is (in) the bear market,\" said Fineqia International's Greco.\n\n\"Assets that have good use cases are able to resist the downtrend even though they get hit hard.\"\n\n(Reporting by Lisa Mattackal and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Tom Wilson and)"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin held on Monday to most of the gains made over Thanksgiving week, with continued anticipation regarding the coin\u2019s upcoming halving event and optimism surrounding the still-unconfirmed approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF keeping the cryptocurrency hovering near highs not seen in well over a year.\n\nThe world\u2019s top cryptocurrency currently sits at $36,940 according to data from CoinGecko. That\u2019s a slight 3.27% drop from Friday, when Bitcoin smashed through $38,000 for the first time since the crypto market\u2019s collapse in May 2022.\n\nAll in all, BTC appears to be generally accumulating\u2014and retaining\u2014value in anticipation of multiple events likely slated for the new year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn April, the cryptocurrency is set to undergo its latest \u201chalving\u201d, which will reduce the amount of BTC available to be claimed through Bitcoin mining by 50%. Given the likely proportional drop in new BTC flooding the market that the occasion is set to trigger, many anticipate the event will deflate BTC market supply, and therefore increase the coin\u2019s price.\n\nHalvings will continue until no new BTC is produced, and the coin reaches a final supply of 21 million tokens. There are currently about 19.5 million BTC in circulation.\n\nIn the last week, other indicators have pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s network health improving in the run up to April\u2019s halving. The network\u2019s hash rate hit 491 exahashes per second last week\u2014an impressive computer power usage statistic that speaks to Bitcoin\u2019s current high level of mining activity, and, correspondingly, safety.\n\nThis increased hash rate is likely due to miners using new, more efficient machines purchased in anticipation of April\u2019s halving, Bitcoin analyst Henrike Christin M\u00fcller previously told Decrypt.\n\nFurther pushing Bitcoin\u2019s encouraging price gains this last month have been persistent rumors that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might finally approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, which would allow traditional financial institutions and investors to gain exposure to BTC without owning any cryptocurrency. Blockchain analysts at CryptoQuant have previously said the product could lead to a $1 trillion boost for Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThough the SEC recently opted to punt decisions about several Bitcoin ETFs into the new year, there have been recent indicators that financial behemoth BlackRock might be on track to list the financial product in the near future.\n\nBut regardless of the actual likelihood of an imminent approval of a Bitcoin ETF, market enthusiasm about the prospect is at an all-time high\u2014and even the slightest indicators of good news on the subject have continued to shoot BTC higher in recent weeks.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "title": "Better Bitcoin Stock: Coinbase Global vs. Marathon Digital - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) and Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) represent two very different ways to invest in the Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) market. Coinbase is one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, and it facilitates trades of Bitcoin, Ether (CRYPTO: ETH), Tether (CRYPTO: USDT), and other crypto assets. Marathon is a Bitcoin miner that mines its own Bitcoin with a massive fleet of high-end application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners.\n\nBoth stocks more than tripled this year as Bitcoin's price more than doubled. That rally was driven by stabilizing interest rates, potential approvals for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) pinned to Bitcoin's spot price, and its growing popularity as a safe haven asset. But should you invest in either of these Bitcoin-driven stocks right now?\n\nCoinbase still has a lot to prove\n\nCoinbase's stock might have outperformed Bitcoin's price this year, but it's still underperformed Bitcoin over the past two years. Coinbase generated weaker long-term gains than Bitcoin for three simple reasons.\n\nFirst, Coinbase only generated 38% of its trading volume from Bitcoin trades in its latest quarter. Another 19% came from Ether, 15% from the Tether stablecoin, and the remaining 28% from other crypto assets -- including smaller tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other speculative assets that flopped as interest rates rose. Its exposure to those slower-growth assets seems to be throttling its overall growth.\n\nSecond, its trading volume and revenue fell sequentially over the past two quarters, even as Bitcoin and Ether recovered. That slower trading activity suggests it's struggling to retain its users and assets. However, we can't be sure because it stopped disclosing its monthly transacting users (MTUs) and total assets on its platform this year. Lastly, the bulls are staying away as government regulators tighten their grip on Coinbase and its crypto peers.\n\nAnalysts expect Coinbase's revenue to dip 11% in 2023, compared to its 57% decline in 2022 and 545% growth in 2021. That grim outlook suggests the crypto winter is far from over.\n\nOn the bright side, its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) turned positive over the past three quarters as it reined in its spending, and its $5.5 billion in liquidity should give it plenty of time to stabilize its business and profit from the crypto market's eventual recovery.\n\nMarathon's mining business is still growing\n\nMarathon was once a tiny patent holding company. But in 2020, it abandoned that business model, rebranded itself as a Bitcoin miner, and ordered tens of thousands of ASIC miners to capitalize on the market's growing interest in Bitcoin.\n\nThe critics initially balked at that abrupt transformation, but Marathon is now the world's largest pure-play Bitcoin miner, with 157,160 deployed miners and a hash rate capacity of 23.1 EH/s (exahashes per second). For reference, its closest competitor, Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT), had deployed 106,674 miners with a hash rate capacity of 11.7 EH/s by the end of October. Marathon has mined 9,812 Bitcoin year to date, while Riot has only mined 4,996 Bitcoin.\n\nMarathon's revenue surged from $4 million in 2020 to $159 million in 2021, then declined 26% in 2022 as Bitcoin's price dropped. But in 2023, analysts expect its revenue to nearly triple to $347 million as Bitcoin's price rises, it opens two new plants, and it launches a new joint venture in Abu Dhabi. They also expect it to turn profitable by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and adjusted EBITDA measures.\n\nMarathon carries some of its mined Bitcoin on its balance sheet, but it also regularly liquidates some of those holdings to boost its own cash flows. It ended the third quarter of 2023 with $101 million in cash and $287 million in Bitcoin on its balance sheet -- representing the first time its total cash and Bitcoin position exceeded its total debt.\n\nThe better buy: Marathon Digital\n\nCoinbase's business might eventually stabilize, but it still isn't a bargain at 29 times next year's adjusted EBITDA. Marathon trades at just 18 times next year's adjusted EBITDA -- seemingly cheap relative to its near-term growth potential. Marathon also faces fewer regulatory threats than Coinbase, provides more exposure to Bitcoin, and is still expanding its mining operations. It's still a speculative stock, but I believe it could easily outperform Coinbase if Bitcoin continues to rally.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Coinbase Global\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe major crypto tokens were trading in the red on Monday, dragged by the losses in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap declined 1.26% to around $1.42 trillion in the last 24 hours.At 9.45 a.m., BTC was trading 1.05% lower at $37,321, while the second most popular token, Ethereum, was down 1.26% at $2,047.Other popular altcoins, such as Solana and Polygon, plunged 2.6% and 2.8%, respectively. Also, BNB XRP , Cardano, Tron, and Litecoin fell 1-2%.With steady resistance to cross the $38k mark, BTC held steady above $37k over the weekend. Investors feel that BTC\u2019s price action is beginning to show downside correction. If BTC fails to rise beyond $38k, it could see start a fresh decline for itself, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch VenturesHowever, if we don\u2019t look at BTC in isolation, many investors believe that it showcases upside potential for the crypto market, especially after Blackrock\u2019s BTC ETF (iShares Bitcoin Trust) presentation to the SEC representatives, Parth added.Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, said, \"Bitcoin breached the $38,000 threshold over the weekend. However, the bulls could not sustain this movement and the price consolidated around the $37,300 level. To keep the bullish momentum alive, Bitcoin will now need to clear the resistance around $37,700 or risk finding support around $37,100.\"The total volume in DeFi is currently $4.65 billion, 10.81% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $39.06 billion, which is 90.76% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, fell to $729 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 51.46%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours surged 71.4% to $14.82 billion.\"BTC has been consolidating for over three weeks within a broad range of $35,000 to $38,000. In the current week, BTC attempted to surpass the significant resistance at $38,000 but failed. A successful break and sustained hold above $38,000 would be considered a bullish sign. Conversely, breaking down the major incline trendline support at around $36,500 could lead to a decline in prices,\" said CoinDCX Research Team(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
