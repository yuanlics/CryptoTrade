        "title": "SEC asked Coinbase to halt trading in everything except bitcoin, CEO says - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission asked Coinbase to halt trading in all cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin prior to suing the exchange, in a sign of the agency\u2019s intent to assert regulatory authority over a broader slice of the market.\n\nCoinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong told the Financial Times that the SEC made the recommendation before launching legal action against the Nasdaq-listed company last month for failing to register as a broker.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s case identified 13 mostly lightly traded cryptocurrencies on Coinbase\u2019s platform as securities, asserting that by offering them to customers the exchange fell under the regulator\u2019s remit.\n\nBut the prior request for Coinbase to delist every one of the more than 200 tokens it offers \u2014 with the exception of flagship token bitcoin \u2014 indicates that the SEC, under chair Gary Gensler, has pushed for wider authority over the crypto industry.\n\n\u201cThey came back to us, and they said . . . we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cAnd, we said, well how are you coming to that conclusion, because that\u2019s not our interpretation of the law. And they said, we\u2019re not going to explain it to you, you need to delist every asset other than bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIf Coinbase had agreed, that could have set a precedent that would have left the vast majority of the American crypto businesses operating outside the law unless they registered with the commission.\n\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t have a choice at that point, delisting every asset other than bitcoin, which by the way is not what the law says, would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the US,\u201d he said. \u201cIt kind of made it an easy choice . . . let\u2019s go to court and find out what the court says.\u201d\n\nAccording to Brian Armstrong, if Coinbase had agreed, the vast majority of the American crypto businesses would risk operating outside the law unless they registered with the SEC \u00a9 Reuters\n\nOversight of the crypto industry has hitherto been a grey area, with the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission jockeying for control.\n\nThe CFTC sued the largest crypto exchange, Binance, in March of this year, three months before the SEC launched its own legal action against the company.\n\nGensler has previously said he believes most cryptocurrencies with the exception of bitcoin are securities. However, the recommendation to Coinbase signals that the SEC has adopted this interpretation in its attempts to regulate the industry.\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency, which is fundamental to many industry projects, was absent from the regulator\u2019s case against the exchange. It also did not feature in the list of 12 \u201ccrypto asset securities\u201d specified in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance.\n\nThe SEC said its enforcement division did not make formal requests for \u201ccompanies to delist crypto assets\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the course of an investigation, the staff may share its own view as to what conduct may raise questions for the commission under the securities laws,\u201d it added.\n\nStocks, bonds and other traditional financial instruments fall under the SEC\u2019s remit, but US authorities remain locked in debate as to whether all \u2014 or any \u2014 crypto tokens should fall under its purview.\n\nOversight by the SEC would bring far more stringent compliance standards. Crypto exchanges typically also provide custody services, and borrow and lend to customers, a mix of practices that is not possible for SEC-regulated companies.\n\n\u201cThere are a bunch of American companies who have built business models on the assumption that these crypto tokens aren\u2019t securities,\u201d said Charley Cooper, former CFTC chief of staff. \u201cIf they\u2019re told otherwise, many of them will have to stop operations immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to see how there could be any public offerings or retail trading of tokens without some sort of intervention from Congress,\u201d said Peter Fox, partner at law firm Scoolidge, Peters, Russotti & Fox.\n\nThe SEC declined to comment on the implications for the rest of the industry of a settlement involving Coinbase delisting every token other than bitcoin."

        "content": "Australian actress Margot Robbie, who plays the lead role in the new Barbie movie, has caused a stir within the crypto community after stating that talking about Bitcoin (BTC) reflects similar traits to Barbie\u2019s companion, Ken.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the crypto community on X (Twitter), including MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor and social media influencer Layah Heilpern, had a mixed response to Robbie\u2019s statement about Bitcoin in an interview with Fandango on June 22.\n\nRobbie revealed that every time she overheard her husband, Tom Ackerley, and television producer, David Heyman, discussing Bitcoin on set, it brought to mind the traits of Ken, the fictional co-star character in Barbie, played by Ryan Gosling.\n\n\u201cWhen David and Tom would start talking about Bitcoin or something, Gretta and I would be like, you\u2019re being such Kens!\u201d\n\nAlong with Saylor declaring that Bitcoin is, in fact, \u201cBig Ken Energy,\u201d several other prominent figures in the crypto industry shared their thoughts on Robbie\u2019s comments.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin spending copies history as metric flags \u20181st stage bull market\u2019\n\nCrypto influencer Lea Thompson, better known to her 225,000 Twitter followers as Girl Gone Crypto, stated that she is \u201cso bullish\u201d after hearing Robbie talk about Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoiners last week: yah haven't seen the Barbie movie, whatever, looks dumb\n\n\n\nBitcoiners today: MARGOT ROBBIE SAID THAT BITCOIN IS BIG KEN ENERGY, SO BULLISH \u2014 Girl Gone Crypto (@girlgone_crypto) July 29, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, Layah Heilpern perceived Robbie\u2019s remarks differently, suggesting that she interpreted it as an insult toward men who talk about Bitcoin.\n\nOn July 30, Heilpern explained to her 621,400 Twitter followers that Robbie implied male Bitcoin enthusiasts are \u201cweak and pathetic.\u201d\n\nWhen Margot Robbie said you\u2019re a Ken if talk #bitcoin\n\n\n\nShe meant you\u2019re weak and pathetic. This was not a good thing \u2014 Layah Heilpern (@LayahHeilpern) July 29, 2023\n\nHowever, Mark Travers, lead psychologist at Awake Therapy, suggested that having Ken\u2019s energy could be a sign of someone who is selfless and can adapt to different situations.\n\nTravers stated in a July 13 Forbes report that the character of Ken challenges traditional gender stereotypes.\n\n\u201cIn a universe which revolves around Barbie, Ken has only a supportive role to play, and he plays it gladly,\u201d Travers stated, adding:\n\n\u201cBarbie is and comes before everything, we see male counterpart Ken relegated to the uni-dimensional and purely aesthetic role that women have often been confined to in the past, in a flippant and parody-like manner.\u201d\n\nRobbie stated in the interview that it is hard to define what makes a Ken or what gives off Ken energy, as it can be subjective.\n\n\u201cIt is not something you can define; it is just something you can sense,\u201d Robbie stated.\n\nWith a sense of optimism, Steven Lubka, a managing director at Swan Bitcoin, perceived Robbie\u2019s comment as a positive for the crypto community.\n\nLubka told his 20,200 Twitter followers on July 29 that \u201cwe are so back.\u201c\n\nBarbie said we are all Ken's\n\n\n\nWe are so back \u2014 Steven Lubka (@DzambhalaHODL) July 29, 2023\n\nRobbie\u2019s comments on Bitcoin were brief and neutral, taking place as there are ongoing legal actions against celebrities who have recently promoted crypto.\n\nMost recently, NBA Miami Heat star Jimmy Butler sought to be removed from a $1 billion class-action lawsuit alleging the promotion of unregistered securities by cryptocurrency exchange Binance.\n\nIn a July 24 filing, Butler\u2019s lawyers argued that the tweets he appeared in did not promote the named securities, and, therefore, could not have helped promote them.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, as well as YouTubers Ben Armstrong (BitBoy Crypto) and Graham Stephan, are also challenging similar allegations in the same lawsuit.\n\nMagazine: Crypto winter can take a toll on hodlers\u2019 mental health"

        "title": "Bitcoin is in the summer doldrums. Here's what to expect in August. - CNBC",
        "content": "Chalk it up to the summer doldrums, perhaps, but for weeks nothing has been able to make the bitcoin price budge and investors may be in for more of the same in August. There's plenty to look forward to on the other side of the break, however. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is on pace to finish July down about 3.5%, according to Coin Metrics, after surging 12% in June. In the latest week, bitcoin closed lower by 1.9%. That was its fifth straight weekly decline and worst week since June 9. Coin Metrics measures a week in crypto, which trades 24 hours a day, from the 4:00 p.m. ET stock market close one Friday to the next. The third quarter that ends Sept. 30 is also, historically, the weakest for bitcoin. The average third-quarter gain going back to 2014 is just 4.67%, according to CoinGecko, and it's posted a positive third quarter in only four of the nine quarters since bitcoin's inception. \"August is a quiet month for traditional market investors and crypto is no different,\" said Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at NYDIG, the crypto subsidiary of Stone Ridge Asset Management. \"Historically, mean returns have waned as we go into the summer months and that may play out again in August.\" But even with the latest downdraft, bitcoin is still up about 77% for the year, and investors are upbeat. There's a good amount of potential upside for bitcoin thanks to the XRP ruling , legislation advancing in Congress, bitcoin ETF applications and the upcoming bitcoin halving in the spring of 2024. All that suggests bitcoin's price in six months \"is likely to be materially higher than it is today,\" according to Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals. More immediately, however, \"It's likely we're going to see more treading water over the next several weeks, simply because no news is likely to emerge,\" Edelman said. \"[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair] Gensler is not likely to change his public stance on crypto, the SEC is not likely to rule on the Bitcoin ETF applications, Congress is not likely to release major legislation. Yet all the signs toward those eventualities remain strong so everyone is in a waiting game and that will likely persist through the rest of the summer.\" The outlook was bright to start July: In June, BlackRock filed an application to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, injecting new hope into the market. That was shortly after the SEC brought two lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase , which most market participants hoped would help force some regulatory clarity, as well as the long-awaited XRP ruling. Even as trading volumes and liquidity remain stuck, the industry is ending the month on a high note as well, now that Congress after this week has four crypto bills heading to a full House vote for the first time: the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act and the Keep Your Coins Act. Continued interest rate increases by central banks, most recently the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank , are giving investors added reason to add to their bitcoin positions, Edelman said. Bitcoin traded in tandem with tech stocks for nearly all of last year, but its correlation with the Nasdaq broke down this year as it returned to its status as a noncorrelated asset. The Fed this week hiked interest rates a quarter percentage point to their highest level in more than 22 years. Although policymakers indicated at their June meeting that two more rate hikes were to be expected this year, the majority of the market is anticipating the Fed is finished tightening. \"As the markets continue to express uncertainty about whether or not there will be a recession or a correction in the stock market, investors are looking for ways they could hedge their diversified portfolios,\" Edelman said. \"Investors are unlikely to find bargains, meaning that there is more argument for significant increases coming than significant decreases,\" he added. \"There's not a lot of reason for worry that bitcoin prices might fall 20% or more. That argues for adding to your positions today.\" \u2014CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed reporting."

        "title": "From Accessibility to Adoption: How Bitcoin ATMs Simplify Access to Crypto - DailyCoin",
        "content": "When entering the crypto ecosystem, investors have a few available methods of buying crypto. Bitcoin ATMs have established themselves as a convenient and swift system for entering the crypto market, and their popularity ensures that their functionalities will not be easily replaced.\n\nHowever, as the Bitcoin ATM operators are looking for ways to expand operations, operating and upgrading the infrastructure remains a long-term objective to engage customers and offer benefits that other methods fall short of. Supporting the less tech-savvy newcomers provides a gateway to wider crypto adoption and shapes the future Bitcoin landscape.\n\nCan they be enhanced, resist the challenges, and keep up with the competition?\n\nWhat Are Bitcoin ATMs and How Do They Work?\n\nBitcoin ATMs have been instrumental in making smaller transactions more accessible and feasible. These devices provide a beginner-friendly and easy access point to digital assets, much like traditional cash ATMs. They allow users to buy or sell cryptocurrencies with cash or credit cards, and their interface is similar to conventional ATMs, providing clear and concise navigation instructions, often in more than one language.\n\nCurrently, there are two types of Bitcoin ATMs: unidirectional, which supports either buying or selling the cryptocurrency, and bidirectional, which supports both options. Users can easily buy their cryptocurrency or sell it for cash within seconds, making them a convenient method for getting instant cash.\n\nThe Rise Of Bitcoin ATMs: Market Trends and Statistics\n\nThe trend of Bitcoin ATMs started in 2013 when the first ever bidirectional crypto kiosk was manufactured by Robocoin and installed in Vancouver, Canada. After a quick palm security scan test, it allowed its customers to exchange Canadian dollars for digital currency and vice versa.\n\nThis event marked a milestone in Bitcoin adoption, and since then, the number of these machines has grown rapidly. According to coinatmradar.com data, there are currently 36.156 Bitcoin ATMs worldwide.\n\nThe United States ranks top globally with 30.621 Bitcoin ATMs, accounting for 84.7% of the global market.\n\nCanada, the home of the first ever Bitcoin ATM, now only accounts for 7.5% of the total ATMs globally.\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin ATM market has been affected by the crypto winter of 2022/23, with over 3,000 machines going offline in March 2023, representing a negative change of \u2013 6.6%. During the crypto winter, the market experiences chaos and unexpected fluctuations that can wipe out billions of dollars in investor value. To survive, most crypto companies aggressively cut costs and jobs. Although the number of Bitcoin ATMs globally has decreased, the net change has always remained positive, showing continuous growth. However, since February 2023, the number of closed ATMs exceeded new installations, resulting in a negative net growth of -2.6%, which continued throughout March. April, May, and June witnessed a revival as the ATM industry experienced a return to positive growth, ranging from 1% to 2%.\n\nThe decline in the number of open Bitcoin ATMs in spring was mainly attributed to the arrest of the management of Bitcoin of America, which operated roughly 2,500 locations across the US. Bitcoin of America\u2019s CEO now faces multiple charges for money laundering, conspiracy, and receiving stolen property. Although the charges against the company were only in Ohio for operating without proper licenses, reports from users suggest that locations across the country were also affected and closed, as reflected in the current statistics.\n\nDespite the global short-term decline in installations, there was some positive news from Australia on the Bitcoin ATM front. Roy Morgan\u2019s Research Institute reports that over 1 million Australians own cryptocurrency. In contrast to other regions, such as Europe and the United States, Australia has been steadily increasing the number of Bitcoin ATMs, surpassing Asia with 549 machines in July 2023.\n\nThough there are challenges, the rise of Bitcoin ATMs globally shows a continued growth in adoption and a growing interest in cryptocurrency.\n\nBenefits Of Using Bitcoin ATMs: A Comparison with Traditional Crypto Exchanges\n\nAccording to a recent study by TripleA, a company acting as a crypto payment gateway, 82% of U.S. cryptocurrency owners are aged between 18-44, with only 7% being 55 or older. This indicates that younger Americans largely own cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency demographics also appear to be very similar for other continents and countries.\n\nThis is likely due to younger people being more tech-savvy and more comfortable with the early adoption of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies. Older generations may be more comfortable investing in traditional asset classes like stocks, bonds, and real estate, which have been around for much longer and are more established.\n\nBitcoin ATMs can provide an easy on-ramp for less tech-savvy and more mature customers by simplifying the buying process and increasing accessibility. Some of the benefits are:\n\nFirstly, they represent the only physical access point for digital assets. Older and more traditional generations may be uncomfortable using complex technology like cryptocurrency exchanges. Bitcoin ATMs provide a familiar and accessible interface similar to traditional ATMs, acting as a bridge between physical FIAT money and Bitcoin. Often installed and located in public places, these machines are more accessible to older customers who might not be familiar with centralized exchanges. The Coin ATM Radar website provides a convenient way to find Bitcoin ATMs located nearby through geolocation detection.\n\nThese generations are also more likely to prefer cash payments in their everyday transactions; providing them with an option of directly exchanging cash for cryptocurrency could simplify the process of accessing the cryptocurrency market.\n\nNew users, beginners, and the less tech-savvy will presumably start with smaller transactions as they enter the new and unknown industry with caution. Bitcoin ATMs provide a convenient method for making smaller transactions, offering valuable insights and experience needed to gain more confidence in the cryptocurrency in the future. These smaller transactions are often processed instantly with little to no registration requirements or limitations. Many of these machines also offer the option to scan a customer\u2019s wallet for instant transfers or will generate a new wallet for a customer if they do not currently own one. This facilitates the transaction process and ensures a smooth experience. As users gain more experience and confidence in the cryptocurrency market, they can gradually start making larger investments to diversify their portfolios. Unlike traditional crypto exchanges, Bitcoin ATMs offer a simple and accessible way to enter the market and make smaller transactions, including buying Bitcoin.\n\nAside from being secure and regulated, these services offer beginner-friendly support through 24/7 customer service and step-by-step instructions and guidance on setting up a Bitcoin wallet, scanning the QR code, or answering any questions or concerns that might arise from the process of obtaining the cryptocurrency.\n\nBanking the unbanked is often hailed as one of many benefits of Bitcoin. Bitcoin ATMs contribute to this principle by allowing users without a bank account to access cryptocurrency. It certainly provides financial freedom for many individuals who live in areas without proper bank access or who do not have the requirements to open and possess a bank account. It benefits those who, for various reasons, avoid banks and prefer staying off the grid.\n\nMany users avoid centralized exchanges due to their reputation for being custodial and their complex account setup process. To comply with regulatory requirements, the majority of these exchanges require KYC documentation \u2013 Know Your Customer policy, where users are asked to scan and provide their personal documents as a way of identity verification. Unfortunately, these institutions are a single point of failure and have been frequent targets for hackers and theft. Many privacy-concerned experts warn of the risks of providing sensitive personal documentation to third parties. Mt. Gox, Equifax data breach, and KuCoin are just a few of the hacks that happened, resulting in thousands of bitcoins stolen and the personal data of millions exposed. A great deal of Bitcoin ATMs will not require registration up to a certain amount, and no account is necessary.\n\nFinally, smaller transactions done via Bitcoin ATMs carry a smaller risk for investors than larger transactions. During volatile and unfavorable market conditions, investors may be hesitant to invest large sums of money into Bitcoin but are also more willing to invest small amounts. Market analysis data shows that smaller bitcoin wallets, so-called shrimps, continued trading and remained very active during the worst days of crypto winter in December 2022.\n\nA Few Important Points to Remember When Using a Bitcoin ATM\n\nBitcoin ATMs are generally secure, using encrypted protocols to protect users\u2019 transactions and personal information. Most Bitcoin ATM operators comply with strict regulations and security measures.\n\nHowever, much like handling cash and using traditional ATMs, users should take precautionary measures to ensure their safety. Avoid using them in poorly lit or isolated areas and using ATMs by unfamiliar operators. Also, always be aware of your surroundings.\n\n\n\nIf a Bitcoin ATM is used to create a paper wallet, it will provide a customer with a private key needed to access the Bitcoin on the blockchain. Private keys must be stored in a safe and secure place, as anyone with access to a private key can access the Bitcoin in a wallet. Maintaining the same level of caution as with a debit card PIN when handling crypto wallet private keys is crucial. Leaving the Bitcoin in the paper wallet provided by the Bitcoin ATM is not recommended. Using a secure wallet and transferring the funds to that wallet is a much safer and recommended practice.\n\n\n\nWhen choosing a wallet, make sure it is a noncustodial open-source wallet that supports Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is a blockchain, and transactions on a blockchain are immutable. Unlike wire transfers, where erroneous and mistaken payments can be canceled, BTC transactions cannot be canceled or reversed. Therefore, checking the transaction details is vital. If the incorrect BTC address is entered, there will be no option to reverse the transaction.\n\n\n\nTransaction fees on Bitcoin ATMs can vary from country to country, with the most frequent being between 10% and 15%. Additionally, there are different fees for buying and selling crypto on Bitcoin ATMs, so check the commission rates before trading. You can find a comprehensive list of all Bitcoin ATM locations with fees included for most of them at the Coin ATM radar website.\n\n\n\nSome Bitcoin machine operators also charge a fixed fee on top of their commission fee. All notifications should be displayed on the Bitcoin ATM before making a transaction. Remember that transaction fees are often higher than those charged by central exchanges, as users also pay for convenience and additional costs related to operating a Bitcoin ATM.\n\n\n\nDo not panic if the Bitcoin you bought does not show in your wallet hours after you complete a purchase at the Bitcoin ATM. The transaction will appear for some wallets the moment a purchase is made or within a minute a transaction is broadcast, but it will be marked as \u201cpending\u201d until there has been at least one network confirmation. This is how the blockchain works; each new block will also confirm a previous one. When a transaction is confirmed, it is included in a block by a miner. The time it takes a transaction to be confirmed depends on the fee used by the sender and the overall network traffic. Sometimes this can take up to two or three hours, but there is no reason for panic. Most wallets are integrated with blockchain explorer, so pending transactions can be tracked in real-time.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, each Bitcoin ATM will issue a ticket containing transaction details, including a transaction ID (TX ID), which you can use to contact a customer service center.\n\nOverall, using a Bitcoin ATM can be a convenient way to buy or sell Bitcoin, but it is important to be aware of the potential risks and take appropriate precautions.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin ATMs: Trends and Innovations to Watch\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is constantly evolving, and the Bitcoin ATM industry is no exception. Flexibility and adaptability are essential to keep up with the rapid pace of change. Taking into account the latest turn of events, especially the last two months, it is clear that several trends and innovations should be on the horizon:\n\nRegulatory certainty is crucial to increasing customer trust in the crypto industry as a whole, as well as the Bitcoin ATM industry in particular. Recent charges against the company, Bitcoin of America, have negatively affected Bitcoin ATM industry statistics. Clear regulations would increase customer security and enhance the overall safety of Bitcoin users.\n\nThere is a need for improvements in Bitcoin ATM operations. Currently, only 23.2% of all worldwide Bitcoin ATMs are bidirectional, allowing both buying and selling crypto. A staggering 27.768 machines are still buy-only, making up 76.8% of the overall Bitcoin ATMs available. As the crypto market is becoming more dynamic and one of its main advantages is its transaction speed, unidirectional ATMs decrease cryptocurrency utility, speed, convenience, and profitability. Subsequently, they result in more time-consuming processes, cause financial losses, and fail to attract more customers to the crypto ecosystem.\n\nIntegration of new cryptocurrencies is also an important trend to watch. Many Bitcoin ATMs now support other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Litecoin, and this trend should continue.\n\nAnother key trend to keep in mind is support for the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Currently, only 254 Bitcoin ATMs support transactions on the Lightning Network, which is around 0.7% of all available Bitcoin ATMs at the moment. Given the fact that the Lightning Network is designed specifically for smaller transactions, reducing the cost and increasing the transaction speed, there is a lot of room for improvement here. Bitcoin adoption could benefit greatly from the Bitcoin Lightning Network, yet many newcomers are confused about how to transfer BTC to Bitcoin Lightning Network wallets. Incorporating the option to change cash to the Lightning Bitcoin immediately on a Bitcoin ATM would facilitate the process of getting familiar with both layer networks. This improvement would benefit the senior generation and younger crypto enthusiasts who are still apprehensive about using the Lightning Network.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin ATMs have revolutionized the way people invest in cryptocurrencies. They offer a convenient and accessible way for users to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, providing greater privacy and security than traditional exchanges. They also promote inclusion and reduce the age gap, making new and revolutionary technology such as Bitcoin available to the traditional retail customer.\n\nBitcoin ATMs can contribute to and promote the widespread adoption of Bitcoin and provide and facilitate on-ramp access. Aside from that, they provide a great place for investors looking to get involved in cryptocurrencies as they familiarize themselves and gradually start making bolder decisions.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that there is a growing trend toward mobile apps and online platforms that allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly from their smartphones. While this is convenient, it still poses risks and obstacles for cash users and older generations who may lack information on debit cards and in-app purchases.\n\nEurope is lagging behind America in the number of installed Bitcoin machines (with only 1,465 machines), and no European operators are in the top 10 list of Bitcoin ATM operators. However, with the adoption of the MICAR regulation and more regulatory clarity, Europe is expected to become a more competitive player in the Bitcoin ATM market.\n\nCertain modifications and adjustments will be necessary. Rapid growth and development of the crypto industry will bring challenges and obstacles, which, to thrive further, must be overcome with innovations and valid responses. The Lightning Network adoption and a wider choice of assets are a good starting point for unlocking the full potential of Bitcoin ATMs."

Speaking at Consensus 2023, Ethan Vera, COO at mining services company Luxor Technologies, said that more equipment is entering Russia than any other country in the globe.\n\nAs China's mining industry was outlawed in 2021, Russia's mining market share increased, making it the second- or third-largest in the world.\n\nThere are no restrictions on Russia that entirely forbid participation in the mining industry, despite the fact that international sanctions were put in place as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and ongoing attacks on the nation.\n\nRussian miners have been encouraged to expand their operations by better mining economics, reduced regulatory oversight and taxes compared to the US and other countries, and low energy costs.\n\nDue to these factors, it will be the only nation that can significantly speed up the rise of hashrate, according to a report by mining company Cryptocurrency Mining Group (CMG)."

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThe beginning of the week saw the underwhelming launch of Worldcoin Protocol, along with its native cryptocurrency, WLD.\n\nWorldcoin is co-founded by Open AI CEO Sam Altman and the premise is at once utopian and dystopian: anyone wanting some WLD has to visit an \u201dOrb\u201d\u2014these can currently be found in Berlin, Dubai, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, San Francisco, Seoul, and Tokyo\u2014 and get a snapshot of their eyeballs taken.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis biometric data is used alongside verification of their government-issued ID to confirm someone\u2019s personhood before distributing a set number of coins to them.\n\nWorldcoin believes it\u2019s building the infrastructure to bank the world\u2019s unbanked, enabling everyone \u201cto broadly share the coming technological prosperity \u201d says its website. but many are skeptical, including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin who listed \u201cmajor issues\u201d of privacy, accessibility, centralization and security and said it could take years for the protocol to work.\n\nBritish privacy watchdog the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) agrees, at least on privacy and security concerns and told Decrypt that it \"[the organization notes] the launch of Worldcoin in the U.K. and will be making enquiries.\"\n\nWLD currently trades for $2.30, about 30% down from its high on launch day of $3.30, according to crypto data aggregator CoinGecko.\n\nThe market leaders\n\nIt was the fifth consecutive week of underwhelming price performance for market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) lost 1.7% and now starts the weekend at $29,291, while Ethereum (ETH) lost 0.9% and changes hands at $1,872.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe market leaders had a pretty static week overall and their prices haven\u2019t moved much since Monday. This week\u2019s news that the Fed was hiking interest rates yet again did not immediately move the leading coins.\n\nLast year, the U.S. central bank hiked interest rates by 75 basis points four times and finished the year with a 50 basis point hike. This year there have so far been two hikes\u2014including Wednesday\u2019s\u2014of only 25 basis points each, but interest rates are now the highest they\u2019ve been for 22 years.\n\nXRP\u2019s recent growth spurt, which was prompted by a small but significant courtroom victory against the SEC a fortnight ago, appears to have settled. Ripple\u2019s cryptocurrency\u2014which is definitely not a security\u2014is down 7.7% for the week and currently trades at $0.70786.\n\nThe only other notable price movement this week came from Toncoin (TON), which fell almost 15% this week to trade at $1.24 at the time of writing.\n\nCrypto politics in Russia, Korea and the U.S.\n\nOn Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a bill granting legal tender to a digital ruble, the issuance of which will be overseen by the country\u2019s central bank\u2014although officials say it could take years before the central bank digital currency (CBDC) is widely adopted.\n\nOn Wednesday, South Korea rolled out a new interagency investigation unit to tackle crypto crime and take a leading role in investor protection before regulations are implemented.\n\nOperating from the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors\u2019 Office, The Joint Investigation Centre for Crypto Crimes will consist of 30 investigators drawn from several government agencies and bodies, including the prosecutor's office, the Financial Supervisory Service, the National Tax Service, and the Korea Customs Service.\n\nThat day, over in the states, Democrats and Republicans locked horns over the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT) for the 21st Century Act. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services committee, assailed the bill as a \u201cwish list\u201d for the crypto industry, and said it undermined the role of the SEC and existing legislation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats also accused the bill of having weak consumer protections, though this point was parried by Republicans like Committee chairman Patrick McHenry (R-NC), who argued that, while not perfect, the bill is \u201cbetter at worst case\u201d than the current regulatory regime.\n\nThe Committee members also debated a stablecoin bill called the \u201cClarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023.\u201d Democrats accuse Republicans of rushing to pass the bill, and Waters said the proposed legislation lacks clarity over the reserves underpinning stablecoins that are pegged to the U.S. dollar."

I\u2019d be buying silver, gold, Bitcoin and Ethereum. That\u2019d be my portfolio,\u201d he said in allusion to someone investing $100,000. For those with lower risk tolerance, he recommended allocating only 30% of a portfolio in the example, with the remaining 70% in bonds and perhaps index funds.\n\nNovogratz\u2019s bullish stance on Bitcoin received a boost from BlackRock's application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in June. In his opinion, the application was the biggest Bitcoin development of 2023.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing that happened this year in Bitcoin is Larry Fink.\u201d\n\nRelated: Grayscale urges SEC to approve all Bitcoin ETFs simultaneously\n\nFink, the billionaire CEO of BlackRock, was initially a \u201cnonbeliever,\u201d Novogratz said.\n\n\u201cNow he says, \u2018Hey, this is going to be a global currency.

Orange pill is when you take a nonbeliever, and you make them a believer in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBlackRock's push into Bitcoin is part of an adoption cycle, according to Novogratz, which could lead the price of Bitcoin to reach new highs, especially if the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates.\n\nAlso commenting on the recent decision in Ripple's case vs. the Securities and Exchange Commission, in which Ripple\u2019s XRP (XRP) token has been partially classified as a security, Novogratz stated that the decision was a victory for the crypto industry as it proves that \u201cthe rules are nothing close to clear.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Should you \u2018orange pill\u2019 children?

Upwards of $100 million worth of cryptocurrency are at risk due to a \u201cre-entrancy\u201d bug in Vyper, a programming language used to power parts of the Curve system. Several stablecoin pools on the platform \u2014 used for pricing and liquidity on a number of different DeFi services \u2014 have been drained by hackers so far. Other projects that use the Vyper programming language could share the same vulnerability. As Asia opened its trading day, it was unclear how much had been drained from Curve as a result of the attack. BlockSec, a blockchain auditing firm, estimated the total losses above $42 million in a preliminary analysis posted to Twitter. Curve's CRV token was recently trading at 62 cents, off more than 16% over the past 24 hours. It changed hands as low as 59 cents, a more than 19% decline late Sunday after the breach."

It\u2019s worth noting that Fink was initially skeptical about Bitcoin\u2019s merits before becoming an advocate for the digital currency.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing that happened this year in Bitcoin is Larry Fink. <\u2026> He got \u2018orange-pilled,\u2019 as we say. Orange pill is when you take a nonbeliever, and you make them a believer in Bitcoin. <\u2026.> Larry was a nonbeliever. Now he says, \u2018Hey, this is going to be a global currency.\u2019 People around the world all trust it,\u201d Novogratz said.\n\nImpact of BlackRock on Bitcoin price\n\nAccording to Novogratz, BlackRock\u2019s strong drive towards a spot Bitcoin Exchnage Traded Fund (ETF) and Fink\u2019s changing perspective form a crucial \u201cadoption cycle\u201d that could propel Bitcoin to attain another record high.\n\nPart of Fink\u2019s skepticism was captured in a Finbold report that indicated that back in 2018, the executive had stated that clients had \u2018zero interest\u2019 in cryptocurrencies. At the time, he pointed out that the company will only be interested in cryptocurrencies once established structures are in place.\n\nHowever, the U.S. is yet to enact comprehensive regulations to manage the crypto sector, and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has faced criticism for allegedly attempting to stifle the industry.\n\nThe endorsement from Fink and his influence within the financial industry is seen as substantial validation of Bitcoin\u2019s position as a legitimate and increasingly mainstream asset. Notably, the crypto market and Bitcoin received a reprieve, recording significant short-term gains following the BlackRock ETF filing.\n\nCurrently, attention has turned to the SEC to see if they will approve the ETF. A previous Finbold report revealed that the asset management firm has a good track record with the regulator.\n\nOn the other hand, Novogratz remains a Bitcoin bull, banking on the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential future growth. For instance, the investor has stated that investing in cryptocurrencies can be considered a smart move, especially given the prevailing economic conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin continues to trade below $30,000 while attempting to avoid further decline. By press time, Bitcoin was valued at $28,287.\n\nRead more crypto news."
