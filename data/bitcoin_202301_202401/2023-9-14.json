        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best blockchain and bitcoin ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on the blockchain industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, there are over 1.8 million cryptocurrencies in the world, with a market capitalization of $1.04 trillion as of September 2023. The market cap of cryptocurrencies reached an all-time high of $2.9 trillion in November 2021. Currently, there are 670 cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide where digital currencies are actively traded. Cryptocurrencies primarily rely upon blockchain technology to record transactions in a decentralized and secure manner. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most dominant cryptocurrencies in the world, accounting for over 67% of the global cryptocurrency market capitalization. Both of these cryptocurrencies heavily depend on blockchain technology, which enables consensus, security, and the decentralized distribution of these digital assets. Notably, blockchain technology's application extends beyond cryptocurrency and finds utility in various sectors, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and identity verification. Popular companies like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) also have exposure to the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe Impact of Rising Interest Rates on Bitcoin\n\nIn the last year, the US Federal Reserve has increased the benchmark interest rates on seven occasions from 3.125% to 5.375% at midpoint. The most recent interest rate hike took place on July 27, and the Federal Reserve continues to express the possibility of further rate increases as a measure to control inflation, aiming to achieve its 2% target. The US consumer price index (CPI) for the month of July 2023 was recorded at 3.2%, and analysts anticipate the CPI to increase to 3.6% for August 2023. The CPI reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, following which the Federal Reserve accelerated the pace of interest rate hikes. It is widely believed that rising interest rates are likely to hurt Bitcoin prices. However, recent market dynamics have contradicted this viewpoint. In the last year, despite the significant interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks globally, the price of Bitcoin has observed a surge of 18.5%. Bitcoin emerged as one of the best-performing asset classes as it outperformed the 12.2% increase observed by the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Furthermore, Bitcoin even outperformed gold prices, which are traditionally considered a safe-haven asset during periods of rising inflation. Gold experienced a more modest increase of 15.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nEvolving Crypto Investment Landscape\n\nFollowing the debut of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:BITO) in October 2021, numerous Blockchain and Bitcoin funds have entered the market. Global X, a New York-based ETF provider, has been particularly active in this space, introducing three ETFs related to blockchain, with the Global X Blockchain ETF (NASDAQ:BKCH) being one of its most recognized products. Numerous retail investors have expressed interest in identifying the best crypto ETF offered by Vanguard, a prominent investment advisor based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, with an asset under management (AUM) of $7.7 trillion. While Vanguard does not offer a dedicated ETF exclusively focused on Blockchain and Bitcoin, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) serves as one of the largest and most widely recognized Bitcoin investment funds, with a market value of $3.28 billion. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is an investment trust that charges an annual fee of 2% to cover insurance, management, and storage expenses. It holds actual Bitcoins on behalf of investors. Each share represents a fractional ownership interest in the trust's Bitcoin holdings. The investment fund enables investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without having to directly hold or manage Bitcoins. It must be noted that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust trades over-the-counter (OTC) as an unregistered security, so it can only be purchased through brokers.

For ETFs with a shorter history, we have looked at their performance since inception. While some of these ETFs have generated negative returns over the past 5 years, they have posted strong positive YTD returns, indicating their potential to offer healthy returns for investors in the future. These ETFs provide exposure to the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors through various approaches, such as investing in Bitcoin futures or in companies with a strong connection to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.\n\nBest Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs\n\n10. VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (CBOE:XBTF)\n\n5-Year Price Performance: -58.2%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $41.95 million\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.76%\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (CBOE:XBTF) invests in Bitcoin futures contracts and aims to provide exposure to Bitcoin price movements without needing to own the cryptocurrency. The ETF invests primarily in Bitcoin futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) using a passive, index-tracking strategy. It does not invest in Bitcoin directly or hold it, unlike the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (OTC:GBTC). Although the ETF has been in the red over the last 5 years, it has yielded a YTD return of 51.84% as of September 14.\n\n9. AdvisorShares Managed Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:CRYP)\n\nPrice Performance since Inception: -35.8%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $402,060\n\nExpense Ratio: 1.59%\n\nAdvisorShares Managed Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:CRYP) is an actively managed ETF that invests in Bitcoin futures contracts and money market funds. Like VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (CBOE:XBTF), the ETF does not invest directly in Bitcoin but provides exposure to Bitcoin price movements through futures. The ETF is managed by AdvisorShares Investments, which is a thematic ETF issuer. As an active ETF, the manager can shift holdings, attempting to optimize returns rather than passively tracking an index. Due to its active management approach and specialized nature, the fund has a high expense ratio. The ETF has generated a YTD return of 29.25% as of September 14.\n\n8. Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF (NASDAQ:FDIG)\n\nPrice Performance since Inception: -24.0%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $43.04 million\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.39%\n\nFidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF (NASDAQ:FDIG) is an actively managed ETF that invests in companies engaged in cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and digital payments. The four biggest holdings of the ETF are Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA), Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) and CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK). Together, these four stocks have a combined weightage of over 43.2%. As an active ETF, Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF (NASDAQ:FDIG) can shift allocations seeking to optimize exposure to the crypto/blockchain segment. The ETF does not invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies directly; instead, it focuses on equities. The ETF's YTD return stands at 66.17% as of September 14.\n\n7. Siren NASDAQ NexGen Economy ETF (NASDAQ:BLCN)\n\n5-Year Price Performance: -12.5%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $68.74 million\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.68%\n\nSiren NASDAQ NexGen Economy ETF (NASDAQ:BLCN) invests in companies focused on blockchain, Bitcoin, and quantum computing technologies. It is at the seventh place on our list of the 10 best blockchain and bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe ETF\u2019s holdings include cryptocurrency miners, exchanges, and service providers, as well as quantum computing and semiconductor companies. The ETF tracks the Indxx Blockchain Index, which contains companies involved in the nascent blockchain economy and provides exposure to emerging blockchain and cryptocurrency companies. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd, and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) are the top four holdings of the ETF, representing 19% of the portfolio.\n\nHere's what Wedgewood Partners said about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was the leading detractor from performance during the quarter. Total payment volume grew +12% (foreign exchange neutral) while revenues grew +10% (FX-neutral) and adjusted operating earnings grew +19%. E-commerce industry sales trends have normalized back to their pre-pandemic trend of growth, with high-margin branded payments keeping track with the industry. Despite this, investors were concerned PayPal\u2019s fast growing, private label payments solutions will dilute Company returns. However, payments are a very scalable business, and we expect the Company will be able to manage both private label and branded to achieve attractive returns and double-digit growth. Although multiples in the payment industry have compressed, especially after the multi-year process of being added to the financial sector, PayPal\u2019s businesses are substantially different enough from traditional spread-based businesses, in addition to having much more compelling growth drivers, that PayPal\u2019s well-below market multiple should revert to its higher, historical average.\u201d\n\n6. ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW)\n\n5-Year Price Performance: 1.7%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $1.37 billion\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.88%\n\nARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW) is the oldest and the biggest ETF on our list of the best blockchain and bitcoin ETFs in terms of net assets.\n\nThe actively managed ETF is focused on companies expected to benefit from next-gen internet technologies, including blockchain and cryptocurrency. ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW) is managed by Cathie Wood-led ARK Investment Management. The St. Petersburg, Florida-based asset management firm is known for identifying and investing in disruptive technologies. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) are two notable top holdings of the fund, representing over 14.8% of the ETF's portfolio.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs.

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Cash Reach $1,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The Bitcoin Cash (BCH 2.27%) cryptocurrency bills itself as a system of \"peer-to-peer electronic cash.\"\n\nThat vision carries subtle but important differences from Bitcoin, where the battle cry is \"a new kind of money.\" Bitcoin offers payment services but mainly wants to store and protect your wealth in the long run. Bitcoin Cash started from the same code base but tweaked a few parameters to speed up its transaction processing. So Bitcoin wants to be a solid tool for generic money management. Bitcoin Cash serves as a nimbler payment processor, with less long-term stability and a potentially weaker data security model.\n\nWith this transaction-friendly focus, it should come as no surprise that Bitcoin Cash is more volatile than Bitcoin. For instance, the smaller and swifter cryptocurrency has doubled its price in 2023 while Bitcoin gained 55%. At the same time, the current price of $199 per Bitcoin Cash token is far from the three-year high of $1,547.\n\nIs the recent price surge a sign of better times ahead, or is the slumping long-term trend a more accurate predictor? Will Bitcoin Cash ever be worth $1,000 per token again?\n\nWhat's new?\n\nBitcoin Cash creates value when people use it in the real world, or take steps toward widespread use of its payment services. The cryptocurrency has indeed seen some good news recently.\n\nA consortium of financial service giants, led by Charles Schwab and Fidelity , fired up a brand new cryptocurrency exchange in June. The EDX Markets exchange launched with support for four hand-picked cryptocurrencies, and this elite list includes Bitcoin Cash. As a result, Bitcoin Cash's token price nearly tripled in a week as investors digested this strong vote of confidence.\n\nand , fired up a brand new cryptocurrency exchange in June. The EDX Markets exchange launched with support for four hand-picked cryptocurrencies, and this elite list includes Bitcoin Cash. As a result, Bitcoin Cash's token price nearly tripled in a week as investors digested this strong vote of confidence. Recent rulings in a couple of important lawsuits imply that Bitcoin Cash should be seen as a cash-like commodity rather than a regulation-laden security. Nothing is set in stone yet, and the legal wheels of appeals and jury trials will probably keep turning for years before the regulatory framework is finalized. But baby steps in the right direction still count as moving forward.\n\nThe crawl toward a more stable crypto-trading future has inspired several investment management titans to consider making Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available on the open market. The list of potential ETF issuers is a who's who of investment services. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest has a filing in play. BlackRock is the world's largest financial manager with $9 trillion of assets on the books, and another current Bitcoin ETF application. If the SEC ever approves one of these filings, the floodgates will open for all sorts of cryptocurrency ETFs -- including Bitcoin Cash. That potential sea change is important because the funds would pour massive amounts of cold, hard cash into the crypto sector.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nA couple of thorny questions must work out in Bitcoin Cash's favor before the cryptocurrency can soar to $1,000 per token again.\n\nFirst, the progress toward a serious legal and regulatory crypto system must continue. Stalling out for years could bring Bitcoin Cash back to square one in many ways. Second, crypto-based payments need to become more common. Third, it would be great if Bitcoin Cash could become the most popular blockchain platform for high-speed payment transactions, though simply landing among a handful of standard options could be good enough.\n\nCan these crucial chips fall the right way? Yes, of course. But there is no guarantee that they will -- and even if they do, Bitcoin Cash may not survive a long and slow process. This cryptocurrency has market momentum on its side right now. It would be a shame to waste it.\n\nBitcoin Cash is making progress, but this digital coin is still far from the go-to solution for digital payments. Bitcoin remains the most widely accepted crypto payment option in the real world, followed by Ethereum and Litecoin. If you're dealing with international payments, XRP also enters the conversation before Bitcoin Cash. Maybe that's good enough to jam a foot in the market door for the long haul, and maybe it isn't. Time will tell.\n\nSo Bitcoin Cash might be able to regain the lofty $1,000 price point again, but that target looks distant today. You should buckle down for a bumpy ride, keep the investment size modest due to the substantial risks along the way, and be prepared to lose it all if something goes wrong. It's a high-risk, high-reward situation. Make sure you can live with that before putting real money into Bitcoin Cash."

He references a headline from Barron\u2019s that highlights the disparity between people\u2019s perception of the economy and the objective data.\n\nPechman delves into the concept of excess savings, agreeing with Barron\u2019s that a significant portion of the United States population lacks sufficient savings for retirement, potentially necessitating longer working years. He notes that household wealth in the U.S. has reached new heights, primarily due to surges in equities and real estate assets.\n\nShifting his focus, Pechman discusses rising concerns among U.S. consumers about increasing prices, particularly the cost of filling up their vehicles with gasoline. He connects this to the recent surge in U.S. crude futures, influenced by Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to extend output curbs.\n\nPechman foresees challenges for President Joe Biden, especially in managing inflation and the impact of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes on real estate and the S&P 500. He then addresses the implications for Bitcoin (BTC), suggesting that if inflation outpaces income growth, it could exert downward pressure on the cryptocurrency.\n\nMoving on to the U.S. budget issue, Pechman explores the possibility of a government shutdown due to disagreements in Congress. In a critical analysis, Pechman questions the use of disaster funds to cover war expenses, drawing attention to the Biden administration\u2019s priorities. He emphasizes the potential consequences and legality of such maneuvers.\n\nPechman concludes by suggesting that a U.S. government shutdown could trigger a bull run in Bitcoin and advises keeping an eye on this potential trigger for a cryptocurrency rally in early October.\n\nCheck out the latest episode of Macro Markets, available exclusively on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel."

This only brought temporary relief for investors, considering that the SEC delayed the decision on several such ETF applications, including the ones from BlackRock and WisdomTree.\n\nTwo days after the news, Bitcoin recovered to US$26,529 on Thursday, which could pave the way to more upside momentum in September, according to Kadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing sentiment that Bitcoin could rally back above US$30,000 in the coming month,\u201d wrote Stadelmann.\n\nHowever, Ferrari expects Bitcoin\u2019s recovery to be short-lived.\n\n\u201cThe recent rebound in Bitcoin\u2019s price has set the stage for a temporary bounce in price, likely to the US$28,000 level. That will likely be short-lived, however, as Bitcoin is likely to experience further downward pressure in the coming months,\u201d wrote Ferrari.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, the release of the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) showed that inflation posted its biggest monthly increase this year, rising 0.6% for August and 3.7% from a year ago.\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nNotable movers: BCH, RUNE\n\nBitcoin Cash was this week\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 100, rising 13.23% to US$217.14. The token started picking up pace on Tuesday as the wider crypto investor sentiment was improved by the launch of Standard Chartered\u2019s crypto custody wing.\n\nRune, the native governance token of the ThorChain network, was this week\u2019s second-biggest gainer, rising 11.53% to US$1.75. The coin started picking up momentum on Wednesday and has been receiving increased investor interest since lending went live on the protocol on Aug. 21.\n\nSee related article: Grayscale wins against SEC as India moves on blockchain; Friend.tech loses friends\n\nNext Week: Can Bitcoin reclaim US$30,000 in September?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s double-bottom technical formation, which printed its first leg down on June 15 and the second one this week, is a bullish sign for the short term, according to Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App.\n\n\u201cWhile Bitcoin is likely to trade lower in the coming months, the double bottom signals a short-term bullish trend for Bitcoin. If Bitcoin manage to close the week above the resistance of approximately US$25,000, it signals strong short-term support,\u201d wrote Kiely, adding that Bitcoin could see considerable bullish momentum if it returned to US$30,000 in September.\n\nIn the macroeconomy, investors will be looking forward to the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest rate decision on Wednesday. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 97% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, up from 92% one week ago. It gives a 67.2% chance for another pause in November.\n\nSee related article:India\u2019s G20 Presidency, Blockchain Week & Singapore\u2019s new President"

        "title": "Can New Bitcoin BSC Coin Repeat the Bitcoin Price Move from $1 to $30,000 And Mint More Millionaires? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "NEW YORK, Sept. 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ \u2014 If you had bought $100 of Bitcoin in 2011, it would have been worth $3m when BTC was trading at $30,000 earlier this year \u2013 could Bitcoin BSC ($BTCBSC \u2013 bitcoinbsc.io) repeat that feat?\n\nCrypto investors certainly think so, which explains why the 'Bitcoin on BNB Smart Chain' staking crypto asset has raised more than $2 million in less than two weeks as its presale races toward the finish line of $3.96 million.\n\nBitcoin BSC could turn $100 into $1 million like the original Bitcoin, but it is selling fast \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can buy it now at the Bitcoin 2011 price of $0.99 (Bitcoin BSC)\n\nCurrently priced at just $0.99 in presale \u2013 roughly the price Bitcoin was at in 2011 \u2013 Bitcoin BSC has a much better risk-reward profile for potential investors than Bitcoin, not to mention the staking yield that generates an income stream to buttress capital returns.\n\nTo be sure not to miss out on the presale alpha opportunities and the listing, which could be next week, follow the project's X (formerly Twitter) account and join the Telegram group.\n\nBitcoin is in good shape \u2013 and Bitcoin BSC will be a top beneficiary\n\nBehind the headlines about 'crypto winter' which followed failing crypto banks and exchanges, Bitcoin is actually looking in pretty good shape, and so are the Bitcoin derivative and clone coins that seek to provide a value differential over the original offering.\n\nBitcoin BSC, like Bitcoin, has a total supply of 21 million tokens. However, unlike Bitcoin, it runs on a proof-of-stake network, the BNB Smart Chain, which is a cheaper and more efficient blockchain.\n\nThe latest Bitcoin alternative coin has something else going for it that Bitcoin doesn't \u2013 staking built in by design.\n\nIf you buy Bitcoin BSC today with BNB, you can start staking and earning yield. Token buyers have jumped at the chance to start locking in passive income. So over 1,000,000 $BTCBSC has been staked and is currently earning an annual percentage yield (APY) of 268%.\n\nThe current staked tokens amounts to almost half of the total number of sold $BTCBSC to date.\n\nOften when you see an APY in triple figures, it can ring alarm bells given the huge spread it represents over the current interest rate levels in the advanced economies, which are in single figures.\n\nStory continues\n\nEverything is transparent with Bitcoin BSC, which means you can keep tabs on how many token holders are staking by visiting the real-time Bitcoin BSC staking dashboard.\n\nIn addition, the project's smart contracts are audited, and a guarantee of locked liquidity has been provided by the team for when it is listed on the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX).\n\nBitcoin BSC staking is built on solid foundations and is open now\n\nWith $BTCBSC, there is no impenetrable and opaque algorithm-based financial engineering built on rickety foundations like Terra Luna. Instead, Bitcoin BSC has allocated 69% of token supply to be paid out in rewards to stakers.\n\nThe pre-mined $BTCBSC tokens are emitted at a rate of 0.25 $BTCBSC per block in a block production schedule that mimics Bitcoin by rolling time back to 2011.\n\n$BTCBSC rewards are paid out every 10 minutes in a similar fashion to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBitcoin BSC is part of a new wave of derivative clone coins into the bitcoin space, drawing on the version 2.0 theme but, in this case, also leveraging the utility of staking.\n\nThese staking-based bitcoin clone coins come to market with the added security of buyers knowing that they come with a sizeable portion of the token-holding community already committed to the project through their deposits into its staking smart contract.\n\nThis means when the token launches on decentralized exchanges, there will be far less selling pressure due to the yield-bearing presence of staking at the heart of its tokenomics.\n\nStaked coins have a seven-day withdrawal lock, after which tokens can be taken off stake at any time. Those who initiate stakes after $BTCBSC is listed will be able to stake their tokens regardless of whether they have bought with BNB or ETH. But if you wish to initiate staking while the presale is still in progress, then you must purchase with BNB.\n\nBitcoin BSC is not just another Bitcoin clone or meme coin 'version 2' imitator\n\nStaking makes offerings like Bitcoin BSC far superior to the utility-light meme coin version 2 clones such as Pepe 2.0, Dogecoin 2.0, Shiba Inu 2.0, or even the likes of Bitcoin 2.0, whose only resemblance to bitcoin was in the name of the token.\n\nThen there are coins such as HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu (HPOS10I) that uses the ticker BITCOIN on DEXs \u2013 although most centralized exchanges refuse to allow it to use it. It does not have a 21 million supply and is really a meme coin take on Bitcoin with zero utility.\n\nNevertheless, as a meme coin that has achieved a level of virality, HPOS10I has attracted substantial interest, providing an example of the power of 'bitcoin' brand name recognition. From launch to peak, HPOS10I has returned 66,000% for early investors, provided they sold at the top.\n\nBut Bitcoin BSC is looking to play at the more serious end of the spectrum, where coins such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV have attracted considerable attention as alternatives to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, these assets are forks from the original blockchain and carry all the baggage and complications that come with that, such as maintaining and developing the protocol.\n\nStill, Bitcoin Cash was the earliest such fork if we exclude Litecoin, and although it is some way off its highs, it has nevertheless been able to outperform Bitcoin in recent weeks.\n\nBitcoin BSC could rise 7x or more after launch, as BTC20 did\n\nThen there's BTC20 coin which launched a little over a month ago and also compares favorably to Bitcoin. While bitcoin has slid, at one stage slipping under $25,000 earlier this week, BTC20 has not only stayed in the green, it has been earning yield for its stakers.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is down 7.3% in the past 30 days, BTC20 is up 14% on its list price of $1. Bitcoin Cash is up 4.5% in the past month, also outperforming Bitcoin.\n\nWe should also add that in the case of BTC20, shortly after listing, it reached an all-time high of $5.9 for a 6x return for presale investors.\n\nAlthough some of the comparative returns cited above may not feel particularly spectacular by crypto volatility standards, savvy investors who have been around the block will be aware of the improving fundamentals for Bitcoin and how clone coins with better risk-reward potential, like Bitcoin BSC, are likely to benefit in an outsized way.\n\nJoe Parys Crypto YouTube channel, with 300k-plus subscribers, is tipping $BTCBSC as one of five Bitcoin alternatives to see a price explosion.\n\nAnother crypto YouTube analyst has invested $840 into BTCBSC, attracted by the APY as well as the token price appreciation potential.\n\nBitcoin halving could send $BTCBSC price to the moon\n\nBitcoin block rewards are due for their four-yearly halving in April 2024, and if past performance is a guide, the coin is on the cusp of yet another bull run. Each previous halving cycle bull run has seen bitcoin hit higher highs.\n\nAligning with that view, Pantera Capital predicts that the next cycle will be no different. The crypto asset manager reckons bitcoin will retrace back to $36,000 by the end of this year and surge to around $147k in the next halving cycle.\n\nTrue to form, bitcoin derivative coins will be among the leading beneficiaries of the halving cycle bull run, likely to outpace many other altcoins.\n\nBitcoin BSC is in pole position to benefit from the mother of all bull runs\n\nInstitutions and savvy investors have started accumulating Bitcoin in readiness for the next bull run.\n\nAside from the halving, the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF and the flood of new money \u2013 retail and institutional \u2013 that will flow into the Bitcoin and broader crypto market as a result, means the next altcoin season threatens to be the mother of all melt ups.\n\nDo your own research, but it probably makes sense to get ready for the upturn by adding some low-cap sparkle to your portfolio.\n\nA relatively modest allocation now to Bitcoin BSC could turn into 5x or even 100x gains very quickly, and in the near future, as we go into the halving cycle, life-changing profits could be on the table.\n\nIf you think digital currencies like Bitcoin are the future but missed out the first time around, then Bitcoin BSC provides a rare opportunity to grab a slice of the action before the bulls start rampaging.\n\nYou can buy $BTCBSC today with BNB, ETH or USDT. The minimum purchase amount is $10. Buy with BNB if you want to start staking straightaway before the presale ends. Those who choose to buy with ETH can start staking as soon as the presale ends.\n\nMedia contact: pr@bitcoinbsc.io\n\nWebsite: bitcoinbsc.io\n\nSocial Channels: Twitter | Telegram Community\n\nCision\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/can-new-bitcoin-bsc-coin-repeat-the-bitcoin-price-move-from-1-to-30-000-and-mint-more-millionaires-301929396.html\n\nSOURCE Bitcoin BSC"

        "content": "Swan Bitcoin is offering new insight into how Bitcoin stored on its exchange will be held in custody in the future, following a tumultuous month in which many of the company's users were left looking for clarity.\n\nAnnounced Thursday, Swan Bitcoin says it intends to partner with BitGo to launch a \"Bitcoin-only trust company,\" one that would require regulatory approval before ultimately being made live for customers.\n\n\"This strategic partnership aims to cater to the growing demand for Bitcoin-specific solutions while addressing the critical security and custody requirements within the Bitcoin ecosystem,\" a press release sent exclusively to Bitcoin Magazine read.\n\nSwan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten said in a statement that the plan is to either acquire an existing trust company, or build one. If they choose to acquire, he said they aim to be live with customers by Q1 2024. If, instead, they build a new trust, the goal is to go live by Q3.\n\nKlippsten further detailed how the move builds on an existing collaboration between the companies, explaining that BitGo has held all of Swan users\u2019 custodied coins in cold storage since June, which will continue. He claims Fortress does not custody Swan clients\u2019 coins except for small amounts temporarily when satisfying withdrawal requests.\n\nBitGo CEO Mike Belshe echoed Klippsten's claims, saying the companies have been collaborating on a solution for some time. Prior to Fortress and BitGo, Swan Bitcoin used Prime Trust as its preferred custody partner.\n\nPrime Trust filed for bankruptcy in August, claiming a shortfall of customer funds.\n\n\"Our teams have worked closely together for nearly a year on stronger qualified custody models,\" Belshe said. \"Early in 2023, we recognized the opportunity to establish a Bitcoin-only custodian, combining the capabilities of each company.\"\n\nThe trust's announcement follows the acquisition of Fortress by Ripple, a cryptocurrency company formed in 2012 that is devoted to evangelizing the XRP digital asset. The acquisition of Fortress by Ripple caused a stir on social media, especially given that Klippsten has previously accused Ripple of fraud.\n\nOf note is that Swan Bitcoin actively discourages customers from holding Bitcoin on its exchange, an industry best practice that has limited client exposure to Fortress.\n\nElsewhere, the press release was forward-looking and aspirational, with Klippsten seeking to highlight his desire to create a Bitcoin-only custodian that would satisfy his customer's concerns, limiting their exposure to the cryptocurrency ecosystem of which he has been so publicly critical.\n\nFounded in 2013, BitGo is a leading cryptocurrency custody company regarded for its security, though it's notable that, after launching as a Bitcoin-only company, it would go on to add support for hundreds of crypto assets.\n\nStill, the prospect of the creation of a Bitcoin-only custodian will likely find an appeal with Swan Bitcoin's users, while Klippsten said they expect to serve company treasuries, asset managers, governments and on-ramps like Swan itself. Though in practice it remains to be seen whether there would be demand for the offering.\n\n\u201cWith the Bitcoin-specific trust company, we'll finally be able to deliver the product that marries the best of self-custody service with the components that require qualified custody. This has never been achievable before, because existing offerings focus on breadth of token support rather than the absolute best custody for Bitcoin,\" said Swan Bitcoin cofounder and CTO Yan Pritzker. \"The new trust company will offer Bitcoin-specific features such as institution-grade advanced wallet management capabilities and more ways for clients to hold their own keys, inheritance planning, and adoption of new Bitcoin standards as they emerge.\"\n\nFor instance, some of Swan's competitors in the Bitcoin-only brokerage space, such as River, already employ their own in-house custody solutions without third parties.\n\n\"For years we\u2019ve heard from major clients, partners, and other Bitcoin companies that they would prefer a Bitcoin-only software and services stack, focused on strictly the best custody leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s unique features,\" said Klippsten. \"Time has proven that altcoins come with risks on many levels. Demand will continue to grow for Bitcoin-only services that avoid many of those risks.\"\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "In the latest episode of Cointelegraph\u2019s Market Talks, host Ray Salmond speaks with Jamie Coutts, a chartered market technician and crypto market analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nWhen asked whether Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) pre- and post-halving price action could differ from previous cycles due to a change in global monetary policy, Coutts said:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been writing about this for most of the year. We do have some strong fundamentals in the space, but ultimately, what drives risk assets is liquidity. The longer that we have this tightening cycle, and if we start to see an uptick in unemployment and more stress in the banking sector, then there could be a bit more pain for risk assets like Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nRelated: The future of BTC mining and the Bitcoin halving\n\nDespite the dim macroeconomic outlook, Coutts did suggest:\n\n\u201cWe could be near the end. There is still a lot of underlying stress in the U.S. banking system and other areas of the economy. I think this is somewhat different to any other Bitcoin cycle that we\u2019ve seen, but ultimately, people will need to keep in mind that we are living in a fiat and credit-money-based money system, and inevitably, there will need to be a return to some form of easing because essentially the system cannot handle long periods of deflation. So, it is still Bitcoin, and to some degree, crypto assets that have control of their inflation schedules that will do well when things start to resume.\u201d\n\nTo hear more about Coutt\u2019s views on the macro, Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins and stablecoins, tune in to the full episode of Market Talks on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.

        "content": "Bitcoin's price this week is near a familiar and key support level, but its latest stop there is a little more worrying than previous ones this year, according to Wolfe Research. Earlier this week, bitcoin fell below $25,000 for the first time since March . The flagship cryptocurrency tested this threshold at various points this year, but it always rebounded. While bitcoin has been floating in the narrow range of $25,000 to $30,000 all year, investors have cheered its resilience knowing potential catalysts such as developments around bitcoin exchange-traded funds were on the horizon. That long-term momentum is starting to break, however. That means crypto investors who have been patiently waiting for better days may want to consider their positions. \"With support in this area on dual fronts, it makes sense that price would hold and consolidate in this region. However, as we look around, the crypto landscape is growing ever more concerning,\" Wolfe analyst Rob Ginsberg said in a note Wednesday. \"Coins are taking out crucial levels of support across the board and there's not many bright spots to be found at the moment.\" \"Longer term momentum is starting to break in bitcoin,\" he added. \"This is often one of our more reliable warning signs and part of the reason we are currently bearish on the broader market. Short term price action is never our worry, it's when longer term trends start to break, that we want to take notice and pivot accordingly.\" BTC.CM= 6M mountain Bitcoin recently fell below key support at $25,000 for the first time since March. Bitcoin's 50-day moving average began turning lower in August and recently crossed below its 200-day moving average. Although it may be losing momentum, the 200-day moving average is still ascending. The next level of support below $25,000 is at $20,000, Ginsberg said. Further, ether is testing the $1,600 threshold, which has Wolfe \"highly concerned.\" Failure to bounce from that level puts $1,500 at the next level to test on the downside, the firm said. \"As the retail investor comes under pressure and liquidity is drained, our concerns will only grow for crypto prices,\" Ginsberg added. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom and Nick Wells contributed reporting."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Thursday morning in Asia to trade above the US$26,000 support level. Ether also rose to reclaim US$1,600. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies moved up, with Solana spearheading the winners with a 24-hour rise of over 2%. The rally followed the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) release on Wednesday, which showed an acceleration in the annual inflation rate in August, while the core CPI that excludes food and energy prices posed a deceleration. U.S. stock futures traded higher, after Wall Street closed mixed on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin reclaims US$26,000; altcoins stable after bankrupt FTX received approval to liquidate\n\nBitcoin rose 1.45% in the last 24 hours to US$26,251.64 as of 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, adding 1.88% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reclaimed the US$26,000 support level on Wednesday afternoon and touched a daily high of over US$26,370 on early Thursday morning.\n\nDespite reclaiming the key US$26,000 line, Bitcoin\u2019s momentum has seemingly weakened on Tuesday, but is \u201cstill strong enough to hold on to most of what was reclaimed after the bounce,\u201d Keith Alan, co-founder of monitoring resource Material Indicators, tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin still faces multiple technical resistances, including a \u201cdeath cross\u201d between the token\u2019s 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages \u2013 which currently sit at US$27,444 and US$27,670, as well as a 100-day moving average at US$28,292 that outlines the ceiling of the range, according to Alan on Tuesday.\n\nEther also gained 0.95% to US$1,609.32 but still traded 1.64% lower in the past seven days. The second top crypto reached a 24-hour high of US$1,619.11 on Tuesday night.\n\nBitcoin and Ether prices briefly dipped on early Thursday morning in Asia after the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX received court approval to sell its US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets. The selling is capped at US$100 million per week, which can be extended to US$200 million.\n\nFTX\u2019s current crypto holdings include US$1.16 billion in Solana\u2019s SOL and US$560 million in Bitcoin, according to a Monday court filing.\n\nDespite the incoming FTX liquidation, crypto prices remain largely stable. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted gains in the past 24 hours. SOL led the winners, which rose 2.70% to US$18.43 but lost 6.70% for the week.\n\nVisa wrote in a Tuesday research report that Solana blockchain \u201chas attributes like high transaction throughput and scalability at low cost that help make it a good candidate for payments and Visa\u2019s stablecoin settlement pilot.\u201d The global payment giant announced a partnership with Solana on Sept. 5 to expand its USDC stablecoin settlement pilot to Solana\u2019s blockchain\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 1.07% in the past 24 hours to US$1.04 trillion, while trading volume dropped 21.30% to US$27.63 billion.\n\n\u201cThe recent stability could be attributed to steady CPI data, as is common amongst high-risk asset classes,\u201d said John Stefanidis, CEO and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure DAO, Balthazar DAO.\n\n\u201cMoreover, it seems the crypto market may have already priced in the potential ramifications of FTX\u2019s approved sale of its substantial $3.4 billion crypto asset portfolio,\u201d added Stefanidis.\n\nU.S. annual inflation rate accelerates\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading higher as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, after Wall Street closed mixed on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite logging gains while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging lower.\n\nMost main stock indexes in Asia rose on Thursday morning. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 all logged gains, while China\u2019s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.03%.\n\nThe U.S. CPI release on Wednesday sent mixed information to the market. The inflation gauge rose 3.7% by year in August, an acceleration from 3.2% in July. The August CPI also booked a monthly gain of 0.6%, the biggest increase since June 2022.\n\nThe accelerated CPI growth aligns with analysts\u2019 expectation, according to Reuters on Thursday. Gasoline price, which jumped 10.6% in August, accounted for over 50% of the CPI growth in the month.\n\nMeanwhile, the core CPI \u2014 which excludes the volatile food and energy prices \u2014 rose 4.3% by year in August, a deceleration from 4.7% in July and the smallest reading since September 2021.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing here to seriously put a Fed rate hike on the table next week, but there is enough to keep the debate about the need for one more hike in 2023 alive,\u201d Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at U.S.-based investment bank Brean Capital, told Reuters.\n\nGiven the mixed CPI data, J.P.Morgan Asset Management wrote on Wednesday it expects the Federal Reserve to make no further interest rate hike in this monetary tightening cycle.\n\n\u201cDespite still rising oil prices in early September, we expect the impact of oil price spikes on CPI to be limited,\u201d J.P.Morgan\u2019s Chief Global Strategist David Kelly said in a note viewed by Reuters, who expects the annual inflation rate will fall below the Fed\u2019s long-term goal of 2% by the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 97% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in its meeting on Sept. 20, which is currently in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%. It gives a 58.4% chance for another pause in November, up from 56.8% on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. August producer price index (PPI) is set to be released on Thursday, with analysts expecting the data to rise 1.2% by year, up from 0.8% in July. The data will provide further insights into the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\n(Updates with equity section, comment from Stefanidis.)"

        "content": "Our next guest says the market is severely underestimating the impact of a US bought Bitcoin ETF joining us. Now to discuss the crypto markets is K 33 senior analyst Veel Lund. Welcome Veel. Thank you a pleasure to be back. Glad to see you again. So why do you think the the the market is, is, is putting lower odds on the spot uh ETF approval um compared to what you think it is. I I, you know what, what's the difference and why essentially I don't think that the market is putting lower odds on an approval, but I think that the market overemphasizes short term news and have a very short sighted focus on the most recent headlines. For instance, today we talk about macro while Bitcoin's correlation to the NASDAQ and the DXY is at most comparable to PRE COVID. And I'll also talk about the FDX Bankruptcy estate. So the market has a tendency to focus on the recent events and forget about the big launches that has been announced prior. So I think it's just the fact of the market forgetting that uh there there are very solid fundamentals ahead and that uh Yeah. Yeah. So, so you see that the potential I, you know, when you talk about that is that uh a 66% chan uh a 66% rally potentially happening in Bitcoin going up to $42,000. That's incredible. Take a look at the chart that you, you've given us here. Uh Can you explain uh explain what's going on in that chart? Yeah. So um this, this chart is based on uh uh multiple data sets uh that are uh looking into the previous uh impact on the market that flow into Bitcoin investment vehicles have had. And from those uh charts, we have previous system that uh throughout 2020 up until 2023 Bitcoin tended to yield at 23.5% return when ETP inflows uh was higher than 20,000 BT C. Uh So, we have identified a positive price relationship between inflows to Bitcoin exchange traded vehicles and the Bitcoin price. Um This is due to uh supply, being absorbed in the spot market and being pulled into investment vehicles uh which has deep and uh immediate uh effects on liquidity and in a market where um the, the general activity in the market is quite low. Uh The the of the needle is uh on the net buyer and the net seller. And in an event with a MD F approval, the net buyer will um be able to contribute quite dramatically to if the market is our base view. I want to move now to another chart that you sent through to us. This is from K 33 research. It highlights Bitcoin's rolling 30 day return and rolling 30 day flows into Bitcoin investment vehicles. Uh Talk to us a little bit about what we're seeing here. Yeah. So essentially this is one of the components that uh we used to generate the previous chart. And you here see the Bitcoin rolling 30 day uh returns versus the Bitcoin inflows or outflows to investment vehicles over a 30 day horizon. And it's quite clear here that it is a relationship between inflows to exchange traded vehicles or investment vehicles and the, the Bitcoin prices. And likewise for outflows uh flows tends to dictate the general movement of the market. And that's like the core reason why we are really very bullish on the ETF prospects and think that this is a very constructive development for the market. And also why I hyperbolically stated that the market was wrong and that current prices are very good for investors seeking to build long term exposure in Bitcoin. So let's talk about short term though. Uh your favorite uh where where do you see it? You know, as we go into this now, um the, the potential, at least that uh we, we might have high interest rates or higher interest rates even. Uh We, we're seeing that in Europe, we might even get that in the United States sometime before the end of the year. Uh What does that mean? Ultimately for Bitcoin over the next several months, do you see, do you have any support and levels that you see happening uh given, given the the current environment? Yeah, so, so Glenn was on there yesterday and he had some uh quite robust uh support and resistance lines that have been very relevant for the last six months. 57,000 are areas worth focusing on. Uh but it's not really that much that have happened in the last six months, whereas uh to touch on this with Macro. Um so as I touched upon earlier today, um the DXIY correlation is uh very low. Uh Bitcoin is currently not showing any real signs of uh uh like reacting properly to big Big Mac headlines or, or um uh not in the extent that it did previously. And uh uh interest rate uh effects on Bitcoin is quite challenging to assess uh as uh things is, things are right now. Uh because you have this very odd uh impact from Tedder, which um I have publicly stated that they aim to allocate 15% of their net operating profits to uh Bitcoin allocations. So, in that regard, higher interest rates create an environment where at least one big buyer will acquire more Bitcoin because they earn more cash on their treasury notes. All right, we're gonna have to leave it there. Veel. Thanks so much for joining the show again. It was a pleasure seeing you this morning. Thank you. I'm glad to be on. That was K 33 senior analyst Veil."

        "title": "Forget About a Bitcoin ETF, This Might Be the Real Catalyst Bitcoin Needs - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Over the past few months, much attention has been given to the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin (BTC -1.08%) exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Many investors and analysts believe such approval will be a catalyst for broader adoption of Bitcoin because it would allow institutional money managers to include the ETF in various investment vehicles, such as pension funds and 401(k)s.\n\nHowever, as the SEC stalls on its review of the multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications, another profound development recently occurred, and it could be more meaningful.\n\nA much-needed update\n\nOn Sept. 6, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) announced its intention to introduce new fair-value accounting rules explicitly tailored for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These rules, expected to be formally published by year-end and fully effective by 2025, signal a significant stride toward achieving much-needed clarity in cryptocurrency accounting.\n\nThe SEC has designated the FASB to set accounting standards for publicly traded companies, and the board's decision to implement new cryptocurrency accounting standards will eliminate much of the ambiguity that companies interested in holding cryptocurrencies previously had to navigate.\n\nThis development has yet to garner as much attention as the pending approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, yet the FASB's new guidelines could be just as transformative. Companies (private and public) will now be able to efficiently and accurately manage their digital assets, eliminating another barrier previously impeding adoption.\n\nBreaking down the new fair value accounting rules\n\nUnder the previous set of rules, Bitcoin was typically classified as an intangible asset. So if the market value of Bitcoin plummeted after the initial purchase, companies would need to recognize the losses in the form of impairment charges on their financial statements.\n\nThe problem with impairment charges is that they negatively affect reported income and threaten the overall health of a company's balance sheet. Making matters worse, if Bitcoin's price ascended, companies could only benefit from the appreciation if they sold their holdings, thereby losing the chance for long-term profits.\n\nWith the impending adoption of the new FASB rules, companies will no longer have to report unrealized crypto losses in the form of impairment charges on their profit-and-loss statement. Instead, they will now be able to disclose Bitcoin's true fair value on their balance sheets during quarterly financial reporting in the form of an unrealized loss, which is much more advantageous.\n\nFurthermore, these guidelines will allow companies to recognize unrealized gains as assets, a previously discouraged practice. By including unrealized gains in quarterly earnings, companies capture a tangible benefit that is discernible on balance sheets, allowing investors to gauge a company's financial health more accurately.\n\nA catalyst for corporate Bitcoin adoption\n\nAlthough the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs might democratize exposure to the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, the approval itself wouldn't contain any guidance on how a company should manage its crypto holdings. With revamped and more-straightforward rules, though, this will all change.\n\nWhen companies such as Tesla or MicroStrategy decided to add Bitcoin to their holdings years ago, they were plunging into uncharted waters. While they have navigated this uncertainty relatively well since then, the absence of a conducive accounting framework likely deterred many other companies when weighing the pros and cons of a Bitcoin strategy.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of crypto fair-value accounting standards by the FASB, companies are more likely to reconsider holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets since they can now benefit from unrealized appreciation and minimize negative effects on their income should prices slip.\n\nThe FASB plan alone should be celebrated as a victory, since it recognizes the growing corporate interest in Bitcoin and bolsters its legitimacy across the broader financial landscape. To the benefit of investors especially, these new rules lay a foundation for widespread adoption, and with Bitcoin's limited supply, this could lead to potential long-term price appreciation."

        "title": "These Are the 5 Wallets With the Most Bitcoin in the World - - Altcoin Buzz",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s popularity is hard for anyone to ignore. Although we can\u2019t predict whether Bitcoin will replace the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency, Bitcoin is unquestionably the biggest decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) payment network. We are certain that Bitcoin will power a new financial system.\n\nSo, It would surprise you to know that the top wallets with the most Bitcoin belong to top financial institutions and organizations. While that\u2019s not exactly a problem, it births a certain curiosity as to why these guys are into BTC and whether it is significant for the crypto market. Now let\u2019s list the wallets with the most Bitcoin. This list will feature both individual and corporate owners.\n\n1) Satoshi Nakamoto (1.1 million BTCs)\n\nDespite the mystery surrounding Nakamoto\u2019s identity, it is certain that they mined around one million bitcoins between 2009 and 2010, stored in about 22,000 wallet addresses. Many people think Nakamoto purposefully pulled these bitcoins from circulation, but it\u2019s unclear who has access to this sizable BTC reserve.\n\nAll of it was never used, except for a few test transactions. Since quitting the project in 2010, Satoshi has avoided the spotlight and remained mysterious.\n\n20th richest person in the world may now be anonymous. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, could be worth $60 billion if estimates of their holdings are correct. The world is changing. pic.twitter.com/5UmJgPONcu \u2014 Documenting \u20bfitcoin \ud83d\udcc4 (@DocumentingBTC) April 2, 2021\n\nHowever, more than 100 BTCs were transferred from two abandoned Satoshi wallets a year ago. The Bitcoin wallet was dormant for over a decade, which has sparked debate in the Bitcoin community. In June 2010, both addresses received 50 BTC for mining blocks. There was basically no activity for a number of years.\n\n2) Grayscale: (643,572 BTCs)\n\nGrayscale is the biggest asset manager to continue selling shares of its crypto assets on the US stock market. The company owns about 643,572 BTC or nearly 3% of the total supply.\n\nBreaking: Arkham has identified the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\u2019s holdings on chain. It is the 2nd largest BTC entity globally, holding >$16B of BTC. Though Grayscale publicly reports balances, they have refused to identify the on-chain addresses of the trust. https://t.co/uEN4kNldpm pic.twitter.com/p9GfrthoKR \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) September 6, 2023\n\nGrayscale is one of the many companies that have filed for a Bitcoin ETF. However, the SEC rejected this request in 2022 due to a purported lack of surveillance competence. Grayscale sued the SEC, claiming that the latter permitted the Bitcoin Futures ETF. Grayscale secured a mini-victory against the SEC in August after a court ordered the regulator to reconsider Grayscale\u2019s application.\n\n3) Binance: (498,147 BTCs)\n\nIt is only natural that Binance\u2019s cold storage wallets contain significant quantities of BTC, given that the company is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Binance currently has 498,197 BTC, the most in a single wallet.\n\nBinance POR: Ethereum holdings declined while Bitcoin and USDT steadied \u2014 Bradicoin (@Bradicoin10) September 11, 2023\n\nThe nature of Binance\u2019s services is a reason why it owns lots of BTC. Platforms like Binance make it easier to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Exchanges like Binance also affect the liquidity of Bitcoin.\n\n4) Bitfinex: (192, 508 BTCs )\n\nBitfinex holds about 168,010 BTC and is one of the biggest players in the Bitcoin market. Interestingly, the exchange suffered a hack in 2016 that wiped off 119,756 BTC, which at the time was valued at $66 million. The US Department of Justice recently unveiled the faces behind the attack.\n\nThere\u2019s no way those two people hacked Bitfinex. There\u2019s more to the story. \u2014 Brady Swenson (@CitizenBitcoin) February 10, 2022\n\n5) U.S. Government: (175,000 BTCs)\n\nThe United States is the country with the most bitcoins. Of course, the US did not purchase these bitcoins from an exchange. Instead, this mass wealth of BTC was seized from the Silk Road, Bitfinex, and the seizure of James Zhong\u2019s BTC. Over the years, many government agencies have confiscated Bitcoin. There\u2019s little accountability over what the government does with its stash of bitcoin.\n\nAfter seizing the Bitfinex hacked funds, the US government is now one of the largest hodlers of Bitcoin. \u2014 Dan Held (@danheld) February 9, 2022\n\nThese are the top five holders: But there are others with respectable ownership of BTC:\n\nMicrostrategy: 152,800.\n\nBlock dot one: 140,000.\n\nOKX: 118,334.\n\nRobinhood: 118,300.\n\nWinklevoss: 70,000.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe identity and impact of Bitcoin\u2019s largest holders will continue to be hot-button issues as BTC develops and becomes widely accepted. Anyone active in the Bitcoin market, either as an investor, trader, or spectator, needs to understand these factors.\n\n\u2013 For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2013 Unlock the key to managing your crypto portfolio like a PRO!

        "title": "11 Bitcoin blockchain metrics TradFi organizations should watch - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Many who aren\u2019t crypto industry insiders may view \u201cBitcoin\u201d and \u201ccrypto\u201d as basically synonymous. While members of the traditional finance industry know that there\u2019s much more to crypto than Bitcoin, they also know that Bitcoin\u2019s performance and health serve as a bellwether for the acceptance and growth of the overall crypto industry.\n\nMonitoring select blockchain metrics can help financial institutions and investors gauge market sentiment, predict changes in values and identify investment risks and opportunities not only in terms of Bitcoin, but also the larger crypto industry. Below, 11 members of Cointelegraph Innovation Circle detail Bitcoin blockchain metrics TradFi organizations would be wise to watch.\n\nRealized cap\n\nRealized cap is an on-chain metric that shows the total sum of profits and losses from all on-chain sales and purchases. An increasing realized cap would mean new investors are buying and selling Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) for higher prices. This also means that the net sum of trades is in profits, and therefore, people are now bullish on Bitcoin. \u2013 Abhishek Singh, Acknoledger\n\nHalving\n\nBitcoin halving should be considered by financial institutions because it can influence Bitcoin\u2019s price through altered supply dynamics, potentially impacting miner profitability and network security. Halving can indicate broader mainstream adoption trends, present speculative opportunities and serve as a focal point for educational and marketing initiatives within the finance sector. \u2013 Irina Litchfield, Lumeria\n\nHash rate\n\nAs financial institutions explore cryptocurrencies, they should focus on a key Bitcoin blockchain measure: the hash rate. The hash rate measures the network\u2019s strength and security by gauging its computational power. Keeping an eye on Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate helps financial institutions assess the stability of the network and any investment risks linked to cryptocurrencies. \u2013 Vinita Rathi, Systango\n\nGrowth in the number of wallets with large holdings\n\nIn addition to the often-discussed \u201chalving\u201d of Bitcoin, financial institutions should also pay heed to the growth in the number of wallets holding large amounts of BTC. A wallet with a small amount of BTC could probably be assumed to be a retail investor, while wallets holding large amounts could potentially be \u201cwhales\u201d or institutional holders. \u2013 Zain Jaffer, Zain Ventures\n\nNumber of solutions leveraging Bitcoin security\n\nI think it\u2019s useful to look at how many solutions are leveraging Bitcoin security through timestamping \u2014 or even better, merged mining \u2014 because all of that value will be leveraged and, thus, fed back into Bitcoin. For example Syscoin, Namecoin and Dogecoin merge mine and add value to ancillary chains. Many overlook the external value being built by leveraging Bitcoin security. \u2013 Jagdeep Sidhu, Syscoin Foundation\n\nDeFi velocity\n\nDeFi velocity (DFY) is a valuable metric for Web3 investors. In addition to total value locked, DFY also factors in volume to shed light on the user engagement and capital efficiency of a specific crypto market. Overall, this metric can help institutions differentiate between stagnant capital and healthy economic activity. \u2013 Wolfgang R\u00fcckerl, ENT Technologies AG\n\nTransaction volume\n\nBitcoin transaction volume is a key blockchain metric for financial institutions monitoring crypto adoption and market activity. It refers to the specific number of transactions that occur on the Bitcoin blockchain within a specific timeframe. Financial institutions may find this metric essential as they explore crypto, as it shows trends, user engagement, risk and more. \u2013 Anthony Georgiades, Pastel Network\n\nBitcoin distribution\n\nMonitoring the distribution of Bitcoin helps show macro trends in market sentiment. For example, analyzing the circulating supply of Bitcoin held by BTC \u201cwhales\u201d (those who own more than 1,000 BTC) versus that held by BTC \u201cshrimp\u201d (those who own fewer than 1 BTC) helps financial institutions gauge risk exposure and the behavior of different investor groups to predict price stability and potential volatility. \u2013 Sheraz Ahmed, STORM Partners\n\nMiner revenue from transaction fees\n\nEver-increasing energy costs and future halving events are presenting compounding challenges for Bitcoin miners. However, the rise of Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens is positioning miner revenue from transaction fees to become a new key vector to consider when calculating network health. As Bitcoin diversifies to accommodate a service economy, there\u2019s no telling what novel applications could arise. \u2013 Oleksandr Lutskevych, CEX.IO\n\nNumber of unique wallet addresses\n\nThere is a direct correlation between market sentiment and the number of unique wallet addresses, and financial institutions can use this metric to infer Bitcoin\u2019s strength. As Bitcoin becomes stronger as a store of value and the Lightning Network slowly and steadily begins handling micro payments, the growth of unique wallet addresses will become a strong predictor of market sentiment. \u2013 Tiago Ser\u00f4dio, Partisia Blockchain\n\nBitcoin days destroyed\n\nFinancial institutions should measure Bitcoin days destroyed (BDD), which is the number of days since BTC was last moved multiplied by the amount exchanged. It reveals high-volume, low-value economic activities. BDD increases when long-term BTC holders sell \u2014 often before major market changes. \u2013 Arvin Khamseh, SOLDOUT NFTs\n\nThis article was published through Cointelegraph Innovation Circle, a vetted organization of senior executives and experts in the blockchain technology industry who are building the future through the power of connections, collaboration and thought leadership.

        "content": "The European Central Bank announced its 10th straight rate hike just minutes ago, lifting interest rates by a quarter. I believe that this is a record. What does this mean? Are we gonna see some, uh are we gonna see the stop now that we hit the 10th rate hike? So, ok, look, I I if you follow crypto markets, the European interest rates alone might not mean anything because most crypto is priced in, let's be honest, tether us DT which is a US dollar derivative if we can call it that. Um But what it does indicate is the potential or at least an excuse for the, for the federal reserve to potentially raise rates again. I mean, will they do it in September? The, the, the upcoming meeting, the odds are or at least the way the markets are predicting now, it's not gonna happen this meeting, but at the very least we've seen a couple of data points over the past day. Yes, it, today, in fact, we saw the PP I uh the wholesale index, it's up a lot higher than expected. Uh Y yesterday we saw the CP I number come in hotter than expected a little bit hotter than expected. But nonetheless, it tells us that inflation isn't under control the way perhaps the fed wants it to be and what that means is. Ok. Well, this idea that the fed will cut rates and make it easier for people to borrow money and leverage and do all those things to trade crypto and take on that risk. That might not happen right away. That's gonna be further out into the future if at all. So we might have a little bit more time where the FED is trying to keep the, the, the market led the liquidity if you will or, or the the amount of money in the in the sloshing around the market, uh trying to keep it down to lower inflation. Uh lots of other ways they can do it, by the way, besides raising rates, of course, is to sell off some of its portfolio. We haven't, you know, we've seen some movements in that obviously uh over, you know, planned movements uh for, for the past several months, be curious to see actually going forward if that then becomes a tool of the FED. I don't know yet. It doesn't seem like that anybody's been talking about that. But when it has trillions of dollars on the balance sheet, it also offers an opportunity for the Fed to take, take some other measures besides just raising rates to uh to dampen inflation."

Fidelity's product has simplified the process, largely by starting investors with just a few crypto options.\n\nFidelity Crypto could be appealing for investors who are curious about cryptocurrency and already know and trust Fidelity with their investments.\n\nBut if you\u2019re already a hardcore crypto investor, chances are you\u2019re not going to be interested in switching for these new offerings alone. While Fidelity\u2019s low trading costs are competitive with some of the leading crypto exchanges, the selection and crypto functionality announced by the firm are not yet up to par.\n\nFor instance, Fidelity offers only two cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum. And users can't send or receive cryptocurrency from their accounts, a must for users who want to use crypto for payments or to access blockchain-based services on the web.

That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean trading is free. The company says it takes a spread of up to 1% on crypto trades.\n\nStill, that\u2019s relatively good compared with other crypto services reviewed by NerdWallet. Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based exchange focused solely on crypto, often charges a fee of $2.99 on simple transactions, which would exceed 1% on small purchases.\n\nOther crypto services can have significantly higher fees, with some upward of 10% depending on how you pay.\n\nFunding and minimums\n\nFunding a Fidelity Crypto account could be easy if you already have a brokerage or cash management account with the company. You\u2019ll be able to move money from Fidelity accounts into Fidelity Crypto.\n\nThere\u2019s no minimum deposit to open a crypto trading account. And the minimum crypto purchase is $1, Fidelity says. These factors put the company on even footing with most other leading exchanges.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a Fidelity account, making purchases will require you to create and fund an account such as a brokerage or cash management account.\n\nWhy you might want to use another exchange\n\nAvailability\n\nFidelity Crypto is initially available 35 states. If you can\u2019t access the service in your state, you\u2019ll have to go with another option.\n\nCrypto selection\n\nFidelity Crypto\u2019s offerings are on the low end among cryptocurrency platforms reviewed by NerdWallet. Granted, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most valuable cryptocurrencies, which means they are widely used and relatively well-established in this emerging sector.\n\nHowever, cryptocurrency traders often look at more options when they are buying and selling. Crypto.com, another major cryptocurrency exchange, has more than 300 cryptocurrencies for sale. Other brokerages also have more crypto options. SoFi, for example, has about 20.\n\nIt may turn out that Fidelity follows the path of other brokerages, such as Robinhood, which started with limited crypto offerings, then expanded over time.\n\nFunctionality\n\nFidelity Crypto does not offer some of the advanced features available on competing exchanges. It doesn't allow staking, a process that allows owners of some cryptocurrencies to earn rewards similar to interest.\n\nAnd unlike some other crypto exchanges, Fidelity Crypto does not offer round-the-clock crypto transactions, with trading limited to 4 a.m. to 12 a.m. Eastern time.\n\nFinally, the company says it does not allow customers to transfer cryptocurrency out of their accounts or to external crypto wallets.\n\nTransfers are crucial if you want to do anything with cryptocurrency other than hold it in hopes that it will increase in value. You won\u2019t be able to use crypto purchased through Fidelity on decentralized finance products, for instance.\n\nTrack your finances all in one place Find ways to save more by tracking your income and net worth on NerdWallet.

        "title": "Bitcoin's Energy Consumption Debate: Unpacking the Latest Developments - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The ongoing discussion over Bitcoin's energy use has captivated the world's attention. Concerns about the flagship cryptocurrency's environmental impact have grown as it has grown in popularity and value. Bitcoin's energy-intensive mining process, critics contend, contributes to carbon emissions and exacerbates climate change. Proponents, on the other hand, underline the possibility of a greener Bitcoin future and the importance of distinguishing between energy sources.\n\nBitcoin Mining Consumes a Lot of Energy\n\nThe mining process is at the heart of the Bitcoin energy consumption argument. Mining is the process of creating new bitcoins and adding transactions to the blockchain. It entails solving complex mathematical riddles with specialized hardware, which is referred to as Proof of Work (PoW).\n\nPoW mining necessitates a huge amount of computational power, resulting in significant energy consumption. The miners compete to solve problems, and the winner receives newly produced bitcoins. This energy-intensive method has been criticized, especially in an era when sustainability and environmental concerns are top priorities.\n\nTesla's U-turn on Bitcoin and the Environment\n\nElon Musk, CEO of electric vehicle producer Tesla, officially declared that Tesla will take Bitcoin as payment for its automobiles, which was a watershed point in the Bitcoin energy consumption discussion. However, Musk quickly altered his decision, expressing concerns about Bitcoin's environmental impact.\n\nMusk's comments spurred a broader discussion on the carbon impact of bitcoin. Bitcoin's energy consumption, according to critics, exceeds that of entire countries, while supporters believe that the cryptocurrency's energy consumption should be evaluated in the context of its potential advantages and the broader financial system.\n\nThe 50% Renewable Energy Benchmark\n\nThe adoption of renewable energy sources in Bitcoin mining has reached a significant milestone, with over 50% of mining energy now coming from sustainable sources. This shift has been driven by several factors, including the dispersal of miners from China following the country's mining ban in 2021 and the utilization of stranded and excess energy resources by certain nations for mining purposes.\n\nSustainable Energy Sources Rise >50%\n\n\ud83d\udc49Falling emissions plus a dramatically rising hash rate can only mean one thing; Bitcoin mining is consuming more sustainable energy in its mix. pic.twitter.com/AGXrKWDWuI \u2014 Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) September 14, 2023\n\nAs of September 14, Bloomberg analyst Jamie Coutts reported on X (formerly Twitter) that more than 50% of Bitcoin mining energy is now sourced from renewable and sustainable sources.\n\nThis achievement is notable as it demonstrates a commitment to reducing the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining.\n\nSeveral countries have actively embraced Bitcoin mining and renewable energy. El Salvador, for instance, not only recognized Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 but has also invested in mining operations. Other nations such as Bhutan, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates have also shown interest in both Bitcoin mining and sustainable energy sources.\n\nAchieving the 50% renewable energy benchmark in Bitcoin mining is a significant step toward making the cryptocurrency industry more environmentally friendly. This shift may also pave the way for greater acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin by large corporations and institutions concerned about the environmental impact of cryptocurrency.\n\nPerspectives Shifting: The Push for Renewable Energy\n\nOne major aspect in the Bitcoin energy discussion is the increased emphasis on mining with renewable energy sources. Proponents contend that switching to cleaner energy can reduce Bitcoin's environmental impact. Some mining enterprises have relocated in recent years to areas with ample renewable energy, such as hydropower.\n\nNotably, numerous well-known Bitcoin mining companies have pledged to use renewable energy. These measures are considered as a step in the right direction toward making Bitcoin more sustainable. However, the scalability of such initiatives, as well as their long-term impact on Bitcoin's energy consumption, remain open questions.\n\nEl Salvador's Experiment with Bitcoin as Legal Tender\n\nEl Salvador's decision to accept Bitcoin as legal cash introduced a new wrinkle to the argument over energy consumption. While supporters consider this as a big step toward Bitcoin's general acceptance, detractors warn that it may compound the cryptocurrency's energy usage problems.\n\nThe use of geothermal energy for mining in El Salvador has been mentioned as a potential green alternative, however the practicality and sustainability of this technique remain unknown. Protests and legal challenges have erupted in response to the government's decision, highlighting the complications of integrating Bitcoin into a nation's economy.\n\nInstitutional Investors and Sustainability as an ESG Factor\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are becoming increasingly important in the financial world, and Bitcoin's energy use is no exception. Institutional investors, such as asset managers and pension funds, are increasingly incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations into their investment decisions.\n\nAddressing ESG concerns is critical for Bitcoin to acquire wider institutional acceptance. Some investors are looking towards environmentally friendly cryptocurrencies like as Proof of Stake (PoS) alternatives, which use substantially less energy than Bitcoin's PoW-based counterpart. Others are collaborating with Bitcoin mining businesses to promote environmentally friendly operations.\n\nRegulatory Inquiry and the Search for Solutions\n\nRegulators around the world are keeping a tight eye on the bitcoin field, and concerns about energy use are on their radar. There are concerns in some countries about implementing environmental limitations on Bitcoin mining facilities. Regulatory decisions in this area may have a big impact on Bitcoin's future.\n\nTo overcome these issues, researchers, entrepreneurs, and cryptocurrency developers are actively investigating more energy-efficient consensus algorithms than PoW. Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Authority (PoA) are two such instances. These consensus algorithms seek to lower energy usage while maintaining the blockchain's security and integrity.\n\nBitcoin's Promise and Environmental Responsibility in Balance\n\nThe Bitcoin energy consumption discussion emphasizes the importance of striking a careful balance between realizing the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies and mitigating their environmental impact. Bitcoin, also known as \"digital gold,\" provides decentralization, censorship resistance, and financial inclusion to people all around the world. Its importance as a medium of commerce and a store of wealth cannot be overstated.\n\nHowever, it is evident that Bitcoin's energy consumption merits investigation and novel solutions. As the Bitcoin ecosystem evolves, it is critical to investigate sustainable alternatives and shift mining operations to greener energy sources. This transition could be critical for Bitcoin to coexist peacefully with rising ESG concerns and regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe Road Ahead: Conclusion\n\nThe Bitcoin energy usage argument is still active and varied. It highlights the difficulty in reconciling innovation, financial inclusion, and sustainability. As the bitcoin ecosystem evolves, parties ranging from miners to regulators will need to work together to discover viable solutions.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community has launched projects to use renewable energy sources, investigate energy-efficient consensus techniques, and connect with ESG-conscious investors in the hunt for a greener Bitcoin. These initiatives reflect a rising awareness of environmental issues and a commitment to solve them.\n\nFinally, the route forward will necessitate a sophisticated strategy that recognizes both the revolutionary potential of cryptocurrencies and the duty to reduce their environmental effect. The Bitcoin energy usage argument will continue to impact the future of cryptocurrencies and their place in the global financial landscape as developments unfold and technology improves."

        "title": "Why Are These 3 Bitcoin Mining Stocks Surging Today? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nInvestors in a range of cryptocurrency mining stocks are winning big today. As of 1:45 p.m. ET, CleanSpark (CLSK -8.77%), Bit Digital (BTBT -4.00%), Bitfarms (BITF -3.40%), and TeraWulf (WULF -6.03%) investors have seen gains of 7.8%, 7.2%, 4.5%, and 1.8%, respectively, from yesterday's close. Interestingly, each of these companies has given up some of their gains from their intraday highs.\n\nThese moves appear to be driven by a resurgence in Bitcoin prices today. The price of Bitcoin, the most important factor in terms of revenue generation and profitability for these crypto miners, is up 1.8% over the past 24 hours at the time of writing. Additionally, it appears many crypto miners remain bullish on the outlook for Bitcoin prices over time, with the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 being the key catalyst some in the sector are looking to for growth.\n\nSo what\n\nBitcoin prices have traded within a relatively narrow range in recent months, and today's rather significant swing to the upside has been somewhat of an outlier. That said, any sort of significant surge in Bitcoin prices often leads to even greater moves higher in Bitcoin miners, due to the leverage these companies provide to the underlying price of Bitcoin. A 2% surge in Bitcoin often leads to 4% to 8% moves in Bitcoin miners, as these companies benefit disproportionately from higher Bitcoin prices (revenue is denominated in Bitcoin, while debt is mostly denominated in dollars).\n\nFurthermore, budding interest in the upcoming Bitcoin halving event has certainly generated outsize attention for crypto miners. We're now months away from this halving event, in which Bitcoin mining rewards will be halved per block produced. While that shouldn't be a good thing for crypto miners (and probably won't be for the sector as a whole), it does mean that a race is on for market share right now. Investors appear to believe that CleanSpark, Bit Digital, and Bitfarms may be the way to play this sector long-term, judging by these stocks' price movements of late.\n\nNow what\n\nMany investors may continue to view Bitcoin miners as tools or vehicles to gain even greater exposure to the price of Bitcoin. As such, it appears the market is taking an increasingly bullish view on where the price of Bitcoin could be headed (which makes sense, given its upcoming halving).\n\nThat said, it's also true that when Bitcoin declines, these crypto miners often see outsize losses.\n\nI think it's going to be increasingly difficult for investors to pick the winners and losers in the race for Bitcoin mining market share. Thus, this is a sector that may be too volatile for most, and it may simply make more sense to own Bitcoin (for those who are bullish). That said, given the moves many of these Bitcoin-related stocks make on a daily basis, this is certainly a sector to watch, particularly for those looking to trade or invest based on momentum."

        "content": "Crypto Michael, a cryptocurrency analyst in the crypto space, has recently shared some insights on the possible market trend of the Bitcoin (BTC) price before the halving commences. These insights were shared in a video uploaded on the analyst\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nSigns Of A Potential Bull Run\n\nAccording to the recent revelations by Crypto Michael, Bitcoin might be on the brink of a new bull run. In his video, which has garnered over 2,000 views on YouTube, the analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency shows considerable resilience and potential for a surge.\n\nThis optimism stems from various indicators and patterns observed in Bitcoin\u2019s price action. It\u2019s not just Bitcoin\u2019s impending rise that Crypto Michael has highlighted.\n\nThe analyst also mentions that the altcoin market is warming up for a possible upward trend. The expert believes the significance of this parallel bullish movement for altcoins cannot be underestimated.\n\nIt is worth noting that a comprehensive bull market, including both Bitcoin and its altcoin counterparts, could mean significant gains for diversified crypto portfolios.\n\n$45,000 Ahead Of The Bitcoin Halving?\n\nDiving deeper into his analysis, Crypto Michael predicts a potential Bitcoin price of $45,000 before the much-anticipated halving event next year. A halving is crucial in the Bitcoin network, where miners\u2019 rewards for adding new blocks to the blockchain are cut in half.\n\nThis event typically decreases supply and can significantly influence Bitcoin\u2019s price. Historically, the crypto market has experienced bullish trends before and after halvings.\n\nThis cyclical behavior has been observed in the past two halvings, with price surges leading up to and following the event. However, the current market dynamics have left investors in a speculative state, pondering if history will repeat itself.\n\nParticularly, Bitcoin has shown a bearish trend over the past month, down by nearly 10%. The asset plunged from its high of $30,000 in late July to as low as trading just above $25,000 on Monday. However, Bitcoin\u2019s price can be seen to show signs of recovery in the past few weeks.\n\nThe asset trades above $26,000 at the time of writing, with a price of $26,338 and a market cap of $513 billion today. Notably, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is currently up by more than $10 billion compared to its recent market cap value of below $500 billion, seen earlier this month.\n\nIt is worth noting that while its market cap and price have surged over the past two weeks, the asset\u2019s trading has trended in the opposite direction. Particularly, Bitcoin\u2019s daily trading volume has plunged from the $18 billion seen earlier this month to as low as $10 billion, in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Franklin Templeton Joins Spot Bitcoin ETF Race Amidst Regulatory Uncertainty - Forbes India",
        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nFranklin Templeton, a global investment firm, has entered the competitive ring for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). In a recent submission to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company has detailed its plan for a Bitcoin ETF, where Coinbase will serve as the custodian. The ETF will be traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Pricing will rely on the CME's CF Bitcoin Reference Rate\u2013New York Variant.This development comes after the SEC's postponement of decisions on spot ETF applications from several other prominent firms, including WisdomTree, Valkyrie, Fidelity, VanEck, Bitwise, and Invesco. Additionally, an important court ruling on August 29 mandated that the SEC consider Grayscale's request to transform its Bitcoin (BTC) futures ETF into a spot ETF.Franklin Templeton's Bitcoin ETF application acknowledges the regulatory uncertainties surrounding digital assets in the US. It points out that adverse legislative or regulatory changes could significantly impact the value of Bitcoin and related products. Such developments could include measures such as banning or restricting Bitcoins, mining activities, digital wallets, and services related to Bitcoin trading and custody. The company has also shown increasing interest in digital assets, exploring funds blending blockchain technologies with tokenised treasury bonds. With approximately $1.5 trillion in assets under its management, Franklin Templeton's entry into the crypto market adds to the growing institutional interest in digital assets. However, other financial heavyweights, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Fidelity, have already advanced in the regulatory process with their ETF proposals. The SEC is scheduled to review these applications in mid-October. However, historical delays in the regulatory process suggest a final decision may come around March 2024.Franklin Templeton's entry into the Bitcoin ETF race adds to the growing momentum toward greater crypto adoption in traditional finance. The potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the US remains desirable, with investors eagerly awaiting regulatory decisions in the coming months."

        "content": "This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s \u201cThe Withdrawal Issue\u201d. Click here to subscribe now.\n\nA PDF pamphlet of this article is available for download.\n\n\u201cThe reason that we are focused on financial institutions and payment processors is because they are the so-called bottlenecks, or choke-points, in the fraud committed by so many merchants that victimize consumers and launder their illegal proceeds,\u201d Bresnickat explained to the club. \u201cWe hope to close the access to the banking system that mass marketing fraudsters enjoy \u2014 effectively putting a choke hold on it\u2026\u201d\n\nThis concerted effort, later labeled \u201cOperation Choke Point\u201d, targeted a wide range of business categories, including ammunition sales, drug paraphernalia, payday loans, dating services, pornography, telemarketing, tobacco sales, and government grants. This broad application of financial exclusion ultimately prompted multiple lawsuits and federal investigations into the conduct of both the DOJ and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), as well as harsh criticism from all corners.\n\n\u201cThe clandestine Operation Choke Point had more in common with a purge of ideological foes than a regulatory enforcement action\u201d, wrote Frank Keating, a former governor of Oklahoma who served in the DOJ during the Reagan administration, in a 2018 editorial for The Hill. \u201cIt targeted wide swaths of businesses with little regard for whether legal businesses were swept up and harmed. In fact, that seemed to be the goal.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the Trump administration\u2019s DOJ wrote a letter to Congress indicating that Operation Choke Point was officially over. In 2018, the FDIC promised to limit its personnel\u2019s ability to \u201cterminate account relationships\u201d and to put \u201cadditional training\u201d into place for its examiners.\n\nBut in the years since the federal government so blatantly demonstrated its interest in dictating access to banking services and its power to do so deliberately with little or no consequences, many feel that little has changed.\n\nBank Runs, With Bias\n\nOn March 8, 2023, it was announced that the cryptocurrency-focused institution Silvergate Bank would be voluntarily liquidated by its holding company. The bank had been focused on serving cryptocurrency clients since 2013 when its CEO Alan Lane first invested in bitcoin. In 2022, it had acquired the technology behind Meta\u2019s failed stablecoin project, Diem, with hopes of launching its own dollar-backed token. As the cryptocurrency market declined in late 2022, marked by the collapse of one of its biggest clients in cryptocurrency exchange FTX, the bank\u2019s stock price plummeted. It likely did not help that at the same time, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Roger Marshall, and John Kennedy asked Silvergate to disclose details of its financial relationship with collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n\nSoon after, on March 10, 2023, almost ten years to the day from Bresnickat\u2019s public detailing of Operation Choke Point, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was seized by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation and placed under FDIC receivership, marking what was then the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history.\n\nSince 2021, the bank had been increasing its long-term securities holdings but, as the market value of these assets deteriorated amid U.S. dollar inflation and Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, it was left with unrealized losses. Simultaneously, its customers, many of whom were prominent businesses within the cryptocurrency industry and were similarly strained by economic conditions, were withdrawing their money. On March 8, 2023, SVB announced that it had sold more than $21 billion worth of securities, borrowed another $15 billion, and was planning an emergency sale to raise yet another $2.25 billion. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this sparked a run on its remaining funds, totaling some $42 billion in withdrawals by March 9, 2023. On Sunday, March 12, state and federal authorities stepped in; customers of Signature Bank had withdrawn more than $10 billion.\n\nSince 2018, Signature Bank had maintained a focus on cryptocurrency businesses, with some 30% of its deposits coming from the sector by early 2023. Signature Bank had also accrued a large proportion of uninsured deposits, worth some $79.5 billion and constituting almost 90% of its total deposits. It was holding relatively little cash on hand \u2014 only about 5% of its total assets (compared to an industry average of 13%) \u2014 so it was poorly prepared for a run on crypto-friendly banks spurred by SVB\u2019s issues. On March 12, 2023, the New York State Department of Financial Services closed Signature Bank and placed it under FDIC receivership as it faced a mountain of withdrawal requests. At the time, this represented the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history.\n\nFollowing their seizures of SVB and Signature Bank, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC described the takeovers as \u201cdecisive actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system\u201d. But others suggested the actions, particularly against Signature Bank, signified a blatant reemergence of the prejudice displayed during Operation Choke Point and connected to a larger effort to stymie cryptocurrency businesses.\n\n\u201cI think part of what happened was that regulators wanted to send a very strong anti-crypto message\u201d, Barney Frank, a Signature Bank Board member and former congressman who helped draft the seminal \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d to overhaul financial regulation following the Great Recession, told CNBC in March 2023. \u201cWe became the poster boy because there was no insolvency based on the fundamentals.\u201d\n\nFollowing an FDIC announcement that Flagstar Bank would assume all of Signature Bank\u2019s cash deposits except for those \u201crelated to the digital-asset banking businesses\u201d, the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal announced that Frank was right to call out this bias.\n\n\u201cThis confirms Mr. Frank\u2019s suspicions \u2014 and ours \u2014 that Signature\u2019s seizure was motivated by regulators\u2019 hostility toward crypto\u201d, the board wrote. \u201cThat means crypto companies will have to find another bank to safeguard their deposits. Many say that government warnings to banks about doing business with crypto customers is making that hard.\u201d\n\nTargeting A New Choke Point\n\nPublic officials, financial professionals, and Bitcoin advocates had been pointing out an apparent bias against cryptocurrency businesses from the Biden administration well before the March 2023 bank runs. There were numerous policy events in the early part of 2023 to back up those sentiments.\n\nA January 3, 2023, \u201cJoint Statement on Crypto-Asset Risks to Banking Organizations\u201d from the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) noted that, \u201cThe events of the past year have been marked by significant volatility and the exposure of vulnerabilities in the crypto-asset sector. These events highlight a number of key risks associated with crypto-assets and crypto-asset sector participants that banking organizations should be aware of\u2026\u201d, effectively serving to dissuade financial institutions from taking on those risks.\n\nA White House \u201cRoadmap to Mitigate Cryptocurrencies\u2019 Risks\u201d released on January 27, 2023, indicated that the Biden administration sees the proliferation of cryptocurrencies as a threat to the country\u2019s financial system and warned against the prospect of granting cryptocurrencies more access to mainstream financial products.\n\n\u201cAs an administration, our focus is on continuing to ensure that cryptocurrencies cannot undermine financial stability, to protect investors, and to hold bad actors accountable\u201d, per the roadmap. \u201cLegislation should not greenlight mainstream institutions, like pension funds, to dive headlong into cryptocurrency markets\u2026 It would be a grave mistake to enact legislation that reverses course and deepens the ties between cryptocurrencies and the broader financial system.\u201d\n\nOn February 7, 2023, the Federal Reserve pushed a rule to the Federal Register clarifying that the institution would \u201cpresumptively prohibit\u201d state member banks from holding crypto assets as principal in any amount and that \u201cissuing tokens on open, public, and/or decentralized networks, or similar systems is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices\u201d.\n\nAnd on May 2, 2023, the Biden administration proposed a Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax, suggested as a way to force cryptocurrency mining operations to financially compensate the government for the \u201ceconomic and environmental costs\u201d of their practices with a 30% tax on the electricity they use.\n\nFor Brian Morgenstern, the head of public policy at Riot Platforms, one of the largest, publicly traded bitcoin miners based in the U.S., these policy suggestions, updates, and rule changes clearly indicate a larger attempt to hinder Bitcoin advancement by targeting financial choke points.\n\n\u201cThe White House has proposed an excise tax on electricity use by Bitcoin mining businesses specifically \u2014 an admitted attempt to control legal activity they do not like, in the name of environmental protection\u201d, Morgenstern explained in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe only explanation for such inexplicable behavior is deep-rooted bias in favor of the status quo and against decentralization.\u201d\n\nCollectively, this behavior could influence the conduct of regulated banks, just as the pressure applied by the DOJ in the 2010s unduly limited the businesses in its crosshairs back then. For many, it\u2019s clear that Operation Choke Point has been reinstated.\n\n\u201c\u2018Operation Choke Point 2.0\u2019 refers to the coordinated effort by the Biden administration\u2019s financial regulators to suffocate our domestic crypto economy by de-banking the industry and severing entrepreneurs from the capital necessary to invest here in America\u201d, U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty, a member of the committees on banking and appropriations, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt appears that financial regulators have bought into the false narrative that cryptocurrency-focused businesses solely exist to facilitate or conduct illicit activities, and they seem blind to the opportunities for the potential innovations and new businesses that can be built.\u201d\n\nPressure Where It Hurts\n\nIt may be fairly obvious how such a pressure campaign by federal regulators would hurt cryptocurrency-focused projects that depend on access to banks. But the larger ramifications of such financial prohibitions for retail customers and the advancement of Bitcoin in particular may not be.\n\nWhy should proponents of Bitcoin, a decentralized financial rail designed to function outside of the legacy system, care about a choke point in regulated financial institutions?\n\nCaitlin Long, the founder of Custodia Bank, which is focused on bridging the gap between digital assets and legacy financial services, recognizes that for users in the U.S. to legitimately participate in Bitcoin, the regulatory landscape must be accommodating.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working for years to help enable laws to be enacted, in multiple U.S. states and federally, precisely because in the absence of legal clarity about Bitcoin, legal systems can become attack vectors on Bitcoiners\u201d, she said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAll of us live under legal regimes of some sort, and we should be aware of legal attack vectors and work toward resolving them in an enabling way.\u201d\n\nLong\u2019s advocacy may best represent the potential that favorable or even just equitable financial access could mean for Bitcoin adoption and the advancement of its technology for everyone. Through her work, Custodia (then under the name Avanti) obtained a 2020 bank charter in its home state of Wyoming that made it a special-purpose depository institution capable of custodying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients. But, following a prolonged delay in approval of Custodia\u2019s application for a master account with the Federal Reserve that would allow it to leverage the FedWire network and facilitate large transactions for clients without enrolling intermediaries, Custodia filed a lawsuit against the Fed last year.\n\n\u201cOperation Choke Point 2.0 is real \u2014 Custodia learned about its existence in late January when press leaks hit and reporters started calling Custodia to say they learned that all bank charter applicants at the Fed and OCC with digital assets in their business models, including Custodia, were recently asked to withdraw their pending applications\u201d, Long said. \u201cReporters told us that the Fed\u2019s vote on Custodia\u2019s application would be a foregone conclusion before the Fed governors actually voted.\u201d\n\nBut, more than just stifling innovators who seek to build bridges between Bitcoin and legacy financial services, targeting the choke points of Bitcoin platforms will only push these platforms outside of the scope of regulators, giving those with malicious intent an advantage over those who are attempting to play by the rules.\n\n\u201cInternet-native money exists. It won\u2019t be uninvented\u201d, Long added. \u201cIf federal bank regulators have a prayer of controlling its impact on the traditional U.S. dollar banking system, they will wake up and realize it\u2019s in their interest to enable regulatory-compliant bridges. Otherwise, just as with other industries that the internet has disrupted \u2014 corporate media, for example \u2014 the internet will just go around them and they will face even bigger problems down the road.\u201d\n\nAs was laid bare by the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Bitcoin is still very much tied to the world of cryptocurrency at large in the portfolios of investors and the eyes of most people around the world. Indeed, the revelations around FTX\u2019s criminal operations have been a case in point for regulators who seek the financial prohibition of cryptocurrency businesses. But this very prohibition may have enabled FTX\u2019s operators to fleece billions in customer funds: Based on a Caribbean island, the vast majority of FTX\u2019s business was outside of the jurisdiction of U.S. regulators. As U.S. regulators limit the growth of domestic businesses, offshore alternatives like FTX benefit.\n\nAnd while many Bitcoiners may think that policymakers are powerless to determine the success of this permissionless technology, adverse or absent regulations can limit Bitcoin-specific businesses just as harshly as they do broader, cryptocurrency-related ones. In fact, it may be Bitcoin\u2019s unique properties that make the current regulatory landscape such a daunting one for growth.\n\n\u201cBitcoiners should care about Operation Choke Point 2.0 because certain policymakers are trying to take away our ability to participate in the Bitcoin network\u201d, Morgenstern argued. \u201cMoreover, Bitcoin is different. It is not only the oldest and most tested asset in this space, it is perhaps the only one that everyone agrees is a digital commodity. That means the on-ramp for inclusion into any policy frameworks will have less friction inherently, and Bitcoiners need to understand this.\u201d\n\nRelieving The Choke Points\n\nReviewing the recent, hostile policy updates from federal regulators, it seems clear that Bitcoin is firmly entrenched along with \u201ccrypto\u201d in their minds. And, Bitcoin proponents in particular will agree, many businesses focused on other cryptocurrencies are apt to hurt investors. But some in the Bitcoin sector think that more education could help underscore the distinctions between Bitcoin and altcoins, and better protect Bitcoin from more justified regulatory limits on manipulated tokens and vaporware.\n\n\u201cEngage with your elected officials\u201d, Morgenstern encouraged. \u201cHelp them understand that Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized ledger technology is democratizing finance, creating faster and cheaper transactions and providing much-needed optionality for consumers at a time when the centralized finance system is experiencing distress. This will take time, effort and a lot of communication, but we must work together to help our leaders appreciate how many votes and how much prosperity is at stake.\u201d\n\nIndeed, for those elected officials who do recognize this bias as unduly harmful to innovation, continued advocacy from Bitcoin\u2019s supporters is the best way out of the choke hold.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t an issue where people can afford to be on the sidelines anymore\u201d, Hagerty concluded. \u201cI encourage those who want to see digital assets flourish in the United States to make your voice heard, whether that is at the ballot box or by contacting your lawmakers and urging them to support constructive policy proposals.\u201d\n\nThis article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s \u201cThe Withdrawal Issue\u201d.

        "content": "A Bitcoin (BTC) miner who mistakenly received 20 BTC \u2014 worth over $500,000 \u2014 from crypto exchange Paxos for settling a 0.008 BTC ($200) transaction is now reconsidering their decision to return the jackpot to its rightful owner.\n\nOn Sept. 13, Paxos revealed to Cointelegraph that it overpaid the BTC network fee on Sept. 10, to a miner who goes by the pseudonym Chun.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin dominance tends to influence altcoins, with its pump or slump impacting altcoins differently.\n\nData from IntoTheBlock shows BTC\u2019s correlation with Litecoin is stronger than with Ethereum, while Dollar-pegged USDT tails the list.\n\nA lower correlation is excellent for diversification, offering trading opportunities despite broader market lull where BTC remains range-bound.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is nurturing an uptrend, and with it, several altcoins are moving north. This effect, where the price action of BTC is mirrored or reflected in the price action of another asset, is called correlation. It is often influenced by several factors, including market conditions, investor sentiment, and regulatory developments.\n\nOutside crypto, BTC has a correlation with different assets in the financial playing field, including the US Dollar (USD) and Gold. This explains the narrative, \u201cBitcoin is trading like a tech stock\u201d alongside its often acute inverse relationship with the United States dollar. Read more on this here.\n\nThe correlation with TradFi assets, however, tends to show less consistency compared to crypto. Specifically, while Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with the USD or Gold may change from time to time, it remains rather fixed for most of crypto.\n\nAlso Read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Is BTC ready for a pullback or is it a fake out?\n\nBitcoin correlation with cryptocurrencies\n\nOn-chain analytics and market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has a Bitcoin Correlation Matrix, which shows the lead crypto\u2019s correlation with other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock\u2019s Matrix, BTC has a correlation score of 0.95 with Litecoin (LTC). This is relatively high since the highest possible is 1.00. A correlation of 1.00 means the two cryptos 100% reflect each other\u2019s price changes.\n\nThe lowest correlation possible is -1.00, which means the two variables, or in this case, cryptocurrencies, actually exhibit a 100% negative correlation or move in the exact opposite direction to each other.\n\nA result of 0 means there is no relationship whatsoever between the two variables. BTC also has a high 0.94 correlation to Ethereum (ETH).\n\nBitcoin correlation matrix\n\nSmart investors tend to spread their risk by investing in different cryptocurrencies, as opposed to putting all their money in one basket. This is called \u2018portfolio diversification\u2019. It prevents investors from losing all their money in one go.\n\nIn order to achieve portfolio diversification, it is advised not to invest in highly correlated assets, because a slump affecting one will affect them all, leading to greater losses.\n\nFor investors with large holdings of Bitcoin, therefore, it would be unwise to accumulate too much ETH or LTC. The high correlation with Litecoin is not surprising, in fact, given the altcoin is itself the product of a BTC fork.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart, ETH/USDT 1-day chart, LTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nHow correlation affects portfolio diversification\n\nAccording to portfolio diversification theory investors should steer away from owning too many assets that share a correlation close to 1.0, Assets with a correlation that is as low as -1.0 (perfectly negatively correlated), however, yield maximum risk reduction and should be sought.\n\nCorrelation vs. Risk scale\n\nIt is not possible to find a crypto that is perfectly negatively correlated to Bitcoin. Even stablecoins, which are the least correlated, are nevertheless not negatively correlated to BTC either. The leading one, Tether (USDT), shows a 0.01 correlation. This low correlation explains why USDT tends to get attention when BTC volatility peaks.\n\nBTC correlation with USDT\n\nTraders use USDT to respond to the volatility of Bitcoin. When BTC price goes bearish, they sell, and because they do not want to leave the crypto market entirely, they convert their assets to USDT, before awaiting a market improvement. During such instances, it is possible to note high volumes of USDT move from exchange wallets to private wallets.\n\nWhen markets start improving, the reverse happens, with experienced traders starting to move USDT to exchange wallets in readiness to buy BTC at discounted rates."

Although the SEC\u2019s approval process has been moving slowly, the recent favorable ruling obtained by Grayscale could inspire more ETF applications, as evidenced by the emergence of a new participant in the market.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nBitcoin sees a flurry of ETF filings\n\nRecently, there has been a surge in filings for Bitcoin spot ETFs. BlackRock\u2019s filing on 15 June triggered a wave of new submissions.\n\nBlackRock sought approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF, with Coinbase as the crypto custodian and spot market data provider and BNY Mellon as the cash custodian. On 15 July, the SEC formally accepted BlackRock\u2019s application for review.\n\nFollowing BlackRock, WisdomTree, a New York-based asset manager, filed on 19 July. It\u2019s worth noting that WisdomTree had previously filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. on 8 December 2021, but it was rejected by the SEC in 2022.\n\nSimilarly, asset management firm Valkyrie initially filed a spot Bitcoin ETF application in January 2021, which was rejected. However, they refiled their application on 21 June.\n\nJuly witnessed a flurry of filings, with VanEck, Fidelity/Wise Origin, and Invesco Galaxy submitting their applications to the SEC. Ark Invest was among the earliest institutions to file for a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAdditionally, Frank Templeton recently joined the BTC ETF race. This latest filing has generated considerable excitement in the market.\n\nOn 11 September, Franklin Templeton entered the competitive arena by filing for a Bitcoin spot ETF. This move made them the most recent traditional asset management company to enter this crowded space.\n\nIn their submission to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Franklin Templeton outlined their proposal for an ETF custodied by Coinbase, designed to be traded on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. However, they have yet to put forth a specific ticker symbol for this product.\n\nBitcoin trends as news of another filing hits\n\nThe Templeton application generated a considerable buzz, as noted in a post by Santiment. This post, which tracked the social trends in cryptocurrencies, revealed that the excitement extended beyond just Bitcoin.\n\nIn addition to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash [BCH], a fork of Bitcoin, also garnered significant attention, surpassing BTC in its trending status. The historical trend data also indicated that BCH consistently trended alongside BTC whenever news related to ETF filings emerged.\n\n? #FranklinTempleton has filed for a spot #Bitcoin #ETF, and there is an uptick in crowd optimism. $BTC and its best known fork, $BCH, are the top two trending assets in #crypto. #BitcoinCash, in particular, has benefited from previous ETF announcements. https://t.co/UeSwx9dO3k pic.twitter.com/6DMuPvPG5b \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) September 12, 2023\n\nHow BTC and BCH reacted to the news\n\nThe daily timeframe chart of Bitcoin Cash revealed a notable development on 12 September. The chart indicated that BCH experienced a substantial price surge, surging by more than 7% to reach a closing price of $198.5.\n\nAs of this writing, BCH continued to trade with a modest increase of over 1%, hovering around the $201 mark.\n\nFurthermore, this price increase had a noticeable effect on its Relative Strength Index (RSI). As of this writing, the RSI had risen above the neutral line, indicating an uptrend in BCH\u2019s price momentum.\n\nOn 12 September, Bitcoin also experienced an uptrend according to its daily timeframe chart, although the price increase was relatively modest compared to BCH. The chart indicated that BTC\u2019s price gained over 2%, closing trading at slightly above $25,800.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nAt press time, it was trading at approximately $26,000, reflecting a further increase of over 1%.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that unlike Bitcoin Cash, this uptrend did not pull Bitcoin out of its bearish trend. The RSI indicated it was still trending below the neutral line at press time, suggesting ongoing bearish sentiment in the market."

In essence, this means that Bitcoin has become a more significant player in the market, overshadowing its competitors.\n\nAdditionally, whale interest in Bitcoin was on the rise. The number of addresses holding significant amounts of the cryptocurrency reached new highs. This trend can have both positive and negative implications for the market.\n\nOn the one hand, it indicated growing confidence among large investors. On the other hand, it raised concerns about the concentration of wealth within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n? #Bitcoin $BTC Number of Addresses Holding 1+ Coins just reached an ATH of 1,020,176 Previous ATH of 1,020,156 was observed on 10 September 2023 View metric:https://t.co/s7tx1xxyz3 pic.twitter.com/Nhq7NyST5w \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) September 14, 2023\n\nRetail interest was also surging, with a record number of addresses holding smaller amounts of BTC. This increased retail participation can impact market dynamics. It suggests that Bitcoin is becoming more accessible and appealing to everyday investors, potentially driving further adoption.\n\nActive addresses on the network also surged, hitting a four-month high. This uptick in activity can indicate growing interest and engagement within the community. It means more people are actively using Bitcoin, which can be a sign of a healthy and vibrant ecosystem.\n\n? #Bitcoin $BTC Number of Active Addresses (7d MA) just reached a 4-month high of 59,829.149 Previous 4-month high of 59,694.798 was observed on 13 September 2023 View metric:https://t.co/SUxtdZ0Wuc pic.twitter.com/mgT3fDvdtj \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) September 14, 2023\n\nHowever, some metrics like the MVRV ratio and long-short difference have declined. These indicators suggest that short-term holders may be increasing in number. This could lead to more volatility in the market, as short-term traders tend to react quickly to price fluctuations.\n\nWhat are traders doing?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s open interest fell which could affect trading dynamics and market sentiment. A decrease in open interest can imply reduced speculative activity or uncertainty in the market.

        "content": "As long-time readers will know, I have been encouraging readers to buy Bitcoin since 2013. I continue to do so. Everybody should own some Bitcoin. Its potential is too enormous to ignore, and I feel a percentage of everybody\u2019s portfolio should be allocated to it. If I had a Bitcoin for every person who has come up to me and said how they should have bought it when they first heard me talking about it, but didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be richer than Bitcoin\u2019s founders.\n\nBy owning bitcoin you are effectively owning shares in perhaps the most technologically brilliant system of money in history. The technology is already becoming the template for national currencies in the form of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) but as supranational money for the borderless medium\n\nthat is the internet, and with its capacity for micropayments, bitcoin\u2019s potential scalability dwarfs that of national currencies.\n\nWith its finite supply, it has the potential to become a widespread online-savings vehicle for both individuals and corporations. Bitcoin benefits from its incredibly robust blockchain (the digital ledger that underpins the cryptocurrency). It is well-established as the first and foremost cryptocurrency, making it easier to expand its network. Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network, a blockchain-based technology, makes Bitcoin transactions incredibly quick.\n\nSubscribe to MoneyWeek Subscribe to MoneyWeek today and get your first six magazine issues absolutely FREE Get 6 issues free Sign up to Money Morning Don't miss the latest investment and personal finances news, market analysis, plus money-saving tips with our free twice-daily newsletter Don't miss the latest investment and personal finances news, market analysis, plus money-saving tips with our free twice-daily newsletter Sign up\n\nGiven all this, in a world of artificial intelligence (AI) and automated payments, it has the potential to become the default cash system for the internet, the standard on which internet monies, from the M-Pesa to Air Miles, are based. Why not have a piece of that potential pie?\n\nIf I look at the combined average IQ of people in the Bitcoin sector and compare it with, say, gold mining, there is no contest. Bitcoin abounds with brain boxes. By owning Bitcoin, you are effectively leveraging this extraordinarily high combined IQ.\n\nI don\u2019t think it is going to the moon tomorrow. Bitcoin tends to go through a cycle. The first phase I call \u201cquiet accumulation\u201d, which is followed by \u201cfrenzy and a blow-off top\u201d. Thirdly, there is the \u201cmonster correction\u201d. Finally, we reach a stage of \u201cfrustrating consolidation\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re somewhere in phase four or one, although such phases can last a long time. But news broke a fortnight ago of what could prove a landmark court ruling for bitcoin. The Financial Times, traditionally sceptical about Bitcoin, called it \u201ca big win\u201d.\n\nLegal imbroglios\n\nThe decision concerned the Greyscale Bitcoin Trust which was listed in the US in 2013 and buys and holds Bitcoin. So in buying the trust investors are, in effect, buying Bitcoin, or at least getting exposure to the Bitcoin price. Greyscale now has something like $17bn under management.\n\nHowever, investors cannot sell their shares and redeem them for Bitcoin. They can only sell them to someone else. This means in effect that the trust cannot sell its Bitcoin: the amount of Bitcoin in the trust can only increase (as it issues more shares). At first the trust traded at a considerable premium to the Bitcoin price: it was the only way investors could own Bitcoin via a broker. At times Greyscale traded at double the value of its Bitcoin holdings. However, in recent years this reversed, so that by December last year the trust was trading at a 50% discount to the Bitcoin price. What was the point of owning the trust then, if it doesn\u2019t track the Bitcoin price?\n\nGreyscale had a problem. The solution was to convert the trust into an exchange-traded fund , so it would be able to buy and sell Bitcoin according to the market\u2019s demand, thus accurately tracking the price. For years Greyscale has been trying to get permission. But the US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), rejected its application.\n\nA question of balance\n\nThe SEC has repeatedly ruled against other Bitcoin ETF applications too. There have been so many. The Winklevoss brothers tried to get one listed. So did Cathie Wood. They were all rejected. There are at least half a dozen other proposals under consideration from the likes of BlackRock, WisdomTree and Fidelity. But it is clear that the SEC, like the UK\u2019s City regulator, the FCA, does not like crypto. Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, has issued a plethora of regulatory actions against the likes of Coinbase and Binance. The latter is the largest crypto exchange in the world.\n\nTo be balanced, the SEC has approved ETFs based on Bitcoin futures. But it has argued, not so unreasonably given its remit, that bitcoin trades on unregulated exchanges and can be prone to market manipulation.\n\nA fortnight ago, however, a federal appeal court in Washington ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject the Bitcoin ETF application Greyscale brought last year. \u201cThe denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products,\u201d said one of the three judges. The Grayscale appeal focused on one simple question: whether it could offer a spot Bitcoin ETF that would expose retail investors to the real-time price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe fact is that there is a lot of demand for a Bitcoin spot ETF, not just in the US but worldwide. We shall see if the SEC now appeals, but the upshot is that a spot bitcoin ETF now looks a lot more likely. An ETF will open up entirely new markets for bitcoin both at the retail and the institutional level. It will bring a lot more money into Bitcoin. With Bitcoin limited supply, that has to be very bullish.\n\nWith a Bitcoin ETF in the US, the FCA here in the UK will almost certainly have to reevaluate its anti-crypto stance, which has made it so difficult for UK investors to invest in this sector via traditional brokers. We shall see.\n\nThis article was first published in MoneyWeek's magazine.

        "content": "\"Early in 2023, we recognized the opportunity to establish a Bitcoin-only custodian, combining the unique capabilities of each company and supporting the innovators that will be at the forefront of pushing Bitcoin adoption.\" Post this\n\nBitGo and Swan Bitcoin today announced plans to create the first Bitcoin-only trust company, pending regulatory approval. The new joint venture will combine BitGo's best-in-class Bitcoin cold storage technology and regulatory compliance expertise with Swan's industry-leading capabilities in onboarding, fraud prevention, AML/KYC, and dedicated Bitcoin experts.\n\nBitGo CEO Mike Belshe said, \"We believe the best model for the Bitcoin industry is the same battle-tested model that has been part of the US financial industry for over a century: the separation of exchange and custody. Our teams have worked closely together for nearly a year on stronger qualified custody models. Early in 2023, we recognized the opportunity to establish a Bitcoin-only custodian, combining the unique capabilities of each company and supporting the innovators that will be at the forefront of pushing Bitcoin adoption.\"\n\n\"We immediately saw the vision,\" said Cory Klippsten, Swan's CEO. \"For years, we've heard from major clients, partners, and other Bitcoin companies that they would prefer a Bitcoin-only software and services stack that is focused strictly on the best custody that leverages Bitcoin's unique features. It's important to us to build a custodian without the risks of securing many altcoins within the same trust company as Bitcoin. We want to do our part to build a dedicated ecosystem for Bitcoin, separate from industry speculators, to allow for innovation in custodial offerings.\"\n\nBoth BitGo and Swan are thriving in the longest-ever Bitcoin bear market. BitGo recently closed a $100 million fundraising round at a $1.75 billion valuation. Swan has already seen significant revenue growth in 2023 and projects another 50% increase by year-end to more than $75 million annualized.\n\nSwan is committed to addressing the complex issue of custody, which it considers the most challenging issue for Bitcoin holders. In addition to the new partnership with BitGo, Swan acquired Specter Solutions in 2022 and will unveil Swan Vault, a retail-facing multisig custody solution, in October.\n\nTo learn more follow @Swan and @BitGo.\n\nAbout BitGo:\n\nBitGo provides the most secure and scalable wallet solutions for the digital asset economy, offering regulated custody, staking and trading, and core infrastructure to investors and builders alike.\n\nFounded in 2013, BitGo pioneered the multi-signature wallet and is the first digital asset company to focus exclusively on serving institutional clients.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAmid widespread international expansion from crypto companies, Canadian Bitcoin exchange Bull Bitcoin announced a commercial foray into Costa Rica this week. The company became the first Bitcoin enterprise to tap into SINPE Movil, the country\u2019s primary payment provider, offering a Bitcoin on-and-off-ramp.\n\nAided by a Bitcoin circular economy project dubbed the Bitcoin Jungle, users will be able to buy and sell BTC with the country\u2019s national currency (col\u00f3n) through the project\u2019s digital wallet. To swap col\u00f3nes into BTC or vice versa, Costa Ricans and tourists can download the Bitcoin Jungle wallet, create a username, and select the SINPE Movil option.\n\nSINPE Movil, the Spanish acronym for National System for Electronic Payments, is run and operated by the Costa Rican Central Bank and uses a similar model to the Kenyan M-Pesa. Users are allowed to send and receive money via mobile phone numbers, instantaneously.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to local media outlets, more than 60% of the country uses the service, with the system transacting the equivalent of 17% of the country\u2019s GDP at one point. The service is not a dedicated app, but instead operates as an interbank settlement service, much like Zelle in the United States or Interac in Canada.\n\n\u201cSINPE Movil integration is a game changer,\u201d said Francis Pouliot, founder and CEO of Bull Bitcoin, \u201cbecause everyone in Costa Rica uses it.\u201d\n\nHe told Decrypt that \u201cit's simple and transactions are instant,\u201d and described it as an \u201calmost magical experience\u201d due to the ability to send money \u201cfrom anywhere in the world to a Costa Rican's phone number within seconds, at very low cost.\u201d\n\nBull Bitcoin is the first and only exchange in Costa Rica to allow Bitcoin <-> Colones conversion using the national fiat mobile payment system, allowing instant low-cost access for millions of Costa Ricans and an off-ramp for tourists and businesses \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf7\ud83d\udc02https://t.co/pcdW3YdVyz \u2014 FRANCIS \u2623\ufe0f BULLBITCOIN.COM (@francispouliot_) September 12, 2023\n\nAccording to Pouliot, a Canadian national who has lived in Costa Rica for three years, the country is \u201cfairly banked\u201d thanks to SINPE Movil.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor Lee Salminen, the founder of Bitcoin Jungle\u2014Bull Bitcoin\u2019s local partner\u2014the partnership allows the company key insight into Latin America.\n\n\u201cBeing on the ground in Costa Rica provides a unique opportunity to experiment in real-time,\u201d he told Decrypt, \u201cwith ground-level insight into its impact and adoption.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Jungle has been paving the way for a Bitcoin circular economy in what\u2019s known as Costa Rica\u2019s Golden Triangle. Comprising five communities\u2014Dominical, Uvita, Ojochal, Platanillo, and Tinamaste\u2014it aims to replicate what Bitcoin Beach has done in El Salvador.\n\nPouliot concluded that the integration into SINPE Movil \u201csolves the biggest obstacle for Bitcoin adoption in Costa Rica\u2014the absence of infrastructure that lets businesses and individuals move money from the Bitcoin network into the traditional financial system.\u201d"

For 50 years we\u2019ve said we\u2019re great property and sharemarket investors, but the issue is the money supply has grown 8 per cent year-on-year and these assets are just keeping pace with the amount of new money in the economy, so all you\u2019re really seeing is a crash, but a crash higher in asset prices.\u201d\n\nAt lunchtime on Thursday, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency widely regarded as a risk and liquidity bellwether changed hands for $US26,280 to mark a 9.9 per cent fall over the past month.\n\nMixed record\n\nIris floated at $US28 a share at the peak of the cryptocurrency bubble in November 2021, but its valued has since crashed 84.2 per cent.

        "content": "The Karnataka High Court has asked a special investigation team (SIT) probing a Bitcoin scam during the previous BJP government\u2019s tenure not to take precipitative action against a police officer in a case registered over alleged tampering of electronic evidence seized at the start of the case in 2020.\n\nThe police officer, Sridhar Poojar, was the investigating officer in the 2020 case against hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki, 28, and his associates. Poojar has sought the quashing of an FIR filed last month by the CID against unnamed Bengaluru police officials for allegedly tampering with electronic evidence seized from Sriki and his associates.\n\nThe high court on September 12 asked SIT officials not to take any \u201caction in the absence of any incriminating material against the petitioner\u201d till October 9 when the case is listed for hearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe CID had filed an FIR on August 8, 2023, for alleged tampering of evidence against officials of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) unit of the Bengaluru police that had investigated Sriki between 2020 and 2022. An officer of the rank of a deputy superintendent of police, K Ravishankar, who is a part of the Bitcoin scam probe SIT, filed a case of destruction of documents and cheating against unnamed officers of its sister unit, the CCB, in connection with the alleged manipulation of electronic devices seized from Sriki and his associates.\n\nThe CID has quoted a digital forensics report dated February 20, 2023, to state that two pen drives seized from the accused on November 9, 2020, at the time of the first batch of arrests had been manipulated in police custody, and that a MacBook and a hard disk seized on November 17, 2020, were found to have been tampered between November 18 and 20. A second MacBook seized on November 19, 2020, was allegedly tampered with between November 20 and 21.\n\nThe electronic and computer devices were tampered with at the premises of the CCB office in Bengaluru between November 9 and December 12, 2020, the CID has alleged in its complaint against the CCB to the Bengaluru police.\n\nPoojar has denied the allegations in his petition.\n\nThe alleged Bitcoin scam case involving Sriki and his associates has been at the centre of a political controversy in Karnataka with the Congress alleging that top leaders of the state BJP and police officials received kickbacks in cryptocurrency after the arrest of the accused in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn June 30 this year, the Karnataka police functioning under the new Congress government ordered the creation of the SIT to probe the Bitcoin scam.\n\nIn statements given to the police, Sriki has claimed that he gave away Bitcoins that were in his possession to the police following his arrest in 2020. \u201cI understood the case scenario that even if I do not give them the Bitcoins they can use forensic methods to find the Bitcoins after a talk with the investigating officer. So post consultations, I voluntarily accepted (sic) to give away the Bitcoins which I had kept in various wallets in different cryptocurrencies,\u201d reads a statement attributed to Sriki, which is a part of the chargesheet in one of the cases filed against the hacker in 2021.\n\nIn November 2020, the Central Crime Branch of the Bengaluru police had stumbled on the suspected possession of a large quantity of Bitcoin by the hacker Srikrishna following his arrest in a case of procuring drugs over the darknet using cryptocurrency.\n\nThe investigations in the drug case led to the CCB filing cases against Sriki and his associates for allegedly hacking online poker sites and cryptocurrency exchanges to acquire wealth through illegal means.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSriki\u2019s arrest also revealed his role in a July 2019 hacking of the state e-procurement cell where Rs 11.5 crore was stolen. Sriki told the police that he was involved in stealing cryptocurrency from international sites, including virtual crypto exchanges like the Bitfinex exchange.\n\nWhile Rs 1.43 crore of the Rs 11.5 crore stolen from the e-procurement cell has been recovered by the Enforcement Directorate, there has been no other major recovery of stolen funds or cryptocurrency that was allegedly stolen by the gang from crypto exchanges."

This is less convenient than buying it on the open market because you can only purchase the exact amount the other person is willing to sell, and they set the price.\n\nBeware that P2P platforms have their own unique set of risks.\n\nP2P communication. Some P2P platforms allow interaction between traders. If you\u2019re communicating directly with another trader, never share personal information \u2013 phishing and other scams are common in crypto.\n\nSome P2P platforms allow interaction between traders. If you\u2019re communicating directly with another trader, never share personal information \u2013 phishing and other scams are common in crypto. Incorrectly approved transactions. If you\u2019re selling on a P2P platform, you must release your assets once payment has been received. If you release your funds before receiving payment, they may be irreversibly lost.\n\nIf you\u2019re selling on a P2P platform, you must release your assets once payment has been received. If you release your funds before receiving payment, they may be irreversibly lost. Price volatility. When buying and selling on a P2P trading platform, it is your responsibility to check prices before completing transactions. If the market has moved and you haven\u2019t adjusted your order, your buy or sell order may be filled at an unfavorable price.\n\nWhy don\u2019t more exchanges offer PayPal?\n\nThis is mainly due to one simple fact: PayPal supports chargebacks, which is a problem when purchasing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is because Bitcoin and other crypto transactions are irreversible.\n\nAs a result, someone could theoretically buy Bitcoin with PayPal, complain that they never received the BTC they purchased and ask for a chargeback. That way scammers can keep their money and essentially get Bitcoin for free.\n\nBecause of this heightened risk of fraud, there are only a handful of crypto trading platforms and exchanges that accept PayPal deposits.\n\nIs there any risk buying Bitcoin with PayPal?\n\nThere are always risks involved with buying and selling Bitcoin, but none specific to using PayPal as a deposit method.\n\nOnce you've purchased your Bitcoin, consider moving it off the platform you bought it on and into a non-custodial wallet to reduce counter-party risks.\n\nPros and cons of buying crypto with PayPal\n\nPros If you already have a PayPal account, payment is quick and convenient\n\nSafe and secure payment method\n\nAllows you to buy crypto with Australian dollars (AUD) Cons Only supported by a small number of platforms\n\nMay not be able to withdraw your funds back to your PayPal account\n\nForeign exchange fees apply on some platforms\n\nBottom line\n\nYou can use your PayPal account to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on a small number of trading platforms in Australia. The fees on these platforms are a bit higher than some other exchanges out there, but they by no means break the bank.\n\nYou can also use PayPal on a P2P market via an exchange like KuCoin, but these are much more inconvenient than buying Bitcoin from a trading platform normally.\n\nAs PayPal looks to explore cryptocurrency further, you may not have to wait long until you can buy Bitcoin from within the PayPal app in Australia.\n\nCompare platforms that accept PayPal\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I buy Bitcoin with PayPal on Coinbase? No, Coinbase does not currently accept PayPal transfers. At the time of writing, the only supported payment methods for Australian buyers are debit card or bank deposit.\n\nCan I buy Bitcoin through PayPal anonymously? Not really. While there are some platforms that allow you to buy cryptocurrency without providing any proof of ID, PayPal isn\u2019t an anonymous payment method. This is due to the fact that you\u2019ll need to fund your PayPal account from a linked bank account or credit card, which will in turn be linked to your identity.\n\nIs it possible to cash out BTC to PayPal? Yes. One option is to sell Bitcoin through a peer-to-peer marketplace that accepts PayPal, such as LocalBitcoins or Paxful, or place a trade on an exchange like VirWox. Another alternative is to use an exchange where you can sell Bitcoin for AUD, then withdraw your dollars to the credit card or bank account linked to your PayPal balance.\n\nCan I store Bitcoin in my PayPal wallet? No, you can\u2019t fund your PayPal wallet with Bitcoin and BTC cannot be stored in your PayPal wallet. Your BTC will instead need to be held in a dedicated cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nAre there other ways to buy cryptocurrency with Australian dollars? Yes, there are several crypto exchanges that offer fiat-to-crypto trading and accept deposits via bank account transfer, BPAY, POLi Payments, credit card, debit card and even cash.\n\nCan you buy Bitcoin with the PayPal app? PayPal now offers the ability to purchase Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies through the PayPal app, however, this feature is not available to residents outside of the US. PayPal has not announced any plans to rollout the feature in Australia."

        "title": "10 expert Bitcoin price predictions for 2024 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Although Bitcoin (BTC) has been going through a bit of a stagnation lately, along with the majority of the cryptocurrency market, quite a few experts are bullish about its long-term future, with the most optimistic prognoses for the maiden cryptocurrency going as high as $1 million.\n\nAs it happens, the author of the book \u201cUndressing Bitcoin,\u201d marketing consultant and podcast host Layah Heilpern, listed ten finance and investment experts and companies, along with their predictions for the price of Bitcoin in the future, in an X post shared on September 14.\n\nSpecifically, Heilpern started off with billionaire investor and venture capitalist Tim Draper, who had originally predicted that Bitcoin would reach the price of $250,000 by June 2023 but has later pushed back his prognosis for 2025, stating he hadn\u2019t expected the United States regulators to be so aggressive.\n\n$1 million in play?\n\nMeanwhile, one of the early pioneers in the cryptocurrency field and CEO of blockchain company Blockstream, Adam Back, stated in August that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 before the 2024 halving, the same number as offered by Robert Kiyosaki, who more recently said Bitcoin could even soar to $1 million if the world economy crashed.\n\nAt the same time, $1 million by 2030 is the price target for Bitcoin, also predicted by Cathie Wood, the CEO of global asset manager ARK Investment Management, back in June 2023, having reiterated that \u201cBitcoin is a hedge against inflation\u201d \u2013 a view shared by many other experts.\n\nIn July, Mike Novogratz, the CEO of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital, said Bitcoin would undoubtedly reach $500,000 in the next five years or so due to its adoption pace and unique features, such as being \u201ctailor-made to being an anti-inflation store of value.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee believes that Bitcoin is heading toward $180,000 by the end of 2024, particularly if the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nArthur Hayes, the co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, sees $70,000, slightly above Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high (ATH) of $69,045 from November 202, as the most likely scenario in a rally triggered by the possible decision of the US Federal Reserve on cutting interest rates, as he wrote in his digest on September 12.\n\nWhat companies say\n\nOn the other hand, investment banking and asset management giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) is a bit more conservative in its estimation, projecting $45,000 as a bull case scenario price for Bitcoin, provided it equals gold in risk capital or volume-adjusted terms in investors\u2019 portfolios.\n\nThat said, in its recent \u201cBlockchain Letter,\u201d published on August 22, the team at Pantera Capital, one of the leading names in crypto asset management, highlighted its bullish outlook for 2024 and projected that Bitcoin could rise to around $148,000 in its next four-year halving cycle if past trends hold.\n\nIn the meantime, Standard Chartered, one of the leading international banks in the United Kingdom that offers Bitcoin and crypto custody in the European Union through its subsidiary, Zodia Custody, has recently boosted its original $100,000 end-2024 forecast for Bitcoin to $120,000.\n\nFinally, Heilpern added her own forecast of $75,000 for the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset to the list, proceeding to place the timeline for achieving this price target at some point in 2025 in the comments.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Bitcoin is currently changing hands at $26,631, up 1.07% on the day and growing 3.07% across the past week, while still recording losses of 8.68% on its monthly chart, as per the latest information retrieved on September 15.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAll things considered, time will tell which of the above prognoses \u2013 ranging from a modest (at this point) $45,000 to a whopping $1 million per unit of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency \u2013 was the most correct (if any).\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been locked in a relentless struggle, teetering above and below the $26,000 mark over the past few weeks.\n\nYet, a glimmer of hope emerged on September 14 when reports broke out that BTC achieved a significant milestone, which could pave the way for the cryptocurrency to regain its status as a payment option at Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), bringing a fresh wave of optimism to the crypto community.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s rewind a bit.\n\nIn February 2021, Tesla disclosed a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin \u201cto further diversify and maximize returns on\u201d its cash reserves. In addition, the world\u2019s biggest electric carmaker announced its plan to begin accepting BTC as a payment method, making it the first major auto manufacturer to do so.\n\nHowever, the hype was short-lived. Just a few months later, Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla made a U-turn and said it would suspend vehicle purchases using BTC, citing worries over the rising use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and trading.\n\n\u201cTesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about the rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.\u201d \u2013 the company stated at the time.\n\nNotably, Musk then said that Tesla would restart Bitcoin payments after BTC miners\u2019 clean energy use outstrips 50%. Remarkably, this condition has now been reportedly met, potentially marking a pivotal moment.\n\nBitcoin clean energy usage is now over 50%\n\nOn Thursday, September 14, Bloomberg analyst Jamie Coutts revealed in an X (Twitter) thread that the percentage of Bitcoin mining energy stemming from renewable sources had exceeded 50% due to \u201cfalling emissions plus a dramatically rising hash rate.\u201d\n\nThe move comes after Bitcoin miners started fleeing China following the nation\u2019s ban on mining in 2021. Furthermore, other countries forayed into crypto mining to \u201cmonetize stranded and excess energy,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nWhat does this mean for BTC price?\n\nWell, it is still too early to come to conclusions. Still, if Elon Musk brings back BTC payments thanks to growing clean energy use, it could result in a fresh surge in bullish pressure in the leading crypto asset, particularly among institutional investors.\n\nBut regardless of Musk and Tesla, Bitcoin\u2019s clean energy usage exceeding 50% nevertheless represents a significant milestone for the digital asset as it could garner the attention of other environmentally-friendly investors and companies.\n\nAt the time of writing on September 15, BTC was changing hands at $26,634, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours.\n\nBTC 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe cryptocurrency advanced 1.7% on the weekly chart while losing almost 10% on the month. Year-to-date, its gains remain strong at over 60%.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative.

        "content": "With the majority of the cryptocurrency market slowly moving to reverse the losses suffered in the previous dip, Bitcoin (BTC) is no different, and cryptocurrency experts agree that more price gains, perhaps even a new all-time high (ATH), could be in store.\n\nIndeed, pseudonymous crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade said that the next target for Bitcoin could be $46,000, based on the linear chart that has demonstrated a similar track in the period between 2018 and 2021, according to the analysis shared on September 15.\n\nBitcoin linear chart analysis. Source: Trader Tardigrade\n\nNew record in the making?\n\nEarlier, the crypto expert projected that the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset would witness a \u201cparabolic rally\u201d and perhaps even reach a new record, stating that Bitcoin \u201chas never lost its track\u201d and that the \u201cnew Bitcoin ATH is brewing in this post-Shakeout Bull Run.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, in the most recent post on social media, he highlighted that $30,000 would be a foundation for Bitcoin\u2019s takeoff toward the new ATH. Specifically, as he explained:\n\n\u201cBefore reaching ATH, BTC will pullback to $30k. $30k will be the new floor!!\u201d\n\nAt the same time, a renowned crypto trading expert Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe stressed that Bitcoin \u201cmight be ready to start the bull cycle\u201d if it \u201cholds above the 200-week [exponential moving average (EMA)], and it should hold above that level,\u201d arguing that \u201cit\u2019s the best period of the cycle to accumulate your altcoins.\u201d\n\nBitcoin price action analysis.
