        "content": "It's helpful to view these numbers in the context of their year-to-date performance, where Bitcoin has gained an impressive 64%, and Ether has risen by 41%. This underscores the resilience of these cryptocurrencies as some of the top-performing assets in 2023. This quarterly outperformance of BTC versus ETH and the broader CMI is a continuation of a trend we\u2019ve seen throughout the year. Institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs continues to support BTC, while the continued regulatory pressure on alternative tokens drives the bifurcation in the crypto market between the established majors (Bitcoin and Ether) and other digital asset protocols and projects."

        "content": "Bitcoin now makes up just under half of the $1 trillion crypto market, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nIn January, Bitcoin\u2019s market share stood at about 38%, according to Bloomberg, but it has since jumped to 48.5% as investors have fled some alternative coins in favor of the perceived safety of the original cryptocurrency.\n\nThe ongoing trial of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has drawn attention to the pitfalls of bad actors in the crypto industry, but it hasn\u2019t stopped investors from slowly putting more money into digital assets, which could see even greater investor interest because of rising geopolitical risk.\n\nAbout $78 million poured into digital asset investment products last week, the largest inflows since July, according to a report from CoinShares. Bitcoin received the majority of that investment, with $43 million in inflows over the week.\n\nHowever, Ether, the second most popular cryptocurrency, saw lackluster investment last week, according to CoinShares, even as six futures-based Ethereum ETFs launched in the U.S. In total, the new ETFs brought in just $10 million from investors. Ether\u2019s market dominance has also fallen to about 17% from 19% in January.\n\nComparatively, the first Bitcoin futures ETFs\u2014launched in the U.S. in 2021\u2014brought in $1 billion, although the CoinShares report noted that investor interest in digital currencies was much higher at that point compared to now.\n\nA bright spot for alternative currencies last week was inflows to Solana, a coin that was heavily endorsed by Bankman-Fried. The cryptocurrency notched its highest weekly inflows since March 2022, at $24 million, according to CoinShares.\n\nBitcoin and Ether were both down less than 1% on Tuesday afternoon. Bitcoin was trading around $27,300 and Ether around $1,500, according to CoinGecko."

        "title": "Israel-Palestine Conflict: Bitcoin and Gold's Reaction to War Following Ukraine Invasion - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe Israel-Hamas conflict has not affected the Bitcoin market.\n\nRegardless of local political unrest, cryptos can operate globally according to the fundamental decentralization idea.\n\nExtended crises due to government borrowing or money printing may boost BTC\u2019s appeal as an inflation hedge.\n\nThe Israel war\u2019s impact on BTC price is uncertain, with traders drawing parallels to the uncertainty during the Ukraine conflict in February 2022.\n\nThe world has become more aware of the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East due to the recent Israel-Palestine conflict . While the unrest has wide-ranging effects, one aspect often considered a safe haven in times of unrest has remained unaffected: the stability of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price.\n\nAdaptability of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has demonstrated resilience in its price despite the rising violence and the significant effects the conflict in the Middle East has had on the lives of both Israelis and Palestinians. The price of the digital asset fluctuated very little over the course of the weekend as the conflict developed. This went against some predictions and assertions people held.\n\nBTC was trading at around $28,000 just hours after Israel formally proclaimed a state of war. This represents a 0.20% decrease in value over the last 24 hours.\n\nIn the past, big market reactions have frequently been brought on by geopolitical crises. Bitcoin, on the other hand, seems to be an exception to this trend, as it showed a similar pattern during the present crisis and was largely untouched during the brief Israeli-Gaza conflict in 2021.\n\nThe Gaza Factor\n\nGaza has a population of about two million people and has been severely damaged by the war. Although it would be expected to have some degree of Bitcoin adoption, due to its relatively tiny population, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the market for cryptocurrencies worldwide.\n\nHamas, a Palestinian Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist organization involved in the conflict, has even asked for donations in Bitcoin before, but the volume of these transactions was insufficient to have a meaningful impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price. This begs the question of whether variables outside the scope of the conflict\u2019s impact may be responsible for Bitcoin\u2019s immunity to geopolitical instability.\n\nThe Financial Importance of Bitcoin\n\nThe financial importance of Bitcoin may be one reason for its lack of interest in the Israel-Palestine issue. Even if the tension has clearly caused personal misery and unrest, it is debatably not currently a financial concern on a global or cryptocurrency level.\n\nSince it is a decentralized digital money, national economies and conventional financial institutions do not influence how Bitcoin functions.\n\nHowever, it should be highlighted that the conflict\u2019s financial effects are unknown for the foreseeable future. The length, cost, and potential means of funding the war could have an impact on cryptocurrency markets as well as other international financial markets.\n\nOne of the first reactions came from the crypto analyst Michael Van de Poppe, who expects the market to be volatile this week. He asserted that it is likely that Bitcoin will continue to rise, possibly reaching $30,000 as global uncertainty grows.\n\nI\u2019ve had an amazing business trip to Dubai. Can\u2019t wait to share news! Now; market perspective it\u2019s going to be a volatile week. My idea is that #Bitcoin continues the upwards grind & potentially reaches $30K as worldwide uncertainty grows. Stop the war. \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) October 7, 2023\n\nAccording to on-chain analytics company Santiment , there has been a big shift in the Bitcoin market as over 10,000 $BTC have left exchanges, the greatest amount since September 7.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin is trying to reach the $28,000 market value. The significance of utility cannot be understated, particularly in light of the recent decline in unique addresses.\n\n\ud83d\udcca #Bitcoin had its most coins (over 10K $BTC ) moving off exchanges since September 7th, and #crypto 's top market cap asset is making a 2nd run at crossing a $28K market value. Utility will be important here, as unique addresses have fallen to 6-week lows. https://t.co/JoJv9YYJsA pic.twitter.com/3JELGuzJRG \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 8, 2023\n\nWar and Commodities Reemerging On the Crypto Radar\n\nBitcoin\u2019s reaction might vary if the incident continues for a long time and costs the people concerned a lot of money. To pay for expenses, governments might resort to borrowing money or printing money, which could cause inflation and undermine trust in fiat currencies.\n\nIn such a case, interest in and investment in Bitcoin, sometimes touted as a hedge against inflation and economic instability, could surge. Bitcoin\u2019s price might rise because investors use it as a store of value to guard against currency depreciation and economic uncertainty.\n\nHowever, when it comes to price catalysts, traders in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets believe that the majority of volatility is still to come due to the ongoing Israel war.\n\nCrypto trader Jelle compared this situation with the start of the war in Ukraine by saying he was unsure of what would happen to BTC/USD after the war in Ukraine in February 2022 because of Bitcoin\u2019s response to that event.\n\nGetting quite a few questions about this; I don't know. All I do know is that the Ukraine war triggered an 8% down candle, that was erased within a day. I'm much more concerned with the unnecessary loss of life than by the potential effects on the market.#Bitcoin https://t.co/FPjD86HqYh pic.twitter.com/sCYBKU0npS \u2014 Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) October 9, 2023\n\nBitcoin, Gold and Oil\n\nIn the meantime, Mike McGlone, senior macro strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, said traders are currently demonstrating a \u201crisk-off tilt\u201d towards Bitcoin.\n\n#Bitcoin showing risk off tilt in the aftermath of Hamas-Israel escalation. My bias is the downward sloping 100-week moving average is likely to win the battle vs. the up trending 50-week. Spiking #crudeoil is a liquidity pressure factor. @BBGIntelligence pic.twitter.com/UYDcqc03Z2 \u2014 Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) October 8, 2023\n\nMcGlone mentioned a macro asset phenomenon that was developing, with gold up 1% on the day and Brent crude up 3.25% ahead of the opening of Wall Street.\n\nIn a Pavlovian reaction to the conflict between Israel and Palestine, gold prices jumped. As investors hurried to invest in safe havens like gold, bonds, and US dollars, the yellow metal acquired luster.\n\nToday\u2019s session saw a rise in gold of around 1%. In challenging times like these, gold might be a beneficiary if it turns into a regional war with the involvement of other nations and any disruptions to the oil supply.\n\nPopular trader Skew described BTC price behavior as \u201cilliquid and choppy,\u201d adding that \u201cmarkets are reacting quite defensively,\u201d pointing to a fresh rise in the U.S. dollar index (DXY), which was up 0.4% on its own.\n\n$BTC 4H\n\nthese wicks really say how illiquid & choppy price action is pic.twitter.com/Qq13GsuqfB \u2014 Skew \u0394 (@52kskew) October 9, 2023\n\nThe DXY index reached its highest levels last week since late 2022.\n\nRussia \u2013 Ukraine War Comparison\n\nDigital tools have substantially impacted the battle in Ukraine. It is one of the most extensively documented military operations in history and the first significant cyberwar between two nations. The war has also featured the widespread use of crypto.\n\nAccording to Elliptic , a blockchain analytics company, as the conflict enters its second year, more than $212 million worth of cryptocurrencies have been given to support pro-Ukrainian war operations. This includes the direct transfer to the Ukrainian government of almost $80 million in cryptocurrency.\n\nVarious war activities have reportedly been funded with cryptocurrency, according to Ukrainian officials and government fundraising websites. The products bought vary from helmets and protective vests to drones and demining tools. Other cryptocurrency donations have gone towards purchasing radios and medical supplies as well as infrastructure.\n\nOn the other hand, reports from Chainalysis show there were volunteer organizations and their followers who have used social media to crowdfund the procurement of weapons and disseminate misinformation by asking for cryptocurrency donations. The report has shown these groups have received over $2.2 million in cryptocurrencies, mostly in the form of Bitcoin and Ether donations. Tether, Litecoin, and Dogecoin have all been sent in sizable amounts as well."

        "content": "The most popular smart contract solutions in crypto are based on Ethereum, which provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s primary use case is as a store of value \u2014 digital gold \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, for payments, exemplified by the Lightning Network.\n\nBut new research shows how Taproot, Bitcoin\u2019s 2021 scripting upgrade, can dramatically increase the theoretical capabilities of the chain, potentially making it far more useful, even with no additional changes.\n\nA paper published by Robin Linus, whose non-profit ZeroSync recently completed a key component of a future zero-knowledge light client for Bitcoin, describes a so-called \u201cBitVM\u201d \u2014 which can be read as \u201cBitcoin Virtual Machine.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nIt\u2019s essential to note that, unlike the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), BitVM doesn\u2019t execute computations on-chain but rather verifies them, similar to optimistic rollups.\n\nAs might be expected, Bitcoiners have been all a-twitter on the platform formerly known as\u2026let\u2019s just call it X.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the most exciting discovery in the history of bitcoin script,\u201d said Super Testnet, a pseudonymous software developer who reviewed the paper.\n\nEric Wall said he\u2019s \u201ccautiously excited, waiting for what the real-world experiments will yield.\u201d\n\nThe key innovation is that Bitcoin \u201cis able to be the trusted third party for an arbitrary [Turing] complete computation despite the fact bitcoin script is not able to actually execute it,\u201d according to the helpful explainer from software engineer Gregor Poga\u010dnik.\n\nDespite the theoretical implications, Poga\u010dnik doesn\u2019t believe Ethereum-like smart contracts are feasible.\n\n\u201cI believe this is quite cumbersome and likely not even the primary design goal,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s novel is that it could, and all without requiring any changes to Bitcoin\u2019s core software \u2014 no forks required.\n\nAn early practical application of the technology could be to decentralize the oracles for Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), according to Bob Bodily, CEO Bioniq, an ordinals marketplace.\n\nDLCs are a type of smart contract for Bitcoin that allows two parties to create bets or derivatives without requiring a trusted third party.\n\nBitVM could enhance the functionality, security, and versatility of DLC oracles by providing mechanisms for on-chain verification of oracle data, making them fully trustless.\n\nNot a panacea\n\nThere are limitations. BitVM is limited to two specific participants \u2014 a prover and a verifier \u2014 although there may be workarounds.\n\nBy contrast, Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts can involve multiple parties and can be executed by any user, making Ethereum more versatile for multi-party applications.\n\nOff-chain computation could lead to increased latency and complexity too.\n\nImagine you wanted to have the Bitcoin network enforce the rules of a chess game, for instance. If a given move requires an on-chain transaction (e.g., to resolve a dispute over its legality), then the players become subject to Bitcoin network\u2019s 10-minute average block confirmation time.\n\nYou can forget about blitz or rapid games, but such a system might be suitable for correspondence chess, where moves can be exchanged over days and chess engine use is de rigueur.\n\nSo, while BitVM introduces an innovative approach to bring Turing-complete contracts to Bitcoin, practical limitations may prove to undermine its utility.\n\nEven Blockstream CEO Adam Back was unimpressed, analogizing BitVM to 7-year-old research from Greg Maxwell during his tenure as Blockstream\u2019s technology chief.\n\nLinus responded that Back may have missed a few key differences that set BitVM apart.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThere also remains some debate over whether BitVM solves the problem of trustless bitcoin (BTC) bridging for sidechains. Bioniq\u2019s Bodily and others have doubts, but further research will make that clear.\n\nEthereum remains a more comprehensive platform for general-purpose smart contract development and execution. However, BitVM\u2019s approach could be valuable for specific use cases or for those who prioritize Bitcoin\u2019s security and decentralization properties.\n\nA Telegram group set up today anyone interested in BitVM has already attracted several hundred members. One commenter fairly succinctly summed up the importance of the concept:\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t require any change to bitcoin, but lots of work to make useful things with it.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The connection between gold and bitcoin (BTC) as stores of value is obvious, and the demand for BTC as a digital store of value was a big reason why the cryptocurrency grew in popularity, crypto services provider Matrixport said in a report Monday.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market capitalization is $540 billion, equivalent to 10.8% of the market cap of physical financial gold, Matrixport said, adding that gold exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) are valued at $200 billion.\n\nThis is why potential approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of a U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF could result in inflows of $20 - $30 billion, potentially triggering a large rally in the cryptocurrency, the report said.\n\nThe SEC has dragged its heels on approving a spot bitcoin ETF, and in August said it was delaying its decision on all new applications until October. The crypto market is hopeful that such an approval will trigger a flood of mainstream money into the sector.\n\nStill, bitcoin has an edge over gold as the private keys can be memorized, which eliminates the risk of confiscation, the report said.\n\n\u201cEven today, storing assets in the form of gold has not only become unfashionable in the digital age, but comes with significant restrictions when crossing borders,\u201d wrote Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, adding that \u201cbitcoin offers a solution to this dilemma, enabling the swift and relatively inconspicuous movement of value across borders.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, considering the current state of technological developments, bitcoin\u2019s primary roles are likely as a store of value akin to gold and a speculative financial asset,\u201d the report added.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Price May Boom in October, Could Hit $37K by Year-End: Matrixport"

        "title": "The Bitcoin 16 Year Cycle, And Its Correlation To The Internet Bubble - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Everyone has heard about the 4-year cycle that Bitcoin is going through, but have you ever thought of the idea that Bitcoin might be going through a bigger cycle? And could this bigger cycle reflect the way humans adopt new technologies? And is it possible we have seen something similar before with another technology like the internet? In this article, we will be diving into a new theory that suggests that Bitcoin is moving through a larger 16-year cycle which can help us predict the direction of the Bitcoin price in the coming years.\n\nThe Regular 4 Year Cycle\n\nBitcoin tends to go through 4-year cycles which are divided into 2 parts, the uptrend and the downtrend. A regular 4-year cycle consists of a 3-year uptrend followed by a 1-year downtrend also known as a bear market. So far Bitcoin has completed 4-year cycles and they\u2019ve shown incredible accuracy which catches the attention of the market participants.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nThe DOTCOM Cycle\n\nOne can\u2019t ignore the similarities between the market structure of the S&P500 during the DOTCOM cycle and the Bitcoin cycle. The regular financial markets also went through clear 4-year cycles with the majority of the cycle being in an uptrend and the downtrend, also known as a bear market, shortly lived. From my perspective, the DOTCOM cycle started around 1986 as this was the moment that Microsoft went public, one of the biggest companies of the DOTCOM cycle. The first 3 4-year cycles of Bitcoin look very similar to the first 3 4-year cycles of the S&P500 starting from 1986.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nThis really spiked my interests as both periods are based on the adoption of a completely new technology that shifts the way our society perceives and uses information. The personal computer and the internet changed our lives completely to the point that it\u2019s almost unthinkable to be unconnected to the internet for more than 24 hours. In the future it will as well be unthinkable to not own and use any Bitcoin, we\u2019re just still in the early phase of its adoption.\n\nSo could the structure of the DOTCOM cycle help us to determine a potential path for Bitcoin? First of all, I would like to emphasize the fact that market cycles in my honest opinion are one of the best ways to use rough price predictions and ascertaining when to enter and when to exit a particular market. But I really want to emphasize the word \u201crough\u201d. There goes a saying, \u201chistory\n\ndoesn\u2019t repeat itself but it sure does rhyme\u201d, and I think this applies to cycles too. Nothing is ever a 100% replication of anything that happened before, but it can give us a rough estimate of what might happen.\n\nAs you can see in the structure of the DOTCOM cycle, the first 3 4-year cycles are very similar, a long bull market followed by a short but sometimes shallow bear market or correction. It's only that the last 4-year cycle is different, the tables are flipped upside down. It starts with an acceleration in the price which doesn\u2019t last that long and is followed by a multi-year long bear market. Could Bitcoin do something similar, disappointing the ones who expect a regular 4-year cycle and surprise the majority with a multi-year-long bear market?\n\nMicrosoft is following a similar path. It starts with 3 4-year cycles that are right-translated, followed by a 4-year cycle that is left-translated, so a prolonged bear market in an asset that has been in a strong bull market for years.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nMicrosoft topped in the year 2000, marking a long-term top in the price at approximately $60. And it wasn't until 2015 that that level was broken again. It took 15 years from that high to completely recover and surpass that level again. If we were to take the money supply into consideration it actually takes longer for Microsoft to recover and break the high 21 years later in May 2021.\n\nChart from TradingView.\n\nBoth of these charts, Microsoft and the S&P500, really demonstrate the magnitude of a correction after a prolonged bull-market. It\u2019s challenging to imagine from one's perspective a prolonged bear market of an asset you\u2019ve experienced mostly going up. Is it possible that we\u2019re going to see, in rough terms, something similar with Bitcoin?\n\nConfluence Between Cycles\n\nSo let\u2019s have a look at what these cycles are forecasting for Bitcoin and how we potentially could prepare for these outcomes. First of all, it's interesting to note that one date is forecasting the same outcome in the regular 4-year cycle, the 16-year cycle.\n\nA regular 4-year cycle would suggest that we\u2019re staying in an uptrend until 2025, followed by a 1- year decline. This is a typical 4-year cycle which we\u2019ve seen 3 times in the history of Bitcoin.\n\nThe 16-year cycle would suggest that we would follow a similar path as the DOTCOM bubble as mentioned above. Bitcoin would peak within the first half of the cycle, so by the latest at the end of 2024, this would be followed by a multi-year-long decline going into 2026 to form new lows.\n\nHow To Spot A Top\n\nOne of the best indicators a Bitcoin trader can use are the Bitcoin funding rates. The funding rates are showing basically whether the majority of the market participants on derivative markets are shorting or longing for Bitcoin. I\u2019ve found this indicator very useful to spot a top in the Bitcoin price as in a healthy bull market when the funding rates are negative, the price tends to trend up. In a bear market, when the funding is positive, the price tends to decline. So we can use this metric to spot which market conditions the market is trading in and if anything has changed. One of the first signals when Bitcoin entered a bear market in 2022 was that the price of Bitcoin was declining with negative funding rates, and that does generally not happen in a healthy bull market.\n\nAnother way to look for the cycle top is timing, whenever Bitcoin is in the period of topping for let\u2019s say the 16-year cycle and we break below a swing-low, chances increase that a cycle top is in. This would then be invalidated by breaking back above that specific level, to re-claim this level. To view the period of a potential cycle top, one can have a look at the Bitcoin cycles progression bars. Once the yellow dot enters the red zone, it means that based on that specific cycle we are in the topping period. Again, it is important to mention that cycles can help to give a rough estimate of potential outcomes, they often don\u2019t unfold very accurately and there is room\n\nFurther Considerations\n\nThere are more factors at play here that influence the price of Bitcoin other than these cycles. The fact that the Federal Reserve started to print huge amounts of money in 2020, really spiked the risk appetite for many investors to look for a safe haven like the financial markets and Bitcoin. It\u2019s very clear that the moment the Federal Reserve started to inject money into the economy, the price of Bitcoin and the financial markets started to go up until the money printer halted again in 2022 and the price of Bitcoin entered a 1-year declining phase. These fundamental changes in the economy will most likely have an impact on Bitcoin and the way these cycles could unfold.\n\nChart from Blockchain.com\n\nThis is a guest post by Jeroen van Lang.

        "title": "If You're Expecting Bitcoin to Soar Before or After the Halving, You Need to Read This - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The next Bitcoin (BTC -2.38%) halving, set to take place in April 2024, is already shaping up to be one of the most anticipated crypto events of the year. Since previous Bitcoin halvings have led to huge rallies, Bitcoin bulls are already predicting another massive rally in 2024, with some suggesting that Bitcoin could skyrocket past the $100,000 mark.\n\nBut just how likely is this scenario? Based on Bitcoin's price performance after similar halving events in 2012, 2016, and 2020, there's certainly reason to be optimistic. But there are three key factors to consider before you go all in on Bitcoin.\n\nThe past performance fallacy\n\nPerhaps the biggest narrative surrounding the Bitcoin halving is that halving always pushes Bitcoin to another all-time high. Most recently, after the last halving event in May 2020, Bitcoin eventually reached its all-time high of $68,790 in November 2021. And the story was largely the same back in 2012 and 2016, when halving events catalyzed impressive bull market rallies.\n\nThus, any Bitcoin pricing model that relies on past data is probably going to tell you that Bitcoin is going to rally again in 2024. For example, crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital has analyzed the three previous Bitcoin halvings, crunched all the data, and concluded that Bitcoin is likely to surge to $36,000 by April 2024 before exploding in value to $149,000.\n\nBut remember: Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. And keep in mind that during the 2020 Bitcoin halving event, a lot of stimulus money was sloshing around a zero-interest-rate economy, and worldwide lockdowns were the norm.\n\nSupply and demand\n\nThe argument for a halving-induced rally focuses on the supply of Bitcoin. With any Bitcoin halving, the reward for mining a new Bitcoin block is also halved. As a result, the rate of supply of new Bitcoin is halved, introducing an element of scarcity. The scarcity effect means the price of Bitcoin should go up, provided demand stays the same or rises.\n\nBut what about the demand side of the equation? After all, Economics 101 tells us that the price of an asset is based on the intersection of supply and demand. The typical argument is that a halving event makes Bitcoin more deflationary, which boosts its attractiveness to investors seeking a hedge against inflation, which boosts demand. Fair enough.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the overall macroeconomic environment also affects demand. When interest rates are near zero, there's intense demand for risk assets. However, when rates rise, that makes risk assets relatively less appealing. Thus, the demand for a risk asset like Bitcoin typically falls during a rising-interest-rate environment, which is where we are now. In early October, a top Bloomberg strategist suggested that Bitcoin might actually crash to $10,000 if interest rates continue to rise.\n\nA \"lite\" halving?\n\nFinally, it's important to keep in mind evidence from cryptocurrencies similar to Bitcoin. Take Litecoin (LTC -2.25%), a proof-of-work crypto, just like Bitcoin. In fact, Litecoin was created using the Bitcoin source code, so it's possible to argue that Litecoin is a good proxy for modeling the impact of Bitcoin halvings.\n\nAnd the evidence from Litecoin is mixed, at best. Prior to this year, Litecoin had two halvings, in 2015 and 2019. And, as can be seen from Litecoin's trading chart, it's impossible to pinpoint an obvious sustained rally in either instance. And then, in August of this year, Litecoin had another halving. This was supposed to send Litecoin soaring, only it didn't. Litecoin is actually down 9% for the year.\n\nWhat to do about Bitcoin price predictions?\n\nPerhaps the best advice for crypto investors is to take any Bitcoin halving price prediction with a grain of salt. The closer we get to the actual halving event, the more inflated these price predictions could become. The conventional wisdom is that Bitcoin will eventually test its all-time high of $68,790 after the next halving. More aggressive estimates call for Bitcoin to hit the $100,000 mark and beyond.\n\nBut what if we only get a Bitcoin halving \"lite\" next year? If you take a much more conservative view, Bitcoin might increase in value by only 25%, which is approximately how much it increased in the first 150 days after the 2020 halving. If you're counting on a huge surge in value for Bitcoin in 2024, you may be disappointed."

To me, that\u2019s the one that I think has the most likely possibility of becoming a universal viable currency.

        "title": "Bitcoin Inscriptions Surpass NFT Minting On Ethereum, Solana, Polygon Despite Bear Market - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin inscriptions, a new way to store data on the Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) blockchain, have surpassed 35 million since their inception in January.\n\nOrdinals are digital artifacts that can be inscribed onto Bitcoin using the Ordinals protocol.\n\nThey can be anything from text files, images, and audio to videos, and can be used to store a wide variety of data on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAccording to a report by Galaxy Digital, text files represent the vast majority of Bitcoin inscriptions, accounting for approximately 95% of all inscriptions.\n\nAlso Read: People Are Going To Start Cashing Out Bitcoin \u2014 Here's Why\n\nImage-based inscriptions account for approximately 3.5% of all inscriptions, with the remaining 1.5% consisting of other types of digital artifacts.\n\nOrdinals Activity Since March: In the first 200 days since the first inscription on Bitcoin, a total of 1.14 million image-based inscriptions have been created.\n\nThis surpasses the number of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) minted on other blockchains, such as Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), and Polygon (CRYPTO: MATIC), since the debut of NFTs on these respective networks.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Bitcoin's minting activity throughout the first 200 days is still much lower than the total minting activity for NFTs on other blockchains, illustrating how Ordinals still have a long way to go in terms of adoption relative to the broader NFT ecosystem.\n\nOrdinals Trading Volume: Despite the unfavorable market conditions for NFTs in 2023, Ordinals accomplished meaningful growth.\n\nBitcoin has accumulated the third-highest NFT trading volume by the network at $596.4 million.\n\nEven when excluding BRC-20s, which represent ~30% of all Ordinals volume ($187.5 million), Bitcoin remains the third most popular chain for digital collectible activity after Ethereum and Solana.\n\nOrdinals Marketplaces: The most dominant marketplaces by volume for Ordinals are now Magic Eden, Unisat, and OKX at 28%, 28%, and 38% respectively.\n\nImplications for the Future of Bitcoin: The growing popularity of Bitcoin inscriptions is a significant development for the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIt suggests that Bitcoin is being used for more than just a store of value and a medium of exchange. It is also being used to store and share data, which could lead to new and innovative use cases for Bitcoin in the future.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin inscriptions could be used to create a decentralized social media platform or a decentralized storage platform. They could also be used to create new forms of digital art and collectibles.\n\nRead Next: Bitcoin To $20K, Ethereum To $1K?

        "title": "Bitcoin price could hit $750K to $1M by 2026 \u2014 Arthur Hayes - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Love him or hate him, when Arthur Hayes speaks, people listen.\n\nLast week, as a guest on Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Hayes made the case for why he believes Bitcoin (BTC) price will hit $750,000 to $1 million by 2026.\n\nHayes said:\n\n\u201cI absolutely agree that there is going to be a major financial crisis, probably as bad or worse than the great depression, sometime near the end of the decade; before we get there, we\u2019re gonna have, I think, the largest bull market in stocks, real estate, crypto, art, you name it, that we\u2019ve ever seen since WW2.\u201d\n\nHayes cites the nearly predictable response of the United States government rushing in to intervene in every economic crisis with a bail-out as a key catalyst behind the structural problems in the U.S. economy.\n\nHe explained that this essentially creates an endless cycle of central bank printing, which leads to inflation and prevents the economy from going through natural market cycles of growth and correction.\n\n\u201cWe all have collectively agreed that the government is there essentially to attempt to remove the business cycle. Like, there should never be bad things that happen to the economy, and if there are, we want the government to come in and destroy the free market. So, every time we\u2019ve had a financial crisis over the past 80 years. What happens? The government rushes in, and they essentially destroy some part of the free market because they want to save the system.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at a few of the catalysts that Hayes believes will back Bitcoin\u2019s move into six-figure territory.\n\nMounting debt and out of control inflation.\n\nAccording to Hayes, mounting government debt, a large amount that needs to be rolled over and diminishing productivity can only be addressed with money printing. While monetary expansion does lead to bull markets, the consequence tends to be high inflation.\n\n\u201cIn the first instance, it creates a massive bull market in stocks, crypto, real estate, things that have a fixed supply, maybe they\u2019re productive and have some earnings. But after that, we\u2019re going to find out that, actually, the government can\u2019t save everything. It can\u2019t just print as much money as they think to try to save themselves by fixing the yield and price of their bonds, and we\u2019re going to get a generational collapse.\u201d\n\nHayes expects a \u201cmassive top\u201d at some point in 2026, followed by a great depression-like situation by the end of the decade.\n\nThe U.S. government bankrupted the banking system\n\nWhen asked about future contributors to inflation, Hayes zoned in on the $7.75 trillion in U.S. debt that must be rolled over by 2026 and the yield curve inversion in U.S. bonds.\n\nTraditionally, China, Japan and other nations were the main buyers of U.S. debt, but this is not the case anymore \u2014 a change that Hayes believes will exacerbate the situation in the states.\n\nWhy do I love these markets right now when yields are screaming higher?\n\n\n\nBank models have no concept of a bear steepener occurring. Take a look at the top right quadrant of historical interest rate regimes.\n\n\n\nIt's basically empty. pic.twitter.com/P6MQnCU73N \u2014 Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) October 4, 2023\n\nAccording to Hayes, \u201cthe U.S. banking system is functionally insolvent because the regulators made the rules in such a way that it was profitable from an accounting perspective, not an economic perspective, to essentially take in deposits and buy low-yielding Treasurys, and they could do it with almost infinite leverage and a few basis points differing in the change of the price, and everyone makes a lot of money and gets a big bonus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe banks collectively bought all these treasuries in 2021, and obviously, the price went down a lot since then, and that\u2019s why we have the regional banking crisis.\u201d\n\nThe largest concern expressed by Hayes is that \u201cat a structural level, the U.S. banking system cannot buy more debt because it cannot afford to because it is structurally insolvent. The Federal Reserve has committed to doing quantitative tightening, so it\u2019s not accumulating more Treasurys.\u201d\n\nHayes explained that the market is digesting this, and the nuance here is that despite high rates on U.S. Treasurys, gold prices remain high and certain market participants who previously were treasury buyers are disinterested.\n\nCurrently, banks struggle to attract deposits, and the difficulty of matching their deposit rates to the current rates available in the market creates revenue and debt management stress at a level that could become critical to the function of the entire banking system. Like many cryptocurrency advocates, Hayes believes that it\u2019s in times like this that a certain cohort of investors begins to look at different investment options, including Bitcoin.\n\nHayes\u2019 view on why Bitcoin is destined for $750,000\n\nDespite what appears to be a generally dismal outlook on the global and U.S. economy, Hayes still expects Bitcoin price to outperform, placing a target estimate in the $750,000 to $1 million range by the end of 2026.\n\nHayes expects Bitcoin to continue:\n\n\u201cChopping around $25,000 to $30,000 this year as we get to some sort of financial disturbance and people recognize that real rates are negative. If the economy is growing at a nominal rate of 10%, but I\u2019m only getting 5% or 6%, even though it\u2019s high, people on the margin are going to start buying other stuff, crypto being one of those things.\u201d\n\nComing into 2024, Hayes said either a financial crisis will push rates closer to 0%, or the government will keep raising rates, but not as fast as governments spend money and people continue looking for better returns elsewhere.\n\nThe eventual approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S., Europe and perhaps Hong Kong, plus the halving event, could push the price to a new all-time high at $70,000 in June or July of 2024. Regaining the all-time high by the end of 2024 is when the \u201creal fun starts and the real bull market starts,\u201d and Bitcoin enters the \u201c750,0000 to $1 million on the upside.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether the estimated price level would stick, Hayes agreed that a 70% to 90% drawdown would occur in BTC price, just like it has after each bull market.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The Canadian Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Hut 8 continues to accumulate self-mined BTC amid the ongoing merger deal with the industrial cryptocurrency miner, US Bitcoin (USBTC).\n\nHut 8 mined 111 Bitcoin in September 2023, bringing its self-mined BTC reserves to 9,366 Bitcoin, the firm announced on Oct. 10.\n\nThe amount of Bitcoin mined by Hut 8 in September is up around 8% from the previous month but is still significantly lower than in May 2023 when Hut mined 147 BTC. The Bitcoin miner has seen its mining pace drop significantly over the past year, as its monthly mining volumes dropped nearly 60% from 277 BTC mined in September 2022.\n\nBut despite seeing a notable decline in the amount of monthly-mined Bitcoin, Hut 8 has remained committed to its hodl strategy, which has not been seen among too many miners in the industry.\n\n\u201cNo Bitcoin was sold during the month,\u201d Hut 8 said, stressing that the company owns one of the largest self-mined BTC reserves among publicly traded firms. \u201cTotal balance of Bitcoin in reserve was 9,366 on September 30 \u2014 7,269 of which were unencumbered,\u201d the firm added.\n\nHut 8\u2019s latest BTC reserve expansion comes in line with the company\u2019s long-term hodl strategy. Unlike many crypto miners forced to sell at least part of their mined Bitcoin holdings amid tough market conditions, including firms like Core Scientific and Riot Blockchain, Hut 8 has continued to steadily increase its Bitcoin stash. As of September 2022, Hut 8 had about 8,000 BTC in its reserves.\n\nIn the announcement, Hut 8 also mentioned the success of its ongoing merger deal with USBTC. Announced in February 2023, the transaction is expected to create a new Bitcoin mining business called Hut 8 Corp, or \u201cNew Hut.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitfarms increases mining pace, generates 411 BTC in September\n\nIn September 2023, Hut 8 and USBTC obtained final approval from the Supreme Court of British Columbia for the merger deal.\n\n\u201cProgress toward completing our transaction with USBTC continues, and we\u2019re grateful to our shareholders who demonstrated their overwhelming support by voting in favor of the merger,\u201d Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton said.

        "title": "Why Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash Slumped Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nA divergence appears to be building, at least in Monday's price action, between certain top cryptocurrencies and the broader equity market. While most risk assets declined in morning trading Monday in response to surging oil prices and an escalating conflict in the Middle East, equities recovered during the afternoon, with crypto assets underperforming.\n\nAs of 3 p.m. ET, Ethereum (ETH -3.30%), Dogecoin (DOGE 4.38%), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH 0.13%) had declined 3.3%, 3.6%, and 5.1%, respectively, over the prior 24 hours.\n\nSo what\n\nEthereum's decline appeared to have been driven by more than just macroeconomic factors. News that the Ethereum Foundation (which supports development and innovation on the Ethereum blockchain) had swapped $2.7 million worth of Ethereum for stablecoin USDC (USDC 0.01%) on Monday sent the token lower. While swaps like this have been seen in the past, and are used by the Ethereum Foundation as a way to cover costs, sell-offs typically follow such transactions. This was the case once again on Monday.\n\nInterestingly, both Bitcoin Cash and Dogecoin appear to be increasingly seeing intraday moves that are more correlated with the overall market. Monday's outsized moves in both these tokens indicate investors may be viewing them as ways to play momentum in either direction in the crypto sector. In other words, Dogecoin's status as a meme token and Bitcoin Cash's status as a higher-volatility token could be viewed by traders as making them opportune ways to gain leverage to broader crypto market moves in the near term.\n\nNow what\n\nIt's rarely good news to see one of the most sophisticated developers in the crypto sector selling assets to cover its operating costs. And while that's not necessarily a novel concept for investors who follow Ethereum, the market's reaction to this sale speaks volumes about what I think could be a shifting narrative around the sustainability of this space.\n\nFor those looking at the crypto sector as a way to diversify their portfolios, investing in tokens tied to projects that continue to invest in themselves continues to be a good idea. In that regard, this move by the Ethereum Foundation may be viewed in a positive light by those who believe that most of the innovation in this sector continues to come from this blockchain.\n\nFor traders and speculators looking to play the broader moves in this sector (driven by Ethereum and Bitcoin, primarily), altcoins and higher-leverage tokens will always be around to trade. That said, if I had to pick one of these tokens to buy on Monday's decline, it would have to be Ethereum. That's partly because of the aforementioned continued reinvestment into the network's technology, as well as the fact that Ethereum has typically headed higher again in the wake of previous Ethereum Foundation sales."

        "content": "The United States economy seems like it is refusing to be derailed. It added a staggering 336,000 jobs in September, defying most expectations. This achievement becomes all the more remarkable against the backdrop of soaring yields on longer-term Treasury bonds and surging mortgage rates.\n\nThe message embedded in the job data is crystal clear: the world\u2019s largest economy continues to charge forward, even in the face of aggressive monetary tightening. It\u2019s a testament to the economy\u2019s resilience, and suggests that higher interests are here to stay for an extended period.\n\nWhile this news could send shivers down some spines, particularly for those invested in stocks, it\u2019s crucial to understand the bigger picture. Stocks may appear less enticing when you can secure a 6% return with a savings account, yet we may be reaching an inflection point with bonds.\n\nIt has to get worse before it gets better\n\nThe bond market has witnessed a historic rout, described by Bank of America Global Research as the \u201cgreatest bond bear market of all time.\u201d But the analysis isn\u2019t all doom and gloom \u2014 there are hints that the relentless sell off in U.S. Treasuries could come to an end. And if we do indeed see a recovery, it could signal the start of a new bull market for risk assets.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: A $600B tipping point for crypto\n\nTurning to crypto, it\u2019s crucial to recognize that short-term Bitcoin (BTC) price action remains somewhat linked to regulatory decisions, particularly those pertaining to a Bitcoin spot ETF. So far, all of the positive news surrounding spot ETFs has failed to move Bitcoin out of its holding pattern. A green light on this front could unleash substantial inflows into BTC, providing the much-awaited impetus for a resurgence. It would also be remiss not to mention the ongoing FTX saga, which is currently playing out in the courts and damaging crypto\u2019s reputation.\n\nUnited States Federal Funds Effective Rate, 1955-2023. Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist \u2014 what may spell bad news for financial markets could be good for the broader economy. The Federal Reserve holds a pivotal role in shaping the path for risk assets, and it has just two more meetings before the end of the year. Should the Fed decide to suspend further rate hikes, it could act as a catalyst, triggering market anticipation of an impending rate cut. This anticipation could, in turn, set the stage for a massive risk-on rally across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nFestive revelry could set the tone for 2024\n\nThe last three months of the year often introduce a heightened Santa rally. After the year we\u2019ve had, it might soften the blow and pave the way for a more palatable 2024. History shows that the market tends to gather momentum during this festive season, with a surge in buying activity and positive sentiment among investors. Among these factors, regulatory decisions regarding spot ETFs and any potential pause in rate hikes, or even a shift in the Fed\u2019s messaging concerning future hikes will be watched closely. So while the cheer from September\u2019s jobs data tends to drive immediate headline moves in the market, it doesn\u2019t necessarily steer the long-term thinking of the Fed.\n\nRelated: Sky-high interest rates are exactly what the crypto market needs\n\nLooking ahead into 2024, we are faced with the prospect of a BTC \u201chalvening\u201d in April, historically a positive event for crypto. However, the broader macroeconomic conditions have signalled some signs of instability. Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing correlation with stock markets adds an extra layer of complexity to the equation. The outcome hinges on the messaging from the Fed \u2014 and decisions made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding spot ETFs. If the macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain, the Fed may pivot toward rate cuts, potentially altering the trajectory of both traditional and digital asset markets.\n\nWith hints of a bond market recovery and the prospect of regulatory clarity in the crypto space, we could see brighter days ahead. As we approach the festive season, the potential for a Santa rally rekindles the type of hope and momentum that ignites the crypto market. While some challenges may loom, history teaches us that sometimes, it gets worse before it gets better.\n\nLucas Kiely is chief investment officer of Yield App, where he oversees investment portfolio allocations and leads the expansion of a diversified investment product range.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Mining Stocks Like Marathon, Cleanspark, and Riot Crashed Last Month - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nShares of many Bitcoin (BTC -2.54%) mining stocks crashed hard in September 2023, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Riot Platforms (RIOT -6.91%) lost 17.8%, Cleanspark (CLSK -9.41%) stock fell 22.7%, and Marathon Digital's (MARA -8.71%) shares dropped 33.4%.\n\nThese sudden price drops are not unheard of in this volatile market sector, but they are usually caused by a large price drop in Bitcoin. The largest cryptocurrency did trade lower last month, but only by 1.4%. So why did the crypto miners take such dramatic haircuts in a fairly quiet month for Bitcoin itself?\n\nSo what\n\nFirst and foremost, the crypto miners were soaring sky-high at the start of September. By the time the calendar page flipped, both Marathon and Riot had more than tripled their share prices year-to-date. The environment-focused Cleanspark trailed the larger miners, but was still up by 142% on Aug. 31.\n\nIt didn't take much of a Bitcoin correction to drive these stocks far lower. Gently pumping the brakes on Bitcoin's value growth was enough to trigger these significant drops.\n\nNow what\n\nThe crypto market had turned sour in 2022, started a sharp rebound in early 2023, and lost steam again in recent weeks. These swings are a close match for the bullish and bearish signs in the global economy, which can't seem to get out of its inflation doldrums after two years of price-control government policies.\n\nSo investors are unconvinced that high-risk investments will pay off in the long run, especially if the company behind each stock must take new loans at lofty interest rates to finance its operations.\n\nThis risk-averse attitude is bad news for Bitcoin and even worse for the crypto-mining experts. That's why Cleanspark, Riot, and Marathon tend to exaggerate Bitcoin's market moves, both on a day-to-day basis and in the long run.\n\nNow, the miners were not completely quiet last month.\n\nRiot produced 333 new Bitcoin tokens in August but also sold 300 to fund its operations. The company also explained how it lowered Bitcoin production during the heat wave in August, supplying 84,000 megawatts of sorely needed energy to the struggling Texas infrastructure in exchange for a $7 million payment.\n\nCleanspark generated 659 tokens and sold 43 for a net increase of 616 Bitcoins. Construction is now underway on a new Bitcoin mining facility in Georgia.\n\nMarathon mined 1,062 digital coins without selling any, and also issued 31.7 million new shares to cancel $417 million of its convertible notes debt.\n\nBitcoin mining companies may look similar to the uninitiated, but each one runs its mining process on distinctly different principles. Riot produces its own power and sells some in a separate revenue stream. Cleanspark bends over backward to ensure environmentally friendly mining operations, which may come in handy if the federal or state government imposes green energy requirements at some point. And Marathon's epic scale is hard to match, but it's also the only company in this trio that carries a significant debt balance.\n\nSo, if you want to invest in one of these amplified Bitcoin vehicles during a modest downturn, you could either do a deep dive and figure out which one's the best fit for your strategy, or grab a few shares of each to form a more diverse miner portfolio.\n\nBut remember, the potential for soaring gains comes with exposure to massive risks, too. September's sudden price drops served as a reminder of that fact -- in a steady Bitcoin environment, no less. Bitcoin mining stocks won't suit every investors' level of risk tolerance."

        "title": "Oman bets big on cryptocurrency mining despite Bitcoin's volatility - The Circuit",
        "content": "The oil-rich country is staking a share of its future on digital money. A cooler southern climate, business-friendly regulation and cheap energy could help it succeed\n\nFor the last two years, the market value of Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride, the volatility leading institutional investors and regulators to question the cryptocurrency\u2019s long-term viability.\n\nBut look to the Gulf countries and a different story is taking shape: the United Arab Emirates and Oman are looking seriously at regulating digital assets while crypto firms are flocking to Dubai to set up shop. Oman, for its part, is betting big on cryptocurrency mining. Observers say a cooler climate in Salalah, in the south, compared to elsewhere in the desert nation, as well as business-friendly regulation and cheap energy could help it succeed.\n\nIn August, the oil-rich country announced close to $800 million in investments in crypto-mining operations, including $300 million with Abu Dhabi-based Phoenix Group to develop a 150-megawatt crypto-mining farm with Green Data City, Oman\u2019s first licensed crypto-mining entity, slated to go online next year. Weeks earlier, Muscat approved a $370 million farm operated by Exahertz International.\n\nOman is looking to diversify beyond fossil fuel revenues under its \u201cVision 2040\u201d economic agenda, which focuses on the buildout of modern energy and telecommunication infrastructure that aims to attract foreign investment and create knowledge-worker jobs.\n\n\u201cCrypto might be uniquely suited to Oman\u2019s policy style to diversify its trading partners and sources of non-hydrocarbon income,\u201d Sam Blatteis, CEO and co-founder of the MENA Catalysts, a government relations firm for tech companies, told The Circuit.\n\nOver the last decade, crypto mining has gone from a basement-type operation distributed over individual computers to large centralized mining pools that require large capital investment and sophisticated machines to solve ever-harder-to-attain matches to cryptographic solutions.\n\nThis is energy-intensive work.\n\nOman offers some of the cheapest electricity in the world, costing only around 5 cents per kilowatt hour, compared to 23 cents in the U.S. This significantly lowers the operational costs for crypto mining. A medium-sized crypto-mining operation in Oman could save millions of dollars in electricity costs compared to operating in the U.S., which is home to over a third of all crypto mining globally.\n\nThe move will not be without controversy as crypto mining is often derided for not being environmentally friendly. Bitcoin mining generates 21 to 53 million tons of carbon per year, according to an analysis by Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nSheikh Mansour Bin Taleb Bin Ali Al Hinai, chairman of Oman\u2019s Authority for Public Services Regulations, commented in a press statement about his government\u2019s support of Bitcoin mining facilities: \u201cThis initiative aligns with our goal to diversify our economy, integrating modern technologies while upholding our commitment to ethical and sustainable practices.\u201d\n\nThe country is aiming for at least a third of energy production to be from renewable sources by 2030.\n\nBut energy isn\u2019t the only focus. Stability matters, too, according to those who have chosen to do business in Oman.\n\n\u201cIn previous years, the mining industry was only focused on finding the lowest prices of electricity, and this led to disasters in unstable countries like China, Kazakhstan, Russia and Paraguay,\u201d Olivier Ohnheiser, CEO of Green Data City in Muscat, told The Circuit.\n\n\u201cEven the U.S. is threatening the mining industry with taxes and higher electricity prices in the next few years. So, now, with the consolidation of the industry under publicly listed mega-miners, the priority is stability. Most miners prefer to have 50% of their operations as a maximum in the U.S., and 50% diversified elsewhere. Oman is one of the best places, if not the best place, for that.\n\n\u201cOman offers long-term stability and fixed prices of electricity in the long run,\u201d Ohnheiser continued. \u201cThe country is stable and is known to respect its commitments.\u201d\n\nJad Kharma, CEO of Exahertz, the other crypto mining operator with an Omani license, agrees.\n\n\u201cThis is Switzerland of the Middle East,\u201d he said of government stability. \u201cI felt safer as a foreign investor to put my hands in the hands of the people that are shaping the future for the country\u201d than in other countries in the region.\n\nPlus, Kharma likes the quality of life in Salalah, the microclimate in southern Oman where the crypto mining takes place. It\u2019s often many degrees cooler than elsewhere in the Arabian Gulf: an actual oasis.\n\nThe oasis has Jaran Mellerud\u2019s attention. An associate at Luxor, a Seattle -based company that develops crypto-mining technologies, he traveled to the UAE and Oman over the summer to check out the mining operations underway and evaluate if either country has the potential to take up significant market share in the near future.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is a very simple way of monetizing excess electricity,\u201d he told The Circuit. \u201cIf there is a place that has a lot of excess electricity, but has no other way of quickly putting it to use, Bitcoin mining is a very efficient way of attracting investment into that area, for example in southern Oman, with all this excess electricity.\u201d\n\nOman has the advantage in the region for other reasons other than an excess of cheap energy. Solid government support and a relatively cooler climate are other main drivers.\n\n\u201cThe only way to mine Bitcoin in a scalable and legally sustainable way in Oman is by closely cooperating with the government. Miners need licenses and are also expected to provide significant benefits to the community. In return, they get tax benefits and access to loads of competitively priced electricity.\u201d\n\nMellerud predicts that Oman will become an increasingly important destination for Bitcoin over the next couple of years and could, together with the UAE, take the Middle East\u2019s total share of the Bitcoin mining network to above 15%."

        "content": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) appears to have largely decoupled from traditional equities, as evidenced by its price trajectory no longer mirroring that of major indices such as the S&P 500.\n\nThis divergence is particularly noteworthy given the S&P 500's recent bounce off the 4200 points level, while Bitcoin had already reached the bottom of its current range, according to a Bitfinex report.\n\nThis phenomenon underscores the evolving dynamics between traditional financial markets and the cryptocurrency sector. Such developments and their implications for investors and traders will be a focal point of discussion at the upcoming Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 14.\n\nThe correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 reached its zenith on Aug. 25, with a value of 0.8. Since then, the correlation has been on a decline, with Bitcoin exhibiting slower upward movement compared to equities and more pronounced downturns throughout September.\n\nCurrently, the correlation value stands at -0.5, indicating that the two are moving in opposite directions.\n\nSuch decorrelation is typically observed when there's a sudden bullish or bearish development in either asset class, or when one market prices in information more rapidly than the other.\n\nThe S&P 500, for instance, closed above the pivotal 4300 level on Oct. 6, marking its second-largest daily increase since June 15 this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the dominance of stablecoins in the crypto market has seen a slight dip, now accounting for 11-11.4% of the total crypto market cap.\n\nBitcoin's volatility has also made a significant entrance this October.\n\n\"As of now, the Implied volatility to Historical volatility ratio is 1.16, which, though a decrease from last week, still signifies that the market expects greater volatility. It's noteworthy that while the disparity between these metrics has narrowed, both measures have simultaneously risen on an absolute basis, indicating that expectations of future volatility are aligned with recent historical data but at a higher level than before,\" the Bitfinex analysts told Benzinga.\n\nAlso Read: Komainu Gets Approval For UK Crypto Register: Crypto Custody Goes Mainstream\n\nHistorical data shows a 24-hour volatility surge of over 340% on Oct. 2, with predictions suggesting that this trend will continue for the remainder of the month.\n\nSince October's onset, Bitcoin's volatility has surpassed its average for the past 200 days.\n\nHistorically, volatility in the U.S. stock market precedes similar trends in other risk assets, including Bitcoin.\n\nThe VIX, which measures the S&P 500's volatility, hit its lowest point in three and a half years on Sept. 15, 2023, but has since rebounded past the crucial 18 level.\n\nIn terms of Bitcoin holdings, short-term holders (STH) \u2014 those who've held BTC for less than 155 days \u2014 have offloaded approximately 1 million BTC since April 13, 2023.\n\nA significant portion of this, 200,000 BTC, was sold between Sep. 25 and 26.\n\nOn the broader economic front, the U.S. presents a mixed bag.\n\nWhile the housing market is under pressure with declining mortgage applications and pending home sales, the manufacturing sector is showing signs of recovery.\n\nThe Purchasing Managers manufacturing sub-index recently reported its first expansion in almost a year.\n\nHowever, the U.S. job market's foundation appears shaky, despite an uptick in job openings and employment growth.\n\nRead Next: Hacker Steals Then Returns Funds For Reward To Huobi's HTX: 'You Made The Right Choice'\n\nMeet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga's exclusive event: Future of Digital Assets.

        "title": "Bitcoiner drops BitVM paper \u2014 Bringing Ethereum-like contracts to Bitcoin - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A Bitcoin developer has proposed a new way to bring more expressive off-chain smart contracts to Bitcoin without needing a soft fork.\n\nAnnounced in an Oct. 9 white paper titled \u201cBitVM: Compute Anything on Bitcoin\u201d by ZeroSync project lead Robin Linus, BitVM enables Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts without altering Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules.\n\n\"Any computable function can be verified on Bitcoin\"https://t.co/Itf9UHos0C pic.twitter.com/CLQv49Ydsg \u2014 \u044fobin linus (@robin_linus) October 9, 2023\n\nA Turing-complete system is one that can theoretically provide an answer to any computational problem.\n\nWith BitVM, the \u201clogic\u201d of Bitcoin contracts would be executed off-chain, but verification would be made on Bitcoin \u2014 similar to Ethereum\u2019s optimistic rollups.\n\nBitVM\u2019s architecture is based on fraud proofs and a challenge-response model where a \u201cprover\u201d can make claims and a \u201cverifier\u201d can perform a fraud proof to punish the prover when false claims are made.\n\nLinus explained that Bitcoin, in its current form, is limited to basic operations, such as signatures, timelocks and hashlocks \u2014 but that can now be broadened with BitVM, which Linus says can compute a host of interesting applications.\n\n\u201cPotential applications include games like Chess, Go, or Poker, and particularly, verification of validity proofs in Bitcoin contracts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, it might be possible to bridge BTC to foreign chains, build a prediction market, or emulate novel opcodes,\u201d said Linus.\n\nLinus said a limitation of the model is that it is limited to a two-party setting with a prover and a verifier and that a significant amount of off-chain computation and communication is needed to execute programs.\n\nLinus said the next \u201cmilestone\u201d is to fully implement the BitVM in addition to Tree++, a high-level programming language to write and debug Bitcoin contracts.\n\nBitVM is enabled by the Taproot soft fork, which took place in November 2021.\n\nLinus cited Ethereum research into optimistic rollups and a study on Merkle trees in contributing to the eight-page white paper.\n\nBitcoiners respond to BitVM\n\nProminent Bitcoiner Eric Wall posted on X (Twitter) that the concepts outlined in the BitVM white paper \u201ccheck out\u201d and that he is \u201ccautiously excited\u201d to see what real-world experiments stem from it.\n\nBitcoin analyst Dylan LeClair is also impressed with BitVM\u2019s white paper. But Adam Back, a Bitcoin Core contributor, suggested that people shouldn\u2019t get too excited about the development just yet.\n\nfor people getting (over) excited, this is cool but effectively a generalization of a two-party game - it says right in the abstract - so it's a bit like Greg Maxwell's 2016 ZKP contingent payments implemented example https://t.co/OeHRsbFjud \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) October 9, 2023\n\nRelated: BIP-300 biff: Debate reignites over years-old Bitcoin Drivechain proposal\n\nOne builder in the blockchain space, \u201cdotta,\u201d noted that there is already a proof-of-concept on GitHub.\n\nAnother X user, Sam Parker, attempted to resolve a common fear among Bitcoin (BTC) maximalists by explaining that BitVM won\u2019t force Bitcoin\u2019s to be \u201clocked\u201d into these contracts.\n\n\u201cFinally, this is opt-in. If you don\u2019t trust your coins being locked to some Turing complete contract (totally reasonable) then don\u2019t lock them to a Turing complete smart contract. One of [the] beauties of the UTXO system is security sandboxing.\u201d\n\nOthers, such as \u201cPsage,\u201d say BitVM adds to the list of things that will push Bitcoin\u2019s price forward in the next bull market.\n\nThe bullish stuff around #Bitcoin is snowballing, lots of them controversial, nevertheless a few off my finger tips:\n\n- BitVM\n\n- Ordinals\n\n- Multiple Pres Candidates talking about it\n\n- ETF\n\n- Halving\n\n- Privacy improvements\n\n- Exponential Hash Rate increase\n\n- Countries mining\n\n.... \u2014 psage (@perspiringsage) October 9, 2023\n\nCointelegraph contacted Linus for comment but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nMagazine: Wolf Of All Streets worries about a world where Bitcoin hits $1M: Hall of Flame"

        "title": "'Did bitcoin leak from an American spy lab'? - The Times of India",
        "content": "What was the origin of Covid-19? The prevailing belief among most experts is that the virus made the leap from wild animals to humans, possibly at a meat market in Wuhan . However, an alternate theory suggests the virus might have accidentally escaped from a virology research lab in the same city. Even a US probe committee, formed by President Joe Biden , did not arrive at a definitive conclusion about the origins of the Covid-19?According to a report in the Economist, a similar debate is now emerging around Bitcoin, the first and most widely used cryptocurrency.Bitcoin's accepted genesis story involves an individual named Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous coder who described the cryptocurrency in a 2008 paper before disappearing from public view. However, an online theory suggests that Bitcoin might have been developed by the National Security Agency (NSA), an American intelligence agency known for its cryptography research. Some proponents of this theory point to a 1996 paper by NSA employees titled \"How to make a mint: the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash,\" which references work by a researcher named \"Tatsuaki Okamoto\", the Economist report said.Critics argue that this paper is not substantial evidence. It primarily surveys cryptographic concepts for digital cash, relying on a central authority, unlike Bitcoin, which is decentralized. The idea that the NSA would create a decentralized cryptocurrency that could disrupt its own government's functions seems implausible, according to skeptics like David Rosenthal.The only similarity between bitcoin and the NSA paper is that they both use some common cryptographic techniques, such as public-key encryption and digital signatures. But these techniques are widely known and used in many other applications, not just digital cash. They are not exclusive to the NSA or bitcoin.There is no reason to believe that bitcoin leaked from an American spy lab. It is more likely that Satoshi Nakamoto was an independent inventor who was influenced by various sources of cryptographic research, including the NSA paper, but also others.While this theory likely falls into the realm of conspiracy, a historical precedent exists. In 1997, it was revealed that Clifford Cocks, a mathematician at GCHQ, the British equivalent of the NSA, had secretly invented a crucial cryptographic technology foundational to both Bitcoin and the internet. This technology was developed years before a trio of American researchers received credit for it.A more fitting comparison between Bitcoin and Covid-19 might be their resilience, the Economist report says."

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nVolcano Energy and Luxor Technology Corporation unveiled El Salvador\u2019s first Bitcoin mining pool powered by renewable geothermal energy. The first Salvadorian Bitcoin mining pool is named \u2018Lava Pool\u2019.The infrastructure will mine profitably in and out of El Salvador. The project\u2019s first phase involves the construction of a 241-megawatt (MW) renewable energy park in Metap\u00e1n, consisting of 169 MW of solar photovoltaic energy and 72 MW of wind energy. The project\u2019s long-term goal is to harness the abundant geothermal energy in the country.The pool is an outcome of a strategic collaboration between Volcano Energy, a renewable energy-focused Bitcoin mining company and Luxor Technologies, a Bitcoin mining tech company.Luxor, which operates one of the top ten Bitcoin mining pools, will offer Lava Pool participants Bitcoin hedging strategies to reduce losses due to market volatility. Luxor will receive a nominal fee from Lava Pool for its services.Luxor\u2019s Chief Operating Officer(COO), Ethan Vera, expressed his support for the mission, \u201cThe ethos of Bitcoin mining revolves around geographical decentralisation, and the development of mining pool infrastructure in El Salvador will contribute to this goal\u201d, he said. Volcano Energy\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer(CSO), Gerson Martinez, also shared his vision: \u201cOur vision is to create a vertically integrated energy and Bitcoin mining company whose value is accretive to investors and to all Salvadoran citizens. We are thrilled to launch Lava Pool in partnership with Luxor Technology, an industry leader in developing Bitcoin mining products and services for miners\u2014from plebs to nation states.\u201dAccording to a declaration by Volcano Energy, they plan to give 23% of their net income from mining operations to the El Salvador government. Some of the profits will be used to revitalise the country\u2019s current power transmission and distribution infrastructure.In 2021, El Salvador captivated the attention of the global crypto community by becoming the first country to recognise Bitcoin as a legal tender. As underlined by Martinez, \u201cLava Pool is another example of El Salvador\u2019s first mover advantage as a nation-state in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\u201dWith the launch of its first Bitcoin mining pool, El Salvador now leads the way in harnessing the potential of Bitcoin mining and renewable energy. This presents an opportunity for other countries with ample renewable energy sources to use Bitcoin mining to improve the economics of their new energy projects."

Discover SCENE\n\nCoinShares latest investment report revealed a surge of investment into the market, with a total of $78 million pouring into the sector.\n\nThis is the second consecutive week of positive inflows, with almost a four-fold increase from $21 million in the previous week, and also the largest week of inflows since July this year, as noted by the report\u2019s author James Butterfill.\n\n\u201cBitcoin was the main beneficiary, seeing inflows totaling $43m last week, although some investors saw recent price strength as an opportunity to add to short-Bitcoin positions, which saw inflows of $1.2m over the same period,\u201d wrote the CoinShares analyst.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrading volumes for crypto-related exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw a robust increase of 37%, reaching $1.13 billion over the span.\n\nThe report also highlights a notable uptick in Bitcoin (BTC) trading volumes, up by 16% on listed cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nRegionally, a stark divergence in sentiment is evident, as 90% of the total inflows originated from Europe, while the United States and Canada collectively received just $9 million in inflows, per the report. This same divergence was seen last month too, with CoinShares citing the adverse regulatory climate in the U.S.\n\nEthereum ETFs garner modest interest\n\nLast week\u2019s debut of Ethereum futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. marked a significant moment for Ethereum (ETH) investors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, investor response to these products was somewhat mute, with just under $10 million in inflows during the first week.\n\nAs the report noted, this \u201ctepid appetite\u201d is in sharp contrast with the launch of Bitcoin futures-based ETFs in October 2021, which attracted a whopping $1 billion in the same timeframe.\n\n\"It is likely due to poor investor appetite for digital assets at present, and unfair to compare to the Bitcoin futures ETF launches in October 2021, as appetite was much higher for the assets class overall,\u201d argues Butterfill.\n\nIn contrast to the modest start for Ethereum ETFs, Solana (SOL) experienced a substantial surge in inflows, recording its most significant weekly inflow of $23.9 million since March 2022.\n\nThe industry\u2019s eighth largest cryptocurrency continues to assert itself as the \u201cpreferred altcoin,\u201d per the report, a claim that was also supported last week when Solana\u2019s total value locked in DeFi space soared to the year\u2019s all-time high of over $338 million."

        "title": "Bitcoin Halving To Happen In 2024 - What Is It & How Can It Shoot Bitcoin Price To All-Time High? - Indiatimes.com",
        "content": "At a time when Bitcoin price has shown a significant recovery this year till date after the bloodbath of 2022, crypto billionaire Changpeng Zhao, who is the CEO world's largest crypto exchange Binance, has made a bold prediction.\n\nWhat Has Binance CEO Predicted?\n\nreuters\n\nThe Binance CEO has expressed his belief that the next Bitcoin halving process, scheduled for 2024, could usher in a period of renewed price growth, and even push Bitcoin price to an all-time high.\n\n\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Halving?\n\nBitcoin halving is when the reward for Bitcoin mining is cut in half. The halving policy was written into Bitcoin\u2019s mining algorithm to counteract inflation by maintaining scarcity. In theory, the reduction in the pace of Bitcoin issuance means that the price will increase if demand remains the same. Halving takes place every four years.\n\nAlso Read: Goldman Sachs Lends Its First Bitcoin-Backed Loan\n\nHow Is Bitcoin Halving Done?\n\ngetty\n\nFirstly, a decentralized network of validators verifies all Bitcoin transactions in a process called mining. They are paid 6.25 BTC when they are the first to use complex math to add a group of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain as part of its proof-of-work mechanism. Those blocks of transactions are added roughly every 10 minutes, and the Bitcoin code dictates that the reward for miners is reduced by half after every 210,000 blocks are created. That happens roughly every four years in periods that are often accompanied by heightened Bitcoin price volatility.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: US Man Pays 10,000 Bitcoins For Pizza\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Halving Impact The Price?\n\ngetty\n\nBitcoin Halvings, which occur approximately every four years, are pivotal events in the cryptocurrency's history. During these events, the rate at which new Bitcoin is created through mining is reduced, resulting in a reduction in the asset's issuance.\n\n\n\nAs alluded to by Zhao, this supply shock has historically had a significant impact on the price of Bitcoin, resulting in all-time highs in 2013, 2017, and 2021. For the unversed, the first Bitcoin halving occurred in November 2012. The next halving was in July 2016, and the most recent halving was in May 2020.\n\nSo, in all of the last four bitcoin halvings, the crypto token's price did reach an all-time high in the following year. As per this trend, bitcoin prices will hit a new all-time high by 2025.\n\nCurrently, bitcoin price is $27,528.80.\n\nBillionaire Zhao's remarks on the potential for \"all-time highs\" following the 2024 Bitcoin halving are grounded in historical trends. Over the past three halvings, Bitcoin has experienced remarkable price surges in the years that followed, as per NASDAQ.\n\nBinance CEO Zhao offers the following explanation for the data:\n\nPre-Halving Excitement: In the lead-up to a Bitcoin halving, the cryptocurrency community typically witnesses a surge in excitement, discussions, and media coverage. This phenomenon reflects the anticipation and high expectations surrounding the event.\n\n\n\nPost-Halving Reality: Contrary to some expectations, the price of Bitcoin does not immediately double overnight following a halving. Instead, the immediate aftermath is often characterized by a period of consolidation and adjustments.\n\n\n\nSubsequent Price Surges: It is in the year or years following a Bitcoin halving that the cryptocurrency's price has historically surged to new all-time highs. This phenomenon is driven by a combination of factors, including increased awareness, growing adoption, and the reduced rate of Bitcoin production.\n\nAs such, the remarks find Zhao echoing the belief of many Bitcoiners that the asset is becoming predictable and cyclical with its price movements, as a result of the fact that it is sound money whose monetary policy isn't controlled by governments. These events serve as a reminder of the digital currency's deflationary characteristics, setting it apart from traditional fiat currencies.\n\nNow it remains to be seen whether 2024's bitcoin halving indeed ends up shooting up bitcoin's price or not. We'll have to wait and watch!\n\nAlso Read: World's First Ever Bitcoin Tower Set To Be Built In Dubai\n\nFor the latest and more interesting financial news, keep reading Indiatimes Worth.

        "content": "There is a lot of buzz in the gaming and crypto communities about the possibility of Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) integrating cryptocurrencies into its gameplay. GTA 6 x Bitcoin Spark?\n\nThis feature would allow players to earn, spend, or trade digital currencies within the virtual world of GTA 6, adding a new layer of realism and immersion. But, Rockstar Games has not confirmed or denied these rumours, leaving fans to speculate and imagine how crypto gaming would work.\n\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\n\nCrypto gaming is not a new concept\n\nCrypto gaming has been around for a while, with games like Axie Infinity and Decentraland leading the way. These games use Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as digital assets that players can collect, trade, or sell for real-world value. NFTs are unique and scarce tokens that represent ownership of digital items, such as art, music, or game characters.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Spark?\n\nOne of the cryptocurrencies that could benefit from crypto gaming is Bitcoin Spark (BTCS). Bitcoin Spark is a fork of Bitcoin that uses a novel 'Proof of Process' consensus mechanism. This mechanism aims to create a more fair and decentralized network, where rewards are distributed based on the quality and quantity of work done by the nodes. Bitcoin Spark also claims to have faster transactions, lower fees, and higher scalability than Bitcoin.\n\nALSO READ| Fans are mocking GTA 6 \u2018announcement\u2019 leaker, sending death threats\n\nBitcoin Spark\u2019s vision of fairness and decentralization aligns well with the gaming industry\u2019s goals of creating inclusive and engaging in-game economies. If Bitcoin Spark is integrated into GTA 6 or other crypto games, it could offer players a new way to participate in the game world and benefit from their gaming activities.\n\nIs Crypto gaming risky?\n\nCrypto gaming is not without risks. The crypto market is volatile and unpredictable, with regulatory uncertainties and potential security breaches. Moreover, crypto gaming could face game-specific challenges, such as balancing the gameplay, preventing cheating, and protecting user privacy.\n\nThe rumours about GTA 6 and cryptocurrencies have sparked a lot of interest and curiosity among gamers and crypto enthusiasts. As for Bitcoin Spark, its unique features could make it a suitable candidate for crypto gaming integration. The future of crypto gaming is full of possibilities."
