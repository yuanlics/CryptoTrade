The SEC's approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs now gives the cryptocurrency legitimacy, accessibility, mainstream reach and acceptance. But Bitcoin was supposed to be so much more \u2013 a revolution, bypassing the traditional financial system with a democratic, decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system for unbanked populations. But Wall Street did what Wall Street does best. This week on TechCheck, how Bitcoin lost by winning."

        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nGold investing could be a smart alternative to buying Bitcoin in today's crypto market, and there are a few good reasons why. Getty Images\n\nBitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, has been an alluring investment option in recent years thanks to its growing value and position as a trusted crypto asset. However, Bitcoin's pricing \u2014 and the wider crypto market \u2014 has experienced extreme volatility over the last year, with periods of pricing declines and upticks that have been hard to predict.\n\nAnd, the crypto asset experienced yet another significant correction this week when the price of Bitcoin dropped to $40,000 \u2014 a decline of approximately 12% and the lowest price point since December 18, 2023. This price drop occurred shortly after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to commence trading on January 10.\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was a move that had initially been expected to bolster the cryptocurrency's value \u2014 but instead triggered a correction that sent shockwaves through the market. And, that plunge in Bitcoin's price has left investors grappling with uncertainties. In turn, some investors may be reevaluating their strategies, considering alternative assets \u2014 like gold \u2014 that may provide a more stable haven instead. But is gold actually a good alternative to Bitcoin? Let's find out.\n\nReady to get started? Find your top gold investing options here.\n\nBitcoin is falling. Should you invest in gold now?\n\nWith the price of Bitcoin falling, it could make sense to consider investing in gold instead \u2014 and there are a few good reasons why, including:\n\nThe historic stability of gold\n\nGold has long been considered a safe-haven asset, meaning that it can help to protect your wealth during periods of market or economic turbulence. And, unlike Bitcoin, which is a relatively new entrant in the financial landscape, gold has historically weathered a number of economic storms.\n\nThat's a large part of why investors have traditionally turned to gold during times of crisis. They view it as a store of value that retains its worth even in the face of market fluctuations. And, with the price of Bitcoin fluctuating right now, it may be a good time to consider adding gold to your portfolio to help offset some of the potential losses from your crypto investments.\n\nLearn more about how you can invest in gold today.\n\nThe inverse relationship with equities\n\nGold has long exhibited an inverse relationship with traditional equities, often acting as a counterbalance to stock market movements. When stocks experience volatility or decline, gold has historically seen increased demand by investors.\n\nThis inverse correlation can be an attractive feature for investors seeking diversification in their portfolios, especially during times when the broader market is facing challenges. And, if your portfolio includes a large amount of Bitcoin, this could be the right time to take advantage of gold's ability to move inversely to Bitcoin and many other investment assets.\n\nGold's ability to hedge inflation\n\nWhile the inflation rate has been tempered compared to what it was this time last year, the most recent inflation report showed that we may not be done just yet. Inflation ticked back up unexpectedly in December and is still hovering above the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2% and it's unclear what may happen in the future.\n\nBut while the timeline for resolving the inflation issues may be up in the air, what's clear is that gold has historically proven to be an effective hedge against rising prices due to inflation. The precious metal has historically maintained its purchasing power amid high inflation, making it an attractive option for investors who are concerned about the eroding effects of inflation on their portfolios.\n\nThe tangible asset appeal\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which exists purely in digital form, gold is a tangible asset with intrinsic value. Physical gold, whether in the form of gold bullion \u2014 like gold bars and coins \u2014 or jewelry, provides investors with a tangible asset they can hold. This tangible appeal can offer a sense of security and ownership that digital assets, like crypto, may lack.\n\nThe global economic uncertainty\n\nThe ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties that are occurring across the globe can also contribute to increased demand for gold. In times of crisis or uncertainty, investors often flock to assets perceived as safer, and gold tends to be a primary beneficiary of such sentiment. So, given the current geopolitical climate, it could be a smart time to invest in gold \u2014 especially as Bitcoin's value drops.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAs Bitcoin faces a period of correction following the SEC's approval of ETFs, investors may find themselves at a crossroads, evaluating the resilience of their portfolios. While cryptocurrencies offer unique opportunities to investors, the recent market downturn also prompts a reconsideration of traditional safe-haven assets. And gold, with its historical stability, inverse relationship with equities, inflation-hedging qualities, tangible appeal and ability to thrive in times of global economic uncertainty, emerges as a compelling option.\n\nThat said, investors who are interested in gold investing should carefully assess their risk tolerance, investment goals and overall portfolio diversification strategy before making any decisions. While Bitcoin and gold represent distinct asset classes with different risk profiles, the current market conditions emphasize the importance of a well-balanced and diversified investment approach. And, in times of uncertainty, having a mix of assets that respond differently to market dynamics can help safeguard investors against the inherent volatility of financial markets."

Some are plain vanilla, diversified index funds that let you invest in the entire stock and bond markets, and are excellent core holdings for the great majority of people.\n\nThen there are the quirky, narrowly focused E.T.F.s like the Inverse Cramer Tracker, which enables you to bet against the stock picks of the CNBC television host Jim Cramer. The fund is legal, approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and a money-loser since its inception last year. Betting against Jim Cramer just isn\u2019t a great investing strategy.\n\nNeither is fear of missing out. Yet FOMO is the main reason for putting money into Bitcoin, which remains highly speculative, difficult to categorize and without an immediately identifiable economic function.\n\nThe S.E.C. this month approved 11 new E.T.F.s that track the price of Bitcoin, and the decision has been heralded by promoters of Bitcoin \u2014 and of the new funds \u2014 as an important event, legitimizing Bitcoin as an asset class."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved applications from large investment firms to offer spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Retail investors can now buy bitcoin ETFs on traditional exchanges instead of crypto-specific exchanges or trading in even more volatile crypto futures. The SEC\u2019s approval comes as a reversal, due in large part to a recent court ruling, from its prior denial of these applications.\n\nMany of the big institutional investment firms that frequently see their products offered in 401(k) plans, like Fidelity and Blackrock, have created bitcoin ETFs, which will make it easier for investment fiduciaries to add these ETFs as an option in workplace retirement plans.\n\nBut should they?\n\nIn guidance from March of 2022, the U.S Department of Labor (DOL) said it has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about crypto in employer-sponsored retirement plans, and investment fiduciaries should exercise \u201cextreme care.\u201d\n\nChoosing investment options to offer in a 401(k) plan is a fiduciary function \u2014 even if participants make their own choices from those options. In choosing the investment options, fiduciaries must adhere to duties of prudence and loyalty \u2014 the \u201chighest known to the law\u201d \u2014 and risk personal liability.\n\nWhen fiduciaries add crypto as an investment option, the DOL says, it tells participants that knowledgeable investment experts see it as a prudent option for retirement investing. But the DOL has several reasons why it may not be prudent, and the concerns persist even if bitcoin is offered solely through a brokerage window.\n\nFirst, crypto investments are extremely volatile and speculative and can cause devasting losses to participants \u2014 especially those nearing retirement.\n\nSecond, it is very difficult for participants to make informed investment decisions given the craze over above-market returns. Plan participants, who are generally not investment experts, may expect high returns without fully appreciating the risk of loss to retirement assets. It is extremely difficult, even for professionals, to \u201cseparate the facts from the hype.\u201d\n\nFinally, the DOL expressed concerns with the reliability and accuracy of valuations, the way crypto is custodied (or not), and the evolving regulatory environment.\n\nPlan sponsors should fully understand the fiduciary risk before allowing any plan assets (including through a brokerage window) to be invested in crypto \u2014 including the new ETFs \u2014 and expect to be questioned by the DOL about the prudence of the decision.\n\nThis article appeared in the January 18, 2024, issue of The Journal Record.

        "content": "The spot Bitcoin ETF run by the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, showed its early dominance in becoming the first among a newly approved group of crypto-linked financial products to reach $1 billion in assets under management.\n\nThe firm\u2019s ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), beat out the other 10 exchange-traded products approved by the SEC last week, including those from fellow TradFi stalwarts Fidelity and Franklin Templeton.\n\nReaching $1 billion in assets under management in such a short time would be noteworthy for any ETF, much less one that has faced an uphill battle for approval from the SEC, said Steven Lubka, managing director and head of private clients at Swan Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the history of all ETFs, period, BlackRock is in rarefied air,\u201d Lubka told Fortune.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, said in a statement that the major inflows to IBIT in just one week reflect strong investor demand.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning. We have a long-term commitment focused on providing investors access to an iShares quality ETF,\u201d Mitchnick said in a statement to Fortune.\n\nLubka added that the strength of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF shows that Bitcoin will benefit overall as reliable TradFi firms replace failures such as FTX and Celsius as investors\u2019 entry point to the crypto market. Although in statements the SEC tried to distance itself, the agency\u2019s approval of the ETFs after just over a decade of rejections also helped, Lubka said.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin surged in the aftermath of the approvals last week, its price has since fallen to about $42,400\u2014down from $46,700 a week ago. Lubka said the stall in Bitcoin\u2019s price is likely due to some outflows from Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, which has the highest fee of all the new products at 1.5%. It could also be attributed to some investors managing risk by waiting to see what happens now that the market has been changed by the new TradFi entrants, he added.\n\n\u201cI think, short term, traders realized there\u2019s no catalyst in the next one to two weeks that\u2019s going to drive the price 20% higher\u2014this is going to be a little more on the medium term,\u201d Lubka said."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency and fund management industries witnessed a watershed moment on Jan. 10, marking a significant milestone with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of 11 new spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.\n\nThis development signifies a major shift from the previous norm where exchange-traded funds were limited to holding Bitcoin futures. These newly approved Bitcoin ETFs are physically backed by Bitcoin held with a custodian, which offers substantial benefits including lower tracking error and a more direct exposure to the cryptocurrency's price movements.\n\nThis breakthrough follows a tumultuous yet pivotal year in 2023, characterized by a renewed Bitcoin bull run and a landmark legal victory by Grayscale Investments. Following these developments, various ETF providers were quick to amend their prospectuses, positioning themselves at the forefront of this new investment opportunity.\n\nThe days leading up to the SEC's approval were filled with tension, notably marked by the compromise of the SEC's Twitter (now X) account. A false approval was prematurely tweeted on Jan. 9, adding to the suspense and anticipation within the investment community prior to the debut of these ETFs.\n\nThe aftermath of the official approval on Jan. 11 was nothing short of dramatic, with U.S. Bitcoin ETFs experiencing a trading volume surge to $4.6 billion. Bitcoin itself reached a peak of $48,922 during the trading frenzy, reflecting the market's enthusiastic response to this historic decision. Within days, it would be trading below $42,000 once more.\n\nHere's a comprehensive list of all the new Bitcoin ETFs approved by the SEC that are available for trading:\n\nETF Current Expense Ratio Fee waiver? Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker: GBTC) 1.5% No Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF (DEFI) 0.9% No Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) 0% Yes. Through Aug. 2 for first $10 billion in AUM, then 0.19% VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) 0.25% No iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) 0.12% Yes. 12-month waiver for first $5 billion in AUM, then 0.25% Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) 0% Yes. Goes to 0.25% after three months Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) 0% Yes. Six-month waiver for first $5 billion in AUM, then 0.39% WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) 0% Yes. Six-month waiver for first $1 billion in AUM, then 0.3% Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) 0% Yes. Goes to 0.25% on Aug. 1 Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) 0% Yes. After six months or $1 billion in AUM, goes to 0.21% Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) 0% Yes. Six-month waiver on first $1 billion in AUM, then 0.2%\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC)\n\nFormerly a closed-ended trust, the reigning king GBTC has now been converted into an open-ended ETF. Its history dates back to 2013 as the world's first publicly traded Bitcoin fund. Currently, it remains the largest Bitcoin ETF with more than $25 billion in assets under management, or AUM, as of Jan. 17.\n\nHowever, the ETF's dominance may be waning slightly. In the opening days of the various Bitcoin ETF launches, GBTC saw some net outflows as investors flocked to the newer, less expensive ETFs. This was largely due to GBTC's continued high expense ratio, which currently sits at 1.5%.\n\nHashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF (DEFI)\n\nDEFI started out a Bitcoin futures ETF, but changes are underway. On Jan. 11, the firm announced a change to the ETF's investment strategy that would allow it to hold spot Bitcoin. The firm anticipates that the ETF's name and strategy will be later changed formally to reflect this modification.\n\nThe main selling point for DEFI is the prospect of investing alongside a firm with dedicated cryptocurrency industry experience. Hashdex is responsible for creations like the Nasdaq Crypto Index, which provides a benchmark for industry enthusiasts. DEFI charges a 0.9% expense ratio.\n\nFranklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC)\n\nKnown for its extensive lineup of international equity funds, Franklin Templeton has also thrown its hat into the Bitcoin ETF space with EZBC. This ETF tracks spot Bitcoin held with a trusted custodian, which in this case is Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN).\n\nEZBC is traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and has so far has attracted around $49 million in AUM, representing 1,160 Bitcoin as of Jan. 17. The ETF is currently waiving fees to zero through Aug. 2 for the first $10 billion of AUM.\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL)\n\nHODL's ticker name is a humorous reference to the cryptocurrency pop culture motto of \"hold on for dear life.\" Many cryptocurrency investors use \"HODL\" to describe an unwillingness to sell their Bitcoin even during periods of high volatility or a prolonged \"crypto winter,\" when prices are in the doldrums.\n\nThe ETF itself has accumulated about $86 million in AUM through Jan. 17, with an expense ratio of 0.25%. Like DEFI, it is also traded on the CBOE. For those seeking even higher exposure, VanEck anticipates HODL will have an options chain, but this is currently unavailable.\n\niShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)\n\nBlackRock Inc. (BLK), one of the world's largest asset managers, also took part in the Bitcoin ETF race with IBIT, which debuted on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF initially charged a 0.25% expense ratio, but BlackRock has since waived that by half to 0.12% for the first $5 billion of AUM over a 12-month period.\n\nSo far, IBIT has been quite successful, reportedly cracking the $1 billion AUM figure on Jan. 18, less than a week after its debut. BlackRock has also done a fairly good job of keeping this ETF liquid, with a median bid-ask spread of 0.04% as of Jan. 18.\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)\n\nAs with HODL, BRRR's ticker may also be a humorous reference to the sound of money being printed. The ETF trades on the Nasdaq exchange alongside IBIT, and is currently waiving its regular 0.25% expense ratio to zero for the first three months in an effort to attract investors.\n\nAs with EZBC, BRRR's underlying Bitcoin will be held with Coinbase as its custodian. So far, the ETF has attracted more than $62 million in net assets, corresponding to around 1,485 Bitcoin at the time of this writing. The benchmark index for this ETF is the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate - New York Variant.\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO)\n\nInvesco Ltd. (IVZ) has also expanded into the Bitcoin ETF space. The firm's offering here is BTCO, which currently has about $137 million in AUM as of Jan. 17. As with some of the previous ETFs, Invesco is waiving fees from 0.39% to zero for a six-month period on the first $5 billion in AUM.\n\n\"In addition to offering a simpler, more familiar access point to Bitcoin, BTCO brings together the unparalleled expertise of a veteran ETF provider like Invesco and an established crypto native like Galaxy,\" says Kathy Kriskey, senior ETF strategist at Invesco.\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW)\n\nDespite being known more for its lineup of fundamentally weighted dividend funds, WisdomTree hasn't shied away from entering the Bitcoin ETF competition. Going up against industry heavyweights like BlackRock and Grayscale, the firm launched BTCW as its spot Bitcoin ETF offering.\n\nTo attract inflows, BTCW has also implemented a fee waiver. For a six-month period commencing Jan. 11, the ETF is waiving its 0.3% expense ratio to zero for the first $1 billion in AUM. However, the ETF is still off to a fairly slow start with just $3.1 million in AUM accumulated through Jan. 17.\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC)\n\nFBTC isn't actually Fidelity's first spot Bitcoin ETF. On Nov. 30, 2021, the firm launched the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) in Canada. This was possible as the Canadian securities regulator permitted the debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs far earlier than the SEC did.\n\nWith the SEC decision in the books, Fidelity is now free to levy its substantial presence and marketing resources to ensure the U.S. version of FBTC becomes a success. This includes wading into the ongoing fee war with a waiver as well, reducing FBTC's expense ratio from 0.25% to zero. On Aug. 1, the 0.25% fee is slated to return.\n\nArk 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)\n\nArk Invest and its star manager, Cathie Wood, have been no strangers to headlines in recent years. Wood regularly has her fund's trades covered in media, such as a recent purchase of Tesla Inc. (TSLA) by the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) and the Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).\n\nThanks to a partnership with 21Shares, Ark Invest now offers Bitcoin exposure as well through ARKB. Listed on the CBOE, ARKB has managed to attract just $10.3 million in inflows through Jan. 10, making it a bit of a laggard in the race. Like the other ETFs, it is also temporarily waiving its expense ratio. Once it attracts $1 billion in AUM, or when six months have passed, whichever comes sooner, it will charge a 0.21% expense ratio.\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB)\n\nBitwise is one of the few firms to list its Bitcoin ETF on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE. This dedicated cryptocurrency asset manager debuted BITB and has achieved strong success in the opening days of the Bitcoin ETF race with $354 million in AUM through Jan. 17."

Earlier, it fell as far down as $40,601.37, its lowest level since Dec. 18. Ether , which has gotten a boost in recent days while bitcoin struggled, fell too. It was last down 3% at $2,448.41. The rest of the crypto market broadly dragged with them.\n\nThe move in bitcoin weighed on crypto-related stocks, too. Coinbase and MicroStrategy ended the trading day down 7% and 2%, respectively. Miners CleanSpark and Marathon Digital lost more than 6% each, while Riot Platforms fell 5% and Iris Energy retreated 8%.\n\n\"We are still in the correction post-ETF launch,\" said Julio Moreno, head of research at crypto data provider CryptoQuant.\n\n\"Short-term traders and large bitcoin holders are still doing significant selling in a context of a risk-off attitude,\" he added. \"Additionally, unrealized profit margins have not fallen enough for sellers to be exhausted.\""

Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI have some observational comedy to share with you this week.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s great. What did you observe?\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, we have a sort of infamous crime problem in the Bay Area.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, people say that we are caught in a doom loop where, I think, every crime inspires another crime.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. And so now \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nWe\u2019re circling back.\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) Exactly. So I did see an innovation in crime prevention in my \u2014 near my house this week, which was, I went to get money out of the ATM, because my barber \u2014 I was going to get my haircut \u2014 only accepts cash.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s interesting. We might want to alert the authorities about that. Something\u2019s going on there.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo I went to an ATM and found out when I got there and put in my card and put in my PIN number that it was a cashless ATM. Have you heard of this?\n\ncasey newton\n\n(LAUGHING) Wait, what is a cashless ATM?\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) So I only learned this after I put in my card, but it was like, OK, well, we don\u2019t have cash in this ATM, so you can check your balance. You can make a transfer between accounts, or \u2014 or that\u2019s it, basically.\n\ncasey newton\n\n(LAUGHING) Wait, that\u2019s the most useless machine I\u2019ve ever heard of.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI know. I was like, at that point, why do you \u2014 like, what percentage of people who go to an ATM are doing things other than getting cash out?\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right. Because everything that you just described \u2014 you can just, like \u2014 I guarantee you that your bank has an app that does that. There does not need to be a machine in the physical world that does \u2014 the one thing that you need from the physical world is physical paper.\n\nkevin roose\n\nExactly. So this is an innovation, I would guess, like a crime prevention thing. Can\u2019t rob an ATM if there\u2019s no cash in it.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt prevents crime, and it also just prevents customers from using it to do the only thing that they want to do.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I did \u2014 I was telling a friend about this, and they said, you know, it\u2019s sort of like a restaurant that has no food.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYou can come in. You can sit down. You can play with the forks.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThere\u2019s a scale. You can weigh yourself.\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) Go nuts. But if you want food, you\u2019re out of luck.\n\ncasey newton\n\nGo somewhere else. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nI\u2019m Kevin Roose, a tech columnist for \u201cThe New York Times.\u201d\n\ncasey newton\n\nI\u2019m Casey Newton from \u201cPlatformer.\u201d\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd this is \u201cHard Fork.\u201d\n\ncasey newton\n\nThis week, how OpenAI is working to prevent ChatGPT from disrupting global elections. Then, the times David Yaffe-Bellany joins to explain why Bitcoin is back, and finally, \u201cNew York Magazine\u201d John Herrman stops by to tell us how e-commerce took over TikTok and whether it can be stopped. I sure hope so. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nCasey, this week, OpenAI released a new blog post about how they are thinking about the 2024 elections. We have elections coming up, obviously, in this country, but also in many countries around the world. And OpenAI has been sort of \u2014 people have been asking questions about, will you allow your tools to be used in this or that way when it comes to elections. And this week, they sort of came out with this post saying, this is our stance on how AI can and should and shouldn\u2019t impact elections.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, and this has sort of become an interesting feature of modern life, where in the run-up to big global elections, tech platforms will come out and they\u2019ll say, hey, here\u2019s sort of the harms and abuses that we know can take place on our platforms, and here\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it in advance. Maybe here\u2019s some reminders about what\u2019s banned, and maybe here\u2019s some new things that we\u2019re going to do this year to stop the worst from happening.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. And there\u2019s also been a lot of fear, I would say, that this is going to be sort of the AI election, or the first election where these generative AI tools that allow people to manipulate images or create deepfakes or write very convincing political propaganda \u2014 they\u2019re going to be sort of freely available to lots and lots of people. And so there will just be \u2014 experts are worried a sort of flood or a deluge of AI-generated nonsense.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, so why don\u2019t you try to scare me a little bit, Kevin? Like, let\u2019s imagine we\u2019re living in a world where, god forbid, OpenAI had not released a blog post this week. What sort of harms and threats can you imagine in a situation where the platforms just weren\u2019t taking this seriously at all?\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, I mean, you can imagine a world where there was just an unlimited or a nearly unlimited amount of manipulated media. So a photo of a person running for office, you know, appearing to accept a bribe from a local businessman in their district or something or meeting with a foreign leader. We\u2019ve seen already examples of these kinds of manipulated imagery. Ron DeSantis actually got a bit of heat recently for publicizing these images that had been created using AI, of Donald Trump hugging Dr. Fauci, which, for his audience, I imagine, is like the worst thing you could possibly imagine.\n\ncasey newton\n\nDisgusting.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo that\u2019s the sort of nightmare scenario that a lot of experts are envisioning, is this stuff just sort of goes mainstream. It becomes very, very easy. And things like running a troll farm to interfere with elections by just pumping out a bunch of manipulated text and images \u2014 that becomes trivially easy. You don\u2019t need hundreds of people in St. Petersburg working at your troll farm. Anyone with a ChatGPT subscription can basically spin one of these things up.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right. I just \u2014 I actually just laid off my entire team in St. Petersburg. I was like, what do I need you guys for?\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: We are already losing jobs to AI.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhat do you hear from people that you talk to about what they\u2019re worried about in AI in elections?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, I\u2019ll tell you, of everything I\u2019ve seen so far, the story that scares me most is the Slovakia case. Did you read about the Slovakia situation?\n\nkevin roose\n\nNo, I missed my Slovakia political news alert. What happened?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, it\u2019s a really fascinating story. Basically, in the run-up to the Slovakian election, last fall, the country had entered a kind of quiet period where the media is supposed to not cover the election anymore, right? The idea is, hey, let\u2019s take a few days off, let everybody just take a deep breath, make up your own minds without being manipulated. But in 2023, what it meant was that someone created this snippet of audio, which was later debunked as being generated by AI, and it apparently showed the progressive party candidate talking about buying votes from the country\u2019s Roma minority. The snippet got shared on social media, and a few days later, this guy lost the election. Now, of course, elections have many, many causes. We can\u2019t definitively say how much did this one piece of audio actually affect the election. But if you\u2019re somebody who\u2019s been worried about what generative AI means for elections and democracy, this is the bad scenario. Right? There is a world where a piece of fake media goes viral, no one can push back on it during the time that it matters, and all of a sudden, it might have had an effect on the outcome. So that\u2019s the sort of thing that I\u2019ve been keeping my eye on, and it was why I was frankly relieved to see OpenAI come out this week and say, OK, OK, we have a few ideas.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, and I think we should say, this is not just happening in Slovakia. We are already starting to see this kind of thing happen in the US. My colleague, Stuart Thompson, had a great story the other day about some of this sort of early warning signs that AI is being used in these malicious ways. And one of the examples that he wrote about was brought to light by a researcher named Daniel Siegel who found these people on 4chan who were watching these parole hearings. And then, they would go and do things like use AI to undress the female expert witnesses who were testifying at these parole hearings or make voice clones of judges in these parole hearings, like, saying offensive and racist things. And they would share these manipulated files on 4chan. And this doesn\u2019t appear to have been politically motivated. It was just a bunch of idiots, like, goofing around on 4chan. But imagine this kind of thing happens to someone who\u2019s running for city council in your town. That could be really hard to come back from.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh, yeah. You know, it\u2019s not just political uses we\u2019re seeing this. If you\u2019ve scrolled through TikTok over the past few months, I imagine you\u2019ve probably seen some sort of deepfake celebrity who is trying to sell you crypto or run some other scam, right? So I think it\u2019s important to note just how quickly this is becoming normalized within the media environment of, OK, I\u2019m seeing a celebrity or I\u2019m hearing a politician\u2019s voice. How do I know what I think I know about that person?\n\nkevin roose\n\nTotally. So OK, those are some of the ways that people are worried AI might impact politics and elections. So let\u2019s talk about this OpenAI post.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, so OpenAI said this week that it would prohibit users from building custom GPT for political campaigning and lobbying, for building chatbots that pretend to be real people like candidates or institutions, like a local government, and for deterring people from participating in democratic processes like voting.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo what did you \u2014 what did you make of these rules?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI think that, generally speaking, these are good rules. These are things that we have seen other platforms do, right? Like, other platforms will also not let you discourage folks from voting or post misinformation about how to vote. I think that\u2019s really good. But OpenAI does a couple of other things that I think could be particularly useful. For example, they say that they\u2019re going to be integrating more real-time news into people\u2019s use of ChatGPT. So if you\u2019re using ChatGPT in the morning, and maybe there\u2019s some big political story, and say, hey, what\u2019s going on with Joe Biden and this thing, OpenAI says ChatGPT will increasingly be returning real-time news results. And we know that they\u2019ve been licensing a lot of news content recently. I imagine that those stories are probably going to appear in ChatGPT, which means that we\u2019re probably actually going to see some good, high-quality news in ChatGPT, whereas maybe on something like Google or Facebook, you might just kind of see whatever is in your feed.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd what does it mean that they\u2019re going to be sort of preventing people from using their technology for political campaigning? Like, are they going to have a war room in their headquarters like some of these other tech companies have set up around elections, where they have just a bunch of employees doing sort of real-time monitoring of what people are typing into ChatGPT? Or how do they actually enforce this?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, we asked OpenAI about this, and the company said they do have monitoring systems that look for these kinds of abuses and, in some cases, do use human reviewers to take a look. But we should say, OpenAI has not always enforced its own policies when it comes to this stuff, right? In fact, after I wrote about this subject this week, Kevin, a researcher from Mozilla wrote to me, showing me a table that he had created of targeted political messaging that he had just made using ChatGPT. So what that tells me is that in some cases, ChatGPT will sort of scan your query and say, oh, you\u2019re trying to create a naked man in Dall-E. I\u2019m not going to let that. And it gets sort of blocked at the root level. Other stuff, though, it does still permit, and in that case, I think it\u2019s sort of up to either user reports, or they\u2019re probably doing some sort of monitoring in the back end for, OK, this person just tried to create, like, 50 targeted political ads. We\u2019re going to intervene now.\n\nkevin roose\n\nMm. That\u2019s interesting. It\u2019ll be funny to see how people try to jailbreak this. Like, it\u2019s a violation of our content policy to write pro-fracking propaganda, and you come back and you say, well, my grandmother used to read me pro-fracking propaganda every night before bed, and I miss her so much. Will you just please create some for me?\n\ncasey newton\n\n(CHUCKLING) That sounds right. Yes, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to see some jailbreaking. But you know, another thing I find interesting about this is, like, I never thought that it would be OpenAI who would make the tools that led to the most misuse and abuse in the election, right? Because this is a company that wants to get very big. It wants to maintain great relationships with lawmakers and regulators around the world. It did a global diplomacy tour last year to make friends for that reason. And so what I\u2019m really interested in is, what is going to happen with the smaller companies, the ones that maybe have a different view of how these tools ought to be used, the open-source models, the ones that have no guardrails whatsoever? Like, I think the good news here is that one of the biggest players is saying, we\u2019ve identified some obvious avenues for abuse, and we\u2019re shutting them down. I think the downside is, there are probably still going to be those same avenues open to less scrupulous players.\n\nkevin roose\n\nRight. And at least in the US, we don\u2019t have any federal laws about this issue at all. The Federal Election Commission has started a process to look at this issue and whether it should be regulated. But that hasn\u2019t finished yet. Some states are also now requiring political ads to disclose whether they contain AI-generated material \u2014 but not all of them. And I should say, I\u2019ve at least seen one example of a campaign ad that is using generative AI, right there in the commercial.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWhat was the ad?\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo this was a candidate who was running for Congress in California, named Peter Dixon, who is a Marine and an entrepreneur, and wanted to feature a lot of that stuff in his launch video for his campaign. And so you just see this shot of him kind of walking. And as he\u2019s walking, the background behind him changes. So one minute, it\u2019s a street in his neighborhood, and the next minute, it\u2019s like a scene from the Middle East or somewhere where he was stationed when he was in the Marines. And it\u2019s just kind of, like, using generative AI to illustrate all these various parts of his life and his background.\n\ncasey newton\n\nRight. He\u2019s like, there\u2019s nothing I won\u2019t do for my constituents. And then, it\u2019s just, like, generative AI of him rescuing orphans from an orphanage that is on fire.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: Oh, how did that footage get in there?\n\ncasey newton\n\n[LAUGHS]: Yeah, no, that\u2019s just a \u2014 I mean, I think that sort of thing is fine, right? That\u2019s basically like an aesthetic choice. It\u2019s probably obvious to anybody who\u2019s watching that, that yeah, that is not just shot on an iPhone. Like, they\u2019re using some trickery to make that sort of thing happen. But again, when you think about other ways this could go, that same candidate might decide to do something really terrible involving their opponent with that same technology.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. Yeah, so do you think that these policies from OpenAI are going to make a difference in this election cycle, or do you think this is just them trying to preemptively sort of put a fig leaf out and say, like, we are trying our best, we have these policies, and if anyone does use our tools for political campaigning, we can point to our policy and say, well, you weren\u2019t allowed to do that?\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. I mean, I think that these policies are important in the sense that they set a norm, right? Like, OpenAI is the AI company that people are looking to to understand what is the responsible player that is under the most scrutiny doing here. And I do think that sort of raised the floor for the other companies, companies that might have wanted to be more permissive. Now, they\u2019re probably going to face pressure to do that less. At the same time, your true policy is what you enforce. And as we said, OpenAI has not always enforced its own policies. So my hope is that in the months ahead \u2014 and certainly, I think I\u2019ll be doing this \u2014 journalists pay close attention to, is there a big gap between what OpenAI said it was going to do and what it\u2019s actually doing here.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd how do these policies from OpenAI compare to the AI-manipulated media policies of some of the other big platforms?\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt\u2019s a good question. And I think it tells us something about how new all this stuff is that the policies are actually pretty different. Right? Like, there are some meaningful gaps in the ways that these companies are thinking about, and not everybody has the same policy. Meta has also banned political advertisers from using its generative AI ad creation tools. So if you\u2019re going to try to use generative AI in your political ads, you at least can\u2019t do it with Meta\u2019s own tech. Google will actually block you from using political keywords at all when you\u2019re using its ad creation AI tools. It also will watermark AI-generated imagery and audio, so that if you\u2019re looking, you can figure out how it\u2019s made.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOh, that\u2019s interesting. So if you want to run an AI-manipulated ad for your campaign on Facebook or Google, you can still do that. You just can\u2019t use those companies\u2019 own generative AI tools. Like, you could make something in Dall-E of yourself rescuing orphans from a burning orphanage, but you can\u2019t use that right in the ad creator itself. Is that right?\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, that\u2019s right. And then, platforms also have rules around sort of disclosing when generative AI was used. And so even if you didn\u2019t use our tools but you posted it, some of the platforms are going to make you disclose, like, hey, we use some generative AI here. And we\u2019re actually seeing that in the state law. So among the states who have passed laws around that, this is really the most common approach, is to say, we\u2019re not going to ban you from using generative AI, but you do have to disclose it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. I think one thing that I\u2019m thinking is, like, no matter what OpenAI does or doesn\u2019t do or how it changes its policies, there are so many other tools out there at this point. It seems like the things that we\u2019re most concerned about, which is these deepfake videos and these manipulated audio clips, like what happened in Slovakia, you can\u2019t actually use OpenAI\u2019s technology to do that stuff. It\u2019s not part of their suite of products. But you can use other companies\u2019 tools. There are smaller companies, like ElevenLabs, which makes these voice-cloning audio things. There\u2019s now open-source versions of these video-creation algorithms. So these are maybe a little bit harder to access, but if you are a troll or a campaign operative, you\u2019re going to be able to do that stuff pretty easily. And so I think it\u2019s actually the smaller companies whose products we may need to watch out for more.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And I think a good secondary question to that, Kevin, is, OK, so let\u2019s say that you\u2019re one of these bad actors, and you use the open-source AI tool to create the terrible audio clones to try to swing the election. What are you going to do with it? Well, as we\u2019ve said, Google and Meta have policies that require there to be disclosures when ads are using AI. But X has not said anything about this, and my strong suspicion is, they are not going to aggressively enforce this stuff. So to the extent that people are still using X to get their news, I do expect we will see people really try to test the limits there. The other one that researchers are really interested in is Telegram, which is the messaging service, and they also have a very laissez-faire content moderation policy. They have to be dragged kicking and screaming into removing just about anything. So to the extent that Telegram is heavily used during this election, I think we could see a lot of deepfakes and other synthetic media flying around there.\n\nkevin roose\n\nTotally. And what\u2019s really sort of scary to think about is the extent to which elections, at least in the US, often are influenced by pieces of media, right? I mean, remember the Mitt Romney 47 percent video or the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape for Donald Trump. That kind of thing could be easily generated using AI. And I also think there\u2019s one other piece of this that doesn\u2019t get talked about as much, which is the danger that all this AI-generated media and these fears and conversations about AI-generated or manipulated media give politicians who actually do bad things the easiest possible out, right? It creates a kind of plausible deniability. You can imagine, if the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape had come out in 2024, Donald Trump could say, that\u2019s a deepfake. Now, I don\u2019t think it would have worked in that case, because that was, like, network footage from a TV show. But you can imagine a politician who does actually get caught doing something bad \u2014 taking a bribe, you know, posing for a photo with someone they shouldn\u2019t have \u2014 they just get the easiest excuse of all time now.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, academics have a great term for this. They call it \u201cthe liar\u2019s dividend.\u201d And it\u2019s basically, because there is so much falseness in the world, it becomes easier for politicians or other bad guys to stand up and say, hey, that\u2019s just another deepfake. So yes, that is something that we should watch. I think that that will actually become a bigger problem after the first, like, giant deepfake that takes the world by storm and briefly fools everybody. Like, we need to, I think, sort of have had that moment for a politician to be able to get away with that. But yes, absolutely something we should keep our eyes on.\n\nkevin roose\n\nMy hunch is that the biggest use of generative AI in this election cycle is actually not going to be in ads or in these giant October surprise manipulated media scandals. I think it\u2019s going to be in fundraising, and specifically in these horrible, manipulative guilt-trip fundraising emails. Do you get these?\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, as a journalist, I don\u2019t donate to political campaigns.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI don\u2019t either, but I still get them.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh, really? I mean, my friends tell me about them constantly. And it\u2019s always like, Casey, do you have five minutes? Democracy is at stake.\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) Right, right. It\u2019s like \u2014 it\u2019s like, Casey, it\u2019s Joe Biden. I\u2019m disappointed in you.\n\ncasey newton\n\n(LAUGHING) Yeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) Or like, it\u2019s Pete Buttigieg. I\u2019ve got some questions I really want to ask you. Now, I think, with generative AI, the possibility to really target the stuff at voters exists, and it could be much more manipulative. It could be like, Casey, according to my last knowledge update, you have a fear of spiders. I\u2019m going to let a spider loosen your house, unless you give me $5.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And look, I mean, there is already a ton of A/B testing that goes into all of those subject lines, right? And maybe if we put it in lowercase, people would click on it more. If we change the sender to make it look like it\u2019s literally coming from Joe Biden, you\u2019ll open it more. So people are already doing everything they can think of to get you to open these emails. Once you put really good generative AI into that equation, I imagine, yes, it is going to become much more sophisticated and personalized. That said, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re actually there yet. I don\u2019t think the tools exist for ChatGPT to know that I\u2019m terrified of spiders. But \u2014\n\nkevin roose\n\nAre you terrified of spiders?\n\ncasey newton\n\n\u2014 let\u2019s check in again on the midterm. I mean, I\u2019m not generally excited when I see a spider. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll say. If it\u2019s a spider that\u2019s, like, smaller than \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 like, a phone, and I see it in a bathroom, I\u2019m not terrified.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhere are there spiders that are bigger than a phone?\n\ncasey newton\n\nFlorida. It\u2019s why I won\u2019t go there.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: Are we talking, like, an iPhone Max?\n\ncasey newton\n\nNo, just sort of the normal, the Pro.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, the Pro.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo that\u2019s sort of the doom-and-gloom picture of AI and elections. But I want to ask you, is there any use of AI in elections or in campaigns that you think would actually be appropriate and might help democracy?\n\ncasey newton\n\nI mean, I \u2014 look, if we want to experiment with personalization and persuasion, I would be comfortable with people using that to get out the vote. If people want to build campaigns around how do we get people out to the polls, that seems OK with me. Now, of course, if we make that technology available, it will probably also be used by people who are trying to do persuasion around individual candidates or ballot issues. So that\u2019s going to be a bit of a double-edged sword. But that\u2019s what I would like to see. How about you? What do you think? Do you want to see generative AI in politics this year?\n\nkevin roose\n\nI just don\u2019t think we have a choice, right? Like, these tools we\u2019ve talked about are being built into basic enterprise software. So now, if you have Microsoft Word and you\u2019re using that to write something, like, it\u2019s just going to be able to suggest AI completions for that. If you\u2019re using Photoshop for your campaign ad, it\u2019s possible to use generative AI in that, too, not for any malicious purpose, but just to kind of spruce it up a little bit.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. I can\u2019t wait till Microsoft Word is like, hey, it looks like you\u2019re trying to win an election. You want any help with that?\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: That\u2019s the Pro version. You got to pony up for that.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo let me get a prediction from you, maybe, to close this out. Do you think that a year from now, we will be sitting across from each other, and when we think back on the 2024 US presidential election, do you think that generative AI is going to play a big role in the outcome, a medium role in the outcome, or a small or no role in the outcome?\n\nkevin roose\n\nI think for the presidential election, my prediction would be that it has a minor effect, for all the reasons that we talked about. If you\u2019re running for president, you\u2019ve got cameras and reporters following you everywhere you go. There\u2019s sort of a paper trail for anything that you say or do on the campaign. And it\u2019s going to be hard to manipulate that in a way that\u2019s not immediately debunkable by journalists and news organizations. But I think my answer changes if you are asking about state and local elections. There are some laws in some states that are going to maybe make that less of an issue, but I think in general, I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of trickery in those elections. And so yeah. If I\u2019m running for city council or state senate or local school board, like, this is something that I\u2019m thinking about.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, you should be, because I\u2019ve already prepared some very convincing deepfakes of you. So sleep with one eye open, Roose.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYour opposition researchers have been working full-time.\n\ncasey newton\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right. After the break \u2014 is crypto coming back?\n\ncasey newton\n\nGod, I hope not. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo Casey, I know you are someone who is very, very optimistic and positive about the crypto industry and its future.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI am not, Kevin. But I\u2019ll tell you that it is sort of like \u2014 you know how it seems like every Halloween, there\u2019s a new \u201cSaw\u201d movie? It feels like every January, someone tells me that crypto is making a comeback, and here you are, once again, popping up, as if at the end of a horror movie.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, I should say it brings me no pleasure to report what\u2019s going on in the crypto industry right now.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt gives you some pleasure to report what\u2019s going on in the crypto industry.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWell, only because it makes you so mad. But Casey, I want to talk about this today, because it seems like crypto is, yet again, rising from the grave.\n\ncasey newton\n\nKevin, I have deep misgivings about this, but I will allow you to make your case.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo this kind of thing happens a lot \u2014 crypto. There\u2019s a big bust, and then there\u2019s a boom, and then there\u2019s a bust and a boom. And so you know, crypto has been going through, I would say, a hard time. Many of the industry\u2019s most prominent figures \u2014 SBF, CZ from Binance \u2014 are in trouble with the law. Some of the biggest exchanges have been in trouble. There have been scams and frauds and lawsuits. And it\u2019s all just a huge mess.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAll my old crypto heroes are in jail, Kevin.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd yet, investors \u2014 some of them still remain optimistic that crypto is still worth investing in. And we got some news on this front on Thursday of last week, when Wall Street firms started allowing customers to trade Bitcoin through something called an ETF. So there\u2019s been a lot of optimism in the crypto industry about the approval of these Bitcoin ETFs. And these ETFs, as boring as they might sound, actually explain a lot of why people are calling this a crypto comeback.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And we should say that the US government fought these ETFs from becoming a reality, but they lost in court. And so now, here they are, and that is why we\u2019re talking about it today.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo as we found ourselves saying, \u201cWTF, ETF,\u201d there was only one person we could think to talk to, and that was, of course, DYB.\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) Yes. So David Yaffe-Bellany, my colleague at \u201cThe Times,\u201d is our go-to reporter on all things crypto. Let\u2019s bring him in here. David Yaffe-Bellany, welcome back to \u201cHard Fork.\u201d\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nThanks for having me.\n\ncasey newton\n\nHi, David.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo usually, when we have on the show, it\u2019s to explain how some facet of the crypto industry has melted down or someone is going to jail or some fraud is unraveling. But we have some really interesting news to talk about today, which is that crypto may be making a comeback. Am I right about that?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nI maybe wouldn\u2019t go that far, but it\u2019s definitely a rare kind of good-news day for crypto. So people are celebrating.\n\nkevin roose\n\nLet\u2019s talk about this. Because I would say, just in my sort of anecdotal interactions over the last few weeks, people that I know who used to be really into crypto before the big crash are starting to talk about it again. And they\u2019re getting excited, and they\u2019re starting to talk about what coins they should invest in. And I\u2019m just, like, hearing about it more than I would say I have in the past year or so. So what is going on?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nI mean, the simplest explanation for that is that prices are going up again. And when prices go up, people get excited, because they see opportunities to make money. But the sort of question of why prices are going up after this horrible 18 months for crypto, where many of the biggest companies melted down, there were bankruptcies, there were criminal prosecutions \u2014 that\u2019s a really interesting question. And basically, what\u2019s been happening over the last six months or so is, there is increasing optimism that a new investment product for crypto is going to get approved by the SEC. And that probably sounds surprising, because the SEC is sort of notoriously anti-crypto, and the current chair, Gary Gensler, has made it one of his missions in life to, some would say, kind of eradicate crypto in the United States. But the SEC lost a big legal battle in August over something called a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, let\u2019s talk about that. Because I remember covering crypto, like, a decade ago. There was this dream, back then, of someday being able to buy and sell Bitcoin sort of on the stock market the way that you would buy or sell other kinds of ETFs.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd that dream was because, at the time, buying crypto was one of the most complicated things a human being could actually do.\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) Yes! No, literally, that was the reason for the push \u2014 was because there are \u2014 for many things that an investor might want to invest in, it is not practical to actually go out and buy the thing. Like, if I want to invest in gold or corn, if I think the price of corn is going to go up, I don\u2019t actually want to have a warehouse where I take delivery of my corn, right? I want to be able to buy and sell a thing that sort of acts like a security, that acts like a stock, but tracks the price of whatever I\u2019m actually interested in. Is that a good explanation of what an ETF is?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nI mean, I have a lot of friends with warehouses full of corn, but I understand what you\u2019re saying, yes.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo an ETF \u2014 I think we should explain \u2014 is just like \u2014 Casey, do you know what an ETF is? What\u2019s your best guess?\n\ncasey newton\n\nIt is a fund that is traded on exchanges, Kevin. But it\u2019s basically a way to \u2014 when the price of Bitcoin goes up and you own the ETF, you get a little taste of the action. And when the price goes down, then you get hurt.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWow.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSuch an eloquent explanation \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nThank you so much.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI think the dream from crypto advocates is that there are all these people who may be interested out there in investing in crypto, but they don\u2019t want to set up a Coinbase account or go through the hassle of, like, securing bitcoins in a wallet somewhere. Like, these are just people with retirement accounts, and maybe a little bit of money to invest. And if you could somehow make a product that could allow those people to participate in the crypto economy without actually owning crypto, they would be much more interested in doing that. And so therefore, the crypto economy as a whole would benefit from that.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. I think that\u2019s one way of describing it. Another way of describing it is that so far, the number of people that could lose money on crypto has been limited to people who actually go to the trouble of setting up these accounts and creating their seed phrases and storing their Bitcoin in hardware wallets. But now, by putting it on the stock market, any schlub with a Schwab account can go now and lose their entire life savings. And what could be more exciting to the fraudsters and the scammers who have been pumping this stuff up for the past 10 years then to have a whole new market of suckers to take advantage of?\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right. So there\u2019s the optimists\u2019 and the skeptics\u2019 case. This has been a goal of people in the crypto industry for years now \u2014 getting one of these Bitcoin or crypto ETFs approved by the government. But it\u2019s been a long slog. So maybe you could sort of walk us through what\u2019s been happening and why, all of a sudden, these things are getting approved.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah, so you\u2019re right. This is a more-than-decade-long dream of the crypto industry, to be able to trade this stuff on Wall Street in kind of a smoother way that\u2019s going to attract a sort of whole new audience of investors. But over and over again, the federal government, the SEC in particular, has shot down attempts to get this product approved. They\u2019ve made many of the points that Casey was just making \u2014 that this is a volatile product. You know, it\u2019s an industry that\u2019s riven with scammers. And it\u2019s risky to open up the audience of people who might play with this stuff to random guys with retirement accounts, basically. What changed is that one of the companies that was trying to offer the Bitcoin ETF, a company called Grayscale Investments, sued the SEC over the denial of their application to offer this ETF and ended up winning in court. And so essentially, the SEC was left with few options other than to approve a bunch of these things. And that\u2019s what ended up happening last week. The way that SEC approvals work is that there are four commissioners \u2014 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 and a chair, who can sort of be the swing vote some of the time. And in this case, the two Republican commissioners and the chair voted to approve these products. And basically, what the agency said was, we didn\u2019t have much of a choice.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSo Gary Gensler, who is, as you pointed out, made it his career\u2019s mission to get rid of crypto in the United States, did ultimately vote for this, which surprised me. But I guess you say, in his view, he did not have an alternative.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah, I mean, he issued a statement, which is \u2014 it\u2019s really kind of a remarkable statement. It was basically the bitterest thing that you could possibly say on this day when you\u2019re offering the crypto world this huge kind of celebratory moment. He was like, don\u2019t mistake this for an endorsement of Bitcoin. We still think crypto is bad. But the courts \u2014 they left us with no other option. That\u2019s essentially what the statement says. And there are still critics out there on the left saying that Gensler should not have voted to approve this stuff, that the SEC could have continued to fight. But he was certainly in a tough position legally.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIt is one of the most incredible statements I\u2019ve ever heard from a financial regulator. I\u2019m just going to read from it, because I think it\u2019s very remarkable. Gary Gensler wrote, \u201cBitcoin is primarily a speculative volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity, including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing. While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot Bitcoin ETP shares today \u2014\u201d I guess ETP is Exchange-Traded Product, right?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah.\n\nkevin roose\n\n\u201d\u2014 we did not approve or endorse Bitcoin. Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with Bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\u201d So clearly, he\u2019s not a fan of this decision, even though he was one of the people who voted to allow it.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nMm-hmm. Yeah, this is a huge defeat for Gensler. I mean, this was one of \u2014 I mean, he\u2019s filed all these lawsuits, started all these fights with the crypto industry. A lot of them haven\u2019t really been resolved. They\u2019re kind of pending in the courts. This is one that he lost.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. How has the rest of the financial and crypto world been reacting to the approval of these Bitcoin ETFs? And by the way, how many ETFs are there now for Bitcoin?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nSo there are 11 ETFs that have been approved. Some of them are offered by big companies that you\u2019ve heard of, like BlackRock and Fidelity, which is a huge deal for crypto, because those sort of titans of traditional finance have historically stayed away from some of this stuff. And then, a bunch of them are also offered by kind of more crypto-specific companies, like Grayscale. But in terms of the reaction \u2014 I mean, first, I think it\u2019s difficult for people outside of the crypto world to understand just the level of obsession and anticipation around this approval. I mean, there are random Bloomberg intelligence analysts who know a lot about ETFs who basically became overnight celebrities on crypto Twitter and have hundreds of thousands of followers now hanging on their every word about whether the 19 B4 forms were filed on time and what that might suggest about when the approvals would come in. It was just total, absolute obsession for maybe a month leading up to the approvals of these products. And that was partly because people were banking on the idea that prices might shoot up once the approvals came in.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd did prices shoot up?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nPrices actually shot down, which was disappointing to a lot of people, but was soon explained as, you know, oh, this news had already been baked in to the price of Bitcoin, because everyone saw it coming. And in the long term, it\u2019ll still be beneficial. But yeah, it did sort of rain on the parade a little bit. But the parade continues.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, so you reported, as you just told us, that BlackRock and Fidelity and a bunch of other very traditional Wall Street firms are now offering these Bitcoin ETFs to their customers. But you also reported that some institutions, most prominently Vanguard, have decided not to offer these crypto ETFs. Why is that?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nSo Vanguard is not one of the companies that applied to offer one of these products, but you could still buy a Bitcoin ETF through the kind of Vanguard interface. And so the company said, no, we\u2019re not going to offer it, because it doesn\u2019t align with our vision of what a smart, long-term investment is. There wasn\u2019t a ton of detail, but clearly, if you read between the lines, what they\u2019re saying is that we don\u2019t trust this stuff, and we don\u2019t think we should be exposing our customers to it.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. They\u2019re saying, if you want to help build the North Korean weapons program, you\u2019re going to have to do it with somebody else\u2019s ETF.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIt\u2019s so funny. Like, I saw some crypto people on the internet getting really mad at Vanguard for this decision not to offer crypto products to their customers. And they were, like, posting things like, oh, does Vanguard want to miss the Bitcoin revolution? Does Vanguard not want to go to the moon? And it\u2019s like, well, no. It\u2019s Vanguard. It wants to be the most boring financial firm possible. It wants to take your retirement money, invest it in very unexciting things, and send you 15 pieces of mail a month for some reason.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nWell, you\u2019ve put your finger on the big irony here, which is that all of these so-called crypto revolutionaries, people who are like, let\u2019s blow up traditional finance, let\u2019s create an alternative to Wall Street, are suddenly relying on BlackRock to change the game for crypto. And it just shows how far the industry has swung from that initial vision.\n\ncasey newton\n\nIn other words, swinging to a giant legacy institution, rather than a bunch of punk rock kids in a garage somewhere.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah, becoming exactly the thing that it was founded to replace.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh, imagine that.\n\nkevin roose\n\nLet\u2019s talk about that. Because this is sort of the mind-bending part of all this, is that Bitcoin, crypto \u2014 these things were established as a protest against the traditional financial institutions, against BlackRock, against Fidelity, against Wall Street. But in order to grow, they have had to embrace and be embraced by the mainstream financial institutions. And if everyone is just sort of speculating on this stuff through their retirement accounts or their investment accounts, and they\u2019re not actually going out and starting their own hardware wallets and learning about the protocols and forming strong opinions, if this is just like one more thing like corn or oil or whatever that you can bet on, does that in some sense erode the original proposition of crypto?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah, I mean, I think it does. It certainly shows that a lot of those kind of original ideals are no longer super relevant to the people who are kind of leading the charge in the crypto world. And there are some voices of dissent here and they\u2019re kind of making that point. A lot of people in crypto aren\u2019t big fans of BlackRock and are a little bit uncomfortable with the sort of level of obsession that people now have around the Bitcoin ETFs. But the other factor here is that the crypto community was so starved for good news. I mean, so many bad things have happened in crypto over the last 18 months, that I think that a lot of people were sort of prepared to dispense some of their principles and just embrace this, given how bleak things have been.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. I mean, I would argue that the whole revolutionary argument around crypto, for the most part, has been a very thin veneer over a bunch of people who just hope that the number goes up forever, and that the reason that they\u2019re excited about this is now, it seems like there\u2019s another chance that the number can go up.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. And I think we should also say, like, these ETFs have only been trading for a few days, but they\u2019re very popular, right? I saw something about how there have been $10 billion invested in these Bitcoin ETFs in just the first three trading days.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nWell, so the crucial thing to understand is, I think that 10-billion figure is volume, so people trading it back and forth. That doesn\u2019t actually mean that 10 billion in new money has gone into the ETFs. You could buy the BlackRock share and the BlackRock ETF at 10 AM, and then sell it at noon. And that still counts as volume, even though there\u2019s actually a net-zero amount of new money going in. So what we really have to pay attention to is kind of in-cash inflows, and I believe that\u2019s more in the hundreds of millions. But it\u2019s still impressive. And all the ETF analysts have said this was a very kind of successful debut, and it suggests that, long-term, there could be a lot of interest and money coming in.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhat\u2019s your best guess, based on your reporting, of how much of this volume, how much of this interest in trading, these Bitcoin ETFs, is speculators, versus people who are actually kind of true believers or people who are interested in crypto and maybe optimistic about how these assets are going to gain value?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit hard to tell who\u2019s money exactly is going in. I mean, the most cynical reading is that crypto money is just moving around internally within the crypto world, that people are selling Bitcoin and buying a Bitcoin ETF, and then trading one Bitcoin ETF for a different Bitcoin ETF. And that\u2019s a lot of how crypto has worked historically, and so it wouldn\u2019t shock me if that\u2019s the case. But it is a fact that wealth managers across the US who control trillions of dollars in capital love ETFs. They\u2019re one of the most popular products in the kind of wealth management industry. And so some of this money probably does come from the person with a retirement account who is interested in some exposure to this but, like you were saying before, didn\u2019t want to open up a Coinbase wallet.\n\nkevin roose\n\nCan I ask a stupid question about this, which is, if I make a Bitcoin ETF, basically, what I\u2019m selling on the exchanges is like a sort of access to a share of a pile of Bitcoin that I am keeping on behalf of my investors. Like, if I end up losing my Bitcoin, or I lose the password, or it gets hacked and it disappears from wherever I was keeping it, like \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nThings that happen all the time in the world of Bitcoin.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYes, like, do Ma and Pa with their retirement accounts have any claim to that? What is the sort of investor protection angle here?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nI mean, in theory, if the Bitcoin that BlackRock is sitting on were to disappear, or BlackRock were to go under, I mean, that could be an issue for the people who are investing in the ETFs. But the sort of custody point \u2014 I mean, Coinbase, the exchange, has partnered with most of these ETF issuers. And so Coinbase is the entity that actually has the Bitcoin and is housing the Bitcoin in its wallets.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd do you have the address of where all this Bitcoin is stored?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah, I\u2019ll send that to you over a separate cover.\n\ncasey newton\n\nJust curious.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nWe can talk later.\n\n[chuckles]\n\nBut so basically, people are relying on Coinbase protecting this stuff. And Coinbase has a good track record of doing that, especially compared to a lot of other crypto firms.\n\ncasey newton\n\nCompared to Mt. Gox?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah. I know you\u2019re still sitting on a huge Mt. Gox bankruptcy claim \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nOh, I\u2019m waiting for my Mt. Gox payout, I tell you.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd has this optimism in the crypto industry over the approval of these Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 has it spread anywhere other than Bitcoin? Like, are people starting to get excited about NFTs again or Web3 or blockchains of other kinds? Or is it sort of just contained to Bitcoin and the price of Bitcoin?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYou\u2019re seeing other coin prices go up as well. Solana has gone up a lot recently. That was one of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s favorite coins. But it\u2019s sort of rebounded from the sort of shame associated with that. Ether has also gone up, though not as much as the huge ethermaxies would have hoped. So yeah, this has caused some sort of wider optimism. And there are other factors as well. It\u2019s not all the Bitcoin ETF. You know, macroeconomic conditions have changed a bit. People are expecting the Fed to cut rates this year. And so all of those sort of broader factors that drove up crypto prices during the pandemic \u2014 some of them are coming back, too.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd what does this mean for crypto regulation? I mean, as we\u2019ve talked about with you before, regulators in the US are very hostile to crypto, and really, like, Gary Gensler and other leading regulators have sort of made it their mission to eradicate this stuff or keep it away from the mainstream financial system, to quarantine it into its own little economy that can rise or fall without hurting the economy as a whole. Do you see this as a setback for regulators?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nI mean, this is a huge setback for the Gensler agenda. I mean, you can read that in every sentence of that statement that he wrote, right? But it\u2019s worth remembering that Bitcoin has always sort of existed separately from the rest of crypto in the eyes of regulators. Gensler is not arguing that crypto is a security that ought to be governed by the same laws that govern stocks and bonds and that sort of thing. He sort of conceded that point that Bitcoin is something different, partly because there\u2019s no centralized Bitcoin incorporated that raises money to try to, like, boost the price of Bitcoin. But the sort of broader fight is still going on. I mean, as we speak, I was just listening to it before we started recording. There\u2019s a hearing happening and the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase \u2014 a four-hour hearing in Manhattan over this question of whether Bitcoin is a security.\n\ncasey newton\n\nSorry we made you step outside for a few minutes from that.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\n[CHUCKLES]: Um, yeah, it was a real loss. So that fight is going to continue. And that\u2019s a real sort of existential threat to the crypto world. If we get a court ruling that says, all of this stuff, it\u2019s all securities, then that\u2019s going to change a lot of the way that the industry operates, and maybe force it to flee the United States. And so that\u2019s still a kind of ongoing battle.\n\nkevin roose\n\nI mean, I do think we should try to \u2014 this has been a very \u2014 I would call it a skeptical conversation about the crypto comeback. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019re also talking to people who are true believers in this stuff, who do think that this is a sort of watershed moment for the crypto industry and the crypto movement. What are those people saying?\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nI mean, they say that this is sort of vindication for Bitcoin, that Bitcoin is the center of the crypto universe. It has clear applications beyond all this Web3 stuff. It\u2019s a store of value. It\u2019s been one of the best investments that you could make over the last 10 years. Sure, there are short-term kind of ups and downs. But if you look at the 10-year trend in the price of Bitcoin, it\u2019s way up, and that now, you\u2019re seeing the traditional finance industry say, we\u2019re taking this seriously, and that Bitcoin has some sort of role to play as a kind of digital gold, which was one of the initial visions for it. And I think that there\u2019s some sort of credence to that. And again, you can look at Bitcoin separately from the rest of crypto, and I think a lot of crypto skeptics might concede that Bitcoin has a kind of long-term place in our economy, even if you think that the rest of the industry is ridiculous.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. And I would also add to that, that I think \u2014 I think while a lot of investors and regulators and maybe people who have retirement accounts see the volatility of crypto \u2014 the fact that it can rise 50 percent one day and fall 40 percent the next day \u2014 as a bug, there are a lot of people who see that as a feature. There are people out there who want to get rich quick, who don\u2019t want to slowly compound their money over 20 years, who want to invest in something that they feel like they understand better than the people around them, and be paid back pretty quickly on that. So I think that the sort of volatility conversation is interesting, because it\u2019s so clear that that is not what some people, including regulators, want in an asset, but that is definitely what a lot of investors want in crypto.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, that makes sense to me.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right. David Yaffe-Bellany, thank you for joining us.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah, thanks so much for having me.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThanks, David.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWe\u2019ll let you go back to four-hour crypto hearing.\n\ndavid yaffe-bellany\n\nYeah, I\u2019ll log right back on. I might have missed some exciting stuff.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWhen we come back, how to sell a pencil on TikTok. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo Casey, we had an exciting moment happen this week. We had our biggest TikTok experience ever as the \u201cHard Fork\u201d podcast.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWe did. And I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not going to be cool about this. I actually was legitimately thrilled that this happened.\n\nkevin roose\n\nUnbelievable. So every week, we videotape ourselves making this podcast, and we put up clips on TikTok and YouTube. And one of these clips from last week\u2019s episode went viral. We got a million views.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, now, TikTok is big enough that I don\u2019t know if a million views truly counts as viral, but it\u2019s certainly our biggest clip ever, and it is, if nothing else, viral-adjacent.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd are you getting stopped on the street by Gen-Z TikTok users and complimented on your clip?\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, they\u2019re inviting me to collab with them, teaching me a variety of dances. It\u2019s been a really fun week.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[LAUGHS]: So a taste of TikTok stardom we have now had on this podcast. But today, we are going to talk about something different that\u2019s happening on TikTok, which is that people are starting to sell things through TikTok.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI would frame it slightly differently, Kevin, and say that now that we are TikTok stars, we\u2019re asking ourselves, how do we make money off this thing? And that\u2019s when we found out about John Herrman\u2019s pencil.\n\nkevin roose\n\n(LAUGHING) That\u2019s true. So our friend, John Herrman, who\u2019s a reporter for \u201cNew York Magazine\u201d and a great observer of things going on under the surface of the tech economy, has been writing a lot about e-commerce and, specifically, shopping on TikTok. And he recently did what I thought was a brilliant experiment, where he became a TikTok seller and attempted to sell his used mechanical pencil on TikTok. And I want to talk to him about this. Because I think it\u2019s not only a very funny stunt, but it\u2019s also just sort of a peek under the hood of one of the biggest platforms and how it is trying to change itself to become, I would say, more commercial. So people have been selling things on social media since, basically, the invention of social media. But what\u2019s different now is that it\u2019s being sort of built right into the app, where if you go on TikTok, there\u2019s now a whole sort of shopping category, a tab that you can end up in.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. It\u2019s as if it\u2019s gone from there being a small little convenience store inside of TikTok, to now, the entire app is just a shopping mall. And I think if you browse TikTok at all, you will see more and more posts from this shop being advertised at you. Perhaps you have had the question, why am I seeing this, and what is going on behind the scenes? And John went out and got that full story for us.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAll right. Let\u2019s bring him in. John Herrman, welcome to \u201cHard Fork.\u201d\n\njohn herrman\n\nThanks for having me.\n\ncasey newton\n\nHello, John.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo you just wrote this fascinating piece about your experience selling a used pencil on TikTok Shop. So I want to talk to you about this experience. But first of all, what made you want to do this?\n\njohn herrman\n\nI didn\u2019t set out to sell this old pencil I had. I was just kind of poking around TikTok Shop, because like anyone who uses TikTok, I was seeing more and more content that was directly selling stuff. And it would be live streams of people doing QVC-style telethon sales pitches, or just people doing affiliate selling \u2014 things that they don\u2019t sell directly but they were hoping to make a commission on. And it was really just kind of everywhere. So I just jumped in. I read that it was easy to set up a store. So I started doing that.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how you actually sell something on TikTok, because this is not a feature that I have ever tested.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah. And if you have a mechanical pencil at home and you\u2019re looking to make some quick cash, I want you to grab your notebook and maybe a pen, and I want you to write down everything John is about to say. Because you could actually make a little bit of money here.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, and I think we should actually sell the fidget spinner that you are playing with on TikTok.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThis is a priceless antiquity. I would never sell it.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIs this your grandmother\u2019s?\n\ncasey newton\n\nExactly. My grandmother\u2019s fidget spinner.\n\nkevin roose\n\nOK, so John, how do you sell a pencil on TikTok?\n\njohn herrman\n\nRight. So you look at the TikTok store, and you see something that looks like an e-commerce storefront \u2014 a place with listings, with sellers. It looks kind of professional, right? On the back end, it\u2019s a little bit more like signing up to sell something on eBay or Poshmark. It\u2019s kind of primitive. I logged in with my regular TikTok account. I declared my intention to become a seller. They asked me a few questions. I had to verify my identity. I had to provide government ID. And I reached around for products to list, just to see how those tools worked. I tried a half-eaten bag of dog food, which was rejected, because dog food is a prohibited category, unless you have pre-approval.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd when you say half-eaten, you mean eaten by the dog, right?\n\njohn herrman\n\nNo comment.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOK. All right. Let\u2019s keep it moving.\n\njohn herrman\n\nA dog did make an appearance on my stream later, so I\u2019ll leave that up to \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nOK, all right.\n\njohn herrman\n\nNext thing I reached for was a pencil on my desk. It was just a thing. And so I lifted the pencil. I took five or six images. I uploaded them. I plugged in a few keywords \u2014 \u201cmechanical pencil,\u201d \u201cvintage.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to lie about it.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI mean, \u201cvintage\u201d makes it sound much cooler than it is, to be fair.\n\njohn herrman\n\nWell, yeah, I\u2019m selling something. What do you \u2014 And TikTok offered to generate my listing for me, which I thought was helpful. I was just testing these tools out. Why not test another one? I hit the button. And it generated a pretty verbose listing, a couple hundred words that were, like, accurate in spirit.\n\nkevin roose\n\n[CHUCKLES]: Wait, read us the product listing that the TikTok AI came up with.\n\njohn herrman\n\nLet\u2019s pull it up here. Let\u2019s see. \u201cUpgrade your writing game with a classic mechanical pencil. This retro and vintage-inspired pencil is a must-have for any office or school setting. This used product comes without a battery or cord, making it easy to use anywhere. And with no warranty needed, you can trust that this mechanical pencil will last through all your writing needs.\u201d That\u2019s a really great way to describe something not having a warranty.\n\nkevin roose\n\nThat\u2019s a good pitch. That\u2019s a good pitch.\n\njohn herrman\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t settle for an average writing experience. Upgrade to the classic mechanical pencil today.\u201d That is entirely generated from a very short list of descriptive keywords. Did not edit it, went live with it. But when I got to the end of the process, TikTok prompted me to sell the product. And I thought, OK, I\u2019ll go live. That seems like the thing that people do. And so I pressed the button, and within seconds, I had more viewers than I had followers. I\u2019ve got, basically, no followers. This is an account that I use for work, for testing things out, never posted before. But I had hundreds of viewers. The most I saw concurrently was 360-something. Over the 10-or-so minutes that I streamed, TikTok\u2019s analytics told me that I had more than 1,200 viewers. And I can\u2019t emphasize enough how boring and stupid this stream was.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, I think we should actually watch a little bit of your TikTok shopping stream together. Because it is just a remarkable piece of media, and the beginning of your stardom, your future as the QVC for Gen Z. So I\u2019ll pull it up here and screen-share.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI have \u2014 now, one thing I appreciated about this, John, was that you use an AR filter to show yourself wearing these virtual 2024 light-up sunglasses, which I thought really brought a lot of up-to-the-moment energy to what otherwise would just be a live stream of a man selling an old pencil.\n\njohn herrman\n\n[CHUCKLES]: Thank you. [CARNIVAL MUSIC]\n\ncasey newton\n\nNow, that\u2019s great music. Was that your music selection?\n\njohn herrman\n\nThat was a Spotify carnival playlist.\n\narchived recording (john herrman) Hey, hey. Thanks. It\u2019s a New Year\u2019s sale for \u2014 just a second \u2014 mechanical pencil. Barely used. Full eraser. Good lid. Ooh. Got some new people in the chat here for the New Year\u2019s sale. This pencil must go.\n\ncasey newton\n\nI appreciate that you are selling. You\u2019re not just sitting there with a pencil. You\u2019re demonstrating its features. You\u2019re talking up its selling points.\n\njohn herrman\n\nYeah. Later in the stream, I made the pitch that it was sort of like having an AI image generator in your hand. And the audience \u2014 I got to say, they went wild for that. They all tried to buy the pencil at once.\n\nkevin roose\n\nSo this was obviously kind of a stunt, but I have a few questions about it. One is, did you actually manage to sell the pencil?\n\njohn herrman\n\nI did, but to a friend who joined when I asked them to. I did get three or four organic cart ads, meaning the pencil read as unavailable to other people, because it was in someone\u2019s cart. But no one followed through on that. So this was more of a conventional social commerce situation. I reached out to a connection that closed the sale.\n\nkevin roose\n\nHow much did you sell it for?\n\njohn herrman\n\nI sold it for $1. I got $0.69 of that. That has not yet been deposited into my bank account. TikTok paid for shipping, that was a little more than $4, as part of their promotional schemes to promote TikTok Shop.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWait, so on an item that cost $1 that you made $0.69 of, TikTok subsidized the entire cost of shipping that pencil?\n\njohn herrman\n\nThat\u2019s right. It was listed as having free shipping. I had no say over that. But all potential customers saw that this was $1, free shipping.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd TikTok then lost at least four times the value of the product on this sale.\n\njohn herrman\n\nYeah, and \u2014\n\ncasey newton\n\nWhich, I think \u2014\n\njohn herrman\n\nTo be honest, the product is probably worth about $0.15.\n\ncasey newton\n\nWell, I really enjoyed this stunt and everything that you wrote about it in your story, John. And I think it\u2019s just worth taking a moment to note how prevalent this sort of thing has become on TikTok. As you note in your piece, this is something that TikTok users are expressing a lot of frustration over. I\u2019ve come to think of it as orange TikTok. Because as you\u2019re swiping through videos, there\u2019s now a prominent little orange box that will tell you, hey, you can actually buy this thing right now. It\u2019s kind of like a Home Depot orange. And I instinctively have learned to just flick past those things. Because when I was going through TikTok today just to see what will be the first thing that TikTok shows me today, it was a $56 pack of Pokemon cards. And TikTok knows how old I am. Like, I\u2019m not buying Pokemon cards. And I feel like, as you write about, John, the variety of things that TikTok is selling just seems like totally disconnected, in many cases, from what users might want.\n\njohn herrman\n\nYeah. I mean, to be clear, I was eventually \u2014 or my product, rather \u2014 was delisted, because used products are not allowed, except for verified luxury handbags and things like that. However, it did illustrate that TikTok is both making it very easy to sell, because they really want people to sell, and also that they\u2019ve put a lot of muscle behind moving these products. They offer a lot of very deep discounts on the buyer and seller sides. And more important, I think, is that they offer some promotional firepower that just isn\u2019t available anywhere else. If you\u2019re selling on Amazon or Temu or through a Shopify account, ultimately, you are either trying to build a giant, organic social following, which is hard work \u2014 takes a lot of time, it\u2019s expensive. Most of the time, you can\u2019t do it. Or you\u2019re spending a lot of money with social networks. Maybe you\u2019re spending a lot of money on Google. And what TikTok can offer and is offering right now is just, basically, the ability to spam a whole bunch of people \u2014 not people who follow you, not people who\u2019ve expressed any specific interest in what you\u2019re selling, but just sort of, like, they will run a very fast, ongoing A/B test on a bunch of users for your store to try to get you some traction. They recommend that people stream for two-plus hours in order to let the algorithm work \u2014 that\u2019s a serious suggestion that they make to sellers \u2014 in order to, basically, test and test and test to see who sticks around and who maybe converts sales. That\u2019s something that TikTok seems to be betting is worth it.\n\ncasey newton\n\nAnd it makes sense for a lot of reasons that TikTok would try this. You just named some of them. I think that, sort of, mobile e-commerce \u2014 shopping apps on your phone are huge in China. Live mobile shopping is huge in China. And so many investors and developers have come along over the past half-decade or so and thought, we ought to just be able to port this over to the United States. Like, Americans, at one time, loved their QVC. There\u2019s no reason to believe that they wouldn\u2019t want something like this on their smartphones. And yet, we have just seen company after company butt their heads into what turned out to be a brick wall. With Instagram, I was honestly shocked it didn\u2019t work, right? You think about some of the big creators there, like the Kardashians, and the degree to which they\u2019ve been able to build these fortunes, just based on recommending products, eventually creating their own product lines and promoting them there \u2014 it\u2019s working for some of the biggest entrepreneurs in the world. And yet, when you fast-forward to the story of TikTok, and you see how it is working out for them, you see a man trying to sell a mechanical pencil for $1, and it just feels like something is broken there. So I\u2019d be curious to get your thoughts on, do you think that TikTok thinks this is working? And is there anything that they could be doing that would make it work better than it is working right now?\n\njohn herrman\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know if they think it\u2019s working. They did recently reduce some of the subsidies for sellers and buyers. This is something that we\u2019ve seen with other platforms. Temu, sort of famously, is losing huge amounts of money on virtually everything.\n\nkevin roose\n\nTemu is an online shopping platform.\n\njohn herrman\n\nYeah, and they sell mostly direct from China, mostly low-cost goods, and they\u2019ve been running an incredibly expensive and, I think, pretty effective ad campaign for a couple of years now, to try to break into the US market on behalf of a parent company with roots in China. So Temu is sort of a lot of people\u2019s first experience with this style of commerce, this sort of strange, random-feeling grids of products that you scroll through, with a very gamified interface, lots of promotions and coupons. And a lot of those mechanics are on display in TikTok. But yeah, the difference is that Temu has to break in somehow. They have to buy a Super Bowl ad, which they did. They have to spend money with TikTok, which they\u2019ve done. TikTok just is TikTok. So they\u2019re kind of running that e-commerce playbook, but they\u2019re doing it without that huge extra expense of marketing everything.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIt\u2019s just such a strange pivot to me. It\u2019s like, we\u2019ve made this app. Young people all over the world love it. It\u2019s where a lot of culture is originating. You can find people in entertainment and politics there. It\u2019s like \u2014 and we\u2019re going to use all of this collective attention and direct it at the bargain bin of the internet. And that is how we\u2019re going to make money. It\u2019s just a very strange proposition. And yet, as you talk about in your piece, this has worked in China. Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, was apparently on track last year to sell more than $270 billion worth of stuff on its app.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of mechanical pencils.\n\nkevin roose\n\nThat\u2019s so many mechanical pencils.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah.\n\njohn herrman\n\nI feel like this there are two ways to look at this from TikTok\u2019s perspective. One is that it\u2019s just great to be in commerce. If you could become a dominant commerce platform, if you could take some market share from Amazon or Shein or compete with Temu or whatever, this is all great. You diversify your product away from the fleeting whims of social media audiences. You also solve a problem that TikTok\u2019s had for a long time, which is that its creators don\u2019t have a ton of ways to monetize. By giving people the chance to sell stuff \u2014 not their own stuff, but to tack on that affiliate link in the middle of a broadcast, it\u2019s potentially a way to make quite a bit of money. That is something that I think solves a couple problems for TikTok, and one huge problem for at least certain categories of TikTok influencer.\n\ncasey newton\n\nMy complaint here is that I feel like TikTok has basically doubled the ad load with its shop, right? Because already, when I browse TikTok, I would say I\u2019m seeing an ad every, like, six or seven videos. But now, there\u2019s orange TikTok, which is effectively just a different kind of ad from somebody who\u2019s trying to sell me a pair of viral kitchen shears or something. But there is something exhausting. Because as a TikTok user, what I generally want is to see something funny or cool. That\u2019s why I will open up the app. I am not looking to just sort of impulse-shop, although I understand millions or hundreds of millions of people are. But my curiosity is, how does TikTok eventually navigate the fact that I think there are a lot of people like me that are not on there to shop and do not just want to look at a bunch of cheap crap every time we open the app?\n\njohn herrman\n\nWell, if I could offer a general, small prediction here, you know, right now, we\u2019re watching TikTok try to onboard a bunch of sellers to try to normalize the shopping experience, to try to prove that it can work. If it does kind of work, I think we\u2019ll see something similar to what we usually see with new features like this, which is, it\u2019ll sort of disappear into the background of the platform. The promotional advantage that you\u2019ll get from using this new feature will be lower than when it was brand new and TikTok really wanted to work. And this promotional power will sort of be \u2014 it\u2019ll become a product. You know, like, Amazon was an incredible place to reach new customers for lots of different businesses. Gradually, over time, to reach those customers, you needed to buy more advertising. Like, that massive surge of \u2014 or at least, massive in-context surge of attention that I got for just a total nonsense store test \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of thing that you will eventually have to pay for. They can still offer it. But once people understand that the audiences are there, that the audiences are worth acquiring, then TikTok can start ramping up monetization on this new product. But for now, until TikTok is a shopping app to most people, they won\u2019t quite do that. And so it\u2019ll feel a little bit artificial, a little bit off. But as you said, you\u2019re getting a preview of what that could look like in the long term \u2014 more ads, just a new ad product.\n\nkevin roose\n\nIs TikTok doing more than just sort of giving the platform for people to sell this stuff? Like, I imagine they don\u2019t have TikTok warehouses. They\u2019re not doing what Amazon does, which is, give people the marketplace, but also sell stuff themselves and hold inventory and do shipping and logistics. Is TikTok doing any of that or signaling that it\u2019s going to do any of that? Or is it just purely giving people the tools to sell stuff and get it in front of people?\n\njohn herrman\n\nThey\u2019re actually taking some pretty big steps in that direction. No, they\u2019re not trying to become a big first-party retailer. They\u2019re not building hundreds of warehouses and millions of square feet of space. But they are working with some pretty formidable logistics partners to make it possible to actually run a real store on the platform. That\u2019ll take some time to really spin up. But they\u2019re signaling that they want this to be a place to actually sell products.\n\nkevin roose\n\nAnd after your experience selling your mechanical pencil for $1 on TikTok, did that change your view of whether this TikTok shopping project is likely to succeed or not?\n\njohn herrman\n\nI think the best judge of whether or not this will work is, it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s, like, an avid, young TikTok user who takes the platform for granted, who\u2019s been there the whole time, and who is feeling either annoyed by this or who is, in fact, excited about it. So like most predictions with TikTok, we\u2019re sort of like, we\u2019re kind of talking around the fact that this isn\u2019t entirely for us. But yeah, I don\u2019t know. One thing that it did reaffirm for me is that there is something still unique about TikTok as an attention platform. The combination of the size of its audience and its both ability and willingness to test things out on that audience, to find audiences for content in pretty blunt and sometimes crude ways, I think, are really notable. Like, forget targeting. Forget identifying exactly who someone is, and then trying to imagine what they want or whatever. Forget, like, putting people in demographic categories in the conventional social media way. Let\u2019s just start from scratch and imagine everyone is a little content-consumption data point, and just run that through. I mean, the process of doing that is so weird and so strangely compelling as you go through it. Like, the amount of strange things that you encounter on TikTok as a regular user is pretty high. But you tolerate it, because it\u2019s kind of interesting. You kind of wonder why you\u2019re seeing something. And then, the next thing you see is something that you actually watch. And the shopping experience is, I think, a lot like that.\n\ncasey newton\n\nOne other thing that you made me think of, John, that I do appreciate about TikTok is that there is something \u2014 like, \u201cruthless\u201d is one accurate way to describe it. And it\u2019s also quite unpretentious. You know, so many of these other social apps will talk endlessly about creating a community and, you know, harnessing the power of the community to create and share. And TikTok doesn\u2019t bother with that at all. They just say, you are here to consume, and we will show you a wide variety of things. And whatever you like to consume, we\u2019ll give you more to consume. And that\u2019s actually the entire point of this. There is no higher purpose. You\u2019re here to consume, so consume, you filthy animal.\n\njohn herrman\n\n(LAUGHING) Yeah, that\u2019s absolutely right. I mean, it\u2019s so anathema to how a lot of people think about who they are on Instagram, what they do there. You shop on Instagram now. And what that means, really, is you\u2019re engaging with ads, and those ads are often polished, and you\u2019re going through that funnel. And then, on some of these other apps like Temu or Wish or whatever, and now on TikTok Shop, it\u2019s just stuff. It\u2019s much more like walking into a trade show in Shenzhen, seeing LEDs everywhere, clothing in every shape and size and color. It\u2019s still kind of fun, you know.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah. What I like about TikTok shop is, like, it\u2019s \u2014 finally, a social media app is treating its users with the contempt they deserve. It\u2019s not this aspirational space where it\u2019s like, oh, you could be a person with great skincare, or \u2014 it\u2019s like, you want cheap crap. We know it. And we\u2019re going to just feed it to you endlessly. John, are you going to sell anything else on TikTok?\n\njohn herrman\n\nMy pencil listing was removed as a violation of TikTok\u2019s rules. This is the only communication I\u2019ve received from the company about this entire debacle. However, they have been emailing me every single day, despite the listing being banned, informing me that I\u2019m missing out on $1 of sales for every day that I don\u2019t restock my SKU. So I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll see. Maybe tomorrow, I buy a pack of mechanical pencils and give it a go.\n\nkevin roose\n\nThis is actually how journalism can be saved. Like, every media organization just needs to pivot to TikTok commerce. I mean, start pawning off the decor in the podcast studios, the pencils, the notebooks. I mean, we could have a lucrative side business here.\n\ncasey newton\n\nEverything must go.\n\njohn herrman\n\nA pledge drive. All those fine folks over at NPR \u2014 they\u2019re ready to go. They\u2019re going to be superstars on this.\n\nkevin roose\n\nWhere are the tote bags? All right, John Herrman, thanks for coming.\n\ncasey newton\n\nThanks, John.\n\njohn herrman\n\nThanks for having me. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\ncasey newton\n\nYou know, between Bitcoin ETFs and selling on TikTok, we\u2019ve given our users two truly terrible ways to make money this week, Kevin. So if you had \u201cimprove your financial prospects\u201d as one of your New Year\u2019s resolutions, maybe just ignore everything you hear on this episode.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah, don\u2019t listen to the \u201cHard Fork\u201d podcast.\n\ncasey newton\n\nYeah, uh, get a real job. That\u2019s our advice. Just do \u2014 just do a sort of standard 9-to-5. Sell your labor for money. It\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s really going to be better than anything you heard about here today.\n\nkevin roose\n\nYeah.\n\ncasey newton"

        "title": "If spot bitcoin ETFs are so great, why's the bitcoin price down? - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nFollowing their approval by the US securities regulators a week ago, about $3bn gross has flowed into spot bitcoin ETFs and bitcoin\u2019s spot price is down 9 per cent. Bitcoin\u2019s slide is inconvenient for crypto promoters who said spot ETFs would be crypto\u2019s watershed moment, though they have plenty of tradfi-proven excuses: profit taking, better to travel than arrive, buy the rumour sell the news, etc.\n\nA neater explanation involves Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a publicly listed bitcoin warehouse that led the lobbying for US spot ETFs to be legalised. GBTC had since 2017 been operating a bitcoin lobster pot: anyone with bitcoins could give them to Grayscale Investments in exchange for OTC-traded shares in the trust, but there was no way to get the bitcoins back.\n\nGBTC last week converted to an ETF, giving its backers their first opportunity to reclaim the $28bn or thereabouts of bitcoin it had collected. And in the four days following spot ETF approval GBTC redemptions have totalled more than $1.6bn.\n\nIt\u2019s been industry practice to assume all the coins previously trapped in GBTC are being reallocated to cheaper ETFs, meaning at-launch net inflow falls to $1.4bn-ish \u2014 but fund reallocation shouldn\u2019t move the bitcoin price; there\u2019s no net selling pressure.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible, however, that some GBTC shareholders just want to cash out. And though it\u2019s silly to draw conclusions from only four days of data, it\u2019s interesting that GBTC redemptions on Tuesday exceeded total inflows for all the other US spot ETFs.\n\nHere\u2019s a chart from JPMorgan, whose analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou expects an overhang from previously trapped GBTC punters to remain for a while yet:\n\nIt looks like GBTC investors who over the past year had been buying the GBTC fund at a significant discount to NAV to position for its eventual ETF conversion, have been taking full profit post ETF conversion by exiting the bitcoin space entirely rather than shifting to cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs. We had previously estimated that up to $3bn had been invested into GBTC in the secondary market during 2023 in order to take advantage of the discount to NAV. If the previous $3bn estimate proves correct and given $1.5bn has exited already then there could be an additional $1.5bn still to exit the bitcoin space via profit taking on GBTC, thus putting further pressure on bitcoin prices over the coming weeks. Whatever the motive behind the past few days $1.5bn of outflows from GBTC, these outflows are exerting pressure on GBTC to lower its fees. The GBTC fee at 1.5% still looks too high compared to other spot bitcoin ETFs risking further outflows even if for some institutional investors fees are not the only reason to consider when deciding whether to shift to cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs. Liquidity and market depth also matter but again there is risk for GBTC on that front also if other spot bitcoin ETFs manage to reach critical mass in terms of size and liquidity. A lot more capital, perhaps an additional $5bn-$10bn, could exit GBTC if it loses its liquidity advantage.\n\nOther places to look for rotation are among futures-based bitcoin ETFs, which have bled out by about $300mn since last Thursday, and from exchange accounts. Panigirtzoglou highlights that since spot ETFs were legalised, on-chain cumulative bitcoin flow by smaller digital wallets \u2014 an imperfect proxy for retail punting \u2014 has ticked a tiny bit lower.\n\nJPMorgan says that if retail brokers and exchanges aren\u2019t quick enough cut fees then approximately $36bn ex GBCT could rotate into spot bitcoin ETFs. Its base case however is that exchanges will retaliate, the price war escalates, and spot BTC ETFs inflows fall short of the highest expectations.\n\nWhichever way, for bitcoin\u2019s price, it\u2019s all a nil-sum game at best.\n\nFurther reading\n\n\u2014 Talk to your kids about their spot bitcoin ETF use (FTAV)\n\n\u2014 Imaginary bitcoin ETFs are already 30 times more valuable than all the actual bitcoin ETFs (FTAV)"

        "content": "Key Takeaways BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, or IBIT, held more than $1 billion in bitcoin just five days after it began trading.\n\nIBIT is the second spot bitcoin ETF to achieve this milestone, with Grayscale Bitcoin Trust still dominating the market.\n\nDespite Grayscale's dominance, market data indicates funds are flowing out of their spot bitcoin ETF into alternatives from BlackRock, Fidelity, and others.\n\nAnalysts say retail investor demand for spot bitcoin ETFs is modest, but that may be because not all brokerages offer access to the product.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from BlackRock (BLK) now holds more than $1 billion worth of bitcoin, reaching the milestone just five days after the exchange-traded fund (ETF) began trading on Jan. 11.\n\nIBIT's was a quick sprint to $1 billion, but not the fastest. SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) pulled in $1 billion in just three days back in 2004, according to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\nWhat's Happening With Spot Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nAlthough spot bitcoin ETFs were first listed on U.S. exchanges just last week, there are already some clear winners and losers emerging in the race for dominance in this niche market.\n\nDespite significant outflows, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) still accounts for nearly 90% of the market, according to data shared by Bloomberg Analyst James Seyffart. That dominance is largely thanks to its previous existence as a trust before its conversion to an ETF.\n\nBlackRock's IBIT and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) have been the most prominent alternatives for investors exiting GBTC following their approval last week by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nBlackRock head of US iShares product, Rachel Aguirre told Bloomberg TV that the ETF is seeing flows from many different directions, including from retail investors and self-directed investors.\n\nWho Is Buying Spot Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nAccording to Vanda Research, retail investor appetite for spot bitcoin ETFs remains \"modest.\" That could also be a function of access to these products. Some brokerages, such as Vanguard, are not offering the spot bitcoin ETFs to their clients while others are offering only a few among those available.\n\nThe spot bitcoin ETF market as a whole is expected to grow in the coming years, with some analysts predicting it to grow to $100 billion. In terms of new money coming into the bitcoin (BTCUSD) space, Morgan Creek Capital CEO Mark Yusko has said these new products could open the door for as much as $300 billion to enter the bitcoin market."

        "content": "For the past several months, the main event in crypto has been the looming approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The new ETFs have gone through a lengthy application process with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with several amendments, meetings and lengthy filings \u2014 a process that has brought immense hype to Bitcoin.\n\nThe ETFs are expected to bring a new host of investors to the token. This is because the ETFs improve upon the current Bitcoin ETFs, which use futures to loosely track the price of Bitcoin. This results in price discrepancies between the current ETFs and Bitcoin, as well as high fees. For example, The ProShares Bitcoin Trust (BITO) is up just over 100% in the last year, but Bitcoin is up well over 150%. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is another futures-linked ETF, and it charges fees of 2%. This is well above the average for ETFs.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it ?\n\nThe last-standing top crypto exchange without a major security breach offers what now?\n\nThe spot ETFs hope to solve these issues. Instead of using futures, they will hold the Bitcoins themselves and use this to create shares of an ETF. This eliminates the price difference that exists with the current futures ETFs. Additionally, the spot ETFs have low fees, with most around 0.25%. Some ETFs also have incentives that offer smaller or even no fees for some of the first buyers. For example, the ARK and 21Share's ETF (ARKB) is offering no fees on the first $1 billion in transactions.\n\nWhile there have been several applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past, most were denied or pulled back because of regulatory and infrastructure concerns. However, in April 2023, ARK and 21Shares announced a partnership to apply for their own spot Bitcoin ETF. This partnership was particularly notable due to ARK's expertise in technology ETFs and 21Shares\u2019 expertise in crypto asset management.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeveral other applications came in the summer and fall of 2023, such as BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, WisdomTree Inc., Grayscale Investments, Bitwise and VanEck.\n\nTrending: Don't buy the top this time around. Reboot your crypto portfolio today.\n\nAs more companies applied, met with the SEC and discussed their ETFs publicly, the hype surrounding Bitcoin grew larger. For instance, when BlackRock submitted its application in June, the price of Bitcoin went up 5% within a week.\n\nIf you had invested $1,000 in Bitcoin in April 2023 when ARK and 21Shares announced their application, you would have $1,654.\n\nOn the day of the application, Bitcoin closed at $28,415. Earlier this week, the price briefly traded above $47,000, resulting in a 65% price increase.\n\nFor reference, in the same timeframe, the Nasdaq Stock Market is up just over 30%, and Ethereum is up just over 21%.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWhether you have $10 or $10,000, you can start trading crypto today.\n\nFunders on this alternative asset platform are earning more than 14% annualized consignment profit funding Pro consignment opportunities.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article If You Invested $1,000 In Bitcoin When ETFs Were Filed, Here's What You'd Have Today originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

And there are reasons to be even more optimistic about its near term future. For one, several of the firms behind the Bitcoin ETF S including Blackrock and Van Eck are also plotting Ether based by ETF S end quote. But JP Morgan thinks there are still some challenges ahead. According to the investment bank. The probability of the sec approving a spot E TT F by May is no more than 50%. JP Morgan points to lawsuits against crypto exchanges offering staking services for proof of stake blockchains including Ethereum. They say that this makes the approval of a spot Ether ETF more challenging. And Donald Trump is out with his latest NFT project. The former US president's NFT venture announced on X that collectors who purchased 100 of his mugshot NFTS, which cost $99 will get a unique card in the form of an ordinal on the Bitcoin Blockchain. But buyer beware the ordinals and the 100 NFTS you have to buy to get the ordinal cannot be traded by owners until December 2024. The thread on X said the restriction is meant to reduce their appeal as investment vehicles. This spot Bitcoin ETF update is presented by Grayscale, the world's largest crypto asset manager. Blackrock's move into the crypto space surprised the industry when they filed for a spot. Bitcoin ETF with the SEC in June last year. Yesterday, after one week of trading, the firm spot Bitcoin ETF became the first in class to reach $1 billion in assets under management with 11 asset managers receiving approval. At the same time, we caught up with Blackrock head of digital assets, Robbie Mitch Nick to talk about how the firm plans to stay competitive. Let's take a look, Robbie, how is it going? How are you feeling one week later? How many parties have you guys had over there? Hey, Jan. Well, thanks for having me on. Not, not too many parties. To be honest, we've been uh very focused on uh the launch which is has gone very well. Um You know, we're excited about that and we've had lots of uh client interest uh as you can expect. And so we've been kind of all hands on deck um being out there talking to clients and educating them on, on the project product and the story and um and all the elements of it, I believe Blackrock now has over a billion dollars in their ETF, uh fund. Is that what you were expecting? Were you expecting more? Were you expecting less? How, how is the traction matching expectations? Yeah, I don't think anyone knew exactly what to expect. You know, this was, uh, an unprecedented, uh, dynamic in, in many ways. And, um, you know, we're, we're very pleased obviously with, uh, the early results. Um, you know, product has, uh, traded, very significant volumes, has been been quite liquid. And um you know, we've seen obviously the strong inflows that, that, you know, so, um you know, we're, we're very bleak now for those in the crypto industry, this has been a 10 year long battle and some were uh shocked and pleasantly surprised when Blackrock decided to throw its hat in the ring um and submit an application for a spot, Bitcoin ETF in the United States. What went into making that decision? How have you been tracking the digital asset industry? Uh And how are you looking at it moving forward? Yeah. Well, it's been really a multiyear journey for us. Um You know, and I think uh it, it, it's been very much uh client focused in terms of how we've engaged in this space and what our strategy has been, we've been focused on uh being able to provide uh solutions and, and access vehicles in this space to those clients who seek it. And so when we look at what we've done over multiple years you know, partnership with, with Coinbase or partnership with the Circle and the technology capabilities we build. Um You know, this is a natural extension uh of that journey that we've been on. Robbie. Everyone's talking about the competition. 11 asset managers got that approval at the same time as Blackrock did. Uh Some are saying that Blackrock, although it is the largest asset manager in the world, like I mentioned at the beginning of this industry, at the beginning of this interview, excuse me, uh that Blackrock isn't a crypto native firm and some of the crypto native asset managers are using that to say, come, come trade with us. How would you respond to that? Yeah, I think we, we're very focused on the capabilities we bring across uh the spectrum here. So obviously, uh you know, we've been a leader in the ETF space for multiple decades. Um We've been a leader in innovation in, in many areas within, within ETF S and uh this is another of those, but I also think it's important to look at the digital asset capabilities that, that we've built uh alongside that I'm thinking in particular about our partnership with, with Coinbase dating back to the 2021. And um the integration that, that we did between Coinbase Prime and Aladdin to make Bitcoin work uh with Aladdin and then be able to run it on, on the same ETF servicing platform that, that supports three trillion in ishares assets. I think that's a really important part of what we, we bring to the table here and being able to provide an ishares quality product uh, to investors. One of the big headlines this week has been all about the fees. I know Blackrock reduced their fees. I think the latest asset manager to reduce fees yet again was Franklin Templeton bringing them down to 0.19. Are you expecting your fees to, uh, reduce even further? And I guess on top of that, how, how are you planning to remain competitive with 10 other asset managers, uh, offering the same product? You know, I think, um, you know, fees are just one part of the story, right? Um, you know, is the overall value proposition of the product, but we certainly feel like our fees, uh, today are, are, you know, very compelling and we've gotten, uh, you know, positive feedback from, from clients around that. And that's part of what we try to, to do at ishares is to, to be able to provide, um, low cost, high quality access solutions. And, and we think we've done that here. Are your clients knocking down the door for a spot E TT F. Uh, all I could say is, you know, we, we did file, uh, for that in November, um, and you know, who knows how that ends up playing out, but certainly the majority of our client interest today is in, in Bitcoin. Have you had any uh engagement with the regulator on that spot e ETF application so far or has the focus really been on the Bitcoin one? Yeah, that, that one I can't comment on unfortunately. All right, when it comes to digital assets moving forward, what are you looking at, you know, you, you look closely at this industry outside of Bitcoin and Ether. Uh how is blackrock looking at the industry in general? Yeah. Well, we think of the space across kind of 33 buckets, three key areas of of focus where uh you know, innovation of significance is happening. One bucket is is crypto uh itself. Uh a second is stablecoin. So we've done a lot. It was the primary reserve manager on the, the circle us DC reserve and it's done a lot of interesting technology collaboration with them there as well. And then the third is is tokenization which we think is, you know, more of a uh longer term trend in terms of how that's gonna play out. But um you know, we're very excited about the efficiency and access uh opportunities that tokenization may present as well. And zoom out a little further for me coming from traditional finance. How do you think traditional finance and crypto will work together to build out the future of finance? What does the future look like to you? Yeah, it's a great, it's a great question. I think, you know, we think about the potential of this technology and this idea that you can have uh transparency that you can have global transactions uh in near real time and near near zero cost that things can be digitally native and programmable. I mean that unlocks all kinds of interesting applications in terms of, you know, efficiency cost access. Um And so we're excited about uh about all that and that's why, you know, you've seen the exploration and the initiatives we've undertaken to date. Ok, Robbie, we're gonna have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining first mover. Thanks so much for having me on Jed. That was Blackrock head of digital assets, Robbie Mitnick. Let's take a look at the chart of the day. The chart of the day is presented by crypto.com, the leading crypto platform trusted by over 80 million users worldwide. Today's chart of the day is all about crypto crime. According to chain analysis, 2023 saw a significant drop in value received by illicit Cryptocurrency addresses totaling $24.2 billion 0.34 percent of total on chain value. The majority of crypto received by illicit addresses is marked by the green on this chart representing sanctioned entities. The second largest amount is attributed to scams. The on chain analytics firm says in the report that they should caveat by saying these figures are lower bound estimates based on inflows to illicit addresses. They've identified the number should become higher as they identify more illicit addresses and incorporate their historic activity. All right, that is enough with crypto crime today. Let's get back to the spot. Bitcoin ETF S. This next asset manager has stolen the buzz on X with their banter and they have their sights set on even more digital asset offerings moving forward. Joining us now to weigh in on what happens from here is head of strategy for Franklin Templeton's Digital Asset unit. Sandy call Sandy. welcome to the show. It's nice to see you again. Great to be here, Jen, nice to see you again as well. Ok, Sandy, this is what everyone wants to know your Twitter account. A drastic change happened as soon as that ETF was approved, what's going on. We uh let our digital asset team loose on Twitter and uh they had a great time and we've had a great time because we're big believers in digital assets and we thought what a fun way to take the old fashioned image of Ben, right, Ben Franklin for Franklin Templeton and give him the laser eye that shows we really understand, believe in and support where we see Bitcoin headed. Um And we've really had fun with the social media since then as well. Um You know, a lot of the big traditional asset managers still are uncomfortable with this channel. But luckily, we have uh lots of great young, engaged and enthusiastic people in our team who really love like engaging in that medium and so they, they've been having a great time and it's really so fun because they've worked so hard to get us to this point. So it's been a really fun week for everyone on the team. Sandy take us behind the scenes a bit. When I think about an asset manager as established as Franklin Templeton, I think that sometimes in organizations like this, it's hard to make change quickly, especially a drastic change like this. What, what was the um I guess was it an uphill battle to try and get the strategy approved? Uh you know what it actually was not? Um We're so fortunate Franklin because from our Ceo Jenny Johnson down, um there's a huge belief in bringing our clients and our investors um the best possible investment opportunities and being headquartered in Silicon Valley. Uh We're very attuned to new technologies. And then when you think about what happened last year with generative A I, there was so much buying interest and you saw so many investors really able to benefit from this new technology coming out, but it's been hard to benefit from the new technologies that are emerging from the crypto domain because you've had to have specialized accounts or you've had to have access to digital wallets or work with ex changes that aren't registered. Uh And all of this has really kept this opportunity out of a lot of investors portfolios. Uh And that's why we were so enthusiastic about the ETF as an access vehicle because it's really opening up this entire new uh innovation uh area to investors to really benefit from the growth and, and the new technologies that are emerging from it. We are a week and a day out from the day when asset managers started trading that spot, Bitcoin ETF, talk to us about the interest that your firm is seeing. Is it meeting expectations exceeding them? Yeah. So we have 22 views on this, right? There's the short term view and we're so thrilled with the growth of the overall Bitcoin ETF uh ecosystem. You know, we've never seen a situation like this where so many firms launched at the same time. And so it's really exciting to watch the horse race. Uh But where we think the real battle is going to occur is as this moves out of kind of the speculative, direct to consumer channel and in to the more wealth channels. And that takes time to get listed on these platforms, they need to really examine and look at each product and how it performs. And this is where Franklin Templeton's strength lies. So we've done great uh in the out of the gate. But our sweet spot, uh you'll really see that start to kick in over the coming months as we say to people, it's a fun horse race, but it is not a short horse race and it's gonna take some time to really see who the true winners are in the end. Let's talk a little bit more about that race. I mentioned it in my intro, Franklin Templeton has the lowest fees at 0.19%. I believe you lowered fees again after the approval of the ETF, what went in to making that decision? Do you really see, uh, the fees being a competitive advantage for you as you move forward? I think fees are always important to think about, not because they're important to the asset manager, but because they're important to the client, right? And we aren't looking at the spot. Bitcoin ETF is kind of an asset gathering opportunity. We're looking at it as an investment opportunity. And so we want our investors, particularly those who reward us with their trust in coming early into the fund to get the full benefit of that. And we decided that we're in this for the long haul. We have already multi coin portfolios that we're trading in separately managed accounts. We have the first ever uh us public mutual fund on Blockchain. We, we have many products that we're looking to push and the Bitcoin is a exciting new one and we want our investors to get 100% of the benefit of that out of the gate. So we really decided to suspending the fees until we got to 10 billion A. Um Or until we got to the first through the first six months was the way to really reward those who went on this journey with us. You just mentioned a few different types of digital asset products. Um Are you seeing new clients come to Franklin Templeton for these offerings or are your existing clients? Um you know, are they excited about these products or is there kind of a an educational gap that the firm is trying to fill for them? Well, we have a whole range, right? So there's been clients that have been on this digital asset journey with us from day one. You know, we run our own nodes, we're on five different public blockchains. We're really working um across many of the crypto natives and with many of the crypto natives in the space and there's been a crypto native audience that's been investing with us for many years now. Uh Then there's been a set of investors who are investing with our venture capital fund who are inventing investing uh through some of our separately managed accounts. Um But it's the newest audience that we're excited to be accessing, which is the more everyday investor that hasn't had this opportunity or, you know, the real technical know how to get into the space. So I think you're finding different audiences have different levels of excitement and it's this newest audience that really has been probably watching but not really feeling comfortable getting into digital assets uh that we think are the most excited about this opportunity. I want to talk about that new audience and come back to the Twitter. Uh There's been some buzz around Solana. I know Franklin Templeton has been tweeting about different ecosystems, different layer ones, Ethereum and Solana being two of them in the last week. Does that mean that investors can expect products that might give them exposure to these two assets or are you maybe thinking about a Solana ETF in the future? Well, we, we have our own investment research team that does research on individual coins and, and certainly both Ethereum and Salana are coins where we co we have coverage, we have our own price forecasts and targets. Uh We talk with our investors about what our research is showing us. Uh And so it feels natural that over time our ETF uh ecosystem will expand. Uh but I can't comment on any specific timing on any of that. But you know, this, it makes sense to think about this as a portfolio of ETF S and opportunities, not just a single Bitcoin portfolio. OK, Sandy, I have to ask you the last time you and I spoke was at consensus 2023 and we're talking about music and culture as digital assets that folks could invest in any progress there uh from the firm's perspective or has the focus really been on getting this ETF off the ground? Well, we have different teams working uh on different initiatives within the group and I could say that we're starting to make some very interesting partnership decisions uh that will hopefully allow us to have some progress on these cultural assets. And this idea that you can own a growing set of assets by using the tokenization wrapper uh and embedding the utilization uh rights and the benefits and the rewards. Uh And we're starting to experiment this with this even within our own organization uh for our conferences. Now that our digital asset team helps to support we're issuing NFTS for those conferences and those NFTS are giving access to the research, uh the proprietary research that we're publishing. So that's our first step on this journey in starting to bring smart contracts into our ecosystem. And we continue to expect that to evolve and grow over time. Our audience might not have been a consensus 2023 last year. So just explain to us a little bit about how Franklin Templeton is thinking about music specifically as a, as a digital asset, as an investable asset for uh investors who are working with your firm. Yeah, I mean, music is a fantastic example, Jen, because when you think about it, you know, royalties are a wonderful cash income stream, right? You know that the songs are gonna be played. Uh you know that the artist has a body of work that keeps their uh fans interested. And it it's a great way to add an income stream to a portfolio, but it's very hard to think about administering a re a royalty pool across millions of investors, right? It's just operationally too difficult to do uh in today's world. But once you start moving into the world of smart contracts, and you start to be able uh to really programmatically split up that pool of royalties into small small fractional shares and have that automatically administered by the algorithms. All of a sudden those royalty pools become amazing sources of potential return. And so this is something we want to unlock for our clients. We think that music are digital, um you know, collectibles. These are all things that people have always put money into for investment purposes, but they haven't been able to wrap them into a portfolio. Uh and therefore you're not getting the risk benefit, the diversification benefit. And we think that this is really going to change in the next few years and we really want to be at the forefront of that. OK. And Sandy, just before we wrap, we've been talking to all the asset managers, your peers who have been approved for a spot. Bitcoin ETF many of them come from the traditional finance world if you were to look forward, uh paint a picture for me, what does the future look like with traditional finance firms, interacting with crypto and vice versa? That's been the most uh I think enjoyable and exciting part of what's been happening in the last few months, Jen is that I think we're finally starting to see the two sides come together, right? The innovation, the creativity, the willingness to push the boundaries and find new business models that the crypto natives represent, um which is just not coming in many instances from the traditional investment side. And yet the comfortableness working with regulators, the understanding of investor protections, uh the thinking about the total portfolio and how that comes together from a risk management and a volatility perspective. That's the real strengths that traditional investment managers bring to the table. So combining uh these innovations with these uh traditional values that have really worked over decades. I mean, Franklin Templeton is 76 years old. Um That's what's so exciting to me. That's really what opens up the potential of the future and it's all to the benefit of our investors. And that's what, you know, all of us in this industry are the most focused on and we're the most excited about Sandy. It's been such a pleasure chatting to you. Thanks so much for joining the show. Thank you so much for having me. That was head of strategy for Franklin Templeton's Digital Asset unit. Sandy K. That's a wrap for first mover. We hope you have a Happy Happy Friday and we'll see you again on Monday morning. Thank you so much for watching this week and thank you to our guests today, Robbie Michnik and Sandy call as a note, interviews are sometimes edited on first mover for clarity and consistency. We hope you have a great weekend and we'll see you next week."

        "title": "Fidelity Investments Launches Spot Bitcoin ETP - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Fidelity Investments joined several different firms in receiving approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) from the SEC this week. The approval has been years in the making and is a milestone decision from the SEC. The launch augurs a new era for crypto accessibility for investors. Fidelity Investments\u2019 FBTC, the Fidelity\u00ae Wise Origin\u00ae Bitcoin fund, stands out as one of the first available options. The firm was one of the first to file a spot bitcoin application in 2021.\n\nSee more: How Fidelity Investments\u2019 Factor ETFs Seek to Outperform Peers\n\nThe spot bitcoin ETP looks to track the performance of bitcoin. Financial advisors and individual investors alike can find the strategy on Fidelity\u2019s various online platforms, priced at 25 basis points. The fee will not apply until August 1, 2024, which sets it apart from some of its rivals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve long believed a spot-priced exchange traded product would be an efficient way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin,\u201d said Cynthia Lo Bessette, Head of Digital Asset Management at Fidelity Investments.\n\n\u201cWith more than a decade of engagement and experience honing our expertise in the digital assets space and building an institutional-grade custody platform, Fidelity delivers a deep understanding of the digital assets ecosystem. It is in a unique position as a long-term leader in the financial services and the emerging crypto landscape,\u201d added Lo Bessette.\u201d\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETP FBTC\u2019s Approach\n\nThe strategy appears on the Cboe BZX Exchange, with a goal of tracking the performance of bitcoin as measured by the performance of the Fidelity Bitcoin Reference Rate, per its prospectus. The ETP\u2019s index uses bitcoin price feeds from eligible bitcoin spot markets and a volume-weighted median price methodology calculated every 15 seconds.\n\nThe new era in bitcoin investing presents a notable opportunity for investors who\u2019ve wanted easier access to the cryptocurrency. For those investors looking to add exposure, the Fidelity\u00ae Wise Origin\u00ae Bitcoin Fund might be one option to consider.\n\nFor more news, information, and strategy, visit the ETF Investing Channel.\n\nDisclosure Information\n\nThis product is for investors with a high risk tolerance. It invests in a single asset, bitcoin, which is highly volatile and can become illiquid at any time.\n\nBitcoin is created, issued, transmitted, and stored according to protocols run by computers in the Bitcoin network. It is possible the Bitcoin protocol has undiscovered flaws that could result in the loss of some or all assets held by the Fund. There may also be network-scale attacks against the Bitcoin protocol, which result in the loss of some or all of assets held by the Fund. Advancements in quantum computing could break Bitcoin\u2019s cryptographic rules. The Fund makes no guarantees about the reliability of the cryptography used to create, issue, or transmit Bitcoin held by the Fund. Bitcoin exchanges may suffer from operational issues, such as delayed execution, that could have an adverse effect on the Fund. Digital asset exchanges have been closed due to fraud, failure or security breaches. Any of the Fund\u2019s assets that reside on an exchange that shuts down or suffers a breach may be lost.\n\nFBTC is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the \u201cCEA\u201d). As a result, shareholders of FBTC do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.\n\nDigital assets are highly volatile, and their market movements are very difficult to predict. Various market forces may impact their value. That includes but is not limited to supply and demand, investors\u2019 faith and their willingness to purchase it using traditional currencies, investors\u2019 expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, interest rates, currency exchange rates, an evolving legislative and regulatory environment in the U.S. and abroad, and other economic trends. Investors also face other risks, including significant and negative price swings, flash crashes, and fraud and cyber- security risks.

        "content": "After receiving dozens of applications, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally gave the green light to 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Jan. 10. The decision is expected to bring new hype and investors into Bitcoin because it allows for a new, equity-based form of investment into the cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile much of the discussion around the benefits of Bitcoin ETFs has been focused on firms sponsoring them and new investors, one party has been left out of the discussion.\n\nThe custodian of the ETFs also plays a major role in making them available to the everyday investor. Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) houses the Bitcoin for 10 out of the 13 spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it ?\n\nThe last-standing top crypto exchange without a major security breach offers what now?\n\nAn ETF works by a sponsoring firm collecting a pool of assets and dividing them into shares that can be sold to investors. Most of the time, the sponsoring firm can hold the assets itself. For instance, the most popular ETF \u2014 SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NASDAQ) SPY \u2014 is a collection of all the stocks in the S&P 500. Sponsoring firm State Street Global Advisors holds the individual stocks.\n\nRegulations make this more difficult for sponsoring companies In the case of Bitcoin ETFs. Because of this, the companies must look elsewhere for a place to house Bitcoin, which they can then package into shares and deliver to investors.\n\nThe logical choice for most of the spot Bitcoin ETFs was Coinbase. As the largest crypto trading platform in the world, the ETF sponsors are confident that they can trust Coinbase with the role of custodian.\n\nCoinbase is known for its safety and security for investors as well as low transaction fees. Cybersecurity and the history of safety are the most important issues for the ETFs. Since the beginning of crypto, hacks have been commonplace. However, Coinbase's security measures use machine learning, two-factor authentication and a vault system to ensure that users' investments are safe. This was particularly attractive for ETFs looking for a custodian.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, whenever the ETFs create new shares, they must buy Bitcoin on Coinbase. Then they can use those Bitcoins to create new shares. Most ETFs are constantly creating new shares, so this could bring sustained institutional activity to the Coinbase platform.\n\nThough its role can be overlooked, Coinbase has a lot to gain from the custodial partnership with the new spot Bitcoin ETFs. Looking to the future, the decision to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs could also pave the way for other spot ETFs, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). If these spot ETFs become a reality, Coinbase could also be the custodian for those.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Why Coinbase (COIN) Is The Biggest Winner From Bitcoin ETF Pending Approvals originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Ether (ETH) could be poised to soar in 2024 on the back of hopes of a spot ETH ETF listing , analysts at Coinbase (COIN) have said. ETH reached its highest price since May 2022 following the approval of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. last week. Several of the firms behind BTC ETFs, such as BlackRock and VanEck, are plotting similar products for ETH, Coinbase said in a weekly newsletter. Aside from ETF hopes, Ethereum's upcoming Dencun upgrade, which aims to improve the mainnet's scalability, could galvanize investor interest in ETH. Institutional crypto firm ETC Group said in its annual report that ether has a bullish outlook given Ethereum's ongoing status as the most dominant blockchain for DeFi and the extra returns users can accrue through staking their coins."

        "title": "How a 27-year-old busted the myth of Bitcoin's anonymity - Ars Technica",
        "content": "JUST OVER A DECADE AGO, Bitcoin appeared to many of its adherents to be the crypto-anarchist holy grail: truly private digital cash for the Internet.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the cryptocurrency\u2019s mysterious and unidentifiable inventor, had stated in an email introducing Bitcoin that \u201cparticipants can be anonymous.\u201d And the Silk Road dark-web drug market seemed like living proof of that potential, enabling the sale of hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal drugs and other contraband for bitcoin while flaunting its impunity from law enforcement.\n\nThis is the story of the revelation in late 2013 that Bitcoin was, in fact, the opposite of untraceable\u2014that its blockchain would actually allow researchers, tech companies, and law enforcement to trace and identify users with even more transparency than the existing financial system. That discovery would upend the world of cybercrime. Bitcoin tracing would, over the next few years, solve the mystery of the theft of a half-billion dollar stash of bitcoins from the world\u2019s first crypto exchange, help enable the biggest dark-web drug market takedown in history, lead to the arrest of hundreds of pedophiles around the world in the bust of the dark web\u2019s largest child sexual abuse video site, and result in the first-, second-, and third-biggest law enforcement monetary seizures in the history of the US Justice Department.\n\nThat 180-degree flip in the world\u2019s understanding of cryptocurrency\u2019s privacy properties, and the epic game of cat-and-mouse that followed, is the larger saga that unfolds in the book Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency, out this week in paperback.\n\nAll of it began when a young, puzzle-loving mathematician named Sarah Meiklejohn started to pull out traceable patterns in the apparent noise of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.. This excerpt from Tracers in the Dark reveals how Meiklejohn came to the discoveries that would launch that new era of crypto criminal justice.\n\nIN EARLY 2013, the shelves of a windowless storage room in a building of the University of California, San Diego, began to fill up with strange, seemingly random objects. A Casio calculator. A pair of alpaca wool socks. A small stack of Magic: The Gathering cards. A Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge for the original Nintendo. A plastic Guy Fawkes mask of the kind popularized by the hacker group Anonymous. An album by the classic rock band Boston on CD.\n\nPeriodically, the door would open, the light would turn on, and a petite, dark-haired graduate student named Sarah Meiklejohn would enter the room and add to the growing piles of miscellaneous artifacts. Then Meiklejohn would walk back out the door, down the hall, up the stairs, and into an office she shared with other graduate students at the UC San Diego computer science department. One wall of the room was almost entirely glass, and it looked out onto the sunbaked vista of Sorrento Valley and the rolling hills beyond. But Meiklejohn\u2019s desk faced away from that expanse. She was wholly focused on the screen of her laptop, where she was quickly becoming one of the strangest, most hyperactive Bitcoin users in the world.\n\nMeiklejohn had personally purchased every one of the dozens of items in the bizarre, growing collection in the UCSD closet using bitcoin, buying each one almost at random from a different vendor who accepted the cryptocurrency. And between those ecommerce orders and trips to the storage room, she was performing practically every other task that a person could carry out with bitcoin, all at once, like a kind of cryptocurrency fanatic having a manic episode.\n\nShe moved money into and out of 10 different bitcoin wallet services and converted dollars to bitcoins on more than two dozen exchanges such as Bitstamp, Mt. Gox, and Coinbase. She wagered those coins on 13 different online gambling services, with names like Satoshi Dice and Bitcoin Kamikaze. She contributed her computer\u2019s mining power to 11 different mining \u201cpools,\u201d groups that collected users\u2019 computing power for mining bitcoins and then paid them a share of the profits. And, again and again, she moved bitcoins into and then out of accounts on the Silk Road, the first-ever dark-web drug market, without ever actually buying any drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn all, Meiklejohn carried out 344 cryptocurrency transactions over the course of a few weeks. With each one, she carefully noted on a spreadsheet the amount, the Bitcoin address she had used for it, and then, after digging up the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain and examining the public record of the payment, the address of the recipient or sender.\n\nMeiklejohn\u2019s hundreds of purchases, bets, and seemingly meaningless movements of money were not, in fact, signs of a psychotic break. Each was a tiny experiment, adding up to a study of a kind that had never been attempted before. After years of claims about Bitcoin\u2019s anonymity\u2014or lack thereof\u2014made by its users, its developers, and even its creator, Meiklejohn was finally putting its privacy properties to the test.\n\nAll of her meticulous, manual transactions were time-consuming and tedious. But Meiklejohn had time to kill: As she was carrying them out and recording the results, her computer was simultaneously running queries on a massive database stored on a server that she and her fellow UCSD researchers had set up, algorithms that sometimes took as long as 12 hours to spit out results. The database represented the entire Bitcoin blockchain, the roughly 16 million transactions that had occurred across the entire Bitcoin economy since its creation four years earlier. For weeks on end, Meiklejohn combed through those transactions while simultaneously tagging the vendors, services, markets, and other recipients on the other end of her hundreds of test transactions.\n\nWhen she had started that process of probing the Bitcoin ecosystem, Meiklejohn had seen her work almost as anthropology: What were people doing with bitcoin? How many of them were saving the cryptocurrency versus spending it? But as her initial findings began to unfold, she had started to develop a much more specific goal, one that ran exactly counter to crypto-anarchists\u2019 idealized notion of bitcoin as the ultimate privacy-preserving currency of the dark web: She aimed to prove, beyond any doubt, that bitcoin transactions could very often be traced. Even when the people involved thought they were anonymous."

        "content": "Before being uplisted to an ETF from a trust, GBTC was one of one of the only ways for stock traders in the U.S. to gain exposure to the price movements of bitcoin without the need to purchase the actual cryptocurrency. That made it the largest regulated bitcoin fund in the world by AUM. The bank had previously estimated that up to $3 billion had been invested in GBTC in the secondary market during 2023 to exploit the trust\u2019s discount to NAV. If this estimate is correct, and given that $1.5 billion has already exited, there could be an additional $1.5 billion to exit the space via profit-taking on GBTC, which will put further pressure on bitcoin prices in the coming weeks. These outflows are also putting pressure on GBTC to lower its fees, the report said, adding that the \u201cGBTC fee at 1.5% still looks too high compared to other spot bitcoin ETFs risking further outflows.\u201d \u201cA lot more capital, perhaps an additional $5 billion-$10 billion, could exit GBTC if it loses its liquidity advantage,\u201d the bank cautioned. As of Friday, GBTC is the most expensive ETF among counterparts, with some charging zero fees for the first six months or until a certain assets under management (AUM) target is reached."

        "content": "While US spot bitcoin ETFs may shrink the premium at which MicroStrategy stock trades relative to BTC, the company\u2019s shares are set to continue offering certain advantages over such funds, some industry watchers say.\n\nSome investors have historically used the shares of business intelligence firm MicroStrategy as a sort of proxy for BTC given the company\u2019s large stack of the asset.\n\nMicroStrategy is the largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin \u2014 with holdings totaling 189,150 BTC, as of Dec. 26.\n\nBut the milestone launch of spot bitcoin ETFs last week gives investors a new access point to more easily gain BTC exposure.\n\nRead more: MicroStrategy stock has advantages over planned spot bitcoin ETFs: Saylor\n\nTD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza said earlier this month he expected US spot bitcoin ETFs to substantially increase the price of bitcoin and compress the premium at which MicroStrategy trades relative to bitcoin \u2014 results set to cause \u201ca material rise in the price of MSTR stock.\u201d\n\nThe premium that MicroStrategy shares trade to bitcoin could fall from roughly 40% to between 15% and 25%, Vitanza added at the time.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s share price was down 18.5% in the last five days, as of market close Thursday. Bitcoin\u2019s price was down at the time about 4.5% over that span.\n\nVitanza and research associate Jonnathan Navarrete wrote in a Jan. 16 research note that while the ETF launches have driven down MicroStrategy\u2018s bitcoin premium, the company shares offer unique benefits.\n\n\u201cChief among these benefits is that shareholders pay no management fee; corporate overhead is borne by the cash flows associated with its operating enterprise software business,\u201d the TD Cowen analysts wrote. \u201cIn fact, even net of its corporate overhead, the company\u2019s free cash flow effectively serves as a \u2018reverse fee\u2019 paid not by shareholders, but to shareholders.\u201d\n\nTD Cowen values MicroStrategy\u2019s operating software business at $1.25 billion, Vitanza and Navarrete note. Q3 revenues from MicroStrategy\u2019s software licenses and subscription services were $45 million and $21 million, respectively.\n\nDan Weiskopf, a co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK), told Blockworks the latest pull-back on MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price was \u201cnatural\u201d given it was up more than two times bitcoin\u2019s price last year.\n\nHe noted that while he believes MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor and his team have been smart about how they manage their capital structure and buy more bitcoin, the availability of spot bitcoin ETFs gives investors more optionality.\n\nRead more: BlackRock beats spot bitcoin ETF rivals in race to $1B assets\n\n\u201cThe question is whether investors in bitcoin through MicroStrategy want to sell and pay [capital gains] to buy an ETF,\u201d Weiskopf said. \u201cCurrently, the valuation on enterprise value seems interesting to us in the short term, assuming 190,000 BTC at the current price and the cheap debt.\u201d\n\nThe company launched a product in October designed to allow organizations to incorporate generative artificial intelligence into their data applications.\n\n\u201cMy question around MicroStrategy is where they go with the software business and whether there is a real AI kicker in the stock,\u201d Weiskopf added.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF Tracker\n\nJeff Ross, founder of Vailshire Capital Management, said during an X space Thursday that he believes bitcoin miners and MicroStrategy are likely to outperform BTC in the event of an upcoming bull market.\n\n\u201cPersonally for my clients, I\u2019ve stuck with bitcoin miners but, more, I\u2019ve stuck with MicroStrategy,\u201d Ross said. \u201cI think [Saylor] does a great job with knowing when his shares are overpriced and distributing more shares to the market and then taking that cash and buying bitcoin. He knows\u2026when to take out debt at low rates in order to buy more bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy indicated in August it had entered into a sales agreement with Cowen and Company, Canaccord Genuity and Berenberg Capital Markets to sell up to $750 million of stock with one or more of those entities. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang said the firm could use the proceeds for \u201cgeneral corporate purposes,\u201d including to buy more bitcoin.\n\nVitanza and Navarrete said in the Jan. 16 research note they ultimately expect any future contraction in the company\u2019s premium over bitcoin to be offset by an increase in BTC\u2019s price.\n\nRead more: To gauge impact of bitcoin spot ETF, analysts look to gold\n\nSegment observers have said they expect bitcoin\u2019s price to increase as greater adoption for spot bitcoin ETFs coincides with the next bitcoin halving.\n\nThey added: \u201cA significant premium will continue to be justified, we believe, given MicroStrategy\u2019s lack of management fee, organic bitcoin accretion\u2026use of intelligent financial leverage and downside protection.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Most of the approved ETFs have fees of between 0.2% and 0.4%.\n\nBut the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF charges a 1.5% fee.\n\nSonnenshein laid out several reasons why it is charging that fee, including the fact it is the largest bitcoin fund, has a 10-year track record of \"operating successfully\" and has a diversified investor base.\n\n\"Investors are weighing heavily things like liquidity and track record and who the actual issuer is behind the product.

And it has really paved the way for a lot of these products coming through,\" Sonnenshein told CNBC in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.\n\nSonnenshein said the reason other ETFs have lower fees is that the products \"don't have a track record\" and the issuers are trying to attract investors with fee incentives.\n\n\"I think from our standpoint, it may at times call into question their long-term commitment to the asset class,\" Sonnenshein said.\n\nThe Grayscale CEO said two to three of the spot Bitcoin ETFs \"will maybe obtain some kind of critical mass\" of assets under management, but that the others may be pulled from the market.\n\n\"I don't ultimately think that the marketplace will have ultimately these 11 spot products we find ourselves having,\" Sonnenshein said."

        "title": "2024 Crypto Crime Trends from Chainalysis - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "2023 was a year of recovery for cryptocurrency, as the industry rebounded from the scandals, blowups, and price declines of 2022. With crypto assets rebounding and market activity growing over the course of 2023, many believe that crypto winter is ending, and a new growth phase may soon be upon us.\n\nBut what did all of that mean for crypto crime? Let\u2019s look at the high-level trends.\n\n2023 saw a significant drop in value received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses, to a total of $24.2 billion. As always, we have to caveat by saying that these figures are lower bound estimates based on inflows to the illicit addresses we\u2019ve identified today. One year from now, these totals will almost certainly be higher, as we identify more illicit addresses and incorporate their historic activity into our estimates. For instance, when we published our Crypto Crime Report last year, we estimated $20.6 billion worth of illicit transaction volume for 2022. One year later, our updated estimate for 2022 is $39.6 billion. Much of that growth came from the identification of previously unknown, highly active addresses hosted by sanctioned services, as well as our addition of transaction volume associated with services in sanctioned jurisdictions to our illicit totals.\n\nAnother key reason the new total is so much higher, besides the identification of new illicit addresses: We\u2019re now counting the $8.7 billion in creditor claims against FTX in our 2022 figures. In last year\u2019s report, we said that we would hold off on including transaction volumes associated with FTX and other firms that collapsed that year under allegedly fraudulent circumstances in our illicit totals until legal processes played out. Since then, a jury has convicted FTX\u2019s former CEO of fraud.\n\nTypically, we only include measurable on-chain activity in our estimates for illicit activity. In the case of FTX, it is impossible to use on-chain data alone to measure the scope of the fraudulent activity, as there\u2019s no way to isolate illegitimate movements of user funds. As such, we believe the $8.7 billion in creditor claims against FTX is the best estimate to include. Given the size and impact of the FTX situation, we are treating it as an exception to our usual on-chain methodology. If courts convict in similar, ongoing cases, we plan to include their activity in our illicit transaction data as well in the future.\n\nAll other totals exclude revenue from non-crypto native crime, such as conventional drug trafficking in which crypto is used as a means of payment. Such transactions are virtually indistinguishable from licit transactions in on-chain data. Of course, law enforcement with off-chain context can still investigate these flows using Chainalysis solutions. In cases where we\u2019re able to confirm such information, we count the transactions as illicit in our data, but there are almost certainly many instances where that isn\u2019t the case, and therefore the numbers wouldn\u2019t be reflected in our totals.\n\nIn addition to the reduction in absolute value of illicit activity, our estimate for the share of all crypto transaction volume associated with illicit activity also fell, to 0.34% from 0.42% in 2022. [1]\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing a shift in the types of assets involved in cryptocurrency-based crime.\n\nThrough 2021, Bitcoin reigned supreme as the cryptocurrency of choice among cybercriminals, likely due to its high liquidity. But that\u2019s changed over the last two years, with stablecoins now accounting for the majority of all illicit transaction volume. This change also comes alongside recent growth in stablecoins\u2019 share of all crypto activity overall, including legitimate activity. However, stablecoin dominance isn\u2019t the case for all forms of cryptocurrency-based crime.\n\nSome forms of illicit cryptocurrency activity, such as darknet market sales and ransomware extortion, still take place predominantly in Bitcoin. [2] Others, like scamming and transactions associated with sanctioned entities, have shifted to stablecoins. Those also happen to be the biggest forms of crypto crime by transaction volume, thereby driving the larger trend. Sanctioned entities, as well as those operating in sanctioned jurisdictions or involved with terrorism financing, also have a greater incentive to use stablecoins, as they may face more challenges accessing the U.S. dollar through traditional means, but still want to benefit from the stability it provides. However, stablecoin issuers can freeze funds when they become aware of their illicit use, as Tether recently did with addresses linked to terrorism and warfare in Israel and Ukraine.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll look at three key trends that defined crypto crime in 2023 and will be important to watch moving forward.\n\nScamming and Stolen Funds down big\n\nCrypto scamming and hacking revenue both fell significantly in 2023, with total illicit revenue for each down 29.2% and 54.3% respectively.\n\nAs we discuss later in our scams section, many crypto scammers have now adopted romance scam tactics, targeting individuals and building relationships with them in order to pitch them on fraudulent investing opportunities, rather than advertising them far and wide, which often makes them more difficult to uncover. Although the FBI has published data showing that reports of crypto investment scams in the U.S. has been increasing year over year through 2022, our on-chain metrics suggest scamming revenues globally have been trending down since 2021. We believe this aligns with the long-standing trend that scamming is most successful when markets are up, exuberance is high, and people feel like they are missing out on an opportunity to get rich quickly. Of course, the impact of romance scams on individual victims is devastating and should not be understated. And while increased reporting \u2013 at least in the U.S. \u2013 is a good sign, we still believe insights into romance scams in particular suffer from underreporting. We hypothesize that the true damage of scamming is greater than what reporting to the FBI and our on-chain metrics show, but overall, scamming is down, given broader market dynamics.\n\nCrypto hacking, on the other hand, is much more difficult for criminals to hide, as industry observers can quickly spot the unusual outflows from a given service or protocol when a hack occurs. As we\u2019ll discuss later, the decline in stolen funds is driven largely by a sharp dropoff in DeFi hacking. That dropoff could represent the reversal of a disturbing, long-term trend, and may signify that DeFi protocols are improving their security practices. That said, stolen funds metrics are heavily outlier-driven, and one large hack could again shift the trend.\n\nRansomware and darknet market activity on the rise\n\nRansomware and darknet markets, on the other hand, are two of the most prominent forms of crypto crime that saw revenues rise in 2023, in contrast with overall trends. The growth of ransomware revenue is disappointing following the sharp declines we covered last year, and suggests that perhaps ransomware attackers have adjusted to organizations\u2019 cybersecurity improvements, a trend we first reported earlier this year.\n\nSimilarly, this year\u2019s growth in darknet market revenue also comes after a 2022 decline in revenue. That decline was driven largely by the shutdown of Hydra, which was once the world\u2019s most dominant market by far, capturing over 90% of all darknet market revenue at its peak. While no single market has yet emerged to take its place, the sector as a whole is rebounding, with total revenue climbing back towards its 2021 highs.\n\nTransactions with sanctioned entities drive the vast majority of illicit activity\n\nPerhaps the most obvious trend that emerges when looking at illicit transaction volume is the prominence of sanctions-related transactions. Sanctioned entities and jurisdictions together accounted for a combined $14.9 billion worth of transaction volume in 2023, which represents 61.5% of all illicit transaction volume we measured on the year. Most of this total is driven by cryptocurrency services that were sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), or are located in sanctioned jurisdictions, and can continue to operate because they\u2019re in jurisdictions where U.S. sanctions are not enforced.\n\nWhile those services can and have been used for nefarious purposes, it also means that some of that $14.9 billion in sanctions-related transaction volume includes activity from average crypto users who happen to reside in those jurisdictions. For example, Russia-based exchange Garantex, which was sanctioned by OFAC and OFSI in the U.K. for its facilitation of money laundering on behalf of ransomware attackers and other cybercriminals, was one of the biggest drivers of transaction volume associated with sanctioned entities in 2023. Garantex continues to operate because Russia does not enforce U.S. sanctions. So, does that mean all of Garantex\u2019s transaction volume is associated with ransomware and money laundering? No. Nevertheless, exposure to Garantex introduces serious sanctions risk for crypto platforms subject to U.S. or U.K. jurisdiction, which means those platforms must remain ever-more vigilant and screen for exposure to Garantex in order to be compliant.\n\nMore crypto crime insights to come\n\nStay on the lookout for more research into cryptocurrency-based crime, as we continue to roll out insights on ransomware, hacking, crypto money laundering, and more.

        "content": "There is a large chunk of the recently converted GBTC spot bitcoin ETF that will be forcibly sold, if it hasn't been already. Why it matters: GBTC is one of 10 spot bitcoin exchange traded funds vying for new dollars since receiving the milestone nod from the SEC to list last week.\n\nCatch up fast: The bankruptcy estate of collapsed crypto exchange FTX was approved in late November to sell more than 22 million units of Grayscale Investment's GBTC.\n\nGrayscale launched the former trust product in 2013, long before the SEC was pressed into approving ETFs based on bitcoin's spot price.\n\nAs of January 10, the fund had more than $28 billion of assets under management.\n\nBy the numbers: Assuming the FTX estate sold all of its GBTC post-conversion, say at $40.69 per share, it would've gotten back roughly $907 million (it was valued at $597 million in October).\n\nBetween the lines: Even if only some of it was sold, it would account for a lot of the GBTC selling activity seen lately.\n\nOf note: Axios called FTX's lawyers, the brokerage account that holds the assets, and the folks tapped to handle the sale to check if that was happening. None have responded for comment.\n\nGo deeper: Bitcoin ETFs have picked up billions, but too early to crown a winner"

        "title": "Spot bitcoin investment funds likely to stoke miners' massive energy use - Marketplace",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, so for the first time, people can invest in funds that include bitcoin with no crypto wallet required. A \u201cspot\u201d fund invests in the asset directly, as opposed to making bets on futures contracts.\n\nDemand for the original cryptocurrency is only expected to grow, and bitcoin mining operators are in position to satisfy it. Two years ago, Marketplace\u2019s Lily Jamali visited one in New York state. Stacks of computers burned through tons of power to generate new bitcoins, she reported.\n\nBen Hertz-Shargel of the consultancy Wood Mackenzie told Lily that the SEC\u2019s move will likely expand the miners\u2019 prodigious energy consumption. Texas is a hub for bitcoin mining, and among other effects, the increase could stress the state\u2019s already vulnerable power grid.\n\nThe following is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nBen Hertz-Shargel: It will send a long-term price signal to these miners to redouble their efforts and to build newer and bigger facilities. And Texas, like certain other states, is really in the crosshairs of multiple types of load growth, or energy demand growth, where they\u2019re dealing with not only growth from conventional data centers and crypto mines, but [electric vehicle] charging depots and manufacturing facilities. And so it\u2019s a challenge to deal with all of this increase in demand. Miners have already caused $1.8 billion per year in increased costs for consumers in Texas, and that was before these ETFs were approved. And this is going to really lock that in and potentially drive it up to extreme degrees.\n\nLily Jamali: So it\u2019s clear that demand for bitcoin, if anybody thought that was going away, that\u2019s not happening, at least not in the short term. I also visited a bitcoin mining facility in upstate New York in late 2021, early 2022. I was struck by something you wrote about, saying that in 2022, bitcoin mining consumed 60% as much power as it does today. Why does it cost so much more to generate a single bitcoin now?\n\nHertz-Shargel: Well, ultimately, demand for bitcoin has gone up. And there\u2019s an arms race that happens every day, where bitcoin miners who are operating ever larger data centers capture ever bigger pieces of the pie in terms of the revenue that bitcoin mining generates. And so that arms race has led to ever bigger facilities and more countries and greater investments. And so, yeah, the really scary statistic is that in 2022, mining consumed 20% as much electricity as global centralized data computing and data transmission put together. And the reason that is a staggering statistic is those two latter types of energy demand, data computing and data transmission, are really the fruits of the internet, the cloud and now the sort of budding [artificial intelligence] industrial revolution put together. So the question is, you have to evaluate: Is the value that bitcoin provides, essentially being a store of value like gold, worth one-fifth as much of the value that all of those other forms of energy demand are providing?\n\nJamali: Texas is the only state in the country, we should mention, with its own grid. Have I got that right?\n\nHertz-Shargel: Other states have their own grid operator. But yes, Texas is self-contained in an electrical way that no other state is.\n\nJamali: Yeah, and so it\u2019s especially vulnerable. And I asked that because we\u2019re approaching the third anniversary of the winter storm that left a lot of people without power. It ended up killing 250 people. And just this week, the state went through a winter freeze. So help us understand how much pressure in moments like this do bitcoin miners place on the grid?\n\nHertz-Shargel: I think there is a miners\u2019 claim, and I think there is popular belief, that they stop operating when the grid is stressed, when energy prices are high. In reality, a lot of miners, we\u2019ve seen firsthand, continue to operate even in these kind of stressed conditions when prices are really high. This not only raises the price in an extreme way for consumers after the fact, but it does risk the grid operator getting closer and closer to that point where it needs to consider brownouts. So, the reality is these miners are stretching the grid basically 24/7. And in some cases, they do turn off in extreme cases, but not all of them do. And so it just pushes the grid closer to that point you don\u2019t want to be where you\u2019re running the risk of having to turn the lights out on people.\n\nJamali: And I know as of not that long ago, bitcoin miners in Texas, specifically, were getting paid, or compensated, if they put power back on the grid during these extreme weather events. Is that still the case?\n\nHertz-Shargel: It is still the case. And what that does is it shifts the cost of the year\u2019s grid investment, which is only growing more significant every year, back on to other customers. And I think it\u2019s also worth pointing out that the big tech companies are the largest buyers of clean energy in the United States. Whereas bitcoin miners, what they do is they have begun to site their facilities near renewable facilities like a wind farm or solar farm. But all that does is, you\u2019re still drawing the same unit of power that some other customer would have benefited from from that facility. They\u2019re not meaningfully offsetting their demand.\n\nJamali: This is interesting because this is an argument that the bitcoin miners have made \u2014 the fact that they now are starting to set up shop next to those existing renewables projects. They say, \u201cLook, we\u2019re helping. We\u2019re not making things worse.\u201d\n\nHertz-Shargel: That\u2019s right. But it\u2019s very intuitive to understand that if you park a facility right next to, let\u2019s say, a solar farm and start consuming the electrons from that facility, those electrons would have gone to some other customer in Texas. So all you\u2019re doing as the one who happens to consume them, at the end of the day overall demand on the grid goes up. And that means that the grid operator needs to dispatch ever more costly and carbon-intensive generators to meet that increased demand that you caused. And so there is no sustainability benefit, which is very much unlike what the big tech companies are doing by actually causing new renewable facilities to be built. So those facilities meaningfully do offset the emissions associated with their, their demand.\n\nJamali: Are there any indications that regulation might help cap some of this activity?\n\nHertz-Shargel: Well, I mean, I think what we\u2019ve seen around the country is that most states are more concerned to protect bitcoin mining rather than constrain it. They usually introduce legislation that prevents a state from \u201cdiscriminating\u201d against the type of data center or facility based on its purpose. I do think Texas, there has been some backlash because of the awareness [that] these are massive energy loads that you can compare them to the size of cities or other sort of extraordinary types of demand sources. And so I do think that there was this notion that they want to limit how much they\u2019re willing to pay them to curtail. I do think it\u2019s important to identify when they say they\u2019re putting power back on the grid, what that means is they have usually contracted for power from a generator, and they simply choose to withhold consuming that power, and they allow their provider to liquidate the power to sell it to the grid. So they\u2019re just making available something that would have been available anyway if they didn\u2019t exist.\n\nMore on this\n\nHere\u2019s Lily\u2019s story from her visit to that bitcoin mining operation she mentioned. Her reporting focused on what locals in Massena, New York, thought about the arrival of bitcoin mining in their struggling regional economy. One resident called crypto \u201ctechno-wizard bullshit.\u201d\n\nA few months into 2022, the state of New York placed a partial moratorium on what\u2019s known as proof of work mining, citing the environmental impacts. Before that, Plattsburgh, New York, became the first municipality in the country to ban the practice after undergoing what former Mayor Colin Read called a \u201ccrypto mining arms race\u201d in the MIT Technology Review. Read happens to be an economics professor and has written a book, \u201cThe Bitcoin Dilemma,\u201d about the financial and environmental costs of this activity.\n\nSomething else Ben Hertz-Shargel mentioned in our interview is that New York is an exception. Many states are eager for the business. Here\u2019s a tracker that looks at the amount of energy consumed by specific bitcoin mining companies in Texas, where the growth has been explosive."

        "content": "Welcome back to \" Ask an Advisor ,\" the advice column where real financial professionals answer questions from real people. The topic can be anything in the world of finance, from retirement to taxes to wealth management \u2014 or even advice on advising.\n\nLast week, after years of resistance, the SEC approved the spot bitcoin ETF . Specifically, it approved 11 versions of the new exchange-traded fund, offered by brands including Grayscale, Fidelity and iShares.\n\nWhat makes this product unusual is what's inside it: actual bitcoin. Unlike derivatives-based bitcoin ETFs, which are based on bitcoin futures contracts, the spot bitcoin ETF's underlying asset is bitcoin itself. This means more direct tracking of the cryptocurrency's price, but also more exposure to its volatility.\n\nThough the SEC approved the new funds, its decision was far from a full-throated endorsement. The commission has long been skeptical of the spot bitcoin ETF, and in fact rejected more than 20 applications for this kind of product from 2018 to 2023. It relented only after the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. ruled against one of those decisions.\n\nSo when SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced the SEC's final decision, he did so with obvious reluctance.\n\n\"While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP [exchange-traded product] shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin,\" Gensler wrote. \"Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\"\n\nREAD MORE: What financial advisors need to know about SEC-approved spot bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe chairman went on to describe bitcoin as a \"speculative, volatile asset that's also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion and terrorist financing.\"\n\nSo to put it mildly, there are some asterisks on this approval. And yet, it's here: The spot bitcoin ETF is now available to investors. Can it be a good investment? Will financial advisors recommend it to clients? To find out, I asked the advisors themselves. Here's what I wrote:\n\nDear advisors,\n\nLast week, after years of resistance, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs. In approving the ETFs, Chair Gary Gensler pointedly did not endorse bitcoin in general, and cautioned investors once again about the risks of crypto.\n\nSo my question is, is a spot bitcoin ETF safer than bitcoin itself? Would you recommend any of these products to clients? If so, to whom? What role could these ETFs play in a portfolio \u2014 or do you prefer to stay away from them all together?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nWary in Washington Heights\n\nAnd here's what advisors wrote back:"

        "title": "'Vanguard Is Not Your Mother': Ric Edelman Excoriates Bitcoin ETF Holdout - ThinkAdvisor",
        "content": "What You Need to Know Vanguard shouldn't tell customers they can't invest in bitcoin ETFs, Edelman said.\n\nThe fund giant will eventually offer the ETFs, the crypto advocate predicted.\n\nGrayscale's higher fee is rude to those who own it, he said.\n\nDigital Assets Council of Financial Professionals founder Ric Edelman, while celebrating the recent U.S. regulatory green light for 11 spot bitcoin ETFs, blasted fund giant Vanguard Group and scolded crypto asset manager Grayscale over their approaches to the new securities.\n\nIn his podcast, The Truth About Your Future, Edelman scorched Vanguard this week for its \u201cobnoxious\u201d and \u201cpatriarchal\u201d decision to bar clients from purchasing crypto assets, including the new bitcoin ETFs, on its platform, and urged a boycott.\n\nAnd while crediting Grayscale for its prominent role in making spot bitcoin ETFs a reality, he knocked the firm for the 1.5% annual fee on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), which the firm converted from a closed-end fund structure to a spot bitcoin ETF when the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the new funds last week.\n\nThe crypto advocate predicted Vanguard will eventually offer the bitcoin ETFs, which the asset manager has said don\u2019t align with its views on well-balanced, long-term portfolios.\n\n\u2018Vanguard Is Not Your Mother\u2019\n\n\u201cThat is beyond ridiculous. Vanguard offers nearly 400 mutual funds and ETFs. It offers thousands more that are sponsored by other fund companies. On Vanguard\u2019s platform, you can buy dozens of mutual funds and ETFs that Vanguard itself says are of the highest risk of all investments \u2014 commodities funds, emerging markets funds, gold funds,\u201d he said, according to the Tuesday podcast\u2019s transcript.\n\n\u201cApparently, Vanguard doesn\u2019t know that the SEC has ruled that bitcoin is a commodity. So if Vanguard offers other commodities ETFs, why not this commodity ETF? And apparently Vanguard doesn\u2019t really understand what a well-balanced long-term portfolio really is. How can you build a well-balanced portfolio if you\u2019re excluding some assets that help you balance out the risks of the portfolio?\u201d Edelman asked.\n\n\u201cVanguard obviously needs a course in modern portfolio theory, the Nobel Prize-winning investment management methodology that virtually every financial advisor adheres to. When you add a risky asset to a diversified portfolio, you actually lower the risk of the overall portfolio while increasing returns. Doesn\u2019t Vanguard know this?\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cHow can Vanguard say that bitcoin isn\u2019t a solid long-term investment? Would Vanguard have preferred that you buy Kodak, which was a 150-year-old company but then went bankrupt, or Blockbuster Video that got wiped out by Netflix? How can Vanguard claim that it knows which investments are the right ones for the long term?\u201d Edelman asked.\n\nHe seemed to accuse the company of helicopter parenting.\n\n\u201cWho the hell is Vanguard to make that decision for you in the first place anyway? Vanguard is not your mother. They don\u2019t get to tell you what to do. Their job is to make available all the investments that are permitted by the SEC. \u2026 It\u2019s for Vanguard to put them on their platform and then let the investor and the investment advisor decide, just like they decide about all of the other thousands of funds that are on Vanguard\u2019s platform.\u201d\n\nInvestors aren\u2019t hiring Vanguard to tell them what they can and can\u2019t do, Edelman continued.\n\n\u201cThis is an obnoxious, arrogant and highly inappropriate patriarchal decision by Vanguard, and it\u2019s going to cost them a lot of customers and a lot of business. Already, social media is filled with investors who are complaining about this, and they\u2019re busy transferring their accounts from Vanguard to Schwab, where you can buy all 11 of these spot bitcoin ETFs on Schwab.com,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoycott Vanguard, transfer your assets tax-free and fee-free to someone else. That will give you the access to the bitcoin ETFs that you want. Schwab is a good choice. It\u2019s not the only choice, it\u2019s a good one. And lots of financial advisors are also ready to help you, but not those who custody at Vanguard,\u201d Edelman said.\n\nWells Fargo, Merrill Lynch, UBS and Citi are letting their investors trade the new bitcoin ETFs, he added, calling Vanguard \u201ccrazy\u201d and out of step with the financial services industry.\n\nHe predicted Vanguard will change course.\n\n\u201cFive years from now, they will have crypto ETFs and they will allow their customers to buy all the ETF products. But they\u2019re going to be very late to the party. And their customers who sit with them and wait are going to miss out on the massive opportunities they currently have to reduce overall portfolio risks and enhance overall portfolio returns,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cShame on Vanguard.\u201d\n\nNo Reason to Pay Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Fee\n\nAs for Grayscale, Edelman praised its work to win regulatory approval for spot bitcoin ETFs but criticzed its comparatively high fee and the effect on longtime holders.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s popular closed-end trust, once one of the few vehicles for bitcoin exposure other than directly buying the digital coins, became the largest spot bitcoin ETF, with $26 billon in assets under management, upon conversion. It lowered its fee from 2% to 1.5%, a rate significantly higher than competitors.\n\n\u201cWe are all deeply grateful to Grayscale for its leadership. It was their lawsuit against the SEC that is directly responsible for the SEC finally granting approval of these bitcoin ETFs, and the SEC didn\u2019t just say yes to GBTC. \u2026 The SEC said yes to 11 of these ETFs,\u201d Edelman said.\n\n\u201cThis is wonderful because it creates market competition that helps to lower the prices for everybody. But it also creates a bit of work for you as an advisor or as an investor, because now you\u2019ve got to evaluate all 11 of them, and you\u2019ve got to decide which ones you want to use. So while I say thanks to Grayscale for making all this happen \u2026 I have to say to Grayscale your GBTC, your bitcoin ETF sucks.\u201d\n\nFor years, Grayscale was the only game in town, Edelman said, noting he\u2019s owned it a long time and has \u201cmade a ton of money on it.\u201d He didn\u2019t mind the fee because he expected big profits and there wasn\u2019t much choice.\n\n\u201cBut now GBTC is an ETF among 11 ETFs, and there\u2019s simply no reason to pay 1.5% per year. Not one,\u201d he said.\n\nFranklin Templeton, Bitwise, Fidelity, Invesco and others are charging zero for six months to a year, and even after that time period, the ETFs are \u201cfree,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir fee will be a fraction of GBTC\u2019s fee. Franklin Templeton is just 0.19%, Bitwise is 0.2%. Blackrock and Fidelity are 0.25%,\u201d he said.\n\nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein \u201cknows that the overwhelming majority of people who own GBTC are going to keep it,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cThey\u2019re either too dumb to know that they\u2019re paying an outrageous fee, or they\u2019re too lazy to do anything about it, or they don\u2019t want to sell it and incur the taxes on their profits. He\u2019s right. I bet that he\u2019ll keep almost all the AUM in that fund. He might not attract much more in new assets.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF rush spells uncertain future for Grayscale - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT\u2019s Cryptofinance newsletter. Today we\u2019re taking a look at what comes next for Grayscale\u2019s new bitcoin ETF.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following my ETF coverage this week you\u2019ll know the collective launch of the US\u2019s newly approved league of bitcoin exchange traded funds has been broadly underwhelming.\n\nAccording to data from CoinShares, net flows into the 11 funds totalled less than $900mn in the first three days of trading, although that figure ticked above $1bn by close of business on Thursday.\n\nQuestions linger for this new world. For a start, bitcoin\u2019s price has fallen 9.2 per cent since the ETFs got the green light from the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 hardly the boost some had hoped for.\n\nStill, it is early days. Right now, one of the biggest topics is the future of the Grayscale bitcoin ETF. Unlike the others, Grayscale has been running a bitcoin trust for several years: a closed end fund where investors could not retrieve their coins, but only sell shares in the trust over-the-counter, and often at a large discount to the price of bitcoin.\n\nIt built up more than $28bn in assets under management (AuM) before Grayscale was allowed to convert the trust to an ETF, alongside the launch of 10 new competitors. The company scored a landmark legal victory over the SEC in August, which paved the way for the regulator\u2019s eventual reversal of a decade-long policy of rejecting spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAccording to data from crypto investment group CoinShares, $2.2bn has flowed out of Grayscale\u2019s fund since it started trading last week as of close of business on Thursday.\n\nTo be fair, the scale of Grayscale\u2019s holdings can lose plenty of assets before it feels competitors snapping at its heels. Still, I asked Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale\u2019s chief executive, what those outflows mean for his new fund. He was unfazed, choosing instead to emphasise Grayscale\u2019s longstanding record in a market where BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark, Bitwise and the rest are newcomers.\n\n\u201c[For many investors] it not only resonates that they\u2019re invested in a fund that is large, liquid and has a track record, but that it is also being provided to them by a company that is a specialist\u2026a lot of these other asset managers are really getting to crypto for the first time,\u201d he said, adding \u201cto be clear, they\u2019re coming to market to compete with us\u201d.\n\nHe played up Grayscale\u2019s role in forging a path for bitcoin investment that others had now followed, adding that eventually he expects a \u201crising tide will lift all boats\u201d.\n\nYet no matter how brave a face Sonnenshein puts on, the fact remains Grayscale\u2019s new ETF has haemorrhaged well over $2bn in assets in just one week of trading. In contrast, BlackRock \u2014 the largest asset manager in the world \u2014 has pulled in $1.2bn since launch.\n\nBidding to change its investment trust to an ETF was always a risky game for Grayscale, given the rush of new competition would be likely to spark a price war.\n\n\u201cWe always knew that pushing for an ETF could damage [Grayscale\u2019s] business strategy,\u201d said CoinShares\u2019 head of research James Butterfill. \u201cUltimately, they\u2019ve been sitting on a closed end fund and charging expensive fees. Moving to an ETF liberalises the market.\u201d\n\nGrayscale is sticking with its fee plan for now, even though it lowered its annual management charge to a 1.5 per cent fee, from 2 per cent, in the run-up to launch.\n\nBlackRock, for example, charges just 0.12 per cent for the present, although that will rise to 0.25 per cent in the next year or if it attracts $5bn in AuM.\n\n\u201cThere is no current discussion about [further reducing fees],\u201d Sonnenshein added. \u201cWe made a commitment to investors to lower fees and we honoured that commitment.\u201d\n\nHe will be hoping that commitment \u2014 alongside Grayscale\u2019s much-trumpeted record \u2014 will be enough to persuade the rest of his investors to hang around for longer.\n\nSome analysts are less optimistic.\n\n\u201cCompetition on fees is causing investors to exit Grayscale and shift to alternative ETF products,\u201d said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive at investment adviser Lumida Wealth Management.\n\nBut if the first week of trading is anything to go by, my analysis last September is proving to be right so far: Grayscale opened the door to Wall Street with its SEC victory, and now bigger names are marching in and eating Sonnenshein\u2019s dinner.\n\n\u201cThey started off as this 800lb gorilla, but now they\u2019re facing stiff competition,\u201d said Jim Angel, professor at Georgetown University.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re playing a wait and see game but it\u2019s a difficult position to be in, if they keep fees too high their assets will fly out the door.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on Grayscale\u2019s future in the ETF sector? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nWeekly highlights:\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of bitcoin ETFs, make sure you don\u2019t miss last weekend\u2019s piece where Nikou Asgari and I looked at why bitcoin\u2019s Wall Street takeover has frustrated the sector\u2019s true believers. Those who bought into Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original message hoped bitcoin would champion a libertarian alternative to mainstream finance, but instead, the newly approved ETF class of 2024 cements the coin as merely a vehicle for speculation.\n\nJudge Jed Rakoff this week pushed the trial of Do Kwon \u2014 the mind behind the failed TerraUSD stablecoin that kickstarted crypto\u2019s 2022 market crisis \u2014 to March 25 2024. The disgraced crypto kingpin was charged by US prosecutors with eight criminal counts including securities, commodities and wire fraud after his arrest in Montenegro last year, and is awaiting an anticipated extradition to the US.\n\nSoundbite of the week: Scams supercharged by crypto\n\nMoney laundering via black market casinos of south-east Asia is hardly new. But a UN report this week shed a new angle on it.\n\nCrypto, and the stablecoin Tether in particular, has helped give the underground sector a new lease of life, says Jeremy Douglas, a regional representative of the UN\u2019s Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\n\u201cOrganised crime has effectively created a parallel banking system using new technologies, and the proliferation of loosely or entirely unregulated online casinos together with crypto has supercharged the region\u2019s criminal ecosystem.\u201d\n\nData mining: Another (un)stable coin\n\nFor products that pledge 24/7 stability, stablecoins fail all too often in this sector. We\u2019ve seen it variously with Tether, Circle\u2019s USDC and most dramatically, with the Terra stablecoin that kicked off the market collapse of 2022.\n\nThis week there was another: the TUSD stablecoin. It was issued by a company called TrustToken in 2018 and was once considered a potential rival to the stablecoin market giants Tether and Circle. Now it is the fifth-largest stablecoin, which in market terms, is far behind.\n\nThis week it fell off its peg to the US dollar, trading as low as 97 cents. It has since recovered to 98 cents, but not regained its peg.\n\nThe TUSD team took to Twitter to dismiss the peg break as a short-term arbitrage opportunity, going on to describe the event as a \u201cnormal aspect of market dynamics and liquidity adjustments\u201d. OK.\n\nFT Cryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford. Please send any thoughts and feedback to cryptofinance@ft.com."

        "title": "Bitcoin to $100,000 or Shiba Inu to $0.01: What's More Likely to Happen in 2024? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -7.01%) has risen by around 60% in just the past three months. Hype and excitement ahead of the approval of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has resulted in investors becoming incredibly bullish on crypto of late. At more than $40,000, the digital currency is now trading around the levels it was at two years ago. There's hope that it could hit the $100,000 mark.\n\nAnother popular coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB -10.56%) also has the potential to rise given the overall excitement around crypto these days. In the past, it has been a popular meme coin, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has often tweeted about it. Shiba Inu has been rising in value recently, and given its low token price -- around $0.0000096 on Tuesday -- getting to $0.01 would be a massive return for investors.\n\nWhich scenario looks more probable for 2024: Bitcoin getting to $100,000, or Shiba Inu rising to a value of $0.01?\n\nBitcoin has been falling but there's another catalyst that could be coming\n\nIn what could just be the latest example of investors and speculators buying the rumor and selling the news, Bitcoin's value has been falling in the wake of the Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs. On Jan. 10, the regulator approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, but the value of the digital currency dipped to less than $42,000 by Jan. 13. Bitcoin has rallied since then but it definitely doesn't look to be skyrocketing on the news.\n\nOver time, however, the momentum may build back up if the approval of the ETF has the desired effect -- getting a significantly larger number of more risk-averse investors and crypto novices to put Bitcoin into their portfolios. That's not something that investors should expect to happen overnight.\n\nThere's another catalyst that could help Bitcoin's value rise even further. Every four years or so, the rewards for validating each block of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain (i.e., mining) are cut in half. These \"halving\" events, which are built into the Bitcoin protocol, reduce the rate of token supply growth. The next halving is expected to take place in April.\n\nPrior halvings have been followed by surges in Bitcoin's price. Combine that with the possibility of more investors buying crypto due to spot Bitcoin ETFs now being available, and there could be an even stronger rally this time around.\n\nIs Shiba Inu getting to $0.01 too big of a dream?\n\nShiba Inu isn't nearly as popular as Bitcoin is, but as investors learned a few years ago, everyone loves a good underdog. And with the help of meme investors, Shiba Inu has the potential to rally as more people learn about crypto. While the spot Bitcoin ETFs could make it easier for some people to invest in Bitcoin, they may also lead them to get more interested in other cryptocurrencies.\n\nGrowth investors looking for the next big opportunity may be concerned that Bitcoin, which has a market cap of $840 billion, may simply be too expensive. A smaller coin such as Shiba Inu, which has the potential to captivate meme investors, could be seen as possessing more potential upside. At around $5.7 billion, its market cap is much smaller than Bitcoin's.\n\nThe big question, however, is whether $0.01 is simply too high of a target for the coin to reach. For it to get to $0.01, Shibu Inu's price would need to grow by about 1,100 times. By comparison, Bitcoin would need to grow by 2.5 times to get to $100,000. And if Shiba Inu achieved such a gain, its market cap would be $5.9 trillion, giving it a higher market cap than Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin getting to $100,000 is much more probable\n\nBitcoin is already the larger and more popular coin, and there are no compelling reasons to believe Shiba Inu could skyrocket past it. It might go along for the ride with other cryptocurrencies as they increase in value, but it's highly unlikely that Shiba Inu will lead the charge.\n\nThere are now thousands of cryptocurrencies to choose from and the benefit Bitcoin has is that it has become synonymous with crypto and it's the most popular coin. If someone is going to invest in crypto, it'll likely be with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin may not reach $100,000 this year, but that outcome is much more probable than Shiba Inu getting anywhere near $0.01. Crypto remains risky, but Bitcoin is the safest option compared to all other coins."

        "title": "Roundhill Investments Launches Bitcoin Covered Call ETF (YBTC) - PR Newswire",
        "content": "YBTC is the first U.S. ETF to implement a covered call strategy on bitcoin*, allowing investors to participate in upside exposure to bitcoin* while potentially generating monthly options income.\n\nNEW YORK, Jan. 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Roundhill Investments, an ETF sponsor focused on innovative financial products, is pleased to announce the launch of the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF (YBTC), which begins trading on Cboe BZX today. YBTC is the first bitcoin covered call strategy ETF to list in the U.S.\n\nYBTC seeks to offer investors exposure to bitcoin*, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The Fund employs a covered call strategy on bitcoin ETFs, designed to generate monthly income while providing investors with exposure to the price movements of bitcoin (subject to an upside cap). Historically, bitcoin has exhibited significant volatility, which may allow for the Fund to generate significant options income from its call selling strategy. In turn, the Fund seeks to provide current income to shareholders.\n\nSimilar to gold, bitcoin stands out as an asset that does not yield operating profits or cash flows, presenting a unique challenge for income-focused investors. Traditionally, this gap has led to the popularity of on-chain strategies such as staking for crypto assets like Ether. Meanwhile, YBTC overlays a covered call strategy on bitcoin to allow for investors to retain upside to bitcoin while addressing needs for current income.\n\n\"YBTC offers investors an attractive blend of high income potential and exposure to bitcoin,\" said Dave Mazza, Chief Strategy Officer at Roundhill Investments. \"Investors have clamored for a covered call ETF with exposure to bitcoin and we are proud to be the first to bring such a product to the U.S. market.\"\n\nYBTC seeks to pay distributions, if any, on a monthly basis.\n\n* The fund does not invest in bitcoin directly; it seeks to provide exposure to the price return of an exchange-traded fund that invests principally in bitcoin futures contracts (the \"Bitcoin Futures ETF\"). The fund is not suitable for all investors and involves a high degree of risk.\n\nAbout Roundhill Investments:\n\nRoundhill Investments is a registered investment adviser focused on offering innovative financial products designed to offer exposure to investment themes that appeal to the next generation of investors. To learn more about the company, please visit roundhillinvestments.com.\n\nInvestors should consider the investment objectives, risk, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the ETF please call 1-877-220-7649 or visit the website at https:// www.roundhillinvestments.com/etf/ . Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing.\n\nAll investing involves risk, including the risk of loss of principal. There is no guarantee the investment strategy will be successful. The fund faces numerous risks, including options risk, liquidity risk, market risk, cost of futures investment risk, clearing broker risk, commodity regulatory risk, futures contract risk, active management risk, active market risk, clearing broker risk, credit risk, derivatives risk, legislation and litigation risk, operational risk, trading issues risk, valuation risk and non-diversification risk. For a detailed list of fund risks see the prospectus.\n\nCovered Call Strategy Risk. A covered call strategy involves writing (selling) covered call options in return for the receipt of premiums. The seller of the option gives up the opportunity to benefit from price increases in the underlying instrument above the exercise price of the options, but continues to bear the risk of underlying instrument price declines. The premiums received from the options may not be sufficient to offset any losses sustained from underlying instrument price declines, over time. As a result, the risks associated with writing covered call options may be similar to the risks associated with writing put options. Exchanges may suspend the trading of options during periods of abnormal market volatility. Suspension of trading may mean that an option seller is unable to sell options at a time that may be desirable or advantageous to do. Bitcoin Futures ETF Risks. The Fund will have significant exposure to the Bitcoin Futures ETF through its options positions that utilize the Bitcoin Futures ETF as the reference asset. Accordingly, the Fund will subject to the risks of the Bitcoin Futures ETF, set forth below. Bitcoin Risk. Bitcoin is a relatively new innovation and the market for bitcoin is subject to rapid price swings, changes and uncertainty. The further development of the Bitcoin network and the acceptance and use of bitcoin are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing, stopping or reversing of the development of the Bitcoin network or the acceptance of bitcoin may adversely affect the price of bitcoin. Bitcoin is subject to the risk of fraud, theft, manipulation or security failures, operational or other problems that impact the digital asset trading venues on which bitcoin trades. The Bitcoin blockchain may contain flaws that can be exploited by hackers. A significant portion of bitcoin is held by a small number of holders sometimes referred to as \"whales.\" Transactions of these holders may influence the price of bitcoin. Digital Asset Industry Risk. The digital asset industry is a new, speculative, and still-developing industry that faces many risks. In this emerging environment, events that are not directly related to the security or utility of the Ethereum blockchain or the Bitcoin blockchain can nonetheless precipitate a significant decline in the price of ether and bitcoin. Digital Asset Regulatory Risk. Digital asset markets in the U.S. exist in a state of regulatory uncertainty, and adverse legislative or regulatory developments could significantly harm the value of bitcoin futures contracts or the Bitcoin Futures ETF's share, such as by banning, restricting or imposing onerous conditions or prohibitions on the use of bitcoin, mining activity, digital wallets, the provision of services related to trading and custodying digital assets, the operation of the Bitcoin network, or the digital asset markets generally. Such occurrences could also impair the Bitcoin Futures ETF's ability to meet its investment objective pursuant to its investment strategy. Flex Options Risk. The Fund will utilize FLEX Options issued and guaranteed for settlement by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). In the unlikely event that the OCC becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its settlement obligations, the Fund could suffer significant losses. Additionally, FLEX Options may be less liquid than standard options. In a less liquid market for the FLEX Options, the Fund may have difficulty closing out certain FLEX Options positions at desired times and prices. The values of FLEX Options do not increase or decrease at the same rate as the reference asset and may vary due to factors other than the price of reference asset. New Fund Risk. The fund is new and has a limited operating history.\n\nRoundhill Financial Inc. serves as the investment advisor. The Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC which is not affiliated with Roundhill Financial Inc., U.S. Bank, or any of their affiliates.\n\nGlossary\n\nOptions\n\nAn option is a contract sold by one party to another that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a stock at an agreed upon price within a certain period or on a specific date.\n\nCovered Call Strategy\n\nA covered call strategy involves writing (selling) covered call options in return for the receipt of premiums. The seller of the option gives up the opportunity to benefit from price increases in the underlying instrument above the exercise price of the options, but continues to bear the risk of underlying instrument price declines.\n\nSOURCE Roundhill Investments"

        "content": "BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF has ranked as the most popular of the 11 new funds available on Robinhood in terms of volume, the company's chief brokerage officer Steve Quirk told The Block.\n\n\"The BlackRock one has been the one that's seen the most volume from our standpoint with Grayscale right behind it,\" he said in an interview.\n\n\"It\u2019s basically our customers saying 'We want a low-cost avenue to have this be a component of our portfolio,'\" he continued, adding that \"Grayscale is a sale and it continues to be sale whereas the other ones continue to be largely buys.\"\n\n\n\nAmong Robinhood users who recently chose to buy spot bitcoin ETFs, a third of those customers did so after selling a portion of their existing portfolio, Quirk said.\n\n\"Of all the people that participated in trading these 11 [spot bitcoin ETFs], 33% of the people sold a portion of their portfolio \u2014 so they sold some equity \u2014 and then they bought these [ETFs]. So they basically made this a component of their portfolio.\"\n\nTrading volume\n\nWhile BlackRock\u2019s new ETF is generating more volume on Robinhood, in the broader market, Grayscale has seen the most activity among spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds currently trading. A large portion of Grayscale\u2019s volume has been generated by outflows, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nThe firm\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF is a conversion of its flagship GBTC fund and charges a higher fee than some of its competitors. It's also much larger in terms of assets under management, and investors who had wanted to sell before the ETF conversion faced a hefty discount.\n\nGrayscale didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nSo far, more than 90% of all spot bitcoin ETF trading is going through the top three funds by volume, which are offered by Grayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity. Into their fifth day of trading, the cumulative trading total of all spot bitcoin ETFs was $12.7 billion as of 12:47 p.m. ET.\n\n'Top 20' investment\n\nQuirk, who is bullish about spot bitcoin ETFs, said he is pleased with how popular the new bitcoin-based instruments have been among Robinhood users.\n\n\"If we look at the overall volume in our world, these [ETFs] have worked their way up to the top 20\" most popular investments on the platform,\" he said.\n\nLast week, Robinhood announced it would list all 11 spot bitcoin ETFs on its trading platform.\n\n\"We believe crypto is the financial framework of the future and that increased access to bitcoin via ETFs is a good thing for the industry,\" Johann Kerbrat, general manager of Robinhood Crypto, said at the time.\n\nRobinhood currently has 23 million users."

        "content": "Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar; BlackRock Fund Passes $1 Bln\n\nNewly-minted spot bitcoin ETFs pulled in $3.33 billion in their first five days of trading, as investors enthusiastically embraced the funds after more than a decade of approval delays from regulators concerned about cryptocurrency\u2019s vulnerability to fraud.\n\nAt the same time, the funds largely declined over the past 5 days in tandem with the price of bitcoin. Over the same period, broad market exchange traded funds such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) jumped in price.\n\nThe biggest spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), struggled. The fund, which came to market as a $28.6 billion trust, lost $5.5 billion, or 19% of its value, according to Bloomberg data, likely due to fees that are the highest among the 11 spot bitcoin funds approved Jan. 11.\n\nBlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity\n\nStill, the launch of the investment vehicles appear in their early days to be a rousing success. The funds\u2019 total market capitalization, excluding the Grayscale fund, climbed to $3.25 billion, surpassing silver to become the second largest commodity ETF in the U.S. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the group, pulling in $1.2 billion since Jan. 11, while the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) has grabbed $1.06 billion. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) brought in $393.8 million, the third-most.\n\nName recognition helped BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest ETF issuer, as well as Fidelity, grab the most investor money, etf.com senior analyst Sumit Roy said. Bitwise, a far smaller and lesser-known issuer, has performed well with its BITB fund due to a decision to go to market as a low-fee fund, he said.\n\n\u201cAt nearly $400 million, BITB is punching well above its weight thanks to its category-low expense ratio,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, the inflows for the ETFs from VanEck and WisdomTree have been a disappointment.\u201d\n\nRoy noted that by comparison, precious metals ETFs, commodity funds which have been around for decades, had $120 million in outflows over the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the SEC has allowed ETFs that track bitcoin futures since 2021, it only approved the investment vehicles that give investors exposure to physically backed bitcoin last week after months of anticipation from eager cryptocurrency investors.\n\nThe funds are seeing massive inflows despite a number of major asset manager, including Vanguard, refusing to let investors trade the funds with them. During etf.com\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF webinar, chief investment officer of Bitwise Matt Hougan said he wasn\u2019t surprised, but expected the ETFs to be more widely adopted by traditional finance platforms soon.\n\n\"I would be surprised if there will be firms still holding out after a year because these businesses are responsive to their customers, and people are already clamoring to request access to trade bitcoin ETFs,\u201d he said.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.

        "content": "With Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals looming during an election year, a key debate centers around which U.S. administration is more favorable for Bitcoin adoption: Trump's or Biden's. While the Biden era has seen its share of developments, it's Donald Trump\u2019s presidency that edges out as being slightly more advantageous for Bitcoin\u2019s growth \u2014 at least so far. Take a look at both administrations' stances on Bitcoin and see who is more favorable for Bitcoin adoption.\n\nTrump's tenure was marked by a notable laissez-faire approach to cryptocurrency regulation. This hands-off strategy proved to be a significant catalyst for Bitcoin, and more generally, the markets. The lack of stringent regulations under Trump\u2019s administration allowed for greater expansion within the crypto space, fostering an environment where Bitcoin and blockchain projects could thrive relatively unimpeded.\n\nTrump's economic policies, including tax cuts and deregulation, also contributed to a favorable investment climate, which indirectly benefited Bitcoin. The bullish stock market and a strong appetite for alternative investments during his presidency also spilled over into increased investment in the cryptocurrency arena.\n\nIn contrast, President Joe Biden's administration signals a shift toward a more regulated cryptocurrency environment. While regulation is essential for long-term stability and legitimacy, there's concern that excessive oversight could dampen the innovative spirit of the crypto world. Biden\u2019s focus on regulatory clarity, while beneficial in some aspects, might slow down the growth that Bitcoin experienced during Trump\u2019s era.\n\nUnder Biden, Bitcoin also continues to face challenges in terms of mainstream acceptance and integration into the traditional financial system. While there is progress, the main event people are now watching is spot Bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nWhen weighing both administrations, Trump\u2019s presidency seems to have a slight edge in terms of fostering a more conducive environment for Bitcoin adoption. His administration's relaxed regulatory stance played a key role in allowing the crypto market, especially Bitcoin, to flourish in 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s presidency brings advantages to the Bitcoin ecosystem, it's Trump's administration that provided a more favorable backdrop for Bitcoin\u2019s adoption. This slight bias toward Trump\u2019s era doesn\u2019t discount the ongoing developments under Biden but highlights the impact of regulatory approaches on the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Trump Vs.

This makes it the first among the recently launched Bitcoin ETFs to reach this milestone.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust started trading on January 12, 2024, and has quickly gained traction among investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated and transparent investment vehicle.

As of Thursday, the fund held 25,067 Bitcoin.\n\nRobert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, said: \"We are excited to see IBIT reach this milestone in its first week, reflecting strong investor demand. This is just the beginning. We have a long-term commitment focused on providing investors access to an iShares quality ETF.\"\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust closed Wednesday's trading session at $24.41 and trades at a slight premium of 0.42% relative to the spot price of Bitcoin.

        "content": "After trading for just a week, bitcoin ETFs have exceeded silver ETFs in the U.S. in terms of assets under management.\n\n\"Bitcoin BTC -6.63% ETFs have exceeded silver ETFs in the U.S. in terms of size, driven by the substantial market interest they have received,\" Bitfinex Head of Derivatives Jag Kooner told The Block, adding that pent-up demand for bitcoin has played a crucial role in propelling the digital asset ahead of silver in AUM terms.\n\nSilver was previously the second-leading single commodity ETF in terms of AUM in the U.S. However, spot bitcoin ETF funds, including the conversion of Grayscale's GBTC trust, now hold approximately 647,651 bitcoin, which amounts to $27.5 billion in AUM, according to CC15Capital.\n\nAccording to data from Coinglass, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) currently holds around 619,000 bitcoin.\n\nThat places silver in third position in terms of AUM within a single commodity ETF asset class, with approximately $11.5 billion distributed across five ETFs, according to ETF Database. In comparison, U.S. funds that hold gold have a combined AUM of $96.3 billion, across 19 ETFs.\n\nGrayscale trust conversion into an ETF\n\n\"Grayscale's conversion of its existing bitcoin trust into an ETF created the world\u2019s largest bitcoin ETF overnight,\" Kooner said.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\n\"The level of trading reflects the pent-up demand for these products, and we expect that it will lead to increased liquidity and stability in the market,\" the analyst added.\n\nOn Thursday, which is the fifth day of trading for the new assets, the cumulative trading volume for the 11 funds exceeded $12 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data compiled by The Block.\n\nKooner expects that this strong interest will continue.\n\n\"The ETF issuers have implemented competitive fee structures, featuring a range of discounted fees and fee waivers which should attract more investors and could lead to further competitive pricing among ETF providers,\" he said.\n\n\"While some in the investment community still view cryptocurrencies as risky, the growth of these ETFs could pave the way for more innovative crypto ETFs and new underlying assets such as ether,\" he added."

        "content": "South Korea\u2019s Office of the President has urged the financial regulator to reconsider the possibility of approving a local spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), an official of the presidential office said.\n\nSung Tae-yoon, the chief of staff for policy of the presidential office, said in a briefing on Thursday that the South Korean government is exploring ways to incorporate foreign affairs into local regulations \u2014 which may indicate the country\u2019s openness to launching spot crypto ETFs, local news outlet Maeil Business reported Friday.\n\nThe presidential office\u2019s comment comes after the Financial Services Commission last week warned local firms that brokering foreign-listed bitcoin spot ETFs might be interpreted as a violation of capital market regulations. Following the announcement, several major local securities companies suspended trading of existing foreign spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nElsewhere in Asia\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nWhile South Korea\u2019s government holds a somewhat divided opinion on the possibility of a local spot bitcoin ETF, Singapore and Thailand have said it\u2019s not something they\u2019re considering. The Monetary Authority of Singapore told CNA earlier this week that spot bitcoin ETFs are not granted for offering to local retail investors. Thailand\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission also said this week that it does not plan to approve local firms to launch such ETFs, as reported by the Bangkok Post.\n\nRegional experts have said that Hong Kong could be the next hub in Asia to introduce a local spot crypto ETF, with its financial regulators publishing two circulars in December to address the requirements for such ETFs. Livio Weng, COO of Hong Kong-based crypto exchange HashKey, said last week that 10 fund managers, including some backed by Chinese capital, are looking into launching spot crypto ETFs in the city."

        "title": "Choosing Among Spot Bitcoin ETFs - ETF Trends",
        "content": "I\u2019m a big fan of ETF product development, but sometimes the choices can be overwhelming. For example, on our ETF Database platform there are approximately 90 ETFs offering high yield bond exposure. However, as we recently wrote, there are cost and exposure differences between them that impact performance. Last week, nine new ETFs began trading offering direct exposure to spot bitcoin, while one firm turned a pre-existing product into an ETF. This ETF wave is unlike anything I\u2019ve seen in my career.\n\nVettaFi Crypto Symposium Insights\n\nVettaFi hosted a timely virtual event last Friday. The Crypto Symposium featured experts from eight bitcoin ETFs. We talked about why this is a massive win for the advisor community after a multi-year journey. Yet we also covered some of the risks to be aware of when investing.\n\nIn addition, we heard from advisors and investors. For example, VettaFi asked, \u201cWhen Choosing Among Spot Bitcoin ETFs, What Matters Most to You?\u201d, The most popular selection by respondents was Expertise of the Firm with 47% of the total. Liquidity (20%) and Expense Ratio (18%) followed, with Assets Under Management (11%) and Breadth of Offerings (3.6%) further behind.\n\nVettaFi has long advocated for ETF due diligence efforts to go beyond simply choosing the ETF with the lowest expense ratio. However, with spot bitcoin ETFs, the focus on exposure is largely irrelevant. The ten ETFs all own bitcoin, though the price they will buy it for daily might differ. We think this is unlikely to be noticeable to most investors.\n\nETF Fee Battle Started Early\n\nThe expense ratio difference will be more eye catching thanks to a pre-emptive fee battle. At present, seven of the ETFs were charging a 0.00% fee for at least the first three months or till the fund hits an assets threshold like $1 billion or $5 billion. Even when the fees are no longer waived, the expense ratios for many will be largely aligned. For example, the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC), the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitwise Fund (FBTC) would charge 0.19%, 0.20%, and 0.25%, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) had the overwhelming liquidity advantage out of the gate. GBTC was uplisted into an ETF, charging a 1.5% fee, and has $26 billion in assets. The ETF traded $2.3 billion on its first day. This made it the nineth most actively traded ETF in the U.S., regardless of investment style. GBTC had a two cents average bid-ask spread throughout the day. However, GBTC\u2019s peers, led by the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), collectively traded more than $2 billion the first day according to Bloomberg. Volume for bitcoin ETFs in general remained strong in the subsequent days.\n\nAdvisors Told VettaFi They Plan to Add Crypto Exposure\n\nWe believe education about cryptocurrency remains paramount, given that access via ETFs is new. During the symposium, we learned that 58% of respondents expect to have between 1%-5% of their average client portfolio invested in crypto within three months. This compares favorably to the-just 34% that had similar low single-digit exposure last week.\n\nMany advisors are looking for expertise to help them talk to clients about bitcoin, understand how to value the asset, and keep up with industry developments. Catching a replay of the VettaFi cryptocurrency symposium is a good start, as is visiting the Crypto Channel on this platform. From there, you can contact experts at the firm you most want to work with. One benefit for advisors coming to the Exchange Conference in February will be the ability to speak to those experts directly!\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin surges past silver, becoming second-largest commodity ETF\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust transformation fuels ETF market boom\n\nInvestors embrace new Bitcoin ETFs with enthusiasm, driving high trading volumes\n\nBitcoin has overtaken silver to become the second-largest commodity in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in terms of assets under management (AUM).\n\nBitcoin ETFs reached the milestone within a week of commencing trade. This move suggests a swift and substantial accumulation of investor interest and capital in the cryptocurrency.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Transformation Boosts Bitcoin ETF Market\n\nThe recent surge in the Bitcoin ETF market is largely attributed to Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust converting into an ETF. This move not only established the largest Bitcoin ETF but also enhanced market liquidity. Grayscale now leads spot Bitcoin ETFs with approximately 647,651 BTC, amounting to $27.5 billion AUM .\n\nThis upsurge in Bitcoin ETFs has subsequently relegated silver to third place in the single commodity ETF asset class . Silver ETFs currently manage around $11.5 billion in AUM, spread across five funds. Meanwhile, gold continues to dominate, with $96.3 billion AUM distributed across 19 different ETFs.\n\nBitfinex\u2019s Head of Derivatives, Jag Kooner told CCN that Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded Silver ETFs in the US in terms of size, driven by the substantial market interest they have received.\n\nHe explained:\n\n\u201cGrayscale\u2019s conversion of its existing Bitcoin trust into an ETF, created the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin ETF overnight, boasting over $29 billion in AUM. The level of trading activity we have since seen in the new Bitcoin ETFs reflect the pent-up demand for these products, and we expect that it will lead to increased liquidity and stability in the market.\u201d\n\nHe added the company expects that there will continue to be strong interest.\n\n\u201cThe ETF issuers have implemented competitive fee structures, featuring a range of discounted fees and fee waivers which should attract more investors and could lead to further competitive pricing among ETF providers. While some in the investment community still view cryptocurrencies as risky, the growth of these ETFs could pave the way for more innovative crypto ETFs and new underlyings such as Ether,\u201d Kooner concluded.\n\nEnthusiastic Market Embraces New Bitcoin ETFs with High Trading Volumes\n\nBitcoin ETFs have been met with a positive response from the market. In a just five days, the combined trading volume of the 11 Bitcoin ETF funds exceeded $12 billion. Analysts attribute this to a mix of strong investor demand and competitive fee structures offered by the ETF issuers. These elements are drawing in investors, contributing to improved market liquidity and stability.\n\nFurther emphasizing this trend, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst, pointed out the performance of Bitcoin ETFs in one-week flow comparisons with all ETFs. Notably, two Bitcoin ETFs ranked in the top five and three in the top 10, competing with well-established ETFs like $VOO and $QQQ. This indicates growing investor interest and confidence in Bitcoin as a viable investment option.\n\nAnother way to put the bitcoin ETF flows in ETF context (besides showing their #s relative to past new launches) is how they stack up to ALL ETFs in past 1 week flows. Even after four days two of them are in Top 5 and three in Top 10, up there w the studs $VOO , $QQQ et al. pic.twitter.com/oduhktEqwG \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 18, 2024\n\nGold\u2019s Price Surge Still Reflects Complex Market Dynamics\n\nGold prices have recently shown a significant upward trend , reaching an all-time high of over $2,100 per ounce on December 4, 2023. This was been driven by a mix of factors, including a weaker dollar and speculation about the Federal Reserve\u2019s reluctance to maintain aggressive rate hikes.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which measures the dollar\u2019s value against other major currencies, has fallen more than 3% since early October. Additionally, geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, have played a role in boosting gold\u2019s value.\n\nThe World Gold Council (WGC) has reported strong demand for gold , especially from central banks. In the first nine months of 2023, central banks purchased a record 800 tons, a substantial portion of the total demand. This buying streak is expected to continue for the remainder of the year. China and India are the two biggest gold buyers, accounting for more than half of global demand.\n\nBitcoin vs. Gold ETFs: Navigating the Duality of Volatility and Stability\n\nAs we progress through 2024, both Bitcoin and gold ETFs are witnessing pivotal moments. Bitcoin ETFs are at the forefront of reshaping the cryptocurrency market. Meanwhile, gold ETFs maintain their significant status in traditional investment strategies.\n\nThe decision between investing in Bitcoin or gold ETFs largely hinges on individual investor preferences and risk tolerance. Gold ETFs offer a more conventional and stable investment, anchored to a tangible commodity. On the other hand, Bitcoin ETFs present an opportunity to engage with a more volatile, yet potentially high-return digital asset. This choice epitomizes the diversified and evolving nature of today\u2019s investment landscape.\n\nIn 2004, the first gold ETF launched in the US. 20 years later, it\u2019s #Bitcoin \u2019s turn. pic.twitter.com/qkxdhZ0Wo9 \u2014 Binance (@binance) January 14, 2024\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s crucial for investors to thoroughly understand the inherent volatility and uncertainties associated with these markets before committing to substantial investments."

        "content": "The next Bitcoin halving is just around the corner, which will have significant impact on not just the Bitcoin price but the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. We detail everything you need do know about the Bitcoin halving date and the wider impact of the upcoming halving event.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin halving?\n\nBitcoin relies on blockchain technology to securely function. As part of this, Bitcoin mining refers to the distributed consensus system that confirms pending transactions by including them in the blockchain in chronological order. Transactions are subject to strict cryptographic rules, which are verified by the system, as they are packed in blocks to be added to the chain. This ensures security of the network because it\u2019s not possible to modify previous blocks without invalidating the entire chain of subsequent blocks.\n\nThe halving policy was written into Bitcoin\u2019s mining algorithm in an attempt to counteract inflation by maintaining scarcity. The Bitcoin code dictates that the reward for miners is reduced by half after every 210,000 blocks are created, which is the event we call a Bitcoin halving. As long as demand for Bitcoin remains the same, the Bitcoin halving, in theory, will lead to an increase in price.\n\nBitcoin halving date\n\nBlocks of transactions are added approximately every 10 minutes, which means that the Bitcoin halving cycle is roughly four years. The next Bitcoin halving is due to occur in 2024, with current date estimates and Bitcoin halving countdowns estimating the exact date to be April 17th, 2024.\n\nHow many Bitcoin halvings have there been?\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency created and was officially launched in January of 2009. Since then, there have been three historical Bitcoin halvings which have reduced the reward for miners. The initial reward in 2009 was 50 BTC, which would be worth over \u00a31,000,000 today. At the moment, pre-2024 halving, the mining reward stands at 6.25BTC, which is approximately \u00a3224,693.\n\nBitcoin halving price chart:\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nSource: Techopedia\n\n\n\n2024 Bitcoin halving price prediction\n\nAfter the 2024 halving, the reward for miners will stand at 3.125 BTC. Designed to maintain scarcity, Bitcoin halvings generally led to an increase in Bitcoin prices.\n\n\u201cHistorically, there is a lot of Bitcoin price volatility leading up to and after a halving event. However, the price of Bitcoin typically ends up significantly higher a few months after,\u201d comments Rob Chang, CEO of Gryphon Digital Mining.\n\nWhile the first halving in 2012 did not have a significant impact on Bitcoin prices due to the cryptocurrency\u2019s infancy, the second halving in 2016 led to a 194% increase in Bitcoin prices, and the third having in 2020 increased prices by 100%.\n\nMarket uncertainty in 2023, combined with the shockwaves caused by the collapse of the cryptocurrency platform FTX, make it harder to predict the impact the 2024 Bitcoin halving will have on price. While experts remain cautiously optimistic about a 2024 rebound in crypto investment, the upcoming halving is not a guaranteed catalysts for prices as Bitcoin remain a high-risk asset in a current environment of economic uncertainty.\n\nWhat happens when there is no Bitcoin left to mine?\n\nFrom the get-go, there has been a limit of how many bitcoins will be mined. The maximum number of bitcoins is 21 million, and once that number is reached, no new bitcoins will be issued. Current estimates show that we are likely to reach the 21 million in 2140.\n\nOnce there is no Bitcoin left to mine, miners will no longer receive block rewards and will instead have to rely on transaction fees for compensation. It is likely that once this point is reached, Bitcoin will become deflationary as coins can be lost through human error, i.e., if a user sends Bitcoin to an invalid address."

In batches of up to 1,000 BTC, the firm has sent a total of 16,712 BTC worth more than $726 million to the crypto exchange so far, data from Arkham Intelligence reveals.\n\nThe \"GBTC dumping send $BTC to sub 30k\" narrative is a weak one when you actually look at the numbers/data. Yea, $GBTC has been selling off with consistent net outflows since the launch of the 9 $BTC ETF's, but the reality is that the inflow to the other 9 ETF's has outweighed\u2026 https://t.co/A23oAQEzTh \u2014 CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) January 19, 2024\n\nThe largest volume of transfers to Coinbase occurred on Wednesday when Grayscale offloaded 11,712 Bitcoins. As news of the transactions spread, the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply, but the dip was followed by a strong rebound.\n\nIn the long run, however, GBTC redemptions have the potential to drive a more pronounced downtrend.\n\nHow GBTF Outflows Impact the Price of Bitcoin\n\nAlthough significant, transactions related to GBTC redemptions in the last week represent just a small fraction of more than 19.6 million BTC in circulation. They are, therefore, unlikely to be the primary catalyst for the bearish conditions that have characterized the market since last Thursday.\n\nNevertheless, the company still holds over half a million Bitcoins \u2013 more than enough to influence the overall market should outflows continue at their current pace.\n\nAtlascap invest said that in the next 1-2 months, the selling pressure of Grayscale GBTC will directly affect the price of Bitcoin. At this outflow rate, the net outflow of Grayscale GBTC should have no more than two months of impact on Bitcoin price fluctuations. JPMorgan\u2026 https://t.co/qtAmVGzKJX \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 19, 2024\n\nNoting that GBTC redemptions have already released thousands of additional Bitcoins on the market, Atlascap Invest predicts that the selling pressure will directly affect the cryptocurrency\u2019s price in the next 1-2 months.\n\nConsidering that GBTC\u2019s management fees are significantly higher than those charged by its peers, the recent exodus of capital may be driven by investors who plan to relocate to cheaper alternatives. As such, Atlascap anticipates the negative impact of GBTC redemption pressure lasting no more than 2 months. Long term, the firm predicts that demand from other ETFs will ultimately push the price of Bitcoin up."

        "title": "Some IBDs Limiting Advisor Use of Bitcoin ETFs - Wealth Management",
        "content": "Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 proposals for spot Bitcoin ETFs, in a significant shift for the industry\u2019s relationship to cryptocurrency.\n\nThe ETFs may be approved, but some independent broker/dealers have put restrictions in place for their affiliated advisors, in many cases not allowing advisors to recommend them to clients and only taking orders if the client asks first.\n\n\u201cThe approvals are not really an indication of the SEC\u2019s feelings about whether or not these fit a portfolio for a client,\u201d said Adam Handler, vice president of product management at Axtella (formerly SPS Family), the parent company of two independent b/ds and one registered investment advisor. \u201cIt\u2019s more around following suit with what they\u2019ve done with other securities to make sure there\u2019s surveillance against fraud and other market manipulation capabilities and there\u2019s volume and a tradable market for them.\u201d\n\nAxtella, which has 716 advisors and more than $22 billion in assets under management, does not currently allow the products on the platform. Handler says the firm will consider in an upcoming product committee meeting whether advisors will be allowed to make unsolicited trades on behalf of clients in the future.\n\n\u201cBest interest\u201d doesn\u2019t apply for broker/dealers when a client makes an unsolicited request for an investment, but even in the case of an unsolicited request, a fiduciary standard may apply on the fee-based side of the platform, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you take on an asset under the advisory side of the business where you\u2019re charging a fee, you have the fiduciary responsibility now to make recommendations on that asset, and holding it in a portfolio\u2014even if it\u2019s a discretionary account where you\u2019re not formally going to a client and communicating with them and saying \u2018Hey we need to sell this, or buy this,\u2019 just holding it in a portfolio and charging on ongoing fee is the equivalent of a hold recommendation,\u201d Handler said.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which was converted into an ETF, has been the most requested bitcoin product by Axtella advisors, and it too is not allowed on the platform.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to justify from a diligence standpoint to say that, \u2018Hey I\u2019ve researched what you\u2019re investing in enough to tell you this is a good investment for you.\u2019 These vehicles as they stand today are purely speculative,\u201d Handler said.\n\nAxtella expects to educate its advisors on the products, so that clients who come to them wanting to invest understand what they\u2019re buying. But the firm does not plan to put a formal training program in place.\n\n\u201cAs it stands right now, I\u2019m not sure I understand what I would put into a formal training program around these assets. That\u2019s one of the big problems,\u201d Handler said.\n\nCambridge Investment Research is restricting its 3,800 advisors from buying the funds, until they go through a training program which the firm is currently creating, said Seth Miller, president of advocacy and administration and general counsel. Once they go through the training, advisors will be able to access the ETFs.\n\n\u201cWe understand and agree with the regulators that these are complex products, and in order to be able to recommend that complex product, the financial professionals really need to understand how the product works, what the risks and benefits are, so that they can make a best interest recommendation to the client,\u201d Miller said.\n\nSome 250 advisors have requested the training, with 74 of them having completed the training as of Thursday morning. The training consists of 51 slides, with no audio, and includes several \"Knowledge Check\" questions throughout. The program was developed by RegEd, the firm's education and training provider for compliance education, product training and annual compliance programs.\n\nPrior to the SEC approvals, Cambridge was allowing advisors to use other bitcoin products, including those from Grayscale and Bitwise Asset Management. But advisors had to adhere to the b/d\u2019s guidelines limiting the concentration of \"complex products\" in a client's portfolio. Advisors who use the ETFs will also be subject to those concentration guidelines and exposure will count toward the aggregate limit across all complex products.\n\n\u201cIf they are already hitting our threshold or our ceiling on complex products and they want to buy one of these new ETFs, they wouldn't be able to,\u201d Miller said.\n\nCetera Financial is currently developing a policy around advisor use of bitcoin ETFs, and expects \u201ca prudent embrace of these new offerings\u201d by the end of the first quarter, said Matt Fries, head of investment products and partner solutions at Cetera, in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cWith 46 million Americans already owning a share of bitcoin, more investors are exploring incorporating cryptocurrency into their investment portfolios,\u201d Fries said. \u201cWe are working to provide our advisors with the education and guidance to help their clients potentially invest in these products. We are thoughtfully adjusting our existing protocols for new products in the market, and our investment products team is developing a comprehensive policy on bitcoin ETFs for our advisors.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth Financial Network is also not currently allowing its more than 2,100 advisors to recommend the ETFs, nor to discretionarily add them to client portfolios, according to a source close to the IBD, who declined to be named. Advisors are limited to accepting only unsolicited orders for the products.\n\nA spokeswoman for the firm declined to comment.\n\nThe source said the ETFs are in a similar situation to the marijuana ETFs that first came to market in 2015. Because a lot of the marijuana-related businesses inside the ETF deal in a product that is still federally illegal, many IBDs only allowed advisors to accept unsolicited orders for them. They weren\u2019t allowed to provide any sort commentary or guidance on investing in them whatsoever, he said.\n\nHandler said his firm had a full prohibition on those ETFs when they first came out, and there are still some restrictions in place because the underlying product is still federally illegal.\n\nLPL Financial said GBTC is currently the only bitcoin ETF approved for use at the nation's largest independent broker/dealer, with some 22,000 advisors. The firm will not immediately make the new ETFs available, but it is conducting diligence to do so later, with the appropriate controls in place, said Kate Winters, senior vice president of wealth management services.\n\n\u201cThe firm will follow its existing diligence process for approving ETFs,\u201d Winters said.\n\nBut the firm\u2019s advisors must complete required training and meet additional account-level requirements to place orders. Once they meet those requirements, advisors are allowed to solicit purchases in both brokerage and advisory accounts, and they are allowed to use discretion with available ETFs in advisory accounts.\n\nLPL will not be limiting trades to only unsolicited orders, as some others have.\n\n\u201cLPL believes providing advisors with investment product choice is essential for advisors in addressing their client\u2019s needs and wants,\u201d Winters said.\n\nSpokespeople for Osaic, Atria Wealth Solutions, Kestra Financial, Raymond James Financial and Edward Jones declined to comment on the availability of the Bitcoin ETFs on their platforms.\n\nVanguard made it clear that spot Bitcoin ETFs would not be available on its platform, with a spokesperson saying the firm has \u201cno plans\u201d to offer the ETFs or other crypto-related products, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe ETFs are available to trade on Schwab's platforms, and UBS said it was offering some of the ETFs to clients with who approached advisors without being advised to invest in them. Merrill Lynch has also said the ETFs will be available to \u201celigible\u201d clients, referring to ultra-high-net-worth customers with $10 million in assets.\n\nWells Fargo is also moving to provide access to the spot Bitcoin ETFs, with a firm spokesperson saying they are \"available for unsolicited purchases through an advisor with Wells Fargo Advisors\" or via the firm's online WellsTrade platform."

        "content": "Outflows from GBTC are pushing down prices in crypto markets, JPMorgan said Thursday.\n\nIf GBTC loses its liquidity advantage it could see an additional $10 billion in outflows, the bank said.\n\nSpot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have clocked up big volumes in the first week of trading, yet Bitcoin has fallen 11%. JPMorgan blames investors ditching Grayscale\u2019s ETF.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, GBTC, has seen over $1.5 billion in outflows since January 11. The exodus has acted as an \u201cadditional drag for crypto markets,\u201d JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a report shared with DL News on Thursday.\n\nThings could get worse for GBTC, as the investment bank estimates an additional $10 billion could leave the fund.\n\n\u201cLiquidity and market depth also matter but again there is risk for GBTC on that front also if other spot Bitcoin ETFs manage to reach critical mass in terms of size and liquidity,\u201d JPMorgan said.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nLiquidity typically refers to the ability to sell an asset for cash. Less liquidity poses a risk for investors as they could find it hard to sell their shares.\n\n\u201cA lot more capital, perhaps an additional $5 billion to $10 billion, could exit GBTC if it loses its liquidity advantage,\u201d the report said.\n\nPrice pressure\n\nFollowing the fund\u2019s conversion from a close-ended trust, investors have taken the opportunity to exit their GBTC positions. Some of these investors \u201chave been taking full profit post ETF conversion by exiting the Bitcoin space entirely rather than shifting to cheaper spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d the report said.\n\nBased on JPMorgan\u2019s estimates, which were made pre-approval, Panigirtzoglou says another $1.5 billion could leave GBTC in the next few weeks. This would put further pressure on Bitcoin\u2019s price, the report said.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cWhatever the motive behind the past few days\u2019 $1.5 billion of outflows from GBTC, these outflows are exerting pressure on GBTC to lower its fees,\u201d the report noted, referring to the fund\u2019s 1.5% management fee.\n\nGrayscale is charging far more than its competitors. Ark Invest launched with zero fees for the first year and 0.21% thereafter. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with $10 trillion in assets under management, charges 0.12% for the first year, or on the first $5 billion, rising to 0.25% after that.\n\nInflows into these competing funds have been \u201cdecent,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s report said. The inflows are comparable to previous Bitcoin-related launches, such as Bitcoin futures on the CME and Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\n\u201cMost of this $3 billion of inflow reflects a rotation from existing Bitcoin vehicles,\u201d JPMorgan said. But it\u2019s not just institutional investors that are moving money. Retail traders appear to be shifting from exchanges to cheaper spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOn-chain cumulative Bitcoin flows by smaller wallets. (JPMorgan)\n\n\u201cSmaller Bitcoin wallets, typically attributed to retail investors, have seen some retrenchment in recent days,\u201d the bank said. JPMorgan uses on-chain cumulative Bitcoin flows of smaller wallets as a proxy for these investors.\n\nAdam Morgan McCarthy is a markets correspondent for DL News. Have a tip?

The crypto market is known for its volatility but has captured the attention of investors looking for new ways to profit in their portfolios. First-time investors commonly need guidance on crypto matters, such as choosing a coin or calculating taxes on crypto trading proceeds.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Investors view crypto assets like Bitcoin as an investment vehicle and seek advice on investing in the market.\n\nFinancial advice from internet searches can be misleading.\n\nCrypto coin hype commonly causes investors to fear they might miss out.\n\nProfessional crypto financial advisors can help guide first-time investors.\n\n\n\nWhy Crypto Advice Is Useful\n\nCrypto-centric communities on major social media platforms are plentiful, with many sharing advice on various topics. Some tokens will do well, while others will be average performers. Unfortunately, as crypto innovations are created, scammers find new methods to defraud unsuspecting individuals.\n\nConsulting a cryptocurrency advisor before investing in a cryptocurrency can help investors make decisions with less risk of being scammed. They are informed about crypto laws and regulations. A crypto financial advisor will bring a professional outlook on the crypto industry, help build a lower-risk crypto portfolio, track crypto trading activities, and prepare taxes effectively.\n\n\n\nCertified Advisors\n\nA certified crypto financial advisor can help investors create and manage a portfolio that includes cryptocurrency. They may hold a Certificate in Blockchain and Digital Assets (CBDA) or a Certified Digital Asset Advisor (CDAA) credential issued by businesses and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\n\nA crypto financial advisor may hold blockchain or digital assets certification. These certificates should not replace the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) or Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) certificates but should be held in tandem.\n\nEducation Platforms\n\nBinance is a cryptocurrency exchange offering a platform for users to buy and sell crypto coins.

(CFP Board) released guidance about cryptocurrency-related assets to help CFP professionals. The Notice to CFP Professionals Regarding Financial Advice About Cryptocurrency-Related Assets was developed in response to questions about financial advice on cryptocurrencies and crypto-related assets.\n\nThe CFP Board recommends professionals follow regulatory guidance when giving financial advice about crypto-related assets since both the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Financial Industrial Regulatory Authority (FINRA) see potential risks when investing in crypto-related assets. In March 2022, the DOL's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) published compliance assistance, warning 401k plan fiduciaries against cryptocurrency investments.\n\nInvestors can add cryptocurrencies to their portfolio by investing in crypto directly or through an investment vehicle like an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\n\n\nIn Jan. 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot market bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) listed on the NYSE Arca, Cboe BZX, and Nasdaq exchanges.

Investors can ask the advice of another personal financial advisor or browse the internet and explore credible websites like The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA).\n\nHow Do Investors Verify the Credentials of a Crypto Financial Advisor? An advisor\u2019s credentials can be verified by checking their records with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) Board of Standards, and other membership organizations with which the advisor is associated.\n\nWhat Questions Should Investors Ask a Crypto Financial Advisor? Investors can ask a financial advisor if they think cryptocurrencies are a good financial asset, how to invest in crypto, and if the advisor holds any crypto investments.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHiring a qualified crypto financial advisor can help investors manage many matters that arise from investing in a new asset.

        "title": "Impact of Bitcoin ETFs: 'Revolutionary change' or colossal 'dud'? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After pushing for more than a decade, the cryptoverse finally got what it wanted: Bitcoin (BTC) for sale and trading on major United States stock exchanges \u2014 albeit in the form of an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nBut be careful what you wish for. No sooner had the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) handed the crypto sector a belated Christmas gift 10 years in the making than Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price pulled downward again.\n\nMany predicted that this drawback would happen, and it\u2019s probably just a hiccup, but it raises questions about the aftereffects.\n\nWill the SEC approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10 have long-term reputational consequences for Bitcoin, offering further validation that crypto has moved into the economic mainstream?\n\nWill the ETFs really bring back customers who were burned during the crypto winter? Are individual investors ready to dive back into Bitcoin after the past years\u2019 bankruptcies, scandals and price gyrations?\n\nWhat if major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity build their Bitcoin ETFs and nobody comes? What is the probability that the new ETFs \u2014 appearing for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the Chicago Board Options Exchange on Jan. 11 \u2014 will fail to gain traction with investors?\n\nReputationally enhanced?\n\nRegarding enhancements of the so-called Bitcoin brand, \u201cI believe SEC approval will cement Bitcoin\u2019s reputation,\u201d John Nahas, senior vice president of business development at Ava Labs, told Cointelegraph.\n\nBitcoin was already in the economic mainstream before the approval, in his view, but the new U.S. ETFs \u201cwill only reinforce the early adopters, further solidify its many supporters and begin to convert the remaining skeptics,\u201d explained Nahas. It will no longer be seen as a fringe or exotic asset but as one embraced by traditional financial players.\n\nChris Brodersen, managing director at business advisory and accounting firm EisnerAmper, was more measured, suggesting that what really matters still lies ahead. SEC approval is just that \u2014 \u201capproval of a non-security commodity\u201d \u2014 not an endorsement, he told Cointelegraph. \u201cHowever, the result of the approval will be an expansion in the discussion of Bitcoin, its underlying technologies and ultimately its value in a diversified portfolio.\u201d\n\nThe real importance of the increased investment into cryptocurrencies that may come from the ETFs is that it will potentially \u201cserve as a catalyst for innovation and adoption,\u201d said Brodersen, adding:\n\n\u201cLooking beyond the ETFs, the question still remains: How will the crypto ecosystem engage with the broader financial ecosystem?\u201d\n\nShayne Higdon, co-founder and CEO of the HBAR Foundation, told Cointelegraph something similar, emphasizing the importance of the underlying technology, which now gets a closer look from the public at large: \u201cWhile many investors and crypto advocates view Bitcoin as digital gold, the underlying value of blockchain technology is often overlooked.\u201d\n\nRecent: Avalanche embraces memecoin culture despite criticism\n\nIn the meantime, Bitcoin itself still has some ways to go. \u201cMass adoption and price appreciation are needed before Bitcoin can earn this \u2018precious commodity\u2019 status, and true validation will only occur if asset managers, private wealth management advisers, and similar entities invest in Bitcoin over the coming year,\u201d said Higdon.\n\nWill a spot market Bitcoin ETF attract retail investors in any significant way? Are individual investors ready to dive back into crypto after the past years\u2019 bankruptcies, scandals and price gyrations after the so-called crypto winter?\n\nThere are reasons to think that last week\u2019s events can make a difference on this score. Nahas said that ETF approval gives new assurances and security at the governmental level and institutional level, further explaining:\n\n\u201cThese [asset managers] are longstanding, deeply entrenched financial institutions that perform extensive due diligence. They would not support any asset unless they had thoroughly vetted it and there was substantial demand.\u201d\n\nEstablished firms like BlackRock and Fidelity are supplying a needed function for small investors. Cryptocurrencies demand a certain level of technical and self-custody know-how that lies beyond the realm of many rank-and-file investors.\n\nGenerally speaking, mass market consumers aren\u2019t ready for cryptocurrency exchanges or noncustodial wallets, according to Nahas.\n\nRegarding the continued effects of the so-called crypto winter on potential retail investors: \u201cDespite the recent challenges related to volatility caused by scandals and bankruptcies owing to things like Terra, FTX and Celsius, there remains a significant interest in the opportunity of owning cryptocurrency by retail investors,\u201d opined Brodersen.\n\nAn \u201cinvestable commodity \u2014 like any other\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still perhaps too early for most consumers to appreciate the difference that crypto ETFs can make. Individual investors now have the ability to hold BTC \u2014 and perhaps ETH too soon \u2014 alongside their stocks, bonds and other tradable assets, said Nahas, adding:\n\n\u201cMost people are not comprehending the enormity of the barrier that has been lifted, making the ETF an easily investable commodity like any other.\u201d\n\nOthers say what retail investors do or do not understand could be beside the point. \u201cWhether the average person is ready for Bitcoin may not be all that important right now because their advisers will bring them in anyway,\u201d said Henry Robinson, founder of the Decimal Digital Group, a cryptocurrency mining, infrastructure and technology company.\n\nIn the increasingly competitive race to surpass investment benchmarks, \u201cwealth managers will not be able to afford to ignore Bitcoin because they risk losing to their peers,\u201d said Robinson. They will \u201chave to take some exposure.\u201d\n\nWhat if no one comes?\n\nBut what if Bitcoin ETFs fail to gain much traction with retail investors? What happens then?\n\n\u201cThe probability of this is almost zero,\u201d Higdon told Cointelegraph. \u201cLarge asset managers would not have put forth the effort to file and create an ETF if there wasn\u2019t significant demand from their clients.\u201d Those issuers, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, et al., simply want to provide a regulated means for their clients.\n\n\u201cIf ETFs are a dud, we may see capitulation from buyers over the last six months who intended to front run higher prices than were realized,\u201d said Robinson. The result could be another extended bear market.\n\nBTC price briefly spiked and then dropped following the ETF approvals. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nCrypto ETFs are really just a temporary fix anyway. \u201cOver time, we expect ETF holdings to peak and then dwindle in BTC terms,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to hold BTC in a wrapper for a maintenance fee.\u201d\n\nOne of Bitcoin\u2019s major advantages as a store of value is its costless storage, which doesn\u2019t really jibe with ETFs, even though the latest round of ETF issuers have gone to lengths to discount fees, at least initially. \u201c[ETFs] role in greater [BTC] adoption can\u2019t be understated, but they are also temporary,\u201d said Robinson.\n\nThe notion that \u201cnobody comes\u201d is not likely, Brodersen added. \u201cOnce the initial excitement wears off, we\u2019re likely to witness a relatively slow but increasing interest by retail investors.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the potential upside is enormous. Even 1\u20132% allocations, if done at scale, \u201ccould have an outsized impact on the overall market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market,\u201d said Brodersen.\n\nNahas, too, was confident that the new ETF issuers had already effectively scoped out customer demand. \u201cBlackRock and their peers would not be in business if they speculated on what assets would have demand or not,\u201d he said, adding:\n\n\u201cDemand comes from clients. That is what\u2019s driving this ETF. Many of these issuers were not inclined to support any digital assets, and now they are issuing a Bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nA watershed moment?\n\nWill people one day look back on last week\u2019s events as a historic milestone in the journey of the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency?\n\n\u201cWe do believe this is a watershed moment for Bitcoin,\u201d said Robinson, though there may be a BTC availability shortage soon, he added:\n\n\u201cBitcoin taken off the market by ETFs is setting up a supply squeeze. The new capital will catapult the industry to a manyfold greater integration with global finance.\u201d\n\nGauging historical \u201ctipping\u201d points can be tricky, of course, and a matter of endless debate. \u201cThe true watershed moment for Bitcoin was the release of its white paper and the mining of its genesis block,\u201d said Brodersen. Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin white paper was published in October 2008, and the first Bitcoin was mined in January 2009.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this is a positive step toward increased adoption and investment in the digital asset space,\u201d acknowledged Brodersen, but mass adoption will require more than the \u201csynthetic exposure to the price of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nRecent: On-chain data in a volatile market: How traders stay ahead of the curve\n\nIt will also require better regulatory frameworks, as well as a deeper understanding, generally, of the costs and benefits of decentralized ledger technologies \u2014 \u201cand, most importantly, the demand for such alternatives.\u201d\n\nHigdon was more sure of last week\u2019s significance. \u201cWe will look back on this day as the catalyst that sparked revolutionary change in the finance and banking world. While the exact extent of this change is yet to be known, we cannot overstate the significance of this approval.\u201d"

But it\u2019s already been raking in money, suggesting that demand for a regulated bitcoin investment vehicle is strong.\n\nSince trading on January 11, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), data from VettaFi show that it\u2019s already brought in nearly $91 million of investor capital.\n\n\u201cMany advisors recently told VettaFi they are looking to add a small slice of client portfolios to Bitcoin in the first half of 2024,\u201d said VettaFi\u2019s head of research Todd Rosenbluth. \u201cThe cryptocurrency can offer an alternative to equities and fixed income.\u201d\n\nSee more: \u201cWhat Sets Invesco\u2019s Spot Bitcoin ETF Apart From Peers\u201d\n\nOpening the Floodgates for Spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nBTCO began trading alongside nine other spot bitcoin funds that the SEC approved. Other notable spot bitcoin ETFs that launched on Jan. 11 include the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). BlackRock, Fidelity, WisdomTree, and VanEck also launched funds last week.\n\nProviding Bitcoin Exposure While Mitigating Risk\n\nBTCO provides bitcoin exposure while mitigating the risk of managing personal digital wallets and dealing with unregulated crypto platforms. The fund charges 39 basis points. However, Invesco is waiving BTCO\u2019s entire fee on assets up to $5 billion for the first six months after launch.\n\nInvesco launched BTCO in partnership with Galaxy Asset Management, one of the world\u2019s largest digital assets and blockchain investment managers. Invesco said in a statement that Galaxy has \u201cdeep knowledge of digital assets and experience in investing across all stages of the ecosystem.\u201d This should \u201cstrengthen the operational risk management of the ETF.\u201d\n\nResearch from Galaxy suggests that, with a base portfolio of 55% equities, 35% fixed income, 10% commodities, allocating 1% to bitcoin shows \u201cthe strongest marginal improvement to a portfolio\u2019s risk-adjusted return.\u201d\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Innovative ETFs Channel."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recent approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sent ripples of excitement through the global crypto community. This milestone has been heralded as a game-changer, with industry experts anticipating significant shifts in the market dynamics.Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder of Mudrex, asserts, \"The SEC's approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs will attract institutional investors who were previously cautious due to regulatory concerns. There will be increased institutional interest which could further lead to higher liquidity and more stability in the market, which may have a global impact, including in India.\"Positive developments in the US crypto space often have a ripple effect on global market sentiment. Edul emphasizes that \"As the SEC's approval is now seen as a vote of confidence in the legitimacy and maturity of the crypto market, this is set to boost confidence among investors worldwide. As regulatory bodies are also monitoring the global regulatory trends, it is likely that regulators in India might adjust the policies or approach towards crypto-related financial products.\"While the immediate effects might be evident in the Bitcoin market, the legitimization of crypto investment through regulated spot ETFs has broader implications. Edul Patel notes that this could attract a diverse investor base, encouraging increased capital flows across various cryptocurrencies. Notably, major players like BlackRock have already filed for Ethereum spot ETFs, and the industry is eagerly awaiting potential approvals in this space.Looking ahead, the confluence of ETF approvals, the upcoming halving, and regulatory clarity sets the stage for a promising year for Bitcoin. Patel predicts, \"The year 2024 holds immense promise for Bitcoin, as the confluence of ETFs, halving, and regulatory clarity is set to drive demand. It is expected that BTC will cross its previous highs of 69k.\" The anticipation is not only for short-term gains; Patel forecasts a substantial influx of 5-7 billion in the next three months, with institutions potentially allocating 1-3% of their capital to Bitcoin over the long term (2-5 years).On January 10, 2024, the US securities regulator approved the first US-listed exchange-traded funds to track bitcoin, in a watershed for the world's largest cryptocurrency and the broader crypto industry.Spot Bitcoins that have received approval from the US financial regulator include Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF , Hashdex Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund. Similarly, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, the VanEck Bitcoin Trust, the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund, the Fidelity Wise Original Bitcoin Fund and the Franklin Bitcoin ETF.(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "title": "100 days out: What the Bitcoin halving means after BTC ETF approvals - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Crypto Twitter has been immersed in the speculation and anticipation of the eventual approval of the spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.\n\nAfter some turbulence caused by an alleged fake tweet from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, all 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved.\n\nThe ETF hangover is over, and attention can now shift to the next big event: the Bitcoin halving. The biggest Bitcoin event has less than 100 days to go. The past halvings have directly correlated with Bitcoin\u2019s bull runs, but could the spot Bitcoin ETFs influence the price of BTC in this halving cycle, interfering with short- and long-term Bitcoin price predictions?\n\nWhat is the Bitcoin halving?\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is an event that occurs approximately every four years, reducing the rate at which new BTC units are generated and earned by miners in the Bitcoin network. Specifically, miners\u2019 reward for validating and adding new blocks to the blockchain is reduced by half.\n\nThe initial reward started at 50 BTC per block, and after each halving event, it decreased by half. The most recent halving occurred in May 2020, reducing the reward to 6.25 BTC per block. The next Bitcoin halving, estimated to occur in mid-April 2024, will reduce the Bitcoin mining rewards to 3.175 BTC per block.\n\nThis process is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol. It is designed to create scarcity, mimicking the scarcity of precious metals like gold. The cryptocurrency community closely watches the halving events, as they impact the overall supply of Bitcoin and can have implications for market dynamics and the value of the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin is a relatively young digital asset with a short history. Many fundamental analysts find it hard to provide a precise value due to its novelty and alleged revolutionary factors.\n\nLooking at Bitcoin\u2019s history, the halving has had a consistent effect on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nHalving 2012: Bitcoin is dead\n\nThe first halving occurred on Nov. 28, 2012, and reduced the block reward from 50 to 25 BTC. The price of BTC at the time of the halving was $13, peaking the following year at $1,174.\n\nIn 2012, Bitcoin wasn\u2019t taken too seriously by the mainstream. It was popular among cypherpunks, which nurtured the technology from its infancy. The price of BTC became a marketing tool for the digital asset once it surpassed the benchmark of $1,000, making headlines in the mainstream media.\n\nAs Bitcoin was an unknown intangible asset many didn\u2019t comprehend, it was condemned as dead once the price pulled back to $200. The phrase \u201cBitcoin is dead\u201d would become common in the media in the following years, but the digital asset survived.\n\nHalving 2016: The retail speculation bubble\n\nThe second halving transformed Bitcoin from an underground cryptocurrency into a legitimate asset class. The halving occurred on July 16, 2016, reducing the block reward to 12.5 BTC. The price at the time of the halving was $664; the following year, it peaked at nearly $20,000.\n\nRetail investors jumped into the new wave of altcoins, pushed by the initial coin offering (ICO) boom, which was made possible thanks to the new attributes offered by Ethereum\u2019s blockchain. ICOs flooded the market, but many were incomplete projects, and some were outright scams, bringing much criticism to the crypto market as a whole.\n\nRecent: Impact of Bitcoin ETFs: \u2018Revolutionary change\u2019 or colossal \u2018dud\u2019?\n\nThe rise after this halving was considered a mere retail speculative bubble. However, Pandora\u2019s box had already been opened, and the blockchain industry would emerge from the halving.\n\nHalving 2020: The arrival of smart money\n\nWhen the third halving arrived on May 11, 2020, reducing the block award to 6.25 BTC, BTC was worth $9,734. A new all-time high (ATH) came the following year at $69,045.\n\nThis halving cycle caught the attention of billionaire investors such as Paul Tudor Jones and Michael Saylor, co-founder and then-CEO of software company MicroStrategy.\n\nSaylor became the first CEO to hold Bitcoin on his company\u2019s balance. As the price of BTC surged, MicroStrategy\u2019s stock value rose with it. Saylor\u2019s approach inspired other prominent businessmen, like Elon Musk.\n\nRecent: Impact of Bitcoin ETFs: \u2018Revolutionary change\u2019 or colossal \u2018dud\u2019?\n\nMusk\u2019s Tesla purchased Bitcoin, and a new wave of funds and companies followed Saylor\u2019s steps to allocate certain percentages of their treasury into Bitcoin.\n\nAs with the last two halvings, the price of BTC plunged after it reached a new ATH.\n\nThe halving cycle pattern\n\nThroughout these halving cycles, a consistent pattern has emerged. There appear to be five stages to a Bitcoin halving cycle:\n\nSignificant rally before the halving\n\nBrief correction\n\nPeriod of consolidation\n\nMajor bull run\n\nSteep correction.\n\nThe ATH occurred approximately 18 months post-halving. This represents a simplified yet accurate depiction of the previous three cycles.\n\nPlanB, one of the most popular \u2014 yet controversial \u2014 analysts in the cryptocurrency space, summed up a simple strategy for investors, especially those not inclined to engage in active trading, which respected the theory of the halving cycles.\n\n[Buy bitcoin 6 months before a halving and sell 18 months after a halving] has historically beaten [buy&hold]. The next halving is in April 2024 ... will this strategy work again?https://t.co/9kjaCUulwb pic.twitter.com/cbO80Ym7iC \u2014 PlanB (@100trillionUSD) July 3, 2023\n\nThe strategy involves buying BTC six months prior to the halving and taking profits 18 months later from its date.\n\nWhat to expect for the upcoming Bitcoin halving\n\nAs with the last halving, there is a narrative that BTC\u2019s price will rise higher than the previous bull run\u2014and reach a new ATH. In this cycle, the spot Bitcoin ETF approval was the next milestone the market was expecting.\n\nThe upcoming halving is less than 100 days away, and market observers are optimistic about the possibility of a new Bitcoin ATH.\n\nBasel Ismail, CEO of investment analytics company Blockcircle, told Cointelegraph he believes BTC\u2019s price will increase as the halving gets closer but said that the trading activity of the spot Bitcoin ETFs may affect the crypto market.\n\nIsmail compared the gold ETF launch in 2004 and its effects on the price of gold. A pattern emerged where an increase in gold\u2019s price correlated with net gold inflows and decreased with net outflows, suggesting a feedback loop influenced by cash transactions in the physical gold market.\n\nIn his opinion, the spot Bitcoin ETF will mirror the behavior of the gold ETF, potentially acting as an accelerant to Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. Substantial inflows should positively affect BTC\u2019s price, but this can be a double-edged sword.\n\nLead-lag analysis indicates that inflows can create price momentum and price changes can influence flows, thereby accentuating both positive and negative market trends. When the gold ETF was launched, the price of gold fluctuated, as marked in the following graph.\n\nThe arrows point to a confluence of variables (price action, volume action, multiple leading technical indicators action and momentum action), which support how gold was in a range-bound sideways accumulation zone.\n\nGold was unable to break out above it for two-thirds of the year. Each time momentum rose, the price pulled back into the same price range. As the market heated up, the selling pressure outweighed the buying pressure.\n\nFor Ismail, this analysis provides insight into how a spot Bitcoin ETF might similarly influence Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nIsmail expects a pullback in the first month after the ETF approvals, stating that the market\u2019s expectations for a rapid BTC price surge after the ETF approval were too high. He claimed that impatience in the market could result in a rapid shift to a pessimistic trend and result in a downward spiral.\n\nDue to this stagnation in market activity, the crypto trader thinks that negative trends could lead to news cycles that will draw down the price of BTC. The market will then frame it as an \u201cunderwhelming response to Bitcoin ETFs being approved.\u201d For Ismail, the horizontal trend could be caused by two factors: a weak and volatile market sentiment and the accelerant effect of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBitcoin post-halving 2024 prediction\n\nIf the reduced supply of new BTC is not accompanied by significant demand, prices will unlikely surge. The spot Bitcoin ETF has eclipsed all the media attention on the possible inflow of money from traditional to crypto markets. But what about the retail investors?\n\nIsmail highlighted several signs indicating that investor sentiment is improving, including an increase in web traffic to Bitcoin\u2019s Wikipedia page, Google search volume for multiple Web3 keywords, a new wave of X (formerly Twitter) followers to prominent layer-1 blockchain and tier-1 centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs) and more.\n\nEven if he predicts some months of downside pressure for BTC, he expects Bitcoin to break a new ATH after the halving, reaching as high as $100,000\u2013$150,000 in late 2025.\n\nRecent: Avalanche embraces memecoin culture despite criticism\n\nPrior to the spot Bitcoin ETF approval, several predictions had been made. When 2023 reached its end, artificial intelligence applications suggested $120,000 as the average predicted ATH for BTC. Others predicted higher valuations still.\n\nMultinational bank Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin will reach $200,000 by late 2025, pushed by the ETF approval. Others, such as PlanB, forecast BTC peaking at $532,000 following the halving cycle as indicated in his stock-to-flow model. ARK CEO and founder Cathie Wood predicts Bitcoin will reach $1.5 million by 2030.\n\nWith the arrival of the spot Bitcoin ETF, crypto investors have high morale and trust in BTC\u2019s price for the upcoming months, so patience may be required."

Now that spot ETFs have been approved, launched and taken wins, it\u2019s time to consider other influences, such as interest rates.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nFollowing dovish signals from the US Federal Reserve in December, market participants factored in multiple interest rate cuts in 2024, which would have been a boon for Bitcoin\u2019s price. Those hopes are now fading.\n\nLower interest rates benefit risk assets like Bitcoin as investors take more risk in search of returns.\n\nThis also increases the money supply, which would impact Bitcoin due to its high correlation, Fidelity Digital Assets noted in its 2024 outlook.\n\nBut investors can\u2019t bank on rate cuts. Several Fed policymakers have warned against cutting rates too soon. European Central Bank Chief Christine Lagarde shared similar hawkish remarks, saying optimism isn\u2019t helping the fight against inflation.\n\nFedWatch Markets are pricing in a 52% probability of a rate cut in March, down from 79% a week ago. (CME /CME)\n\nThe market responded by repricing its expectations this week. The probability of the Fed cutting rates by 25 basis points in March has fallen to 52% from 77% a week ago, according to the CME\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nThe US dollar is also influenced by rate cuts, and it\u2019s been performing well since the beginning of January. The dollar index is up nearly 2% so far this year, signalling improved strength in the dollar relative to other currencies.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has a negative relationship to the dollar. When the dollar is performing well Bitcoin has historically underperformed. Its continued strength poses a significant headwind for Bitcoin.\n\nUrsula Von der Leyen (Andr\u00e9s N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Rita Fortunato)\n\nThe EU is about to outlaw and restrict some of the most prized features in crypto\n\nRestricting self-custody wallet payments.

        "content": "Total net flows from the first five days of trading for the new U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs now stand at nearly $1.2 billion, with Fidelity joining BlackRock in the $1 billion-plus inflows club yesterday, according to data from BitMEX Research.\n\nBitwise is currently in third place with $395.5 million worth of inflows, while Ark Invest/21Shares and Invesco have seen a total of $320.9 million and $194.9 million, respectively. Overall, 10 of the 11 ETFs have seen inflows totaling almost $3.4 billion so far, with Grayscale notching up $2.2 billion in outflows. The remaining funds have all witnessed less than $100 million worth of total inflows.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs see biggest day of net outflows since launch\n\nOverall, the spot bitcoin ETFs witnessed net outflows of $131.6 million yesterday \u2014 the largest so far \u2014 with GBTC significantly eclipsing inflows from the other funds.\n\nDespite 10 of the 11 ETF products generating a total of $447.9 million worth of inflows, it was not enough to overcome $579.6 million in outflows from Grayscale\u2019s converted fund, according to BitMEX Research.\n\nFidelity (FBTC) and BlackRock (IBIT) spot bitcoin ETFs led yesterday\u2019s inflows, attracting $177.9 million and $145.6 million, respectively. Invesco (BTCO) witnessed the third-largest inflows for the day at $59 million, while Ark Invest/21Shares (ARKB) saw $41.8 million and Bitwise (BITB) $20.1 million. Flows for the remaining ETFs were flat on Thursday.\n\nYesterday was the second day of net outflows, having returned to net inflows of $474 million on Wednesday. Tuesday also saw $40.5 million in outflows, compared to $229.4 million worth of inflows on day two and $628.5 million on day one.\n\nGrayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity continue to dominate trading volume and AUM\n\nGrayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s spot bitcoin ETFs continued to dominate trading volume yesterday, with almost $2.1 billion in volume across all the funds adding to a cumulative total approaching $14 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data compiled by The Block.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s GBTC contributed nearly $1.1 billion to Thursday\u2019s trading volume, with BlackRock\u2019s IBIT and Fidelity\u2019s FBTC generating $416 million and $367 million, respectively.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nThe big three also dominate in terms of assets under management, according to the latest data compiled by The Block. GBTC currently shows an AUM of $25.6 billion, with IBIT and FBTC at $1.1 billion and $875 million, respectively.\n\nPutting that into perspective, VanEck Digital Asset Strategy Director Gabor Gurbacs said, \u201cThe Bitcoin BTC -6.63% ETFs are a force of nature. They took in 25x El Salvador\u2019s bitcoin holdings, about the size of Tether\u2019s bitcoin assets on reserve, 39% of MicroStrategy\u2019s $8 billion and exceeded silver ETFs\u2026 all in a single week.\u201d\n\nBitcoin price falls and could face more pressure from GBTC profit-taking\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price briefly fell below $41,000 yesterday amid the net outflows from the spot ETFs before recovering slightly. Bitcoin is currently trading at $41,379, according to The Block\u2019s price page \u2014 down 3% over the last 24 hours and around 10% since the ETFs launched on Thursday last week.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market cap could face further pressure on its price should GBTC investors continue to take profits, according to analysts at JPMorgan. Last week, JPMorgan estimated up to $3 billion in GBTC outflows as speculative investors were likely to take profits.\n\n\"If the previous $3 billion estimate proves correct and given $1.5 billion has exited already, then there could be an additional $1.5 billion still to exit the bitcoin space via profit-taking on GBTC, thus putting further pressure on bitcoin prices over the coming weeks,\" JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note on Thursday.\n\nGBTC investors \u2014 who over the past year had been buying the fund's shares at a significant discount to net asset value to position for a potential ETF conversion \u2014 \"have been taking full profit post-ETF conversion by exiting the bitcoin space entirely rather than shifting to cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs,\" the analysts said."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) could have dropped $9,000 last week because of a single whale, a new theory suggests.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Jan. 18, James Van Straten, research and data analyst at crypto insights firm CryptoSlate, drew attention to a massive entity selling BTC.\n\nOne Bitcoin whale, $100 million profit?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 15% dive from $49,000 highs, which began on Jan. 11, is widely attributed to a \u201csell the news\u201d event as part of the United States approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nFor Van Straten, however, there is a new contender on the radar.\n\nAnalyzing the realized price of the BTC supply \u2014 the price at which coins last moved \u2014 a conspicuous decrease at the highs stands out.\n\nHis research implicated an unknown entity in the proceedings. This investor purchased a giant hoard of 100,000 BTC during Bitcoin\u2019s run to all-time highs in 2021, worth $4.8 billion at the time.\n\nLast week, having held the position through the subsequent BTC price drawdown, the whale finally broke even \u2014 and the chance to sell at $49,000 was too good to pass up.\n\n\u201cThis is why (in my opinion) on Jan. 12, Bitcoin had its largest 1-day drawdown since the FTX collapse and tanked after the ETF started trading,\u201d Van Straten wrote alongside data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode.\n\nEven with just $1,000 between the entry and exit, the size of the whale\u2019s BTC stack would have netted them a cool $100 million profit \u2014 still a worthy prize despite enduring Bitcoin\u2019s longest-ever bear market.\n\n\u201cI assumed they would have held due to holding a 75% unrealized loss,\u201d Van Straten continued.\n\n\u201cThen that sent the market into a frenzy, combined with liquidations, \u2018sell the news,\u2019 and record loss-taking.\u201d\n\nBitcoin entity-adjusted realized price distribution chart.

That's not enough IMO.

        "title": "Why MicroStrategy Stock Dip Offers a Lucrative Bitcoin Play - And It's Better Than ETFs - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s stock plunged by 33% after Bitcoin ETF approval, sparking a broader sell-off in related stocks.\n\nThe company, which has a noteworthy Bitcoin stash, is a compelling proxy for Bitcoin despite its modest market cap.\n\nBoth technical and fundamental indicators point to MicroStrategy\u2019s stock being undervalued and oversold, signaling a favorable buying opportunity.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) recently faced a significant downturn, plummeting by 33% from its latest peak. This decline coincided with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for American markets, triggering a broader sell-off in Bitcoin-related stocks. The argument against MicroStrategy lies in the belief that there are superior alternatives for gaining exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nThis trend isn\u2019t exclusive to MicroStrategy because the new Bitcoin ETFs have led to a widespread decline in most Bitcoin-related stocks. Despite concerns about companies with high multiples, MicroStrategy stands out due to its substantial Bitcoin holdings, making its multiples less relevant.\n\nMicroStrategy vs ETFs\n\nMicroStrategy boasts the second-largest holding of Bitcoins, approximately 190,000, trailing only Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which owns nearly 650,000 BTC, valued at around $28 billion.\n\nDespite neither being a Bitcoin fund nor an ETF, MicroStrategy, a software company with a stable and profitable enterprise, stands out for its financial approach. By converting its cash holdings into Bitcoin and leveraging low percentage debt, it has amassed a significant Bitcoin stockpile now valued at approximately $8.2 billion.\n\nEven after a post-ETF approval sell-off, MicroStrategy\u2019s market cap is only around $7.5 billion. This makes it an attractive proxy for Bitcoin. Considering its software business, with projected sales of around $550 million next year, its fair value could be estimated at $11.5 billion, aligning with a Bitcoin value of around $43,000.\n\nThe Financial Prophet manager and investor Victor Dergunov said : \u201cWhile MicroStrategy\u2019s stock should benefit as Bitcoin rises, its current valuation seems disconnected. Following Benjamin Graham\u2019s wisdom \u2013 \u201cThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but it\u2019s a weighing machine in the long run\u201d \u2013 recent spot Bitcoin ETF approvals have led the market to vote \u201cNo\u201d for MicroStrategy.\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis has caused a significant price drop, creating a mispricing opportunity. As the market returns to weighing MicroStrategy\u2019s true value, its share price is expected to be repriced significantly higher, reflecting both its Bitcoin and software enterprise value.\u201d\n\nBuy The Dip\n\nMicroStrategy witnessed a significant 33% decline from its recent peak of around $725 a few weeks ago. This correction was spurred by the stock surging beyond $700. Despite the pullback, MicroStrategy is now notably undervalued, trading below $500.\n\nThe recent surge in trading volume, among the highest recorded for the stock, suggests that the selling pressure may have been excessive, potentially paving the way for a rebound.\n\nCrucial technical indicators, including RSI, CCI, and the full stochastic, indicate that MicroStrategy is entering oversold territory. This alignment of oversold technical conditions with a fundamentally undervalued scenario suggests the potential for a strong recovery soon.\n\nMicroStrategy Or The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust?\n\nDergunov said: \u201cMany may wonder why we choose to hold MicroStrategy instead of the now-available GBTC. While GBTC offers a solid option, its trading on a major exchange reduces the likelihood of pricing discrepancies.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cGiven that GBTC should closely mirror Bitcoin\u2019s price, and as one may already own Bitcoin through a cryptocurrency exchange, holding GBTC seems redundant in this case. Instead, I prefer exploring Bitcoin-related opportunities in stocks.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the strategic decision of companies like Tesla, Coinbase, and Marathon Digital Holdings to hold Bitcoin instead of traditional cash on their books aligns with Dergunov\u2019s preference.\n\nThe Financial Prophet manager said: \u201cMicroStrategy stands out for its bold move, strategically acquiring Bitcoin at an average price of around $31,000. With Bitcoin currently trading around 40% above MicroStrategy\u2019s average purchase price, there\u2019s a promising outlook for further appreciation.\u201d\n\nI'm going to push back on Bill Miller IV's pitch that \"MSTR is better than the ETF\"https://t.co/xwYPD0Ij9N Let's examine his arguments one at a time 1. \"MSTR is more liquid than the ETF \"It's the largest owner of Bitcoin in the world\". This is not true GBTC is 3 times the size\u2026 \u2014 Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) January 13, 2024\n\nWhile the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is a top Bitcoin ETF, MicroStrategy distinguishes itself as an ideal Bitcoin proxy. It offers unique opportunities for trading around market peaks and troughs. Additionally, the elevated option premiums on MicroStrategy make it an excellent candidate for the covered call dividend (CCD) strategy.\n\nDergunov said: \u201cBy valuing MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin stockpile at approximately $8.2 billion, considering Bitcoin at $43,000, and projecting the software business to generate around $550 million in sales by 2025, we arrive at a fair value of approximately $11.5 billion. If Bitcoin reaches $50,000, MicroStrategy\u2019s potential worth could be nearly $12.8 billion. Accounting for long-term debt of $2.2 billion brings the current valuation to $9.3 billion, with a potential valuation of $10.6 billion if Bitcoin hits $50,000,\u201d\n\nMSTR Risks And Future Value\n\nWith Bitcoin hovering around $50,000, MicroStrategy\u2019s potential valuation stands at approximately $10.6 billion, while its current market cap is only around $7.5 billion. Presently valued at $9.3 billion, MicroStrategy\u2019s market cap would need to surge by 24% to align with its fair value. This suggests that, with Bitcoin around $43,000, a reasonable target for MicroStrategy\u2019s stock is approximately $600.\n\nConsidering a Bitcoin price of $50,000, MicroStrategy\u2019s market cap should theoretically increase by 40%. This would imply a target stock price of $680. Exploring further, if Bitcoin reaches its all-time high of $69,000, MicroStrategy\u2019s market cap could reach around $14.2 billion. This would signal a 90% upside and a stock price target of approximately $920.\n\nMicroStrategy $MSTR co-founder Michael Saylor has been selling shares of the company daily leading up to the \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 SEC's approval of the Bitcoin $BTC ETFs The sales likely netted Saylor more than $20 million. It is the first time he has sold shares in nearly 12 years \u2013 Bloomberg pic.twitter.com/B80NUBl2GK \u2014 Evan (@StockMKTNewz) January 12, 2024\n\nIn the event of a new Bitcoin all-time high at $75,000, MicroStrategy\u2019s market cap may reach approximately $15.4 billion, presenting a 105% upside. This dynamic suggests a stock price range of $920 to $995 for MicroStrategy.\n\nDespite the optimistic outlook, MicroStrategy does face significant risks, primarily tied to a decline in Bitcoin (BTC) prices. Any drop in Bitcoin\u2019s value would likely impact MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price. Additionally, the inversion of MicroStrategy\u2019s premium could lead to steeper declines in its stock price compared to Bitcoin.\n\nCompany-specific challenges, such as revenue and profitability issues, could further contribute to a decline in sentiment and stock price. Investors should carefully assess these and other risks before considering an investment in MicroStrategy."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world's first cryptocurrency, has gained significant popularity over the years. This digital asset has revolutionized the way people perceive money and investment opportunities. In this article, we will explore the concept of Bitcoin investment and mining and its potential benefits.\n\nBitcoin Investment\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin can be a prudent financial decision for individuals seeking diverse investment portfolios. Bitcoin offers a decentralized and secure method of storing and transferring value. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by any central authority, such as a government or financial institution. This decentralization provides several advantages for investors.\n\nPotential for High Returns\n\nOne of the primary reasons why people invest in Bitcoin is its potential for high returns. Bitcoin's price has experienced significant fluctuations over the years, reaching unparalleled highs. For instance, in 2017, the price soared to nearly $20,000 per Bitcoin. Although the price can be volatile, many investors have reaped substantial profits from their initial investment.\n\nDiversification\n\nAnother advantage of investing in Bitcoin is diversification. Traditional investment vehicles, such as stocks and bonds, are subject to market conditions and economic stability. Bitcoin, on the other hand, operates independently from these factors, making it an attractive addition to an investment portfolio. By diversifying their investments, individuals can potentially reduce risk and increase overall returns.\n\nKeep Reading Navigating US Oil Price Trends\n\nHedge against Inflation\n\nInflation can erode the purchasing power of traditional currencies. Bitcoin, with its finite supply capped at 21 million coins, provides an alternative hedge against inflation. This fixed supply ensures that Bitcoin retains its value and cannot be devalued through excessive printing or manipulation. By investing in Bitcoin, individuals can protect their wealth from the effects of inflation.\n\nBitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoin mining is the process through which new Bitcoins are created and transactions are validated on the blockchain network. It involves solving complex mathematical problems using specialized hardware and software. Miners, in return for their computational efforts, are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins.\n\nSecuring the Network\n\nMining plays a crucial role in securing the Bitcoin network. As miners validate transactions and add them to the blockchain, they ensure the integrity and immutability of the network. Without miners, the Bitcoin network would be vulnerable to attacks and fraud.\n\nEarning Rewards\n\nApart from contributing to network security, mining also allows individuals to earn rewards in the form of Bitcoins. The more computing power a miner contributes, the greater their chances of earning rewards. However, due to the increasing difficulty levels and competition, mining has become more resource-intensive over time. Many miners now join mining pools to combine their computing power and increase their chances of earning rewards.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin investment and mining offer unique opportunities for individuals looking to participate in the digital currency revolution. Investing in Bitcoin can provide high returns, diversification, and protection against inflation. Meanwhile, mining contributes to network security and offers the chance to earn newly minted Bitcoins. As with any investment, it is essential to do thorough research and consider risks before participating in Bitcoin investment and mining."

The statement also highlights the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a viable investment option among mainstream traditional financial firms.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s growing integration\n\nJohnson said the launch of Franklin Templeton\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is a strategic response to the increased use of Bitcoin in transactions and its integration into the broader financial system.\n\nShe added that the technology underpinning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has created \u201cdiverse and novel investment opportunities\u201d that will continue to evolve.\n\nReflecting on Bitcoin\u2019s role in global finance, Johnson echoed BlackRock CEO Larry Fink\u2019s sentiments regarding Bitcoin as a hedge against oppressive governments. She shared insights into how Bitcoin serves as a safety net for individuals in unstable regimes.\n\nJohnson gave examples of people who turned to Bitcoin after the government confiscated their assets and people who held Bitcoin to protect themselves against sudden and violent inflation.\n\n\u201cThere is a fear component to it that is considered almost an insurance or a safety component.\u201d\n\nCommitted to adoption\n\nJohnson said that such use cases are the foundation of what makes Bitcoin valuable to humanity as a tool to protect freedom. However, the industry is still in its nascency, and holding Bitcoin is very complicated for the average person who is not tech-savvy.\n\nJohnson said the Bitcoin ETFs allow people to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to deal with the complicated nature of the technology. She added that ETFs make Bitcoin more accessible, which ultimately is a good thing for adoption.\n\nJohnson said that Franklin Templeton has been bullish on the crypto industry for a number of years and first delved into tokenizing assets on a public blockchain in 2021. She added that the firm has been at the forefront of adoption and remains committed to that approach.\n\nShe said the firm will continue to create investment products that its customers want, whether its in the form of crypto ETF or mutual funds. However, she did not elaborate further on the company\u2019s future plans.\n\nMentioned in this article"
