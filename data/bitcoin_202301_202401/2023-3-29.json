        "title": "Bitcoin climbs above $28,000 as investors shrug off regulatory crackdowns - CNBC",
        "content": "Bitcoin climbed sharply Wednesday as investors shrugged off initial fears surrounding U.S. regulators' crackdowns on industry giants and became willing to take some risk.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency rose 3.9% to $28,399.63, according to Coin Metrics. Bitcoin has retaken the $28,000 level after dipping below it on Monday following news that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission FTC's lawsuit against Binance. Earlier in the day it rose as high as $28,637.25.\n\nEther, the second-biggest digital coin, rose 1.7% to $1,808.29.\n\nBitcoin has been steadily rising this year after a brutal 2022 that saw collapses of major crypto exchanges and a sharp slump in prices. Investors have taken some comfort from the thought of a reversal in the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking moves, which put pressure on risk assets like stocks.\n\nThe reason for the jump Wednesday was not immediately clear. However, it comes amid a broad rise in U.S. stocks. Bitcoin has been known to follow movements in equity markets, with investors treating it like more of a traditional risk asset.\n\nU.S. regulators have sharpened their crackdown on crypto firms of late, with the CFTC suing Binance and its co-founder Changpeng Zhao for allegedly breaking trading rules by courting clients in the U.S. without authorization.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has also threatened to take legal action against Coinbase for alleged violations of securities rules.\n\n\"Broadly we are looking quite bullish here with Bitcoin reclaiming $28K and looking to target $30K next,\" Vijay Ayyar, head of international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC via email Wednesday.\n\n\"In general, when price action starts to absorb negative news this quickly, it indicates that the market is bullish and trending upward. The CFTC case against Binance, while quite important, doesn't seem to have affected the market that much.\"\n\nBitcoin had earlier gotten a boost from woes in the global banking system. Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse was recently rescued by its peer UBS in a government-backed, cut-price deal.\n\nU.S. tech-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank and crypto-oriented banks Silvergate and Signature have also failed.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has sought to cushion the blow of the banking crisis with a lending program known as the Bank Term Funding Program, or BTFP, which aims to help banks meet their obligations to depositors.\n\nProponents of bitcoin say it can serve as a store of value in times of economic distress and a form of money people can access without the need for a bank account.\n\nHowever, it is incredibly volatile and has been known to swing up or down 10% in a matter of hours.\n\n\"The market seems to be placing greater importance on macroeconomic factors and that the Fed has already begun a form of QE, now known as BTFP, but also that the interest rate pivot might happen sooner than later,\" Ayyar told CNBC.\n\n\"Against the bank failure backdrop over the past month or so and bitcoin's rise, this provides the perfect context for bitcoin to continue remaining bullish and move higher.\"\n\nWATCH: Crypto enthusiasts want to remake the internet with \u2018Web3.\u2019 Here\u2019s what that means"

        "title": "Top Fiat Currencies Used to Trade Bitcoin - Investopedia",
        "content": "Bitcoins can be earned either by mining them or receiving them as payment for providing goods or services\u2014or by exchanging them against fiat currencies (such as the U.S. dollar or the Japanese yen), or against other cryptocurrencies.\n\nKey Takeaways You can purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies on a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nSome people purchase cryptocurrencies to use as everyday currencies, while others treat crypto coins as an investment similar to buying stock.\n\nThe most-traded national currencies for Bitcoin are the U.S. dollar, the South Korean won, the Japanese yen, and the European Union's euro.\n\nDue to government regulations, the Chinese yuan holds 0% of the market share of currencies traded for Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWho Buys Bitcoin?\n\nRapidly changing Bitcoin valuations have fueled a high volume of speculative trading activity around the globe. Many people who trust blockchain technology and the monetary ecosystem based on Bitcoin are purchasing virtual currency as long-term investments.\n\nIf Bitcoin is increasingly accepted by all genres of businesses\u2014from local coffee shops to large corporations\u2014that could help fuel the adoption of it as a virtual currency. Before making a purchase, some people may compare whether they are better off paying for an item in fiat currencies or in Bitcoins.\n\nFor others, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are investment assets, similar to a stock or futures contract. They purchase these currencies with their local fiat currency just as they would buy shares through a brokerage.\n\nTop Fiat Currencies for Bitcoin Trades\n\nCoinhills provides a list of the most traded national currencies for trading Bitcoin-based on information from currencies, markets, and exchanges registered at Coinhills. The data below is as of March 29, 2023.\n\n1. U.S. Dollar (USD)\n\nThe American dollar currently ranks first on the list of fiat currencies trading Bitcoins, with around 85.4% of the market share. The consistent top rank of the U.S. dollar in Bitcoin dealing is because of several factors.\n\nA quick adopter of any new technology, the U.S. found a large user base in the blockchain-based Bitcoin, which quickly gained traction in the country. Meanwhile, many other nations and their regulators were slow to embrace the development of Bitcoin. For example, in populous countries like India, individuals who are holding bitcoins directly or through intermediaries have bought them by first converting the Indian rupees to U.S. dollars and then using the dollars to purchase the bitcoins.\n\n2. Korean Won (KRW)\n\nThe South Korean won ranks second, with 5.1% of the market share. This is up from the fourth most-traded in 2021.\n\nThe share of KRW in Bitcoin trading declined for a while after 2018 because the country's regulators banned cryptocurrency traders in Korea from using anonymous bank accounts. The country's finance minister at the time, Kim Dong-Yeon, mentioned that \u201cthere is no intention to ban or suppress cryptocurrency (market).\" In 2020, Korea became one of the first countries to pass comprehensive cryptocurrency laws.\n\nWhen Bitcoin prices surged in 2021, however, about 10% of the population invested in cryptocurrencies. However, though they are a popular investment, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not treated as legal tender in South Korea.\n\n\n\nWith a nearly 4% market share, the Japanese yen comes in third when used for dealing in Bitcoin. Japan was previously the leader for many years thanks to multiple bans imposed by the Chinese government on China-based Bitcoin exchanges since September 2017. All those Bitcoin trading activities from China swiftly moved abroad, benefiting Japan the most.\n\nJapanese regulators were also some of the earliest adopters and among the most accommodating of the virtual currency. They have been very proactive in putting up the necessary regulations and have promptly streamlined Bitcoin trading, enabling it to gain a large share of the global market.\n\nThe currency of Europe, the Euro, ranks fourth on the list with a 2.9% market share in trading Bitcoin. Part of what hinders the Euro's growth when it comes to buying Bitcoin is that it remains confined to certain regions. The German city of Berlin has been welcoming to Bitcoin, with the Netherlands and Belgium also serving as important hubs for cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nNo Chinese Yuan\n\nInterestingly, the Chinese yuan no longer figures into the list of top fiat currencies used to trade Bitcoins. In 2014 and 2015, as the Chinese yuan was devalued, it surged to the top rank, beating both the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar. It maintained its lead until late 2017. However, amid increasing state-imposed regulations and crackdown on illegal Bitcoin trade, the dealings have rapidly moved to other venues, including Japan and Hong Kong, leaving the yuan out of the top list. As of March 2023, it ranked 44th, with a 0% market share.\n\nIs Bitcoin Stable? Bitcoin, and the entire cryptocurrency market, are known for being highly volatile and unstable. Recent problems and scandals in the industry have increased this instability. The collapse of the FTX exchange at the end of 2022 shook the entire market, causing it to lose billions in value overnight and leaving many investors unlikely to recover their money.\n\nHow Do I Buy Bitcoin? You can buy Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency on a crypto exchange. You can fund your account on the exchange using your bank account, credit card, or debit card, then exchange your dollars or other currency for coins. These coins are then stored in a cryptocurrency wallet, where they can be held, used as currency, or traded in the future.\n\nWhat Is the Highest Price Bitcoin Has Had? Bitcoin reached an all-time high price of $68,789 in November 2021. A year later, in November 2022, its price had dropped as low as $15,460.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile new Bitcoins are created through mining, existing ones can be purchased by using fiat currencies on a cryptocurrency exchange. The most-traded national currencies for Bitcoin are the U.S. dollar, the South Korean won, the Japanese yen, and the European Union's euro. Due to government regulations, the Chinese yuan holds 0% of the market share of currencies traded for Bitcoin.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other initial coin offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "content": "Will Bitcoin keep minting more millionaires or is this just a 'dead cat bounce'? Here's why Warren Buffett believes crypto 'will come to a very bad ending'\n\nAre you a fan of roller coaster rides? Have we got the investment for you: Bitcoin.\n\nDon\u2019t miss\n\nThrill-seekers and earnest crypto fans have spent the last few years watching the alternative investment rise and fall \u2014 sometimes with exhilaration and sometimes with that sinking stomach feeling.\n\nAfter hitting an all-time peak of around $69,000 per unit on November 10, 2021, the world's leading digital currency has since erased roughly 60% of its value, sitting at about $26,800 right now.\n\nTo be sure, bitcoin has rallied once again over the last several weeks, up nearly 62% so far in 2023.\n\nBut what would the world's most famous investor say to those who might be thinking of buying Bitcoin right now?\n\n\u201cIf you ... owned all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it,\u201d Warren Buffett told CNBC earlier this year.\n\nOther than Bitcoin's disappointing track record, here are three more reasons Buffett won\u2019t go near it.\n\n1. It has \u2018no unique value at all\u2019\n\nThe billionaire investor doesn\u2019t like Bitcoin because he considers it an unproductive asset.\n\nBuffett has a well-known preference for stocks of corporations whose value \u2014 and cash flow \u2014 come from producing things. But cryptocurrencies don\u2019t have real value, Buffett said in a CNBC interview in 2020.\n\n\u201cThey don't reproduce, they can't mail you a check, they can't do anything, and what you hope is that somebody else comes along and pays you more money for them later on, but then that person's got the problem.\u201d\n\nThough Bitcoin is intended to provide real value as a payment system, that use is still pretty limited. As Buffett sees it, Bitcoin\u2019s value comes from the optimism that someone else will be willing to pay more for it in the future than you\u2019re paying today.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. He doesn\u2019t think crypto counts as money\n\nBuffett has made his share of extremely cutting remarks about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency over the years: \u201cI don't have any Bitcoin. I don't own any cryptocurrency, I never will,\u201d he told CNBC back in 2020.\n\nAs a tradeable asset, Bitcoin boomed. But does it meet the three criteria of money? According to the most common definition, money is supposed to be a means of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account.\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nBut Buffett calls it a \u201cmirage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not meet the test of a currency,\u201d the billionaire said on CNBC in 2014. \u201cIt is not a durable means of exchange, it's not a store of value.\u201d\n\nHe adds that it\u2019s a very effective way of anonymously transmitting money. But: \u201ca check is a way of transmitting money too,\u201d he said. \u201cAre checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money?\u201d\n\n3. He doesn\u2019t understand it\n\nBuffett became one of the most successful investors in history by sticking with stocks he understands.\n\n\"I get in enough trouble with things I think I know something about. Why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don't know anything about?\u201d\n\nBut people like to gamble, he told CNBC after a 2018 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, which is another problem with nonproductive assets.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand it, you get much more excited than if you understand it. You can have anything you want to imagine if you just look at something and say, \u2018that\u2019s magic.\u2019\u201d\n\nHow does Buffett pick winning stocks?\n\nThe billionaire investor follows the value investing strategy \u2014 which focuses on buying undervalued stocks of strong companies and holding them for a long time.\n\nSimple, right?\n\nBerkshire Hathaway looks for companies with a good profit margin and those that produce unique products that can\u2019t easily be substituted. As Warren Buffett once said in a letter to his shareholders, \u201cIt\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\u201d\n\nBut Buffett\u2019s distaste for crypto stocks doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you shouldn\u2019t buy Bitcoin. Even the billionaire has come around on sectors he previously spoke out against.\n\nHe notoriously avoided tech stocks, even at the height of the dot-com bubble, and now his company\u2019s largest holding is Apple.\n\nAlternative alternative investments\n\nWith inflation still sitting at a steep 6.4%, many investors these days are aiming to fight inflation outside of the volatile stock market.\n\nBut if Buffett's wariness has put you off crypto, yet you\u2019re still keen to dip into investments outside of traditional stocks, you have options.\n\nHistorically, alternative investments have been the purview of institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. But new platforms are demystifying niche markets and making it easier and cheaper to buy in, especially for non-accredited investors.\n\nThese platforms give retail investors access to a range of private market investments that typically have a low correlation to the stock market, with some requiring a minimum investment of just $500.\n\nThese include luxury vehicle finance, commercial real estate, fine art and even legal finance.\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "title": "The Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Crypto Loans - Blockworks",
        "content": "The rapid adoption of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as an asset class unlocks several opportunities for investors. One such opportunity involves using these digital assets as collateral for loans directly tied to their underlying value.\n\nBitcoin and crypto loans give investors access to cash to meet their immediate needs, all while retaining any potential upside on the cryptocurrencies they hold. However, these loans are not risk-free, as evidenced by the billions of dollars lost by crypto investors in 2022 while lending assets to crypto loan platforms.\n\nThis article demystifies the concept of bitcoin and crypto loans. Readers will learn the benefits and risks of crypto loans, the options available, and answers to frequently asked questions about crypto loans. We first address some common reasons investors may consider getting a crypto loan.\n\nWhy get a crypto loan\n\nA cryptocurrency-backed loan is desirable for several reasons. The most obvious is that it gives investors access to cash without liquidating their cryptocurrency portfolio. Individuals may borrow against their crypto to finance major expenses such as paying off mortgages or buying a car.\n\nOthers may get a cryptocurrency loan to leverage their position and acquire more crypto assets. In a typical example, an investor may use 20% of their crypto portfolio to borrow US dollars and spend the borrowed amount on buying more cryptocurrency.\n\nThe ideal scenario is that the move pays off, upon which the investor can spend realized gains on repaying the initial loan and retaining the rest as profits. However, they may also incur losses if the value of the collateral asset(s) drops substantially during the loan duration.\n\nA crypto loan allows investors to tap into a credit line without spending capital. It becomes unsurprising then that several centralized and decentralized products with crypto loan offerings have attracted a significant user base for these loans.\n\nTypes of crypto loans\n\nCryptocurrency loan products may come in different structures and use diverse models to generate profit for the issuing entity. They may be classified into two broad categories: centralized and decentralized crypto loans.\n\nCentralized finance (CeFi) loans: CeFi loans, as the name suggests, are offered by centralized entities. A significant characteristic is that investors relinquish their collateral ownership by depositing supported assets on the platform. In exchange, they receive a credit line and can borrow money against their capital. A major downside of using a CeFi loan platform is that customers have little visibility into how the lender uses the deposited assets. Users must trust that the platform implements the best security and risk management standards to ensure they can withdraw their capital when they want.\n\nCeFi loans, as the name suggests, are offered by centralized entities. A significant characteristic is that investors relinquish their collateral ownership by depositing supported assets on the platform. In exchange, they receive a credit line and can borrow money against their capital.\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) loans: DeFi loans fundamentally differ from CeFi loans because no third party manages deposited collateral. Instead, the funds are stored in autonomous smart contracts designed to manage operations such as pooling user assets, yield generation and liquidation. DeFi loans are desirable due to their transparency and because the underlying protocols are computer codes that cannot be easily manipulated when built correctly. Loans are also largely overcollateralized, ensuring that there is minimal risk of default. The protocol automatically liquidates users\u2019 positions when they fall below the defined threshold. However, DeFi loan platforms present unique risks. Users must understand and assess these risks before using a bitcoin or crypto loan platform.\n\nDeFi loans fundamentally differ from CeFi loans because no third party manages deposited collateral. Instead, the funds are stored in autonomous smart contracts designed to manage operations such as pooling user assets, yield generation and liquidation.\n\nCrypto loan risks\n\nThe risks associated with crypto loans are diverse. For instance, prospective users may consider the fundamental value of the collateral asset, how the company generates the interest that it pays customers, collateral requirements,and technology risks.\n\nToken risk: The primary risk of taking out a crypto loan is the volatility of most digital assets. The risk becomes more profound if the underlying token has no fundamental value and continues in a downtrend for a relatively long time. An investor using such tokens may face liquidation if negative developments, such as a security exploit or network downtime, lead to a rapid decline in the value of the collateral asset. Bitcoin (BTC) is considered the most secure token, with ether (ETH) being the next best collateral asset. The risk curve becomes significantly greater, with other crypto assets having greater downside potential in the event of a market sell-off.\n\nCounterparty risk: Many crypto loan platforms, especially centralized services, take on significant counterparty risk to generate yield for customers. These companies typically loan customers\u2019 assets to hedge funds, quants and high-volume traders, institutional investors, and in some cases, other everyday investors searching for a crypto-backed credit line. However, the records show that this counterparty exposure risks user funds. The recent collapse of lending platforms such as BlockFi, Celsius, and Genesis reveals that these platforms may rehypothecate user funds. Rehypothecation is where the entity facilitating the loans uses posted collateral for their needs. Additionally, the entire lending system is mostly connected together as the firm may loan assets to its investors or other entities without the requisite collateral. Finding a platform with the least counterparty risk must be a top priority for anyone who wants to take out a loan against crypto. Ideally, platforms that do not offer interest-generating products pose minimal risk. Bitcoin-only lenders that adopt multi-signature or cold storage solutions are also relatively safer as they imbibe the ethos of security and self-custody. Borrowers enjoy more peace of mind knowing funds cannot be rehypothecated by the lender and are not stored by the lender on a third-party exchange where it is still susceptible to such rehypothecation, despite the lender\u2019s claims. Lenders offering low interest rates are more than likely rehypothecating customer funds, so be careful not to choose a loan provider as it\u2019s cheaper.\n\nMany crypto loan platforms, especially centralized services, take on significant counterparty risk to generate yield for customers. These companies typically loan customers\u2019 assets to hedge funds, quants and high-volume traders, institutional investors, and in some cases, other everyday investors searching for a crypto-backed credit line.\n\nTechnical Risk: Crypto lending introduces technical risks, which are mostly not present in traditional banking. The most basic form of risk is the irreversibility of blockchain transactions. In a classic example, the developers of Solana-based DeFi protocol OptiFi mistakenly locked $661k worth of assets while trying to destroy a smart contract. Other technology risk includes private key theft, smart contract exploits and price oracle manipulation. These outcomes are more closely associated with DeFi loan platforms. Nonetheless, centralized lenders are not immune as they actively participate in DeFi to generate revenue.\n\nCrypto lending introduces technical risks, which are mostly not present in traditional banking. The most basic form of risk is the irreversibility of blockchain transactions. In a classic example, the developers of Solana-based DeFi protocol OptiFi mistakenly locked $661k worth of assets while trying to destroy a smart contract.\n\nMargin Call: Investors risk losing their collateral if they fail to manage their position actively, and it falls below an acceptable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Consider an example where an investor deposits $1,000 worth of BTC to borrow $500 at an 80% LTV. This means the user would receive a margin call if their collateral balance drops to around 80% of the borrowed amount. In our example, the user\u2019s collateral will be sold to cover the loan if the collateral\u2019s value drops to $600. Most platforms have clearly stated LTV ratios and would issue a margin call for the user to deposit more assets if their position is at risk of liquidation. The volatile nature of the crypto market means users must respond swiftly to margin calls or lose their collateral. Investors may prioritize using crypto loan platforms that send automated price alerts if the LTV ratio is in danger of being breached. Being financially prepared and able to deposit collateral at any time day or night is also essential.\n\nInvestors risk losing their collateral if they fail to manage their position actively, and it falls below an acceptable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.

In our example, the user\u2019s collateral will be sold to cover the loan if the collateral\u2019s value drops to $600.\n\nRepayment failure risk: Fixed crypto loans include a predetermined repayment schedule for borrowers. Failure to keep up with payments may result in additional charges or collateral liquidation. Flexible loans allow users to repay their loans at any time. Still, users may struggle to repay loans if they incur substantial losses on their investments or face financial challenges in real life. Such outcomes may lead to permanent losses that could be avoided by not having exposure to crypto loans.\n\nFixed crypto loans include a predetermined repayment schedule for borrowers. Failure to keep up with payments may result in additional charges or collateral liquidation.\n\nPros vs. cons\n\nTaking out a loan against crypto collateral presents numerous benefits to investors. At the same time, it may present unique disadvantages that investors must understand before going down that path.\n\nPros\n\nInstant Liquidity: Investors can meet their immediate cash or liquidity demands without losing any potential upside on their crypto investment. This option comes in handy, especially during emergencies or funding large purchases.\n\nLeveraged investment: They can also boost their exposure to a certain asset(s) and thus maximize profits on their portfolio. For example, an investor may spend the borrowed amount to buy more cryptocurrency expecting the market to gain substantially. A positive outcome means more profits, as they can sell a portion of their portfolio to repay the loan.\n\nTax benefits: Investors avoid tax headaches when they choose to borrow against crypto rather than sell it to book profits or losses. In most jurisdictions, such borrows are not considered taxable events, thus allowing investors the option to hold on to their crypto assets for as long as they want.\n\nCons\n\nAbsence of self-custody: Most centralized loan platforms require users to relinquish their assets\u2019 custody. This approach means greater counterparty risks and even the possibility of losing funds permanently if the platform mismanages user funds or files for bankruptcy.\n\nAmplified losses: The volatile nature of the crypto market means users face substantial losses if the decision to purchase more assets using crypto collateral backfires. They could lose most of their collateral and completely miss out on any return on investment.\n\nRegulatory constraints: This disadvantage primarily applies to crypto loans through DeFi protocols. Since such platforms are typically run by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), investors cannot initiate legal proceedings if they lose deposited assets. Similar limitations also face crypto loans initiated with offshore companies operated by obscure entities.\n\nBitcoin-backed loans\n\nBitcoin-backed loans allow users to tap into bitcoin\u2019s collateral value to borrow fiat or stablecoins. This is one of the safest ways for users to obtain a crypto loan since BTC can be less volatile than other crypto assets and offers access to the highest LTV threshold (second only to stablecoins). Many CeFi and DeFi platforms support bitcoin-backed loans. They also tend to implement custody and security practices that align with the ethos of Bitcoin holders. The most Bitcoin-native options are loan products built on layer-2 bitcoin networks such as Liquid or Stacks. Such applications inherently rely on the Bitcoin network for security and offer a degree of self-custodial access to Bitcoiners.\n\nBitcoin-backed loans Examples\n\nVerify 21 \u2013 Verify 21 is a Bitcoin-only centralized lending platform where Bitcoiners can borrow against their BTC without worrying about the risk of rehypothecation.

Readers considering taking a bitcoin loan often find the information contained helpful.\n\nCrypto-backed loans\n\nCryptocurrency-backed loans are hugely popular and involve investors borrowing cash/stablecoins using cryptocurrencies (other than BTC) as collateral. The popularity of crypto-backed loans does not detract from their high-risk nature. Aside from the inherent increased volatility of altcoins, users incur technical and counterparty risks by taking crypto-backed loans.\n\nExamples:\n\nAave \u2013 Aave is the largest decentralized lending protocol in terms of locked value and represents a popular choice within the DeFi ecosystem. Aave is deployed across 11 different networks and offers the same service of letting users borrow against their crypto or earn a yield on deposited assets. The platform supports a wide range of assets and includes its AAVE native token, giving access to rewards earned by the Aave protocol.\n\nNexo \u2013 Nexo is a centralized lending platform that has been live since 2018.

Compound is Ethereum-native, supports a wide range of assets, and features the native COMP token for governance and distribution of protocol rewards.\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I get a crypto loan without collateral?\n\nNo. Most cryptocurrency lending platforms require users to over-collateralize loan positions. This safeguard ensures the platform can easily liquidate user assets in the case of a default. Although newer protocols offer under-collateralized loans, such products are relatively nascent and pose greater risks.\n\nHow much can I borrow in crypto?\n\nThe amount you can borrow in crypto typically depends on the type of collateral asset and the LTV thresholds defined by the loan platform. In most cases, users can borrow up to 90% of stablecoins and up to 50% on BTC and ETH deposits. Users are usually recommended to take only a loan offer representing a smaller portion of their borrowable amount to avoid early liquidation.\n\nAre crypto loans legal?\n\nThere are no publicly-known laws that prohibit investors from accessing crypto-backed loans. Instead, most top-tier crypto lenders actively acquire various regulatory licenses to legalize their operations. Meanwhile, DeFi protocols still operate independently as regulators grapple with the right approach to manage the emerging technology.\n\nHow are crypto loans taxed?\n\nTax laws on crypto loans may differ based on jurisdictions. It is best to consult with a licensed tax advisor for guidance. That said, the law in most regions, including the United States, is that borrowing against crypto is not taxable. Investors only pay taxes when selling cryptocurrencies.\n\nAre crypto loans safe?\n\nCrypto loans are as safe as the lending platform can secure user assets, and the user can maintain a healthy LTV threshold. Users must do their research to find the most reputable platforms and ensure a healthy LTV ratio throughout their loan duration. In most cases, borrowing only up to 20% of deposited collateral and using relatively hard collateral such as bitcoin (BTC) provides a cushion even against severe market declines.\n\nGetting the most out of bitcoin and crypto loans\n\nThe opportunity to take out loans against bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency makes digital assets more appealing. In most cases, users can obtain a loan within minutes \u2013 a level of collateral liquidity not accessible with other asset classes.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin-only loans offer greater security because of the asset\u2019s highly-liquid profile and decentralized network structure. Investors must carefully weigh the risks of crypto-native loans and prioritize the most secure options for their long-term investment portfolio.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

The \u201cSkull of Satoshi,\u201d is a giant sculpture that was created in collaboration with Benjamin Von Wong, to highlight the climate and community impacts of Bitcoin.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, Fidelity has a significant role to play in addressing the urgent climate crisis. To date, the company has pledged to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With its continued support for Bitcoin, a digital currency with a large and growing climate impact, the company is undermining its ability to follow through on its climate promises.\n\nTo learn more about Fidelity Investments\u2019 role in Bitcoin\u2019s climate problem, read Greenpeace USA\u2019s Briefing Paper here: Financial Institutions Need to Support a Code Change to Cleanup Bitcoin\n\nRolf Skar, Greenpeace National Campaigns Director said: \u201cWe have tried to engage Fidelity Investments about addressing Bitcoin\u2019s climate impact but they have demonstrated no interest in even talking, much less taking action. That is why we are here. Bitcoin mining requires vast amounts of electricity, contributing to carbon emissions, harming communities, and exacerbating the climate crisis. But this growing problem can be fixed if companies like Fidelity step up to develop solutions that work for people, the climate, and Bitcoin\u2019s future in a warming world.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace USA is urging Fidelity to join the solution by encouraging Bitcoin to change its code to help mitigate the climate impact. Bitcoin\u2019s code relies on a process called Proof of Work to validate transactions on its digital ledger or blockchain which consumes massive amounts of electricity from fossil fuels. Globally, its largest single source of electricity is coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe action comes as part of an ongoing campaign to hold corporations accountable for their role in contributing to the climate crisis through investments in Bitcoin. Greenpeace USA is calling on companies to prioritize climate commitments and to pressure Bitcoin to come up with creative solutions to address its energy intensive code.\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Greenpeace USA Senior Communications Specialist, [email protected], 631-404-9977\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future. Greenpeace USA is committed to transforming the country\u2019s unjust social, environmental, and economic systems from the ground up to address the climate crisis, advance racial justice, and build an economy that puts people first.

A \u201ccaptain\u201d called the man back and said he was considered non-compliant, and the repercussions would be much greater. HCSO said he converted the money to Bitcoin, but before sending the code, listened to my gut and drove to the courthouse. It was there, he learned this was a scam.\n\nChief Deputy Tom Fox says calls like this are more than likely fake as the Sheriff\u2019s Office does not call people regarding jury duty.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t call people and ask for money. We don\u2019t call people and tell people we\u2019re going to arrest them, we knock on their doors if we\u2019re going to arrest somebody. But you do not get arrested for failure to appear for jury duty. That has to go through a court process and a judge will summon you to court,\u201d said Fox.\n\nStay with WMBF News for updates.\n\nCopyright 2023 WMBF. All rights reserved."

When you look at the inception of this ETF, it\u2019s actually down 75%,\u201d Lydon said. \u201cHowever, if you look at year to date, this ETF and Bitcoin itself is up almost 70% off of the recent lows, so it\u2019s encouraging.\u201d\n\nLydon said bitcoin has demonstrated it\u2019s not going away, earnings a role as its own asset class and something worth paying attention to. As the fund moves above its 200-day moving average, it\u2019s worth consideration.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at trends, and you look at alternatives to what\u2019s going on in the equity markets, the fixed income markets, currencies, banking, there\u2019s also an opportunity to diversify and have non correlated assets as well,\u201d Lydon said. \u201cSo with all that in mind, having an ETF regardless of what it covers, or regardless what its name is, if it goes above its [moving]average, this is something to consider for your portfolio.\u201d\n\nBITO notably does not offer exposure to spot bitcoin but rather bitcoin futures, as the SEC has not approved spot bitcoin or cryptocurrency ETFs. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler approved a futures-based strategy as the CFTC futures are regulated, enhancing the products reception with regulators.\n\n\u201cAnd guess what? it\u2019s worked,\u201d Lydon said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s been down this much, it has been exactly correlated with the performance of Bitcoin \u2014 and that\u2019s what everybody wanted.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lydon, the idea here is that, with BITO and bitcoin going above its 20-day moving average, investors have the opportunity to buy in low with the ability to protect themselves if it turns around and dips below its trendline."

        "content": "Bitcoin rebounded in Wednesday morning trading in Asia after a slide earlier in the week when U.S. regulators filed a lawsuit against Binance, the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchange. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies gained ground. XRP continued to lead the winners, while Cardano followed. U.S. equities moved lower on Tuesday on broader worries about interest rates and the economy and as regulators proposed stricter rules on the U.S. banking industry.\n\nSee related article: Asia leads crypto regulations, innovation may leave the US, says Ripple\u2019s Long\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin edged up 1.29% to US$27,290 in the 24 hours to 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, posting a weekly loss of 2.76%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The leading cryptocurrency see-sawed so far this week after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Binance for alleged violation of trading rules. Bitcoin dropped from around US$28,000 to a low of US$26,677 on Tuesday, and bounced back above the US$27,000 mark early Wednesday.\n\nEthereum also regained ground, rising 4.09% to US$1,776, but still down 0.78% for the past seven days.\n\nXRP continued to lead the winners, jumping 10.04% to US$0.5215 for a rise of 12.92% over the seven days. The token continues to gain on expectations that Ripple Labs, whose crypto payment network is powered by XRP, may win a favorable ruling in a lawsuit filed against the company by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC charged Ripple with selling an unregistered security in the form of XRP.\n\n\u201cThe implications for the case are very broad-reaching for the crypto industry because we expect that this decision will ultimately set a precedent for how the U.S. government will look at categorizing crypto assets and regulating them,\u201d Ripple Labs President Monica Long told Forkast.News on Tuesday.\n\nCardano posted the second largest gain among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, jumping 6.68% to US$0.3678, but is still down 1.06% for the week.\n\nAdding to regulatory tensions, a U.S. judge ordered a hold on Binance\u2019s US$1.3 billion acquisition of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital, as requested by the Department of Justice that appealed an earlier court ruling to approve the sale.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 1.80% in the past 24 hours to US$1.15 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours dropped 6.00% to US$39.94 billion.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.34% in the past 24 hours to 4,006.47 as of 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving down 3.26% for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by Forkast sister company, CryptoSlam.\n\nU.S. equities closed lower on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.12%, the S&P 500 edged down 0.16%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.45%.\n\nThe U.S. Congress held a hearing Tuesday on recent bank failures where regulators assured deposits in U.S. banks were safe, but said tighter regulations are required on the banking industry. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday he was confident the problems in the banking system were being resolved, but his administration would offer additional support as needed.\n\nThe U.S. consumer confidence index rose slightly in March, the Conference Board reported on Tuesday, suggesting more optimism in the economy than thought as the expectation was for a decline.\n\nOn inflation, analysts at the CME Group expect a 57.5% chance the Fed will keep rates between 4.75% to 5% at its next meeting on May 3. The chance of another 25 basis-point hike is at 42.5%, up from 41.7% on Tuesday.\n\nU.S. stock futures moved up as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged 0.27% higher, S&P 500 futures rose 0.34% and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.36%. Investors are now waiting for the data about U.S. pending home sales in February, where experts expect a 3% decline from the previous month, according to CNBC on Tuesday.\n\nSee related article: Bankman-Fried charged with paying millions in bribes to Chinese government officials"

        "content": "The Justices of the Supreme Court of Denmark have handed down two judgements on whether the sale of Bitcoin (BTC) under certain circumstances qualifies as a taxable event.\n\nIn a March 30 notice, Denmark\u2019s Supreme Court said a party who gained profits from selling Bitcoin acquired through several purchases and donations was required to report the sale as a taxable event, adding the purchase was \u201cmade for the purpose of speculation.\u201d In a separate case, the court ruled a user who mined their own BTC and later sold the coins would be subject to the same tax consideration.\n\nBoth cases considered by the supreme court involved the acquisition of BTC between 2011 and 2013, with sales between 2017 and 2018, suggesting a price difference in the thousands of dollars. The court cited sections of the country\u2019s National Tax Act, noting it had considered the first seller\u2019s intent to eventually sell the coins based on a post in a 2011 Bitcoin forum.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court finds that the received Bitcoins must be considered assets acquired with a view to later turnover as an integrated part of [the first party]\u2019s business with the development and operation of software for Bitcoins,\u201d said the ruling. \u201cThey cannot be considered at the time of sale to have been transferred to be [their] private property or assets. On that basis, the Supreme Court finds that the relinquishment of the Bitcoins received constituted revenue in [their] non-commercial business. Sales therefore trigger tax liability.\u201d\n\nRelated: What is crypto tax-loss harvesting, and how does it work?\n\nCoincub reported in September 2022 that gains earned from crypto in Denmark could incur a tax rate of roughly 37% but also up to 52% depending on whether the user has a high income. This would place the country well above crypto tax rates in the United States subject to its capital gains laws \u2014 between 0% and 37% depending on whether the taxpayer sells assets held for more or less than a year and their income bracket.\n\nMagazine: Best and worst countries for crypto taxes \u2014 Plus crypto tax tips"

        "content": "The growing hype surrounding Ordinals has established Bitcoin as an emerging frontier for trading digital collectibles. And as the landscape develops, the Solana-based NFT marketplace Magic Eden has quickly emerged as a new leader.\n\nOrdinals\u2014a protocol that enables content like art and text to be inscribed on individual satoshis, the smallest unit of measure that Bitcoin can be divided into\u2014has exploded in popularity since it was introduced in January as traders and developers grow more familiar with NFT-like assets called inscriptions.\n\nMagic Eden opened the door to trading inscriptions just over a week ago, on March 21, and has grown to represent a majority of Ordinals trading volume across various marketplaces that support them as of yesterday, according to a Dune dashboard created by a pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast named Domo.\n\nOrdinals marketplaces have now seen: - $15.65m volume\n\n- 38.3k trades\n\n- 18.46k users Several players are now established in the space - including @OrdinalsMarket_, @ordswap, @MagicEden & others Killer dash by @domodata \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0fhttps://t.co/R0yfck13GO \u2014 Dune (@DuneAnalytics) March 30, 2023\n\nOn Tuesday, Magic Eden racked up roughly $170,000 worth of inscription sales compared to around $72,000 on the second most popular marketplace, Ordinals Wallet.\n\nBTC DeGods, a collection of inscriptions released by the creators of the most valuable Solana NFT profile picture (PFP) project, has played an influential role in Magic Eden\u2019s ascension to the top, Domo told Decrypt via Twitter message.\n\nStory continues\n\n'Bitcoin Is the Best Brand in Crypto': Why DeGods NFTs Are Now on Bitcoin\n\nThe Bitcoin-based collection of profile pictures has notched nearly 35 BTC, or almost $1 million worth of total trading volume since it was released, with the cheapest inscription hovering around $23,000 worth of BTC as of this writing, according to Magic Eden.\n\nMagic Eden still lags behind Ordinals Wallet in terms of total daily transactions, although the trend over the past week suggests that Magic Eden is chipping away at that lead. Yesterday, 404 inscriptions were traded on Magic Eden while Ordinals Wallet facilitated 543 sales, according to Domo\u2019s dashboard.\n\nIn other words, Magic Eden is handling higher-value Ordinals sales. And the long-standing link between DeGods and Magic Eden on Solana\u2014even though DeGods is about to migrate from Solana to Ethereum\u2014may be translating over to Bitcoin as traders flock to the well-known marketplace\u2019s latest incarnation.\n\nWhen Magic Eden launched in 2021, it started out as a marketplace that solely supported NFTs created on Solana. But over time, the marketplace has added support for NFTs on other blockchains such as Ethereum and Polygon, the latter an Ethereum scaling network.\n\nWe built our Bitcoin marketplace in a month. To take it across the finish line, we rented a giant Airbnb in California and brought over a dozen devs together. As a mostly remote company, we're proud to share some of our faces and tell our story.\n\nBIG thank you to @bhammers for\u2026 pic.twitter.com/3Pu5zzXZ1u \u2014 Magic Eden \ud83e\ude84 (@MagicEden) March 22, 2023\n\n\"We hope to continue to see both creator and user growth on Ordinals,\" Magic Eden Head of Marketing Tiffany Huang told Decrypt. \"A lot of creators I talk to are definitely interested and exploring it, especially after knowing high-value names like Yuga and DeGods are involved.\"\n\nFor a user base that\u2019s already familiar with trading collectibles across multiple networks, Magic Eden traders' swift embrace of inscriptions on Bitcoin makes sense, according to Domo.\n\n\u201cTheir user base is typically open to being multi-chain, so the prospect of a new chain isn\u2019t daunting to them,\u201d Domo told Decrypt.\n\nMagic Eden Launches Ordinals Marketplace for Bitcoin NFTs\n\nMagic Eden\u2019s ability to corner the market for inscriptions quickly is also a function of its status as an established marketplace, compared to other trading venues that have cropped up only recently and are limited to Bitcoin, Domo added.\n\nAt the same time, Magic Eden is only the first among mainstream marketplaces to support inscriptions. And as Magic Eden has itself experienced in the past on Solana, even upstart rivals can quickly eat away at market dominance. But for now, at least, Magic Eden is commanding the most Ordinals trading volume."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining stocks had a dull performance in March, with small moves here and there that followed BTC's price movement. While it is encouraging to see that most stocks held onto their impressive January gains, Bitcoin's price action will be crucial for the short-to-medium-term performance of these stocks.\n\nAdditionally, the expansion of the public Bitcoin mining sector in the U.S. continues as American miners reported one of the biggest ASIC imports in January 2023. The delivery of new machines and an increase in the Bitcoin (BTC) price led to a surge in the network\u2019s hash rate to new all-time highs. Miners\u2019 incomes, however, were subdued by the rising network difficulty.\n\nMining stocks are in wait-and-see mode\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s recent 18% rally, subdued performances of most mining stocks can be attributed to the uncertainty around the sustainability of Bitcoin\u2019s price rally and the increasing competition in the mining industry. The Hashrate Index, a proxy for Bitcoin mining stocks, increased 10% in March, going from 1,929 to 2,141 points.\n\nThe median monthly gain in the top ten mining stocks is 0.30%, with an average of 5.21%. Riot Platforms and Cipher Mining led the monthly gains across the sector with a 28.64% and 24.34% rise. CleanSpark, Inc. and Bitfarms Ltd. were the worst performers, with negative 6.52% and 5.79% moves.\n\nThe performance of the top ten Bitcoin mining stocks as of March 28.\n\nThe average Q1 2023 gains across the top ten Bitcoin mining stocks is 128%. These shares yielded the majority of their Q1 2023 gains in January. The following months, February and March, saw a muted performance from most mining company stocks.\n\nThe chart of Marathon Digital\u2019s stock perfectly illustrates the price action across the industry, with a tall candle in January, followed by small moves in the next couple of months.\n\nMARA/USD monthly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nCurrently, mining firms are focused on expanding and sustaining their operations rather than profits. Marathon Digital increased its mining capacity by 30% in February. The firm\u2019s aggressive expansion will increase its production capacity from 9.5 EH/s to 23 EH/s by mid-2023.\n\nAt the same time, Canadian mining firm Hut 8 Mining Corporations announced a merger with the U.S.-based Bitcoin Corp to combine their resources and weather the downturn across the industry.\n\nThe network\u2019s hash rate soared as new ASICs flood the market\n\nThe Bitcoin network\u2019s hash rate increased to an all-time high of 348 exahash per second (EH/s) from 320 EH/s in the last week of March.\n\nThe revenue of miners jumped around 30% after the recent rise in BTC price, increasing from $65 per petahash per sec (PH/s) per day in Q4 2022 to around $85 per PH/s per day in Q1 2023. However, Bitcoin\u2019s price jumped over 60% during the same period.\n\nThe increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price is only part of the reason behind the hash rate surge. The discrepancy in miner incomes can be attributed to the increasing mining difficulty. It was mainly due to the delivery of new machines across America, which increased the network\u2019s processing power and difficulty.\n\nIn January, U.S. miners reportedly imported 1,555 tons of machines, which has propelled the network\u2019s hashrate to its current peak.\n\nRelated: Crypto mining in 2023 \u2014 Is it still worth it? Watch Market Talks\n\nBitcoin monthly estimate of miner shipments and the network\u2019s hashrate. Source: TheMinerMag\n\nThe rise in the network\u2019s hash rate has limited the revenue of miners, which may adversely affect miners\u2019 incomes if BTC prices were to fall from here.\n\nThere\u2019s a probability that the network\u2019s hashrate could plateau around current levels. The MinerMag report added:\n\n\"If there\u2019s no major uptick in the shipment gross weight in the rest of March and into April, the growth rate of bitcoin\u2019s network hashrate may gradually slow down.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price performance will continue to play a significant role in the growth of the mining sector, but BTC price must sustain its current level or move higher for positive revenues and a continued uptrend in public stocks.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Regulation continues to be the primary concern for Bitcoin bulls, especially after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance for trading and derivatives law violations. The regulator wants Binance to repay the trading profits, revenues, salaries, commissions, loans and fees it received from United States citizens, as well as paying civil penalties for the violations.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) rise was also fueled by a shift in sentiment toward risk assets after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said interest rate hikes are no longer the default move to curb inflation. The central bank understood that the current situation will likely \u201cresult in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes.\u201d\n\nFixed-income investors earn more when interest rates rise, so buying stocks and commodities becomes less appealing. As a result, by reversing the strategy and adding $339 billion in liabilities in two weeks, the Fed chose to contain the banking crisis, which may cause inflation to spiral out of control.\n\nGiven the accretive scenario for risk assets, Bitcoin bulls can profit up to $1.4 billion in Friday's monthly options expiry.\n\nBitcoin bears were caught completely off-guard\n\nThe open interest for the March 31 options expiry is $4.2 billion, but the actual figure will be lower since bears were expecting sub-$26,500 price levels. These traders were caught by surprise as Bitcoin gained 32% between March 12 and March 17.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for March 31. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 1.34 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $2.4 billion call (buy) open interest and the $1.8 billion put (sell) options. However, if Bitcoin's price remains near $28,000 at 8:00 am UTC on March 31, only $25 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to sell Bitcoin at $26,000 or $27,000 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\nBulls aim for $29,000 to secure a record-breaking $1.4 billion profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on March 31 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $25,000 and $26,000: 27,200 calls vs. 12,700 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $360 million.\n\n27,200 calls vs. 12,700 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $360 million. Between $26,000 and $27,000: 32,300 calls vs. 8,500 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $620 million.\n\n32,300 calls vs. 8,500 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $620 million. Between $27,000 and $28,000: 38,100 calls vs. 3,000 puts. Bulls increase their advantage to $1.2 billion.\n\n38,100 calls vs. 3,000 puts. Bulls increase their advantage to $1.2 billion. Between $28,000 and $30,000: 48,300 calls vs. 400 puts. Bulls dominate by profiting $1.4 billion.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor example, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price, but unfortunately, there's no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nRelated: \u2018Definitely not bullish\u2019 \u2014 7% Bitcoin price gains fail to convince traders\n\nThe bears best hope relies on regulatory FUD\n\nBitcoin bulls must push the price above $29,000 by March 31 to secure a potential $1.4 billion profit. Bear's best shot, on the other hand, is more regulatory FUD about stablecoins or major crypto exchanges \u2014 which has so far been fruitless.\n\nConsidering the bullish momentum created by the Fed's inability to continue raising interest rates, bulls are well positioned for the March BTC monthly options expiry. Most likely, those profits will be used to further strengthen the $28,000 support, so the expected outcome is especially concerning for bears.\n\nBitcoin has been hovering around $28,000 for the past ten days, but the cryptocurrency has gained 70.5% year to date. Until March 17, Bitcoin was trading below $25,000 and this explains why most bearish bets for March\u2019s $4.2 billion options expiry were placed at $26,500 or lower.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Stabolut Launches New Bitcoin-backed, Decentralized Stablecoin, USDB - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Introducing a dollar-pegged, Bitcoin backed stablecoin, built without dependencies on banks. Becoming available on a private beta starting today, USDB, a stablecoin that has been built in a revolutionary approach that will reroute the crypto markets unlocking new opportunities for fast and simple trades to power exchanges, financial institutions, businesses, developers, and users.\n\nHONG KONG, March 29, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stabolut, a startup that is building a completely new worldwide payments ecosystem and the issuer of the USDB, today announced that it has just launched a fully decentralized, dollar-pegged stablecoin called USDB. Available as of today, March 29th, 2023, USDB is a stablecoin issued under a groundbreaking model that\u2019s built on decentralized pillars of trustless infrastructure and security that have made Bitcoin the world\u2019s most trusted and reliable cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\n\nUSDB enters a very hot market, as stablecoins total 140 billion in capitalization, which is currently expected to grow to at least 1 trillion. Simultaneously, opinion leaders in crypto have been asking for a truly decentralized and privacy preserving stablecoin that everyone in the industry can trust, set up with verified and audited assets and invulnerable to shut downs.\n\n\u201cStabolut is setting the new industry leading standards for moving financial value across the internet and crypto markets with USDB,\u201d said Eneko Knorr, co-founder and CEO of Stabolut. \u201cThere\u2019s clear market demand from users for a reliable stablecoin choice, given the collapse of UST -Terra Luna\u2019s stablecoin-, as well as witnessing the recent instability caused by the de-pegging of USDC following the recent bank failures we\u2019ve seen this year. With USDB, Stabolut is helping to unlock a new era of transparent privacy-preserving, fast, inexpensive, secure and interoperable exchange across the globe.\u201d said Julian Beltran, co-founder and CTO of Stabolut.\n\nFor a truly decentralized economy, a decentralized currency is essential. In May 2022, Stabolut embarked on the development of USDB, a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin designed to reflect the value of the US Dollar through an innovative method: shorting Bitcoin via a Bitcoin inverse perpetual swap. Asset-backed USDB eliminates the need for bank accounts, ensuring immunity from crackdowns or frozen funds, and bolstering complete privacy and resilience. Fiat-backed stablecoins face centralization and regulatory hurdles, limiting access and innovation while increasing counterparty risk and reducing user privacy. USDB\u2019s approach aligns with Bitmex co-founder Arthur Hayes' Nakadollar (NUSD) concept.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOur solution addresses the limitations of fiat-backed stablecoins, which suffer from centralization and regulatory challenges. By mitigating counterparty risks and enhancing user privacy, we aim to expand accessibility and foster innovation in the stablecoin market.\u201d said Eneko Knorr.\n\nUSDB will power cross chain transactions and inter-chain exports across all the ecosystems and beyond, providing users and exchanges with a global stablecoin where they can take their power back from the western financial system and interact with their money on their own terms no matter where or who they are. USDB will work broadly with Bitcoin compatible wallets, protocols, and other blockchain services.\n\nTo learn more about the USDB stablecoin, visit the Stabolut website.\n\nAbout Stabolut:\n\nStabolut is a company that is building a complete ecosystem for payments around the globe. Started by serial entrepreneurs with a broad experience in tech and crypto, Stabolut is the issuer of the USDB stablecoin, a digital currency that is poised to solve all the issues and concerns other stablecoins have, with a clear goal to become one of the most widely used stablecoins. Stabolut received funding from the co-founders of Dextools.io, an ecosystem with 30 million monthly visits that allows traders to track information about all the decentralized markets.

        "title": "Mysterious entity may be collecting BTC users' IP addresses \u2014 Bitcoin developer - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "An unknown person or group may be collecting the IP addresses of Bitcoin (BTC) users and linking them to their BTC addresses, violating the privacy of these users, according to a blog post from pseudonymous Bitcoin app developer 0xB10C. The entity has been active since March 2018, and its IP addresses have shown up on several public posts from Bitcoin node operators over the past several years.\n\n0xB10C is the developer of several Bitcoin analytics websites, including Mempool.observer and Transactionfee.info. They have also been awarded a Bitcoin developer grant from Brink.dev in the past.\n\nAn entity I call LinkingLion, active since 2018 and on a Monero banlist, is opening connections to many clearnet Bitcoin nodes. Its presumably attempting to link transactions to node IPs. Maybe a chain analysis company trying to enhance its product?https://t.co/W4PDoln3p3 \u2014 0xB10C (@0xB10C) March 28, 2023\n\n0xB10C calls the entity \u201cLinkingLion\u201d because the IP addresses associated with it pass through LionLink network\u2019s colocation data center. However, ARIN and RIPE registry information reveal that this company is probably not the originator of the messages, according to 0xB10C.\n\nThe entity uses a range of 812 different IP addresses to open connections with Bitcoin full nodes that are visible on the network (also called \u201clistening nodes\u201d). Once it opens a connection, the entity asks the node which version of the Bitcoin software it is using. However, when the node responds with a version number and message stating that it has understood the request, the entity closes its connection about 85% of the time without responding.\n\nAccording to the post, this behavior may indicate that the entity is trying to determine if a particular node can be reached at a particular IP address.\n\nWhile this behavior isn\u2019t necessarily a cause for concern, it\u2019s what the entity does the other 15% of the time that may be a concern. 0xB10C stated that about 15% of the time, LinkingLion doesn\u2019t close the connection immediately. Instead, they either listen for inventory messages that contain transactions or send a request for an address and listen for both inventory and address messages. They then close the connection within 10 minutes.\n\nThis behavior would normally indicate that the user is a node trying to update its copy of the blockchain. However, LinkingLion never requests blocks or transactions, which implies that they must be pursuing some other purpose, the post said.\n\nRelated: Zero-knowledge proofs are coming to Bitcoin\n\n0xB10C stated that LinkingLion might be recording the timing of transactions to determine which node first received a transaction, information that can then be used to determine the IP address associated with a particular Bitcoin address. The developer explained:\n\n\u201cConnections that complete the version handshake and stay connected learn about our node\u2019s inventory, like transactions and blocks. The timing information, i.e., when a node announces its new inventory, is especially relevant. The entity is likely to first learns about our new wallet transaction from us. As the entity is connected to many listening nodes, it can use that information to link broadcast transactions to IP addresses.\u201d\n\nTo help protect the community from this privacy threat, 0xB10C has produced an open-source ban list that nodes can implement to ban LinkingLion from connecting to them. However, they also warned that the entity could get around this ban list by changing the IP addresses it uses to connect. In 0xB10C\u2019s view, the only permanent solution to the problem is to change the transaction logic within Bitcoin Core, which developers have so far been unable to do.\n\nIn a conversation with Cointelegraph, 0xB10C stated that the vulnerability doesn't just affect users who run their own nodes. Even users who rely on a third-party server through a wallet like Electrum or Mycelium can still be victims of this invasion of privacy.\n\n\"When using Electrum wallet, you connect to a remote Electrum server. You tell the server which addresses you are interested in and, when you send a transaction, you tell the server about the transaction. This is all linked to your IP address if you don't use Tor or similar,\" they said. \"All LinkingLion has to do is to run public Electrum servers and get people to connect to it. This has been suspected to be happening for years and it has been recommended to run your Electrum server connected to your own node.\"\n\nPrivacy has been a continuing concern for Bitcoin and crypto users over the years. Although Bitcoin addresses are pseudonymous, their transaction histories are entirely public. Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonopoulos has argued that Bitcoin will never be truly private. But Breeze Wallet has attempted to improve privacy on the network by utilizing offchain transactions and cryptographic puzzles.\n\nThis article was updated on March 30 with a comment from 0xB10C regarding users who don't run their own nodes."

It should be noted that this was just one more step in the regulatory process, and the bill is far from passed yet.\u201d\n\nMurphy added that he was also looking for more clarity on whether cryptocurrency transaction limits only apply to commercial transactions and not to transfers between private individuals.\n\nGiven that Wachsman serves a number of cryptocurrency service providers as a communications firm, Murphy noted industry participants are becoming more cognizant that the sector could use regulation to meet its full potential.\n\n\u201cInnovation is unpredictable by its very nature. We are experiencing a digital revolution, and there is a real danger of both overregulation and underregulation.\u201d\n\nErwin Voloder, senior policy fellow at the European Blockchain Association, also spoke to Cointelegraph about the European Parliament\u2019s draft bill\u2019s implications for cryptocurrency payments.\n\nHe highlighted that greater clarity over AML/CTF provisions is welcome but contended that a double standard is constantly applied to crypto payments.\n\nVoloder said that MEPs had previously back-peddled on the need to go through a CASP for the KYC process under Article 59a due to being unnecessarily onerous, according to industry feedback:\n\n\u201cThe caps on crypto transactions make the case that crypto transactions are 7x as risky as cash transactions from an AML/CTF perspective, which in comparison to the available data on global money laundering does not line up.\u201d\n\nWhat also remains difficult to gauge is how cryptocurrency services like decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and even decentralized autonomous organizations will be governed by potential new laws.\n\n\u201cMiCA left \u2018fully decentralized finance\u2019 out of scope because it\u2019s often difficult to determine a chain of liability.\u201d\n\nVoloder used an example considering that a DeFi platform may have an interface that is \u201cclient-facing,\u201d but the actual economic activity takes place within the smart contract, which \u201cis abstracted and independent from the interface layer.\u201d\n\nThis suggests that there is a strategy forming at the margins of the industry that could bring liability and default reporting obligations to the DeFi space, including nonfungible tokens.\n\nThe AML-focused legislation brings crypto under its purview to tighten up commercial transactions across Europe. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency space is shining a broad spotlight on the recent failings of the traditional banking sector. What remains to be answered is which industry needs more oversight at this moment in time.\n\nMagazine: 4 out of 10 NFT sales are fake: Learn to spot the signs of wash trading"

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price is on the verge of bursting through a multi-month barrier at $28,567 but is repeatedly failing to breach it.\n\nInstitutional interest has risen significantly recently, albeit in favor of BTC and not altcoins.\n\nWhile the flow of capital may suggest an alt season incoming, Bitcoin large wallet holders are preparing for another quarter of gains.\n\nOver the last few months, Bitcoin price has emerged as one of the best-performing assets in the entire crypto market, leaving behind Ethereum, other altcoins and even meme coins. The rally registered on the charts is making investors susceptible as to whether BTC will continue rising or if this is the end of the line.\n\nBitcoin price to dominate the possibility of an alt season\n\nBitcoin price trading at $27,800 is very close to pushing beyond the $30,000 mark. The growth observed in the first quarter of the year neutralized the possibility of altcoins taking over the market. And if the same is observed over the next quarter, an alt season may have to wait longer.\n\nAn alt season is the period of time when altcoins perform and return better than Bitcoin does. Usually, an alt season occurs when the top 50 cryptocurrencies have better growth than Bitcoin in a 90-day period. Generally, an alt season comes after the biggest cryptocurrency in the world rallies as the capital gained in this period flows into altcoins.\n\nAlt Season indicator\n\nHowever, looking at the indicators, this may not be the case for now. This is because two of the most important cohorts of investors are favoring Bitcoin price rise at the moment. Bitcoin large wallet holders and institutional investors have been stacking up and investing in BTC over the last few weeks, lifting expectations of a rally.\n\nBitcoin whale holdings\n\nThe addresses holding 10 to 10,000 BTC have been growing over Q1, with some decline observed in the addresses holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC.\n\nFurthermore, institutional investors have also redirected their funds over the last week, with Bitcoin receiving the larger chunk of them. The week ending March 24 observed $127.5 million flowing into BTC, the highest since July 2022.\n\nBitcoin institutional inflows\n\nHence, the market is still in a Bitcoin season and will continue unless BTC fails to breach the critical resistance at $28,567, which has been the case for two weeks now. Flipping it into support would push Bitcoin price towards reclaiming $30,000.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart\n\nHowever, failing a breach would bring the price back down to the critical support level of $24,943. Losing it would lead to Bitcoin price touching the lows of $22,000 to $20,000."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nTexas-based Bitcoin mining companies may soon be without the financial incentives that have let the industry gain a strong competitive advantage in the Lone Star State.\n\nIntroduced earlier this month, Senate Bill 1751 seeks to protect the state\u2019s electric grid during peak loads, with one proposed measure being the utility-scale.\n\nA key provision of the bill is that it would restrict Bitcoin mining companies from participating in a state-run demand response program. This program rewards miners for giving power back to the grid when demand threatens to overwhelm the system unless the anticipated demand for electricity \u201cis less than 10 percent of the total load required by all loads in the program,\u201d the bill reads.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bill would also bar \"virtual currency mining from tax abatements given that the large scale of growth in virtual currency mining is already projected to occur in the state,\u201d said the bill\u2019s sponsor Senator Lois Kolkhorst during Tuesday's testimony, adding that there\u2019s no need to subsidize that growth.\n\nThe Texas senator insisted that the bill is not a \u201cpunitive\u201d one, but rather \u201crightsizes for the industry\u201d that doesn\u2019t need that kind of assistance.\n\nSharing portions of his speech made during the same testimony with Decrypt, U.S. Blockchain Corp.'s chief commercial officer Matt Prusak said that his firm understands \"that the goal of SB1751 is to ensure the responsible growth of the bitcoin mining industry in Texas. While we share this goal, we believe that the current proposal may have unintended consequences that could negatively impact both the mining sector and the broader energy market.\"\n\nRiot Blockchain, one of the largest Texas-based Bitcoin mining companies that recently rebranded to Riot Platforms, has been a large beneficiary of the current incentives in Texas. Last Summer, it earned as much as $9.5 million in power credits after suspending operations during the heatwave.\n\nRiot\u2019s Rockdale Bitcoin mining facility, which is believed to be one of the largest in North America, has a total power capacity of 750 MW. The firm has also kicked off development for a large-scale 1 gigawatt (GW) development to expand its Bitcoin mining and hosting capabilities in Navarro County, with the initial 400 MW of capacity expected to begin in July 2023.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin miners' electricity use grows\n\nAccording to a recent Reuters report citing the Texas Blockchain Council president Lee Bratcher, Texas-based Bitcoin miners currently consume about 2,100 megawatts of the state's power supplies, up 75% over the last year.\n\nMoreover, the latest power usage metric was almost triple that of the prior year, said Bratcher.\n\nData by ERCOT also shows that the Texas Bitcoin mining industry\u2019s power demand accounts for nearly 3.7% of the state\u2019s lowest forecast peak load this year.\n\nThose opposing the bill and taking part in the testimony included the Texas Blockchain Council president Lee Bratcher and the organization\u2019s director of Business Development Kristine Cranley, as well as Riot\u2019s VP Pierre Rochard.\n\nIn Austin today testifying in the Senate Business and Commerce Committee to ensure Texas remains a place for innovation, business expansion and prosperity!

        "title": "Africa: The next hub for Bitcoin, crypto adoption and venture capital? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency space has no shortage of skeptics. While many people criticize the environmental impact of proof-of-work blockchains or the proliferation of scams, one particular argument against crypto often stands out: Blockchain has no real use cases.\n\nEvery two weeks, Cointelegraph\u2019s The Agenda podcast breaks down this critique and explores the various ways blockchain and crypto can help everyday people.\n\nOn this week\u2019s episode of The Agenda, hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond chat with Elisha Owusu Akyaw, Cointelegraph\u2019s own social media specialist and host of the Hashing It Out podcast, to break down how Africans are using crypto to strengthen financial inclusivity and potentially turn countries into hubs of technological innovation.\n\nHow crypto is helping everyday Africans\n\nAccording to Akyaw, crypto offers a more convenient, affordable way to send money both regionally and around the world. \u201cWestern Union, MoneyGram and all of these money transaction firms or rails have made millions from Africa for so long\u201d by charging high fees, said Akyaw, whereas the cost required to send money via crypto is significantly lower.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) also offers a better store of value for most Africans than local fiat currencies, Akyaw argued. Speaking on his own experience of living in Ghana, he said that \u201cyou can buy Bitcoin and keep it for the next one year or six months. It\u2019s a better hedge against inflation than keeping the Ghanaian cedi.\u201d\n\nFinally, the crypto industry is opening up new opportunities on the continent. \u201cAt every point of development, Africa has been left behind,\u201d said Akyaw. But the global nature of the industry and the fact that it\u2019s still in its early development present a unique opportunity to participate and benefit from its growth.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the first times where there is a big shift happening and Africans are able to contribute. Africans are able to benefit directly from the shift that is happening without it having to pass through an intermediary, which is usually the state. And I think it\u2019s an amazing thing.\u201d\n\nThe next Silicon Valley?\n\nWhen asked about what it would take for countries in Africa to become \u201cmagnets for crypto builders or a new kind of Silicon Valley,\u201d Akyaw pointed to two factors that need to be improved for developers, startups and fintech companies to want to make the continent their home: regulation and infrastructure.\n\nUmm. So I met @jack at the @AfroBitcoinOrg Conference.\n\n\n\nI have been smiling since pic.twitter.com/SJKjkU6nAb \u2014 Elisha | GhCryptoGuy (@ghcryptoguy) December 5, 2022\n\nThe majority of African countries lack proper regulation, according to Akyaw, while also condemning the use of crypto. This means companies are often unable to obtain licenses to set up shop and residents are dissuaded from interacting with Web3 protocols and firms:\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get a license. You can\u2019t work with a bank in the country. You can\u2019t do a lot of things. So, it makes no sense for you to come in.\u201d\n\nThe other thing that needs to change, said Akyaw, is that electric grids need to be more stable and internet needs to be more reliable. \u201cIf you want a lot of Big Tech companies to come in, they must have great, 24/7 electricity. Internet must be awesome because a lot of what we do in the crypto space is virtual.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Akyaw\u2019s conversation with The Agenda \u2014 including his backstory, whether outside funding has any negatives and the potential near-term future of crypto in Africa \u2014 listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph\u2019s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

The U.S. payments giant will now serve as the exclusive network partner for Fold's prepaid debit products in North America, Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean, Fold said Thursday.\n\nThe bitcoin-friendly shopping app Fold first partnered with Visa in 2020 to issue a debit card offering bitcoin (BTC) rewards instead of traditional reward points, similar to the reward levels you'd expect from a credit card. Fold along with several other companies, including Coinbase (COIN), provide Visa cards that offer bitcoin rewards.\n\nUsers have been rewarded over $30 million in bitcoin since the debit card launch but the expanded collaboration comes at a time when the \"demand for bitcoin onramps outside the U.S is growing,\" said Will Reeves, CEO of Fold. Under the new arrangement, Fold and Visa will enter new regions. Plans include empowering existing local financial service companies to launch their own bitcoin rewards through the Fold infrastructure.\n\nDespite the crypto banking crisis and the collapse of entities like the FTX exchange, Visa recently said it remains committed to investing in the crypto sector, after a report claimed otherwise. \"We believe that digital currencies will play a role in the future of financial services and money movement,\" Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa.\n\nRead More: Visa's Crypto Strategy Remains Intact Despite Crypto Winter\n\nCORRECTION (March 31, 2023, 06:40 UTC): Corrects lead to say that Fold has only partnered with Visa on debit products.

        "content": "The Bitcoin price saw an eye-catching move today, initially rising 2.8% ($810) in 30 minutes to reach a new yearly high at $29,182, only to fall to $28,080 in a very short period of time. At press time, Bitcoin showed renewed strength and was trading at $28,586.\n\nAnalyst Skew has several explanations for the puzzling movement of the BTC price. Aggregate CVDs & Delta show that there was a quick push into spot selling liquidity that was filled. In addition, the market showed a high premium under perps, meaning that perps led the price and the spot market began to sell.\n\n\u201cReaction is quick rally & sell off as crowded perp longs get caught on the downside volatility,\u201d explained the analyst, who also has another explanation in store. Looking at Bitcoin\u2019s Perp CVD Buckets & Delta Orders, the analyst noted increased whale movements that likely led to the move.\n\nWe\u2019re in whale town today it seems, the push up was cleanly orchestrated by whales & sold by whales. The odd one out here are the high leverage traders trying to short to zero & long to 100k lol. $BTC Binance Market CVDs & Delta: 15 min trend still intact bullish till we lose that trend.\n\nHe shared the chart below and added that it was forced selling and sell orders that drove the price down to meet limit buy orders. \u201cSomeone wants to get filled with size here. Pretty predatory & risky because other parties will notice this setup and hunt.\u201d\n\nMore Volatility To Come For Bitcoin On Friday\n\nFor several reasons at once, tomorrow could see even higher volatility. The first reason are the Bitcoin options, which have enjoyed rising popularity over the past few weeks.\n\nTomorrow is the quarterly settlement day, and the quarterly contracts are currently trading very actively, with short-term implied volatility continuing to rise, up nearly 10% in one day for the monthly maturity, according to Greeks Live.\n\nA total of 141,000 BTC options are about to expire, with a put-call ratio of 0.73, a maximum pain point of $24,000 and a notional value of $3.8 billion, the largest options exchange for Bitcoin, Deribit, shared via Twitter.\n\nLarge #options expiry coming this Friday 8 AM UTC \ud83d\ude80 141K #Bitcoin options are set to expire on Deribit with a notional value of $3.8 billion. \ud83d\udd25 Max pain $24,000, put/call ratio: 0.73#Ethereum max pain $1600, $3 B. notional value, put/call ratio 0.33 \ud83d\udd25#Cryptooptions #ETH pic.twitter.com/JTWSaamY5p \u2014 Deribit (@DeribitExchange) March 28, 2023\n\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index by the Bureau of Economic Analysis at 8:30 am EST will be the most important event of the week. The PCE is the Fed\u2019s preferred metric to gauge inflation and is therefore of great importance.\n\nCore PCE is forecasted to rise +0.6% month-over-month and +4.7% on an annualized basis. February PCE came in at +0.6%, but above the market forecast of 0.4%. The year-to-year reading was 4.7% in February (4.6% was expected). As a result, financial markets corrected southward.\n\nA similar scenario is conceivable tomorrow if the core PCE turns out worse than expected. However, if the core inflation rate increased less than analysts expect, the Bitcoin price is likely to receive confirmation for its upward trend.\n\nLast but not least, the monthly candle close is also coming up tomorrow, Friday. With a close at the current price levels, Bitcoin would confirm a clear breakout from the macro trend. Analysts at Rekt Capital shared the chart below and wrote:\n\nHistory has repeated itself. BTC has broken the macro downtrend. This time, around 385 days before the Halving. This Saturday, the BTC Monthly Candle will have closed above the macro downtrend to confirm a new bull market.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin has seen some good gains in the last day which eventually saw the digital asset climb over $29,000 for the first time in nine months, albeit briefly. But despite the price gains that the digital asset has seen in this time, it is still not the best performer in the crypto market as some altcoins continue to put up impressive rallies.\n\nARB, CFX, And 1INCH Make A Splash\n\nAs the week draws to a close, there have been some interesting movements from both Bitcoin and altcoins in the market. However, some altcoins continue to rise above and have been mostly in the green, especially in the last two days.\n\nThe digital assets that have been able to maintain their gains during this time include Conflux (CFX), Arbitrum (ARB), and 1inch Network (1INCH). At a time when altcoins are struggling to keep up with Bitcoin\u2019s gains, these assets continue to outperform.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, each of these digital assets has risen over 9%, sparking major interest in them. CFX which has been on a bullish momentum for the last week saw another 11.79% gain in the one-day period, bringing its price per coin to an impressive $0.4241.\n\nNext is 1INCH which has managed to claw its way out of obscurity and back into the spotlight. The token rose 10.16% in 24 hours to be trading at $0.5595. Its trading volume has also seen a major boost during this time as it rose over 231% to $80.9 million.\n\nAltcoins see higher gains than BTC | Source: Coinmarketcap\n\nFollowing behind is ARB with 9.38% gains. Now, ARB is interesting in that the coin was airdropped to users of the Arbitrum Layer 2 blockchain, and massive dumping followed shortly after, as expected. But after hitting a local low of $1.11 on Tuesday, the cryptocurrency has been on an uptrend since then. It is now trading at a price of $1.36, making it the third-highest gainer behind 1INCH.\n\nBitcoin Not Giving Up To Altcoins\n\nEven though these altcoins continue to outperform Bitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency is not giving up easily. It has been able to maintain the $28,000 territory despite mounting pressure from bears. It is also holding consistent gains on the weekly chart, which is not the same for most altcoins.\n\nBTC still trading above $28,600 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recovery is also moving the market, determining if investors remain bullish or not. Right now, as long as BTC continues to return gains and stay above its 50-day moving average, it remains on a path to re-enter a complete bull market.\n\nBitcoin is seeing gains of 0.72% in the last 24 hours to be trading at a price of $28,682 after briefly hitting $29,140, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Its trading volume is up 13% on the day and is now sitting above $22 billion.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from Binance, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin net taker volume is approaching a break above a line that has historically been a bullish signal for the price.\n\nBitcoin Net Taker Volume Has Been Moving Towards Zero Line Recently\n\nAs pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, this kind of crossover has appeared four times during the past year or so. The \u201cnet taker volume\u201d is an indicator that measures the difference between the taker buy and taker sell volumes in the market.\n\nThis metric shouldn\u2019t be confused with the taker buy/sell ratio, which, as its name already implies, tells us about the ratio between these two volumes, rather than their difference.\n\nWhen the net taker volume has a positive value, it means the taker buy volume is currently greater than the taker sell volume. Such a trend suggests that bullish sentiment is more dominant in the market right now.\n\nOn the other hand, the indicator having values less than zero implies the short volume is overwhelming the long volume at the moment, and hence, a bearish sentiment is shared by the majority of the investors.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) Bitcoin net taker volume over the last year:\n\nLooks like the 30-day MA value of the metric has been rising in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs you can see in the above graph, the quant has marked the relevant points of the trend for the 30-day MA Bitcoin net taker volume, as well as the corresponding pattern that the price of the asset displayed.\n\nIt seems like whenever this indicator has crossed above the zero line from the negative zone, the value of the cryptocurrency has followed up with riding on some upwards momentum.\n\n\u201cWhen the indicator crosses above zero, it means that over a 30D Moving Average, the volume through taker BUY orders is higher than taker SELL orders,\u201d explains the analyst. \u201cThis will result in buying strength for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIn total, there were previously four instances of this pattern during the past year or so. In some of these occurrences, the bullish effect came with a bit of delay, with the most prominent example of this being the crossover that eventually lead to the current rally in the BTC price.\n\nRecently, the 30-day MA Bitcoin taker net volume has been inside the negative zone, meaning that sell orders have dominated the market. However, in the last few days, the metric\u2019s value has been rising, and it is now once again approaching the zero level.\n\nIf the indicator continues on this trajectory, then a crossover into the positive zone can take place, which, if the past pattern is anything to go by, may have a constructive effect on the price.\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $28,300, up 1% in the last week.\n\nBTC has sharply risen in the past day | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from 2 Bull Photography on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin price rally over the last few days has bulls once again eyeing levels the coin hasn't seen since the start of the year. The largest cryptocurrency by market value rose nearly 4% at one point Monday, reaching $47,881. That's its highest level since the start of the year and the propulsion rounds out its year-to-date gains to around 3%. Elsewhere, the MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 100 index -- which tracks tracks the performance of some of the largest digital assets -- was up more than 5% as of 12:04 p.m. in New York.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies had been, up until the last few weeks, mired in a similar downtrend as other riskier assets, like U.S. stocks. But a weekend rally above $45,000, a key level watched by chartists, helped garner momentum for a bigger breakout. The coin has added 15% over the past week.\n\n\u201cIt's been a choppy start to the year, not just for crypto, but across all asset classes. So I think certainly, it's an exciting morning in the crypto community to see that year-long, so far, of losses erased, and also seeing Bitcoin break out above that psychological $45,000 level,\u201d Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. He added that \u201cwhat we're seeing is a couple of native crypto buyers like Terra buying for their own reserves,\u201d which could help support prices.\n\nDo Kwon, the co-founder and chief executive officer of the firm behind the Terra blockchain, confirmed that it has purchased more than $1 billion in Bitcoin since the end of January, Bloomberg News reported on Monday. Analysts are also pointing to other developments for the renewed optimism around crypto, with some citing comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who said in a March 25 interview with CNBC that despite her own skepticism about the asset class, \u201cthere are benefits from crypto and we recognize that innovation in the payment system can be a healthy thing.\u201d\n\nThe rally has brought Bitcoin into technically overbought levels, based on its Relative Strength Index (RSI) score of 71. Assets are considered overbought if its RSI crosses above 70 and oversold if it falls below 30. Overbought levels tend to bring out projections for a short-term breather, though strategists at Bespoke Investment Group say it's not always been the case that those conditions lead to a downturn and can instead portend further gains.\n\nMatt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., says he's looking at Bitcoin's 200-day moving average, which is currently around $48,270 -- that could provide some short-term resistance. But beyond that, chartists will be focused on $50,000 \u201cbecause it's a big round number.\u201d He's also looking at $51,000, which represents a late-December high.\n\nBitcoin remains about 30% below the record high of around $69,000 reached in November."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) briefly flashed above the $29,000 mark on Thursday, hitting new highs for 2023. This comes amid increased crackdowns by US regulatory agencies on crypto exchanges and other businesses in the space, resulting in fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) amongst investors.\n\nAccording to data from TradingView and CoinMarketCap, the Bitcoin price reached $29,191 on Binance, revisiting levels last seen in November last year, just before the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX crypto exchange.\n\nBitcoin Trades In The Green Despite Recent Regulatory Crackdowns\n\nThe increase in the price of the flagship cryptocurrency comes in the wake of regulatory crackdowns on crypto firms. On March 27, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged Binance, its CEO Changpeng Zhao and its former CCO Samuel Lim of violating trading and derivatives laws.\n\nFollowing the news, the big crypto tanked by 6.5% losing the support provided by the $28,000 psychological level. Binance\u2019s inhouse token, Binance Coin (BNB), dropped as much as 8% from $330 to lows of around $300 on the same day.\n\nThe regulatory crackdown claimed its new victim on March 29 as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced charges against the crypto asset trading platform Beaxy and its executives. The regulator claims that Beaxy failed to register as a national securities exchange, broker and clearing agency. The SEC also charges the Beaxy founder for raising $8 million with an unregistered asset BXY and misappropriation of at least $900K for personal use.\n\nThis marks the second major lawsuit on a crypto company this month and the fourth in the span of two months, including the charges the SEC announced against the now-apprehended Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon\n\nThe fact that BTC\u2019s price has grown amid such bearish developments has surprised many market commentators. This is because some believe the Binance lawsuit will only result in minor fines for the largest crypto exchange by transaction volume.\n\nNote that the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, which numerically tracks current \u201cemotions and sentiments\u201d in the crypto market,has been increasing steadily over the last month, despite the turmoil in the global banking sector.\n\nAccording to data from Alternative, this index has gone back to the \u201cGreed\u201d zone, suggesting that investors are buying more.\n\nCrypto Fear and Greed Index\n\nSome analysts attribute the recent bullish trend displayed by Bitcoin to buying by large-volume traders, which was more related to their buying strategies than fundamentals.\n\nBitcoin Bulls May Exploit A Bullish Flag To $40,000\n\nBTC price action has created a bullish flag on the daily chart (below). This is a highly bullish pattern that signals the continuation of an uptrend. It was formed when Bitcoin bounced off the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $19,718, and rose sharply (46%), before correcting to areas below $27,500.\n\nThe correction is usually believed to be an opportunity for buyers to take a breather while allowing late investors to get in on the minor dip, before the uptrend continues. It is usually confirmed when a close is achieved above the flag. The target is set by measuring the percentage increase represented by the flag\u2019s post and adding it to the point of break out above the flag.\n\nThe chart below shows that Bitcoin escaped from the flag on March 29 paving the way for a massive move upward. As such, BTC\u2019s price may grow from the current levels, with the first barrier arising from today\u2019s intraday high of $29,191. Clearing this hurdle would clear the path for the pioneer cryptocurrency to move toward the technical target of the prevailing chart pattern at $40,113. Such a move would represent a 40% uptick from the current price.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nSupporting Bitcoin\u2019s bullish outlook was the up-facing moving averages and the position of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the positive region. The price strength at 66 suggested that the bulls were in control of the BTC price.\n\nIn addition, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator was moving above the zero line in the positive region. Note that this trend-following indicator abandoned a sell signal on March 29, suggesting that the recent uptrend was strong. The position of the MACD in the positive region shows that the market still favors the upside.\n\nConversely, things could go awry for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization if the price turns down from the current levels to produce a daily candlestick close below $28,000. Such a move would trigger sell orders that could see Bitcoin retreat to $27,500 or $25,000.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Will Crypto Recover? Here's What You Should Know - GOBankingRates",
        "content": "Chinnapong / Getty Images\n\nCrypto is an investment that is widely known for its volatility, with dramatic fluctuations that can work in an investor\u2019s favor or against it. Both scenarios have played out so far in 2023 and many are wondering what might be next, so here is a look.\n\nWill Crypto Recover in 2023?\n\nSeveral factors play a role in whether or not crypto will recover this year, including but not limited to:\n\nHow the banking industry fares, given recent closures.\n\nWhether or not the government continues to back assets held at closed banks, especially collapsed banks that held crypto investments.\n\nHow investor sentiment shifts as economic developments and policy efforts continue.\n\nWill Crypto Come Back Up Again?\n\nCurrent speculation hints at a potentially uncertain year ahead for crypto, despite a relatively robust start to 2023. Analysts will be watching the price of bitcoin, and many feel that its ability or lack thereof to hold a value of $25,000 will be a telltale sign for the cryptocurrency. The actions of the Federal Reserve will also play a critical role in investor confidence.\n\nThese are the factors at play, but the question remains: Is the crypto market ever going to recover?\n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to predict the trajectory of cryptocurrency because, like all investments, there is never a guarantee of performance or return. What is known is that historically this type of investment has yielded plenty of gains and losses over time, and that dual reality is likely to continue.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nWhat Makes Crypto Different from Other Investments\n\nUnlike stocks, ETFs or even U.S. savings bonds, crypto is a highly speculative investment with a long history of dramatic ups and downs. Certainly, crypto has experienced crashes before.\n\nNASDAQ reported that the last crypto winter occurred from January 2018 to early 2021. The crypto market has served as both a safe haven and a source of unpredictability for investors, but it is beginning to behave more like traditional asset classes.\n\nAlthough crypto is growing in popularity, with an increasing number of companies accepting it as a form of payment, no one knows if today\u2019s coins will be around decades from now.\n\nAn Investment You Can Easily Buy Low\n\nThe longstanding investment advice to buy low and sell high is quite possible with cryptocurrency, given its sometimes erratic nature. As long as you\u2019re not a risk-averse investor, it\u2019s not too late to buy the dip in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. To increase your odds of investment success, watch a coin\u2019s overall performance and fees, know your storage and security options, pick a reputable exchange and stick to coins with a known reputation and a high market cap.\n\nDawn Allcot and Chris Ozarowski contributed to the reporting for this article.\n\nInformation is accurate as of March 30, 2023."

        "content": "As per Bitcoin Analysis, Goldman Sachs, one of the most prominent firms in global investment banking and finance, highlights Bitcoin (BTC) as the best-performing asset in the first quarter of 2023, surpassing Nasdaq. 100, Gold, S & P 500 and other investment assets and sectors.\n\nAlong with BTC, Dogecoin (DOGE) also shows price surges after a bearish phase as news of Elon Musk integrating Twitter with DOGE came to the surface. The new meme coin in the crypto arena Big Eyes Coin (BIG), captivates the hearts of cryptocurrency enthusiasts with its new 250% bonus code.\n\nBitcoin To Reach $ 1 Million in 90 Days\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has gained 51% in YTD absolute returns, leaving behind IT (16%), Communication services (15%), Consumer Discretionary (11%), Russell 1000 Growth (10%), Gold (4%) and S & P 500 (4%). The coin\u2019s price rise is ascribed to the US Federal Reserve letting go of its intrusive monetary policy.\n\nIt has increased by 35% since March 10th, when Silicon Valley Bank shut down.\n\nIn contrast to 2022, the price of the primary digital asset has skyrocketed from $16500 on January 1st to $27901 at the time of writing.\n\nDigital Currency news says this might begin a new bull run for BTC. Ryan Selkis, CEO of Crypto Intelligence, Messari, forecasted its valuation to rise to $100,000 in the coming year. However, Balaji Srinivasan, Coinbase\u2019s former CTO, wagered $2 million against Twitter user James Medlock that BTC would be worth $1 million in 3 months.\n\nDogecoin: Acceptable Form OF Payment On Twitter\n\nElon Musk has filed for Twitter to be a money service business, meaning it could send cryptocurrencies and other fiat payments back and forth. Musk has always been a DOGE supporter and has been the raison d\u2019etre for Dogecoin\u2019s popularity. With the news of the altcoin\u2019s integration with Twitter surfacing, the price of DOGE surged by more than 50%.\n\nIn his usual style, Elon tweeted a picture of the Shiba Inu dog wearing a T-shirt with the Twitter logo and a wink emoji. Dogecoin is already an acceptable form of payment at other companies he runs- SpaceX and Tesla. Last year he also revealed that Dogecoin is one of the three cryptos he has ever invested in, along with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). DOGE remains the only crypto meme coin that his companies accept.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Offers 250% Bonus\n\nThe new meme coin Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is now on the final countdown to its launch. At stage 12 of a super successful presale, the cute coin has already raised $32.4 million.\n\nA coin centred around its community, and Big Eyes had always brought a spark to its presale right from stage 1 when the BIG token was worth $0.0001 to $0.00049 at present.\n\nThis means investors who purchased BIG during stage 1 earned 390% ROI. With rewards, bonuses and promo codes, BIG ensures every investor gets equal financial growth opportunities.\n\nWith its Loot Boxes that give 1000% ROI to the latest BULLRUN250 promo code, Big Eyes Coin is high on giving crypto enthusiasts a chance to make big money.

        "title": "Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow: can S2F predict BTC price? - Young Platform",
        "content": "The Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model (S2F) is a method for calculating the scarcity of gold that can also be useful in predicting BTC price. Let\u2019s go find out what it is and how it works, looking at the S2F\u2019s past accuracy and its estimates for thefuture.\n\nWhat is the Stock-to-Flow model and how does it work?\n\nFinancial market players have several tools at their disposal to try to anticipate price movements. In particular, there is a model that tries to predict the price of Bitcoin: the Stock-to-Flow (S2F or S/F), let\u2019s see what it is and how it works.\n\nFirst of all, however, we must point out that, using the graphs of technical analysis and the macroeconomic factors of fundamental analysis, you can only make assumptions, never certain forecasts. Before making any transactions, you need to do your own research (DYOR) Also, do not forget to always take into account the risks involved in buying and owning cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Stock-to-Flow model values the scarcity of goods, a quality that should influence their value, given the law of supply and demand: if demand exists and is constant, the price of an object theoretically increases the rarer it is. This relationship is evident in those goods that are difficult to produce, considering the costs as well as the time and energy involved. Think of gold and other rare metals, raw materials with a limited and almost constant supply over time, since in the short term it is not easy to increase the quantity extracted, net of technological innovation.\n\nThe Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model, given this basis, calculates the ratio between the Stock, i.e. the total availability of an object, and the Flow, i.e. the new annual production. The number obtained corresponds to the years it would take to double the current supply, at the current rate of creation. In practice, how long it would take to reproduce the already existing quantity of a certain good.\n\nLet\u2019s quote some figures to better understand what the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model is: the World Gold Council\u2018s latest estimate (February 2023) suggests that a total of 208,874 tonnes of gold have been mined throughout history. Statista.com contributes by stating that 3100 tonnes were obtained in 2022, a number that usually varies between 2500 and 3300. The resulting S/F ratio, therefore, is about 67 years (208,874/3100): a measure of scarcity that, worked out in other formulae, can give an estimate of the future price.\n\nCan the Stock-to-Flow model predict BTC price?\n\nPlan B, a famous Twitter user, then redefined what the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model is, applying his logic to Bitcoin in order to try and predict its price. In his article Modeling Bitcoin Value with Scarcity, he quotes Satoshi Nakamoto himself, who presents his cryptocurrency as the first scarce digital asset:\n\n\u201cAs a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: boring grey in colour, not a good conductor of electricity, not particularly strong, [\u2026] not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose and one special, magical property: can be transported over a communications channel\u201d\n\nThe scarcity of this \u2018Internet metal\u2019 is ensured by the mining mechanism, through which it is \u2018mined\u2018 as if it were gold. In fact, Bitcoin is often called digital gold: new coins are minted as a reward for each block created by miners. Specifically, one is added to the Bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes and this rate is maintained by an algorithm, which increases or decreases the difficulty of the calculations to be performed. This process has an \u2018unforgeable costliness\u2019: it is impossible to produce BTC without using a lot of energy or ignoring precise rules.\n\nFirst, the maximum availability of Bitcoin is set at 21 million units, distributed according to the Halving programme. In practice, every 4 years (210,000 blocks) this mechanism halves the reward for miners, so that the production of new BTC is reduced by half. Therefore, the annual Flow gradually decreases and, when compared to the existing Stock, can give us an estimate of scarcity and value. Let us therefore look more specifically at how the Stock-to-Flow model works in the case of digital gold.\n\nCurrently, 900 new Bitcoins come into circulation every day, a total of 328,500 per year; total availability, however, is around 19,400,000, so the S2F model shows a shortage of 59 points. This ratio, however, is set to double as a result of the next halving in 2024, which will raise the premium per block from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, thus halving the annual Flow. Simply put, as more and more Bitcoins are in circulation, the annual production of new coins will be reduced to 164,250. At this \u2018halving\u2019 rate, it is estimated that the last BTC will be created in 2140, when it will reach maximum scarcity, given an almost infinite S/F ratio!\n\nPlan B, therefore, collected data on the price of Bitcoin throughout history and noted a statistically significant correlation with the Stock-to-Flow model. Specifically, it compared the trend of BTC to its S/F ratio, raised to power and multiplied by a constant to obtain a curve. This exponential function was optimised over time, changing various coefficients, but showed some correspondence to Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nFun Fact The Stock-to-Flow model tries to predict the value of Bitcoin through the formula price=exp(-1.84) * SF^3.36\n\nLooking at the graph, the price increases seem to occur as a result of Halving, although it is a simple correlation and not a definite cause. In any case, these events have a direct effect on the S/F ratio and the Stock-to-Flow model, in fact, was able to follow Bitcoin\u2019s price more or less correctly during the bull run of 2020/21, which led it to an all-time high of $69,000. However, from March 2022 onwards, the S2F model\u2019s estimates lost consistency with Bitcoin\u2019s actual trend, raising several doubts.\n\nCriticism of the Stock-to-Flow model: flaws and deviations\n\nThe price of Bitcoin observed a drastic drop in the bear market of 2022, which was not justified by the Stock-to-Flow model. In contrast, the version proposed by PlanB projected a value of $100,000 by the end of the year. Criticism was not long in coming and Vitalik Buterin even called the false sense of certainty given by the S2F \u2018harmful\u2019.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that when talking about the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow, we have always called it a model, a hypothetical estimate, and it should be treated as such. In fact, S2F has some flaws: by nature, it only considers the weight of supply and ignores actual demand. In short, scarcity is not enough to stimulate the price, which does not increase if there is a lack of demand. Moreover, Bitcoin is an experimental technology, although it is more than 15 years old: its historicity is not comparable to that of gold, which has been established as a safe haven asset for hundreds of years.\n\nFinally, although Bitcoin scarcity is not regulated by price but by automated algorithms, these cannot counter unpredictable events (Black Swan) that can lead to high volatility. Examples of these are the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem or the failure of the FTX exchange, cases impossible to anticipate, which had consequences for the price of Bitcoin. In short, the reality suggested by the Stock-to-Flow model is static and partial, because it is limited to \u2018programmed\u2019 factors, such as Halving and Bitcoin\u2019s maximum availability, failing to consider macroeconomic aspects.\n\nThe inconsistency of the model, however, did not surprise Plan B, which proposed two alternative scenarios: either BTC is extremely undervalued, or the Stock-to-Flow model, as it works, will be less useful for forecasting in the future. In any case, it does not consider its analysis to be a complete failure because, by considering two standard deviations from the S2F curve, it is possible to obtain fluctuation bands, which still seem to justify Bitcoin\u2019s price."

Although his prediction has been rebuked by Matthew Kratter, founder of the Trader University YouTube channel, he does agree it is \u201cdirectionally correct.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Finbold has reported on Bitcoin\u2019s market cap surpassing that of traditional finance behemoths such as payment platform Visa (NYSE: V) and banking giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), as well as outperforming the year-to-date (YTD) returns of 97% of all S&P 500 companies in 2023.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "With the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies, it is no surprise that celebrities and athletes are taking an interest, including the former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) two-division champion Conor McGregor who has partnered with various crypto businesses, leading many to wonder how much Bitcoin (BTC) he held.\n\nIndeed, after becoming the poster boy for Dapper Labs\u2019 blockchain collectibles through CryptoKitties developer\u2019s partnership with UFC in early 2021, the featherweight and lightweight double-champion has entered into various partnerships and endorsement deals that have to do with the crypto market.\n\nIn September 2022, McGregor was featured in an advertisement for the trading platform XTB which facilitates the exchange of digital assets, commodities, stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and more, as the global fintech company announced his two-year gig as its brand ambassador.\n\nCatching the fallout?\n\nMore recently, in the fallout of the FTX collapse, it came to the public\u2019s attention that the Switzerland-based centralized crypto exchange Tiger.Trade (TT), endorsed by McGregor, had connections to Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s platform, which has claimed that TT was only a partner through integration and it held no responsibility for its partners.\n\nWho wants to play?!!! The only rule is to play #SmarterNotHarder \ud83e\udd4a \ud83d\udc05 Conor McGregor in the game! Are you ready to win with @tiger_trade? https://t.co/FlJX5prxHf pic.twitter.com/9ZCrRizxWC \u2014 Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) September 12, 2022\n\nHaving said that, despite the Irish MMA star\u2019s various exposures to digital assets and rumors of crypto investments, it is currently unknown how much Bitcoin he has, if any.\n\nOther crypto celebs\n\nMeanwhile, McGregor is not the only UFC fighter, let alone the only famous individual endorsing crypto, as the former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou gave serious thought to accepting 50% of his fight purse in Bitcoin, as Finbold reported in January 2022, and his decision was in the crypto\u2019s favor.\n\nAt the same time, American socialite Kim Kardashian came into the limelight after being charged, along with former boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr., and former basketball player Paul Pierce, by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the social media promotion of a controversial digital asset offered by EthereumMax (EMAX).\n\nIt should also be noted that Crypto.com became the first-ever crypto exchange platform to establish a long-term partnership with UFC as its global Official Fight Kit Partner and UFC\u2019s first-ever Official Cryptocurrency Platform Partner as part of a 10-year deal worth $175 million signed in July 2021."
