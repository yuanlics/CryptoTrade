        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nFilip Radwanski | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin is up 50% this year despite the collapse of major crypto-focused banks, beating major stock indexes and commodities. On Jan. 1, bitcoin began trading at just over $16,500. On Wednesday, it was hovering around the $25,000 mark, thanks to a rally that began on Sunday. The surge in price this year comes after bitcoin crashed 65% in 2022 after a number of major collapses of projects and hedge funds, bankruptcies, liquidity issues and the failure of FTX, one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges. The recent rise has come as somewhat of a surprise, given the closure of Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank, two of the biggest lenders to the crypto industry. And Silicon Valley Bank, viewed as the backbone of the technology startup industry, also failed.\n\n\"Bitcoin's 50% surge in 2023 is a reflection of how beaten down it was post the FTX collapse, the changing interest rate outlook and the failure (& resurrection) of SVB,\" Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto trading platform Nexo, told CNBC. From its peak of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, bitcoin is still down more than 60%. Here are some of the main reasons bitcoin is up.\n\nBank collapses\n\nWhile the collapse of Silvergate, Signature Bank and SVB sent shockwaves through financial markets, bitcoin's rebound could also be fueled by those very failures, according to Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno. \"This past week's events around the failure of SVB and other banks have also shone a spotlight on the power of decentralised currencies that people can fully custody and own,\" Ayyar said. \"Decentralised finance is beginning to hit home in terms of a concept to many more people now.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nBitcoin is called a decentralized currency because it isn't issued by a single entity like a central bank. Instead, it relies on an underlying technology called blockchain and its network is maintained by a community. U.S. regulators had to step in to guarantee customer deposits at these banks, however. Nexo's Trenchev said the intervention \"reminded investors about the structural deficiencies of the U.S. banking system and the U.S. dollar underpinning it, reasons why we've seen a flight to Bitcoin this week.\" Bitcoin proponents have claimed the digital currency is a way for investors to protect themselves against central bank moves, particularly quantitative easing and looser monetary policy, which they say erodes the value of fiat currency. Proponents point to bitcoin's finite supply as a key feature of it being a store of value.\n\nInterest rate outlook\n\nThe bank collapses came after a year of interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve. SVB's issue was that it had to sell off assets, mainly Treasurys, to shore up its balance sheet as depositors withdrew funds. But it sold those assets at a hefty loss because interest rate rises had pushed the price of Treasurys lower. Some analysts have suggested the stress on the financial sector could slow down the pace of rate hikes from the Fed, which could help risk assets, such as stocks and bitcoin. That came even after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said days before the bank collapses that rates are likely to be higher than policymakers anticipated.\n\n\"In the space of a few days we'd turned from a hawkish Powell to an environment where economists were predicting the Fed might not even hike rates in March, benefiting Bitcoin,\" Trenchev said. \"It's been said that the Fed will only stop hiking rates when they break something, and now that something is broken, attention has turned to Bitcoin.\"\n\nBitcoin vs. stocks"

        "content": "New York, NY - (NewMediaWire) - March 16, 2023 - Decimal Digital Currency, a leading cryptocurrency mining, infrastructure, and technology company, has launched its newest Bitcoin mining operation at the expansive Wolf Hollow data center in Granbury, Texas. The massive 300-megawatt data center is owned by Generate Capital, a premier, sustainable infrastructure investment and operating platform, and managed by U.S. Bitcoin Corp., which recently announced a merger with public miner Hut 8.\n\nDespite the scarcity of crypto mining hosting capacity and rising rates across North America, Decimal has secured an agreement with Generate Capital and U.S. Bitcoin Corp to deploy a portion of its latest generation, ultra-efficient S19XP Bitcoin mining machines, which it purchased from Bitmain.\n\nWolf Hollow was purpose-built by Compute North for efficient Bitcoin mining, despite Texas' hot summer temperatures. The facility is directly connected to the power station and provides grid-balancing and demand response services to the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The data center's curtailment capabilities provide the ability to quickly respond during peak demand times which stress the grid and allow power to be allocated for mission-critical use, such as hospitals.\n\nRoshan Shah, Co-Founder and CEO of Decimal, commented: \"The Decimal team is thrilled with the launch of this new cryptocurrency mining facility at one of the cleanest and most innovative data centers in the United States. Among other business lines in crypto, Decimal is rapidly expanding its mining business and entering into new joint venture partnerships as well as actively seeking merger and acquisition opportunities. We are well poised to deploy tens of thousands of additional rigs in the near to medium term and intend to dramatically accelerate our growth. We're excited about this new partnership with Generate Capital, U.S. Bitcoin, and Hut 8 as we scale our mining platform and geodiversify our decentralized crypto mining operations.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHenry Robinson, Co-Founder and President of Decimal, added, \"The Bitcoin price surge to nearly $70,000 attracted many amateur miners seeking easy returns, but they have since realized that mining is often a cyclical business with very complex economics. Decimal has been in the mining business for a long enough tenure that we were able to actively prepare for a bear market; our operations are underpinned by a very risk-averse strategy. Meanwhile, industry-wide failures to mitigate risk have created sound opportunities to substantially expand our business. Decimal's Wolf Hollow deployment is a significant step forward in our pipeline of new projects.\"\n\nCompute North was the developer of the Wolf Hollow facility and one of largest developers and operators of cryptocurrency focused data centers with over 700 megawatts of hosting capacity operating or under development prior to their filing. Compute North filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last September, just shortly after raising over $300 million at over a $1 billion valuation.\n\nDecimal was appointed to the Plan Oversight Committee for Compute North Holding's bankruptcy proceedings. Decimal Digital Currency's responsibilities now include authority and responsibility to oversee and review the activities of the Plan Administrator, who is administering the assets for distribution. Decimal has the authority and responsibility to oversee and review the activities of the Litigation Trustee and the authority to seek to remove the Plan Administrator for \"cause.\"\n\nFor more information about Decimal digital, visit decimalgroup.io\n\nMedia Details:\n\nHenry Robinson\n\nDecimal Digital Currency\n\nhenry@decimalgroup.io\n\ndecimalgroup.io"

        "content": "The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last week raises serious issues far more significant than the obvious ones cited by the financial press and a broad range of Washington politicians.\n\nChief among these are bank loans against dubious assets. That's not getting much if any attention in the news or from Washington and is likely to soon be swept under the rug, allowing needlessly risky banking practices to continue.\n\nBefore its collapse last week, SVB made loans against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe question: why is any bank anywhere allowed to accept crypto as collateral for loans?\n\nBitcoin and its imitators are not money. They are not currency. They're hardly used to buy and sell, an unsurprising fact given that by design the Bitcoin system can process only seven transactions per second compared to many thousands of transactions per second for credit cards.\n\nIndeed, except for laundering proceeds from drug trafficking as well as hiding assets from creditors, estranged spouses, and the tax police, cryptocurrencies have no use.\n\nHigh-tech Ponzi Scheme\n\nCryptocurrencies and their cousins, Non-Fungible Tokens or NFTs\u2014are just a high-tech Ponzi scheme. Instead of Charlie Ponzi or Bernie Madoff personally running the con, the crypto scam relies on decentralized computer blockchain and \"mining\" of mathematical solutions.\n\nBitcoin's supposed inventor, who went by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, has never been identified. He or she has since vanished, leaving holders with a digital string worth only as much as the next fool, or crook, will pay for this imaginary asset.\n\nEarly participants in Ponzi schemes profit mightily if they cash out while the gullible souls who get sucked in later wipe out. That is what happened to SVB, America's 16th largest bank, which was big on crypto loans.\n\nMany Bitcoin \"investors\" have already been wiped out as the \"market cap\" of Bitcoin plummeted from nearly $1.3 trillion in 2021 to about $389 billion on Friday, down almost 70%.\n\nWhy do banking regulators allow our federally insured and regulated banks to make loans using magic internet money as collateral? That's a crazy policy, no different than allowing banks to accept buckets of ice cubes in winter as collateral, even though they melt come spring and evaporate in summer\n\nSilicon Valley Bank is just one of many federally insured financial institutions that accept crypto currency as collateral for loans. Some banks will loan you 90% of the seemingly value of your crypto, though 50% loan-to-value is more common and that appears to be the standard at SVB based on its web pages.\n\nZero Interest Crypto Loans\n\nAll sorts of financial news outlets offer advice on borrowing against crypto. These include NerdWallet, and the increasingly na\u00efve and unreliable Forbes. People with crypto can even borrow at zero interest. Gadzooks!\n\nFor a sober look at the big risks of crypto loans read Investopedia's essay.\n\nIn the wake of the second largest bank failure in history, you should be deeply concerned that for more than four decades we have failed miserably at regulating banks. That history contrasts with the period from 1935 until voters abandoned the moderating and successful New Deal banking rules in favor of Reaganomics.\n\nWe took a wrong turn when the prudent New Deal banking regulations in effect from 1935 were killed by Reaganomics, which re-regulated banks to reduce regulations and increase the risk of financial institutions failing. (There is no such thing as deregulation, only new regulation, which in our time on terms typically means regulations favoring corporations, including banks, over customers, financial prudence, and public safety.)\n\nCongress's Role\n\nWhat we need now are Congressional hearings to examine the reasons that cryptocurrencies can be collateral for bank loans.\n\nContact the White House in writing via the hypertext link or call 202-456-1111 to demand a ban on crypto as loan collateral. Call 202-456-1111.\n\nEven if you don't own Bitcoin or its growing list of alternatives this story matters to you for multiple reasons.\n\nYour money is only insured up to $250,000. Any money above that isn't insured. That means if you're a trustee of a nonprofit, for example, and it's got $1 million in the bank you or the organization you help lead is at risk of being wiped out in a bank failure.\n\nThe federal government is covering all deposits for SVB and at Signature Bank in New York, which failed Sunday. But that doesn't mean it always will. During an earlier banking crisis nonprofits with more than the guarantee then in effect of $100,000 lost their deposits above that sum, which got very little news coverage at the time.\n\nIf people want to buy crypto, they should be free to do so. But they should not be allowed to put our bank deposits and investments at risk by using these digital tokens as collateral for loans. After all, it's your, and my bank deposits, along with those of businesses, nonprofits, and our governments that the banks use to make loans, so it's not like we don't have a deep interest in blocking crypto of any kind as collateral for loans."

Earlier Thursday, bitcoin briefly touched $25,000, which has been a key level watched by chart analysts.\n\nGlobal markets were further rocked this week after Credit Suisse revealed \"material weaknesses\" in its finances and the Saudi National Bank said it wouldn't invest additional capital to shore up the beleaguered Swiss lender. Late Wednesday, the Swiss National Bank stepped in, allowing Credit Suisse to borrow up to about $54 billion, easing immediate concerns over Credit Suisse's liquidity."

        "content": "Bitcoin rose in Friday morning trading in Asia to near the US$25,000 mark. Ether and the rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also gained as global equity markets stabilized following moves by authorities in the U.S. and Europe to backstop banks with cash after a series of failures in the industry this past week threatened to spread. BNB led the crypto winners as a U.S. court overruled government objections and approved the Binance US$1 billion deal to buy bankrupt crypto lender Voyager.\n\nSee related article: US, Germany shut ChipMixer for alleged ties to US$3 bln crypto laundering\n\nBitcoin rose 2.75% in the past 24 hours to US$24,973 at 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency jumped 24% over the past seven days, the largest gain among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Some commentators argue Bitcoin acted as a safe haven for investors as bank failures shook global equity markets this week.\n\nEther edged up 1.32% to trade at US$1,668, a gain of 17% for the past seven days.\n\nBNB, the native token of the Binance crypto exchange, led the winners on Friday with a 7.56% jump to US$327.98. A U.S. court judge on Wednesday rejected the government\u2019s appeal to block a US$1 billion offer by Binance U.S. to buy the assets of the failed Voyager platform. The token added 19.51% for the seven-day-period.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic token climbed 2.88% to US$1.14, logging a weekly gain of 14.04%. Salesforce, one of the world\u2019s biggest enterprise software firms with a market cap of more than US$150 billion, has entered a partnership with Polygon blockchain to help its clients build non-fungible token-related (NFT) programs, according to a tweet by Polygon Labs on Thursday. Saleforce previously launched a suite of customer relationship management tools for Web3 developers.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 1.91% in the past 24 hours to US$1.08 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours fell 25.30% to US$61.92 billion.\n\nU.S. equities closed higher in a relief rally on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 1.17%, the S&P 500 rose 1.76%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.48%.\n\nThe gains in equities came after Credit Suisse on Thursday said it would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs (US$54 billion) from the Swiss National Bank to shore up liquidity. On the U.S. side, 11 U.S. financial institutions injected US$30 billion into First Republic Bank on Thursday after the bank\u2019s share price fell sharply on fears of a bank run.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Congress on Thursday that the U.S. \u201cbanking system remains sound\u201d, and \u201cthe Federal Reserve is providing additional support to the banking system with a new lending facility.\u201d\n\nOn the inflation front, the U.S. Department of Labor on Thursday reported a drop in unemployment benefit claims in the week ending March 11 that was more than expected, indicating a strong labor market that supports the view the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again this month.\n\nU.S. interest rates are between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 79.7% chance the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points this month. The chance of no rate increase is at 20.3%, down from 45.4% on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose 6% on year in February, a deceleration from 6.4% in January, but still well above the Fed\u2019s goal to keep annual inflation below 2%."

        "content": "Crypto donations worth hundreds of millions of dollars have supported Ukrainian war efforts.\n\nThe decentralized nature of crypto allows digital currencies to be traded quickly, making them a useful tool for getting money into conflict zones.\n\nGiven the potential benefits and risks associated with crypto, public and private organizations across sectors are considering new regulations.\n\nDigital tools have significantly influenced the war in Ukraine. The conflict is one of the most well-documented military campaigns in history and marks the first major cyberwar between two countries. Crypto has also played a prominent role in the war.\n\nToday, as the conflict enters its second year, over $212 million worth of crypto has been donated to pro-Ukrainian war efforts, according to Elliptic, a blockchain analytics firm. This includes roughly $80 million worth of crypto going directly to the Ukrainian government.\n\n\u201c The people of Ukraine are grateful for the support and donations from the global crypto community as we protect our freedom. \u201d \u2014 Ukrainian government on Twitter, May 2022\n\nThe decentralized nature of crypto allows digital currencies to be traded quickly, making them a useful tool for getting money into conflict and disaster zones.\n\n\u201cAn important benefit of these emerging technologies is the ability to mobilize, organize and deliver very quickly,\u201d said Brynly Llyr, Head of Blockchain and Digital Assets at the World Economic Forum. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this play out in real time in Ukraine where you saw millions of aid delivered in a day.\u201d\n\nChainalysis, another major blockchain analysis firm, reported that in the first month of the war, the Ukrainian government received more than $56 million in crypto donations. Most of the donations, Chainalysis found, have been made in bitcoin and ethereum.\n\nLoading...\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are unique digital assets generally created in a blockchain, have also been used to support the war efforts. For example, Ukraine DAO\u2014a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) set up to harness \u201cthe power of Web3 tech and community to defend Ukraine,\u201d according to the online collective\u2014auctioned off a Ukrainian flag NFT for $6.75 million.\n\n\u201cAlthough such donations pale in comparison to fiat donations, they demonstrate the philanthropy of cryptocurrency enthusiasts across the globe and Ukraine\u2019s willingness to accept a wide variety of digital assets,\u201d Chainalysis noted in a recent report.\n\nCrypto is also being used to support Russia, albeit to a lesser degree. Chainalysis reported that roughly 100 pro-Russian groups have raised around $5.4 million worth of crypto over the past year. Meanwhile, Elliptic found that total pro-Ukrainian crypto fundraising since the war began tops pro-Russian funding by 44 to one.\n\nIn recent years, the use of cryptocurrencies has increased in economies around the world. The adoption has varied across industries ranging from gaming to banking and has been fueled by economic trends like inflation.\n\n\u201cYou clearly see that economies with a weak national currency and a currency that might have a lot of inflation, those ones are typically the first ones to jump into crypto and see it as another good way to pay each other and to store value,\u201d Michael Gronager, the CEO of Chainalysis, said in an interview during the World Economic Forum\u2019s Annual Meeting 2023 in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nIn 2022, Ukraine ranked third in Chainalysis\u2019 Global Crypto Adoption Index; Russia ranked ninth. Both countries, which experienced significant inflation and economic distribution because of the war, saw increases in crypto transfers immediately following the invasion, Chainalysis found.\n\n\u201c The war has affected virtually all aspects of life in the two countries, and cryptocurrency is no exception. \u201d \u2014 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report 2022, Chainalysis\n\nMoreover, there has been widespread concern about Russian efforts to use crypto to raise funds and evade international sanctions. Elliptic reported that over 10% of pro-Russian crypto donations come from illicit sources like sanctioned entities or cybercrime activities.\n\nYet experts also note that the scale of sanctions evasion through crypto remains limited\u2014and continue to urge robust monitoring of illicit crypto efforts. \u201cOur research showed that cryptocurrency markets likely aren\u2019t liquid enough to support mass scale, systematic sanctions evasion,\u201d Chainalysis stated in a report.\n\nIn 2022, Ukraine ranked third in Chainalysis\u2019 Global Crypto Adoption Index; Russia ranked ninth. Image: REUTERS/Viacheslav Ratynskyi\n\nGiven the potential benefits and risks associated with crypto\u2014including sanctions evasion, cybercrimes and market volatility\u2014public and private organizations across sectors are considering new regulations.\n\nThe European Union, for example, is advancing a law known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), which would create a new regulatory regime to improve crypto financial tracking systems and legal compliance. The International Monetary Fund also recently released a 9-point guide on the handling of crypto assets for member countries. The guidelines are far from agreed upon, according to experts, but aim to provide an initial policy framework for governments.\n\nIn January, the World Economic Forum unveiled a DAO Toolkit that outlines how law-makers and entrepreneurs can engage with the growing DAO ecosystem. The toolkit outlines recommendations on DAO voting processes, governance procedures and legal frameworks.\n\n\u201cAlthough DAOs today manage billions of dollars\u2019 worth of assets, engage millions of contributors and operate across industries as diverse as finance and philanthropy, basic questions regarding operations, governance, law and policy are only just beginning to be addressed by policy-makers, regulators and entrepreneurs,\u201d the report notes."

        "title": "Silicon Valley Bank collapse: Crypto advocates call out 'opaque' financial system - Euronews",
        "content": "The Silicon Valley Bank collapse shows cryptocurrency and blockchain are superior technology for running the financial system, say crypto advocates.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the biggest bank failure in the US since the 2008 global recession, set off panic around the world as governments tried to assess its impact on tech start-ups, other financial institutions and even pension funds.\n\nBut crypto executives and investors - who have endured an extremely volatile market over the past year - seized on the moment to say \u201cI told you so\u201d.\n\n\u201cA lot of us believe that cryptocurrency and blockchain are superior technology for running the financial system,\u201d said Brad Nickel, who hosts the crypto podcast Mission: DeFi.\n\n\u201cSilicon Valley Bank, FTX, the mortgage crisis of 2008, [they all become] an opportunity to point out that our financial system that we all everywhere in the world rely upon is opaque and centrally controlled by human beings,\u201d he told Euronews Next.\n\n\u201cRegulators, investors, and banks could have seen how badly things were being run. The same is true of Silicon Valley Bank. We had no insights into what their financial situation was except for what they reported\u201d.\n\nBlockchain transactions are more transparent\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s first decentralised currency, \u201cwas designed precisely because of bank collapses in 2008,\u201d said Joe Donnelly, head of marketing at NiceHash, the leading cryptocurrency platform for mining.\n\n\u201cThe SVB collapse highlights how Bitcoin is important to the economy; it provides an alternative to the banking system where you don't have to rely on someone else doing things that you're not necessarily even aware of,\u201d he told Euronews Next.\n\nWhen politicians and regulators speak against crypto, they \u201ceither don't understand how the system functions and the power and transparency it gives [them] to catch scammers before they do something wrong or, they're being disingenuous because they're concerned about the loss of control in the financial sector for governments,\u201d Nickel added.\n\nThe counter-crypto defence\n\nDespite the growing list of crypto supporters jumping to scold and shame financiers, critics of the crypto space have not hesitated to point out how a crypto-centric version of Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s failure would have been much worse.\n\nIn the coming days, the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will refund SVB\u2019s depositors up to $250,000 (\u20ac206,000) while overseeing a process to recover the lost funds. The US government has also stepped in to prevent more bank runs.\n\nBitcoin and altcoin advocates, on the other hand, would have no saviour to come and support them if the crypto system collapses.\n\n\u201cWe've never had to have a bailout. We've never had to have the government come in and save people because the system worked the way it was supposed to,\u201d Nickel said.\n\nIf a protocol is failing, if developers are doing something wrong, \u201cthe system knows, the people know, they can all see it and can be alerted,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cSo, when you invest money, you're investing in something that is completely clear to be seen. And you can find out beforehand if something is going wrong,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cRegulators don't have that power now\u201d.\n\nTwo banks with strong crypto-focused failed. Why?\n\nIt also didn't take long for crypto critics to point fingers at the many crypto-friendly venture capital funds Silicon Valley Bank had. Likewise, Silvergate Capital and Signature - two other American banks that also failed last week - also had a strong strong crypto focus.\n\nNickel and Downie concur that the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX and trading house Alameda Research in November 2022 could have played a role in the failure of these crypto-focused banks.\n\n\"I think probably this was the fallout from all the FTX\u2026 there was so much money involved in it,\" said Downie.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The impacts from that were certainly being felt. You had a lot of start-ups in the crypto space who had their deposits in Silvergate, a lot of investors,\" Nickel added.\n\nThe FTX crash exposed an $8 billion hole (\u20ac7.5 billion) in its accounts, and more than a million people were reportedly affected by the collapse.\n\nBut the collapse was not crypto\u2019s fault, Nickel is quick to clarify.\n\nFTX bought and sold cryptocurrencies, but the problem was their financial backing: their bank accounts were opaque.\n\n\"A lot of people trusted what they were doing and trusted that they had the funds that they were supposed to have\u2026 but what they did, did not happen in the open, transparently for the world to see,\" he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere is another caveat that is important to understand: Silvergate Bank ran a traditional finance system trying to deal with a different financial model that does \"not necessarily share the same nature and behaviour\".\n\nBecause of the very volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, \u201cpeople in this space are more likely to move money more rapidly than would happen in the traditional banking sector; because we're so used to being able to move our money,\u201d says Nickel.\n\nAnd the banks are not used to these rapid fluctuations, so they panic, they fall, and then ultimately also hurt crypto.\n\n\"Despite the fact that cryptocurrencies are not centralised, they are still conditioned by the market\u2026 And initially, they went down because people still panic,\" said Downie. \"But then they've bounced back quite strong\".\n\nWas Signature Bank seized to send a message about crypto?\n\nThere is another possible rationale behind the collapse of crypto-friendly banks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn Tuesday, Barney Frank, a former member of the US Congress who was on Signature\u2019s board said the regulatory takeover of the New York-based bank was intended to send a message to other US banks to stay away from the cryptocurrency business.\n\nHe said that despite a wave of withdrawals, the bank\u2019s situation was under control before regulators swooped in.\n\n\"This was just a way to tell people, \u2018We don\u2019t want you dealing with crypto,\u2019\u201d Frank said in an interview with the Associated Press.\n\nNickel says he is not a big believer in conspiracy theories, \"but when somebody like Barney Frank says something like that, I start to pay attention. And that, to me, is very concerning\"."

        "title": "BTC is not Bitcoin: Why that matters to the SEC - CoinGeek",
        "content": "SEC Chair Gary Gensler recently reiterated the SEC\u2019s longstanding position that as far as they are concerned, Bitcoin is not a security, while most other digital assets are. Gensler didn\u2019t say that BTC or BCH aren\u2019t securities: he said that Bitcoin is not a security, specifically thanks to the unique circumstances of its creation and issuance.\n\nWhich of course begs the question: what is that original Bitcoin? And where does Gensler\u2019s assessment leave the many forks that have branched off the original since its creation? Most importantly, why does any of this matter, legally or otherwise?\n\nThe term Bitcoin refers to a networking and database protocol described and published under the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym in 2008. The system which adheres to that description is Bitcoin: any system which does not, is not.\n\nAs Gensler acknowledged to NY Mag, Bitcoin is viewed differently from other digital asset networks because of its unique origin story. Satoshi Nakamoto issued all 21 million Bitcoin in January 2009, and specified a fixed algorithmic system that governs the circumstances under which coins are released ie Proof-of-Work mining by nodes. No coins were pre-mined and Satoshi, the issuer, has no input in the release of these coins beyond the initial design of the system. As soon as the entire issuance was complete Satoshi was only as able to get Bitcoin the same way anyone else was: by getting in line and mining.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the protocol underpinning Bitcoin was always designed to be fixed and not subject to revision (\u201cThe nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime,\u201d wrote Satoshi Nakamoto in June 2010).\n\nThese circumstances matter because of how securities are defined: whether or not a digital asset offering amounts to a security is governed by the Howey test. Under Howey, an offering will be a security if:\n\nThere is an investment of money\n\nThe investment is made into a common enterprise\n\nThe investment is made with the reasonable expectation of profits\n\nThat expectation of profits is reliant on the efforts of others\n\nThe lack of any pre-mine by Satoshi is important, because the courts have interpreted pre-mining as a signal to investors that the issuer \u2018is motivated to work tirelessly to improve the value of its blockchain\u2019 for itself and purchasers (see SEC v LBRY). In other words, it is taken as a sign that investment was made with a reasonable expectation of profits reliant on the efforts of the issuer. The algorithmic process governing the release of coins without input from the original issue matters because under those circumstances, it can\u2019t be said that there is any common enterprise capable of investment: the nodes of the network are acting competitively.\n\nThat the protocol is fixed also matters: constant revisions to the protocol require centralized control that is exercised by some defined group. Absent centralization of that kind, it\u2019s very difficult to argue that any sort of investment in Bitcoin was done with the expectation of profits reliant on the efforts of others. Add that control in, and not only is a given asset offering highly likely to amount to a security, but the developers are also likely to be acting as fiduciaries toward those using their blockchains: see recent commentary from the U.K. Court of Appeal in Tulip Trading v Van der Laan and Ors or Angela Walch\u2019s much-cited paper, \u201cIn Code(rs) We Trust: Software Developers as Fiduciaries in Public Blockchains\u201d.\n\nSo, when Gensler says that Bitcoin is not a security or refers to its unique history, this is what he is referring to. This was the legal character of Bitcoin as it existed in 2009 and continues to exist in 2023 as Bitcoin SV.\n\nWhere does that leave BTC, BCH and similar knock-offs?\n\nThe term Bitcoin can only refer to a system that adheres to the white paper. Any deviation from the protocol described by Satoshi Nakamoto in that document is no longer Bitcoin, because the original Bitcoin protocol was designed to be fixed and not subject to revision. The fixed nature of the protocol is a key pillar in Bitcoin\u2019s ability to serve as peer to peer electronic cash and its ability to serve the needs of businesses: a protocol that is fixed can be embraced and relied upon by businesses and builders indefinitely, without the threat of regular changes to the fundamental protocol threatening to break all that relies on it. To illustrate, consider the TCP/IP protocol governing the internet: that protocol has remained fixed since inception, which has enabled the development and flourishing of the application level above it. If the underlying TCP/IP protocol were subject to constant revision, then the applications build atop it would need to be modified or even discarded each time. If that were the case, the world would not have been able to rely on, for example, email as the indispensable communications platform that it has remained for decades. The same can be said for Bitcoin: a fixed and unchanging underlying protocol is required if Bitcoin and all of its capabilities are to be relied on in business and everyday life.\n\nDespite all this, Satoshi\u2019s decision to hand off development to others in 2010 has led to attempts to change the underlying protocol of Bitcoin. This occurred despite the fact that Nakamoto remains the steward of the protocol and the issuer of all Bitcoin in existence. These changes have resulted in a number of \u2018forks\u2019 away from the original protocol, and though such forks have attempted to retain (illegally, it turns out) the Bitcoin name, they are not Bitcoin.\n\nChief among these offshoots is BTC, or Bitcoin Core. This offshoot was created by the core of developers who seized control of Bitcoin following Satoshi\u2019s exit and implemented a number of centrally-planned changes to the protocol which break from the Bitcoin defined in the white paper.\n\nThe most radical of these early changes was the SegWit update in 2017, which took the extraordinary step of removing digital signatures from Bitcoin transactions and putting them in a separate data structure in order to (ostensibly) help Bitcoin scale alongside an ever-growing number of transactions without increasing the cap on block size. In reality, this didn\u2019t help scaling at all (the so-called \u2018problem\u2019 of scaling is little more than a myth, as demonstrated by the original vision for Bitcoin which scales perfectly without any hard cap on block size) and only served the developers in charge, as it pushed users of the network off-chain and towards Lightning Network, a second-layer commercial solution owned by those very same devs.\n\nThe change was a radical departure from Bitcoin: the white paper makes clear both that signatures are an inextricable part of the system and that Bitcoin was always meant to scale on-chain via a fixed protocol. To move data off-chain in an effort to scale is to somewhat defeat the purpose of Bitcoin, which is to create a system of secure peer to peer electronic cash that is public. Moving that data onto a layer 2 network is a solution to a problem entirely of the devs own making (the imposition of an arbitrary block size) with the added benefit (to some) of obscuring the authors of transactions made with Bitcoin.\n\nEach significant departure from that protocol has two related effects: the chain \u2018forks\u2019 so that newly changed protocol splits from the original Bitcoin protocol, and there is created a new coin issuance based on the new protocol whereby the new coins are \u2018airdropped\u2019 to holders of the original. So, for example, when the SegWit update created a fork and split off from Bitcoin, every Bitcoin holder was airdropped the new, covertly issued BTC coin. Attorney and tech commentator Zeming Gao put it best in his recent article, \u201cEven BTC is a security according to the Howey test\u201d:\n\n\u201cEvery time when the actual underlying blockchain changes the base protocol that not only affects transactions but also affects the automated unilateral contract originally offered by Satoshi, the coin is no longer the original coin. From that point on, any coin that continues on the changed blockchain is materially a new coin offered under a new contract. Further, the continuous issuance of new tokens to miners is also under a new mining contract different from the original unilateral contract offered to miners by Satoshi. This makes the reissued tokens and new tokens both a security, collectively or separately, even though the original bitcoin was a nonsecurity. It does not matter what name or ticker it carries, nor what the market price it receives. This is because the market is not the factfinder for this matter; it simply votes according to whatever information it was fed, and in this case they were fed deceptive information.\u201d\n\nThe most important implication here is that just as these changes fork away from the original definition of Bitcoin, so to do they fork away from the original, SEC-compliant issuance. In other words, none of the factors which ensured that Bitcoin is not a security apply to the forks. The consequence is that these subsequent issuances amount to illegal, unregistered securities offerings. Which means that at any point, these systems are liable to be hit with an SEC enforcement action the likes of which killed LBRY and XRP.\n\nThere\u2019s another giant reason this should matter to anyone holding one of these forks: the taxman. BSV is the continuation of the original protocol, but the likes of BCH and BTC are forks. Each time a chain undergoes a hard fork in response to some network change, the forked coin is airdropped to all of the holders of the original. This airdrop is considered income by the IRS and is therefore taxable as such. This position was confirmed explicitly by the IRS in 2014 via Notice 2014-21. Which means holders of Bitcoin at the time it was forked into BTC (August 2017) and BCH (November 2018) owe income tax on the airdropped coins entailed by the fork:\n\n\u201cA hard fork occurs when a cryptocurrency undergoes a protocol change resulting in a permanent diversion from the legacy distributed ledger. This may result in the creation of a new cryptocurrency on a new distributed ledger in addition to the legacy cryptocurrency on the legacy distributed ledger. If your cryptocurrency went through a hard fork, but you did not receive any new cryptocurrency, whether through an airdrop (a distribution of cryptocurrency to multiple taxpayers\u2019 distributed ledger addresses) or some other kind of transfer, you don\u2019t have taxable income.\u201d\n\nEven ignoring the concerns of the SEC and IRS, those responsible for these drastic departures from the Bitcoin protocol and the continued misuse of the Bitcoin name are discovering that their actions have profound legal consequences. A number of individuals and entities who have been using the Bitcoin name to market these unrelated products have been hit with passing off claims in the U.K. potentially worth billions: those being sued include the individual developers of BTC but also those members of the broader ecosystem who enable the misuse of the Bitcoin name: companies like Coinbase and Kraken, who continually promote BTC as Bitcoin despite the fact that BTC bears little to no resemblance to the system described in the white paper. The developers are also discovering that their exercise of centralized control over their knock-off protocols have enormous legal consequences: they may well be proven to owe fiduciary duties to those who use their networks which would compel them to, among other things, return access to stolen digital assets to their rightful owners.\n\nIt must have seemed no big deal to hijack the original Bitcoin and transform it into something else entirely, but as Gensler and the deluge of lawsuits these hijackers are now facing demonstrate, such actions have severe legal consequences.\n\nWatch: The Future World with Blockchain\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is setting up a classic trading move, which could see it hit $100,000, one analyst says.\n\nIn a tweet on March 14, Charles Edwards, founder and CEO of investment firm Capriole, called BTC price action in 2023 a \u201cbump & run reversal.\u201d\n\nEdwards on BTC price: The \u201cbottom is back\u201d\n\nHaving passed $26,000 to hit new nine-month highs this week, BTC/USD is in the midst of a recovery rarely seen before.\n\nDespite cooling under $25,000 at the time of writing, longer timeframes are already getting analysts excited after the brutal 2022 bear market.\n\nFor Edwards, Bitcoin in 2023 has been straight out of the market\u2019s textbooks. The largest cryptocurrency is attempting to fulfill a \u201cbump and run reversal pattern,\u201d he believes.\n\nThe bottom phase of bump and run is defined by investment resource Wealthy Education as follows:\n\n\u201cThe bump-and-run reversal bottom is a bullish reversal pattern that begins with a series of descending peaks. Excessive speculation drives prices down until reaching extreme lows. The price action then reverses direction to the upside and marks the end of the downtrend.\u201c\n\n\u201cTextbook perfect Bitcoin \u2018Bump & Run Reversal\u2019 bottom is back and the target is over $100,000.\u201d Edwards summarized.\n\nAccompanying charts described the bump and run phenomenon, showing BTC/USD in the latter stages of its trend break and cementing a key resistance/support flip.\n\nWhat happens next \u2014 the so-called \u201cuphill run\u201d \u2014 gives the pair a six-figure target.\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Charles Edwards/ Twitter\n\nNonetheless, Edwards acknowledged that, like any chart pattern, bump and run might \u201cfail\u201d and should not be used as the basis for a trading or investment strategy.\n\nKey Bitcoin price resistance ahead\n\nFor others, sky-high BTC price valuations remain a fantasy.\n\nRelated: Fed starts \u2018stealth QE\u2019 \u2014 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week\n\nDirectly above the current spot price lies an area of heavy resistance that Bitcoin bulls have failed to overcome so far. Key moving averages (MAs) on weekly timeframes likewise remain unchallenged.\n\n\u201cBest case scenario for BTC is to break the 200 MA on this current move,\u201d trader and analyst Rekt Capital argued about the current interplay between BTC/USD and the 200-week MA.\n\nHe showed that previous rejections had delivered double-figure losses.\n\n\u201cClearly, the 200 MA is weakening as resistance. However, what if the 200 MA rejections are declining by 10% each time?\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cIf BTC fails to break the 200 MA soon, could BTC reject by -12%?\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart.

If price does need to drop down to generate enough momentum to take the next leg up to $30,000, the 1D support at $21,800 is a clear target. But for now 4H support is holding well at $23,900,\u201d Miffy concluded.\n\n\u201cImportantly though, we have seen a major narrative shift for Bitcoin with a clear breakaway from traditional markets which continue to struggle due to their economic troubles and bank blow-ups.

        "content": "Digital artifacts have come to Bitcoin, essentially breaking Ethereum and Solana\u2019s virtual duopoly on NFTs. But many have expressed their disdain for the technology based on inventor Casey Rodarmor\u2019s Ordinal protocol. And with good reason.\n\nOrdinals\u2019 inscription feature enables storage and tracking of NFT content on the BTC blockchain, but as industry observer \u201cBitcoin is Saving\u201d notes, \u201cjust because you can, doesn\u2019t mean you should.\u201d\n\nIndeed. Ethereum, with its proof-of-stake model, is much better positioned and equipped to accommodate the NFT industry and support responsible artists as they explore the next frontier of the new cultural economy.\n\nEthereum\u2019s code change to Proof of Stake enabled its validation process to use 99.95% less energy than a Proof of Work (PoW) protocol, like that used for Bitcoin transactions. By reducing the electricity needed to validate a transaction, Ethereum severed the lifeline PoW blockchain platforms provide to climate-destroying fossil fuel power plants used by Bitcoin miners. NFT artists now have a clear technology option that doesn\u2019t contribute to climate pollution.\n\nThe virtual reality artist known as Sutu, for example, leverages the resources that enable creativity to flourish around evolving technology while embracing global equity and environmental stewardship.\n\nIn championing the conscious crypto creator movement, Sutu highlights the social and financial viability of sustainable and transparent NFT practices. His limited-edition Neonz collection of 10,000 retro-futuristic avatars on Tezos sold for around a million dollars while publicizing clean NFT practices and demonstrating innovative avenues the arts community can follow to harness technology in the pursuit of sustainability.\n\nOrdinals give serial numbers to satoshis, Bitcoin\u2019s micro fractional currency, making them unique and non-fungible. Creators can then inscribe a satoshi with digital content \u2014 a picture, scanned document, video clip, etc. Moreover, by taking advantage of the cryptocurrency\u2019s Taproot and Segregated Witness features, these inscriptions can be as large as 4 megabytes, certainly large enough to accommodate these media. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nThe Rolling Stone Culture Council is an invitation-only community for Influencers, Innovators and Creatives. Do I qualify?\n\nThat\u2019s where much of the problem arises.\n\nBitcoin originally was intended to facilitate financial transactions only, and it has done an effective job of carrying out this task. But flooding the BTC blockchain with bulky, cumbersome NFTs causes several critical problems:\n\n1. It threatens to lock \u201csmall blockers\u201d who rely on the chain\u2019s limited scale to eke out revenues and small profits.\n\nThese players often are part of cottage industries in disadvantaged communities who cannot hope to compete with syndicates and Bitcoin pools to mine the larger blocks. As Bitcoin is Saving observed, \u201cmarginalized peoples in developing countries will have to pay more to run their Bitcoin nodes and send transactions.\u201d For example, a few days after the launch of Ordinal inscriptions, Luxor mined a block weighing in at 3.96 MB. While many blocks can grow to that size given thousands of financial transactions, this one contained only 63 because one is a 3.94 MB digital image.\n\n2. It obliterates Bitcoin\u2019s original intent.\n\nIf often-frivolous NFT projects grow legs on the Bitcoin blockchain, they may clog the entire process of precious bandwidth. Think of NFT inscriptions as farm tractors on the freeway. They take up multiple lanes and move slowly. Smaller financial transactions, which the chain was built and intended to serve, get stuck in the queue and cannot get around the lumbering traffic in front of it. They must bide their time until the tractor reaches its destination and pulls off the road. As the Luxor example shows, a single block could accommodate more than 10,000 financial transactions or one NFT.\n\nRelated\n\n3. It can cause costs to rise.\n\nBecause Ordinal inscriptions are performed, conducted and stored on Bitcoin\u2019s main network, the added congestion will put pressure on the supply of miners\u2019 ability to record data efficiently. Keeping these assets on-chain is a low-return use of resources that will drive up fees and transaction costs. And because NFT inscriptions will draw bigger payoffs, miners will likely favor them over the recording or financial dealings. Merchants, investors and other stakeholders will either have to match the higher NFT fees or be left behind.\n\n4. It opens the door to spam, bloatware, malicious data and socially unredeeming \u201cartifacts.\u201d\n\nRodarmor already has been forced to acknowledge this drawback and scramble to remove an extreme pornographic inscription from the front page of Ordinal\u2019s website. The offending satoshi, which was on the site for about 30 minutes, has been taken down but the image can never be expunged. Trending Kristen Stewart Uncensored: 'I Want to Do the Gayest Thing You've Ever Seen in Your Life' The Royals Have Totally Lost Control of the Narrative Andrew Tate Was Arrested After Adin Ross Blabbed About His Escape Plans GOP Senate Candidate Took Bold Stance Against the Sale of Alcohol ... in Wisconsin\n\nOpening Bitcoin to NFTs compounds the blockchain\u2019s already difficult path to scaling and facilitating adoption. Legitimate financial transactions will feel the pinch as large NFT nodes soak up the available space and squeeze small miners and nodes out of the most profitable workflows.\n\nThe inscription practice also brings into question Bitcoin\u2019s fungibility and anonymity. If a few satoshis contain NFTs that fluctuate in value, they are different from their peers. Making some of the several satoshis unique could allow them to be easily traced, removing privacy protection, which is one of the blockchain\u2019s most valuable assets."

In the past, any strong risk-off move has seen Bitcoin turn lower, but not this time. The cryptocurrency space as a whole has moved higher over the last week, driven by a growing view that a failing bank system reinforces the view that a peer-to-peer digital currency is in part immune to traditional banking woes.\n\nThe current market resilience can also be traced back to the FTX/Alameda meltdown in mid-November. Bitcoin hit a low of $15,487 a couple of days later, but since then BTC has pushed further ahead and despite the late-February sell-off, it is now within a few percent of making a fresh multi-month high. It seems Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency space as a whole is becoming increasingly resilient to both defi and tradfi shocks.\n\nCryptocurrency Meltdown Pauses After FTX and Alameda Implosion\n\nBitcoin is now pressing against a level of resistance around $25.2k that has not been broken convincingly for months. While Tuesday\u2019s rally took BTC to an intra-day peak of just under $26.4k, it closed around $24.6k. For BTC to make fresh gains, and the path to an eventual target of $32k looks possible, it needs to close and open above this resistance to confirm the move. All three moving averages are supportive, with the 200-dma providing strong support during last week\u2019s sell-off, while the CCI indicator shows BTC trading in overbought territory. A few more days of consolidation and then a fresh push higher may be on the cards.\n\nBitcoin (BTC/USD) Daily Price Chart \u2013 March 16, 2023\n\nChart via TradingView\n\nWhat is your view on Bitcoin \u2013 bullish or bearish??

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) received a substantial boost this week as United States inflation levels for February were in line with market expectations. On March 14, the BTC/USD pair surged to a 2023 peak at $26,550 after the news.\n\nBut, while the macroeconomic conditions may currently favor risk-on buyers, certain on-chain and market indicators hint at a potential correction in the near term.\n\nBTC flows back to exchanges as price rises\n\nOn March 13, Glassnode\u2019s exchange flow data recorded the most significant inflow to exchanges since May 2022. This means more supply on exchanges and potentially higher selling pressure.\n\nThe coin days destroyed indicator, which measures the time-weighted transfers of Bitcoin, also shows a small spike, indicating that old hands are moving coins. The indicators might signal profit booking by long-term holders, which can lead to a correction.\n\nBitcoin exchange netflow volume. Source: Glassnode\n\nBitcoin funding rates, RSI jump\n\nMoreover, the funding rate for Bitcoin perpetual swaps is also elevated with the latest Consumer Price Index print. In other words, more traders are betting on the upside with leveraged positions, increasing the risk of a correction.\n\nFunding rate for Bitcoin perpetual contracts. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe sharp price movement has also recorded a significant spike in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a technical momentum indicator, with a reading of as high as 82. This means that BTC/USD is generally considered \u201coverbought\u201d in the short term.\n\nBTC vs. USD painting a bearish pattern\n\nBTC price is currently forming a broadening wedge pattern, which depicts the heightened level of volatility. Both buyers and sellers are pushing the price beyond support and resistance levels, with the reversals coming quickly.\n\nBTC/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBuyers failed to stage a pattern breakout on March 14, and are now facing resistance at its ceiling of $26,700. At the same time, there is a chance that the price will correct back toward the bottom of the pattern, around $19,500, in the coming days.\n\nOn the contrary, if Bitcoin\u2019s price breaks above the top trendline, the bulls will likely pile in to push the price toward $30,000. There are potentially welcome signs for the bulls that this could happen \u2014 namely in the BTC options and futures markets.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, there\u2019s still room to run, as the indicators have yet to reach previous peak levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "How to Create a Bitcoin Ordinal - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Ordinals are akin to Bitcoin NFTs. In this guide, we\u2019ll show you how to inscribe one to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nOver the last few months, Ordinals (Bitcoin NFTs) have gone from a niche interest among a small group of Bitcoiners to a fast-growing technology that\u2019s captured the attention of collectors, traders, developers, and creators across crypto ecosystems. Usage has hockey-sticked during winter 2022-2023, culminating in Yuga Labs\u2019 March 2023 \u201cTwelvefold\u201d Ordinals auction that netted 735 BTC ($16.5 million at the time of auction). That event included participation from top ETH collectors, many of whom are spinning up full Bitcoin nodes for the first time in their lives.\n\nWhether Ordinals mature into a small, differentiated corner of the NFT world, or a deca-billion-dollar asset class sparking a new renaissance in Bitcoin development and adoption, remains to be seen \u2014 but Ordinals are here to stay.\n\nWhat Are Ordinals?\n\nThe quick answer is that Ordinals are Bitcoin NFTs. The longer answer is that when people commonly refer to Ordinals, they are actually referring to a unique combination of the following:\n\nAn inscription : Fully on-chain data (e.g., an image or text) plus associated metadata shoved into Bitcoin blocks through \u201cinscribing.\u201d\n\nAn ordinal : A single satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin), which is unique and non-fungible, enabled by a novel convention called Ordinal Theory , implemented in a piece of open-source software called Ord (released by creator Casey Rodarmor in December 2022).\n\nAn \u201cOrdinal,\u201d or Bitcoin NFT, is created at the end of a process that starts with putting data on-chain (inscription) and ends with mapping the data to a non-fungible satoshi using Ordinal Theory.\n\nThe main difference between Ordinals and NFTs on other chains is that content data (inscriptions) on Ordinals are always stored on Bitcoin; NFTs on other chains are mostly pointers to actual data that live off-chain (e.g., on Arweave, IPFS). The main similarity is that both are viewable, collectable, tradeable, and creatable. This guide will specifically explore how to create them.\n\nWhile anyone can create an Ordinal on their own, the process is onerous for casual users because it requires the following:\n\nDownloading and syncing a full node\n\nDownloading the ord wallet\n\nExecuting commands via command line\n\nInstead, we\u2019ll focus on how to inscribe Ordinals quickly using existing services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Get an Ordinals-Compatible Wallet (Or Two)\n\nPopular Ordinals-compatible wallets include graphical user interface (GUI) wallets like Sparrow (instructions here) or web wallets like Unisat, Oyl, or Xverse (requires STX). For this guide, we\u2019ll assume you\u2019re using Sparrow.\n\nTip: Think twice before using a custodial wallet where you have to trust a third party with your keys. As Bitcoiners say: not your keys, not your coins.\n\nStep 2: Get Some BTC\n\nYou\u2019ll need BTC to pay fees to the inscription service you use. You can pay the fee from any wallet with BTC in it. Inscription costs vary based on fee markets and data size, but for a typical JPG (and if you\u2019re not in a rush), budgeting around $50 per inscription should be more than enough.\n\nTip: To be safe, don\u2019t send the BTC to an address where you plan to receive your Ordinal. Maintaining a separate address will prevent you from accidentally sending your Ordinal out. For instance, in this example, it\u2019s OK to pay the inscription fee from any Bitcoin wallet (e.g., Ledger Live, Blue Wallet, Coinbase), but you should make sure to receive the inscription only to the receiving address generated in Sparrow.\n\nStep 3: Pick an Inscription Service\n\nInscription services are run by third parties and enable you to inscribe and receive your Ordinal via a friendly-to-use interface (for a fee). Popular inscription services as of this writing include:\n\nThe next steps assume you\u2019re using Ordinalsbot to inscribe, but other inscription services work similarly.\n\nStep 4: Upload Your Content\n\nChoose which file type you want to inscribe and drag and drop your desired data \u2014 such as an image, video, or music \u2014 into the upload box.\n\nStep 5: Input the Receive Address for Your Ordinal\n\nIn the \u201cReceive BTC Address\u201d field on the inscription site, input the receive address you want the Ordinal sent to.\n\nIn a correctly configured Sparrow wallet, click \u201cGet Next Address\u201d to generate a new receive address for the Ordinal you are inscribing. Make sure to use a fresh address for each Ordinal. Do not send multiple Ordinals to the same address. Label the address with something you\u2019ll recognize as belonging to the inscription you\u2019re about to do.\n\nImportant: Outside of Ordinals-native wallets, do not send or receive Ordinals in your normal Bitcoin wallet or exchange account. Your Ordinals may be lost forever if you do this. Until wallets explicitly supporting Ordinals launch, the safest way to receive Ordinals is via your correctly configured Sparrow (GUI) or Ord (command line) wallet.\n\nStep 6: Pay Fees\n\nYou\u2019ll need to pay a network fee (to Bitcoin miners) and a service fee (to the inscription service). If the service allows you to set a custom fee, like Ordinalsbot does, input your desired fee; higher is generally faster and lower is slower.\n\nTip: If you go too low on the network fee, your inscription might take a long time or not be included at all.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve selected the network fee, pay the invoice by scanning the QR code or copying the receive address into the wallet you\u2019re sending BTC from. Make sure to pay the correct amount.\n\nStep 7: Wait for the Inscription to Complete\n\nOn Ordinalsbot, you can check the status of your inscription by looking up your order ID:\n\nStep 8: Confirm Receipt of Your Ordinal\n\nDepending on network congestion, your fee payment, and the inscription service, your new, shiny Ordinal should show up at some point at the receive address you inputted in Step 5. Here\u2019s what that looks like in Sparrow:\n\nStep 9: Validate and Look Up Your Ordinal/Inscription\n\nTo look up your Ordinal / inscription, copy the transaction output associated with the Ordinal you just received:\n\nPaste it into the search bar at Ordinals.com or another Ordinals-compatible explorer:\n\nStep 10: You\u2019re Done\n\nCongratulations on inscribing your Ordinal!\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nHere are some links to get started:"

        "content": "Affiliate disclaimer: Please note that some links on Bitcoin Market Journal are affiliate links. If you click and make a purchase or open an account we may receive a commission. This is at no cost to you, but helps to support the growth of BMJ.\n\nThere are multiple ways to buy bitcoin, but perhaps the easiest and safest way is through an exchange like Coinbase. This article will show you how to buy bitcoin on this popular exchange. When you\u2019re ready you can get started right here.\n\nLaunched in 2012, Coinbase is a popular site for crypto investors, primarily because it is easy to use. Coinbase reports over 110 million verified users \u2013 that\u2019s more than Charles Schwab, with 33.6 million active brokerage accounts.\n\nGetting Started\n\nHere is what you need before you get started:\n\nA valid email address\n\nA valid photo ID (such as a driver\u2019s license)\n\nA bank account or credit card\n\nCoinbase has no minimum account size. That means you can buy bitcoin at Coinbase and then ship it to your private wallet, leaving a zero account balance at Coinbase if you like. Perhaps the safest way to hold bitcoin is in your own private wallet, in case the exchange gets hacked.\n\nYou will need valid identification, such as a driver\u2019s license or photo ID. You will upload your ID directly on the Coinbase website. For security purposes, Coinbase does not allow you to send your ID by email.\n\nYou also need a bank account or credit card to make purchases. During due diligence, Coinbase will send a few pennies to your bank account; then you must verify the amount to Coinbase. All this is for verification and authentication purposes. Like any bank or money transmitter, Coinbase must comply with Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering laws.\n\nOpen Your Coinbase Account\n\nOnce you are ready to sign up for an account, go to the account signup page, where you will see this:\n\nSimply fill in the required fields to open your account. You will be prompted to upload your ID and verify your bank account or credit card as you go. Simply follow the prompts as they appear to complete account set up.\n\nOnce you have opened an account at Coinbase, you will see a dashboard with the price of bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and other coins listed, along with your current balance of each coin and the market\u2019s top movers.\n\nBuying Bitcoin\n\nTo buy bitcoin, scroll up to the top of the main Coinbase page and click on Buy/Sell. A screen will pop up that looks like this:\n\nYou can specify a dollar amount of bitcoin you want and by clicking the \u201cPreview Buy\u201d button you can see the amount of BTC you would receive for that amount. In this case, the purchase is for $100 worth of bitcoin or 0.00428171 BTC.\n\nYou will see the order to buy 0.01411305 BTC for $100, with a $2.99 Coinbase fee, which is 2.99 percent of the purchase price. The price of bitcoin was $22,656.84 at the time of the sale.\n\nHit \u201cBuy now\u201d Then you will see the confirmation of your purchase. Note that the amount of bitcoin purchased could be slightly different than on the preview screen as Coinbase is constantly updating the purchase based on the market price. In this case the preview showed 0.01411305 BTC for $100, however we ended up getting 0.01428165 BTC for $100 because the price of bitcoin dropped slightly in the 30 seconds or so it took to complete the transaction. This worked in our favor this time, but that might not always be the case.\n\nYou can always see the purchase by clicking on Bitcoin from your Home screen and then switching to the \u201cPrimary balance\u201d tab. It will show all the purchases made from your Coinbase account, how much BTC you received, and how much fiat you paid. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t show the fees paid, which would be a nice addition.\n\nSetting Up Recurring Buys\n\nOne approach to buying an investment with a fluctuating price like bitcoin is dollar cost averaging. Dollar cost averaging is buying a fixed amount every month to average in your cost basis. Dollar cost averaging works well for investors who are buying stocks or cryptocurrencies on a fixed monthly budget.\n\nCoinbase allows you to set up this kind of recurring transaction straight from your dashboard if you wish. Simply click the dropdown in the middle of the Buy/Sell page (it defaults to \u201cone time purchase\u201d but there are several options to choose from) and choose the frequency of your recurring purchase.\n\nConclusion\n\nCoinbase is a good way to get started with buying bitcoin and altcoins because of its ease of use. It also offers sales of Ethereum, Litecoin, and Cardano, as well as Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot. Overall, there are currently 172 assets available for trading, and 212 assets you could hold in the Coinbase wallet.\n\nYet Coinbase has limitations. Its fees are quite a bit higher than other exchanges. Also, Coinbase does not offer Ripple XRP or several other popular currencies like Tron and Dash. A review of other crypto trading sites can be found here.\n\nThe market is huge, with about 9,000 altcoins currently.

        "content": "Bitcoin Country seeks to generate world-class Bitcoin and Lightning engineers through a new program utilizing the university system.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Office has announced a new six month educational program entitled \u201cCUBO+\u201d that aims to produce elite-level Bitcoin and Lighting developers through the Salvadoran university system.\n\nAccording to the Office, the program, beginning in May, will consist of a relatively small group of students, under 25, narrowed down from some of the brightest students in El Salvador\u2019s universities. The first group will be through students at the University of Don Bosco. They will be competing for the inaugural Plan B Fellowship, funded by Tether and Fulgur Ventures. The project is a result of the recently announced agreement between El Salvador and Lugano, Switzerland for the world\u2019s first Bitcoin Embassy in the Swiss city.\n\nThe program will be led and taught by some of the brightest minds in Bitcoin who will be announced soon. Classes will range in topics from high-level technical development specific to Bitcoin, to distributed technologies such as Holepunch, Nostr and Web5. Private funding is responsible for the program, and all students who qualify for the Plan B Fellowship will receive a stipend in order for them to cover the costs of the course.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first two months of the program will be online, followed by a two week in-person bootcamp, featuring intense full-day courses located in San Salvador. The remaining months will include close online mentorship with the top names in Bitcoin.\n\nThe information shared with Bitcoin Magazine described how the program will become a framework upon which others can utilize as an open-source standard for high-level Bitcoin education. Educational experts are participating in the course design which promises to set the standard for other nations to follow.\n\nStudents who complete the course will be presented with various options for continuing their Bitcoin journey, including the option to take on a full-time job at reputable Bitcoin companies. Otherwise, entrepreneurial opportunities and continuing education will be available.\n\nThe name Cubo+ is derived from a project that President Nayib Bukele started in his Mayor position of San Salvador. When he was mayor, the city would erect buildings in areas that were impoverished, and these buildings served as libraries and community centers for furthering education. The program hopes to draw on this inspiration for building El Salvador\u2019s future.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin hash rate continues to rise, but DeFi is under threat: Report - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The beginning of 2023 raised hopes that the blockchain industry was on the path toward recovery, but weaker-than-hoped financial performance and a bout of negative news in February have cast doubts on this outlook. However, these headwinds do not affect all sectors of the industry uniformly. Nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and security tokens have managed to decouple from the broader environment and showed positive signs in February, but the rest of the market remains cautious.\n\nFor those serious about understanding the crypto space\u2019s various sectors, Cointelegraph Research publishes a monthly Investors Insights report that dives into venture capital, derivatives, decentralized finance (DeFi), regulation and much more. Compiled by leading experts on these various topics, the monthly reports are an invaluable tool to quickly get a sense of the current state of the blockchain industry.\n\nDownload and purchase this month\u2019s report on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.\n\nCan the mining industry consolidate its finances?\n\nThe bear market has witnessed multiple news stories about struggling miners, particularly publicly traded United States mining operations with high levels of debt that correspondingly suffered from lower Bitcoin (BTC) prices. However, the release of new, highly efficient mining hardware in 2022 \u2014 such as Bitmain\u2019s Antminer S19 Pro and S19 XP and Microbt\u2019s WhatsMiner M53 \u2014 has resulted in efficiency gains of up to 30%, according to data from Hashrate Index. Cointelegraph Research\u2019s August 2022 trends report pointed investors to the release of this new hardware and projected that the Bitcoin network\u2019s hash rate would rise as a result.\n\nSince August, the hash rate has indeed kept hitting new all-time highs despite the bearish market conditions, which traditionally cause a drop. Iris Energy has purchased 44,000 Antminer S19j Pro miners, with CleanSpark adding 20,000 S19j Pro+ miners to its arsenal as well. This is despite Iris Energy defaulting on debt obligations back in November.\n\nStaying ahead of the rest of the network is critical in the mining sector. Those who manage to raise capital and procure new electricity-saving hardware earlier than others will be able to turn significant profits before the difficulty catches up again. For miners that manage to raise this capital, there may be hope.\n\nIntensifying regulatory pressure on the DeFi sector\n\nMeanwhile, regulators are stepping up their enforcement actions and threatening the backbone of the DeFi sector. On Feb. 12, it was revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had initiated a crackdown on Paxos, a major stablecoin issuer. The SEC sent Paxos a Wells notice, informing the company of the regulator\u2019s intention to file a lawsuit against it for offering unregistered securities \u2014 and specifically referring to Binance USD (BUSD) as the security in question. In the aftermath of the notice, BUSD lost over 40% of its market capitalization.\n\nAs stablecoins provide safe ways for traders to take profits, this crackdown is a major threat to the industry. Many fear that Paxos will not remain the only target and that these actions will become widespread. Labeling stablecoins as securities is a surprising move by the SEC, given that there are no obvious expectations of profit from them.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the SEC\u2019s action will be followed up with similar steps against Tether and its USDT (USDT) stablecoin, which is allegedly being used by North Korea and Venezuela to evade sanctions. Other key developments in this area can be found in the Regulation and DeFi sections of this month\u2019s Investor Insights Report from Cointelegraph Research.\n\nThe Cointelegraph Research team\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s Research department comprises some of the best talents in the blockchain industry. Bringing together academic rigor and filtered through practical, hard-won experience, the researchers on the team are committed to bringing the most accurate, insightful content available on the market.\n\nDemelza Hays, Ph.D., is the director of research at Cointelegraph.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nHow have nearly 3,000 Africans adopted Bitcoin\u2014often called \u201cthe internet of money\u201d\u2014without actually having access to the internet?\n\nThe answer lies with Machankura, a tool built by software developer Kgothatso Ngako for using Bitcoin with nothing but a feature phone. No computer, smartphone, or internet service is required.\n\n\u201cI had set up a raspberry pi running both a Bitcoin and Lightning node and was trying to figure out what I could build on top of it,\u201d Ngako told Decrypt via direct message. \u201cA USSD project was intriguing because quite a lot of African Bitcoiners were already talking about building a wallet for feature phone users.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe challenge was accepted on Twitter.\n\nUSSD stands for Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, a protocol used in telecommunications networks for sending short text messages. It's similar to Interactive Voice Response, with which a mobile network operator\u2019s customer service might tell you which numbers to press for accessing a particular service, but in text form.\n\nWith Machankura, mobile phone users across a range of African countries can access the app by dialing a specific code, depending on their location and the service they wish to access. Its services include sending or receiving Bitcoin, checking one\u2019s balance, or even bartering Bitcoin for goods and services on Bitrefill.\n\n\n\nThe tool can even interact with the Lightning Network, a layer-2 payments system that enables instantaneous and virtually free Bitcoin transactions.\n\nNgako chose a UX solution called The Lightning Address to enable phone users to easily identify lightning addresses for both sending and receiving satoshis. Standard lightning invoices look like long random strings of text that must be copied and pasted, a function that feature phone users don\u2019t have.\n\n\n\nThe developer said there are now 2,900 people using Machankura, spread across 8 countries in which it is active: Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia. Going by figures previously posted from the app\u2019s Twitter page, that\u2019s a 10X increase since August.\n\nAs Bitcoin adoption grows, tools like Machankura could expand to serve an estimated 2.9 billion people on Earth who still lack internet access.\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe the tool could help \u2018Bitcoin the un-Bitcoined,\u2019\u201d opined Ngako. \u201cPayment technology is very dependent on network effects. Both receiver and sender need the ability to send and receive for the payment technology to be adopted.\u201d\n\n"

        "title": "Ethereum price reaches lowest level relative to Bitcoin in 5 months - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The previous six months should have been extremely beneficial to Ether\u2019s (ETH) price, especially following the project\u2019s most significant upgrade ever in September 2022. However, the reality was the opposite: Between Sept. 15, 2022 and March 15, 2023, Ether underperformed by 10% against Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nETH/BTC price ratio on Bitfinex, 2-day. Source: TradingView\n\nThe ETH/BTC price ratio of 0.068 had been holding since October 2022, a support that was broken on March 15. Whatever the reason for the underperformance, traders currently have little confidence in placing leverage bets, according to ETH futures and options data.\n\nBut first, one should consider why Ether\u2019s price was expected to rise in the previous six months. On Sept.15, 2022, the Merge \u2014 a hard fork that switched the network to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism \u2014 occurred. It enabled a much lower, even negative, coin issuing rate. But more importantly, the change paved the way for parallel processing that aimed to bring scalability and lower transaction costs to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Shapella hard fork, expected to take effect on the mainnet in April, is the next step in the Ethereum network upgrade. The change will allow validators who previously deposited 32 ETH to enter the staking mechanism to withdraw in part or in full. While this development is generally positive because it gives validators more flexibility, the potential 1.76 million ETH unlock is a negative consequence.\n\nHowever, there is a cap on the number of validators that can exit; therefore, the maximum daily unstake is 70,000 ETH. Moreover, after exiting the validation process, one may choose between Lido, Rocket Pool or a decentralized finance (DeFi) application for yield mechanisms. These coins will not necessarily be sold on the market.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the recent drop below the 0.068 ETH/BTC ratio has affected investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nETH futures recovered from a state of panic\n\nIn healthy markets, the annualized three-month futures premium should trade between 5% and 10% to cover associated costs and risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount (\u201cbackwardation\u201d) relative to traditional spot markets, it indicates traders\u2019 lack of confidence and is regarded as a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nDerivatives traders became uncomfortable holding leverage long (bull) positions as the Ether futures premium moved below zero on March 11, down from 3.5% just two days prior. More importantly, the current 2.5% premium remains modest and distant from the 5% neutral-to-bullish threshold.\n\nNonetheless, declining demand for leverage longs (bulls) does not necessarily imply an expectation of negative price action. As a result, traders should examine Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers price the likelihood of future price movements.\n\nRelated: Lark Davis on fighting social media storms, and why he\u2019s an ETH bull \u2014 Hall of Flame\n\nETH options confirm a lack of risk appetite\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign showing when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection. In bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 8%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -8%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nOn March 3, the delta skew crossed the bearish 8% threshold, indicating stress among professional traders. The fear levels peaked on March 10, when the price of Ether plummeted to $1,370, its lowest level in 56 days, although the price of ETH rebounded above $1,480 on March 12.\n\nSurprisingly, on March 12, the 25% delta skew metric continued to rise, reaching its highest level of skepticism since November 2022. It happened just hours before Ether\u2019s price rose 20% in 48 hours, which explains why ETH traders shorting futures contracts faced $507 million in liquidations.\n\nThe 3% delta skew metric currently signals a balanced demand for ETH call and put options. When combined with the neutral stance on the ETH futures premium, the derivatives market indicates that professional traders are hesitant to place either bullish or bearish bets. Unfortunately, ETH derivatives metrics do not favor traders expecting Ether to reclaim the 0.068 level against Bitcoin in the near term.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "title": "Ordinal Punks: All You Need to Know About the Bitcoin NFT Collection - NFTevening.com",
        "content": "In recent times, the world has witnessed a surge in the popularity of NFTs and the new possibilities they bring. While Ethereum has traditionally been the go-to platform for NFTs, the rise of Bitcoin NFTs has created a buzz in the NFT and crypto community. One unique digital collection created using the Bitcoin blockchain is the Ordinal Punks. The collection comprises 100 unique profile pictures (PFPs) that are minted within the first 650 inscriptions and fully on-chain on the Bitcoin blockchain. While they have become highly sought-after digital assets in the NFT space, there is some debate as to whether Ordinal Punks are true NFTs or not.\n\nIn this guide, we will explain everything you might want to know about Ordinal Punks, Bitcoin NFTs, and the controversy surrounding the collection.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin NFTs?\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s take a look at what Bitcoin NFTs actually are. In essence, Bitcoin NFTs are unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. Like other blockchain networks, the Bitcoin blockchain is a secure and decentralized network that records transactions. Casey Rodarmor, a software engineer, added the Ordinals protocol to the Bitcoin blockchain. Markedly, this protocol allows users and developers to add Ordinals to each of the 100,000,000 units that make up one Bitcoin. \u2018Sats\u2019 or \u2018satoshis\u2019 is the common term for these units. Moreover, this data can include smart contracts, which enable the creation of NFTs on the blockchain. Essentially, the Ordinals protocol provides a way for creators to build NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nWhat are Ordinal Punks NFTs?\n\nBasically, Ordinal Punks are a collection of Bitcoin NFTs. Notably, this collection pays tribute to CryptoPunks, an NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain. Each Ordinal Punk NFT is a one-of-a-kind digital artwork. The collection comprises 100 unique PFPs (profile pictures) that are minted within the first 650 inscriptions and fully on-chain on the Bitcoin blockchain. But, what exactly is an inscription? Essentially, inscriptions are digital artifacts, like an image or text, created on the protocol.\n\nHow Were Ordinal Punks Created?\n\nOrdinal Punks are a unique digital collection created using the Ordinals protocol. The collection is made within the first 650 inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain and was createed by the pseudonymous Web3 creator FlowStay. Additionally, each NFT is generated through an algorithmic process. This process uses a series of factors and results in a unique combination of colors, shapes, and patterns. Furthermore, the use of Bitcoin Ordinals provides each NFT with a permanent, verifiable identity on the Bitcoin blockchain, making it easily traceable and authenticated. Bitcoin\u2019s Segregated Witness, commonly known as SegWit, and Taproot upgrade made it possible to store NFT data on-chain. Significantly, this allows unlimited transaction sizes. To buy, sell, or trade an Ordinal Punk, users need to run a full node on the Bitcoin blockchain. This means that in order to do this, you\u2019d need to be crypto-savvy!\n\nHow Much are Ordinal Punks Worth?\n\nOrdinal Punks NFTs have become highly sought-after digital assets in the NFT space. They are priced roughly around $100,000, but one NFT, Punk 94, sold for a huge $214,000 or 9.5 BTC. Surprisingly, one NFT collector traded an original CryptoPunk for an Ordinal Punk, causing a stir in the NFT space. As CryptoPunks are often referred to as the first project in NFT history, many questioned whether the swap was a wise decision, even though the value of both projects was roughly the same at the time of the swap.\n\nHow are Ordinal Punks Valued?\n\nOrdinal Punks are valued based on various factors such as their rarity, uniqueness, historical significance, and demand from collectors. The market determines the price of an Ordinal Punk NFT, with some selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Additionally, the fact that Ordinal Punks are created using Bitcoin blockchain technology and have a permanent, verifiable identity also adds to their value. The value of an Ordinal Punk will likely fluctuate over time, based on market demand and other factors.\n\nSo, are Ordinal Punks NFTs or Not?\n\nCasey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals, said this in a blog post. \u201cInscriptions are digital artifacts, and digital artifacts are NFTs, but not all NFTs are digital artifacts. Digital artifacts are NFTs held to a higher standard, closer to their ideal.\u201d\n\nNFT enthusiasts, however, have a different opinion. Some argue that Ordinal Punks are not true NFTs because they lack programmability, which limits their potential uses. Trading the collection is also complex. Due to Bitcoin NFTs being still in its early stages, there is no infrastructure or marketplaces available to support it. Instead, users purchase the digital artifacts peer-to-peer over the counter via the Ordinal Punks Discord.\n\nThe Community Reacts\n\nGenerally, the concept of Bitcoin NFTs has caused a stir within the Web3 community. Bitcoin maximalists often reject the idea of using Bitcoin for anything other than financial transactions, such as creating NFTs. They believe that NFTs and other non-financial use cases of Bitcoin are not valuable and distract from Bitcoin\u2019s main purpose as a decentralized currency. However, some members of the Bitcoin community see the emergence of Bitcoin-based NFTs as a positive development. In contrast, they believe Bitcoin NFTs can bring more attention, use cases, and drive further development on the Bitcoin blockchain. The popularity of the Ordinal Protocol and the high prices of Ordinal Punk NFTs have sparked a debate within the Bitcoin community about the value of Bitcoin NFTs and their potential for the future of the blockchain.\n\nThe future of Ordinal Punks\n\nIt is difficult to predict the exact future of the NFT collection. This is because it is dependent on various factors, including the overall demand for NFTs and the adoption of the Ordinal Protocol. However, some enthusiasts believe that Ordinal Punks could become highly valuable digital assets. This is due to their scarcity and unique identity on the Bitcoin blockchain. Additionally, as more people become interested in NFTs and the underlying blockchain technology, it is possible that the demand for Ordinal Punks will increase. Overall, the future of the project will likely be shaped by the ongoing evolution of the NFT space and the broader adoption of blockchain technology."

        "content": "Bitcoin price is trading at resistance currently, and it could be the last stop before massive price mark up, according to a Wyckoff accumulation schematic\n\nTake a look at the shocking comparison to the schematic below and learn more about the mechanics behind \u201cWyckoff logic.\u201d Plus, find out what might happen next if the schematic is accurate.\n\nBitcoin Price Action Mimics 9 Months Of Wyckoff Accumulation\n\nThe top cryptocurrency by market cap went from being pronounced dead following the FTX collapse, to suddenly showing signs of coming back to life.\n\nBitcoin price is up more than 60% from 2022 lows and around 50% year-to-date. It has outperformed the stock market, gold, and just about every other asset class in 2023.\n\nThe price increase might only be the beginning according to a Wyckoff accumulation schematic, which closely mimics the price action in Bitcoin since June of last year.\n\nA nearly 50% plunge per coin in June 2022 brought BTC to a potential \u201cselling climax.\u201d The support level held for some time, but ultimately was swept in what is referred to in Wyckoff theory as a \u201cspring.\u201d\n\nAfter the spring, the asset being accumulated should rise to resistance, and BTCUSD is doing just that. What happens next will confirm or invalidate the conditions of the schematic.\n\nIs Bitcoin about to jump the creek? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nWhat Happens After Crypto \u201cJumps The Creek?\u201d\n\nIf Bitcoin price continues to follow the schematic, what comes next? According to Wyckoff theory, there are four phases in a market cycle: accumulation, mark up, distribution, and mark down.\n\nMark up comes after an extended accumulation phase, which could lead to BTCUSD increasing dramatically over a short period of time. But it has to \u201cjump the creek\u201d first after pushing through the current resistance level.\n\nWyckoff logic focuses on what \u201cthe Composite man\u201d is doing behind the scenes. The Composite man is a representation of smart money and whales who control the underlying dynamics driving market uptrends and downtrends.\n\nThe Composite man is especially deft at cloaking their movements and taking advantage of extremes in supply or demand. For example, smart money carefully accumulates assets at the lowest prices and distributes them on the market at the highest profits.\n\nBitcoin price will have spent nine full months in accumulation, if mark up follows. Considering the length of time that BTC has been in an accumulation phase, the mark up phase that follows could be massive. The last time BTCUSD spent this long in an accumulation range, was 2015. Bitcoin rallied from $160 per coin, to $20,000 when it was all said and done. The cryptocurrency became a household name.\n\nThis time around, Bitcoin\u2019s current low was $16,000. A similar move would take the top cryptocurrency by market cap to nearly $200,000 per BTC. Such results aren\u2019t likely again due to the law of diminishing returns, but a sizable move is possible nonetheless.\n\nAccording to this Wyckoff schematic, #Bitcoin is about ready to \"jump the creek\" after nearly nine months of accumulation. $BTCUSD pic.twitter.com/sR0mSWoums \u2014 Tony \"The Bull\" (@tonythebullBTC) March 16, 2023\n\nFollow @TonyTheBullBTC on Twitter or join the TonyTradesBTC Telegram for exclusive daily market insights and technical analysis education.

        "content": "Another basic economic principle that whales can take advantage of says the price of an asset will increase if the demand exceeds supply. With this in mind, an individual or group of bitcoin whales can initiate buying pressure. If the coin supply does not meet this high demand, the price of BTC will surge. This buying spree may trigger the fear of missing out ( FOMO ) among other traders. As a result, traders will likely start to buy BTC in the hopes that the price will continue to rise. Once BTC surges to the desired price, the whale can start selling at a profit."

        "title": "Bitcoin [BTC] bounces back: All you need to know as king coin crosses $26k - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "BTC traded momentarily above $26,000 on 14 March.\n\nOn-chain data indicated positive sentiment.\n\nDuring the intraday trading session on 14 March, Bitcoin [BTC] momentarily traded at a staggering high of $26,500 for the first time since August 2022. The rally in price was due to the positive sentiment that lingered in the market as many expect potential US interest rate cuts.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAfter trading below the $20,000 price mark last weekend following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVIB), BTC regained its momentum and rallied after Federal Regulators confirmed that they would make SVIB depositors whole.\n\nBTC has since clinched important milestones on-chain. Per data from on-chain data provider Santiment, during the trading session on 14 March, BTC whales made the highest count of transactions exceeding $1 million since November 2022.\n\nAn increase in whale transactions is a great indicator of bullish sentiments in the market. If momentum is sustained, further price growth is guaranteed.\n\n? #Bitcoin is continuing its amazing recovery, shooting all the way above $26.5k alongside #bullish #Fed news of potential US interest rate cuts. Whales are making the highest level of $BTC $1M+ transactions in 4 months after breaking 9-month price highs. https://t.co/me6fogpy6X pic.twitter.com/HIGnVAqYKz \u2014 Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 14, 2023\n\nFurther, the recent uptick in the king coin\u2019s price \u201chas sent +2.7M Coins into profitability,\u201d on-chain data provider Glassnode said in a tweet.\n\nAccording to Glassnode,\n\n\u201cThis indicates that ~20% of the Adjusted Circulating Supply was acquired within the $20k \u2013 $26k region.\u201d\n\nBTC\u2019s \u201cAdjusted Circulating Supply\u201d refers to the number of coins that are actively in circulation, minus any coins that have not moved for a long period (these are considered \u201clost\u201d coins).\n\nGlassnode\u2019s statement that around 20% of BTC\u2019s adjusted circulating supply was acquired within the price range of $20,000 to $26,000 meant that these holders were put back in profit when BTC traded above $26,000.\n\nThe recent surge in #Bitcoin price action (+22%) has sent +2.7M Coins into profitability. This indicates that ~20% of the Adjusted Circulating Supply was acquired within the $20k \u2013 $26k region. This workbench is available for Tier 2 membership and above: https://t.co/BgfZ9OsJPA pic.twitter.com/pxCg90n3M7 \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) March 14, 2023\n\nWhat else do we see on-chain?\n\nMarket sentiment has improved significantly since the week began. BTC\u2019s price traded as high as $24,574 on Monday and forced the liquidation of about $81 million BTC short positions. With many betting in favor of further price growth, data from Coinglass revealed that short traders remained the biggest losers in the BTC market.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nFurther, for the first time since SVIB\u2019s collapse, BTC funding rates have turned positive. When an asset\u2019s funding rates are positive, it indicates that the demand to go long (buy) is high. This can be seen as a bullish signal, suggesting that traders are willing to pay a premium to maintain their long positions.\n\nAt press time, BTC\u2019s weighted sentiment was a positive 5.958. If BTC sustains this level, prices could increase further."

        "title": "Bitcoin doesn't fix this - CoinGeek",
        "content": "As we watch the Federal Reserve, FDIC and other agencies reassure the world that \u201ceverything is fine,\u201d we also have to deal with the nauseating cacophony of small blockers pretending to be excited about global collapse because \u201cBitcoin fixes this.\u201d\n\nAs a Bitcoiner, I don\u2019t think it does, and here\u2019s why!\n\nWhat is fractional reserve banking?\n\nBanks keep only a fraction of the funds deposited by their customers on reserve, while lending out the rest to borrowers. In other words, banks are allowed to lend out a portion of the money that they receive from depositors, rather than holding onto all of it. This is great when faith in the institution is strong, but when the economy (or in some cases, the news) makes people feel uneasy, this can change rapidly.\n\nThe idea behind fractional reserve banking is that it allows banks to earn a profit by charging interest on loans, while also providing a convenient service to customers by allowing them to easily access their funds with friendly tellers and a mix of payment tools. However, it also creates a potential problem known as a \u201crun on the bank,\u201d where depositors all try to withdraw their funds at the same time, leaving the bank unable to fulfill all of the withdrawal requests.\n\nTo prevent this from happening, governments typically require banks to hold a certain percentage of their deposits in reserve, and there are vehicles like the FDIC that guarantee deposits with a federally backed insurance system.\n\nGreat! R-r-r-right?\n\nWell, not always.\n\nWhy do bank runs happen?\n\nA bank run is like a game of musical chairs, but with money. As soon as the music stops, everyone rushes to grab a chair (or their money), leaving a few unlucky folks standing without a seat (or their savings). It\u2019s like the world\u2019s least-fun game show, where the prize is just getting your own money back.\n\nThe problem is the spillover effects of such behavior can lead to what the media called \u201ccontagion\u201d where increasingly larger banks have runs as people get more and more spooked\u2014potentially leading to a full-blown financial crisis.\n\nWhen banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse fail, there is a sudden and significant loss of confidence in the financial system, and in this case, it might lead to a widespread panic and a rush to sell off larger and more systemic assets, including stocks, bonds, and real estate. Coupled with the rapid increase in interest rates, rising cost of living and other macroeconomic concerns, the world economy is looking like an increasingly shaky prospect.\n\nSo, Bitcoin fixes this?\n\nThe phrase \u201cBitcoin fixes this\u201d is often used by proponents of Bitcoin (most typically BTC) to suggest that the use of Bitcoin can help address certain issues in the current financial system, such as inflation, government corruption, or centralized control of money. But this is mostly nonsense.\n\nThis ignores what banks and Bitcoin actually do! Lending is an important economic function, and it is entered into with known risks. If lending occurred in an \u201call Bitcoin\u201d economy, the same risks would still exist because loans inherently have risk.\n\nFor small blockers, they seem to mean that holding Bitcoin should accrue value forever, and therefore someone who has Bitcoin would have no need for a loan ever again. But if their coins aren\u2019t meant to be spent, how can someone ever buy anything? Or maybe they just mean everyone can audit everything forever. Who knows?\n\nBitcoin doesn\u2019t fix this\n\nIn reality, Bitcoin was designed to solve problems of payment friction and data integrity.\n\nThere might be some tangential use cases where the use of Bitcoin can help the audit trail or public attestation of reserves, but the world can\u2019t function with low velocity money and everyone banking with a full reserve institution.\n\nWe need some debt, we need risk, we need credit systems and we need highly liquid digital cash that can be used by billions of people on earth. Right now, no blockchain is capable of that scale as currently implemented, and most don\u2019t even think it is worth it to try.\n\nAn attitude of separatism and seclusion will work for some people in a crisis, but by design, it can\u2019t work for too many people at once. And if the world truly falls into chaos, it might be wiser to have guns, ammo, water filtration and precious metals for the doomsday portfolio.\n\nAnd while everyone\u2019s hoarding apocalypse assets while praying for collapse, I still think it is both wise and moral to focus on reducing global payment friction and building a base layer that can manage tokens, contracts, titles and other data in a way that stops the economy from collapsing at all.\n\nWouldn\u2019t that be better?\n\nThat\u2019s something Bitcoin could fix, if we could just work together.\n\nWatch Kurt Wuckert Jr. on CoinGeek Conversations: Bitcoin needs more salespeople\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain? Check out CoinGeek\u2019s Blockchain for Beginners section, the ultimate resource guide to learn more about blockchain technology."

But we also want payment variety, meaning online casinos that support altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin Cash, or Dogecoin.\n\nPayout times should be measured in minutes if possible, and the fees should be as close to 0. If fiat currency is supported in addition to crypto payments, that\u2019s great as well\n\nMobile Optimization and Customer Support:\n\nThe best online casinos will be fully optimized for mobile play, meaning you can access all your favorite slots and casino games from all mobile devices, including your smartphone or tablet.\n\nAnd finally, we want to see excellent customer support so you can get help when you need it.

We always say you should play Bitcoin slot machines in free mode before putting real money on the line.\n\nThis way, you can get a feel for the game and decide if it\u2019s something you want to spend your money on. Most of the time, you\u2019ll find that the free versions are just as good as the real money games, if not better!\n\nDo Bitcoin Slot Machines Have a Higher RTP Than Traditional Online Slots Games?\n\nThe short answer is no. The RTP (return to player) of a Bitcoin slot machine is usually the same as a regular slot machine.\n\nThe RTP is a mathematical formula used by casinos to determine how much they can expect to earn from a slot game over time. It\u2019s important to remember that the RTP is a long-term average, so you might experience some variation in your results.\n\nCan I Win Bitcoin Playing Slots?\n\nYes, you can! People have won (and continue to win) large sums of Bitcoin by playing slot games.\n\nOf course, luck plays a big role in winning any kind of casino game, but there are some things you can do to increase your chances of success.\n\nFor one, make sure you\u2019re playing at a reputable casino with a good selection of high-quality games.\n\nAnother thing you can do is take advantage of casino bonuses and promotions. Many casinos offer deposit bonuses, which give you extra money to play with when you make a deposit.\n\nYou can also look for special promotions that allow you to win big prizes or even jackpots. These are usually offered by progressive slots, with a growing jackpot that gets bigger the more people play.\n\nSo keep your eyes peeled for these opportunities, and you could be the next big winner!\n\nWhat Are the Best Bitcoin Slots To Play?\n\nThere are so many great Bitcoin slots out there that it\u2019s hard to choose just a few. However, some of our favorites include\n\nMaster of Starz at Bitstarz\n\n777 Deluxe at Ignition\n\nRags to Witches at Super Slots\n\nThese are just a few of the many great Bitcoin slots available today. So take your pick and start playing!\n\nWhat Are the Best Crypto Slots Sites?\n\nAfter a lengthy review process, we can say that the following 5 platforms are the best crypto slots sites right now:\n\nBitstarz is the best crypto slots site overall because it offers the most impressive catalog of slot games combined with up to 5 BTC in welcome bonus money and 180 free spins.\n\nBC Game excels in terms of variety of Bitcoin slots; Ignition is where it\u2019s at for higher-RTP online slots, while Red Dog hosts a fantastic selection of RTG crypto slots.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a bonus hunter, Super Slots is one of the best crypto slot sites.\n\nAre Bitcoin Slots Than Traditional Slots?\n\nYes, we think so! Bitcoin casinos offer more anonymity than regular casino sites. This is because you don\u2019t need to provide personal information when signing up for an account at the casino. All you need is a valid email address.\n\nAdditionally, crypto casinos usually have lower fees than traditional casinos online.

        "title": "Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin briefly tops $26,000; Avalanche, Solana, Dogecoin jump up to 6% - Business Today",
        "content": "Buoyant sentiments continued to prevail in the crypto market as Bitcoin and other tokens extended their gains for the straight third day. However, the gains were capped and some tokens saw some profit booking during the early trading hours in Asia.\n\nTraders expect that the worst is over for the digital token market after the global fallout triggered by the American banking sector. Coupled with this, the US inflation numbers were in-line with the expectation, hinting that aggressive rate hikes by the US Fed are likely to be scrapped.\n\nBitcoin briefly topped the $26,000 market before giving up some gains. The largest crypto token was last seen below $25,000 level. Its largest peer Ethereum also attempted to top $1,800 but was barely holding the $1,700 mark at the time of writing this report. Altcoins outperformed the blue-chip tokens a few rose up to 35 per cent.\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest crypto asset surged by over 12 per cent in the last one week. The UK government bailing out the Silicon Valley Bank has created a positive sentiment within the investment community and which may have increased buying activity, said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin.\n\n\n\n\"As per the latest data, US consumer inflation has slowed down but it's still on the higher side which may drive the Fed to continue its hawkish stance. If the macroeconomic factors continue to remain favorable then we may see Bitcoin testing $30,000 level very soon,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBarring the US dollar-pegged stablecoins and Tron, all other popular crypto tokens extended their gains on Wednesday. Avalanche surged about 6 per cent, whereas Litecoin gained 5 per cent. Dogecoin, Solana and Polkadot were up 4 per cent, each.\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading higher at $1.10 trillion, after rising more than 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged more than 13 per cent close to $102.40 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin reached its highest point in nine months by surging above the $26,000 level. This was due to some encouraging inflation data and the banking sector's continued recovery from a near-catastrophic situation, said Edul Patel, CEO and Co-Founder of Mudrex.\n\n\n\n\"Although Bitcoin later gave up some of its gains, it remains up by 81 per cent from its lowest cycle. Ethereum has also been experiencing an upward trend, surpassing a crucial resistance level of $1,700. The current positive developments in the market indicate an overall bullish sentiment,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View By Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nOn the back of US CPI numbers pinning inflation at expected 6 per cent, Bitcoin (BTC) broke through the $26,000 level and was up by about a strong 30 per cent in the last 2 days. This is BTC\u2019s highest since June 2022. The fact that BTC has only one strong near-term resistance in its golden pocket at $25,959 should further give merit to its bullishness\n\nBut it has shed its gains and is trading below $25,000 again. Thus, despite a continuation of a bullish market structure with higher highs and higher lows, its bullish scenario of targeting the next resistance at $28,790 should be on pause for now.\n\nBTC\u2019s 50-day and 200-day moving averages (at $22,944 and $19,716, respectively,) coupled with its RSI of around 80 indicate that it might be overbought. BTC might end up falling down to its next support at $23,965 before its next attempt at a higher move.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels\n\nResistance: $25,960, $26,670, $28,800\n\nSupport: $23,965, $21,970, $19,500\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "The Bitcoin (BTC) Whale, Who Sold At $69K, Has Started Accumulating RenQ Finance (RENQ); The Reason Will ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is full of surprises, and it\u2019s not uncommon for investors to make bold moves. Recently, news broke out that a Bitcoin (BTC) whale who sold at $69K has started to accumulate RenQ Finance (RENQ). This move has left many investors wondering what could have motivated the whale to make such a shift.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look at RenQ Finance (RENQ) and explore why the whale might have chosen to invest in this project. We\u2019ll also examine some of the unique features of RenQ Finance (RENQ) and explain why it could be a smart investment choice for 2023.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Whales Restrategize with a focus on New Coins\n\nBitcoin (BTC) whales, or large cryptocurrency holders, are now strategizing with a focus on new coins. RenQ Finance (RENQ) is one of these coins. These whales, known for their ability to manipulate the cryptocurrency market with their massive holdings, have been identified by tracking their activities through known whale addresses, order books, sudden changes in market capitalization, and trades on crypto exchanges.\n\nIn the past, Bitcoin (BTC) whales have caused volatility in the market by putting up massive sell orders for their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, keeping the price lower than other sell orders. However, now they seem to be shifting their focus towards new types of coins.\n\nOne reason for this shift in strategy could be the growing interest of traditional firms in cryptocurrency. Companies like MicroStrategy have acquired large amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) and issued company debt to buy more. As these traditional firms enter the market, Bitcoin (BTC) whales may see opportunities in newer, lesser-known coins that can potentially offer higher returns.\n\nThe focus on new coins by Bitcoin (BTC) whales indicates a changing landscape in the cryptocurrency market, where traditional firms are becoming more involved, and investments in lesser-known coins are becoming more attractive.\n\n>>>>> BUY RENQ TOKENS HERE <<<<<\n\nWhy whales are choosing to Invest heavily in RenQ Finance (RENQ)\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) is a multi-chain non-custodial decentralized exchange that elevates decentralized trading by offering users a direct trading option via the RenQ wallet app. RenQ Finance (RENQ) aims to connect all isolated blockchains and establish a cross-chain asset exchange network, all while providing the DeFi ecosystem with all necessary underlying support. This will provide every digital asset owner with a truly safe, free, and transparent DeFi service.\n\nWhales are choosing to invest heavily in RenQ Finance (RENQ) for a few reasons. The RenQ wallet app is one of the main benefits of RenQ Finance (RENQ). The RenQ wallet app provides users with all of the benefits of centralized exchanges in a decentralized setting. It combines all DEXs into a single dApp, giving users access to a diverse range of liquidity sources. Users can engage in various DeFi activities such as Swapping, Staking, Lending, and Borrowing, among others, as well as a whole new set of features available only through large centralized exchanges. The best part is that you can do all of this without having to create a new account on each trading platform you visit.\n\nAnother reason whales invest heavily in RenQ Finance (RENQ) is its governance mechanism allowing users to vote on proposals and decisions affecting the platform\u2019s development. This means that users can participate in the platform\u2019s development by staking their RenQ Finance (RENQ) tokens, the platform\u2019s native token. This helps create a sense of community and ensures that users have a say in the platform\u2019s future direction.\n\nRenQ Finance\u2019s (RENQ) mission to make DeFi accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of expertise, makes it an attractive investment for whales. The RenQ Finance (RENQ) platform provides users with a seamless experience that combines the benefits of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. This means that users can enjoy the security and trust of a centralized exchange while also taking advantage of the decentralization benefits of a decentralized exchange.\n\nLooking to the future, RenQ Finance (RENQ) is expected to be a major player in the DeFi space. The coin is currently in its presale stages, with seven more stages before launching at $0.055. The RenQ Finance (RENQ) price is expected to soar to $1.5 by the end of 2023, a 75x return on investment for early investors. Market analysts predict gains to increase by over 1000x during the 2024 market rally. RenQ Finance (RENQ) presale prices are a bargain, so invest now for profitable returns in 2023.

        "content": "Authorities have seized and taken down the website of ChipMixer\n\nThe crypto mixer was used to launder funds stolen from Binance, Ronin Bridge, and FTX\n\nBitcoin mixer \u2013 ChipMixer has been shut down by authorities, as per an announcement by Europol. The operation involved the collaboration of regulatory authorities from various countries. The operation also resulted in the seizure of four servers, over 1909.4 Bitcoins (BTC) \u2013 over $46.6 million (nearly EUR 44.2 million), and 7 TB of data.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nMultiple agencies collaborate to bring down the Bitcoin mixer\n\nUnited States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Homeland Security Investigation, and Department of Justice took part in taking down the platform. Germany\u2019s Federal Criminal Police Office and General Prosecutors Office Frankfurt-Main also headed the operations. Others included Belgium\u2019s Federal police, Poland\u2019s Central Cybercrime Bureau, and Switzerland\u2019s Cantonal Police of Zurich. The press release further said,\n\n\u201cThe ChipMixer software blocked the blockchain trail of the funds, making it attractive for cybercriminals looking to launder illegal proceeds from criminal activities such as drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, ransomware attacks, and payment card fraud.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Europol claims that the Bitcoin mixer, launched in mid-2017, was used to launder over $2.87 billion in cryptocurrencies. A majority of this activity was related to markets in the darkweb, stolen cryptocurrencies, and illegal goods trafficking.\n\nNotably, ransomware groups like Mamba, Dharma, Zeppelin, and others have the Bitcoin mixer to launder illegally obtained funds. In addition, the regulatory authorities are investigating the platform\u2019s possible association with the funds related to the now-bankrupt crypto exchange \u2013 FTX. The authorities are investigating whether the mixer was used by hackers to launder FTX\u2019s funds, which totally amounted to $372 million. As per an on-chain sleuth, ZachXBT, ChipMixer was used to launder 360 BTC of FTX\u2019s funds.\n\nThe Bitcoin mixer was also used by hackers to launder money stolen by Ronin Bridge, according to a report by Slowmist. Hackers had sent 26,021.89 BTC to Chipmixer. The same platform was used by Binance hackers in August 2019, with over 5,300 BTC sent for mixing.\n\nThe current action has resulted in the shut down of the website. However, the authority has not announced any arrests related to the case. The press release further read,"

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have been on a roller coaster ride in recent years, with extreme volatility and unpredictable price swings.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin (BTC) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) are two cryptocurrencies that have shown resilience in the market and are poised to drive the next bull run.\n\nIn this article, we will explore three reasons why these two cryptocurrencies have the potential to be major players in the upcoming cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) \u2013 The King of Cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization that far exceeds any other cryptocurrency. Its history of resilience, withstanding multiple market crashes, has earned it the nickname \u201cdigital gold.\u201d Additionally, the current macroeconomic environment, with unprecedented levels of money printing and inflation, has made Bitcoin an attractive hedge against inflation.\n\nMoreover, institutional adoption of Bitcoin has been on the rise. Companies such as Tesla, Square, and MicroStrategy have invested billions of dollars in Bitcoin, adding credibility and mainstream appeal to the cryptocurrency. The entry of large institutional investors and banks into the Bitcoin market has brought a new level of legitimacy and stability to the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event, which will reduce the block reward for miners by half, will further reduce the supply of Bitcoin, potentially leading to an increase in demand and a price rise.\n\nAfter the anticipated last bitcoin halving in 2040, block rewards will no longer be in the form of bitcoin. Instead, miners will receive fees from users of the network who buy and sell bitcoin, providing them with incentives to continue processing transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) \u2013 An AI-Driven Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Platform\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) is a relatively new cryptocurrency that has been gaining popularity due to its unique features and strong community support. RENQ is an AI-driven decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aims to provide users with a high level of security, transparency, and speed. The platform allows users to earn interest on their investments and provides them with access to a range of financial products and services.\n\nOne of the key features of RenQ Finance is its low transaction fees and fast transaction times, making it an attractive option for those looking to participate in DeFi. RENQ holders have voting rights and can shape the direction of the platform, adding a layer of community governance to the platform.\n\nRenQ Finance has also been making significant strides in expanding its ecosystem, with several partnerships and collaborations. Moreover, RenQ Finance\u2019s partnership with CertiK, a leading blockchain security company, has provided investors with an added layer of security, making it a trustworthy investment option.\n\n>>>>> BUY RENQ TOKENS HERE <<<<<\n\n3 Reasons why Bitcoin (BTC) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) will drive the next bull run\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) are two cryptocurrencies that have gained a lot of attention in recent years. Both have unique features that make them stand out in the crowded cryptocurrency market. Here are three reasons why these two cryptocurrencies are expected to drive the next bull run:\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Halving Event\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. This scarcity is maintained through a process called mining, which involves solving complex mathematical equations to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. However, the number of new coins that can be mined per block is halved approximately every four years. This event is known as the Bitcoin halving, and it is designed to slow down the rate at which new coins are created and help maintain the scarcity of Bitcoin. The previous two halving events in 2012 and 2016 were followed by significant price increases, and experts expect the next halving in 2024 to have a similar effect on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nInstitutional Adoption\n\nOne of the main drivers of the current bull run is the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors. Large companies like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square have all invested significant amounts of their treasuries into Bitcoin, citing it as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. This trend is expected to continue as more companies recognize the benefits of owning cryptocurrencies and seek to diversify their portfolios.\n\nRenQ Finance also has the potential for institutional adoption due to its focus on governance and community engagement. The platform\u2019s strong emphasis on transparency and accountability makes it an attractive investment option for institutional investors looking for secure and reliable investment opportunities.\n\nGrowing Demand\n\nThe demand for cryptocurrencies is steadily increasing, driven by factors like increasing inflation, geopolitical instability, and the growing popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. As more people recognize the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies, the demand for them is likely to increase, driving up their prices.\n\nRenQ Finance is uniquely positioned to benefit from this growing demand due to its user-friendly interface and simple investment process. The platform\u2019s focus on community engagement and governance also makes it an attractive option for investors looking for a cryptocurrency that prioritizes transparency and accountability.\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin and RenQ Finance are two cryptocurrencies that are expected to drive the next bull run. The Bitcoin halving event, institutional adoption, and growing demand are all factors that are likely to contribute to their success in the coming years.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nPresale: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Are We in a Bitcoin Supercycle? - Money.ca",
        "content": "In this article\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the price surge in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and is it sustainable? Many believe we\u2019re actually in the middle of a Bitcoin supercycle. This is an exciting time to be an investor in cryptocurrency, but you should have an understanding of what\u2019s going on before you jump in.\n\nBitcoin has entered a new stage of mainstream acceptance. Now more than ever, it\u2019s seen as a legitimate investment that can deliver real value. Bitcoin is gradually becoming less of a speculative investment and more of a form of asset storage. Just as you diversify your portfolio across different financial securities and different currencies, you should consider diversifying into cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin is only growing in accessibility, acceptance, and utility. More e-commerce stores are adding cryptocurrency as an acceptable form of payment, and there are constantly more ways to spend your Bitcoin, such as with cards that work at brick-and-mortar stores. Recently the first Bitcoin ETF was approved in Canada, making Bitcoin accessible to investors on the traditional stock exchange.\n\nWhat is a supercycle?\n\nA supercycle is a phenomenon where the bullish increase in the price of a market security causes its price to increase further.\n\nThink of it as a positive feedback loop: people become interested in an investment so they start buying it, which drives up the price, and that makes more people confident about it and encourages them to buy more so the price goes up further, and so on.\n\nTypically, the term \u2018supercycle\u2019 is used to refer to a decades-long bullish run of commodities, but lately many financial analysts have been applying the term to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been incredibly popular over the past decade, but especially so since the COVID19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin has entered a new stage of mainstream acceptance. Now more than ever, it\u2019s seen as a legitimate investment that can deliver real value. Bitcoin is gradually becoming less of a speculative investment and more of a form of asset storage. Just as you diversify your portfolio across different financial securities and different currencies, you should consider diversifying into cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin is only growing in accessibility, acceptance, and utility. More e-commerce stores are adding cryptocurrency as an acceptable form of payment, and there are constantly more ways to spend your Bitcoin, such as with cards that work at brick-and-mortar stores. Recently the first Bitcoin ETF was approved in Canada, making Bitcoin accessible to investors on the traditional stock exchange.\n\nThe ever-increasing interest and investment in Bitcoin is driving its price higher. Furthermore, because it seems that more and more investors will be jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon, we can expect its price to continue to go up. This exactly why many are saying we\u2019re in the middle of a Bitcoin supercycle!\n\nHow COVID legitimized Bitcoin\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has hit everyone hard, but Bitcoin seems to be the exception. A global crisis that tanked the traditional stock market and brought the global economy to a standstill only served to showcase exactly how powerful cryptocurrency is. Where do you put your money when the world economy is in turmoil? The answer is in an asset that\u2019s free from cumbersome political and geographical hang-ups.\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency, in general, is one of the most useful ways to diversify your investments and store cash, because it\u2019s not tied to one country or currency. Bitcoin is the ultimate global asset and is being heralded as the \u201cGold 2.0\u201d on which the rest of our monetary system is based.\n\nBitcoin price predictions\n\nBitcoin traded under $1 per coin from 2009 to 2011. In 2013, it peaked at $1,242 only to crash back down to between $300 to $600 for the majority of the following 4 years. In 2017, we saw the first big run-up of Bitcoin, peaking at over $18,000 in December of that year. It experienced another pullback before getting pushed to a new high in 2020 and it\u2019s continued its climb ever since. Bitcoin is now valued at over $58,000 USD and still headed higher.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins have been bullish on crypto since the beginning and insist it\u2019s going to $500,000. More modest estimates peg it at $200,000 to $250,000 for 2021, and others still insist it will eventually hit $1 million. Only time will tell who is right, but the general consensus is that Bitcoin is going to continue to go up for the foreseeable future.\n\nAre we currently in a Bitcoin supercycle?\n\nIt\u2019s been around since 2009, but Bitcoin is still a very new financial security with a relatively short price history. Because of this, it\u2019s difficult to reliably assess patterns in Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that we are in the middle of a Bitcoin supercycle.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market cycle appears to be about 4 years long, consisting of a run-up followed by a dramatic pull-back. This market cycle is centred around Bitcoin halving events which happen approximately every 4 years. A \u201chalving event\u201d is when the reward of mining new Bitcoin blocks drops by 50%. This will continue until all 21 million Bitcoins are mined. We just completed one of these halving events in 2020, which means we are again at the beginning of another 4-year Bitcoin market cycle.\n\nThe Bitcoin market cycle consists of four distinct phases: accumulation, continuation, parabolic, and correction. Here\u2019s a breakdown of each:\n\nAccumulation phase\n\nAs you may guess from the name, this is when investors accumulate Bitcoin. This phase happened at Bitcoin\u2019s launch, and also occurs following the phase of the Bitcoin market cycle, the correction phase. The accumulation phase is the best time to buy Bitcoin in order to maximize overall returns.\n\nContinuation phase\n\nAs investors accumulate Bitcoin, the price gets pushed higher until it enters its continuation phase. The Bitcoin halving events occur in the continuation phase, spurring a new wave of accumulation that kicks off the parabolic phase.\n\nParabolic phase\n\nThe parabolic phase is marked by Bitcoin hitting all-new highs in price. Many investors will capture profits, selling partial or all of their holdings, which can result in significant price corrections. This phase is marked by extreme volatility!\n\nCorrection phase\n\nAfter all the excitement of the parabolic phase, Bitcoin is due for a correction. Historically Bitcoin has seen an average 80% price drop during the correction phase, so when this hits, expect it to hurt.\n\nWhere are we now?\n\nWe are now in the parabolic phase of the Bitcoin market cycle which is always defined by extreme volatility and investor euphoria. It\u2019s an exciting and profitable time to invest! The parabolic phase will be followed by a correction phase, in which we will see a dramatic pullback in Bitcoin\u2019s price. However, there\u2019s no way of knowing yet what all-time high Bitcoin will hit before the pullback phase begins.\n\nGiven the growing interest in Bitcoin by institutional and retail investors alike, as well as the increase in the availability of products and platforms to invest in Bitcoin, all signs point to the price continuing to go up. No matter what, 2021 will be a very exciting time to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nHow to invest during a Bitcoin supercycle\n\nWhen it comes to investing in a supercycle, the sooner you get in, the better. The very nature of a supercycle is continuous bullish price movement, which means you\u2019re likely to see your investment continue to go up.\n\nIf you\u2019re not already investing in Bitcoin, now is the time to start. You can begin with as little cash as you can spare, and use a trading app to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies right on your mobile device. You have no excuse to stay on the sidelines anymore!\n\nWealthsimple Crypto also offers one of the best and easiest to use platforms for buying cryptocurrency. There\u2019s no minimum balance required to open an account, and you can invest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. If you\u2019re already a Wealthsimple Trade user, you\u2019ll find it super simple to toggle between the traditional stock market and the cryptocurrency exchange platform.\n\nWhen it comes to investing in Bitcoin during a supercycle, the same strategy that works for all your investments is applicable here: invest small amounts that you can afford on a consistent basis. Putting $100 into Bitcoin every week or two is more than enough to enjoy the rewards of investing in cryptocurrency without breaking the bank.\n\nIs the end of a supercycle a super crash?\n\nYou might be thinking the only possible end to a Bitcoin supercycle is a dramatic pullback, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly less likely we will see the same dramatic dips characteristic of Bitcoin in the past. While it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see many dramatic dips of 20% (or more) in Bitcoin\u2019s price, its general trend will continue upward for 2021.\n\nIn the coming months and years, expect to see Bitcoin increasingly accepted at your favourite stores, and more readily available as an investment product at your bank or brokerage. You may be paying for your morning takeout coffee with Bitcoin by the end of the year!\n\nWe will be due for a price correction at the end of the parabolic phase of the Bitcoin market cycle, but that seems to be a ways away yet. And when it does happen, it\u2019s really just a time to buy more.\n\nWhat does this mean for the Canadian investor?\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency are here to stay, and if you don\u2019t add some to your portfolio you run the risk of being left behind. But don\u2019t forget to balance your hopes and dreams with your tolerance for risk! Now is not the time to move all of your money out of traditional investments like stocks and bonds and into cryptocurrency. But it is a great time to start investing in Bitcoin and enjoy a great upside over the long term.\n\nRecommended reads:"

I discovered there was a huge community of people out there who want to spend their Bitcoin on physical goods, so I thought why not!\n\n'People are making hundreds, if not thousands a day, investing in Bitcoin or trading Bitcoin, so I thought why not give them a place to spend it?\n\n'The fact no one else is doing it is a perfect opportunity for me to get in before the rush and be the first.\n\n'I hope it brings in a lot of customers who wouldn\u2019t have chosen us unless we offered this service.\n\n'My hope has always been to create a place where people will come into the city centre from all over the world to try our pizza.'\n\nThe Gloucester Rugby fan created a hub for rugby and food when he took over the pizza restaurant, which was formerly known as Hooker & Eight.\n\nNow called Dough From Dough, the restaurant serves pizzas with memorable names including the Cherry and White Margherita; the Sin Bin created by rugby player, Lewis Ludlow; the Green Green Grass of 'Holm; as well as the provocative Cheltenham Average - a jokey tribute to the veg supreme supermarket classic.\n\nSeating up to 40 diners in its pizzeria, it also does takeaways which diners can pay for in Bitcoin too.\n\nIt's open from Wednesday to Saturday for dinner, with lunch served from Thursday to Saturday, too."

        "content": "Introduction Cryptocurrency has undeniably gained popularity in recent years. With no indication of slowing down, Bitcoin, the first and most well-known digital money, is leading\u2026\n\nIntroduction\n\nCryptocurrency has undeniably gained popularity in recent years. With no indication of slowing down, Bitcoin, the first and most well-known digital money, is leading this new financial revolution. To invest in bitcoins, you can visit online trading platforms like thequantumai.app\n\nHowever, what exactly is it about Bitcoin that has others so curious? What makes it unique?\n\nThis essay will look more closely at the justifications for blockchain as the future\u2019s money. We\u2019ll examine the top five reasons people think Bitcoin will skyrocket in popularity and value over the following years.\n\nReasons Why Bitcoin Is a Good Alternative to Fiat Money\n\nOne of the strongest justifications for understanding Bitcoin\u2019s potential and how it may develop into the money of the future is that it offers a competitive alternative to fiat money. Governments issue fiat money, which may be accepted as legal cash and has a fixed value.\n\nBitcoin is a substitute for fiat money because\n\nIt is decentralized since no one entity is in charge of determining its worth or how widely it is used.\n\nWith just 21 million BTC ever generated and no other BTC currencies issued after that, it has built-in scarcity.\n\nIt establishes confidence between two parties by having an accessible public ledger that anybody can use to audit transactions.\n\nBecause of its cryptographic nature, transactions are safe, quick, and affordable.\n\nBecause of its immutability, transactions that have already been performed cannot be changed or reversed.\n\nOne of bitcoin\u2019s most intriguing qualities is its ability to function as a different currency. We could develop a payment system that is safer and more effective by creating a system that does not depend on a central authority or middleman for its legitimacy.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s advantages in terms of security and transparency\n\nBitcoin is the most secure currency out there. It is mainly impervious to censorship and theft since no reserve bank or a single controller can control the system. Every Bitcoin transaction is cryptographically protected inside the blockchain, a decentralized database almost hard to hack or alter.\n\nAlso, the blockchain makes all Bitcoin transactions visible to the public and verifiable. As a result, every transaction can be checked for accuracy and traced as it travels across the network. Traditional national banks cannot provide the amount of visibility into financial operations at any moment that this level of openness affords financial entities, such as banks and governments.\n\nTo sum up, Bitcoin has the following benefits over conventional fiat currencies in terms of security and transparency:\n\nThe network is entirely decentralized using Bitcoin, with no one entity in charge.\n\nIt is resistant to hacking attempts thanks to cryptography.\n\nProspects for Growth and Competition of Bitcoin\n\nOne of its most fascinating features is the potential for the expansion and disruption of Bitcoin. Technology is transforming banking, government, finance, and our way of life. The top five reasons why Cryptocurrency will eventually replace fiat money are listed below.\n\nSimple and Safe Transactions\n\nUnlike conventional currencies, which depend on intermediaries like banks or financial organizations to monitor transactions, Bitcoin enables risk-free direct money transfers between users. It\u2019s safe, quick, and inexpensive in fees or paperwork.\n\nLow costs\n\nSince no intermediaries are involved, bitcoin transactions are inexpensive compared to conventional money transfer networks like credit cards. The result might be significant cost reductions for both consumers and businesses.\n\nSecurity of Identity\n\nBitcoin provides an unmatched degree of identity security compared to conventional payment methods since it runs on a distributed platform where all operations are secured and protected. It means you won\u2019t need to be concerned about disclosing your account details or personal information each time you make an online transaction.\n\nPossibility of Growth\n\nBitcoin\u2019s potential for disruption increases dramatically as more businesses adopt it, and it continues to gain popularity. It may result in a whole new financial structure that puts more power back in the hands of the people rather than being governed by major institutions or governments.\n\nTransparency\n\nHow individuals spend their money and who sends them users may find money simply by looking at the public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions. It enables us to monitor information previously unattainable with other conventional currencies, giving us a greater insight into how money moves across our ecosystem on a macro level.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Bit is a powerful decentralized asset with the potential to become the world\u2019s next primary reserve currency. With its tight supply restrictions, rising demand, secure network, and affordable fees, Cryptocurrency has much room for growth. With its enormous popularity and acceptance, Bitcoin will probably remain a well-liked digital asset.\n\nThe ideal method for anybody interested in Bitcoin to become engaged is to learn about the asset, comprehend the concept and its possibilities, and then purchase some BTC. It will provide the person access to electronic support and allow them to use its fantastic potential."

        "content": "OpenAI\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) platform ChatGPT has proven its usefulness in providing information on a wide range of topics, including the cryptocurrency sector, and its newest iteration was able to list all the reasons why the existence of Bitcoin (BTC) was necessary.\n\nIndeed, Michael Saylor, who is the founder and chairman of the enterprise analytics platform MicroStrategy, has asked GPT-4 why the world needed Bitcoin, and the AI platform has provided him with a detailed response containing eight specific reasons, as quoted by Saylor in a tweet published on March 15.\n\nFrom decentralization and accessibility to security\n\nAs the primary argument for the flagship digital asset, ChatGPT placed decentralization \u2013 the fact that no single entity, like government or financial institution, can control it, in turn providing more freedom, autonomy, and resistance to censorship and manipulation.\n\nSecondly, the AI tool singled out Bitcoin\u2019s ability to provide access to financial services to unbanked and underbanked individuals, such as in regions with limited or unavailable traditional banking systems, who only need a smartphone and internet access to use the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the third place are the fees of Bitcoin transactions that can be lower \u201ccompared to traditional financial services, especially for cross-border transactions,\u201d as ChatGPT highlighted, stressing this can also reduce costs for both customers and businesses involved in international transfers.\n\nFurthermore, \u201cBitcoin transactions are recorded on a public, tamper-resistant ledger called the blockchain,\u201d so \u201ctransactions can be easily verified and traced, reducing the risk of fraud and corruption.\u201d\n\nDeflationary, private, and programmable\n\nAs the chatbot also correctly observed, Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million BTC, which makes it a deflationary currency, reducing the risk of inflation, which tends to \u201cerode the purchasing power of traditional currencies over time.\u201d\n\nThe sixth pro-Bitcoin argument listed by GPT-4 was the greater degree of privacy when transferring assets compared to traditional transactions, thanks to the crypto transfers only being linked to a public address instead of sensitive personal information.\n\nIn the seventh place is Bitcoin\u2019s value as an investment and a method of diversification of financial portfolios, as the AI tool noted that the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) asset by market cap had demonstrated its \u201cpotential for significant growth in value over time.\u201d\n\nLast but not least, is the fact that:\n\n\u201cBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies enable programmable money through smart contracts, which can automate and streamline various financial processes and transactions, leading to increased efficiency and new business models.\u201d\n\nBullish future?\n\nBitcoin already has many believers in its bullish future who are well aware of its advantages, including Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the best-selling personal finance book \u2018Rich Dad Poor Dad,\u2019 who has long argued for Bitcoin as the alternative to the United States dollar, which he considers \u201cfake money\u201d and a threat to the economy.\n\nAt the same time, the maiden crypto has recently hit new multi-month highs and has demonstrated chart patterns and indicators suggesting that another bull run was in play after a period of uncertainty, having kicked off with a potential target of $1 million in the next couple of years, as Finbold reported."

        "content": "After the widely publicized collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), accompanied by two other major banking institutions crashing and more at risk, investors seem to be increasingly flocking to the alternative solution \u2013 cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\n\nAs evident from the declining portion of Bitcoin and Ethereum reserves on crypto exchanges, investors are seeking refuge in these digital assets out of fear that the banking crisis could spread to crypto businesses, as noted by blockchain and financial analysis platform Glassnode in a weekly newsletter sent out on March 13.\n\nSpecifically, the report stated that around \u201c0.144% of all BTC and 0.325% of all ETH in circulation was withdrawn from exchange reserves, demonstrating a similar self-custody response pattern\u201d to the collapse of the crypto trading platform FTX.\n\nBTC and ETH balance on exchanges. Source: Glassnode\n\nOn top of that, the platform\u2019s team stressed that these numbers spoke volumes about the growing level of investor confidence in crypto in recent weeks:\n\n\u201cOn a USD basis, the last month saw over $1.8B in combined BTC and ETH value flow out of exchanges. This is not necessarily large in relative scale. However, observing net exchange withdrawals, especially within the current hostile regulatory environment, does speak to a degree of investor confidence that is worth noting.\u201d\n\nBTC and ETH exchange net position change.
