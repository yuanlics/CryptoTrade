        "content": "Canada dominates the global spot Bitcoin ETF market and might hint at how big US products will be.\n\nJPMorgan analysts said slow growth of Canadian ETFs shows how overblown the US hype is.\n\nAnalyst Eric Balchunas disagrees, and explains why \"it looks pretty good\" for the US.\n\nCanada stamped itself as a pioneer when it approved the world\u2019s first spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund \u2014 the Purpose Bitcoin ETF \u2014 back in February 2021.\n\nThere have been hiccups since, but the funds have seen a resurgence in 2023.\n\nThe Canadian ETF explosion can be used as a proxy for what will follow in the \u201cmassive\u201d US market, Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told DL News.\n\nAssets under management at the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, the world\u2019s largest spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund, soared 60% to over 947 million Canadian dollars this year, according to Cboe Global Markets\u2019 Canadian arm. In US dollars, that\u2019s almost $700 million.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nBalchunas noted that the US ETF market is 32 times that of Canada\u2019s.\n\n\u201cBased on Canada, if you extrapolate, it looks pretty good,\u201d he said.\n\nCanada\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF market share sits at 48% of all global spot crypto ETFs, at around $2 billion in assets, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe global market is worth about $4.2 billion. South of the border, Balchunas has been tracking fund giants BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest and the handful of other firms awaiting spot Bitcoin ETF approval \u2014 expected in January.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nOptimism surrounding a Securities and Exchange Commission nod has helped drive Bitcoin 126% higher this year.\n\nETF performance\n\nCanadian spot ETFs were initially predicted to be a game-changer, but when the Purpose Bitcoin ETF launched in 2021, its performance was underwhelming.\n\nExpected to rise to over $1 billion in assets under management within a week, inflows to Purpose in early weeks went slower than anticipated.\n\nBy April 2022, the ETF had amassed a record $1.7 billion in assets, but that figure was quickly washed away by the Terra collapse in May.\n\nLike many crypto markets, ETFs wallowed through 2022 and only started to recover this January.\n\nIn June, JPMorgan said there was \u201clittle interest\u201d in Canadian ETFs, using it as an example to why the US ETF hype might be overblown.\n\nOthers reject that analysis \u2014 including Balchunas and Canadian regulators.\n\nThe Ontario Securities Commission wrote in a 2023 report that \u201cmuch of the decline in AUM is due to the declining value of cryptocurrencies, rather than significant fund outflows.\u201d\n\nBalchunas noted that crypto ETF flows accounted for 5% of all flows in Canada this year. The increase in assets under management in the market adds up to 23% organic growth, a number Balchunas said is undeniable.\n\n\u201cThe JPMorgan thing baffled me,\u201d Balchunas said.\n\nCanada\u2019s ETF-friendly past\n\nCanada has a history of pushing out ETFs well ahead of the US, as far back as the world\u2019s first ETF, called the TIPs 35 Fund, which launched in 1990.\n\nThe US followed up with the SPY ETF in 1993. Balchunas cites Canada\u2019s first cannabis ETF, launched in 2017, as another example where Canada beat the US to the ETF punch \u2014 it took the US nearly four years to approve a similar product.\n\nBalchunas cites \u201cconservative\u201d regulators in the US, compared to Canada\u2019s \u201cmore liberal\u201d regime.\n\nStill, Balchunas says, the tendency has been for US approval to follow.\n\n\u201cOnce the first ETF in the asset class breaks through, the rest will be approved,\u201d he said.\n\nRoad to SEC approval\n\nPerformance of Canada\u2019s ETFs isn\u2019t the whole story.\n\nThe road to spot ETF approval has not gone smoothly \u2014 the SEC has rejected every application to date, and on Tuesday delayed approval of Franklin Templeton\u2019s proposed ETF.\n\nThe SEC has raised concerns that spot ETFs may be vulnerable to market manipulation and fraud. It has asked the public to express its concerns with such issues.\n\nCanada, on the other hand, approved the crypto ETFs in short order, and has arguably stricter regulatory controls \u2014 the country rolled out a series of rules in 2022, which saw several major crypto firms exit the country, including leading global exchange Binance.\n\n\u201cThe most important difference between Canada and the US right now is regulatory certainty in Canada,\u201d Laure Fouin, partner at Canadian law firm Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, wrote in an email to DL News.\n\nFouin pointed to explicit crypto-related guidance issued by the Canadian Securities Administrators, which included agency expectations for crypto asset funds.\n\nCrypto firms in the US have long advocated for the SEC to produce explicit guidance for crypto assets.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has insisted that existing securities regulations are sufficient.\n\nThe SEC has so far only approved Bitcoin-related funds tied to futures contracts.\n\nTyler Pearson is a Researcher at DL News. If you\u2019ve got a tip on Binance or another story, please reach out at ty@dlnews.com.\n\nA previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt is based in Calgary."

        "title": "Franklin Templeton\u2019s Jenny Johnson on Bitcoin ETFs, investing in crypto, and how her firm is harnessing the blockchain - Fortune",
        "content": "At the Fortune Global Forum Nov. 27\u201329 in Abu Dhabi, I had a chance to talk with Jenny Johnson, the president and CEO of Franklin Templeton, which has grown from a small brokerage founded in 1947 to a global giant that now manages over $1.3 trillion.\n\nAmong the top financial firms, Franklin Templeton has been at the forefront of exploring blockchain technology. In 2021, it launched the first U.S.-registered mutual fund to use a public blockchain to process and record transactions, as well as crypto-focused separately managed accounts, or SMAs. And in September, the firm filed an application for a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIn our conversation, Johnson discusses a variety of topics, including the role blockchain will play in her firm\u2019s long-term success and how it will help democratize markets.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFranklin Templeton has been actively exploring blockchain technology, recently filing an application for its Franklin Bitcoin ETF. Could you elaborate a bit on how blockchain fits into your long-term strategy?\n\nI think it\u2019s important that we differentiate Bitcoin and blockchain. I think that there\u2019s a demand for Bitcoin. It has its own use case, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these ETFs. What gets me more excited, as I think about the future, you look at blockchain technology, and it\u2019s going to enable access to things like private markets. It\u2019s going to enable the democratization of private markets. Well, why does it do that? This is because the technology takes out the frictional costs associated with processing transactions. And if you can reduce the friction in transactions, then you can more easily securitize or fractionalize ownership of things that would have been operationally too difficult to consider. Instead, you\u2019re able to create and transfer ownership of these hard-to-process assets much easier.\n\nIt\u2019s going to unlock nontraditional, non-correlated types of asset classes that are going to be interesting for our clients. We also think that it\u2019s going to make more efficient the types of products that you have today. ETFs trade all day, but only price twice a day. So, imagine that you build a pooled vehicle on the blockchain. When you transact, you can have the smart contract tell you exactly what the underlying value of those securities is. It\u2019s just a much more efficient way to be able to operate.\n\nAnd when you have atomic settlement or you have immediate settlement, it removes the potential for fraud, it takes out latency in the system. It\u2019s going to be all about efficiency. At Franklin Templeton, we developed a tokenized money-market fund. We built a shareholder recordkeeping system on that. We are a node validator, we actually advise on different portfolios. We have passive portfolios and active portfolios. While these are all in their early stages, they demonstrate that we\u2019re big believers in this space.\n\nWhen do you think the first Bitcoin spot ETF will be approved?\n\nI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s in the hands of the regulators, as they\u2019re trying to figure out the best approach. Their job is to protect the consumers, and I think they\u2019ll do it in time, as appropriate.\n\nHave you seen significant interest from clients for a Bitcoin spot ETF? Do you expect an influx of funds after it is approved?\n\nI think there\u2019s obviously a demand for Bitcoin, and I believe a spot ETF is a better way to access Bitcoin. As long as they trade, the bid-ask is narrow, it should be a better way to do it. It\u2019s a much more convenient way for anybody interested in investing in Bitcoin.\n\nBut I think Bitcoin has some challenges. It\u2019s hard to anchor to any kind of investment thesis. It tends to be a risk-on/risk-off type of asset. You just want to make sure clients are responsible in how they allocate Bitcoin.\n\nHow did you first discover blockchain and crypto?\n\nI ran the technology division years ago at Franklin Templeton. So I\u2019m always staying focused on new technological trends. This was one that I thought initially would take longer to mature, but I\u2019ve been impressed to see the various platforms and how quickly they\u2019ve matured, and the innovation that\u2019s happened in various companies that are being created on these layer-1s. But it was just because I spent about a third of my time on disruptive technologies, and it was one, just like AI, that I paid attention to.\n\nDo you personally invest in cryptocurrency?\n\nI do have some investments. It\u2019s small for my overall portfolio, but I definitely have investments there.\n\nCan you share some of your picks?\n\nWell, I haven\u2019t had more picks. They\u2019re all standard: Ethereum, a little Bitcoin, SushiSwap, Uniswap. I have a couple of different things like that.\n\nLooking ahead, do you plan to launch other blockchain- or crypto-related products? Some other wealth managers have, for example, crypto indexes or retirement plans or futures ETFs.\n\nETFs don\u2019t tend to be big in the retirement channel, but they may. Retirement plans have fiduciaries that make the decision about what investments are on there. So that would be the choice of the fiduciary. Our job is to make the products available.\n\nYou\u2019ve had big success with your U.S. money-market fund, which is tokenized and has inflows of over $ 270 million. Do you plan to tokenize any other funds?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I think that technology is a really great opportunity. And as it matures, there\u2019ll be more investment opportunities. I always say, at Franklin Templeton, our expertise is in making active, risk-adjusted investment decisions, and we deliver them in whatever vehicle our clients would like us to deliver them. Blockchain creates one type of vehicle with tokenization, and so, yes, we do see it as a channel to ultimately be able to deliver our expertise.\n\nFranklin Templeton ventured into the world of NFTs by issuing some to attendees of your first Innovation Forum last year. What use cases do you see for NFTs, and how do you feel about them personally?\n\nLook, I think as in anything, there\u2019s mature investments that make a lot of sense. And then there\u2019s a lot that don\u2019t make any sense. I tend to make investments in things that I think are anchored in having financial returns, because I think that you have better chances of success there. There are some things that are like art in an NFT, where if two people love it, they will find a market price for it. And so, there\u2019s going to be opportunities in that space. Not all will be successful, not all will be good, but there will be some that are successful."

        "content": "Bitcoin is again inching closer to a potential price breakout, even as it hovers at its highest point in 18 months.\n\nMarkets priced bitcoin (BTC) above $38,600 on Friday morning \u2014 up 9% over the past month and more than double since this time last year.\n\nNumber-two crypto ether (ETH) is meanwhile playing catch-up. It\u2019s also at its highest point since mid-last year, but trails bitcoin\u2019s returns by nearly half.\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio (the bitcoin cost of ether) has fallen by one-fifth over the past six months. It\u2019s showing signs of closing the gap, however, having regained almost 4.5% in November.\n\nBitcoin bulls may explain the crypto\u2019s strength with hype around spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 like the one BlackRock wants to launch \u2014 which could be approved any day now.\n\nThose ETFs will be forced to buy BTC to meet investor demand, representing perhaps billions in upward pressure. They might even reason that the DOJ\u2019s indictment of Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao gives a certain clarity to the crypto market that can only be good for prices.\n\nCrypto investors could even feel a little floaty due to arrests of hombres like FTX fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, Terra ringleader Do Kwon and Celsius rabble-rouser Alex Mashinsky.\n\nSo, the tide went out, took the bad actors with it and now billions in fresh ETF money might wash ashore, bringing the bull market back along with it, some might say.\n\nThe ETH/BTC ratio has even underperformed BNB over the past year\n\nBears would say it\u2019s unclear whether ETFs would actually move the needle, considering the relatively small interest in the three spot funds already available to North American investors via Canadian markets.\n\nA fresh wave of spot ETFs could even be bad for bitcoin\u2019s price, especially if Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) loses ground to Wall Street operators like BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou reckons up to $2.7 billion might flow out of GBTC and potentially be dumped on the market.\n\nStill, by some definitions, the bear market is squarely over. That doesn\u2019t explicitly mean the start of a new bull market.\n\nAlthough momentum does count for something, and if Bitcoin went up in November, could it do the same in December?\n\nIt turns out Bitcoin\u2019s price direction in December has matched November 10 times in its 13 years of existence, with only 2011, 2013, and 2014 not aligning \u2014 a 77% strike rate, per TradingView data.\n\nThat\u2019s more common than with months overall: 94 of the 170 months on record, or 56%, have aligned with the previous month\u2019s candle.\n\nAll this is probably statistically insignificant, on par with roulette math, given the small sample size.\n\nBut considering the crypto winter we\u2019ve had, markets will take what they can get.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "One Bitcoin transaction uses as much water as filling a swimming pool - Earth.com",
        "content": "In a recent commentary, financial economist Alex de Vries has raised concerns about the significant amount of water consumed by cryptocurrency mining, particularly Bitcoin. This extensive water usage poses a threat to the global water supply, especially in water-scarce regions.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s water consumption\n\nDe Vries, a PhD student at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, highlights the burgeoning issue of Bitcoin\u2019s water footprint. \u201cMany parts of the world are experiencing droughts, and fresh water is becoming an increasing scarce resource,\u201d says de Vries (@Digiconomist). \u201cIf we continue to use this valuable resource for making useless computations, I think that reality is really painful.\u201d\n\nHistorically, the focus on cryptocurrency\u2019s environmental impact centered around its electricity consumption. Miners around the world actively compete to solve mathematical equations on the internet when mining Bitcoins, the most popular cryptocurrency. The winners receive a share of Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\n\u201cThe right answer emerges every 10 minutes, and the rest of the data, quintillions of them, are computations that serve no further purpose and are therefore immediately discarded,\u201d de Vries says.\n\nIn the Bitcoin network, miners collectively generate about 350 quintillion guesses every second of the day, equating to 350 followed by 18 zeros. This process consumes a tremendous amount of computing power.\n\nQuantifying the impact\n\nDuring the mining process, large data centers use a significant amount of water to cool their computers. Alex de Vries, drawing on previous research data, estimates that Bitcoin mining in the U.S. consumes about 8.6 to 35.1 gigaliters (GL) of water annually from data centers.\n\nAdditionally, coal- and gas-fired power plants, which supply the electricity for these computers, also utilize water to cool down. This water, once used for cooling, evaporates and becomes unavailable for reuse. Similarly, water that evaporates from hydropower plants contributes to the overall water footprint of Bitcoin\u2019s power requirements.\n\nDe Vries estimates that Bitcoin mining used over 1,600 gigaliters (GL) of water globally in 2021. On average, each transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain consumes 16,000 liters of water, which is about 6.2 million times more than a credit card swipe, or sufficient to fill a backyard swimming pool. De Vries predicts that Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption will rise to 2,300 GL by 2023.\n\n\u201cThe price of Bitcoin just increased recently and reached its highest point of the year, despite the recent collapse of several cryptocurrency platforms. This will have serious consequences, because the higher the price, the higher the environmental impact,\u201d de Vries explains.\n\nThe environmental toll is exacerbated by the fact that these resources are not utilized for productive purposes like artificial intelligence but are instead expended on \u201cuseless computations.\u201d\n\nRegional implications\n\nCountries like Kazakhstan, a major hub for cryptocurrency mining, are already facing water shortages. In 2021, Bitcoin transactions in Kazakhstan accounted for 997.9 GL of water, adding to the country\u2019s water crisis.\n\nIn the U.S., the annual water consumption for Bitcoin mining, from all sources combined, ranges between 93 GL to 120 GL. This is equivalent to the water usage of 300,000 American households or a city like Washington, D.C.\n\nde Vries says. \u201cThe most painful thing about cryptocurrency mining is that it uses so much computational power and so much resources, but these resources are not going into creating some kind of model, like artificial intelligence, that you can then use for something else. It\u2019s just making useless computations.\u201d\n\nAddressing the challenge\n\nDe Vries suggests potential solutions, such as modifying Bitcoin mining\u2019s software to reduce power and water requirements. He also proposes incorporating renewable energy sources like wind and solar to lessen the water footprint. However, he cautions against diverting limited renewable resources to cryptocurrency mining at the expense of other essential uses.\n\n\u201cBut do you really want to spend wind and solar power for crypto? In many countries including the U.S., the amount of renewable energy is limited. Sure you can move some of these renewable energy sources to crypto, but that means something else will be powered with fossil fuels. I\u2019m not sure how much you gain,\u201d he says.\n\nWater, Bitcoin, and the future\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s value continues to grow, so does its environmental footprint. De Vries predicts that Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption will increase to 2,300 GL by 2023. This growing demand for water in the mining process could further exacerbate the global water crisis, especially in drought-prone areas.\n\nIn summary, the revelation of Bitcoin\u2019s significant water footprint by Alex de Vries serves as a wake-up call to the environmental implications of cryptocurrency mining. As the world grapples with water scarcity, the need for sustainable and responsible use of resources becomes more pressing.\n\nDe Vries\u2019s research underscores the importance of reassessing the environmental costs of emerging technologies like Bitcoin and seeking solutions that align with global sustainability goals.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Cell Reports Sustainability.\n\n\u2014\n\nLike what you read?

        "title": "Unveiling Bitcoin's price drivers: Key knowledge for Wisconsin residents - La Crosse Tribune",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is the world's most popular digital currency, and in contrast to flat currencies like the dollar, pound, yen, and euro, it isn't issued by any government. So, how is Bitcoin valued? This article will explore the price drivers behind the digital coin, such as supply and demand, regulation, cost of production, and news and competition, highlighting why these factors make Bitcoin a volatile asset for investors in Wisconsin and the United States.\n\nBitcoin price dynamics: supply and demand impact\n\nSupply and demand will be familiar to those with an economic background. However, if this term seems alien to you, this explanation will help you understand how this concept directly affects the price of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market. For example, supply and demand work together to determine the quantity of a specific commodity and its market price. As this price increases, the demand for economic goods declines. This means sellers will create more of the commodity or vice-versa. This dynamic holds for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, just like it does for the spot price of commodities (such as oil) that use flat exchange rates, for example, USD to GBP.\n\nImpact of competitive markets and news on Bitcoin\n\nWith cryptocurrencies becoming ever-more popular worldwide, Bitcoin has seen an influx of competition to its throne as the go-to crypto, which affects its price. Altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) have given investors plenty of ways to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolios. For example, any improvements to an altcoin like Ethereum may see Bitcoin's price plummet. Furthermore, media attention can fuel speculation and turn up price volatility. For instance, negative press surrounding cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, can lead to panic-selling by some Bitcoin owners, ultimately driving its price down. Alternatively, the inverse is also true, and positive news surrounding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies can move its price upwards.\n\nImpact of accessibility and liquidity on Bitcoin prices\n\nThe accessibility of Bitcoin will significantly influence its price now and in the future. For example, the more widely adopted Bitcoin becomes, the more valuable it will be. For instance, crypto-friendly governments and countries like Switzerland, the first country to offer crypto companies business accounts in 2018, will positively affect Bitcoin's price. Furthermore, liquidity is something to consider when analyzing the price drivers behind Bitcoin. This is because Bitcoin is regarded as the most liquid cryptocurrency currently available to investors; why? Because it can be easily bought and sold on exchanges and converted for cash. While liquidity is often good for price stability, it's important to remember that changes in liquidity can cause Bitcoin prices to swing.\n\nBitcoin price drivers: risks and investing insights\n\nAnother factor that can affect Bitcoin's price is risks that may affect its supply and demand. For example, due to its digital nature, Bitcoin can be prone to events such as cyber-attacks. For instance, individuals' crypto wallets or the exchanges they hold Bitcoin on may get hacked, creating instability in Bitcoin's price. Moreover, regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin vary in different countries and states in the US. This means there is always a chance that laws may be passed that could nationally and internationally affect the ownership of Bitcoin and its liquidity. However, rules and regulations set by governments can lead to surges in Bitcoin prices; for instance, cryptocurrency groups are expanding in Hong Kong due to the rules and restrictions placed upon digital currencies in mainland China.\n\nFinal notes: unveiling Bitcoin's price drivers\n\nInvestors in Wisconsin and the United States must note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and influenced by government regulations, liquidity, competition between digital currencies, news surrounding cryptocurrencies, and supply and demand. In turn, this makes predicting the exact price movements of Bitcoin challenging; however, improvements in scalability, security, and privacy features may increase confidence in Bitcoin and make it a more appealing investment for a bigger audience in the future.\n\nInformation on this website is intended for educational purposes only and is not to be used as investment advice.

        "title": "Could Bitcoin Be Worth More Than $1 Trillion in 2024? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "With Bitcoin (BTC -3.76%) up more than 125% this year, it's becoming increasingly possible that this high-flying crypto might surge through the $1 trillion valuation mark sometime next year. Given Bitcoin's circulating supply of roughly 20 million coins, a valuation of $1 trillion implies a price of about $50,000. This represents a 30% gain from today's price of almost $38,000.\n\nThat price target certainly seems possible, given that it wouldn't even require Bitcoin to regain its all-time high of almost $69,000. Could Bitcoin rally to $50,000 and top a $1 trillion valuation in the coming months? Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF factor\n\nBitcoin's current rally has been driven, to a large extent, by investor anticipation of the first-ever spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the U.S. market. In June, BlackRock led the way with a spot Bitcoin ETF application. Within the span of just a few weeks, a handful of other large institutional investors were also lining up with their own spot Bitcoin ETF applications. The current thinking is that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could give its final approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF sometime in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThere are a number of useful back-of-the-envelope calculations that can be used to assess the impact of this approval. The easiest approach is to add up all the assets under management of the large institutional investors applying for these spot Bitcoin ETFs, and apply a scaling factor of, say, 1% to that number. That tells you how much new money might be flowing into Bitcoin. For example, if you assume that institutional investors will allocate just 1% of their $5 trillion in assets under management to Bitcoin, that would result in a new influx of $50 billion into Bitcoin.\n\nAnother approach is to consider Bitcoin from the perspective of a precious metal. Bitcoin is often described as \"digital gold,\" and many investors view it as a store of value, similar to physical gold. Thus, it's not out of the realm of possibility to think that some investors might move their assets out of precious metals and into Bitcoin. Right now, about $120 billion is held in precious metals ETFs. So, if you assume that anywhere from 10% to 20% of that might be reallocated to Bitcoin, that would result in a potential influx of anywhere from $12 billion to $24 billion. This new flow of money, presumably, would help to bid up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe global growth factor\n\nYou're probably thinking, \"That sounds great, but hasn't the market already priced in some, if not most, of the impact of a spot Bitcoin ETF?\" If you believe in the efficient market hypothesis, which says that the market has already priced in all known information, then you could be right. Coinbase Global, for example, has already run the numbers and concluded that some of the spot Bitcoin ETF impact might already have been priced in.\n\nThat's why I have a second big reason Bitcoin could rally to $50,000 and beyond in 2024: the global growth factor. In short, Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly important part of the world's financial system, and that is leading to new demand for Bitcoin as an asset.\n\nIn its Big Ideas report for 2023, Ark Invest shared its forecast for several different market segments where it saw Bitcoin building momentum worldwide. By estimating how much of each market segment Bitcoin might command in the future, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest came up with a base, bear, and bull case scenario for Bitcoin for the year 2030.\n\nFor example, Wood calculated that, in a base case scenario, Bitcoin might account for 3% of the M2 money supply of emerging market countries, and 2.5% of the portfolio allocation of institutional investors. All of that led to a base case forecast of $682,800 for Bitcoin. So even if you dial back some of these numbers (such as changing the portfolio allocation percentage from 2.5% to 1%), you're still going to get a huge number. The bear case scenario for Bitcoin, says Wood, calls for a price of $258,500 by the year 2030.\n\nCan Bitcoin reach $50,000?\n\nGiven the above, I don't think $50,000 is an outlandish price target for Bitcoin. Especially given the fact that some analysts are already projecting that Bitcoin could top $100,000 by the end of 2024. Standard Chartered Bank, for example, recently doubled down on a $100,000 price target for Bitcoin.\n\nAt today's prices, a target of $50,000 requires only a 30% rise for Bitcoin. If you consider all the money that could be flowing into Bitcoin as a result of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, and then layer on top of that the overall growth that Bitcoin is seeing on a global basis, then Bitcoin might actually hit a $1 trillion market valuation in 2024. Just keep in mind, though, that given Bitcoin's historical volatility, that path to $1 trillion is likely to be filled with a bit of turbulence along the way. So buckle up."

        "content": "November was perhaps the most significant month of this year for the crypto industry and gave bitcoin a strong setup as investors look toward 2024. Bitcoin ended the month up about 9%, according to Coin Metrics. It was the underperformer, however, compared to ether , which advanced 13%, and Solana's sol token, which jumped 63%. Investors found relief after FTX's disgraced leader Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of criminal fraud \u2014 just about a year after the short-lived exchange's spectacular collapse \u2014 and the CEO of Binance, the largest exchange in the world, pleaded guilty to charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. For many, these events allowed them to close a painful chapter of crypto history as it prepares to open a new one. If a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund gets approved soon, it could bring a wave of new investors into the market who have been sitting on the sidelines waiting for the industry to clean up. BTC.CM= 1M mountain Bitcoin closes November up 9% Now, traders are waiting in earnest. \"It's safe to say that the market is grinding higher in anticipation of a spot bitcoin ETF approval in January,\" said Ryan Rasmussen, research analyst at Bitwise Asset Management. \"There's also the next bitcoin halving set to occur in May 2024, which is a strong catalyst for price that most people are missing as they're hyper-focused on a spot bitcoin ETF.\" \"Some investors will continue trying to front-run the potential spot bitcoin ETF approval, but December is essentially a 'wait and see' period for bitcoin,\" he said. Broad consensus is that an ETF is likely to be approved soon. Part of what's driving that optimism is reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has long held a reputation for being dismissive or unengaging with the crypto industry, appeared to make greater efforts in November by holding closed-door discussions with several ETF filers, giving them feedback and meeting with them again . November is a historically strong month for bitcoin. This is its seventh positive one out of the 11 since its inception, according to CoinGlass. December's track record isn't as rosy, however. CoinGlass says it has ended in the green in just four of the past 10. This year, however, it may give investors a good opportunity to buy one more dip before key events play out in the beginning of 2024. According to Wolfe Research, \"all signs\" point toward a near-term pullback in bitcoin's price, though there's plenty of upside left for it to run. November gains bring bitcoin up about 127% for 2023. Ether and sol have gained 70% and 482%, respectively, for the year. \"While this is part of a rotation we often see \u2014 a bitcoin rally, followed by an Ethereum rally, followed by a rally in altcoins \u2014 it's a telling signal for where we are in this next crypto cycle,\" Rasmussen said. \"It tells us that investors are interested in more than just the potential for a spot bitcoin ETF. They're looking ahead to 2024 and focusing on other narratives [and] recognize the potential for crypto to gain a meaningful share of investor attention next year.\""

According to Alex de Vries from the Vrihe Universiteit Amsterdam, the study's sole author, that's around six million times more than what you use buying something with a credit card.\n\n\"It's sort of hard to surprise me, given how I've already worked on this topic I'm kind of used to big numbers popping up,\" de Vries told The Verge. \"But then again, the numbers are still mind blowing even to me every time I look at it.\"\n\nCool It\n\nGlobally, Bitcoin mining used about 1,600 gigaliters \u2014 that's a billion liters times 1,600 \u2014 in 2021, and the figure could be upwards of 2,200 gigaliters this year, with the US alone accounting for up to 35 gigaliters of that consumption. The steep increase will likely be driven by Bitcoin's climbing value, which encourages more mining.\n\nAn enormous amount of water is used to cool the tireless computers that mine and process Bitcoin around the clock.

Most of its water footprint comes from the water used in generating the electricity that Bitcoin burns through, though cooling systems still formed a massive part of the total proportion.\n\nLowering the Stakes\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way, according to de Vries. Most cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin use what's known as \"proof of work\" to validate transactions on the blockchain \u2014 the \"work\" being the mining done by those toasty computers \u2014 which is wildly inefficient.\n\n\"You have millions of devices around the world, constantly competing with each other in a massive game of what I like to describe as 'guess the number,'\" de Vries told the BBC. \"All of these machines combined are generating 500 quintillion guesses every second of the day, non stop \u2014 that is 500 with 18 zeros behind it.\"\n\nThere is at least one major cryptocurrency, however, that works around this: Ethereum, which last year started using \"proof of stake\" instead of work to validate transactions without any mining whatsoever, cutting its energy bill by 99 percent.\n\nShort of ditching crypto entirely, switching them over to more efficient systems could cause \"all the electricity consumption\" and \"associated water consumption\" to \"disappear overnight,\" de Vries told The Verge.\n\nBeyond that, using renewables and switching over to cooling methods that either recycle or don't use water at all could help soften crypto mining's grim environmental toll.\n\nMore on crypto: Execs of Top Meme Coin Charged With Spending Customers' Money on Luxury Cars"

        "content": "BTC was down by nearly 1% over the last 24 hours.\n\nSocial metrics were high, but other indicators looked bearish.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] has not been very volatile of late, as its price took a sideways trajectory. As AMBCrypto reported earlier, investors might have to expect a few more slow-moving days, which was further established by the latest datasets.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin\u2019s MACD and Money Flow Index (MFI) looked bearish. But can anything cause a change in the trend in the near term?\n\nBitcoin might not get volatile\n\nIntoTheBlock recently posted a tweet highlighting that the 30-day average intraday move for Bitcoin was going lower than traditional markets. This indicated a period of relatively low volatility for BTC.\n\nMoreover, AMBCrypto found that while BTC\u2019s price went sideways, its Open Interest remained relatively high. High Open Interest generally indicates that the ongoing price trend might continue further.\n\nHas anything changed overnight?\n\nThough BTC did not register much movement, investors continued to accumulate at press time. This was evident from the fact that BTC\u2019s Exchange Outflow spiked in the recent past.\n\nOn top of that, BTC\u2019s Supply on Exchanges remained lower than its Supply outside of Exchanges, suggesting that buying pressure on the coin was higher than selling pressure, reflecting investors\u2019 confidence in the king of cryptos.\n\nThings looked good for BTC on the social front too, as its Social Dominance surged by more than 50% over the last week. But despite the sluggish price movement, Bitcoin\u2019s Market Dominance registered an increase, which looked optimistic.\n\nHowever, a bearish metric was the coin\u2019s AltRank, which increased over the last seven days.\n\nWhen AMBCrypto checked BTC\u2019s daily chart, we found that not much had changed over the last few hours. The MACD continued to show an ongoing tussle between the bulls and the bears at press time.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe Bollinger Bands\u2019 data also revealed that the coin\u2019s price was in a less volatile zone.\n\nHowever, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) went sideways, but its Money Flow Index (MFI) looked bullish as it moved up slightly in the recent past. At press time, BTC was trading at $37,787.55, with a market capitalization of over $739 billion."

        "title": "How the Winklevoss Twins' Bitcoin-Based Second Act Went Bad - New York Magazine",
        "content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty\n\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York\u2019s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nIn early June 2019, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss invited the author Ben Mezrich to a private get-together at the Park Avenue South headquarters of their crypto exchange, Gemini, an office where the money and ambition of the digital currency world were on outlandish display: A giant chrome statue reminiscent of the MTV Moon Man trophy hung from the ceiling; employees were called \u201castronauts\u201d; the C-suite was referred to as \u201cmission control.\u201d Mezrich, of course, was a key figure in the Winklevosses\u2019 lives. As the author of The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal \u2014 the 2009 book that became The Social Network \u2014 he had helped define them, before their 30th birthdays, as spoiled Ivy League monozygotic brats who got rich thanks to their dad\u2019s lawyer. \u201cThe Winklevii aren\u2019t suing me for intellectual property theft,\u201d Jesse Eisenberg, playing the Mark Zuckerberg character, says in one of the movie\u2019s key lines. \u201cThey are suing me because, for the first time in their lives, things didn\u2019t go exactly the way they were supposed to for them.\u201d\n\nYet, ten years later, Mezrich was hawking his new book, Bitcoin Billionaires: A True Story of Genius, Betrayal, and Redemption, casting the twins as heroes \u2014 to their own employees. \u201cThat was a weird day,\u201d one onlooker said. Attendance was optional, but the midday event did have pizza, and who doesn\u2019t love pizza, so dozens showed up. The twins seemed relaxed, far from their normally stiff selves, two others said. \u201cI remember them asking what Ben\u2019s process was, and him saying, \u2019I write books I can turn into movies,\u2019\u201d a fourth attendee said. What was so strange about the whole thing is that Mezrich\u2019s book hardly even mentions Gemini. Then, after it was all over, the twins asked their employees to grab a free copy and form a line, so all three of them \u2014 the author and his dual protagonists \u2014 could all sign the book.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins have, for the better part of a decade, been trying to convince the world they made a comeback. For anyone who stopped paying attention to them after the Facebook movie came out, here\u2019s the general trajectory: The $65 million settlement from Zuckerberg over their claims to the Facebook idea turned into a major bet on bitcoin, back when the digital currency traded for about $8. (Lately it trades around $38,000.) Gemini, which they started in 2014, was supposed to be their legacy \u2014 a highly profitable business that would not only cement their status as serious players in the growing crypto industry. If everything went right, it had the potential to be a $100 billion company of their own. In an often sketchy or even scammy sector plagued by hacks and FBI raids, they branded themselves as rule followers using financial best practices to create a dependable \u201cnext generation\u201d exchange that wealthy investors and institutions could rely on as they got involved in crypto investing. They would be the kind of entrepreneurs who would work with government regulators even as much of the rest of the industry tried to avoid oversight. \u201cIn the beginning of Gemini\u2019s history, we were very focused on asking permission, and not asking for forgiveness,\u201d a former executive said. \u201cWe always acted on the expectation of how regulators would want us to work.\u201d\n\nGemini is, of course, a reference to twins, as well as a NASA space flight \u2014 but any astrologer could tell you that geminis have a tendency for saying one thing and doing another. Last month, New York Attorney General Letitia James sued the Winklevosses\u2019 exchange, claiming that it defrauded 290,000 people out of $1.1 billion worth of crypto. The suit presented a company that was not only willing to overlook its own internal concerns about a partner firm that was holding a huge chunk of its customers\u2019 deposits but to continue representing to those customers that their money was secure even as the board was privately comparing this partner to Lehman Brothers in 2008. Interviews with nine sources, together with court records, reveal a company that began taking larger and larger risks as it attempted to keep up with competitors like FTX and Binance, both of which later ran spectacularly afoul of law. (None of the sources are being named since they continue to work in the industry and fear getting sued for talking about the companies.) That frantic chase is said to have led Gemini to stray from the rule-following conservatism that was the original cornerstone of the brand. Now that they\u2019ve been accused of lying to their customers \u2014 and their exchange has fallen out of the top 100 by global trading volume \u2014 the twins are facing the most consequential test to their credibility yet.\n\nAfter their famous Facebook settlement, the Winklevosses made some questionable investments. There was Treats!, a porn magazine, in 2014. There was Hukkster, an online retailer, soon after. Cameron co-founded \u201cGuest of a Guest,\u201d a \u201cPage Six\u201d knockoff. But their bitcoin bet was an unqualified jackpot. As Mezrich describes in his more recent book, it began at an Ibiza foam party called F@@k Me I\u2019m Famous. A man they\u2019d never met buttonholed them about \u201cthe oldest social network on earth.\u201d He was talking about money, specifically in the form of the digital currency, and the twins were hooked. They bought up about 1 percent of all the bitcoin in the world. At first, they tried to turn their investment into a kind of company of its own, the world\u2019s first exchange-traded fund for bitcoins. This would give the investing public an easy way to make the digital currency part of their 401(k)s \u2014 all for a small fee \u2014 but their applications were repeatedly denied by federal regulators.\n\nStill, Gemini was their biggest idea. Following the 2014 debacle of Mt. Gox \u2014 the largest bitcoin exchange in the world until it was hacked and robbed \u2014 there was a strong appetite for reliable crypto companies. \u201cIt was super exciting,\u201d an early executive said of Gemini\u2019s formative years. \u201cI was working my ass off and I loved it.\u201d Early on, the twins went out of their way to involve the New York Department of Financial Services, a historically nosy Wall Street regulator, and by 2015 would be one of the first to get a charter allowing it to operate in the state.\n\nThe business plan was to be one step ahead of Wall Street. As the hedge funds and Goldman Sachses of the world discovered crypto, the thinking went, Gemini would already be there, an inviting gateway into this new realm. Gemini was scrupulous about following the rules, employees said. In addition to working with New York regulators, the Winklevoss brothers would fly to Europe to meet with the financial authorities there. Gemini\u2019s ad campaigns had taglines like \u201cCrypto Without Chaos\u201d and \u201cThe Revolution Needs Rules.\u201d Whenever Gemini wanted to list a new digital currency for customers to trade, it informed the Department of Financial Services ahead of time, giving the regulators the chance to register an objection. Most times, DFS officials would either approve the request or decline to act against them \u2014 which, in effect, was seen to be the same thing, according to people familiar with the inner workings of the company. Generally, this plan worked. By 2019, Gemini had captured about 5 percent of the U.S. crypto exchange market \u2014 a small, but valuable, slice of a rich new industry.\n\nIn a wonderful twist of irony, Gemini nearly captured the business of a certain blockbuster client: Zuckerberg. Starting in 2018, the Facebook founder wanted to launch his own cryptocurrency, called Libra. At one point, according to three people directly familiar with the plans, Libra\u2019s parent company was preparing to issue the digital currency through Gemini. Gemini employees had figured that DFS regulators were fine with it after hearing nothing back from a proposal. \u201cIt technically was approved,\u201d said one person. The PR value of the plan would have been hard to overstate \u2014 here were the twins, getting back into business with their onetime nemesis, letting bygones go on a grand quest to get insanely rich. It was only after informing regulators again \u2014 extra safe, by the rules \u2014 that they raised concerns about the launch. Libra encountered further regulatory scrutiny after that, particularly on concerns that Facebook was too big, and was quietly euthanized in 2022.\n\nIn the months preceding the pandemic, ex-employees told me, something began to change. Their market share was not growing. Their biggest U.S. competitor, Coinbase, was becoming the go-to exchange. \u201cWe felt like we were missing out,\u201d one ex-employee said. Abroad, the growth was even bigger. Binance, which had no headquarters (and thus no obvious regulatory obligations), had cemented itself as the world\u2019s largest exchange. Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX was also growing rapidly from its offshore outpost in Hong Kong, before relocating to an even friendlier jurisdiction in the Bahamas (where it would commit its epic $14 billion fraud). Inside Gemini, the bet on institutional customers appeared to be going nowhere. Goldman wasn\u2019t giving them real business, and they were getting as much as they\u2019d hoped from hedge funds, insiders said.\n\nIn 2020, the twins decided it was time for a pivot. They no longer wanted Gemini to be just an exchange where customers traded crypto. Instead, it would look more like a consumer bank, selling lots of financial products \u2014 credit cards, bank accounts, maybe even mortgages, one ex-employee said. At the center of that was a top-secret project called Earn, which would basically act like a high-yield checking account, except for crypto holdings instead of cash. \u201cWe would have this savings-like account. That\u2019s how we viewed it internally, even though we never ever say that publicly anywhere, because we knew that we weren\u2019t allowed to say that,\u201d one person directly involved with the program said. It was an aggressive move to offer the general public a brand new interest-bearing product without clear regulatory approval \u2014 and this time Gemini didn\u2019t ask the Department of Financial Services for permission ahead of time, according to two people familiar with the approval process. To knowledgeable observers in the crypto world, the logic of the Winklevosses\u2019 strategy shift toward riskier and more aggressive product offerings was obvious enough. \u201cThey were hemorrhaging market share,\u201d said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin, a digital currency financial services company. \u201cIn an effort to stay alive, they basically did exactly what SBF did, which was go after retail deposits.\u201d\n\nEarn worked by, essentially, connecting Gemini\u2019s generally conservative customers and some of crypto\u2019s wildest risk-takers. Gemini depositors could opt to put their crypto (say, their bitcoin or ethereum) in a special account that would pay them interest \u2014 as much as an 8 percent annualized \u2014 on the balance. For many depositors, it seemed like an easy way to make a little extra income while they waited for their crypto bags to moon. But, of course, the yield had to come from somewhere. At a traditional bank, a checking account yield comes from the bank lending out those same funds at a higher rate of interest. In the case of Earn, Gemini would lend out their customers\u2019 crypto to other players in the industry (with crypto speculation at a fever pitch, there was a strong institutional demand to borrow crypto for trading) for a higher rate of interest than it ultimately paid to its customers. If everything went smoothly, it was win-win.\n\nInside Gemini, people involved said, the whole process of setting up the program took nearly a year, and involved intense debates about what kind of interest rates they should offer and whether they should lend out the crypto to multiple partners or only one. Gemini\u2019s product managers considered partnering with a handful of lenders, including two companies that were successful doing what Earn aimed to do, paying retail investors interest on their crypto holdings by lending them other institutions. One was BlockFi, a firm that the twins had already invested in. The other was Celsius, a competitor. While the two firms appeared to be doing very well during the crypto bull market of 2020 and 2021, both would collapse in 2022 with their customers losing everything they had deposited. (Celsius\u2019s founder, Alex Mashinsky, has since been charged with criminal fraud, and his trial is set for September 2024.)\n\nWhen Earn was publicly announced in February 2021, Gemini\u2019s press release did not mention any lending partner and instead touted its own safety and reliability \u201con par with those offered by top financial institutions,\u201d the company said. The company it chose as a partner was Genesis Trading, a big institutional player in the crypto space. Like Gemini, it was based in New York City and a related entity, Genesis Capital, was regulated by state watchdogs. Genesis was also a subsidiary of one of the companies that helped create the crypto industry, Digital Currency Group. The parent company was sitting on the world\u2019s largest bitcoin horde (over 600,000 of them, held as part of a lucrative publicly tradable product called the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust). Because Genesis was overseen by such a big moneymaker \u2014 DCG booked more than $1 billion in revenue in 2021 \u2014 it was considered about as creditworthy as you could get in the crypto business.\n\nEarn was a surprise hit and quickly became the Winklevoss twins\u2019 biggest product. In the first two weeks, according to internal metrics, it brought in $500 million in deposits; a month later, Gemini had made $1 million in fees. By June, the internal data showed, 73 percent of the customers had 99 percent of their money in Earn. Gemini depositors loved it because they earn high interest rates for doing basically nothing, all while working with the \u201ccrypto without the chaos\u201d company. \u201cGemini has always had a reputation for being a trustworthy and secure platform,\u201d said one Earn depositor, Glen, who asked to have his full name withheld for security reasons and because his family doesn\u2019t know. \u201cI trusted Gemini and assumed that any partnerships they had would be equally trustworthy.\u201d On the back of that success and a booming market generally for all things crypto, Gemini reached a valuation topping $7 billion. The twins made the Forbes billionaires list, with $6 billion between them.\n\nStill, some Gemini employees were concerned. They thought that the crypto industry was too dependent on Genesis remaining stable and managing its risks intelligently. For skeptics, it looked like it could be a systemic point of failure in a larger crypto collapse. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know that Genesis was the counterparty to every interest-bearing crypto product, you were not paying attention,\u201d one former Gemini employee told me. But an executive overseeing the project \u201cwould repeatedly say that he thought that their financials were very strong and that they are blue chip or whatever. He seemed to think that they were trustworthy.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Genesis Trading wasn\u2019t trustworthy. Internal records revealed during the criminal trial of Bankman-Fried showed that Genesis didn\u2019t play by anything resembling the rules of a traditional financial firm. For instance, the company routinely approved billions of dollars in loans over Signal chats. One former loan officer said that confidential information was kept unsecured on the company\u2019s servers. \u201cOur credit risk team was a sham. I don\u2019t know what they were doing,\u201d said another ex-employee. \u201cThey had no risk reporting at all,\u201d said a third. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a way to look at the portfolio very easily.\u201d By early 2022, Genesis had discovered that about 60 percent of all its loans were concentrated in Bankman-Fried\u2019s hedge fund, Alameda Research \u2013 which, of course, would blow up spectacularly before the end of the year.\n\nGemini was not unaware of the risks it was taking by parking a huge chunk of its customers\u2019 funds with Genesis, according to ex-employees and court documents. The attorney general\u2019s office alleged that Gemini\u2019s risk team had downgraded Genesis\u2019s risk level to junk status by February 2022. In the spring of that year, a Genesis employee privately met with Jared Shaw, Gemini\u2019s head of finance, to tell him about how concentrated Genesis was in Alameda. (Shaw hadn\u2019t responded to a request for comment prior to publication. Afterwards, he said \u201cI had no private meetings or met with anyone at Genesis while at Gemini.\u201d)\n\nAs 2022 rolled on, everything was starting to come apart \u2014 fast. In May, two of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrencies, TerraUSD and Luna, collapsed, instantly evaporating $60 billion from the larger crypto economy. A month later, the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital went under, defaulting on more than $3 billion in obligations \u2014 including $2.3 billion in loans from Genesis, according to court records. According to the attorney general\u2019s suit, this nearly led to Genesis\u2019s bankruptcy. DCG, its parent company, issued a promissory note that appeared to plug a $1.1 billion hole in its balance sheet, though no money was actually exchanged. (One former Genesis employee said that the flimsy nature of DCG\u2019s support\ufeff was not known among rank-and-file employees at Genesis.)\n\nAt Gemini, the steep decline in crypto markets following the Terra-Luna and Three Arrows debacles only appeared to make the twins more remote. In January 2022, the twins had hired a new chief technology officer, Pravjit Tiwana, from Amazon. Seen internally as a likely candidate to one day run the exchange, Tiwana favored the kind of move-fast-and-break-things model that Silicon Valley ran on, dismantling the company\u2019s quality assurance team, and pushing out several of the most experienced people on the risk team, former employees said. Tiwana was widely unpopular among those who\u2019d helped build the company in its early years, particularly for weekly, companywide presentations where, ex-employees said, he and his lieutenants would grill employees on why they hadn\u2019t hit goals that seemed far out of reach. (Tiwana left the company on November 15.) After laying off 10 percent of Gemini\u2019s workforce in June, the twins went on a band tour, where they would play covers of Rage Against the Machine and Blink-182, among others. In one widely circulated clip of their set, they couldn\u2019t quite remember the words to \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d:\n\nuh so i saw the winklevoss twins' band? tonight? like, it's really them pic.twitter.com/xVqYwQrztL \u2014 maggie ;) (@arch_nem) June 10, 2022\n\nMeanwhile, the problems with Earn were growing more obvious inside the company. Requests from Gemini risk officers for standard disclosures \u2014 like who Genesis was loaning money to \u2014 went unanswered, two people said. According to the New York attorney general\u2019s lawsuit, Gemini knew that Genesis wouldn\u2019t have the money to pay back its loans if it went under. Cameron said during a board meeting that Genesis was \u201clying about financials.\u201d A lawsuit that Gemini would later file against the lender claims that Genesis gave them \u201cfalsified balance sheets and other financial reports, which falsely indicated that [Genesis] was solvent when in reality it was not.\u201d\n\nOn October 13, Gemini gave Genesis 30 days notice that it would end the Earn program, court documents show. However, according to the attorney general\u2019s suit, Gemini never stopped promoting Earn on its website and continued to funnel money into the soon-to-be bankrupt lender. Before those 30 days were up, Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto empire collapsed, revealing his extensive criminal fraud and sending crypto markets into freefall. Simultaneously, the true extent of Genesis\u2019s risky lending was exposed. With so many loans concentrated with Alameda, Genesis was insolvent and soon after declared bankruptcy. When it did so, the $900 million in Earn customer funds that it controlled immediately became frozen \u2014 as they remain today. (Since those funds are invested in crypto and those markets are up dramatically in 2023, the overall value of the Gemini customer assets trapped with Genesis is now more than $1.1 billion.)\n\nIn the wake of the collapse, the twins tried to come to a settlement with DCG and its founder and CEO, billionaire and longtime crypto-Twitter troll Barry Silbert. During these negotiations, four people who were either inside one of the companies or were briefed on the discussions directly were told that Silbert and the twins discussed paying back customers some portion of their deposits immediately \u2014 but less than what they\u2019d deposited. The payments would have taken the form of shares of DCG\u2019s Grayscale Bitcoin Trust \u2014 which the twins\u2019 exchange had secured in collateral, according to the suit filed against Genesis by Gemini.\n\nThe talks collapsed in December, and soon after, one of Gemini\u2019s attorneys, Niels Gjertsen, left the company. (Gjertsen declined to comment.) The twins would soon take their fight against Silbert to Twitter, and add to their portfolio of lawsuits when they sued Genesis in Manhattan federal bankruptcy court for more shares of the bitcoin trust. (The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil suit accusing both companies of other financial violations that month.) Silbert\u2019s company has claimed that Gemini\u2019s suit is a \u201cpublicity stunt,\u201d while Gemini is accusing its former lending partner of basically stealing from Earn customers. With the dispute playing out in court, Gemini\u2019s Earn customers are still in limbo. Their assets show up in their accounts, but they are unable to access them. The day before Thanksgiving things got even worse: Genesis filed a suit seeking to claw back $689 million from Gemini customers who were able to get their money out before the collapse, making it less clear when or whether the other customers will ever be able to do so. (It\u2019s also unclear whether, should the customers ever get paid back, it would be in current crypto prices, or the dollar amount of assets at the time of the bankruptcy, which were much lower.)\n\nMultiple former Gemini employees expressed frustration at what they saw as a mishandling by the Winklevoss brothers of a situation that didn\u2019t need to leave the exchanges customers stranded and fearful of losing their assets. Among the victims are a 79-year-old grandmother who, according to the attorney general\u2019s suit, invested her husband\u2019s entire $199,000 savings into the program. She \u201chad hoped to use this money to pay for her grandchild\u2019s education. Outside of her Earn investment, she and her husband have little savings,\u201d according to the suit. Glen, the depositor, declined to say how much he put into Earn but said that he\u2019s had to delay a medical procedure because his money is frozen. \u201cAs for Gemini, I do believe they bear some responsibility, considering they were the ones offering and promoting the Earn program,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems only fair that they should cover at least a portion of the deposits to help mitigate the losses for users like myself.\u201d\n\nThe twins are fighting the New York State charges against their business. Silbert is doing the same. (While Silbert was named as a defendant in the attorney general\u2019s suit, the Winklevosses were not. Representatives from Gemini and Genesis didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.) Regardless of the outcome, the Winklevosses\u2019 big opportunity appears to have passed them by. Coinbase, its largest U.S. competitor, saw 42 times more trading volume than Gemini on one recent November day, according to publicly available data. Its CEO, Brian Armstrong, has already cast himself as the most trustworthy major crypto CEO left. \u201cWe now have an opportunity to start a new chapter for this industry,\u201d he recently said on X. In fact, the new chapter looks a lot like the vision that the twins first pitched before the last bubble burst.\n\nIn the crypto world, investors are preparing for another boom. Bitcoin has more than doubled off its 2022 lows. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is on the verge of offering its own bitcoin and ethereum ETFs \u2014 the very thing the Winklevosses tried to do a decade ago. JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the U.S., plans on issuing its cryptocurrency during the next year or so. Rather than scramble to win back a potential new wave of institutional business, the twins are, at least publicly, lamenting that they ever played by the rules at all. \u201cWe spent years doing things the right way, going in the front door, asking permission not forgiveness,\u201d Cameron \u2014 or is it Tyler? \u2014 said in a June Instagram post. \u201cAnd honestly, at this point, it\u2019s unclear what good it\u2019s done for us.\u201d\n\nThis story was updated to include a comment from Jared Shaw denying meeting with any Genesis employees, and to clarify the timeline of the Genesis bankruptcy proceedings."

        "title": "What Was the Silk Road Online? History and Closure by FBI - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Was Silk Road?\n\nSilk Road was a digital black market platform that was popular for hosting money laundering activities and illegal drug transactions using Bitcoin. Silk Road, regarded as the first darknet market, was launched in 2011 and eventually shut down by the FBI in 2013. It was founded by Ross William Ulbricht, who is now serving a life sentence in prison for his role in Silk Road.\n\nSince that time, several other darknet markets have risen.\n\nKey Takeaways The Silk Road was an online black market where buyers and sellers of illegal or unethical items could transact anonymously.\n\nUtilizing privacy techniques such as the Tor network and cryptocurrency transactions, people were able to transact in drugs, hacked passwords, illegal data, and other contraband.\n\nThe FBI shut down Silk Road in 2013, and its founder, Ross Ulbricht, was sentenced to prison for life.\n\nUnderstanding Silk Road\n\nThe digital era has brought many technological innovations to our home fronts and created lifestyles that were unthinkable at the turn of the century. We can now conduct transactions online with ecommerce sites, pay for online transactions using virtual currency, get loans online using social lending sites, operate anonymously on the web using data anonymization technology, and even connect with company recruiters using social media sites. The list of digital technology inventions goes on and ventures into every sector of the world's economy.\n\nWhat Lead to Its Creation?\n\nAn increase in the use of cyber technology like cryptocurrency and ecommerce marketplaces led to an increase in the demand for data privacy. Demand for privacy increased regulation and laws over how data is used; additionally, an increase in technological tools and platforms was created to serve users who prefer to live more anonymously. While the initiation of data anonymization tools helps protect users' personally identifiable information (PII), these tools are also used by entities who intend to conduct illegal and criminal activities. In 2011, the Silk Road was born out of a need to connect illicit drug sellers with interested buyers online while protecting their identities and transactions using anonymization techniques.\n\nThrough a combination of data anonymization technology, a trading platform, and a feedback system, Silk Road created a haven for drug traders. The site was accessible only through a network known as Tor, which exists mainly to anonymize user data and activities online. Tor obfuscates users' addresses so they appear hidden from unwanted parties looking to surveil the users' transactions and activities\u2014in other words, Silk Road, Tor, and cryptocurrency was the ultimate privacy toolkit for illegal operations.\n\nBitcoin is designed to be anonymous, with only the wallet's public address displayed on the blockchain. If the wallet owner doesn't want to be associated with the address, there isn't any way to identify them if they don't reveal themselves some other way. Addresses with questionable transactions are monitored by authorities for activity, which is how many illegal transactions using cryptocurrency are identified.\n\nPrivacy and Feedback\n\nSome Silk Road buyers and sellers brazenly conducted illegal drug transactions without fear because their IP addresses could not be traced back to them. Another reason Silk Road thrived was the buyer feedback system implemented on the platform. Buyers would normally provide feedback on sellers after receiving their goods. The feedback received was then used by the site to weed out fraudulent sellers, while reputable sellers had their products highly sought after. This promoted buyer confidence in the online platform.\n\nAll trades on Silk Road were conducted using the virtual currency known as Bitcoin. Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on a public ledger, which is easily surveilled by legal and regulatory bodies.\n\nThe Fall of Silk Road\n\nThe Silk Road came to its demise in 2013 after the FBI learned about the existence of the hidden marketplace and colluded with the DEA, IRS, and Customs agents. Although the federal agents admitted that the use of Tor and Bitcoin to obscure addresses were significant obstacles that they encountered, they were still able to crack down on the underground drug market.\n\nThe FBI shut down the site permanently, seized more than 144,000 bitcoins (then valued at $34 million), and arrested several users of the site, including the founder, Ross Ulbricht, who made about $80 million in commissions from transactions carried out within the site. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 and is currently serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n\nDoes the Silk Road Still Exist Today? The Silk Road, as it was before being taken down in 2013, no longer exists. However, the dark web is still operating, and most things found on Silk Road are available via various venues. Authorities continue to crack down on illegal operations.\n\nWhat Happened to the Bitcoins Seized From Silk Road? More than 144,000 were recovered at the time of the takedown. But in 2022, James Zhong pled guilty and was convicted of wire fraud. IRS special agents recovered more than $3 billion in cryptocurrency from his home, stolen from Silk Road in 2012.\n\nDoes Ross Ulbricht Still Have Bitcoin? Ulbricht is still in prison as of 2023 and no longer has any bitcoin unless it is hidden somewhere and agents did not find it.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSilk Road was the name of a platform used on the dark web to sell illegal goods, providing anonymity for those who required it for their activities. Federal agents took the site down, and the founder was arrested in 2013.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "Bitcoin mining consumed 1.6 trillion litres of water worldwide in 2021.\n\nA single Bitcoin transaction could use the same amount of clean water needed to fill a garden swimming pool, according to a new study on the world's most popular cryptocurrency. According to New Scientist, Alex de Vries at the VU Amsterdam School of Business and Economics in the Netherlands calculated that Bitcoin mining, used in part to create new Bitcoins, consumed 1.6 trillion litres of water worldwide in 2021. Broken down per transaction, that means a single Bitcoin trade consumed approximately 16,000 litres of clean water, which is enough to fill a small swimming pool.\n\nNow, experts believe that the use of clean water in Bitcoin mining will rise to 2.3 trillion litres this year. According to the study published in the journal Cell Reports Sustainability, this sheer scale of Bitcoin mining's water consumption could impact drinking water if it continues to operate without regulation, especially in countries that are already battling water scarcity, including the United States. This is \"increasingly hard to defend,\" said Mr Alex.\n\nAccording to the study, mining Bitcoin requires huge computing power to solve mathematical equations on the internet. Water, which is evaporated, is used to cool the computers at large data centres and also to lower the temperature of coal-and-gas-fired power plants that also power Bitcoin mining computers.\n\n\"The mining devices are effectively just generating random numbers all day long, and they just throw them all away and nothing - nothing - useful comes out,\" Mr Alex wrote in the paper. \"It's just one backyard swimming pool going, going up in the air, literally evaporating on average per Bitcoin transaction,\" he added.\n\nAlso Read | Google DeepMind Discovers \"800 Years' Worth Of Knowledge\"\n\nNotably, according to Euronews, the environmental impact of mining Bitcoin has been widely documented, but this is the first assessment of its water use and wider environmental impact. Study authors believe that with the rise in Bitcoin price, its water consumption will also increase to 2,300 gigalitres, which is more than 40% compared to 2021. Mr Alex argued that using renewable energy instead of electricity would not be a solution to reducing Bitcoin's carbon footprint.\n\nHowever, in the study, he also wrote that if Bitcoin changed its technology to be more environmentally friendly, the crypto's environmental damage would reverse overnight. \"If you make the change you cut the majority of everything: the carbon emissions, water footprint, electronic waste, it all goes out the window overnight. Literally, the moment you make the software change, it's all gone,\" Mr Alex said. \"Bitcoin is responsible for half a per cent of global electricity consumption, [and] we could cut this by tomorrow,\" he added."

Mark your calendars people. https://t.co/8ob8Y6pgU5 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 1, 2023\n\nThe crypto industry has been waiting for a spot Bitcoin ETF to be approved for years.\n\nIn the U.S., regulators have approved Bitcoin futures and even leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs to trade. But a genuine Bitcoin ETF, one that directly tracks BTC and not just derivatives, has so far eluded investors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe idea is this: shares in a Bitcoin ETF would gain and lose value as Bitcoin's price fluctuates, and investments in those shares would allow buyers to gain exposure to BTC without actually buying or holding digital coins.\n\nBecause an ETF makes it easier for traditional investors to jump into crypto, analysts have long predicted that such a product would bring a massive influx of capital into the market. Recently, researchers at blockchain data firm CryptoQuant said they expect an ETF to double Bitcoin's market cap, and potentially increase the overall crypto market by $1 trillion. For context, Apple's market cap sits at a cool $2.9 trillion today.\n\nJust the chance that an ETF might be approved has been incredibly bullish for Bitcoin's price. The world's oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has found buoyancy thanks to all the attention from institutions and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which limits Bitcoin's inflation rate and could further drive up demand.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nDigital asset manager Grayscale continues to say it's just a matter of time before a Bitcoin ETF is finally approved.\n\nThat includes the possibility that the digital asset manager will get approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)\u2014currently an open-ended trust available on the OTCQX Market\u2014into a spot Bitcoin ETF. If converted to an ETF, the firm is aiming to have the fund listed on the NYSE Arca exchange.\n\nAnd to that end, the firm asked Craig Salm, its chief legal officer, and Edward McGee, its chief financial officer, to address some common questions about the potential conversion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe believe that regulatory approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is a matter of \u2018when,\u2019 not a matter of \u2018if,'\" Salm wrote in a company blog post today. Once approved, Grayscale \u201cwould immediately work with our partners to uplist GBTC to NYSE Arca,\u201d he added.\n\nBut for every bullish Bitcoin ETF prediction, there's a caveat. Grayscale did not provide an expected timeline for GBTC\u2019s conversion. \u201cTimelines are inherently uncertain,\u201d Salm said.\n\nSome ETF analysts have offered educated guesses about when the SEC might make a decision on pending applications. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said he expects to see some movement from the SEC between Monday, January 8 and Wednesday, January 10.\n\nIn 2022, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC, claiming the Commission had been unfair in refusing to accept an application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. Being an ETF would allow the fund to perform simultaneous creations and redemptions of shares to trade in line with Bitcoin's real-time price.\n\nThere's been signs that Grayscale has been making progress. For starters, a judge decided in August that the SEC does need to accept the firm's application. In October, it became clear the SEC wasn't going to file an appeal to the decision and was then ordered to officially review the ETF bid.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo that end, a memo published by the SEC revealed that the SEC met with Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein and McGee last month to discuss \"NYSE Arca, Inc.\u2019s proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E.\"\n\nEven without being a spot ETF, GBTC already accounts for more than 3% of the total BTC supply. It currently trades at an 8% discount to its net asset value. But as Salm pointed out in the Grayscale blog post, converting to an ETF structure would allow Grayscale to \u201cmore closely track the price of Bitcoin.\"\n\nEdited by Guillermo Jimenez\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset\u2019s price climbs. This has been observed in Bitcoin and Litecoin.\n\nMacroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on interest rates influence risk assets like Bitcoin, mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar.

        "content": "In anticipation of a potential bull market, investors often become engrossed in a narrative, sometimes overlooking the importance of considering alternative scenarios.\n\nThe 90% chance of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval in January, according to Bloomberg analysts, and the halving event have been major points of discussion within the crypto community. However, short-term pullback and a price correction of BTC are also possible scenarios to consider.\n\nBullish case\n\nBTC has \u201cleft behind depression and disbelief to enter the next stage: Hope,\u201d the second stage of the halving cycle according to renowned crypto investor CryptoCon.\n\n\u201cAfter a long period of despair, [BTC] price starts to show some signs of making a turnaround,\u201d he added on X.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s protocol reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half approximately every four years, an event known as \u201chalving.\u201d This reduction in new supply tends to create upward pressure on the price as the rate of new Bitcoin entering the market slows down.\n\nFollowing a halving, the reduced supply often leads to a bull market characterized by rising prices and increased investor interest.\n\nHalving Cycles Theory Sine Waves. Source: CryptoCon\n\nInvestors are currently in the \u2018Hope\u2019 phase of the cycle, according to the analyst. This means that people are starting to believe in Bitcoin again after long despair, and the price of Bitcoin has started to show signs of recovery, and it is now trading at fair value, he highlights. The next phase of the cycle is \u2018Belief\u2019.\n\nThis is when investors will start believing in Bitcoin, and the price will rise rapidly. This phase is expected to begin in June 2024 and last for about two years. The final phase of the cycle is \u2018Red Year\u2019, when the price of Bitcoin will reach its all-time high and then crash. This phase is expected to start in June 2026 and last for about one year, according to the expert.\n\nBearish case\n\nThe halving event has historically triggered a correction in Bitcoin\u2019s price before rallying, highlights a crypto analyst AlanSantana in a TradingView post. As the prices rise, the market can become overextended, leading to a bear market where prices fall and investor sentiment becomes negative.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart by AlanSantana.

He suggested that intense hype often precedes bearish outcomes.\n\n\u201cThey say billions and billions and billions and billions and more will be coming in due to these ETFs, really? Here is the thing, these ETFs, these \u201cconventional trading vehicles\u201d are not going to be selling Bitcoins to their clients; they are going to be selling shares, coupons, digits on a screen or what not. If they need Bitcoins, they are buying it now or bought them long ago to later use as back-up for their customers funds,\u201d wrote AlanSantana\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin is currently trading at $37,727, which is very close to the upper \u2018Bollinger Band\u2019, according to EliteTradingSignals, a prominent crypto trader. This indicates that the pair is overbought and may be due for a pullback.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart by EliteTradingSignals.

However, the short-term overbought condition suggests that a pullback is more likely, wrote the expert.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
