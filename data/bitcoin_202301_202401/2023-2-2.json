        "title": "There\u2019s a wild theory that the price of Bitcoin is being propped up\u2014and the academic who proved manipulation in 2017 suspects it may be happening again - Fortune",
        "content": "Back in 2017, John Griffin, a professor of finance at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, noticed something strange. Griffin follows a totally different beat from typical business school finance profs who explore, say, how business cycles influence commodity prices or Fed policy sways the term structure of interest rates. The 6-foot-2 former high school football star views himself as a crusader for good, a moral sleuth who, as he tells Fortune, \u201clooks to expose financial evil, to shed light on the world and expose dark things in the markets.\u201d After the Great Financial Crisis, Griffin became a devout Christian. He has since dedicated his distinguished career to righteous forensic digging that\u2019s unearthed abuses ranging from insider trading to mortgage fraud to the doctoring of bond ratings during the financial crisis.\n\nAs Griffin and Amin Shams, then a doctoral candidate at McCombs who\u2019s joined Griffin in several gumshoe investigations, screened for misdeeds in 2017, they were fascinated to see that a little-known token that\u2019s supposed to be backed one-for-one to the dollar was getting printed in large quantities. That clue led the pair to another: When new batches appeared, the price of Bitcoin seemed to jump. It looked like someone, or a group, was using that freshly printed \u201cfree money\u201d to inflate Bitcoin\u2019s price for their own profit. He and his coauthor Shams sifted through an incredible 200 gigabytes of trading data, equal to the troves that the Smithsonian Institution collects in two years, and followed sales and purchases from 2.5 million separate wallets.\n\nIn 2018, they coauthored a groundbreaking study showing that a single, still unidentified, Bitcoin \u201cwhale\u201d almost singlehandedly drove the token\u2019s giant run-up in late 2017 and early 2018 by distorting the trading in the token.\n\nToward the end of 2022, another mystifying trend caught Griffin\u2019s eye. Despite the crypto crash and myriad other negative forces, every time Bitcoin briefly breached the $16,000 floor, it bounced above that level and kept stubbornly trading between $16,000 and $17,000. Almost unbelievably, as the crypto market has continued to unravel into 2023, Bitcoin has gone in the opposite direction, trading up 35% since Jan. 7 to $23,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very suspicious,\u201d Griffin told Fortune. \u201cThe same mechanism we saw in 2017 could be at play now in the still unreal Bitcoin market.\u201d\n\nFor Griffin, the way normally super-volatile Bitcoin went calm and stable in the stormiest of times for crypto fits a scenario where boosters are uniting to support and juice its price. \u201cIf you\u2019re a crypto manipulator, you want to set a floor under the price of your coin,\u201d added Griffin. \u201cIn a period of highly negative sentiment, we\u2019ve seen suspiciously solid floors under Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThough manipulation is unproven, the signs are troubling\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that no definitive proof of chicanery has so far emerged. \u201cThe space is bigger now so it\u2019s harder to dig the data,\u201d says Griffin. \u201cSophisticated players may be expert at hiding their identities.\u201d We have seen credible leaks asserting that major market participants call meetings of the sector\u2019s elite when they fear a crypto leader plans to make what they consider a reckless, industry-endangering move. But no evidence has surfaced that the players are gathering to coordinate buying of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. For example it's well known that earlier this fall Changpeng Zhao (known as CZ), chief of Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange and other crypto crypto leaders believed that Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s hedge fund Alameda was attacking Tether, the then-wobbling coin whose reliability is crucial to the industry\u2019s well-being, and reportedly encouraged him to stop. (Tether\u2014symbol USDT\u2014by the way, was also at the center of the 2017-18 manipulation exposed by Griffin and Shams.)\n\nIt's possible that evidence of cozy, clubby practices will come to light in the numerous bankruptcy proceedings, lawsuits, and criminal investigations now pending in the crypto-verse. \u201cNow that SBF is being charged, he\u2019ll turn on the other players and could accuse them of collusion,\u201d predicts Alex de Vries, an economist at the central bank of the Netherlands who runs Digiconomist, a site that tracks Bitcoin\u2019s carbon footprint. The collapse Genesis's lending business has set Barry Silbert, the head of its parent Digital Currency Group, at the throats of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, cofounders of floundering exchange Gemini. The brothers claim that DCG owes the $900 million that Gemini\u2019s depositors loaned to a Genesis program that paid high interest rates and threaten to sue DCG and Silbert, whom they accuse of stonewalling and denying DCG's true liability. Put simply, as onetime allies battle in court, the secrecy surrounding trading in concert, if it exists, could well crumble.\n\nGriffin is far from the only prominent observer who\u2019s wary of bad behavior. In a blog post on Nov. 30 titled \u201cBitcoin\u2019s Last Stand,\u201d European Central Bank Director General for market operations Ulrich Bindseil and ECB adviser J\u00fcrgen Schaaf dismissed Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence as \u201can artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance.\u201d Two leading figures on Wall Street told this writer on background that Bitcoin\u2019s price action, by resisting a flood of bad news, looks phony and different from a normal free market ruled by independent buyers and sellers.\n\nBitcoin has showed amazing stability amid negative sentiment\n\nThe leading sign that Bitcoin\u2019s benefiting from coordinated buying: its astoundingly steady performance, forming the base for a takeoff to five-month highs following the FTX debacle that seemed likely to send the mainstay token reeling. From Nov. 5, the day before the FTX reports started spreading, to Nov. 9, Bitcoin (based on closing prices) dropped from $21,300 to $15,900, its lowest reading since late 2020, for a fall of 25%. Then the normally careening coin went, by Bitcoin standards, flat. In the 62 days between Nov. 10 and Jan. 11, it traded in the $16,000s and $17,000s for all but one day. In the 50 days from Nov. 22 to Jan. 11, its closing prices hovered in a narrow band, from a low of $16,200 and a high of $17,900, a difference from bottom to top of 10%.\n\nThis initial period of supersmooth sailing was atypical, to put it mildly. Fortune data editor Scott DeCarlo ran a detailed analysis and found that since the start of 2017, Bitcoin has never fluctuated in any of the 40 consecutive 50-day spans by less than 19%, and varied by over 30% in three out of four seven-week time frames. The median low to high reading was 44%. Hence, Bitcoin at peak FTX-induced turmoil showed both its smallest swings ever by a wide margin, and divergence from low to high that was one-fourth to one-fifth its average over the past six years.\n\nThen, from Jan. 12 to 24, Bitcoin began a bizarre upward march. During those two weeks, it rebounded by 28% from $17,935 to $23,000, its best price since August and well above the number when FTX fears began raging. This occurred while the market was digesting the bankruptcies of lender BlockFi on Nov. 28; Core Scientific, one of the largest publicly traded miners, on Dec. 21; and the Genesis lending arm a month later.\n\nYou\u2019d think that the turmoil surrounding Bitcoin would have shaken the confidence of small investors and institutions alike in crypto, leading to lots of selling pressure and sharply falling prices. Indeed, sentiment on social media turned heavily against Bitcoin following the FTX catastrophe. Reflecting the sinking enthusiasm was a steep retreat in trading activity. At Coinbase, volumes in Q4 were well below Q3 readings, and down 52% from Q1.\n\nCould there be alternate explanations for Bitcoin's robust performance? A number of experts who follow crypto trading from day to day see no plot to inflate the prices, but a well-functioning market. \u201cI don\u2019t see a cabal of insiders,\u201d says Andrew Thurman, a researcher at Blockchain analytics provider Nansen. \u201cThe price movements in Bitcoin are notoriously cyclical by nature. Often the best explanation is the most boring one. In this case, the price of Bitcoin is rising because there are more buyers than sellers. If anything, fallen players such as Celsius and FTX were selling Bitcoin and pushing down prices to prop up their own coins.\u201d Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at Norwegian crypto data analysis firm Arcane Research, agrees. \u201cI don\u2019t see a group holding up prices. Now we have a balanced dynamic. The forced selling following the FTX collapse has to some extent been absorbed and we\u2019re seeing no further forced selling,\u201d a phenomenon that\u2019s aided Bitcoin\u2019s recent rebound to over $23,000.\n\nBut there's no question that Bitcoin's post-FTX sturdiness, capped by its new jump, is a gigantic gift to the enterprises whose fortunes wax and wane with Bitcoin\u2019s price. The stocks for exchanges, miners, and lenders all took a big leg down in the days after meltdown. But since hitting two-year lows in December, miners Riot, Marathon, and Bitfarms have jumped 92%, 150%, and 189% respectively as of Jan. 27. Coinbase, one of the world\u2019s largest exchanges, has advanced 85% from its pre\u2013New Year\u2019s trough, adding $7 billion in market cap. Riot, Bitfarms have all rebounded to near their plateaus just prior to the FTX disaster.\n\nOne of the players most desperate for a boost got a big one. At MicroStrategy, cofounder and executive chairman Michael Saylor loaded his hybrid software provider and Bitcoin speculator with $2.4 billion in debt to buy coins, and when prices fell below $16,000 on Nov. 11, owed far more on his loans than the value of his cache of tokens. If Bitcoin kept dropping, MicroStrategy was heading for big trouble. But Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence has lifted MicroStrategy\u2019s holdings out of the red and sent its stock price from $166 in mid-November to $258 on Jan. 27, a gain of 55%.\n\nCrypto operates on a narrower edge than virtually any other financial sector. The factor that determines whether the big crypto players mint profits or tumble into bankruptcy is the price of Bitcoin, the benchmark that in turn leads the prices for other coins. Much of the crypto world has already shattered. But a lot more stalwarts were due to go down unless Bitcoin found a decent foundation after the FTX downfall shook that slender edge.\n\nGriffin and Shams\u2019 findings from the 2017\u201318 rigging are echoing today\n\nThe Griffin-Shams study of the forces behind the 2017\u201318 Bitcoin bubble provides a guide to the strategies that could be pressing a thumb on the sales post-FTX. Griffin and Shams, now a professor at Ohio State\u2019s Fisher College of Business, first published their 118-page report in 2018, and it appeared two years later in the prestigious, peer-reviewed Journal of Finance.\n\nFor the team, a tipoff for possible manipulation was that Bitfinex, the large exchange closely related to Tether, wasn\u2019t providing much transparency about the supposed stablecoin. \u201cWe saw blogs speculating that Bitfinex wasn\u2019t providing full backing for the coin,\u201d recalls Griffin. \u201cIf someone\u2019s printing money by printing Tether that\u2019s unbacked by fiat currency, it could cause a bubble in Bitcoin,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the hypothesis.\u201d\n\nGriffin and Shams found that two practices converged to spur those huge, sudden gains. The first: a flood of newly created coins that gave the fraudster the currency to goose Bitcoin. The second is the approach that\u2019s most relevant today, in which the manipulator or manipulators agree that every time the price drops to a target level, they\u2019ll jump in to push it well above that benchmark.\n\nThe pair saw a strong and questionable pattern in Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin had its biggest spikes when two things happened: Prices started dropping, and lot of Tether was being printed. Then, as now, Tether was the most important \u201cstablecoin,\u201d or cryptocurrency supposedly supported one-to-one by reserves in fiat currency. Tether\u2019s effectively a stand-in for the dollar; each coin is supposed to be backed by the equivalent of one greenback in fiat currency. Tether is issued by an arm of iFinex, a Hong Kong company that also owns what was then the world\u2019s largest exchange, Bitfinex.\n\nThe authors focused on the 1% of all one-hour intervals between the beginning of March 2017 and end of March 2018 that featured the largest combinations of large Tether issuance on Bitfinex, and big Bitcoin buys on two other exchanges, Bittrex and Poloniex. Just before the start of each period, Bitcoin prices were under pressure. But in each case, it appeared that a single huge buyer rode to the rescue, pushing the token sharply higher by the end of the 60-minute interlude. The \u201cwhale,\u201d whose identity remains a mystery, was using Tether to buy Bitcoin and hike its price. \u201cWe saw a regular pattern of very sizable price reversals,\u201d recalls Shams.\n\nThe 95 one-hour spans that witnessed those big Tether and Bitcoin inflows accounted for nearly 60% of Bitcoin\u2019s immense gains over those 13 months.\n\n\u201cTether is used as cash to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,\u201d notes Shams. Although the market cap of Tether is a fraction of Bitcoin\u2019s, Tether\u2019s trading volumes are higher. Given its importance in trading, the printing of Tether without backing creates \u201cnew money\u201d the way the Fed does when it prints excess quantities of dollars. \u201cThe issuing of Tether without backing inflated the amount of currency chasing the same supply of Bitcoin,\u201d Griffin told Fortune. \u201cThe Tether created from thin air was inflating the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nOnce the whale obtained the newly minted Tether, it traded the coins for big quantities of Bitcoin on Bittrex and Poloniex. Those large buys reversed the downward trend in Bitcoin and boosted its price well above its level before the dip began. \u201cThis player either showed clairvoyant market timing or exerted an extremely large effect on Bitcoin\u2019s price,\u201d states the study. Today, it\u2019s clear that Tether wasn\u2019t holding full reserves behind the coins in this Bitcoin boom period, so that \u201cit\u2019s almost mechanical that money from nowhere would boost the price,\u201d notes Griffin.\n\nAfter the paper appeared, Tether Ltd. insisted that its conclusions were flawed and maintained that Tether couldn\u2019t be used to balloon Bitcoin prices. But a Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation found otherwise. In October 2021, the CFTC won a $41 million settlement from Tether and its owners for failing to back its coins with dollars as advertised. The CFTC found that \u201cTether held sufficient reserves to back\u2026tokens in circulation only 27.6% of the time in the 26-month sample from 2016 through 2018\u201d and \u201ccomingled reserve funds with Bitfinex\u2019s operational and customer funds.\u201d Says Griffin, \u201cBitcoin and Tether aren\u2019t used for buying things like cars and pizzas, they\u2019re used for buying other coins. So in that closed system, a relatively small amount of manipulated buying, spurred by creating new coins from nothing, can cause an outsize increase in the Bitcoin price.\u201d\n\nThe whale mastered setting a floor and kept the floor rising\n\nThe authors also found that the sizable purchases frequently happened when Bitcoin\u2019s price reached certain thresholds, just below multiples of $500. \u201cWe saw far more purchases at those benchmarks,\u201d says Griffin. \u201cThe whale kept establishing price floors, and those floors kept rising. It wasn\u2019t a club. It was one entity. But when the whale held the price at the thresholds, that made it look as if Bitcoin was safe at those floors. That made it look safe for funds and small customers to buy Bitcoin, driving the price still higher.\u201d Adds Shams, \u201cAround round number price levels of Bitcoin, we saw activities consistent with creating price supports.\u201d\n\nGriffin suspects that a similar dynamic is operating today. He says that collusion to prop up Bitcoin would mean that a clique of buyers agrees to purchase together when the price nears a floor. Let\u2019s say that trigger is $16,000, a figure Bitcoin almost always remained just above during its time of extreme stability. If Bitcoin experiences heavy sales threatening to drive its price below $16,000, in our example, the whale club enters en masse. \u201cThat $16,000, for example, could serve as a coordinating mechanism,\u201d says Griffin. The manipulators could drive the price up to near $17,000, then sell part of their winnings in many small trades that don\u2019t move the market. They could pocket big profits just letting the price bounce back and forth in the tunnel between $16,000 and $17,000.\n\nGrowing confidence that Bitcoin won\u2019t breach $16,000 would encourage more speculators to join in the buying. Then the group can agree to set a new floor at $18,000. \u201cIn crypto, a group of manipulators can push Bitcoin to higher floors unless a big party moves against them,\u201d says Griffin. But it\u2019s much harder to short Bitcoin than to short stocks or bonds. We aren\u2019t seeing evidence of another group moving to drive down the price, giving a stronger hand to any possible club of bulls. \u201cMost of the players in the space have a strong incentive to maintain a price floor,\u201d says Griffin.\n\nIn conclusion, Griffin says, the Griffin-Shams study showed concrete proof of manipulation in 2017 and 2018, and that a single individual did the rigging. \u201cWe don\u2019t have concrete analysis this time,\u201d he says. \u201cThe truth may emerge in specific stories, if there is collusion.\u201d The lesson, he says, \u201cis that the Bitcoin market remains highly vulnerable to manipulation.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin in the wake of the FTX debacle has registered a wondrous performance. Maybe too wondrous to be trusted."

        "content": "It happened. Bitcoin runs DOOM.\n\nTo the delight of crypto Twitter and Reddit circles, someone has uploaded a cloned version of the 30-year-old video game classic DOOM to the Bitcoin blockchain as an inscription on the network\u2019s own NFT protocol, Ordinals.\n\nThanks to a happenstance loophole enabled by Bitcoin\u2019s Taproot upgrade pushed in Nov. 2021, a budget (read: free) version of DOOM has been permanently etched on a single satoshi via block 774526, which was added to the blockchain on Wednesday morning.\n\nBeing written to Bitcoin means the functional game will forever live on the immutable blockchain. As long as the network is online, folks can play this version of DOOM.\n\nWeb browsers are still required to compile the code, but forcing unconventional technologies to run DOOM is a meme in tech culture. Crafty hackers have made DOOM run via pregnancy tests, calculators, ATMs, smart watches, toasters and Pelotons \u2014 even \u201cunhackable\u201d crypto wallets, among other zany conduits.\n\nWhile the clone is fun in its own blocky-and-basic way, an actual copy of the real DOOM looks destined to make it to the Bitcoin blockchain sometime soon (a Reddit thread from Feb. 2018 suggests DOOM was once playable on Ethereum, however the linked YouTube video is now unavailable).\n\nDOOM on Bitcoin via a single satoshi\n\nMeanwhile, Ordinals continues to pepper conversation amongst Bitcoiners as the community parses what bringing NFTs to the oldest blockchain really means for the future of network and the NFT ecosystem writ large.\n\nThe protocol notably just enabled the biggest-ever Bitcoin block to be mined. A high-definition \u201cTaproot wizard\u201d was inscribed to a satoshi this week, clocking a 3.96MB transaction \u2014 close to Bitcoin\u2019s 4MB block size limit (originally 1MB but stretchable via SegWit).\n\nAs for the DOOM Ordinal, it was only 31.2 KB big.\n\nRemember: It\u2019s not the size that matters.

        "title": "Of Bitcoin and Barbarians | Opinion - Harvard Crimson",
        "content": "You couldn\u2019t miss it if you tried. From YouTube adverts starring celebrity comedians to incessant news stories touting another broken price record, \u201cit\u201d was cryptocurrency, a movement taking the world by storm in 2021 and 2022. Largely born out of libertarian currents in the wake of the last financial crisis and limited in scope to Internet subcommunities for years, crypto had finally entered into the mainstream.\n\nHarvard was not immune from this explosion of enthusiasm. On campus, the first-ever undergraduate organization focused on blockchain was founded, while internships and offers of employment at cryptocurrency firms became ubiquitous and irresistible.\n\nThough the highs of 2021 have mostly subsided and the allure of a blockchain future has been greatly diminished by scandals such as the spectacular collapses of the LUNA \u201cstablecoin\u201d network and the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, it still remains unclear why crypto, a technology more than a decade old, was only able to have its moment in the sun over the past couple of years.\n\nThe classic answer given by pundits has been \u201ceasy money,\u201d the notion that rock-bottom interest rates set by the Federal Reserve had made it far too tempting for deep-pocketed investors to go all in on moonshot ideas like upending the global monetary system. There may certainly be some truth to that, but it can\u2019t explain how crypto captured the popular imagination, not to mention sovereign governments \u2014 how it was able to persuade a solid fifth of Americans and millions of others around the world, spanning across class and cultural boundaries, to risk their financial well-being for the sake of something new.\n\nThis question was somewhere in the back of my mind as I was strolling through the Harvard Art Museums toward the end of the fall semester. Having long been a nerdy numismatist, I soon found myself (again) on the third floor, gawking at the Roman coin collection, which boasts selections from the Late Republican era (1st century BCE) to the Late Antique (3rd-5th centuries BCE).\n\nThe temporal diversity of the collection makes it easy to spot clear compositional differences between coins cast at the opposite ends of the Pax Romana. And while it might not be fair to assume so at first glance, the quality of the coins differ significantly too. By and large, Roman coins, being minted by a central imperial authority, consistently underwent a process of debasement as a smaller and smaller amount of precious metals were used in their manufacture. For instance, whereas the silver denarius was 94 percent pure during the reign of Nero (54 \u2013 68 CE), coins minted by Claudius Victorinus when he ascended to the throne two centuries later in 268 CE were basically junk metal, containing only 0.02 percent of real silver. To many emperors, the logic was simple. Expensive wars required costly expenditures, and what was easier \u2014 raising (and collecting) taxes or simply keeping more bullion in the public coffers by reducing how much was spent on currency?\n\nWhile the thesis that this regular debasement over centuries contributed to the ultimate downfall of the Roman state is hotly debated, the notion that the practice was common knowledge among the populus Romanus is more widely acknowledged. Salaries provided to regular soldiers steadily increased as coin purity decreased, while auxiliary forces recruited from \u201cbarbarian\u201d forces increasingly demanded their pay in pure gold form. The once-unquestioned authority of the Roman state to control the mediums of exchange in its sphere of influence was gradually shredded to tatters.\n\nAmong the many parallels that politicians and thinkers so often draw between the Roman world and ours, especially with respect to the dominating nature of American cultural influence, perhaps one that should be heeded with caution is the loss of public trust in the Roman \u201cfinancial\u201d system and the one that we live with today. While there are certainly very significant differences in their respective architectures \u2014 namely that we no longer seek to chain our monetary supply with the availability of precious specie \u2014 surely we can compare the qualities of public sentiment.\n\nAfter all, money still largely serves the same social functions in our world as it did in our forefathers\u2019, and as with any medium of exchange, unanimous agreement about the value of money is absolutely essential to its continued survival. Once collective trust in its worth erodes beyond some critical point, individuals may be incentivized to seek alternatives. While the Romans may have found refuge in the visible constancy of aurum, as many \u201cgold bugs\u201d still do today, crypto seems to be the new, very popular, kid on the block.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, it doesn\u2019t seem coincidental that a mass media motif that was just as pervasive recently as the rise of cryptocurrency was the imminent threat of inflationary pressures in the United States and globally. Think-tankers lined up to provide their version of how rising prices came to be, with some pointing back to the \u201ceasy money\u201d policies of central banks and others blaming everything from the pandemic to the war in Ukraine. What was much less disputed was the effects of inflation on the average psyche, as popular discontent shot upward, fueled by the widely held belief that central authorities were to blame somehow for the newfound crisis.\n\nFramed in these terms, it may be much less of a mystery why cryptocurrency has appealed to so many so recently. It has been, in essence, a passive revolt against establishment institutions, driven by the same kind of sentiment and notions of a \u201cbreak from the big banks\u201d that drove thousands to Occupy Wall Street more than a decade ago.\n\nYes, crypto\u2019s fifteen minutes of fame has likely elapsed, but extensive mistrust of the present financial status quo lingers. Public policy must thus be willing to address these eddies of economic disaffection, lest our currency too goes the way of the Romans\u2019.\n\nAlexander Junxiang Chen \u201924 is a Neuroscience and Chemistry concentrator in Quincy House.

        "title": "The rise of bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market - Open Access Government",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market, a digital or virtual currency marketplace that uses cryptography for security, has been on the rise in recent years \u2013 here\u2019s why\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is decentralized, meaning no one organization or governmental body has jurisdiction over it. Instead, it operates on a blockchain, a public ledger that records all transactions. 2009 saw the creation of the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, by an unidentified person or group going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nSince then, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been created, with varying levels of success.\n\nThe rise of bitcoin\n\nBitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, has seen a significant increase in value and mainstream acceptance in recent years. In 2009, the value of one Bitcoin was less than a penny. But by December 2017, the value had risen to nearly $20,000. This increase in value has attracted the attention of both individual investors and institutional investors.\n\nMany have begun to see cryptocurrency as a legitimate form of investment, rather than just a speculative gamble. This mainstream acceptance has also led to the development of various financial products, such as futures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), that allow investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market without actually owning any coins.\n\nThe impact of cryptocurrency on the financial industry\n\nThe rise of the cryptocurrency market has also had a significant impact on the financial industry. It has challenged traditional financial institutions, such as banks and payment processors, by providing a decentralized and secure alternative to traditional financial services. For example, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be used to make peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a middleman, such as a bank.\n\nThis has the potential to disrupt the traditional banking system and the way we conduct financial transactions. A Bitcoin wallet is a software program that allows individuals to store, send, and receive Bitcoin. It also manages a person\u2019s private key, which is used to access and conduct transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nWhen an individual wants to make a transaction, they use their wallet to send the desired amount of Bitcoin from their address to the recipient\u2019s address.\n\nThe transaction is then broadcast to the network and confirmed by miners, who add it to the blockchain. Once added to the blockchain, the transaction is considered complete and the funds are transferred to the recipient\u2019s wallet. Bitcoin wallets provide a convenient and secure way to manage one\u2019s Bitcoin transactions. In addition, blockchain technology, which is the underlying technology of cryptocurrency, has the potential to revolutionize many industries beyond just finance. It can be used for everything from supply chain management to voting systems.\n\nThe role of cryptocurrency in e-commerce\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has the potential to revolutionize e-commerce by providing a secure and decentralized way for businesses to accept payments. Online retailers can use cryptocurrency to avoid the high fees and chargebacks associated with traditional payment methods. Additionally, the use of blockchain technology can make e-commerce transactions more secure and transparent.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has the potential to revolutionize e-commerce\n\nOne of the most popular use cases of cryptocurrency in e-commerce is the use of stablecoins. These are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of a fiat currency, such as the US dollar, to avoid the volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies. This makes them a more viable option for e-commerce transactions.\n\nThe use of cryptocurrency in the gaming industry\n\nCryptocurrency has also been gaining popularity in the gaming industry. Players can use the cryptocurrency market to purchase in-game items and virtual currencies, and game developers can use blockchain technology to create decentralized and transparent gaming platforms. One example of this is the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the gaming industry. NFTs are unique digital assets that can be bought, sold, and traded like physical assets. They can be used to represent in-game items, such as weapons or armor, and can even be used to represent virtual real estate.\n\nThe role of cryptocurrency in social media\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrency has also had an impact on social media. Platforms such as Steemit and Minds allow users to earn cryptocurrency by creating and curating content. This incentivizes users to create high-quality content and rewards them for their efforts. In addition, some social media platforms are now accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment for advertising and other services. This allows businesses to reach a wider audience and provides a new revenue stream for the social media platforms.\n\nChallenges faced by cryptocurrency\n\nDespite the rise of cryptocurrency, it is still a relatively new and untested technology. There are several challenges that need to be addressed in order for it to reach its full potential. The absence of regulations is one of the major problems. Because cryptocurrency operates outside of traditional financial systems, it is not subject to the same level of oversight and regulation. Concerns around fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities have arisen as a result of this.\n\nWhile the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has risen, they are still not widely accepted as a form of payment\n\nAnother challenge is the lack of mainstream acceptance. While the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has risen, they are still not widely accepted as a form of payment. This makes it difficult for people to use them in their daily lives. Finally, there is the issue of scalability. The blockchain technology that underlies cryptocurrency can only process a limited number of transactions per second. This may result in lengthy transaction delays and expensive costs.\n\nSince the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, cryptocurrency has advanced significantly\n\nIt has seen a significant increase in value and mainstream acceptance, and has the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. However, there are still challenges that need to be addressed in order for it to reach its full potential. The development of cryptocurrency is an ongoing process, and it will be interesting to see how it evolves in the coming years."

        "content": "Bitcoin briefly touched the $24,000 level on Thursday, reaching a key technical level and building on its January rally.\n\nThe up move came a day after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noted that a disinflationary process has started, soothing investors who are betting on inflation to fall and causing them to take on more risk.\n\nBitcoin was last trading about 1% higher at $23,821.00, according to Coin Metrics. The cryptocurrency rose to $24,069.00 earlier in the afternoon, after rising as high as $24,249.70 Wednesday night, its highest level since Aug. 17.\n\n\"The market took the latest FOMC as dovish, but bitcoin's rally remains precarious,\" said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank. \"The price did rise on Wednesday, but failed to close above $24k and its momentum seems to be on the decline.\""

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies had a very dramatic year in 2022. After a period of explosive growth for many coins, higher interest rates combined with a few spectacular collapses made the industry lose $2 trillion in value.\n\n\n\nParts of the crypto industry have begun to bounce back recently. Bitcoin, for example, has surged 40% in value since the start of 2023. Last weekend, it crossed the $23,000 threshold and continues to remain robust. Mark Cuban of Shark Tank fame defended Bitcoin last month as an instrument of stored value despite soured sentiment. And longtime crypto evangelist Cathie Wood has even gone so far as to say that she thinks Bitcoin will surpass $1.5 million by the end of the decade.\n\nBut not everyone is sold on Bitcoin. Founder of Bridgewater Associates and legendary investor Ray Dalio sees Bitcoin as \u201ca tiny thing\u201d that is unstable and often receives \u201cdisproportionate attention.\u201d The investor compared the value of Bitcoin to Microsoft\u2014the cryptocurrency is less than a third of what the tech giant is valued at\u2014and added that the coin has \u201cno relation to anything.\u201d\n\nBut he acknowledges that in a changing world, consumers want to find ways to store their wealth and secure their buying power.\n\n\u201cWe are in a world where money as we know it is in jeopardy,\u201d Dalio said in an interview Thursday with CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box. \u201cWe are printing too much, and it\u2019s not just the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are going to say, \u2018Where is my safe store of wealth?\u2019\u201d he noted. \u201cI think the question over the next number of years is really \u2018What is money?\u2019 Not just a medium of exchange but a storehold of wealth.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlthough Dalio doesn\u2019t think of Bitcoin as a stable store of value, and he shot down the idea of stablecoins, he didn\u2019t write off digital currencies altogether, and discussed a possible future that could include inflation-linked digital coins.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see probably the development of coins that you haven\u2019t seen that probably will end up being attractive, viable coins. I don\u2019t think Bitcoin is it,\u201d he said.\n\nDalio isn\u2019t the only major investor deeply skeptical of Bitcoin. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a \u201chyped-up fraud\u201d in January while defending the broader technology that powers it as useful. Former options trader and author of The Black Swan, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, has referred to Bitcoin as a \u201ctumor\u201d in the economy that has grown in an uncontrolled manner."

        "content": "The biggest Bitcoin block ever has just been mined, 14 years after the blockchain went live.\n\nIt contained an Ordinal, the controversial new genre of NFT which recently debuted on Bitcoin.\n\nIn an apparent tease for a forthcoming bitcoin NFT collection, Luxor Mining and popular Bitcoin figure Udi Wertheimer mined the largest-ever bitcoin block, the company announced Tuesday.\n\nBlock 774628 housed the \u201cTaproot Wizard,\u201d a play on the legendary \u201cmagic internet money\u201d meme featuring a bitcoin wizard. It was 3.96MB large, close to Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit (which can be stretched to 4MB with SegWit).\n\nThe transaction containing the Ordinal made up 3.94MB, about 99.5%. There were 63 transactions in total, including the 6.25 BTC ($149,000) coinbase reward, which also went to Luxor.\n\n\u201cThe image is higher resolution so it contains more pixels (and thus more bytes),\u201d Colin Harper, head of research and content at Luxor Mining, told Blockworks.\n\nLuxor announced the block via Twitter Tuesday evening, teasing followers that other wizards may be available soon. The firm earned an additional 0.009 BTC ($209) in fees for successfully mining the block.\n\nOrdinals \u2014 the new platform taking the industry by storm \u2014 store texts, images, SCG or HTML on-chain, attached to individual satoshis, bitcoin\u2019s smallest unit currently worth $0.000231.\n\nRead More: Bitcoin NFTs: Love \u2018Em or Hate \u2018Em, You Can\u2019t Ignore \u2018Em\n\nSimilar to the NFT concept, inscribed satoshis can then be transferred freely via the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nLoading Tweet.. This image is inscribed forever to satoshi 1308063627208201\n\nThe features are made possible using a loophole from the Taproot upgrade in 2021, which enabled \u201cpractically unlimited (capped by block size) storage using Opcodes, an executable script in a txn that can store arbitrary data,\u201d Blockworks Research analyst Matt Fiebach said.\n\nOrdinals creator Casey Rodarmor boasts the NFT protocol holds digital artifacts to a \u201chigher standard,\u201d he wrote in a blog post.

        "content": "Cathie Wood is finally admitting she got some things wrong about Bitcoin.\n\nThe founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management said Thursday that she and her team misjudged the uptake of the cryptocurrency\u2014or at least the timing of it\u2014by companies and governments. Her firm has invested heavily in Bitcoin and continues to bet on its eventual rise to meteoric heights.\n\n\u201cWe tempered a few assumptions,\u201d she told Bloomberg Radio on Thursday. \u201cWe thought that\u2014led by Tesla, Block (formerly Square), and MicroStrategy\u2014more corporations would put Bitcoin on their balance sheets. We\u2019ve dialed that one down considerably. And the same thing with nation-states.\u201d\n\nBitcoin lost nearly 65% of its value over 2022, ending the year at about $16,500. It currently stands at just over $23,500.\n\nCompanies holding Bitcoin, not surprisingly, took a beating last year. Tesla for example said in a regulatory filing this week that it registered a $204 million impairment loss on its Bitcoin holdings in 2022. As the cryptocurrency plunged, it sold 75% of its holdings last year.\n\nMeanwhile few governments were eager to follow the lead of El Salvador, which in 2021 became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. A Bloomberg article in November last year carried the headline, \u201cEl Salvador\u2019s $300 Million Bitcoin \u2018Revolution\u2019 Is Failing Miserably.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther countries will probably not move as quickly as they might have if El Salvador had had a grand swoosh right off the bat,\u201d said Wood. \u201cWe do think it will happen, it\u2019s just we\u2019ve pushed it out a bit.\u201d\n\nAs for why it will happen, she noted the inflation and fiscal crises people have suffered due to governments\u2019 monetary responses to the pandemic. \u201cWell, where do these people go for an insurance policy against an implosion in their purchasing power and wealth? It is in something like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is an insurance policy,\u201d she said.\n\nBitcoin \u2018could pass $1 million\u2019\n\nWood acknowledged that 2022 was a \u201cterrible year for everything crypto.\u201d But she said it was \u201cthe centralized, opaque players\u201d like crypto exchange FTX that went bankrupt. Bitcoin, by contrast, \u201cis a rules-based digital monetary system, and it\u2019s global, and there\u2019s no human intervention,\u201d she added.\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried didn\u2019t like Bitcoin because \u201cit\u2019s transparent and decentralized. He couldn\u2019t control it,\u201d Wood said in December.\n\nWood is sticking to her prediction that Bitcoin will see a rapid rise in value in the coming years. In five years, she said, it will hit \u201croughly $670,000, something like that, and then by 2030, as we see more use cases and more of these insurance policies taken out against fiscal and policy regimes that are not healthy, we think it could pass $1 million.\u201d\n\nPlenty of doubters have questioned her prediction. As Bloomberg host Carol Massar noted to Wood, \u201cPeople are saying to me, \u2018Really? Does she really stick to this?\u2019\u201d\n\nMark Mobius, the billionaire cofounder of Mobius Capital Partners, predicted in December that Bitcoin would fall to $10,000 at some point this year.\n\nAnd this week, Warren Buffett\u2019s right-hand man Charlie Munger argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that a \u201ccryptocurrency is not a currency, not a commodity, and not a security. Instead, it\u2019s a gambling contract with a nearly 100% edge for the house.\u201d\n\nMunger, who once called Bitcoin \u201crat poison,\u201d said the U.S. should follow China\u2019s lead and pass laws that prevent both crypto trading and the formation of new cryptocurrencies."

The photos resulted in child pornography charges against Mr. Musbach, so he decided \u201cto have the victim killed so that the victim could not testify against him in the pending criminal case,\u201d the Justice Department said in a news release.\n\nThat case concluded on Oct. 11, 2017, when Mr. Musbach pleaded guilty to endangering the welfare of a child by sexual contact, according to the Justice Department. He was sentenced on Feb. 9, 2018, to a two-year suspended sentence with parole supervision for life."

But John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, thinks there's something suspicious going on, according to Fortune.\n\nHe had a similar inkling of foul play in 2017, when he and a colleague noticed that a single bitcoin \"whale\" seemed to drive the token's price and distort trading.\n\nIn 2018, Griffin and Amin Shams published a 118-page report that detailed their proof of bitcoin market manipulation by a single entity. Two years later, the report was picked up by the peer-reviewed Journal of Finance.\n\nToday, he sees parallels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's very suspicious,\" Griffin told Fortune. \"The same mechanism we saw in 2017 could be at play now in the still unreal bitcoin market.\"\n\nHe explained that a token manipulator would want to set a floor price for their asset, which seems to be the case now for bitcoin, which typically sees high volatility rather than stability.\n\n\"In a period of highly negative sentiment, we've seen suspiciously solid floors under bitcoin,\" he said.\n\nGriffin maintained that the sheer size of the crypto market and the amount of data has made definitive proof elusive. Not only that, but he said bad actors are sophisticated enough to hide their identities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, one finding from Griffin's research five years ago was that sizable bitcoin purchases happened when the token reached certain thresholds.\n\n\"We saw far more purchases at those benchmarks,\" Griffin said. \"The whale kept establishing price floors, and those floors kept rising. It wasn't a club. It was one entity. But when the whale held the price at the thresholds, that made it look as if bitcoin was safe at those floors. That made it look safe for funds and small customers to buy bitcoin, driving the price still higher.\"\n\nBitcoin price floor manipulation\n\nDuring bitcoin's latest run, it's peculiar how reliably bitcoin bounced above $16,000 seemingly the moment it breached that level, he said. That dynamic was evident when Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX was crashing.\n\nIn a five-day stretch in November, bitcoin plunged 25% to $15,900. Then, according to Fortune calculations, the token traded between $16,000 to $18,000 every single day leading up to January 11 except for one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor bitcoin to exhibit that degree of stability is unusual. FTX marked one of the largest collapses in crypto and financial history, yet the price of the world's largest token saw some of the smallest swings ever.\n\nToday, Griffin believes that bitcoin remains \"highly vulnerable to manipulation,\" per Fortune.\n\n\"We don't have concrete analysis this time,\" he added. \"The truth may emerge in specific stories, if there is collusion.\""

        "title": "'Bitcoin NFTs' Aren't New, But Blockchain Purists Are Now on the Defensive - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "For nearly a decade, creators have enlisted sidechain or layer-2 solutions to link digital art to the Bitcoin blockchain. But how this is accomplished\u2014or whether it should even be done\u2014has Crypto Twitter up in arms after new project Ordinals developed a way to add digital items to on-chain Bitcoin transactions.\n\nNFT are blockchain tokens that can serve as a proof of ownership for assets, including digital goods like artwork, videos, music files, and memberships. While blockchains like Ethereum and Solana are synonymous with NFTs and digital collectibles, many Bitcoin developers have sought ways to bring them to the quintessential blockchain.\n\nOne issue hampering the development of NFTs on Bitcoin is the need for smart contracts. In the minting process, NFTs use smart contracts to assign ownership of the digital asset in the NFT. The smart contract updates the ownership when the NFT is bought or sold.\n\nBitcoin has only limited smart contract support.\n\nTo address this, earlier projects like Counterparty and Stacks developed alternative solutions that use a native token for the contract piece but ultimately settle their transactions back on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nStacks Blows Up 57% After Bitcoin NFTs Take Off\n\nEarlier examples\n\nIn 2014, Counterparty launched the first layer-2 solution for digital assets using the Bitcoin blockchain. Counterparty, which provides the infrastructure for users to create unique tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, saw its XCP token hit an all-time high above $91 in 2018, but it has fallen about 97% since.\n\nAlthough surpassed by Ethereum and other popular NFT chains in recent years, Counterparty still has an active community of supporters\u2014and its assets can be bridged to Ethereum. More importantly, Counterparty is best known as the home for historical assets like Rare Pepes, which still command significant sums on secondary markets. In April 2022, an NFT containing the opening theme to Larry David\u2019s \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d was minted using Counterparty.\n\nStory continues\n\nLaunched in 2017 as Blockstacks, Stacks (as it\u2019s now known) is a blockchain network that can run smart contracts and rolls up all of its transactions before settling them on Bitcoin. Stacks says it doesn\u2019t use a sidechain or layer-2 model, but founder Muneeb Ali told Decrypt in 2021 that he refers to it as \u201ca layer 1.5\u201d built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nThe STX token hit a peak above $3 in December 2021, according to CoinGecko, as its NFTs started to attract the Bitcoin faithful, and in February 2022, an NFT collection called Satoshibles launched a cross-bridge to send NFTs to the Ethereum network. Broadly, however, Stacks has not developed an especially active or valuable NFT market.\n\nBitcoin: Will It Run Doom? Kinda\n\nWhat's Ordinals?\n\nThe most recent example of Bitcoin NFTs is Ordinals, and it takes a different approach. Launched in January, Ordinals aims to add NFT-like assets directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nDesigned by Casey Rodarmor, a former Bitcoin Core contributor, Ordinals enables users to explore, transfer, and receive individual satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin, or 1/100,000,000 of a BTC), which may include data such as videos and images. Adding assets to individual satoshis is called inscription, which is stored in a Bitcoin transaction\u2019s signature.\n\nThe idea of filling Bitcoin blocks with JPEGs and videos\u2014or even playable video games\u2014isn\u2019t sitting well with some in the Bitcoin community who have voiced concerns that putting NFTs directly on the Bitcoin network will drive up transaction costs.\n\nMarginalized peoples in developing countries will have to pay more to run their Bitcoin nodes and send transactions because privileged wealthy whites want to put JPEG drawings on the blockchain as status symbols. Just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. \u2014 Bitcoin is Saving (@BitcoinIsSaving) January 29, 2023\n\nDespite the controversy, Ordinals brings the quest for NFTs on Bitcoin closer than ever, as it does not require a sidechain or layer-2 solution (or similar) or an additional cryptocurrency to work.\n\nBitcoin remains the top cryptocurrency by market cap, but as Ordinals and past examples show, some developers are still trying to use its decentralized network to power new use cases."

        "content": "MicroStrategy (MSTR) bought 8,813 bitcoins during 2022's major crypto dip, taking a $1.28 billion impairment loss for the year, the company said in its fourth quarter report on Thursday.\n\nAs of December 31, the company had spent a total $3.9 billion to acquire 132,500 bitcoins purchased at an average price of $30,137.\n\nThe company's carrying value of its bitcoin holdings at quarter's end was $1.8 billion. As of Thursday afternoon's bitcoin price, MicroStrategy's stash was worth $3.16 billion.\n\nShares of MicroStrategy were down as much as 3% in after hours trade on Thursday. Shares had gained more than 9% during normal trading hours on Thursday, and the stock has more than doubled so far this year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the business intelligence software company reported revenue of $132.6 million, just beating the $131 million expected by analysts, according to data from Bloomberg.\n\nMicroStrategy reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of $249.7 million.\n\n\"Our corporate strategy and conviction in acquiring, holding, and growing our bitcoin position for the long term remains unchanged,\" said MicroStrategy CFO Andrew Kang.\n\nMicroStrategy took a $197.6 million impairment charge for the fourth quarter on its bitcoin holdings, bringing its cumulative impairment charges related to bitcoin to $2.15 billion.\n\nThe company\u2019s founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has said previously that buying bitcoin has raised its public profile. Saylor stepped down in August from his role as CEO to focus on the company\u2019s bitcoin strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives.\n\nMicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor speaks at the Bitcoin 2021 Convention, a crypto-currency conference held at the Mana Convention Center in Wynwood on June 04, 2021 in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (Joe Raedle via Getty Images)\n\nTo buy bitcoin, MicroStrategy has issued corporate debt, convertible bonds, equity, and taken out a loan with some of its bitcoin.\n\nDuring the quarter, the company issued $46.2 million worth its stock, and as of December 31, MicroStrategy had around $450 million available for sale under its current authorizaton.\n\nOver its fourth quarter, MicroStrategy also sold bitcoin for the first time, harvesting its losses to offset capital gains tax, according to an SEC filing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's massive bitcoin write downs have also brought attention to how cryptocurrencies should be reported on a public corporation's balance sheet.\n\nBy current standards, crypto holdings must be recorded as intangible assets: when prices fall, the value must be written down to the lowest price point for the period. Alternatively, those assets can't be marked up when prices rise until they are sold.\n\nThe treatment will likely change by the end of 2024 according to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which voted Wednesday to issue a proposal for public comment by late March that would have corporates value some crypto at fair value like stocks.\n\nClick here for the latest crypto news, updates, values, prices, and more related to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, DeFi and NFTs\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube"

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 2.50% in the week from Jan. 27 to Feb. 3, trading at US$23,528 at 8 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether gained 4.47% in the same timeframe, to change hands at US$1,648.\n\nBitcoin surged 39.93% in January, rallying from US$16,496 at the start of the month to US$23,954 by Jan. 31, making it the best month since Oct. 2021, when the cryptocurrency also rallied more than 39%.\n\nDinesh Goel, founder of play-to-earn ecosystem One World Nation, said US$23,000 was a \u201cwait-and-watch level\u201d for Bitcoin holders. \u201cInvestors were optimistic that the Federal Reserve would give positive news but were also cautious of the impending recession fears. Overall, it has been a balanced outcome from the [Fed],\u201d wrote Goel in an email. Bitcoin will advance upwards, slowly and steadily, he added.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has signaled that it plans to raise interest rates further, but economist George Brown said the latest 25 basis point rate hike may have been the Fed\u2019s last.\n\n\u201cEconomic activity is beginning to soften as rate rises have gained traction. And forward-looking measures such as the Conference Board\u2019s leading indicator are flashing red.\u201d wrote Brown in a report shared with Forkast. \u201cThe labor market is showing tentative signs of turning\u2026 [and] inflation has convincingly moderated and should continue to do so.\u201d\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic was the week\u2019s biggest gainer among the 10 largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, up 10.43% on the weekly chart, trading at US$1.19.\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at US$1.08 trillion on Friday at 8 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 2.85% from US$1.05 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$461 billion represented 41.9% of the market, while Ether took up 18.7%.\n\nBiggest gainers\n\nThe Render Network\u2019s token (RNDR) was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe token jumped 103.09% to trade at US$1.70 after Render Network said it received governance approval for a burn and mint mechanism for its native token.\n\nThe Render Network allows idle GPUs (graphics processing units) to be used for the digital rendering needed in fields like 3D modeling, gaming imagery, and virtual reality.\n\nDecentralized derivatives exchange dYdX\u2019s native token (DYDX) rose 49.22% to US$3.19, making it the week\u2019s second-best gainer, after the exchange announced a lock-up extension for over 150 million tokens, meaning these tokens will only be released to early investors in December this year instead of February.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin mining fund soars as BTC powers into 2023\n\nWhat\u2019s ahead?\n\n\u201cThe general outlook and guidance are positive, which will ensure Bitcoin stays above $23,000 for a while,\u201d wrote Goel, adding that he expects more bullish momentum and that \u201cBitcoin will start testing the $25k level towards the end of this week.\u201c\n\n\u201cThe crypto market may see better days in the coming week since the market sentiment has been risk on. The FED\u2019s 25 basis point rate hike on Feb. 1 sent the dollar sliding. Based on the idea of the recent rate hike, cryptocurrencies may have a strong run-up going next week,\u201d wrote Adam Robertson, crypto market analyst and reporter at crypto.news.\n\nAsset management giant ARK Invest published the seventh edition of their report, Big Ideas 2023, on Feb. 1. The report estimates that the price of one Bitcoin could exceed US$1 million by 2030.\n\nArk outlines three scenarios for Bitcoin in 2030: a bear case, which puts it at US$258,500 with a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR); a base case, which estimates US$682,800 with a CAGR of 60%; and a bull case, which predicts that Bitcoin will grow with a 75% CAGR to reach US$1.48 million by 2030.\n\nOne World Nation\u2019s Goel said this prediction may be exaggerated: \u201cWhat they mean to say is \u2014 We believe in crypto, we believe in Bitcoin and it is the future,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cA US$1 million price will peg the Bitcoin market cap at US$21 trillion, ~17% of the world\u2019s 2030 projected GDP of US$126 trillion. This would need Bitcoin to be used by almost everyone in the world. And the current challenges are technology and regulation, which will take a while to get solved,\u201c said Goel.\n\nBitcoin analyst Willy Woo wrote that the recent gains can be linked to institutional buyers.\n\n\u201cThis recent rally coincides with a new pattern emerging of stablecoins flowing into exchanges during work days only. Seems to me like the heat signature of large institutions doing the buying,\u201d Woo said.\n\n\u201cSince this rally began, spot flows are dominant and leading over derivatives,\u201d wrote Woo, adding that spot buying is moving the price, which \u201cimplies that long-term institutional investors are coming in via spot buying and moving to custody.\u201d\n\nPseudonymous crypto analyst Rekt Capital tweeted: \u201cBTC would need to break beyond ~US$26500 to break the macro downtrend this February.\u201d \u201cThe price point that would represent the macro downtrend next month is ~$24600.\u201d\n\nSee related article: New Bitcoin protocol may shake up the NFT market"

        "content": "At the end of January, the Arizona legislature introduced a new bill to make Bitcoin (BTC 1.45%) legal tender within the state. If the bill passes into law, Arizona will become the first U.S. state where Bitcoin has the status of legal tender.\n\nThe move -- while it might appear quixotic to many crypto skeptics -- is actually similar to the one made by El Salvador back in September 2021, when it became the first nation in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender. Since then, the government of El Salvador, led by President Nayib Bukele, has become one of the staunchest supporters of Bitcoin on the world stage. So it's only natural to ask: What would be the implications of Arizona actually making Bitcoin legal tender?\n\nThe Arizona Bitcoin bill\n\nThe new Arizona bill formally states that Bitcoin can serve as a medium of exchange for \"the payment of debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.\" It would also require merchants to accept Bitcoin as payment for all commercial transactions. In essence, holding $20 worth of Bitcoin in your digital blockchain wallet would become the same as holding a physical $20 bill in your real-world leather wallet.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin is already legal within the United States, but the Arizona Bitcoin bill would add a whole new dimension. It would impact every business within Arizona, which had a state GDP of $337.42 billion in 2021. That's more than 10 times the size of El Salvador's national GDP. Moreover, the Arizona legislature also introduced a bill that would make cryptocurrency tax-exempt property. In other words, the state government couldn't tax you on your crypto holdings. If you're expecting Bitcoin to skyrocket to the moon, that's a big deal.\n\nBut does this Arizona bill actually have any chance of passing? On the surface, it would look highly unlikely. For one, the politician behind the Bitcoin push, state senator Wendy Rogers, attempted to pass this bill in 2022, and it failed on its second reading. Wendy Rogers is a highly polarizing figure within the world of Arizona politics, so she might have trouble getting true bipartisan support for the bill. And secondly, some legal experts say that the Bitcoin bill could be illegal under the \"contract clause\" of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits states from issuing their own money. So, even if the bill passes, it might get tied up in the courts for a long time.\n\nPotential impact\n\nHowever, Bitcoin bulls can certainly dream. In El Salvador, for example, the decision to make Bitcoin legal tender has had some notably positive effects. For one, Bitcoin has made it much easier for El Salvadorans living outside of the country to send remittances back home. This is important because El Salvador is one of the leading nations in the world when it comes to remittances. Bitcoin has also sparked a surge in \"crypto tourism\" for the country. One small beach town -- known as Bitcoin Beach -- has even been featured by CBS News' 60 Minutes. Based on that success, there are now plans to build a Bitcoin City in the country.\n\nSo, if you extend this example to Arizona, the new Bitcoin bill would certainly have an impact on migrants entering the state for work, given that Arizona shares a 370-mile border with Mexico. It would make it much easier for these migrants, who are most likely unbanked, to transmit remittances back home. And it might spark a crypto tourism boom for cities like Phoenix. Instead of Bitcoin Beach, Arizona would be able to promote Bitcoin Desert. Come visit the Grand Canyon, and then spend your Bitcoin in Phoenix!\n\nThere's another possible economic impact here, and that's the possibility of turning Arizona into a crypto hub. Tech entrepreneurs from Southern California might be tempted to relocate to Arizona, just as tech entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are now relocating to Texas. Add in the fact that Arizona is trying to make crypto tax-exempt property, and you can immediately see how Arizona might become an attractive locale for anyone who believes in the future of crypto.\n\nThe global allure of Bitcoin\n\nAt some point, Arizona might turn into a real $337 billion market opportunity for Bitcoin. That would only happen if everyone within the state started to embrace Bitcoin, of course. And that would likely only happen if there is another great Bitcoin bull market rally in which everyone is getting rich. When El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, that was the situation.\n\nThat being said, even skeptics have to acknowledge that Bitcoin has been gaining legitimacy worldwide of late. In December 2022, for example, Brazil passed a sweeping new Bitcoin bill. The Pacific island nation of Fiji also elected a pro-Bitcoin prime minister. In addition, several Caribbean island nations are now planning to make crypto legal tender.\n\nSo Arizona is not some outlier on the world stage. I'm bullish on Bitcoin long-term, and I'm hopeful that Bitcoin will one day be able to take advantage of Grand Canyon-sized market opportunities like the one in Arizona."

        "title": "Bitcoin Ordinals creator looks for fix after first instance of shock porn - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Only days after the launch of the Bitcoin (BTC)-based Ordinals protocol, its creator had to deal with their first shock pornographic image, which has been inscribed into the blockchain.\n\nOn Feb. 2 at around 12:15 am UTC, an unsavory image known as \u201cgoatse\u201d was inscribed onto the Bitcoin blockchain via the Ordinals protocol.\n\nIt featured on inscription 668 and was live on the Ordinals\u2019 front page for roughly half an hour before the image was removed. It still exists on the blockchain but is not able to be viewed using the Ordinals website.\n\nOrdinals creator Casey Rodarmor told Cointelegraph he acted quickly to remove the image from the Ordinals website but admitted there isn\u2019t much that can be done to stop future instances given the nature of the protocol.\n\nHe is at least working on a solution to stop the images appearing on the Ordinals website.\n\nThe image, known as \u201cgoatse,\u201d depicts a man manipulating his anus. Due to its shock value, it\u2019s often used to trick internet users.\n\nRodamor said for the moment, that there was no way to hide certain inscriptions on the Ordinals\u2019 website without manual input.\n\n\u201cThe explorer has a config file that can be used to hide certain inscriptions, so we decided that was not very pleasant to look at,\u201d he said. \u201cWe added it to that config file and now the server does not return that inscription and will not return that content.\u201d\n\nOrdinals has a simplistic website with every new inscription appearing on its home page.\n\nWhile Rodarmor plans to have a \u201cvery liberal content policy\u201d where people will \u201ccertainly\u201d be able to inscribe pornographic images, he would like to censor them until he finds a way to automatically keep them off the first page, such as creating a separate space for them on the website.\n\nRecent inscriptions on the Ordinals site show users are inscribing images of Pepe the Frog, a cartoon internet meme. Sou: Ordinals\n\nCritics of blockchain technology have concerns that its immutable nature could be used to forever host illegal or grotesque media, while others argue its censorship resistance should be viewed as a key feature.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the criticism Ordinals may receive for censoring certain images, Rodarmor responded:\n\n\u201cThe inscription is still on the chain and if you run your own copy of Ordinal \u2014 which everybody is free to do \u2014 it will not have that config file and you will see the gaping butthole if that is what you so desire.\u201d\n\nHe added his site is just one instance of the block explorer and hopes others create more where they can \u201cimplement their own moderation policies according to their tastes.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018WTH did I just witness?' Magic Eden turns porno after hosting service hacked\n\nRodarmor said it\u2019s only the second time he\u2019s censored a pornographic image. He believes the technical difficulty and cost of inscribing an image onto the BTC network have reduced the instances of such trolling attempts.\n\nOrdinals launched on Jan. 21 and immediately divided the crypto community with arguments on whether it was good for the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nThe protocol works by inscribing satoshis \u2014 the native currency of the Bitcoin network \u2014 with content such as images to make NFT-like structures that can be transferred.\n\nThe cost of inscribing a satoshi can cost tens of dollars in comparison to a regular network transaction that ranges from a few cents to a few dollars."

        "content": "Bitcoin has rallied more than 40% since the start of the year, quickly paring losses from its disastrous 2022. However, Wolfe Research thinks it isn't go time for the crypto bulls just yet. \"Bitcoin is still trading at the deepest overbought condition in over two years,\" the firm's Rob Ginsberg said in a note this week. \"Sometimes these extended overbought signals can be a sign of momentum, but our sense is that it's overdue for a brake check.\" The cryptocurrency is on pace to finish the week higher again, by about 2%, according to Coin Metrics. Overnight on Tuesday, the price climbed up to $24,249.70, its highest level since Aug. 17 and close to Wolfe's secondary target of $24,500. After finishing 2022 down 64%, bitcoin surged 39.6% in January, which was its best month since October 2021 and its best January performance since 2013. BTC.CM= mountain 2021-03-01 Bitcoin headed for 'brake check'? Investor sentiment got a boost in January from lower inflation readings and optimism around the possibility the Federal Reserve will soon slow down its inflation-fighting rate hikes. After the Federal Reserve said the \"disinflationary process has started\" at the conclusion of its policy meeting, bitcoin rose again. Ginsberg said he's \"encouraged by this initial breakout attempt\" and sees the bullish trend as a structural shift, but that a \"healthy digestion of gains is in order.\" \"An overbought condition this extreme simply is unsustainable regardless of the security,\" he said. \"Expect bitcoin to fall back within its range before seeing any near term upward moves.\" \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "title": "Did Goldman Sachs Just Give Bitcoin a Seal of Approval? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "For crypto investors, 2022 is starting to feel like a distant memory. In 2023, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC 1.50%) are soaring and investor appetite is returning for even the riskiest tokens. Even Goldman Sachs Group (GS 1.06%) -- once a critic of the crypto asset class -- is getting into the act. According to a new Goldman Sachs report, Bitcoin is now the best-performing asset in the world on both an absolute and risk-adjusted basis.\n\nThe findings from that report could have important implications for Bitcoin's future price trajectory. Remember, it was just one year ago that Goldman Sachs slapped a $100,000 price target on Bitcoin, so this report might mark the much-anticipated return of bullish sentiment for crypto on Wall Street in 2023.\n\nRisk-adjusted versus absolute returns\n\nGoldman Sachs compared both risk-adjusted and absolute returns across 25 different asset classes. Bitcoin ranked No. 1 in absolute returns and No. 1 in terms of risk-adjusted returns. The next closest competitor was the MSCI Emerging Markets index, but it wasn't even close. The MSCI Emerging Markets index offered a lower absolute return and lower risk-adjusted returns as well.\n\nIn order to calculate risk-adjusted returns, Goldman Sachs used a popular metric called the Sharpe ratio, which compares the return of an investment with its underlying risk and volatility. In short, it's not enough to say that Bitcoin is now up nearly 40% year to date, because everyone knows that crypto is a very risky and volatile asset class. You are taking on tremendous risk to generate those returns. If another investment could generate those same returns by taking on less risk, it would be superior.\n\nThat's why I was blown away by the Goldman Sachs numbers. Even taking into account all the inherent volatility of crypto, Bitcoin was still a better investment than any other asset class on the planet. It beat out risky assets like emerging market stocks and high-yield debt, and it beat out much safer investments like gold and the S&P 500. The Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin was 3.1, which is absolutely phenomenal. When calculating this ratio, anything between 1 and 2 is considered good, and anything between 2 and 3 is very good. So Bitcoin absolutely hit it out of the park in January.\n\nThe implications\n\nThis is great news for crypto as an asset class, and could make Bitcoin much more palatable for institutional investors with a low risk tolerance. In 2022, Goldman Sachs began offering new Bitcoin-related products and services to clients, and this January report might be the key to offering even more in 2023. After all, when FTX collapsed last year, it was rumored Goldman Sachs was going to start buying crypto assets on the cheap. Could this bullish report on Bitcoin be the prelude to new moves by Goldman Sachs in the crypto market?\n\nThe big caveat here is that one month is a short period of time. Just because Bitcoin soared in January doesn't mean it's headed straight up for the rest of 2023. Crypto still remains a risky and volatile asset class. If you're a crypto skeptic, you could just as easily interpret the new Goldman Sachs data on risk-adjusted returns to mean: If you're crazy enough to take on all the volatility of crypto, then Bitcoin gives you the best bang for your buck.\n\nMoreover, consider just how quickly sentiment can change. In December, Goldman Sachs released completely contradictory findings suggesting that gold is a better investment than Bitcoin. At that time, the outlook for the economy looked bleak and it might have been natural to assume that gold would continue to outperform Bitcoin in 2023. But, as we've seen through the first month of this year, that hasn't been the case.\n\nThe big picture for Bitcoin\n\nTaking a big-picture view, it's clear the macroeconomic outlook for the economy plays a major role in how investors view Bitcoin. At one time, people thought Bitcoin's performance was completely uncorrelated with the broader financial market, but now that appears to be false. As the broader market goes, so goes Bitcoin. The good news is, that at least according to Goldman Sachs, Bitcoin looks like one of the best investments you can make if you believe U.S. economic growth is returning.\n\nGoing forward, I'm keeping a close eye on what's happening with institutional investors in the crypto market. If they are bullish on Bitcoin, then that's a good sign. It means there will be tremendous support for the crypto asset class from some of the smartest investors in the world. As they allocate some of their portfolios to crypto, that could push up the value of Bitcoin. For that reason, I remain bullish on Bitcoin both short- and long-term."

        "content": "The first steps of a multi-stage plan to regulate the cryptocurrency industry within Australia have been released.\n\nThe Australian government has announced the first step of what it calls a multi-stage approach to tackling cryptocurrency regulation.\n\nAccording to the announcement, \u201cthe multi\u2011stage approach has three elements: strengthening enforcement, bolstering consumer protection; and establishing a framework for reform.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe first step begins with the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) increasing the size of its crypto team and \u201cupping enforcement measures.\u201d These enforcement measures described include taking legal action when cryptocurrencies are marketed without appropriate financial licenses. In addition, the report describes that particular attention will be paid to making sure risks are properly disclosed to consumers.\n\n\n\nThese steps are intended to step up efforts targeting scams, especially those involving cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThe Government\u2019s National Anti\u2011Scams Centre, located within the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), will facilitate real\u2011time data sharing and the coordinated prevention and disruption of scams,\u201d reads the report, indicating that the collection of data will be a major part of the operations.\n\nIn addition to the steps announced today, the government introduced a token mapping consultation paper addressing \u201cwhich elements of the crypto ecosystem are sufficiently regulated and which require additional attention.\u201d The paper addresses Bitcoin specifically, describing it as a cryptocurrency network with the intent to operate as a \u201cpeer-to-peer payment structure,\u201d as a \u201cnew form of currency.\u201d In addition, the use cases of Bitcoin are illustrated, including its use as a store of value, and as a medium of exchange, \u201cparticularly in emerging markets.\u201d\n\nThe Australian government's multi-stage approach to cryptocurrency regulation is designed to protect consumers while also providing oversight and regulatory clarity, but it remains to be seen if this regulatory environment will stifle growth and innovation, or fulfill its intended purpose while harboring growth.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "While billionaire Ray Dalio believes that fiat is in jeopardy, he also thinks that neither Bitcoin (BTC) nor stablecoins are the answer. In response, crypto community members took to Twitter to express their opinion on the topic.\n\nIn a recent interview on CNBC\u2019s Squawk, Dalio shared his takes on Bitcoin being a potential solution to the problems with fiat currency. The billionaire argued that it would not be effective as a store holder of wealth and a medium of exchange. Dalio also highlighted that stablecoins are a replica of state-backed currencies and would also not be an effective form of money.\n\nBitcoiners were quick to respond to the interview, commenting that Bitcoin already fits Dalio's description of what money should be. A community member tweeted:\n\nA community member's thoughts on the topic. Source: Twitter\n\nAdditionally, a Twitter user cited various inherent features of Bitcoin and pointed out that it\u2019s the solution Dalio is looking for. According to the community member, Bitcoin\u2019s censorship resistance, neutrality, openness, limited supply and freedom from control make it the answer to the monetary problem that Dalio described.\n\nMeanwhile, another Bitcoin community member said that they were \u201corange pilled\u201d by Dalio from his insights on the history of money. The Twitter user believes that the interview shows that the billionaire is close to \u201ctruly understanding Bitcoin.\u201c\n\nRelated: Billionaire Ray Dalio 'impressed' how Bitcoin survived the last decade\n\nDalio has historically gone back and forth regarding his position on Bitcoin. In 2021, he went from describing Bitcoin as \u201cone hell of an invention\u201d to a more negative narrative, speaking of a potential ban on Bitcoin in the United States and saying that he would choose gold over Bitcoin.\n\nIn 2022, the billionaire recommended a 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation for investor portfolios. Back then, Dalio praised BTC for its resilience against hacks and said that it has no better competitor in the market."

        "content": "Smaller bitcoin devotees are colloquially known as HODLrs, as in \u201cholding on for dear life.\u201d Indeed, the largest digital currency and many of its peers can be volatile assets that try investors\u2019 patience and ability to hold over lengthy periods.\n\nStill, some market observers believe bitcoin offers massive upside from current prices of just below $24,000. In fact, some believe the cryptocurrency could appreciate dozens of times over during the next decade, indicating that there could be significant rewards for market participants with the temerity to hold even a small amount of bitcoin for an extend period.\n\nIn its new 2023 Big Ideas report, ARK Investment Management estimated that bitcoin could run to $1 million in the next decade \u2014 easily one of the most bullish forecasts around.\n\n\u201cWe believe Bitcoin\u2019s long-term opportunity is strengthening. Despite a turbulent year, Bitcoin has not skipped a beat. Its network fundamentals have strengthened and its holder base has become more long-term focused,\u201d according to ARK. \u201cContagion caused by centralized counterparties has elevated Bitcoin\u2019s value propositions: decentralization, auditability, and transparency.\u201d\n\nARK\u2019s bitcoin forecast emerges after the digital currency notched an impressive January, erasing some of its 2022 declines. Speaking of bitcoin\u2019s 2022 bear market, as ARK noted, it was the fifth-largest in terms of value shed and second-longest from a time perspective.\n\nAs 2022 drew to a close, some crypto market observers noted that deep, extended bitcoin declines historically gave way to the reverse scenario: significant rallies. It remains to be seen if that history repeats this year, but it\u2019s a fact that bitcoin needs to almost triple to reclaim the all-time of around $69,000.\n\nOwing to bitcoin\u2019s aforementioned reputation for volatility, some investors may be more apt to take quick gains and not wait around for prices to double, let alone triple. However, historical data indicate that bitcoin has previously displayed merit as a long-term holding.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s volatility has obscured its long-term returns. Despite five drawdowns greater than 75% since its inception in 2009, bitcoin has delivered positive annualized returns over 3-, 4-, and 5-year time horizons,\u201d added ARK.\n\nAdding to the bitcoin case are data points suggesting, as ARK pointed out, that many investors weren\u2019t spooked by the collapse of crypto broker FTX and the ensuing contagion effect. Said another way, some investors realized that FTX likely perpetrated fraud and that wasn\u2019t necessarily direct commentary on crypto fundamentals.\n\n\u201cDespite extreme market fear fueled by the collapse of several major crypto entities, on-chain data suggest that bitcoin holders remained focused on long-term fundamentals,\u201d concluded ARK.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel .\n\nThe opinions and forecasts expressed herein are solely those of Tom Lydon, and may not actually come to pass.

        "content": "A New Jersey man admitted to paying $20,000 in cryptocurrency to have a 14-year-old child murdered, according to a news release from the Department of Justice on Thursday.\n\nJohn Michael Musbach, 31, pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with one count of \"knowingly and intentionally using and causing another to use a facility of interstate and foreign commerce, that is the internet, with the intent that a murder be committed,\" according to the news release.\n\nMusbach is a resident of Haddonfield, N.J., but lived in Atlantic County when he first made contact with the unidentified victim, prosecutors say. The victim lived in New York at the time.\n\nMusbach exchanged sexually explicit photos and videos with the victim in the summer of 2015, the DOJ said, and the victim's parents called police when they found out about the \"inappropriate contact.\" New York law enforcement officers identified Musbach as an Atlantic County resident and contacted the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office (ACPO). In March 2016, ACPO officers arrested Musbach on child pornography charges, the DOJ said.\n\nAfter Musbach was arrested, he \"decided to have the victim killed so the victim could not testify against him in the pending criminal case,\" prosecutors allege. During a two-week period in May 2016, Musbach \"repeatedly communicated\" with the administrator of a murder-for-hire website on the dark net, the DOJ said. The website, which was not named by the DOJ, purported to offer contract killings or other violent acts in return for cryptocurrency payments.\n\nMusbach allegedly arranged for a murder-to-hire and asked the purported hit man if \"a 14-year-old was too young to target.\" Prosecutors say Musbach then paid $20,000 in bitcoin for the hit. After Musbach asked the website's administrator for more details about the hit and when it would occur, he was pressed for an additional $5,000, the DOJ said.\n\nWhen Musbach then tried to cancel the hit, the website administrator revealed the \"website was a scam,\" and threatened to reveal Musbach's information to law enforcement, prosecutors said.\n\nThe DOJ did not say if it was the website administrator who made authorities aware of Musbach's murder-for-hire plot.\n\nThe charge of use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of at least $250,000, the DOJ said. Musbach is scheduled to be sentenced on June 13."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFor nearly a decade, creators have enlisted sidechain or layer-2 solutions to link digital art to the Bitcoin blockchain. But how this is accomplished\u2014or whether it should even be done\u2014has Crypto Twitter up in arms after new project Ordinals developed a way to add digital items to on-chain Bitcoin transactions.\n\nNFT are blockchain tokens that can serve as a proof of ownership for assets, including digital goods like artwork, videos, music files, and memberships. While blockchains like Ethereum and Solana are synonymous with NFTs and digital collectibles, many Bitcoin developers have sought ways to bring them to the quintessential blockchain.\n\nOne issue hampering the development of NFTs on Bitcoin is the need for smart contracts. In the minting process, NFTs use smart contracts to assign ownership of the digital asset in the NFT. The smart contract updates the ownership when the NFT is bought or sold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin has only limited smart contract support.\n\nTo address this, earlier projects like Counterparty and Stacks developed alternative solutions that use a native token for the contract piece but ultimately settle their transactions back on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nEarlier examples\n\nIn 2014, Counterparty launched the first layer-2 solution for digital assets using the Bitcoin blockchain. Counterparty, which provides the infrastructure for users to create unique tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, saw its XCP token hit an all-time high above $91 in 2018, but it has fallen about 97% since.\n\nAlthough surpassed by Ethereum and other popular NFT chains in recent years, Counterparty still has an active community of supporters\u2014and its assets can be bridged to Ethereum. More importantly, Counterparty is best known as the home for historical assets like Rare Pepes, which still command significant sums on secondary markets. In April 2022, an NFT containing the opening theme to Larry David\u2019s \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d was minted using Counterparty.\n\nLaunched in 2017 as Blockstacks, Stacks (as it\u2019s now known) is a blockchain network that can run smart contracts and rolls up all of its transactions before settling them on Bitcoin. Stacks says it doesn\u2019t use a sidechain or layer-2 model, but founder Muneeb Ali told Decrypt in 2021 that he refers to it as \u201ca layer 1.5\u201d built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe STX token hit a peak above $3 in December 2021, according to CoinGecko, as its NFTs started to attract the Bitcoin faithful, and in February 2022, an NFT collection called Satoshibles launched a cross-bridge to send NFTs to the Ethereum network. Broadly, however, Stacks has not developed an especially active or valuable NFT market.\n\nWhat's Ordinals?\n\nThe most recent example of Bitcoin NFTs is Ordinals, and it takes a different approach. Launched in January, Ordinals aims to add NFT-like assets directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nDesigned by Casey Rodarmor, a former Bitcoin Core contributor, Ordinals enables users to explore, transfer, and receive individual satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin, or 1/100,000,000 of a BTC), which may include data such as videos and images. Adding assets to individual satoshis is called inscription, which is stored in a Bitcoin transaction\u2019s signature.\n\nThe idea of filling Bitcoin blocks with JPEGs and videos\u2014or even playable video games\u2014isn\u2019t sitting well with some in the Bitcoin community who have voiced concerns that putting NFTs directly on the Bitcoin network will drive up transaction costs.\n\nMarginalized peoples in developing countries will have to pay more to run their Bitcoin nodes and send transactions because privileged wealthy whites want to put JPEG drawings on the blockchain as status symbols. Just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. \u2014 Bitcoin is Saving (@BitcoinIsSaving) January 29, 2023\n\nDespite the controversy, Ordinals brings the quest for NFTs on Bitcoin closer than ever, as it does not require a sidechain or layer-2 solution (or similar) or an additional cryptocurrency to work.\n\nBitcoin remains the top cryptocurrency by market cap, but as Ordinals and past examples show, some developers are still trying to use its decentralized network to power new use cases."

We also find out what he\u2019s looking forward to the most this year in the crypto market and how 2023 is going to differ from 2022.\n\nThe big question on everyone\u2019s minds is What will be the catalyst that brings institutional investors back into the crypto markets, and how can they avoid the same risks that crippled them before? Are regulations the answer?\n\nSeveral cryptocurrency exchanges have come under regulatory fire recently. It might only be a matter of time before Binance gets some confrontation from high-level enforcement agencies. Keeping this in mind, we ask White what trends he sees emerging with centralized exchanges in the near future.\n\nWe dive into the topic of regulation and what role it should play in crypto, especially within centralized exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nGot an idea for a nonfungible token project but no experience in programming, smart contracts or anything related to crypto? Don\u2019t worry, we ask White what the best way to launch your collection on OpenSea safely is.

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe global crypto market cap is now at $1.09 trillion, up 3.88% over the last day, according to the latest figures from Coinmarketcap.\n\nMeanwhile, BTC tipped slightly over $24,000 for the first time in 2023, reaching $24,161.27 according to Coinmarketcap.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin bulls plan to flip $23K to support by aiming to win this week\u2019s $1B options expiry\n\nThat being said, Powell said they still expect inflation to continue rising in the services sector for some time and to be prepared for \u201congoing rate rises.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see ourselves as having more persistent inflation in that [services] sector, which will take longer to get down, and we have to complete the job. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.\u201d\n\nPowell noted that \u201congoing rate rises\u201d would still be appropriate as the Federal Reserve attempts to bring inflation back to its 2% target level.\n\nIt should be noted that disinflation refers to a slowdown in the rate of increase of general price levels, as opposed to deflation, where the general price level of goods and services decreases."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) bullish surge in January has helped the Nasdaq Crypto Index to register its third-highest monthly gain, with a 38% surge. The cryptocurrency market started the year bullish, defying major bearish market outlooks. Bitcoin and a number of altcoins touched new multi-month highs as inflation cooled off.\n\nNasdaq Crypto Index monthly price chart Source: Google\n\nThe Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI) recorded its third-biggest monthly gain since its inception in February 2021. The crypto asset index was launched by Brazilian asset manager Hashdex in partnership with the Nasdaq stock exchange. The index consists of eight cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), and Stellar (XLM), among a few others.\n\nBTC has the highest weight in the index (69.8%), followed by ETH (27.08%). The other altcoins have a weight of less than 1%. Thus, the subsequent rise of BTC and ETH, which have surged over 35% in the past month, is also reflected in the index. The index weight refers to the share of stocks invested in a particular digital asset.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin bulls must reclaim these 2 levels as 'death cross' still looms\n\nWith a prolonged crypto winter throughout 2022, Bitcoin ended the year at around $16,500, with most altcoins also testing their yearly lows. Many market pundits had warned that the bearish sentiment might continue into the new year owing to the FTX saga unfolding daily. However, the crypto market showed resilience and started the year on a bullish note, registering a double-digit gain for the past month.\n\nOn Feb. 1, the Federal Open Market Committee press briefing announced an interest rate hike of 25 basis points. The United States Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, suggested that inflation has started to cool off in the world\u2019s largest economy. The Fed raise worked wonders for the crypto market, with BTC briefly touching $24,000 and the crypto market cap rising by 4%."

        "content": "The second largest publicly-listed holder of Bitcoin, crypto mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings has offloaded some of its Bitcoin (BTC) for the first time in two years.\n\nA spokesman told Cointelegraph this was not a result of financial distress.\n\nAccording to an update posted on Feb. 2, the company disclosed that during January it sold 1,500 BTC, worth $35.3 million at current prices.\n\nWhile some crypto miners have been forced to sell Bitcoin due to distress, Marathon vice president of corporate communications Charlie Schumacher said this was not the case for Marathon.\n\nMarathon Digital's Bitcoin Mining Data Center in Hardin, Montana. Source: Marathon Digital\n\nSchumacher said that Marathon had been diamond-handing its Bitcoin until now, as the firm didn\u2019t want to sell while production was down, and has been bullish on the long-term prospects of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nBut coming into the new year, Marathon wants to have a \u201cwar-chest\u201d of liquidity composed of both cash and Bitcoin and is looking to continue paying down debt and increase its cash positions.\n\nSchumacher also noted that Bitcoin\u2019s recent uptick in price contributed to the decision to sell some of its holdings.\n\nJanuary saw Bitcoin rise above the $24,000 price level for the first time since August.\n\nEven after the sale, Marathon managed to increase its unrestricted Bitcoin holdings in the month to 8,090 BTC ($189.8 million).\n\nOperational highlights from Marathon\u2019s latest update. Source: Marathon Digital Holdings\n\nMarathon said it also had significantly ramped up Bitcoin production throughout January, producing 687 BTC, which represents an increase of 45% compared to the month prior. In the update, Marathon chairman and CEO Fred Thiel noted:\n\n\u201cThe improvement in our bitcoin production was primarily a result of our team\u2019s ability to work in tandem with the new hosting provider in McCamey, Texas, to address the maintenance and technical issues at the King Mountain data center that had suppressed our bitcoin production in the fourth quarter of 2022.\"\n\nLast year, Marathon noted in a May 4 update that the last time it had sold any Bitcoin was on Oct. 21, 2020, and has been hodling since then.\n\nWhen asked how it had managed to avoid selling the main product of its business operations, Schumacher pointed to the firm\u2019s low headcount, consisting of \u201c32 people as of today,\u201d and suggested it was a result of sound long-term financial strategies.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price is up, but BTC mining stocks could remain vulnerable throughout 2023\n\nMarathon is the second-biggest publicly listed holder of Bitcoin according to CoinGecko, beaten only by software analytics company MicroStrategy. It has recorded a significant boost in its share price in recent days, with MARA stock rising 135% so far this year to $8, according to MarketWatch."

        "title": "Bitcoin's big month: Did US institutions prevail over Asian retail traders? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin experienced the second-strongest January in its history \u2014 and the best since 2013 \u2014 rising nearly 40% amid wide reports that institutional investors were back on board.\n\nZhong Yang Chan, head of research at CoinGecko, told Cointelegraph that there were \u201cnet institutional inflows into digital asset funds in January 2023, particularly in the last two weeks, with Bitcoin the largest beneficiary.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a Jan. 30 CoinShares blog noted that the total assets under management in digital asset investment products \u2014 a good gauge of institutional participation \u2014 had risen to $28 billion, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which was up 43% from November 2022\u2019s low point in the current cycle.\n\nThe reasons for this bullishness varied depending on whom one asked, ranging from macro factors like a pause in inflation growth to more technical reasons like a squeeze on BTC short sellers. Elsewhere, a research report from Matrixport noted that institutional investors are \u201cnot giving up on crypto,\u201d further suggesting that as much as 85% of Bitcoin buying in January was the result of U.S. institutional players. The cryptocurrency services provider added that many investors had used the U.S. Jan. 12 Consumer Price Index print \u201cas a confirmation signal to buy Bitcoin and other crypto assets.\u201d\n\nAlmost all gains were during U.S. market hours\n\nBut how did Matrixport come to attribute up to 85% of monthly BTC growth to U.S. institutional investors? As the Singapore-based firm explained in its recent market overview: \u201cThe most astonishing statistic is that almost all of the +40% year-to-date rally in Bitcoin has happened during US market hours. [...] That\u2019s 85% of the Bitcoin move.\u201d Matrixport continued:\n\n\u201cWe have always worked with the assumption that Asia is driven by retail investors, and the US is driven by institutional investors.\u201d\n\nSo, if Bitcoin\u2019s market price rises during U.S. market trading hours but falls during Asian trading hours, as seemed to be happening in January, can one assume that U.S. institutional investors were buying Bitcoin while Asian retail traders were selling it \u2014 a sort of yin-and-yang action? Apparently so. During U.S. trading hours, \u201cinstitutions, aka \u2018stable hands,\u2019\u201d were taking advantage of the dips, added Matrixport.\n\nRecent: State of play: Decentralized domain services reflect on industry progress\n\nIs this really what drove BTC\u2019s price upward in January? \u201cIn my personal opinion, the assumption that Asian retail and U.S. institutional investors are two main drivers of net Bitcoin flows is valid,\u201d Keone Hon, co-founder and CEO at Monad Labs \u2014 which developed the Monad blockchain \u2014 told Cointelegraph. There are other market participants, of course; but when looking at flows, \u201cirregular ones\u201d have the largest impact, continued Hon:\n\n\u201cIn the current market, institutional players represent a potentially new \u2014 or renewed \u2014 source of demand similar to early 2021. Meanwhile, on the retail side, Asia-centric exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Okex and Huobi represent a majority of spot volume and nearly all of the derivatives volume.\u201d\n\nOthers, though, aren\u2019t so sure. \u201cThere is no way to confirm that U.S. markets are driven by institutional investors and Asian markets are driven by retail players since we don\u2019t have data related to the identity of traders,\u201d Jacob Joseph, research analyst at CryptoCompare, told Cointelegraph.\n\nGranted, there is a \u201csentiment\u201d or belief that large retail interest exists in Asia, \u201cespecially in Korea, as KRW represents the fourth-largest trading pair after USDT, BUSD and USD,\u201d continued Joseph, but it can\u2019t really be quantified.\n\nStill, he acknowledged that the Matrixport report was interesting, adding, \u201cOur data shows that more than two-thirds of the BTC returns in January can be attributed to the U.S. market hours, and our historical hourly data also shows that an above-average volume is traded during these hours.\u201d\n\nJustin d\u2019Anethan, institutional sales director at the Amber Group \u2014 a Singapore-based digital asset firm \u2014 told Cointelegraph, \u201cI don\u2019t really have metrics to say whether 85% is on point or not.\u201d He was inclined to see the January rally as broad and macro-driven, especially with inflation heading lower and expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve won\u2019t keep raising rates. He added:\n\n\u201cYou can see equities, gold, real estate, and, yes, crypto gaining. That\u2019s probably driven by large institutions and smaller investors alike, especially when FOMO kicks in.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Anethan also looked at Coinbase\u2019s recent premium index, \u201cwhich is in the green but not massively. That\u2019s typically a good metric to see if bigger American entities are on a shopping spree. Right now, it looks muted, positive, but probably just reallocating cash that was sitting on the sidelines.\u201d\n\nJacob said that a better way to gauge U.S. institutional activity is to look at exchanges \u201cthat cater their services solely to them.\u201d Along these lines, \u201cCME Group, the largest institutional exchange in crypto, saw its monthly volume rise 59% in January,\u201d while LMAX Digital, another institutional-focused exchange, \u201calso saw its trading volumes rise 84.1%, higher than the average increase in trading volume on other exchanges.\u201d\n\nThen, too, who\u2019s to say Asian retail traders aren\u2019t operating during U.S. market hours? Chan, for instance, acknowledged that while the markets \u201cdo tend to move more during U.S. hours,\u201d CoinGecko believes that this is \u201cmore a reflection of the outsized influence that U.S. monetary policy currently has on the crypto market and broader financial markets. Traders are most active when they believe markets are volatile, and in the current environment, Asian traders may have also gravitated toward \u2018Fed watching\u2019 to catch potential market movements.\u201d\n\nChris Kuiper, director of research at Fidelity Digital Assets, told Cointelegraph that there isn\u2019t a single event or catalyst that one can point to, to explain Bitcoin\u2019s recent price movement. But to him, \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising given the conditions that have been forming \u2014 namely, the increasing amount of illiquid coins, coins that haven\u2019t moved in over a year \u2014 and the continued outflow of coins from exchanges.\u201d Both factors make for a lower supply of BTC \u201cand create conditions ripe for higher moves.\u201d\n\nKuiper also cited the futures and derivatives market as a factor in BTC\u2019s climb, \u201cwith a large amount of shorts getting liquidated over the past few weeks.\u201d D\u2019Anethan, too, mentioned \u201cshort-sellers getting squeezed\u201d as a possible driver. \u201cIn itself, it\u2019s not a cause for [prices] going up, but when things do rise, it accelerates it.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead\n\nBe that as it may, if one agrees that January held some promise for Bitcoin on the institutional front, can one necessarily assume that it will persist through 2023?\n\n\u201cAs the market gains clarity on which players avoided contagion, we\u2019ll see an uptick in new entrants that were sidelined during the back half of last year, particularly as innovative custody agreements emerge to address the major pain points of the recent collapses,\u201d David Wells, CEO of digital asset trading platform Enclave Markets, told Cointelegraph.\n\nRecent: What crypto hodlers should keep in mind as tax season approaches\n\nMore needs to be done to maintain institutional momentum, the executive stated. \u201cTo really attract institutional flow, crypto markets will need to build more sophisticated products that allow for proper hedging and risk management,\u201d added Wells. He\u2019s optimistic providers will rise to the challenge, however.\n\nIt appears that inflation may have peaked, and many expect the U.S. Fed and perhaps other central banks to slow the pace at which they tighten interest rates, said Kuiper. While that does not necessarily portend rising risk-asset prices, \u201cinstitutions and other asset allocators in the longer-term may once again turn to Bitcoin if central banks ease aggressively as they have done in the past,\u201d he concluded."

        "title": "Community mocks Charlie Munger for his obsession with China's Bitcoin ban - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency community has ridiculed well-known Bitcoin (BTC) critic Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, for calling the United States to follow in the footsteps of China and ban crypto.\n\nIn an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal, the 99-year-old investment veteran has once again slammed crypto, calling a cryptocurrency a \u201cgambling contract with a nearly 100% edge for the house.\u201d\n\nMunger also said that a cryptocurrency is \u201cnot a currency, not a commodity, and not a security,\u201d adding that \u201cobviously\u201d the U.S. should enact a new federal law that would ban crypto.\n\nAccording to Munger, the best way to approach crypto is to follow the example of China, which put a blanket ban on crypto in September 2021. The Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman stated:\n\n\u201cWhat should the U.S. do after a ban of cryptocurrencies is in place? Well, one more action might make sense: Thank the Chinese communist leader for his splendid example of uncommon sense.\u201d\n\nThe community was quick to react to Munger\u2019s latest anti-crypto arguments, with many expressing bewilderment about how measures like China\u2019s crypto ban stack up with the United States\u2019 proclamations that it supports freedom.\n\n\u201cThe battle lines are being drawn. Freedom or tyranny. Non-custodial wallets are the hill we can\u2019t surrender,\u201d NFT APE author Adam McBride wrote on Twitter.\n\nOthers also mocked Munger for not understanding that crypto is virtually unbannable. Indeed, even after \u201cbanning\u201d crypto in 2021, China has continued to be the second-largest Bitcoin miner in the world, and possessing crypto is apparently still legal. Moreover, the idea of lifting the crypto ban has been floating around in China for a while.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that Charlie munger believes he\u2019s doing something by calling for a ban. Doesn\u2019t understand it\u2019s math and can\u2019t be banned. Old age deteriorates critical thinking skills. \u2014 941 (@level941) February 2, 2023\n\nGiven that Munger called cryptocurrency a \u201cgambling contract,\u201d it\u2019s worth noting that gambling is legal under U.S. federal law, despite people losing significant money from it.\n\nRelated: EU lawmakers vote for more restrictive capital requirements on banks holding crypto\n\nAccording to data from the American Gaming Association, U.S. casinos and mobile gaming apps hit a record $54.93 billion in revenue during the first 11 months of 2022. The revenues came at the cost of Americans losing more money on gambling than ever before by the first quarter of 2022.\n\nMany European countries also allow at least some gambling, with about 420,000 British gamblers losing more than $2,000 per year.\n\nDespite casinos causing significant losses for investors, Europe and the U.S. have not followed in the footsteps of China, which banned most forms of gambling back in 1949."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining company Luxor mined the largest ever Bitcoin block on Feb. 1 in order to promote what seems to be a potential NFT collection.\n\nThe block contained an NFT based on the original \"magic internet money\" meme but featuring the name Taproot Wizards. The block was 3.96 MB in size, just shy of Bitcoin's 4 MB limit, and the NFT cost $209 in transaction fees (although potentially just paid to itself).\n\nThe NFT took advantage of the same discount used by NFT project Ordinals when placing extra text in the Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 something that was mostly introduced by Segwit in 2017 (but has been largely associated with Taproot due to a widely read blog post on the topic).\n\n\"Behold, the Taproot Wizard, untethered and freed from his bondage!\" said Luxor on Twitter. \"He refuses to be censored, he refuses to be silenced.\"\n\nThe NFT comes amidst a debate in the Bitcoin community over whether these NFTs are a reasonable use of the blockchain, or if they are spam and should be discouraged, or even eliminated. Luxor appears to be making the case that these belong on Bitcoin.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nUdi's brainchild?\n\nDigging into the project a bit more, it seems to be some sort of a collaboration between the mining company and well-known crypto developer Udi Wertheimer. A dedicated Discord server has been set up for the project where Wertheimer outlined the dilemma facing the community.\n\n\"Will you join the Keepers and try to revive the Curse? Or will you join the Taproot Wizards and storm the Gates?\" he said in the server.\n\nWertheimer added that the project's followers should stay tuned with updates to be posted in the Discord server \u2014 suggesting this may not be a one-off. On Twitter, he tweeted the NFT transaction and said, \"we do a lil magic.\""

Discover SCENE\n\nWhat do eggplant emojis, porn, and video games have in common? They\u2019re all now permanently inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThis is probably not what Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind, but thanks to the Taproot upgrade and the controversial Ordinals project\u2014which lets people store unique assets on it, akin to NFTs\u2014you can now play an unofficial clone of the iconic 1993 first-person shooter Doom on the blockchain.\n\nCreated by Nicholas Carlini, the game is inscribed on Bitcoin as Inscription 466 and can be played with a keyboard and mouse. It\u2019s a simplistic knockoff of Doom and doesn\u2019t pack the gory, pixelated punch of the influential original, but it offers a taste of what\u2019s possible through Ordinals. An enhanced version has since been inscribed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd just like that a new version of DOOM with improved gameplay has dropped on the BTC blockchain.https://t.co/1nGRo5krYR h/t @grandfreud https://t.co/6jVqCUrFIG \u2014 Hector Lopez (@hlopez_) February 2, 2023\n\nIt also adds a new layer to the ever-expanding \u201cIt Runs Doom\u201d meme, in which people try to get the game working on nearly any gadget or device they can find\u2014whether it\u2019s an ATM, a fridge, a smartwatch, and plenty more. There\u2019s even a subreddit devoted to the pursuit, followed by over 94,000 Reddit users.\n\nSo does Bitcoin run Doom? For now, the answer is: sort of.\n\nBitcoin is the original decentralized and permissionless blockchain\u2014and the ability to store content on it makes it something of a unique historical record.\n\nThe Ordinal Theory Handbook argues that Bitcoin inscriptions like the Doom clone game are better than NFTs, which are unique blockchain tokens (typically ERC-721 tokens on Ethereum) that signify ownership over associated metadata that in many cases is stored off-chain in a centralized manner.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEvery inscription on Bitcoin through Ordinals is labeled a \u201cdigital artifact,\u201d because it is complete and decentralized in and of itself. It\u2019s immutable, unlike most NFTs, whose metadata can be modified or even deleted by the creator.\n\nSince its launch in January, Ordinals has already caused quite the stir among the Bitcoin community, as maximalists and devotees have debated whether any content should be uploaded to Bitcoin at all.\n\nAs one might expect from the crypto \u201cdegen\u201d community, much of what has been added to Bitcoin as inscriptions so far is something akin to digital graffiti. There are eggplant emojis and Bored Ape Yacht Club knockoffs, along with nudity, music, tweets, GIFs, Donald Trump memes, and even ads for the privacy chain Monero. Fun times."

Still, the mood in the market is as positive as it was back then.\n\nThat's the message from funding rates, a mechanism that keeps the prices of bitcoin perpetual futures contracts in sync with the spot market price. When perpetual futures are trading above spot, the funding rate is positive and holders of bullish long, or buy, positions pay bearish shorts to keep their trade open. The opposite happens when perpetuals trade below the spot price.\n\nAnalysts track the funding rate to gauge the mood of leverage traders. The higher the funding rate, the more excited traders are about price prospects and the more willing to pay a premium to keep their upside bets open.\n\nAs of Thursday, the annualized bitcoin perpetual funding rates across major exchanges including Binance was 8.491%, the highest since Dec. 3, 2021, according to data tracked by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.\n\nBack then, one bitcoin was priced around $57,000, or 2.5 times the current market rate of $23,400. The cryptocurrency set a record high of $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nThe funding rate flipped positive in mid-December last year, indicating seller exhaustion. The cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid at the turn of the year and has rallied over 40% since then.\n\n\"There has been a clear shift in market sentiment post-[December) CPI with funding rates well into positive territory and price volatility on the rise,\" Dessislava Laneva, a research analyst at Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko, said in a tweet referring to the U.S. consumer price index.\n\nThe CPI fell to 6.5% in December, the sixth straight monthly deceleration in price increases. The data convinced markets that the Federal Reserve was likely to pivot to liquidity-boosting interest rate cuts later this year.\n\nEarly this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the inflation picture and downplayed concerns of a severe tightening-induced economic slowdown, bolstering the pivot hopes.\n\nStory continues\n\nFocus on US nonfarm payrolls\n\nThe U.S. nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report scheduled for release at 13:30 UTC is likely to show the world's biggest economy added 185,000 jobs in January following December's 223,000 increase, according to Reuters estimates sourced from FXStreet.\n\nThe unemployment rate is forecast to tick slightly higher to 3.6% in January, while average hourly earnings, or wage growth, is expected to print at 4.9% year on year following December's 4.6% rise.\n\nA notable increase in average hourly earnings, a proxy for potential inflation, coupled with the headline jobs figure might see investors reconsider the possibility of the Fed keeping interest rates higher for longer and scale back bullish positioning in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\n"

Image: Ordinals\n\nOn Feb. 2, independent developer, Udi Wertheimer, tweeted he had conducted the \u201clargest transaction in Bitcoin\u2019s history\u201d after using the Ordinals protocol to inscribe a 3.94-megabyte image of a sunglass-wearing, bald, bearded wizard lauding \u201cmagic internet JPEGs.\u201d\n\nLast night, we made history\n\n\n\nThe gatekeepers tried to censor us\n\n\n\nBut we mined the LARGEST BLOCK and LARGEST TRANSACTION IN BITCOIN\u2019S HISTORY\n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to bitcoin full node operators for supporting our efforts and hosting our 4MB NFT for all eternity!\n\n\n\ngm @TaprootWizards \u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/uKGG918af8 \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) February 2, 2023\n\nThe data size of these inscribed transactions is much more than those typically conducted on the blockchain and, as a result, has driven up the fees associated with processing them.\n\nTypical Bitcoin transactions can cost a few cents to a few dollars, but Ordinals can cost tens of dollars in comparison.\n\nFigures from crypto-mining data provider Hashrate Index show over the past seven days, fees as a percentage of the block reward are on the rise, starting off the week at around 1% before jumping to a Feb. 1 weekly high of 6.74%.\n\nMastercard\u2019s NFT lead quits on bad terms, sells resignation letter as NFT\n\nThe now-former NFT product lead at payments giant Mastercard left the company in a spectacular fashion, publicly slamming the firm for purportedly mistreating him and offering up his resignation letter as an NFT.\n\nIn a Feb. 2 Twitter thread, Satvik Sethi claimed Mastercard cut his salary by 40% when he moved from New York City to London, claiming he \u201chad to work side jobs this past year to make ends meet.\u201d\n\nI have resigned from @Mastercard.\n\n\n\nFor the past year, I served as the \u2018NFT Product Lead.\u2019 I evangelized Web3 for Mastercard leadership & regional teams, as well as all our Fortune 500 clients & partners.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t easy but read on for why it was necessary, and what\u2019s next : pic.twitter.com/kqiavsSIW7 \u2014 Satvik Sethi (@sxtvik) February 2, 2023\n\nHe claimed that at times he would not receive his salary \u201cuntil I begged across the hierarchy for it.\u201d\n\nSethi also alleged he was the victim of harassment \u201ccaused by a series of mismanaged processes, miscommunication [and] internal inefficiency.\u201d\n\nHe asked his over 22,000 Twitter followers for their support by minting his resignation letter for 0.023 Ether (ETH), worth around $37.\n\n\u201c100% of this goes to survival,\u201d Sethi added as he will lose his British work visa and would \u201cbe based in India for the foreseeable future.\u201d A future airdrop of art for holders of the NFT was also promised by Sethi.\n\nAt the time of writing 53 NFTs of the letter, which Sethi titled \u201cNew Beginnings,\u201d had been minted.\n\nCointelegraph contacted Mastercard for comment regarding Sethi\u2019s allegations but did not immediately receive a response.\n\neBay eyes talent for its acquired NFT marketplace\n\nE-commerce player eBay is looking to hire several Web3-related roles for its United Kingdom-based NFT marketplace KnownOrigin, which it acquired in June 2022.\n\nJob postings by eBay on LinkedIn revealed it is hiring for positions in the U.K. and at its headquarters in California.\n\nAmong the roles are a Manchester-based head of community for KnownOrigin and a content designer and marketing campaign executive for the marketplace, amongst other positions.\n\nThe firm is also hiring two California-based positions for a crypto counsel. The job description says the role will see a \u201ccreative crypto attorney\u201d joining eBay\u2019s legal team to support its \u201cbusiness, product, compliance and technology teams in the Web3 space.\u201d\n\nOpenSea rolls out suite of tools for NFT creators\n\nNFT marketplace OpenSea released the next series of tools for its \u201cDrops\u201d feature, which is used to help creators launch NFT collections with OpenSea to benefit from its reach.\n\nIn a Feb. 2 Twitter thread, OpenSea said it had worked closely with 20 teams to \u201cbuild a best-in-class drops experience.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re excited to start rolling out the next phase ofDrops on OpenSeaa product we\u2019ve been working on for the past few months! https://t.co/rRydH289Vq \u2b07\ufe0f \u2014 OpenSea (@opensea) February 2, 2023\n\nThe next phase of the rollout includes giving creators tools to conduct multi-stage minting, smart contract deployment across multiple Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains and personalize web landing pages, among other features.\n\nThe tool will be \u201cgradually opening up\u201d to select creators \u201cover the coming weeks,\u201d according to OpenSea.\n\nIt will also add more features in the coming weeks before it\u2019s released to the public at large.\n\nOpenSea has experimented with its Drops feature by creating personalized pages for select collections, most notably, one was created for the debut collection by actor Sir Anthony Hopkins which ended up selling out in under 10 minutes.\n\nOther Nifty News:\n\nJapanese Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, said there are \u201cvarious possibilities for using Web3\u201d in the country. The government may use NFTs and decentralized autonomous organizations to promote its \u201cCool Japan\u201d strategy, aiming to show off the nation\u2019s tech and culture.\n\nCointelegraph spoke with industry professionals on preventing NFT thefts who advised users to take due diligence, revoke unnecessary permissions and segregate NFTs into different wallets, among other measures."

Read preview\n\nA New Jersey man has admitted he tried to hire a hitman for $20,000 in Bitcoin to kill a 14-year-old boy who was going to testify against him in a child-pornography case, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nJohn Michael Musbach, 31, from Haddonfield, New Jersey, pleaded guilty in federal court to hiring a hitman to carry out a murder, according to a release by the Department of Justice.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nMusbach first encountered the boy in the summer of 2015 when the boy was 13 years old and living in New York with his parents, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The complaint alleges that Musbach and the boy exchanged sexually explicit content with each other online, including videos of themselves masturbating.\n\nThe boy's parents found out and alerted the police, who started investigating Musbach, according to the complaint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors alleged in a court filing that police discovered Musbach had Google searched a variety of alarming queries, like \"child grooming law,\" \"death by chloroform,\" \"where to buy chloroform,\" \"how to buy a gun in NJ,\" and finally, searches on how to erase his search history.\n\nIn March of 2016, authorities arrested Musbach on child pornography charges, prosecutors said in the complaint.\n\nA few months after being arrested, Musbach then \"decided to have the victim killed so that the victim could not testify against him in the pending criminal case,\" the DOJ said in a statement released Thursday. The criminal complaint states that Musbach found a murder-for-hire website on the dark web and arranged to pay $20,000 worth of Bitcoin for the murder of the victim.\n\nThe murder-for-hire service advertised itself on its website, saying \"If you want to kill someone, or to beat the shit out of him, we are the right guys ... No undercover cops here. No risks of getting caught, because we are professional killers,\" according to the complaint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Musbach asked if 14 years old was too young for the hit, the site administrator said \"14 years old is acceptable,\" according to the complaint.\n\nAfter paying up $20,000 in Bitcoin, Musbach then repeatedly messaged the service asking when the hit would be carried out, prosecutors said.\n\nEventually, the site administrator revealed that the site was a scam and threatened to turn Musbach in to law enforcement if he didn't turn over more money, according to the DOJ.\n\nMusbach allegedly responded, \"is this a joke?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe boy was never harmed, and the site did eventually turn Musbach over to authorities, prosecutors said. Musbach pleaded guilty to the murder-for-hire charges in court on Thursday, according to the DOJ.\n\nMusbach's lawyer, Rocco C. Cipparone, told Insider in a statement, \"Mr. Musbach decided to put this matter behind him without a trial, and accepted his responsibility.\"\n\nMusbach faces up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced in June."

        "content": "Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has described fiat currency as being in serious \u201cjeopardy\u201d as an effective store of wealth but doesn\u2019t believe Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins will be the solution either.\n\nThe founder of hedge fund firm Bridgewater Associates explained on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box on Feb. 2 that the mass money printing of the United States dollar and other reserve currencies has him questioning whether they are forms of \u201ceffective money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in a world in which money as we know it is in jeopardy. We are printing too much, and it\u2019s not just the United States, it is all the reserve currencies.\u201d\n\nHowever, Dalio was quick to add his thoughts on whether Bitcoin was a potential solution, acknowledging that despite what it has accomplished in \u201c12 years,\u201d it is still too volatile to serve as money:\n\n\"It's not going to be an effective money. It's not an effective store holder of wealth. It's not an effective medium of exchange,\" he argued.\n\nHe also dismissed stablecoins as an effective form of money, as they are replica of state-backed fiat currency.\n\nInstead, Dalio proposed the creation of an \u201cinflation-linked coin\u201d that would serve to ensure consumers secure their buying power.\n\n\u201cThe closest thing to that is an inflation index bond, but if you created a coin that says OK this is buying power that I know I can save in and put my money in over a period of time and transact in anywhere, I think that would be a good coin,\u201d he said.\n\n\"#Bitcoin has no relation to anything. It's a tiny thing that gets disproportionate attention,\" says @RayDalio on #crypto. \"The value of $BTC is less than 1/3 of $MSFT stock. It's not an effective store of wealth. But we are in a world where money as we know it is in jeopardy.\" pic.twitter.com/Cc7o2TwkxG \u2014 Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) February 2, 2023\n\n\u201cSo I think you\u2019re going to see the development of coins that you haven\u2019t seen that probably will end up being attractive, viable coins. I don\u2019t think Bitcoin is it,\" he added.\n\nHowever, not everyone agreed with Dalio\u2019s take on Bitcoin and the viability of an inflation-linked coin.\n\nDigital asset manager Eric Weiss of Bitcoin for Family Officers was one, telling his 38,300 Twitter followers that such a coin could not exist:\n\n\u201cAccording to Ray, [Bitcoin] is very close to being the solution to the world\u2019s problems but it\u2019s too volatile. He's waiting for and vaguely describes a solution that doesn\u2019t and can\u2019t exist,\" said Weiss.\n\nARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood also had a different view of Bitcoin, referring to it as a defense against wealth confiscation in parts of the developing world:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m struck that the market is now leading the Fed,\u201d @ARKinvest Founder @CathieDWood says on bond market downtrends.https://t.co/DDNw4dbOPD pic.twitter.com/AAS0UWf0kh \u2014 Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) February 2, 2023\n\n\u201cThose populations need a fallback, an insurance policy like Bitcoin,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated: Crypto-friendly Ray Dalio steps back from Bridgewater\u2019s $150M fund\n\nDalio\u2019s latest views on Bitcoin come despite once having labeled it \u201cone hell of an invention\u201d that could serve as a viable inflation hedge. However, these remarks were made on Jan. 28, 2021 \u2014 before the current bear market took effect.\n\nThe billionaire investor has also previously recommended BTC should make up 1-2% of an investors portfolio on Jan. 6, 2022.\n\nAs an investment product, the hedge fund manager said back in May 2021 that he would rather buy BTC over bonds but stated a few months later that he still prefers gold.\n\nOn Oct. 4, Dalio stepped down as Bridgewater\u2019s co-chief investment officer, but he remained on board as a mentor."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nOrdinals, a controversial new project that lets users put NFT-like media assets on the Bitcoin blockchain, is seeing surging activity this week. On Thursday, Ordinals recorded its largest number of single-day mints\u2014but network fees are apparently growing as a result.\n\nMore than 1,000 total Bitcoin NFTs have been minted via Ordinals, according to public blockchain data curated by Dune, topping that total on Thursday as 420 new \u201cinscriptions\u201d were made on the blockchain. That\u2019s more than three times the amount of NFTs minted on Bitcoin via the process on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, Thursday also marked the highest average transaction fee on Bitcoin in more than a month, landing at $1.53 worth of BTC per data from YCharts. That\u2019s the highest it\u2019s been since December 27, 2022\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImage: Dune Analytics\n\nThe launch of Ordinals revived the heated and long-standing debate in the Bitcoin space about block sizes, legitimate transactions, and whether JPEGs and other media should be inscribed on the original blockchain. Thanks to the Taproot upgrade, Ordinals has allowed anything from knock-off Bored Apes to video games to be added to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nNFTs are digital assets that are provably unique and linked to digital (and sometimes even physical) content like artwork, movies, and music files, and they can prove ownership of an item or membership in an exclusive group.\n\nWhile blockchains like Ethereum and Solana are synonymous with NFTs, the practice of committing digital assets to a blockchain network has existed on Bitcoin since 2014, with projects like Counterparty and Stacks leading the way.\n\ntl;dr after digging into the Ordinals \"spam\" debacle: 1) This has been possible since SegWit\n\n2) Taproot didn't enable this, it just made it (very) slightly easier and cheaper\n\n3) Prepare for the FUD as proponents of Bitcoin's early ossification try to weaponize this w/o nuance \u2014 Seth For Privacy (@sethforprivacy) February 3, 2023\n\nRising transaction fees are an apparent side effect of adding NFTs to Bitcoin\u2019s mainnet. Bitcoin transaction fees are determined by the volume of data in the transaction and the speed at which the user wants their transaction completed. Users who want their transactions to go through during periods of high traffic can decide to pay more fees to push their transactions through.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn January 21, when Ordinals launched, Bitcoin transaction fees topped out at 2.10% as a percentage of the block reward for miners\u2014but on January 24, Bitcoin fees topped out at 3.44%, according to data from Hashrate Index. On Thursday, that figure reached 3.86%.\n\nA closer look at the Hashrate Index data shows that the percentage is spiking at times during the day, including to a mark of nearly 8% late Friday afternoon. However, the overall daily average has thus far landed at a much lower number amid the rise of Ordinals.\n\nThe increase in transaction fees has led some Bitcoin maximalists to call Ordinals an affront to the Bitcoin ethos. Others say the project allows the spamming of the decentralized network.\n\nWe can have NFTs and collectables on Bitcoin without spamming/attacking the network. Taproot actually makes this even easier; the \"tapscript\" could be a new kind that refers to a torrent magnet instead of a script, and the spend on-chain doesn't need to add any data. \u2014 @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) February 3, 2023\n\nIt's sentiment that Ordinals developer Casey Rodarmor does not share. He told Decrypt on Monday that Bitcoin blocks need to be full to give users a reason to pay more than the minimum fee.\n\n\u201cIf blocks are not full, then nobody has any reason to pay more than the minimum fee rate to have their transactions included in a block,\u201d he said. \u201cSo as a result, blocks must be full.\"\n\nHe further explained that while he's keen on full Bitcoin blocks, he does not support increasing the size of the blocks. \"I wouldn\u2019t advocate to raise the block size,\u201d he affirmed.\n\nEven so, Ordinals are apparently affecting how people use the Bitcoin network, which may only fuel the continuing debate around their value and use.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

During his stay, Draper also met the country\u2019s president Ranil Wickremesinghe, where he again made the case for Bitcoin adoption in Sri Lanka.\n\nSri Lanka, which marks the 75th anniversary of its independence from Great Britain this year, is engulfed in a major economic and political crisis that saw it default on more than $56 billion of foreign loans in 2022. The country is facing fuel and food shortages that lead to mass protests and forced former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign,\n\nSystemic corruption is believed to be one of the reasons for Sri Lanka\u2019s descent into chaos; however, those ruling the country today appear to be opposed to introducing Bitcoin as a possible solution.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2014, Draper bought 30,000 BTC\u2014then worth $19 million\u2014seized from the dark web drug marketplace Silk Road in an auction held by the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nThat same year, he predicted the price of Bitcoin would go to $10,000 in three years. Bitcoin went on to surpass $20,000 in 2017.\n\nHowever, not all of Draper's predictions have come to pass. In 2018, he argued that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by 2022; by November 2022, as the crypto space entered into a prolonged bear market, he \"extended\" his prediction by six months, claiming that \"by mid-2023, I'm expecting to see Bitcoin hit $250,000.\""

        "content": "On Wednesday, the crypto market received favorable news in form of the FOMC announcement and the price of Bitcoin eventually broke above $24,000. With the Fed turning dovish after being hawkish all through 2022, it has been a beacon for the crypto market to rally and the liquidations have ramped up as the market took advantage of this.\n\nCrypto Market Liquidations Cross $130 Million\n\nWith bitcoin\u2019s rally above $24,000, short traders have once again drawn the short stick and are getting brutalized in the market. As of Thursday morning, the volume of liquidations over the last 24 hours has quickly crossed $130 million.\n\nOver 47,000 traders have seen their positions liquidated with the market rally and as expected, the vast majority of these have been short traders. Data from Coinglass shows that 72.96% of all traders affected during this liquidation event were short traders.\n\nFurthermore, almost half of all liquidations took place on the Binance crypto exchange at 48.34%, while Bybit accounted for 19.37%, and OKX followed closely behind at 14.96%. Interestingly, the largest single liquidation took place on the Bybit exchange on the BTCUSD pair worth $1.69 million.\n\nLiquidations cross $130 million | Source: Coinglass\n\nBitcoin leads the pack with over 1,670 BTC liquidated worth $39.67 million. Ethereum saw 20,560 ETH liquidated with $34.31 million, as the price of ETH rocketed past $1,660. Aptos, Solana, and Optimism made the top 5 with liquidations of $6.10 million, $4.05 million, and $2.95 million, respectively.\n\nIn the last four hours though, there seems to be a turn in the trend with bitcoin\u2019s drop below $24,000. While short traders are still suffering the majority of liquidations (58.14%), long positions are catching up.\n\nWhat Happens If Bitcoin Keeps Growing?\n\nBitcoin has since retraced after climbing above $24,000 but the digital asset still maintains its bullish streak. This means that there is still a long runway for bitcoin and it could possibly climb back above $24,000 before the trading day is over.\n\nIf this happens, then the liquidations are expected to ramp up quickly. BTC\u2019s consolidation over the last few days had worked to sow doubt in the market, and short positions were opened during this time. The Fed\u2019s decision to only raise interest rates by 25 basis points has already instilled more trust in investors who are now more willing to take risks.\n\nBTC trending above $23,800 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nPresently, with BTC ranging above its 200-day moving average, $25,000 is more likely a point for the digital asset to end its rally before a major pullback.\n\nAt the time of this writing, bitcoin is still changing hands just below $24,000 at $23,800. Nevertheless, the digital asset is seeing gains of 3.39% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Coinmarketcap.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from Bitcoinist, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin price is still trending comfortably above the $23,000 level as it maintains its bullish trend. This has continued for a couple of weeks now, propelled forward by the newly adopted dovish stance of the United States Federal Reserve. However, not all investors have embraced this bullish trend as many still expect a decline in price for the digital asset.\n\nBitcoin Price Could Trade At $20,000 Soon\n\nAccording to the Price Estimates feature on Coinmarketcap, a good number of investors are expecting a bearish reversal for the bitcoin price. Price Estimates is a feature on the data aggregator website that allows individual users to put in their price expectations and then gives an estimate of all of the predictions.\n\nIn the current round of forecasts, the bearish sentiment surrounding the digital asset seems to be heightened as the median estimations came out to a price of $20,000. If this plays out, then the price of bitcoin could reach this level by the end of February according to the Price Estimates feature. It would also be a 14.69% drop from the current price.\n\nBTC price estimates puts it over 14% lower | Source: Coinmarketcap\n\nInterestingly, the bearish expectations are not just limited to the month of February alone but span over the next five months. The median of 8,053 votes came out to a price estimate of $19,500 for the month of March, $18,426 across 5,294 votes for the month of April, $17,6660 across 3,617 votes for the month of May, and $18,555 across 2,161 votes for the month June.\n\nOwe 34,000 votes have been collected in total by the Price Estimates feature and the estimation average came out to $20,203.57 across all of the votes. The median estimate was much worse at a price of $19,659.\n\nBTC price recovers above $23,500 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nBTC Price Still Shows Strong Fundamentals\n\nPresently, while there have been speculations that the current upward movement of bitcoin is a bull trap, the digital asset is still showing strong fundamentals which suggest the price may continue to rise. One of these is that cryptocurrency is still trading well above all important moving averages.\n\nThe digital asset has now established support right above $23,000 which means that the bulls are still well in control. The $24,000 may have been elusive but bitcoin still maintains enough momentum for a retest. In the last 24 hours, it has seen trading volumes above $29 billion. As long as the bulls can hold the bitcoin price above $23,000 going into the weekend, the possibility of a crash remains slim.\n\nBTC is currently trading at just Aviv $23,400 at the time of this writing. It is down 1.53% in the last 24 hours but is seeing gains of 2.08% in the last seven days.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from Forbes, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin short-term holder profit-taking has reached high levels not seen since the November of 2021.\n\nBitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Shot Up Recently\n\nAs pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a near-term top usually becomes more probable when this trend forms for BTC. The relevant indicator here is the \u201cSpent Output Profit Ratio\u201d (SOPR), which tells us whether the average Bitcoin investor is selling at a loss or at a profit right now.\n\nWhen the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the holders as a whole are realizing some profit on their selling currently. On the other hand, values below the threshold suggest the overall market is selling at some loss at the moment.\n\nNaturally, the indicator having a value exactly equal to 1 would suggest the average investor is just breaking even right now as the total amount of profits being realized in the market is equal to the losses currently.\n\nThe SOPR here covers the entire market, but the metric can also be modified to cover only certain segments of the market. One major part of the sector is made up of the \u201cshort-term holders\u201d (STH) which is a cohort that includes all investors that acquired their coins within the last 155 days.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) Bitcoin SOPR specifically for these STHs over the last several years:\n\nThe 30-day MA value of the metric seems to have seen some rise in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin STH SOPR had been below a value of 1 throughout the 2022 bear market, implying that these investors had been selling at a loss during this period.\n\nThe quant has also marked previous instances of such a trend with the green boxes in the BTC price chart. It looks like this trend was also observed during bearish periods of the past cycles.\n\nRecently, with the latest rally, the metric has sharply climbed and broken out of this zone, as its value is above 1 now. This suggests that there is more profit harvesting happening from this cohort than loss realization currently.\n\nThis makes sense as prices right now are significantly higher than they were during the last 155 days window, which is when the STHs would have bought their coins, so these holders must be in some decent profits currently.\n\nAs the rally has continued, the STHs seem to have rapidly ramped up their profit-taking as well, since the SOPR indicator for them has also continued to shoot up. The level of their profit realization is now comparable to that seen in November 2021, when Bitcoin set its all-time high.\n\nAs for what this current profit-taking may imply for BTC, the analyst explains, \u201cwhen retail starts to get euphoric, the probability of a near-term price top starts to increase.\u201d\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $23,800, up 3% in the last week.\n\nLooks like BTC has risen in the past day | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nOn Episode 4 of the CoinGeek Weekly Livestream, Kurt Wuckert Jr. talks to Darren Kellenschwiler, also known as Deggen on YouTube, about building on Bitcoin. Kellenschwiler is the Chief Technical Officer at Elas and the Developers Community Manager of the BSV Blockchain Association.\n\nOrdinals on BTC\n\nWuckert asks Kellenschwiler if he\u2019s up to speed on the Ordinals NFT situation on BTC. He says he is not and asks what it\u2019s all about.\n\nWuckert explains that a developer has created a protocol scheme to turn individual satoshis into non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\n\u201cIt has broken the internet,\u201d he says, noting that the whole point of the Bitcoin civil war was to prevent this sort of thing. However, this developer has figured out a way to put image-based NFTs on BTC, deeply upsetting the small-blocker maximalists who claim Bitcoin is under attack.\n\nKellenschwiler says he has been working on a token platform that, conceptually, will be very similar. It\u2019s called Buzzmint.\n\nUnlike BTC fanatics, BSVers have no problem with useful token platforms. He speaks about how easy it is to develop applications on Bitcoin now, thanks to indexing services like JungleBus. Services like this will allow people to focus on their businesses rather than running nodes, the two agree.\n\nKellenschwilers\u2019 Bitcoin story\n\nWuckert always asks guests what their Bitcoin story is, and so he urges Kellenschwiler to tell his.\n\n\u201c2013-ish,\u201d Kellenschwiler replies, remembering how he heard about it from an engineer friend in England. At first, he dismissed it as \u201cinternet POGs,\u201d but after growing interested in how economics and money work, he started day trading Bitcoin and ended up selling a business and putting all of his cash into it.\n\nEventually, Kellenschwiler started coding and tinkering with Bitcoin applications. He moved to London and began traveling to events. These days, he works for Elas and is developing applications related to Metanet, among other things.\n\nIn the immediate future, Kellenschwiler is excited to attend the London Blockchain Conference. He\u2019s also interested in creating BSV meetups in Austin, where he\u2019s currently based.\n\nOn LiteClient\n\nWuckert recalls the excitement when LiteClient was first announced. However, he feels there\u2019s a huge lack of clarity about what it is, who would run it, etc. He asks Kellenschwiler to clarify and explain his participation in creating it.\n\nThe main pushback is from developers who are so used to running full nodes that they\u2019re \u201creluctant to even consider that running a Merkle root is as secure as all of the data in the entire block,\u201d Kellenschwiler says. \u201cThat\u2019s the main concept people don\u2019t get.\u201d\n\nExchanges and wallet developers are particularly reluctant to accept it, but application developers are far ahead.\n\nWuckert recalls a conversation with Dr. Craig Wright in Oslo in which he explained that, when everyone runs nodes, this simply replaces the Byzantine Generals Problem, which proof-of-work solved for a \u201cByzantine soldiers problem.\u201d There are so many more of them, and it\u2019s much harder to coordinate them, Wuckert notes, recalling how he had a lightbulb moment when Dr. Wright said it.\n\nWhat\u2019s coming for LiteClient in the future? Kellenschwiler thinks it will change how transactions are broadcast to the network. At the moment, most app builders will use a merchant API, but these will soon be replaced by new apps that give extra features, such as guarantees of broadcast acceptance. Long-term, the future of LiteClient is IPv6, multicast, and much more. This will all make the Bitcoin economy more efficient.\n\nViewer questions and answers\n\nQ. Why are edges important when programming in Bitcoin?\n\n\u201cImagine the infrastructure that supports the internet at the moment,\u201d Kellenschwiler says, painting a picture of the massive server farms that hold it all together. In a Bitcoin-powered world with multicast and IPv6, this will move toward the edges. It\u2019s not like that now because it\u2019s difficult to monetize, whereas Bitcoin allows us to monetize every packet.\n\nQ. What\u2019s the latest on the COPA case? What cases will we see next?\n\nIt\u2019s in \u201csomething of a holding pattern,\u201d Wuckert says. He has heard that the Kleiman case will go back to judge Bruce Reinhart, who notoriously dislikes Dr. Wright, but he doesn\u2019t have any further information right now.\n\nWatch: London Blockchain Conference 2023 \u2013 Bringing government and enterprise onto the blockchain\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "BENGALURU \u2013 A billionaire cryptocurrency evangelist may have had a tougher reception than he expected when proposing widespread adoption of Bitcoin to a bankrupt country.\n\nSilicon Valley investor Tim Draper was in Sri Lanka to shoot an episode of his Meet The Drapers TV show with local entrepreneurs, and met President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday to proselytise the adoption of cryptocurrency. He journeyed to the central bank the next day with the same pitch \u2013 but embattled governor Nandalal Weerasinghe, who is still working to calm financial mayhem, was having none of it.\n\n\u201cI come to the central bank with decentralised currency,\u201d proclaimed Mr Draper, dressed in a Bitcoin tie for the meeting.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t accept,\u201d Mr Weerasinghe said.\n\nIt was a frostier response than Mr Draper had received in some other locations. The tiny island country of Palau in the Pacific made him the founding resident of its digital residency programme, for instance.\n\nFuel and food shortages in Sri Lanka stirred riots last year that forced the then president to flee the country and later resign. The debt-stricken nation is in talks with international creditors about debt restructuring, aiming to get the International Monetary Fund to come up with a rescue plan. Inflation stands at 54.2 per cent and last year, the economy contracted 8 per cent, Mr Weerasinghe said.\n\nTo crypto enthusiasts, that might seem like the perfect place for Bitcoin adoption. One of the main uses that people see for crypto is as a steady store of value not subject to changes in central bank or government policy. Mr Draper even cited El Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, in the meeting. But experiences like El Salvador\u2019s, which staved off default at the last minute in January, might serve as a cautionary tale more than anything.\n\nMr Draper, 64, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and early backer of companies such as Tesla, Baidu, Skype, Coinbase and Robinhood, made news in 2014 when he purchased seized Bitcoin at a United States Marshals Service auction. Bitcoin is hovering in the low US$20,000 region \u2014 but he sees the cryptocurrency reaching US$250,000 (S$328,000) in 2023.\n\nHe kept trying in the meeting with Mr Weerasinghe. \u201cDoes the administration have the guts to do it?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat is the advantage of having your own currency?\u201d\n\nFurther, Mr Draper said he was \u201ca little worried about you guys\u201d, and that the financial crisis provided a window of opportunity for a country \u201cknown as the corruption capital\u201d. Colombo could avert graft by keeping perfect records after adopting Bitcoin, he argued.\n\nMr Weerasinghe said other technologies could efficiently distribute financial services to foster inclusion and disburse electronic welfare payments, and noted that a country without its own currency could not have monetary policy independence.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to make the crisis worse by introducing Bitcoin,\u201d he said.

        "content": "What Is Bitcoin Prime?\n\nBitcoin Prime was created a few years ago when cryptocurrency traders realised the financial promise of Bitcoin.\n\nIt is said that the Bitcoin Prime algorithm uses artificial intelligence to power its automated trading robot, which places and executes Bitcoin transactions. The platform then scans several Bitcoin exchanges and shows you the best bargains, aiming to reduce your chance of making a loss.\n\nThe platform is in constant flux, continually improving its service for new and seasoned traders alike. As such, Bitcoin Prime gives you access to regulated Bitcoin brokers in your region.\n\nIf you have some idea about the art of buying and selling things, you should be able to get your head wrapped around the Bitcoin Prime concept. You purchase Bitcoin when the market price is low, and then you sell BTC when the price goes up again. Bitcoin Prime\u2019s AI is said to assist in this process, helping you potentially make a tidy passive income for a commission fee.\n\nBitcoin Prime Overview\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Robot Type: Bitcoin Robot \ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \u2705 Is It a Scam or Legit?

However, based on what we gathered from its official website, Bitcoin Prime was developed and is owned by a team of professional traders and software developers. These individuals reportedly have decades of experience in the financial market, indicating that they are keen on ensuring the robot is at its best performance.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin Prime owners stay abreast with the latest trends and developments in the cryptocurrency market to gain insights into the market performance. This is so that they can ensure the robot identifies trends with more profitability and enhances its capability in managing cryptocurrency trades. Plus, the bot\u2019s owners partner with regulated platforms, making it legit and safe to trade with.\n\nGetting Started With Bitcoin Prime\n\nGetting started with Bitcoin Prime is easy, and it will only take you a few minutes to have everything set up. Here is a brief overview of how to create a trading account and trade with Bitcoin Prime.\n\nRegister for a Trading Account\n\nAt the top right corner of the Bitcoin Prime page, there is a form to fill out to begin your account setup. This procedure takes less than five minutes to complete.\n\nDeposit Funds\n\nBitcoin Prime has a minimum deposit requirement of $250. To begin your cryptocurrency trading ventures, you will deposit these funds via its affiliated brokers who are believed to be highly regulated and safe.\n\nTrade\n\nIt's a no-brainer that Bitcoin Prime is a trading robot in the cryptocurrency space. Therefore, once you make your deposit and set up the robot, it will automatically start executing trades based on market conditions. With a 90% claimed win rate, your chances of tripling your capital are maximised.\n\nBitcoin Prime Markets, Assets, and Options\n\nWhat cryptocurrencies and products can you trade using Bitcoin Prime?\n\nThe Bitcoin Prime trading platform lets you trade Bitcoin and other altcoins, including Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, and Ripple. Simply put, you have access to more than 14 cryptocurrencies, all of which you can also trade as CFDs. Unfortunately, the robot doesn't have any other trading options/markets. For instance, if you also venture into stocks and forex, you may want to consider other automated platforms.\n\nRemember, Bitcoin Prime features are user-friendly. So whether you are a beginner with zero experience in the crypto market or an expert trader looking for a better trading bot, it is suitable for your trading needs.\n\nWhat leverage trading options are available with the Bitcoin Prime app?\n\nThe robot works with regulated brokers in the cryptocurrency industry to offer investors up to 3000:1 leverage to magnify small trades. The company states that its high leverage is the main factor in the high return rate they offer to small investors. So, how does Bitcoin Prime work? Well, with 3000:1 leverage, if you invest $250, you can potentially borrow $750k to make crypto investments. This is relatively high compared to other Bitcoin trading platforms.\n\nHowever, you should remember that leveraged trading presents a significant amount of additional risk if you are inexperienced. Therefore, we recommend only investing what you can afford while you are a beginner.\n\nWhat are the spreads?\n\nThe spreads on Bitcoin Prime will change depending on which broker you are dealing with. In addition, because the market is quite volatile, you can expect some fluctuation between the buying and selling price of Bitcoin.\n\nFees, Limits, and Payment Options on Bitcoin Prime\n\nHow much does Bitcoin Prime cost?\n\nNote that there are no other fees attached to Bitcoin Prime besides the minimum deposit requirement and the 2% commission on profits made. For instance, this robot has a free account and there are no sign-up or subscription fees. In addition, you do not need to buy the robot since it is free to download. However, you cannot trade using Bitcoin Prime trading system without making the required deposit. Luckily, the bot has deposit bonuses from time to time, so always be on the lookout for these to maximise your experience.\n\nWe understand that some cryptocurrency traders are budget-conscious and might be skeptical of taking the plunge without understanding the robot. Fortunately, Bitcoin Prime has a demo account besides the live version to test the robot and practise how to navigate the cryptocurrency market without spending your hard-earned money.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: 2% on profits earned \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: Up to 10 free withdrawals per calendar month \ud83d\udcb0 Software cost: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Subscription cost: Zero\n\nWhat are the payment methods accepted by Bitcoin Prime?\n\nBitcoin Prime trading platform offers numerous payment methods to make investments. These include:\n\nPayPal\n\nMastercard\n\nVisa\n\nAnd many others\n\nDoes Bitcoin Prime also charge fees and commissions?\n\nAs we have previously mentioned, you do not have to pay any fees to open your Bitcoin Prime account. In addition, you also do not have to pay any fees to make a deposit. Therefore, the only time you will ever have to give money to Bitcoin Prime is when you pay a commission from your trade profits.\n\nBitcoin Prime trade sizes and limits\n\nAs aforementioned, Bitcoin Prime requires all users to pay a minimum deposit of $250 when creating their account. This is also the minimum amount you can invest to trade Bitcoin. Additionally, Bitcoin Prime does not have a maximum limit on how much you can spend, though we recommend starting small to avoid falling into financial difficulty.\n\nBitcoin Prime Platform\n\nHow does Bitcoin Prime work?\n\nThe Bitcoin Prime platform is an easy-to-use auto trading system that allows investors to trade cryptocurrency and potentially earn passive income.\n\nInterestingly, it is one of few auto-trading systems in the market that claims to apply AI to exclusively trading BTC contracts for differences (CFDs).\n\nUtilising sophisticated technology, Bitcoin Prime\u2019s auto trading robots reportedly analyse the current Bitcoin market to find the best investments for their users. Then, trading robots will invest the funds deposited in your account, making purchases and selling cryptocurrency to potentially garner a profit.\n\nSaid to be using complex algorithms, the trading platform reportedly finds the best deals for investors and helps them get a foothold in the market. As you would expect, these trading bots can cover huge amounts of information much faster than manual methods. Furthermore, the system runs independently, which means you do not have to sit on the app for hours at a time to invest your money -- the AI will do it for you.\n\nWhat devices can I use the Bitcoin Prime app on?\n\nYou can use the Bitcoin Prime app on many devices, including:\n\nSmartphones\n\nTablets\n\nDesktop Browsers\n\nThe app is surprisingly straightforward and does not cost anything to download. However, you will have to deposit funds before you start making your trades. Luckily, Bitcoin Prime provides a demo account to help you figure out the finer details of the app without risking your money.\n\nCan I use Bitcoin Prime in my country?\n\nKeep in mind that the Bitcoin Prime platform is available in most countries that legalise cryptocurrency trading. Examples of countries where you can use Bitcoin Prime include the following.\n\nCountry Is Bitcoin Prime available?

Currently, there are ten languages available in the dropdown menu at the top of the Bitcoin Prime homepage. These include:\n\nEnglish\n\nFrench\n\nSpanish\n\nItalian\n\nHow easy is it to use the Bitcoin Prime app?\n\nThe Bitcoin Prime app is an easy-to-use auto-trading platform that is straightforward to navigate. When you sign up, you don\u2019t need to know much about the technical side of things because Bitcoin Prime provides a demo account to help new users find their feet on the trading platform. You also have access to a video tutorial, which will explain everything you need to know.\n\nBitcoin Prime uses AI technology to find you the best Bitcoin deals, making it both intuitive and passive. You don\u2019t need to do anything to make a potential profit.\n\nThat being said, you should be aware that robot trading is riskier than other platforms. If you want to remain in complete control over your investments, you may prefer to go somewhere else.\n\nHow much profit can you make using Bitcoin Prime?\n\nIt's a no-brainer that Bitcoin Prime is tailored to manage trades. However, traders are advised to always monitor their activities to remain in control. Also, have a budget and do not be money-driven if you want to succeed at trading. Remember, losses are inevitable, so plan carefully before beginning your ventures.\n\nSome traders claim that they make thousands of dollars daily trading with Bitcoin Prime. While this can be true, we couldn\u2019t find any information on Bitcoin Prime\u2019s website guaranteeing trades\u2019 success. The amount of profit you will earn depends on your trading strategy and the amount of capital you invest.\n\nIf you are a beginner, we advise you to start trading with small amounts to avoid risking losing all your capital in case a trade goes against your trading strategies. Also, keep in mind that the robot deducts 2% of your profits, and you will also report your earnings to the ATO for tax deductions.\n\nBitcoin Prime Key Features\n\nThere are many features on the Bitcoin Prime system that add to the overall experience and help you earn potential profits. These include:\n\nPayouts: The Bitcoin Prime trading platform has a reliable payout system, which offers transparency from the moment you make the investment until you receive your payment. The system uses software that ensures all calculations are wholly accurate and in line with the current market price. It uses commissions taken from account holders\u2019 profits to fund its system. In addition, it will only take a commission when you make a profit from your trades.\n\nEasy Withdrawal Process: If you are looking for an auto trading platform with speedy withdrawal processes, this is the one for you. Bitcoin Prime will usually process your withdrawal request within 24 hours.\n\nDemo Account: If you are unsure how to use the service, Bitcoin Prime has a helpful demo account that lets you explore the system without using your money. You can use this account until you feel comfortable investing actual funds into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nNews Trading: The trading algorithms featured on Bitcoin Prime also monitor the market news feed to stay ahead of the market. By doing so, the robot identifies news that could significantly affect the prices of cryptocurrencies and executes trades based on its findings. Note that using Bitcoin Prime in managing news-based trades can be beneficial since the robot moves faster than humans, thus allowing you to take advantage of most trading opportunities.\n\nBitcoin Prime Security and Regulation\n\nIs Bitcoin Prime legit?\n\nBitcoin Prime is legalised in most countries that allow Bitcoin trading. Moreover, information from its website claims that many individuals from diverse countries globally have signed up for an account with the robot. Remember, every country has its own financial market regulations, and the fact that individuals are trading with it is a good sign the robot is legit and accepted globally.\n\nIs Bitcoin Prime safe?\n\nAs mentioned above, Bitcoin Prime partners with regulated cryptocurrency brokers, ensuring the safety of your funds at all times. In addition, all account holders have to pass a know-your-customer (KYC) verification process to confirm their address and identity. This helps prevent any fraudulent activity on the trading platform. The site also uses SSL encryption with the aim of protecting your valuable information.\n\nAre my money and I protected?\n\nSince the Bitcoin Prime system doesn't store trading funds, you must be wondering whether your data is secured with the robot. Well, note that it is highly encrypted, and there is no history of it being hacked and traders\u2019 information accessed. Also, your email is safe, and based on reviews on Trustpilot, there are no complaints regarding traders\u2019 emails being hacked.\n\nIs Bitcoin Prime regulated?\n\nSome of the authorities regulating Bitcoin Prime's integrated brokers include Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC), Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), etc.\n\nDo I have to verify my account with Bitcoin Prime?\n\nYes, when you sign up with Bitcoin Prime, you are paired with a regulated broker who will then ask you for the relevant KYC documents and information to complete your account. KYC refers to documents that confirm your identity and address, such as photo ID and proof of address. This is an important part of the process as it helps keep the platform free from fraudulent activity.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Prime Work? Trading Strategies and Algorithms\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and there is no guarantee of successful trades in this market. However, the use of the robot maximises traders' potential since the trading bot is said to feature advanced trading strategies and algorithms. Let\u2019s analyse below how each trading strategy works to benefit your trades.\n\nIt uses superior technology to automate trades on behalf of cryptocurrency traders. This streamlines your activities and maximises your profitability. However, ensure you confirm the availability of your preferred asset before signing up for a trading account.\n\nArbitrage Trading\n\nTiming is everything when it comes to cryptocurrency trading.
