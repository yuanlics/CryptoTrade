        "title": "Why embracing Bitcoin would be a low-risk, high-reward strategy for Trump - Fortune",
        "content": "A central bank digital currency, or CBDC, was once an idea confined to water cooler conversations among economists. But last week, former President Donald Trump catapulted the CBDC controversy to the front of the campaign trail. At an event on Jan. 18, he promised supporters, \u201cAs your president, I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency. This would be a dangerous threat to freedom, and I will stop it from coming to America.\u201d The crowd roared.\n\nSo what is a CBDC? Why is Trump suddenly talking about it? And what does a digital dollar have to do with Bitcoin and the future of money?\n\nIn short, a CBDC is a digital dollar created by the federal government. This may sound benign at first. But effectively giving the government digital control over consumer bank accounts has profound implications for privacy and freedom.\n\nBoth the virtue and the vice of a CBDC is that it is a form of programmable money. The programmability of a CBDC could empower governments to micro-target stimulus packages and transmit money more efficiently. But it could also enable governments to manipulate how and where we spend our money, going so far as to turn it on and off.\n\nNowhere is the threat of a government-controlled digital currency more evident than in China, which was the first major economic power to launch a CBDC. China is currently exploring ways to exploit the \u201cprogrammable features\u201d of its CBDC, which will empower CCP bureaucrats to put an expiration date on money, restrict spending to certain sectors, and even tie it to a citizen\u2019s social credit score.\n\nIn China, a CBDC will enable the kind of central planning Karl Marx could have only dreamed of. It\u2019s no wonder then that Democrats and Republicans alike despise the idea. Having seen the social experiment going on in China, many have a legitimate fear that a CBDC would allow the federal government to control their money and track their spending. That\u2019s why nearly 75% of Americans are opposed to a government-backed digital dollar where such tracking would be possible, according to a recent survey from Cato.\n\nTrump appears to have intuited that a CBDC is the undiscovered third rail of American politics. And so, he is railing against it in hopes of galvanizing liberty-minded Republicans in the primary with an eye toward privacy-minded Democrats and independents in the general. With this strategy, Trump aims to contrast himself with President Joe Biden, who signed an executive order in March 2022 to place \u201curgency on research and development of a potential United States CBDC.\u201d Biden has failed to recognize just how controversial a CBDC would be with his own supporters\u2014a mistake Trump is keen to exploit.\n\nBy opposing a CBDC, Trump aims to tap into a new well of support, particularly among experienced voters weary of government overreach. But beneath that well is an even larger reservoir of political energy just waiting to be unleashed: the younger and more diverse Bitcoin vote.\n\nFor many, waking up to the dangers of a CBDC is the first step in embracing Bitcoin. That\u2019s because Bitcoin is anti-CBDC technology. While a CBDC is a form of programmable money that governments can manipulate, Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that no one controls\u2014one resistant to both central bank manipulation and government censorship.\n\nSo what does this all mean for the 2024 campaign? To shore up his anti-CBDC bona fides, the next logical step for Trump could be to embrace Bitcoin. This would not only cement his support among pro-privacy Americans, it would curry favor with the crypto vote, which is positioned to be one of the most consequential constituencies this November.\n\nIn 2020, the digital asset voter was all but non-existent. Bitcoin was just starting a historic bull run. Many Americans did not understand it yet, thought it was a \u201cscam,\u201d or had concerns regarding its relationship with the U.S. dollar.\n\nFast-forward to today: An eye-popping 52 million Americans own digital assets, including 18% of Republicans and 22% of Democrats. Coinbase reports that the population of owners is greater than the number of Americans who directly own stock or use rideshares each month. The owners tend to be younger and span ethnic and political demographics.\n\nIn light of this bourgeoning population, multiple presidential primary candidates have outlined policy agendas to protect the right to own Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. And premier financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity have just launched the first spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nIn sum, digital asset enthusiasts have become a political force to be reckoned with.\n\nJust last month, an alliance of industry-aligned super PACs announced that they had collectively raised $78 million. They aim to increase that total to $100 million this quarter to support pro-innovation candidates. On a grassroots level, voters who own digital assets are poised to play a powerful role as well, especially in key battleground states.\n\nConsider New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. According to a Morning Consult poll, 18% of voters across these four states own digital assets. And of these voters, 55% said they would be less likely to support a candidate who stands in the way of crypto values. Those values include a desire to build an ownership economy, coupled with a distrust of the current economic system run by government agencies and large financial institutions.\n\nIn other words, these issues are top priorities for up to 1.9 million voters across these four swing states alone. In states that were decided by just thousands of votes in 2020, this new coalition of digital asset diehards could be enough to swing the election.\n\nThe question is, does Trump care?\n\nWhile he\u2019s been critical of digital assets in the past, there is growing evidence that he is changing his tune. Before raising the alarm on the dangers of CBDCs, Trump dipped his toes into crypto by raising millions of dollars through the launch of his own NFT collection.\n\nTrump has already embraced crypto to gin up support among voters\u2014and he could do so again by espousing a pro-Bitcoin agenda. In so doing, he could win converts among a voting group that the Biden administration has been openly hostile to. And he could gain instant access to millions of new voters and tens of millions of dollars in financial backing from heavyweight Super PACs.\n\nHerein lies the beauty of embracing Bitcoin: As a financial investment, it has historically been viewed as high-risk, high-reward. As a political gambit, however, it is low-risk, high-reward. Much like opposing a CBDC, supporting the right to own Bitcoin and crypto is a dealmaker for millions of Americans and a dealbreaker for almost none. And if anyone can recognize a good deal, it\u2019s Donald Trump.\n\nBrian Morgenstern is head of public policy at Riot Platforms, Inc., one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining enterprises in North America. He was a senior advisor and deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury from 2017 to 2020 and from 2020 to 2021 served as White House deputy press secretary and deputy communications director in the Trump administration.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nFutures traders have jumped on the arrival of the first US spot bitcoin exchange traded funds, ramping up a lucrative bet that capitalises on the volatile moves of crypto-related prices.\n\nThe number of bitcoin futures contracts open at Chicago\u2019s CME Group has climbed to record levels in January as traders target a short-term return from the difference between those contracts and the spot price \u2014 aping a strategy that has long been popular in more established financial and commodity markets.\n\nThe open interest marker, a sign of the depth and liquidity of a futures market, has enabled CME to leapfrog Binance as the world\u2019s largest exchange for trading derivatives of bitcoin. While Binance has thousands of retail customers, CME has traditionally catered to big asset managers, hedge funds and proprietary traders.\n\nAverage open interest at CME has hit 24,100 contracts this month, equivalent to about $4.6bn, up from 16,500 contracts for 2023. It climbed as high as 27,000 contracts, around $6bn, on January 12, the day US regulators approved the 10 new bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAn average of 66,000 bitcoin futures contracts at CME changed hands daily in January, representing a nearly 50 per cent jump month on month and surpassing their previous high in November 2022.\n\nTraders say volumes have been boosted by applying a tried and tested strategy in other markets, known as a \u201ccash and carry trade\u201d, to bitcoin.\n\nA trader can sell the future, which typically trades at a premium, and hedge it by buying the underlying asset. A spot bitcoin ETF also offers traders a cheaper and safer way to buy the cryptocurrency. The two prices typically converge as the futures contract nears expiry; traders say the trade generates up to a 15 per cent annualised return for little risk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple carry trade and we know this stuff in Chicago,\u201d said a longtime trader who declined to be identified. \u201cBitcoin presents a real opportunity for traders that understand forward curves to come in and provide liquidity and also take opportunistic positions.\u201d\n\nThe much-hyped launch of these stock market funds that invest directly in bitcoin had been expected to attract a new class of institutional investors to the world\u2019s most-traded cryptocurrency, further boosting its price. In fact, bitcoin has fallen sharply since the approval two weeks ago.\n\nHowever, the surging futures interest indicates the participation of a class of traders who care less about the markets\u2019 overall direction, and are instead focused on the arbitrage opportunities between bitcoin and its various derivatives.\n\n\u201cIn essence, this surge in activity indicates a substantial demand for Bitcoin exposure among institutional investors, an unprecedented development in the market,\u201d said Amberdata, a crypto derivatives trading research group, in a report last week.\n\nNikolaos Panigirtzoglou, an analyst at JPMorgan, said the arrival of spot bitcoin ETF was \u201clikely to induce a significant change in the bitcoin market structure.\u201d\n\nHe noted that onshore crypto exchanges and the CME have benefitted from US regulators\u2019 crackdown on offshore exchanges like Binance. The shift \u201cechoes the price discovery that is taking place in the traditional financial system, in particular in equities where ETFs are more prevalent,\u201d he said.\n\nDerivatives traders are also linking more of their strategies to the new bitcoin ETFs, particularly in the under-developed options markets, which allow wagers on swings in the price.\n\n\u201cThe most exciting aspect of a spot Bitcoin ETF lies in its potential to significantly expand the nascent crypto volatility market,\u201d Amberdata said."

        "content": "Bitcoin Could Crash to $30K, According to VC and Ex-ARK Crypto Head Burniske\n\nChris Burniske, partner at venture capital firm Placeholder and former crypto lead at ARK Invest, has suggested that Bitcoin (BTC) could experience further declines before finding a local bottom.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Friday, Burniske attributed the potential dip to factors related to \"macro adoption\" and \"new product development.\" He projected that BTC could drop to at least $30,000-$36,000 before reaching a local bottom and expressed the possibility of testing the mid-to-high $20,000 range.\n\nDespite the near-term bearish outlook, Burniske remained optimistic about Bitcoin's long-term prospects, asserting that it would eventually reach new all-time highs. He emphasized the importance of patience for investors, acknowledging that the path to recovery will be volatile.\n\nArthuer Hayes\u2019 recent posts also reflect the same sentiments as Burniske. The BitMEX founder posted that Bitcoin could dip to $30,000 to $35,000 due to a \u201cTradFi mini-financial crisis.\u201d\n\nBurniske's comments come amid a recent dip in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin losing significant value after briefly approaching $49,000. Despite starting 2023 below $17,000 and ending the year above $42,000, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain its momentum following the approval and trading of ETFs on Wall Street. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $42,083, still significantly below its all-time high of $69,044 reached in November 2021."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs Are Here. Why You Should Buy and Hold Long Term - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "On Jan. 10, the SEC finally approved the first-ever spot Bitcoin (BTC -4.28%) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). For good reason, they have been called the most important new product Wall Street has created in nearly 30 years. That's because these ETFs make the process of buying and selling Bitcoin so simple that practically anyone can do it.\n\nAs a result, the new Bitcoin ETFs could change the world of crypto investing forever. But there's one thing that they will not change: The need for a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy when investing in Bitcoin.\n\nCapture Bitcoin's long-term price performance\n\nWhile there are undoubtedly some investors who will actively trade these ETFs, or who will use them as part of sophisticated portfolio hedging strategies, they are designed primarily for only one purpose: To get passive exposure to the long-run price potential of Bitcoin.\n\nSince the new ETFs are backed by Bitcoin itself (and not by derivatives contracts attempting to replicate the performance of Bitcoin), they should offer a nearly 1:1 match with Bitcoin's performance. Unlike most other ETFs, which typically hold a very diversified basket of stocks, these new ETFs will only hold Bitcoin. So if Bitcoin goes up by 150% in one year (as it did in 2023), then your new ETF should also go up by 150% in the same year.\n\nThis ability to capture the long-term price performance of Bitcoin is very attractive, because just about everyone agrees that the price of Bitcoin has the potential to skyrocket higher. Bitcoin could soon eclipse its all-time high of $69,000 before breaking through the $100,000 level by the end of 2024. And you can easily find price predictions for Bitcoin well in excess of $100,000. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, for example, thinks that the price of Bitcoin could top $1.5 million by the year 2030.\n\nBut the only way you will be able to capture the full long-term price performance is by buying and holding. If you are constantly moving in and out of the market, you will likely end up losing out on some of Bitcoin's gains.\n\nMinimize your total cost of ownership\n\nThat brings us to another key aspect of the new Bitcoin ETFs: They are designed to minimize your total cost of ownership. In a race to acquire as much investor money as possible as quickly as possible, the new Bitcoin ETF offerings often come with extraordinarily low expense ratios.\n\nIn some cases, the fees are as low as 0.20% per year. The fees are so modest, in fact, that some analysts have speculated that the big Wall Street firms may not make any money on them at all. (But don't worry, they'll find other ways to make the money back from you!)\n\nIf you are thinking about getting exposure to Bitcoin, there is only one calculation that you need to make. Simply add up the total costs of buying Bitcoin directly on a cryptocurrency exchange such as Coinbase Global (COIN -7.17%), and then compare it to the super-low cost of owning the new ETFs. Unless Coinbase decides to lower its trading fees, it will almost always make sense to go with the lower-priced ETFs. At a near-zero cost, you can add Bitcoin to your portfolio.\n\nThat's why it doesn't seem to make sense to embrace a short-term trading strategy for Bitcoin. You'll be missing out on the cost advantages of the new Bitcoin ETFs and unnecessarily driving up your total cost of ownership. Not to mention the fact that you will likely be missing out on the inherent tax efficiencies of the ETF investment product.\n\nTake the emotion out of crypto investing\n\nFinally, there's something to be said for taking the emotion out of investing. Crypto investing, in particular, is known for its sharp swings up and down. The daily volatility can be jarring if you are new to crypto. And it can be very confusing to determine why a particular crypto is trading up or down at a particular moment.\n\nThat's why a buy-and-hold strategy can make so much sense. You can sit back and ignore the day-to-day volatility, confident that your ETF will ultimately trend higher over a long-enough time horizon. That's why many experienced Bitcoin investors have always preached a HODL (crypto slang for \"hold\") strategy: It's the best way to capture the long-term uptrend in the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin for the long haul\n\nFor most investors, the new Bitcoin ETFs are likely the most efficient way to capture the long-term price potential of Bitcoin. They are a low-cost investment vehicle that takes away the need to monitor the performance of Bitcoin on a daily basis. So if you're going to buy one of the new Bitcoin ETFs, you should plan to buy and hold for the long term."

        "content": "For months, Wall Street investors had been predicting that the price of Bitcoin (BTC -4.22%) would soar as soon as the SEC finally approved the new spot-price Bitcoin ETFs. But this didn't happen. In fact, quite the opposite. The price of Bitcoin is now down to $40,000, and concerns are growing that it could dip even lower.\n\nThis is all probably a bit jarring, especially for the first-time crypto investor who expected to become a Bitcoin millionaire overnight. But it's actually part of a pattern we've seen over and over again with Bitcoin, and there's no need to panic now. Let's take a closer look.\n\nBitcoin and tactical asset allocation\n\nThere's been intense media coverage of the new spot-price Bitcoin ETFs, as well as an exhaustive list of possible reasons the price of Bitcoin has dipped in the aftermath of SEC approval. One possible explanation is related to the concept of tactical asset allocation, which simply refers to the process of reallocating funds among different asset classes to take advantage of short-term market situations.\n\nIn layman's terms, this simply means that money is being shuffled around among different Bitcoin investment products as people search for the best way to get exposure to Bitcoin. The process of doing this, unfortunately, is causing downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nKeep in mind that people have different options when they want to buy Bitcoin now. They can invest in Bitcoin proxy stocks (such as Bitcoin mining companies). They can invest in Bitcoin futures contracts. They can buy futures-based Bitcoin ETFs. They can buy Bitcoin directly in the spot market via a cryptocurrency exchange. And they can invest in the new spot-price Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nFor the Bitcoin tactical asset allocation thesis to make sense, you would expect to see certain things. You would expect to see people selling off Bitcoin proxy stocks as they look for more direct exposure via the spot-price Bitcoin ETFs. This has happened. You would expect to see people moving out of the higher-cost futures Bitcoin ETFs into the lower-cost spot-price Bitcoin ETFs. This has happened. And you would expect Bitcoin trading volume on crypto exchanges to fall as people instead buy ETFs. This, too, appears to be happening.\n\nFrom my perspective, this explanation makes a lot of sense if you assume most investors are rational as they search for the best way to invest in a certain asset. Moreover, I find this explanation strangely comforting, because it means that nothing has changed in the grand macro thesis of Bitcoin adoption. It means that there has been no major change in the long-term growth prospects of Bitcoin. The only downside, really, is that less \"new\" money might be flowing into Bitcoin than we expected. Instead, it's just \"recycled\" money from other Bitcoin products.\n\nHistorical evidence from Bitcoin\n\nStill not convinced? Well, let's consider the historical evidence from Bitcoin and similar types of product launches.\n\nOne of the best graphics that I've seen over the past two weeks appeared on CNBC. As Markus Thielen of 10x Research pointed out, the same pattern has occurred with every major launch of Bitcoin-related financial products. A lot of early hype leads to a surge in the price of Bitcoin, followed by a swift downward correction on the actual news.\n\nThis happened with the first Bitcoin futures contracts, which launched in December 2017. It happened with the April 2021 initial public offering (IPO) of crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN -7.17%), which brought Bitcoin trading to the average investor. It happened with the launch of the Bitcoin futures ETFs in October 2021. And it is now happening with the launch of the new spot-price Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. If you take a trading chart of Bitcoin and highlight these dates, the trend is unmistakable. Peaks follow listings, with dips in their wake. And the long-term price gains continue after a pause.\n\nWhile you could argue that correlation does not imply causation, there does appear to be a strong pattern here, right? It suggests that as soon as there is a new way of investing in Bitcoin, people start reallocating their Bitcoin funds, and that causes a short-term price downturn.\n\nBuy the dip on Bitcoin\n\nLong story short: You should buy the dip. Bitcoin under $40,000 is a no-brainer investment opportunity in my eyes. By my analysis, there is simply no way that a sustained surge in new retail and institutional money into Bitcoin won't help to prop up its price. And if many investors decide to allocate just 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin, that's going to provide long-term price support -- and it's easier than ever to do it thanks to the new spot-price ETFs.\n\nThat's why I'm still strongly bullish on Bitcoin. The process of democratizing crypto for the average investor continues, and the spot-price Bitcoin ETFs are a welcome new addition. Yes, it's been messy for the past two weeks, but I'm more convinced than ever that investors need to hold Bitcoin for the long term and learn to embrace its volatility."

Since January 19, ARK Invest has sold a total of 2,226,191 shares of BITO, worth approximately $45.2 million as of Friday\u2019s market close, from its Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).\n\nConcurrently, it has accumulated its own spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the ARK 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), which was launched on January 11. So far, it has purchased 1,563,619 shares of ARKB, valued at roughly $65.7 million. ARKW now holds $91.5 million worth of ARKB, representing a 5.98% weighting of the fund's total value. In contrast, its BITO shares have dwindled to just 366,128, valued at $7 million, constituting a mere 0.46% weighting.\n\nARK Invest's divestment from BITO is consistent with its earlier strategy of holding BITO as a short-term play in anticipation of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. The firm had previously sold its shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) late last year, expecting to replace BITO with a spot Bitcoin ETF once it became available.\n\nARK Invest recently sold $5.2 million worth of Coinbase shares (COIN) after the US-based crypto exchange surged in anticipation of the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Coinbase is named as the custodian of numerous spot ETF issuers. However, Cathie Wood remains bullish on the Bitcoin and crypto sector, famously calling a Bitcoin price target of $1.5 million by 2030."

        "title": "Crypto may have become boring, but it still isn't legit - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nIt was easy to poke fun at crypto back in late 2022. The market had tanked by about two-thirds in the space of a year; many of the industry\u2019s biggest companies and coins had collapsed into oblivion, their flagrant practices exposed; and the bubble that had driven receipts for pixelated images of apes (remember NFTs?) to sell for millions of dollars had burst. Longtime critics like me were being encouraged to take virtual victory laps, while the crypto crew had egg, clearly, all over their laser-eyed faces.\n\nJust over a year later, however, poking fun might seem less straightforward. Crypto prices have recovered significantly, with the market valuation having roughly doubled over the past twelve months. Earlier this month, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the listing of 11 spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs), giving investors exposure to the cryptocurrency via regulated products that can be bought and sold like stocks, and are issued by some of the best-established asset managers. Meanwhile, Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world and one of those offering a bitcoin ETF, has become something of bitcoin evangelist, calling it \u201can asset class that protects you\u201d.\n\nIs it time for the likes of me to admit we were wrong? Was the approval of the ETFs a game-changer? Is crypto now kind of . . . legit?\n\nThe hyperbole has come in thick and fast, certainly. \u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable to suggest that [the SEC\u2019s approval] may be the biggest development on Wall Street in 30 years,\u201d Michael Saylor, executive chair of software-company-turned-crypto hoarder MicroStrategy, told Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThe significance of this moment cannot be overstated,\u201d gushed Brad Garlinghouse, chief executive of crypto firm Ripple on X. \u201cToday\u2019s news is further legitimisation of crypto as an asset class,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAnd yet despite these lofty proclamations, and the fact that this was heralded as a landmark event by both the crypto and mainstream press, what has happened is distinctly dull. The only tiny glimmer of excitement came when the SEC\u2019s X account was compromised, meaning the ETFs\u2019 approval was announced ahead of time. We haven\u2019t suddenly found out the true identity of bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto. There is no newfangled initialised asset class on offer that can magic up money out of thin air (before NFTs, you might remember ICOs, STOs, and IEOs).\n\nNo, all that happened is that crypto has gone from being an exciting and rebellious alternative to traditional finance, a way of \u201cbeing your own bank\u201d, to simply providing a means for regular investors to diversify their portfolios and for asset managers to eke out a bit of extra revenue.\n\nCrypto in 2024 is, in other words, rather boring. But boring does not equal legitimate, as SEC chair Gary Gensler himself pointed out when the announcement was made. The commission\u2019s approval of the bitcoin ETFs was not an endorsement of bitcoin or crypto more widely, but rather the result of a court ruling that found the SEC\u2019s long-standing opposition to bitcoin ETFs \u2014 on the grounds they could be subject to fraud and manipulation \u2014 was arbitrary.\n\nIn a statement, Gensler said that \u201cthough we\u2019re merit neutral, I\u2019d note that . . . bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing\u201d.\n\nFor context, some of the other ETFs that have been approved by the SEC include the \u201cGod Bless America\u201d ETF (ticker: \u201c$YALL\u201d), an anti-woke \u201cinvestment for God-fearing, flag-saving conservatives\u201d; the \u201cInverse Cramer\u201d ETF (SJIM) that aims to invest in the opposite of whatever TV personality Jim Cramer recommends; and a \u201cVICE\u201d ETF (VICE) that invests in \u201cvice-related business activities\u201d.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s not as if boring crypto is all there is now. For anyone who feels bereft of the non-boring variety, there is still plenty of that. For instance, the online pastor charged with civil fraud earlier this month after he and his wife created and sold a cryptocurrency to Christians, telling them God had told him directly they would get rich if they bought it. He has since said it\u2019s possible he \u201cmisheard God\u201d, and has also defended himself by saying that although it\u2019s true that he and his wife pocketed $1.3mn, some of that was spent on a \u201chome remodel that the Lord told us to do\u201d.\n\nThe truth is that, whether the crypto is encased in a nice regulated wrapper and sold to you by BlackRock, or whether you buy it from a pastor who says that the Lord told him to make the sale, there is still no there there. So while it might be more difficult these days, I will continue doing what I consider to be God\u2019s real work: taking the mickey out of it.\n\njemima.kelly@ft.com"

        "title": "1 Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Before It Soars More Than 3,000%, According to This Wall Street CEO - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In the wake of the landmark approval of 11 Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Cathie Wood, chief executive officer of Ark Invest, once again made headlines with her ambitious price target for Bitcoin (BTC -4.22%).\n\nDoubling down on her claim that Bitcoin could soar to a price of $1.5 million by 2030, Wood emphasized in an interview with CNBC that the approval of the ETFs only increases the chances of the cryptocurrency reaching her lofty estimates.\n\nHer remarks might seem overly optimistic, but they aren't baseless. Citing multiple factors from her firm's annual Big Ideas report, the case for a seven-figure Bitcoin isn't as crazy it seems. Here's why Wood and her team think its future is so bright.\n\nThe institutions are knocking on Bitcoin's door\n\nFor years, there was anticipation that deep-pocketed institutional investors would enter the Bitcoin market. Aside from a few companies adding the cryptocurrency to balance sheets, this assumption remained nothing more than speculation. But with the launch of several new Bitcoin ETFs, this all changes.\n\nWithout the ETFs, there were simply too many barriers discouraging companies from holding Bitcoin. Complications related to the intricacies of compliance, procurement, and general legalities all posed significant obstacles.\n\nBut now, as Wood sees it, a legitimate tipping point of institutional adoption is here. With several Bitcoin ETFs trading on the stock market, there is an accessible and easy on-ramp for exposure. With increased access, the crypto's finite supply will come under even greater pressure.\n\nMore so than any other development, Wood and her team believe institutional adoption will be the single greatest catalyst for price appreciation as Wall Street's biggest names accept Bitcoin as the leader among a burgeoning asset class.\n\nThese traditional financial juggernauts have significant capital at their disposal -- literally trillions of dollars. Should just 1% trickle into Bitcoin, Wood says it will result in enormous price appreciation for it.\n\nA flight to quality\n\nWhile this is all still evolving, Wood and her team expect the market will move to more resilient and durable assets like Bitcoin in a flight to quality. Performance lapses and a lack of stability in existing financial structures are becoming more evident, and Bitcoin will benefit from this due to its decentralized and secure nature.\n\nAn example of this was seen in the banking crisis of 2023. Over the course of five days in March 2023, several midsize U.S. banks failed. In the wake of these collapses, Bitcoin surged more than 35% as investors flocked to the cryptocurrency as a way to mitigate contagion from trickling into portfolios.\n\nAnother example is persistent inflation. Wood thinks that as fiat currencies around the world continue to be debased, Bitcoin's role as a way to preserve purchasing power will gain credence. For decades, investors had no other option than to play the game of government-backed currencies, but now things have changed.\n\nBorn out of the Great Recession, Bitcoin returns financial sovereignty to individuals rather than entrusting it to banks or governments engaging in risky and irresponsible financial practices. As this realization becomes clearer, Wood foresees Bitcoin's prominence as a safe haven gaining credence in the coming years.\n\nHere for the long haul\n\nLast but not least is the continued expansion and resilience of Bitcoin's blockchain. Consider that for the past 15 years, the crypto has operated without a single entity overseeing its day-to-day functioning, without skipping a beat. It is an accomplishment nothing short of remarkable. Even better, though, it is growing stronger and more capable by the day.\n\nWood pointed out a handful of metrics that back up just how impressive this feat is. Take transactions, for example. Bitcoin is currently closing in on its one-billionth transaction. And in 2023, the network facilitated more transactions than Visa.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Bitcoin's security continues to increase. Its hash rate, a metric that measures computing power, is currently at an all-time high and has been on an upward trajectory for most of its existence. Today, Bitcoin is estimated to be 500 times more powerful than the world's most advanced supercomputer.\n\nHow Bitcoin hits the seven-figure mark\n\nEach of these aspects individually hold the potential to add to Bitcoin's journey of price appreciation. But Wood says a confluence of forces could produce an effect that is orders of magnitude larger than anything in Bitcoin's history.\n\nThe approval of the Bitcoin ETFs was just the first domino to fall and should kick off a series of catalysts over the coming years. With Wall Street's acceptance of the cryptocurrency, Wood says that it will take center stage among the financial and political elites. Naturally, general interest from the public will likely grow, and recognition of the crypto's unique qualities will become more common.\n\nAdd it all up, and you have Cathie Wood's expectation that we are witnessing something akin to the early days of the internet. Considering just how influential and monumental the internet proved to be, a $1.5 million Bitcoin doesn't sound like such a long shot."

        "content": "In short, an overbought market after months of increasing certainty about the SEC\u2019s Bitcoin ETF approvals burst in January and allowed the price to correct some.\n\nHistorical #Bitcoin prices for today, January 26th: 2024 \u2013 $41,174\n\n2023 \u2013 $23,016\n\n2022 \u2013 $36,800\n\n2021 \u2013 $32,502\n\n2020 \u2013 $8,608\n\n2019 \u2013 $3,571\n\n2018 \u2013 $11,118\n\n2017 \u2013 $916\n\n2016 \u2013 $390\n\n2015 \u2013 $269\n\n2014 \u2013 $1,007\n\n2013 \u2013 $18\n\n2012 \u2013 $5.3\n\n2011 \u2013 $0.40 \u2014 Historical Bitcoin Price (@HistoryBTCPrice) January 26, 2024\n\nDuring this time, short-term traders helped pump the price, then went ahead and took profits after the Bitcoin ETF approvals by \u201cselling the news.\u201d\n\nFinally, tougher macro conditions, with a stronger dollar after a months-long slump, have led to more bearish sentiment for Bitcoin\u2019s overall outlook in January.\n\nHere are some more details:\n\nOverbought Market On Bitcoin ETF News\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry was ecstatic after a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Grayscale last August. The crypto hedge fund\u2019s lawsuit alleged that the SEC\u2019s decision to reject its Bitcoin ETF proposal was arbitrary and capricious.\n\nThe judge ordered the SEC to make a good-faith effort to approve an ETF. After that, Bitcoin price really began to heat up in October.\n\nWeek after week of new headlines with updates about the progress between over a dozen ETF applicants and the SEC kept pushing Bitcoin higher. The average exchange rate on crypto exchanges soared 80% in just a little over four months from $25,811 on Sept. 1 to $46,670 on Jan. 10. The average annualized ROI for that would be well over 200%. As JP Morgan predicted, the price had to cool.\n\nProfit Taking By Short-Term Bitcoin Price Traders\n\nSome Bitcoin investors follow a long-term strategy of accumulating and holding without selling. They are highly convinced that the upside left in cryptocurrency\u2019s global adoption curve is tremendous, and they are loathe to sell any of their holdings. But price arbitrage day traders were apt to take profits in January.\n\nAntoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo, says the falling Bitcoin price in January was an example of the \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d phenomenon in exchange markets for liquid assets. A Motley Fool report says, \u201cIt seems like some short-term traders bid up the digital currency\u2019s price in anticipation of the recent ETF approvals and then quickly took profits as the euphoria faded.\u201d\n\nTougher Macro Conditions, Bearish Sentiment\n\n\u201cOver the past two weeks, Bitcoin has been challenged by tougher macro conditions \u2014 evidenced by rallying rates and a strengthening dollar,\u201d wrote Sean Farrell, head of digital-asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC, in a recent note.\n\nAs analysts for crypto exchange Bitfinex wrote in a note Tuesday, Bitcoin price fell in January because \u201cbearish sentiment appears to be prevailing.\u201d They expect key support levels at $38,000 and $36,000 if the correction continues, although Friday\u2019s 5% rally could mean a recovery is afoot."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been gradually moving up during the weekend, indicating continued demand from the bulls. Data shared by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on Jan. 26 shows that BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) assets under management crossed the $2 billion mark.\n\nSolid buying at lower levels arrested the decline in Bitcoin, but a new bull market is unlikely to start in a hurry. Bitcoin may consolidate its gains as traders focus on the inflows into the newly launched Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and wait for the Bitcoin halving in April.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nIf Bitcoin enters a range, it will be a positive sign as it shows that traders are not hurrying to book profits because they anticipate the uptrend to continue. That may also be good news for select altcoins, which may attract investors\u2019 interest and resume their up move.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recovery has pulled select altcoins higher. Let\u2019s look at the charts of the top 5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin rose above the 20-day exponential moving average ($41,959) on Jan. 27, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages have flattened out, and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. The BTC/USDT pair may swing between $44,700 and $37,980 for some time.\n\nA break and close above $44,700 will be the first indication that the buyers are back in the driver\u2019s seat. That may propel the price to the local high of $48,970. On the downside, a slide below $37,980 could start a deeper correction toward $34,800.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover on the 4-hour chart, and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating that the bulls are on a comeback. The rally could reach $43,500 and then $44,700.\n\nOn the downside, the moving averages will likely act as a strong support. A break below the 50-simple moving average could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. The pair may then slump to $39,500 and later to $37,980.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nSolana (SOL) climbed above the moving averages on Jan. 27 and is trying to sustain above the downtrend line on Jan. 28.\n\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($93) has flattened out, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating equilibrium between buyers and sellers. If the price maintains above the downtrend line, the SOL/USDT pair could attempt a rally to $107 and then to $117.\n\nIf the bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to quickly pull the price back below the moving averages. That may trap the aggressive bulls, opening the doors for a retest of the support at $79.\n\nThe pair has risen above the downtrend line, invalidating the bearish descending triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart. This is a positive sign as the bulls waiting on the sidelines enter on the failure of the setup, and the bears rush to the exit.\n\nIf buyers hold the price above the downtrend line, the pair is likely to ascend toward $107 and later to $117. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below $85.\n\nAvalanche price analysis\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) has been trading inside a descending channel pattern for several days. Buyers purchased the dip to the support line on Jan. 23 and pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($34) on Jan. 28.\n\nAVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSellers will try to halt the recovery at the downtrend line. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. The AVAX/USDT pair may then spend some more time inside the channel.\n\nInstead, if the price pierces the overhead resistance, it will signal aggressive buying by the bulls. The pair may pick up momentum and rally to $44 and subsequently to the psychologically important level of $50.\n\nThe 20-EMA has started to turn up, and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating solid buying by the bulls. Sellers have successfully defended the downtrend line on three previous occasions; hence, they will try to do that again.\n\nIf the price turns down from the downtrend line but rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will suggest that traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity. That will enhance the prospects of a rally above the channel. If that happens, the pair may start a move to $44.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that bears are fiercely selling at higher levels. The pair may then remain inside the channel for a while longer.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETF ads may appear on Google starting Monday, community speculates\n\nRender price analysis\n\nAfter the initial pullback, Render (RNDR) has been consolidating between $3.56 and $4.40 for the past few days.\n\nRNDR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a balance between the bulls and the bears. If the price turns down from $4.40 and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($4), the RNDR/USDT pair may extend its range-bound action for a few more days.\n\nContrarily, if the price rises above $4.40, it will signal that the buyers have overpowered the sellers. The pair could then rally to $5.07 and eventually to $5.28. A break above this level will indicate the resumption of the uptrend.\n\nThe pair has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. The buyers are trying to gain the upper hand by pushing the price above the triangle. If they succeed, the pair may climb to $4.40 and thereafter to $4.71.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price continues lower and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will indicate that the bears are vigorously defending the downtrend line. The pair may then descend toward the support line.\n\nSui price analysis\n\nSui (SUI) has been in an uptrend for the past several days, but the bears are trying to halt the rally at $1.50.\n\nSUI/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe SUI/USDT pair has formed a rounding bottom pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $1.50. If that happens, the bullish momentum could pick up, and the pair may rally toward $2. The pattern target of the positive setup is $2.64.\n\nHowever, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will fiercely protect the $1.50 level and attempt to pull the price to the 20-day EMA ($1.18). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the likelihood of a rally above $1.50 increases. On the other hand, a break below the 20-day EMA could open the doors for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($0.92).\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are struggling to shove the price above the overhead resistance at $1.50. If the price continues lower and breaks below the 20-EMA, it could start a pullback to the 50-SMA.\n\nAlternatively, if the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and every minor dip is being bought. The pair may then overcome the obstacle at $1.50 and start the next leg of the uptrend.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

At the time, BTC\u2019s price was around $36,000.\n\nSince the first reported BTC balance on Feb. 8, 2021, Tesla\u2019s stock price is down roughly 40% against Bitcoin, specifically:\n\nTSLA vs. BTC: -40.1%\n\nBTC vs. USD: +7.39%\n\nTSLA vs. USD: -35.7%\n\nBTC/USD weekly price chart ft. Tesla\u2019s Bitcoin purchases and sales. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, in a surprising turn, Tesla sold about 10% of its holdings in March 2021. Then, in the second quarter of 2022, the company sold approximately 75% of its Bitcoin reserves. As Tesla CEO Elon Musk noted, these sales intended to demonstrate Bitcoin\u2019s liquidity and to bolster Tesla\u2019s balance sheet during uncertain financial periods.\n\nHad Tesla retained its entire Bitcoin investment, the company could have seen a hypothetical profit of over $300 million, considering the current Bitcoin value of approximately $41,500.\n\nNonetheless, the company\u2019s remaining Bitcoin holdings, estimated at around 9,720 BTC, have remained steady in recent quarters, reflecting a more conservative approach in what traders anticipate to be a bullish year for Bitcoin.\n\nTesla still holds 9,720 #Bitcoin worth $385m and did not sell anyone Q4, 2023. pic.twitter.com/lFFBy6v9I4 \u2014 Radar (@RadarHits) January 25, 2024\n\nTesla may not sell the remaining Bitcoin\n\nInterestingly, Tesla\u2019s previous Bitcoin sales appeared in the quarters reporting weaker free cash flows. It is the cash that a company generates after spending the money required to maintain or grow its business operations.\n\nFor example, in the first quarter of 2021, Tesla\u2019s sale of Bitcoin, valued at $272 million, constituted a staggering 93% of the company\u2019s free cash flows during that period.\n\nTesla free cash flows performance by quarter.

He may not need to employ the same strategy now, however, given Tesla\u2019s increasing free cash flows throughout 2023.\n\nIn Q4, 2023, for example, Tesla\u2019s free cash flow was strong at $2.1 billion, contributing to a total of $4.4 billion for the year.\n\n$TSLA Tesla Q4 FY23:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Revenue +3% Y/Y to $25.2B ($0.6B miss).\n\n\u2022 Gross margin 18% (-6pp Y/Y).\n\n\u2022 Operating margin 8% (-8pp Y/Y).\n\n\u2022 Capex +24% Y/Y to $2.3B.\n\n\u2022 Free cash flow +45% Y/Y to $2.0B.\n\n\u2022 Non-GAAP EPS $0.71 ($0.03 miss).\n\n\u2022 Deliveries +20% Y/Y to 485K.\n\n\u2022 FY24: Volume\u2026 pic.twitter.com/pnOzZkCAde \u2014 App Economy Insights (@EconomyApp) January 24, 2024\n\nNumerous analysts forecast a rise in Bitcoin\u2019s value in 2024, attributing their optimism to the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States and the anticipated impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event as key drivers behind their predictions.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This policy change could see advertisements for the recently-launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) appear on its search engines.\n\nHowever, Google's policy update refers to the allowed products as \"advertisers offering Cryptocurrency Coin Trust targeting the United States,\" leaving some ambiguity. Notably, one of the largest Bitcoin trusts, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), recently converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF following the SEC's approval.\n\nPreviously, GBTC shares were only available to accredited investors on the primary market, subject to a six-month holding period. Accredited investors must meet specific financial criteria, such as having a net worth over $1 million or a high earned income.\n\nIn contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs are available to the general public in the United States and are regulated under the Securities Act of 1933. This makes them a potentially safer option for Google to consider in advertising. The policy update is seen as a positive development, especially given Google's vast reach and influence in driving awareness and inflows for the 10 spot Bitcoin ETF issuers.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency , has weathered recent market volatility with resilience, bouncing back 5% to hit the $42,000 mark on Saturday. Despite this recovery, Bitcoin remains 14% below its post-ETF approval highs.On January 24, Bitcoin was at $39,500, down nearly 20% from around $49,000 \u2014 the three-year high it hit on January 11 in the wake of the decision by the US SEC to approve spot bitcoin ETFs.Siddhartha Gupta, SVP - Business and Strategic Alliances, CoinDCX said, \"Bitcoin's dip below $40,000 post-ETF launch isn't solely due to the event. A prior 15% surge in less than 20 days pushed it into overbought territory. The decline reflects profit booking by major crypto players rather than signalling long-term negativity.\"\"With the imminent halving and potential ETH ETF approvals, our medium and long-term perspective for Bitcoin is bullish and we can look at newer 1-year highs in a short-term period,\" Siddhartha said.In early trade on Saturday, Bitcoin was trading over 5% higher at $42,003. Also, as per reports, over $4 billion of funds have flowed into the new spot bitcoin ETFs, particularly to products operated by BlackRock and Fidelity.Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, highlighted the success of spot BTC ETFs, attracting a remarkable $4.8 billion in inflows within their initial days. Notably, BlackRock leads with almost $1.8 billion in Bitcoin holdings, followed closely by Fidelity with an additional $1.5 billion. Chaturvedi underscores the potential for sustained demand driven by these ETFs and anticipates upward price pressure, particularly with the upcoming Bitcoin supply halving in April.Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, notes that the recent approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs has triggered a surge in the cryptocurrency landscape, with both Bitcoin and Altcoins experiencing a rally. Despite a market dip due to profit-booking and GrayScale outflows, Bitcoin has maintained its position at the $40,000 level, reflecting confidence from institutional and retail investors.Patel predicts substantial inflows of $5-7 billion in the next three months, with a broader perspective foreseeing institutional commitment and potential inflows reaching $500 billion within 2-5 years.Avinash Shekhar, co-founder and CEO of Pi42, draws parallels with the historic ascent of the SPDR Gold Trust in 2004, signalling a growing interest and acceptance of Bitcoin within the traditional financial ecosystem. Shekhar sees BlackRock's achievement of a $1 billion holding in just four days as indicative of a significant shift in the investment landscape.(Subscribe to ETMarkets WhatsApp channel (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Go back and look at Bitcoin halving cycles. The day that Bitcoin halves, multiply it by four 18 months later and it\u2019s been uncanny that that\u2019s been the price of Bitcoin.\n\nI\u2019m using a $35,000 number at the halving and that\u2019s conservative\u2026 Let\u2019s say we\u2019re at $50,000 in April, then it\u2019s a $200,000 handle. Let\u2019s say we\u2019re at $60,000, it will be $240,000.\u201d\n\nScaramucci also predicts that in the long term, Bitcoin\u2019s price will hover close to half a million dollars.\n\n\u201cBut my long-term price target is that Bitcoin gets to easily half of the market capitalization of gold. Gold is now at $14.5 trillion. If Bitcoin goes to $7 or $8 trillion, that\u2019s a 10x from here. It\u2019s a $400,000 Bitcoin, and I think it would be ridiculous for people not to understand the asset, not to understand the dynamics of it as a store of value and not to have a position.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is worth, $42,478.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Is Bitcoin Becoming Less Popular Compared to Other Cryptocurrencies? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -4.46%) is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world, with its name almost synonymous with crypto itself. But over the years, the crypto world has grown in size, and there are more digital currencies available. Let's look at just how popular Bitcoin is right now, and whether or not it has become less prominent over the past year.\n\nCoin dominance is an effective way to gauge popularity\n\nA key metric in crypto is how dominant a coin is compared to the entire crypto market. The calculation is simple: Take a cryptocurrency's market cap and divide it by the total market cap of all crypto.\n\nBitcoin, for example, has a market cap of around $760 billion. According to CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market has a value of $1.5 trillion, which would put Bitcoin's dominance percentage at approximately 50.7%.\n\nThis means it makes up a little more than half of the entire crypto market's total valuation. Ethereum, the next largest coin, has a market cap of $265 billion, putting its dominance percentage at 17.7%. No other cryptocurrency even comes close to a 10% dominance score today.\n\nHow Bitcoin's dominance has changed over the past year\n\nThe dominance percentage can and will change often, depending on not just the price of Bitcoin itself but other cryptocurrencies as well. Here's a breakdown of Bitcoin's dominance percentage at the start of each month, going back to January 2023:\n\nMonth BTC Dominance % January 2023 38% February 2023 41% March 2023 40% April 2023 45% May 2023 45% June 2023 44% July 2023 48% August 2023 47% September 2023 46% October 2023 46% November 2023 51% December 2023 50% January 2024 48%\n\nWhat's interesting to note is that Bitcoin's popularity actually increased over the course of the past year. A big part of that is likely due to the growing anticipation of the approval of several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which finally took place earlier this month. Investors were expecting an uptick in Bitcoin's price due to the approvals, which may have also led to more people buying Bitcoin, hoping to cash in on the rising price.\n\nCan this upward trend continue?\n\nThanks to the approval of more ETFs, Bitcoin may be seen as the most easily accessible cryptocurrency due to the wide range of investing options that are now available. For new investors, it's the most well-known digital currency, and given its large size, it may also be seen as the safest option to choose from.\n\nGiven the high risk in crypto as a whole, new investors may be looking for ways to reduce their risk by going with a big name such as Bitcoin. This safety-seeking approach could lead to a further increase in its dominance percentage.\n\nAnother likely positive catalyst is the next Bitcoin halving, a regularly scheduled event that should take place in April 2024. Halving cuts the rewards for mining bitcoins to ensure that supply is controlled. In the past, halving events have been followed by an increase in the price of Bitcoin, for solid reasons of basic economy.\n\nMining will be less profitable if rewards go down and coin prices don't rise. This blockchain network can't process transactions without mining activity. Hence, the halving events are important moments for Bitcoin's economic model and can influence market dynamics.\n\nDoes Bitcoin's high dominance percentage make it the best cryptocurrency to buy right now?\n\nBitcoin's dominance percentage doesn't make the cryptocurrency a good buy on its own. It's simply a metric that can help investors understand market sentiment and see if Bitcoin is gaining or losing popularity. Furthermore, unexpected factors may come into play and change the trajectory of Bitcoin's dominance trend. But based on the current data, it's evident that Bitcoin remains incredibly popular in the crypto world.\n\nIf you are considering investing in crypto, Bitcoin may be your best option. Generally, when there is bullishness in the crypto markets, it's Bitcoin that is leading the charge. As the largest and most noteworthy digital currency, that's likely to be a pattern for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile new digital currencies will be smaller and could offer greater returns, there is the potential for even more volatility and risk as well. Bitcoin's strong continued dominance is a great way to gauge the strength of its brand in the crypto world. For new investors looking to gain exposure to crypto in their portfolios, Bitcoin may be the best way to do that."

        "title": "UK looks increasingly isolated in its anti-crypto ETF stance - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nThe UK is becoming increasingly isolated as one of the few major global markets to continue to hold back from approving retail access to cryptocurrency exchange traded products.\n\nContinental Europe has them, as do Australia, Brazil and Canada. The US has followed suit most recently with spot bitcoin ETFs, prompting Hong Kong to say it will also jump on board.\n\nYet the UK will not even let small investors buy those listed elsewhere even though Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has championed the UK as a crypto hub and has advocated for a regulatory framework that allows the sector to flourish in Britain.\n\nThe high-profile launch of 10 spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street earlier this month, some managed by household names such as BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity, has heightened the UK\u2019s divergence from most other financial hubs.\n\nThe UK\u2019s stance was defined by a ruling in 2021, when its regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, banned the sale of cryptocurrency-related \u201cderivatives\u201d \u2014 including exchange traded products \u2014 to UK retail investors.\n\nThe FCA\u2019s ban appeared to be largely motivated by the emergence of leveraged products such as contracts for difference, with some operators offering as much as 100 times leverage on bitcoin, itself a highly volatile token. However, it also swept up unleveraged products such as plain vanilla ETPs and futures.\n\nSome industry figures disagree with where the FCA has chosen to draw the line. It did not intervene, for example, in the trading by retail investors of digital tokens directly via crypto exchanges.\n\nUK retail investors \u201ccan invest in crypto, just not through the regulated products\u201d, said Bradley Duke, chief strategist of London-based ETC Group. Its $1bn Physical Bitcoin exchange traded commodity is listed on Euronext Amsterdam and Paris, Frankfurt\u2019s Xetra exchange, the SIX Swiss Exchange and Chicago\u2019s CBOE, but cannot be on the London stock exchange because of the retail ban. In aggregate, continental Europe boasts 120 crypto ETPs with \u20ac8.4bn of assets, according to TrackInsight.\n\n\u201cA UK retail investor can\u2019t invest in a product like ours, a Mifid II [EU regulated] instrument, listed on a regulated exchange and sold through a regulated broker, who would screen you for applicability, depending on your investment objectives and profile,\u201d Duke said.\n\n\u201cBut they can go to a crypto exchange and buy bitcoin without going through any checks and balances, and to me that doesn\u2019t really make sense.\u201d\n\nAndrew Prosser, head of investments at InvestEngine, a London-based investment platform whose 34,000 clients hold \u00a3320mn across almost 600 ETFs, said UK retail investors had two options if they want crypto exposure.\n\n\u201cThey can either buy the coins themselves from digital exchanges. That comes with several problems: the need for digital wallets, private keys, the risk of theft. Or they can buy the shares of companies that track crypto, such as exchanges or miners,\u201d Prosser said.\n\nHe said there were lots of requests on InvestEngine\u2019s community forum for ETPs investing directly in crypto. \u201cSo there is demand for it,\u201d he said.\n\nHector McNeil, co-founder and co-chief executive of London-based HANetf, which lists six ETC Group cryptocurrency vehicles on its ETF platform, said it was \u201cgetting a lot more calls from advisers and discretionary fund managers\u201d, about crypto since this month\u2019s flurry of US launches.\n\nMcNeil said that the recent launches in the US with managers such as BlackRock and Invesco getting involved, meant the asset class was now mainstream. \u201cI think the FCA will have to reassess their position,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he did not believe the regulator should completely open the floodgates to all of the UK\u2019s estimated 9mn self-directed investors.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with general access,\u201d he said, adding that with any more complex product there should be \u201csome sort of gating\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s somebody like me putting 3 per cent of their portfolio in, that should be fine. If it\u2019s my mother wanting to put 100 per cent in because her friend down the social club told her she made loads of money, then I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d McNeil added.\n\nBut he also said crypto ETPs were \u201cno more complex\u201d than inverse or leveraged products, where \u201cthere is a procedure for brokers to give access\u201d to investors who pass a suitability test and have an adequate balance sheet.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me it\u2019s more risky that trading 30 times leverage on a CFD [contract for difference] or spread bet,\u201d McNeil added.\n\nAll the UK regulator had done, he said, is to \u201cpush people to dodgy crypto exchanges. I don\u2019t think they have achieved what they wanted to achieve.\u201d\n\nSmall investors \u201care going through unregulated or under-regulated exchanges where there is no broker involved and there is no one looking out for the suitability of their investments\u201d, said Duke. \u201cThey have to hold the cryptocurrency themselves, which is risky.\u201d\n\nDespite these arguments, Prosser is not convinced the FCA, which declined to comment for this story, will buckle. When the regulator announced its ban in 2021 it also raised concerns about the \u201cintegrity\u201d of the underlying crypto market, its volatility and its links to financial crime.\n\n\u201cUnless the case can be made that crypto has meaningfully changed in the last three years, it\u2019s hard to see why the FCA would authorise them,\u201d Prosser said, while the FCA\u2019s Consumer Duty rules requiring companies to demonstrate fair value for clients, introduced last year, \u201cplaces a lot more duty to assess risk on investment platforms\u201d.\n\nJason Hollands, managing director of Bestinvest, a DIY investing platform, agreed.\n\n\u201cI am personally doubtful that the FCA will authorise bitcoin or other cryptocurrency ETFs to be made accessible to UK retail investors any time soon,\u201d he said. \u201cThe FCA has repeatedly flagged concerns about the extreme volatility of cryptoassets, the high risk of losses and the difficulties retail investors face in valuing them.\u201d"

        "content": "The chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, believes there is a risk the recent approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will be misinterpreted as firm regulations in place for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies in general.\n\nIn a keynote speech on Jan. 26, Behnam clarified there is a potential for retail and institutional investors to misunderstand the legal ruling for spot Bitcoin ETFs following the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) decision to approve 11 applications on Jan. 10.\n\nWhile the approval now allows investors to expose themselves to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset itself, supervised by an SEC-regulated stock exchange, he argued there is no regulatory oversight for the cash market of digital assets, such as a crypto exchange.\n\n\u201cThere remains nothing firmly in place to address the opaque and inconsistent practices in the cash markets for digital assets.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Behnam explains that this has repercussions for the transparency of Bitcoin ETFs, since asset management firms acquire the underlying assets for the ETF from the cash market.\n\nHe raised concerns regarding trade settlement, conflicts of interest, data reporting, cybersecurity, customer protections, transparency and general market integrity.\n\n\u201cThe ETPs have taken a speculative and volatile asset, wrapped it in a thin layer of indirect regulation, and packaged it as a shiny new product,\u201d Behnam stated.\n\nRelated: CFTC pays whistleblowers $16M this year for mostly crypto tips\n\nThe enforcement of crypto regulations has been a prominent topic of discussion within the U.S. government in recent times, prompted by the demand from the crypto industry.\n\nIn September 2023, Cointelegraph reported that the CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham advocated for a limited pilot program to address crypto regulation.\n\nPham warned that the U.S. may soon need to \u201cplay catch-up\u201d to crypto-friendly jurisdictions.

        "title": "The Anatomy of a Cryptocurrency: Breaking Down Bitcoin - Coloradoan",
        "content": "Jon Stojan\n\nContributor\n\nBitcoin can easily be considered the pioneer and the most widely recognized cryptocurrency. With its skyrocketing popularity and acceptance, understanding the underlying architecture and inner workings of this revolutionary form of money is necessary. Let\u2019s break down its anatomy and explore the intricate mechanisms that power this decentralized digital currency.\n\nBitcoin operates on a distributed ledger technology called the blockchain. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the blockchain, it is essentially a decentralized network made up of countless computers, known as nodes, that collectively maintain a public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions. Unlike traditional banking systems, where a central authority oversees transactions, the blockchain empowers individuals to participate in the verification process, and view current prices on cryptocurrencies such as the Ethereum price.\n\nEvery transaction made using Bitcoin is recorded in a \"block,\" which is essentially a bundle of data containing information such as the sender, recipient, and the amount of Bitcoin transferred. These blocks are linked together, like a chain, forming the blockchain. Miners, specialized participants in the network, compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate and add new blocks to the chain. Once a block is added, it becomes virtually impossible to alter, ensuring the security and immutability of the Bitcoin transactions.\n\nTo incentivize miners and maintain the integrity of the network, Bitcoin introduced a concept called \"proof-of-work.\" Miners compete to solve these puzzles by dedicating their computational power and energy to the network. The first miner to successfully solve the puzzle is rewarded with a certain amount of newly minted Bitcoin, a process known as mining. This not only provides an incentive for miners but also regulates the creation of new Bitcoin, preventing inflation.\n\nBitcoin's architecture also incorporates sophisticated cryptographic techniques. Each user in the network possesses a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used to receive funds, while the private key acts as a digital signature, authenticating the user's ownership and authorizing transactions. The cryptographic nature of Bitcoin ensures the security and privacy of users, making it nearly impossible for malicious actors to forge transactions or access sensitive information.\n\nOne of the defining features of Bitcoin is its limited supply. Unlike traditional currencies that can be printed at will, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence. This scarcity, combined with the increasing demand, has driven the value of Bitcoin to unprecedented heights. Moreover, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin eliminates the need for intermediaries, such as banks, to reduce transaction fees and enable borderless transactions.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to evolve, developers are constantly working on improving its architecture and expanding its capabilities. Proposed upgrades, such as the Lightning Network, aim to address scalability issues by enabling faster and cheaper transactions off-chain while maintaining the security of the main blockchain.\n\nBitcoin's architecture represents a groundbreaking departure from traditional financial systems. Its decentralized nature, built on the blockchain, ensures transparency, security, and immutability. Through the use of cryptographic techniques and proof-of-work, Bitcoin has revolutionized the concept of digital currency. With its limited supply and increasing adoption, Bitcoin has proven to be a remarkable store of value and a transformative force in the financial landscape. Understanding the anatomy of Bitcoin helps us better realize its potential and welcome the future of decentralized finance.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin Whales Boost Holdings by $3 Billion - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBitcoin whales, investors who hold large amounts of Bitcoin, have notably increased their holdings. According to data analytics firm IntoTheBlock, these major players have added approximately $3 billion to their Bitcoin holdings since the beginning of the year, equating to around 76,000 BTC. This development is a key indicator of the confidence and investment strategy of the largest holders in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nHolder distribution\n\nThe term \"whales\" in the cryptocurrency world refers to individuals or entities that hold large quantities of digital currencies. Historical data reveals a dynamic shift in the distribution of Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe distribution of Bitcoin holdings across different investor classes provides further insights into market trends. Over a 30-day period, smaller holdings saw mixed changes: Accounts with 0-0.001 BTC increased by 1.02%, while those holding between 0.001-0.01 BTC and 0.01-0.1 BTC witnessed decreases of 1.90% and 1.36%, respectively. Notably, accounts holding between 10K-100K BTC saw an increase of 2.88%, reflecting a concentration of wealth at the higher end of the spectrum. When analyzing addresses by their holdings in USD, a similar trend emerges. Addresses holding less than $1 increased by 4.61%, while those holding over $10 million decreased by 2.15%.\n\nRecent trends show a 1.31% decrease in whale holdings over 30 days, juxtaposed with a 2.15% increase among investors and a marginal 0.02% decrease in retail holdings.\n\nInterestingly, the seven-day change in large holders' inflow increased by 119.83%, while the 30-day and 90-day changes showed a decrease of 83.23% and 91.25%, respectively.\n\nThis contrastingly large outflow in the short term, with an increase of 8,274.96% over seven days, indicates a volatile yet strategic play by these large holders, impacting the overall market sentiment and pricing.\n\nUnderwhelming price performance\n\nThe month opened with Bitcoin at a value of $42,208 and witnessed a notable surge, reaching a high of $49,000 following the approval of multiple Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency did not maintain this upward trajectory. Mid-month, Bitcoin saw fluctuations, with its price oscillating between $41,801 and $43,148, indicating a period of uncertainty and adjustment among investors.\n\nThis trend continued as the Bitcoin price dropped below the $40,000 mark. The latter part of January showcased a partial recovery, with the cryptocurrency closing at $42,120 on Jan. 27 after opening at $41,863."

        "content": "The federal government has seized more than $150 million in drug funds, largely in Bitcoin, from one man from India\u2014and although his crimes touched other countries and states, the defendant was extradited to and charged in Columbus.\n\nBanmeet Singh, a 40-year-old man from the city of Haldwani, pleaded guilty in federal district court in downtown Columbus on Friday. Singh has been in the U.S. since 2023 following a 2019 arrest in London.\n\nAside from the seizure, Southern District of Ohio U.S. Attorney Kenneth Parker said at a media conference Friday that Singh could be facing eight years in prison for what he pleaded guilty to, which includes conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute controlled substances and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nU.S. Department of Justice and Drug Enforcement Administration officials have said Singh\u2019s case is the biggest cryptocurrency seizure the DEA has executed to date.\n\nSingh built vendor websites on the dark web to sell fentanyl, LSD, ecstasy, Xanax, Ketamine, and Tramadol, according to Parker. Customers primarily used Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency by-and-large, to pay Singh for the substances he then sent or arranged to have sent, according to court documents.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2017, Singh was at the helm of eight U.S. drug distribution cells. One of those was in Columbus, which is why Parker said he pushed to prosecute Singh in his court.\n\n\u201cWe were showing that when you impact the Southern District of Ohio, we\u2019re going to go where we need to, to address those people,\u201d Parker said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we brought him here, to deal with him. We have venue here. This should be addressed here. Our citizens are equally important as anyone else.\"\n\nParker said the case shows how criminals adjust to new technology to avoid detection.\n\n\u201cOur dedicated men and women of law enforcement will go where the investigation leads, the dark web or other places to properly seize the ill-gotten gains.\u201d\n\nFederal and local agencies in central Ohio and elsewhere assisted with the case through the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, or OCDETF. As of Friday afternoon, Singh\u2019s sentencing hearing had yet to be scheduled, according to a Southern District of Ohio spokesperson."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin ETFs has made it more difficult for the US government to ban or restrict Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s capped supply is a feature that could contribute to its reliability as a store of value.\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin ETFs has increased the involvement of major financial institutions in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of Bitcoin ETFs has garnered substantial attention, primarily for its potential to influence Bitcoin\u2019s price in the near term.\n\n\n\nHowever, the more profound and enduring impact lies in the heightened challenge the US faces in regulating or prohibiting Bitcoin in the long run.\n\nThe Short-Term Popularity of Expanding Money Supply\n\nFifteen years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto brought attention to a persistent issue in the realm of monetary politics when he introduced the Bitcoin white paper . He highlighted the concern that governments possess a strong political incentive to devalue their official currencies, enabling them to spend beyond their means.\n\nBitcoin white paper: Digital signatures provide part of the solution. Bitcoin core: Let's segregate the signature data. pic.twitter.com/7hqvCVKqYZ \u2014 Daniel Street (@Daniel__Street) January 20, 2024\n\nConsequently, governments are often enticed to augment spending without raising taxes, resorting to borrowing to bridge the gap, and when that approach becomes unsustainable , they resort to creating more money by printing. In the long run, the proliferation of currency can erode the purchasing power of each individual, leading to inflation.\n\n#Crypto Vs Inflation\ud83d\udca5 \ud83d\udc49Inflation erodes the purchasing power of traditional currencies over time.\n\n\ud83d\udcaaOne of the key strengths of many #cryptocurrencies , like #Bitcoin , is their capped supply, providing a hedge against inflationary pressures\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcc9#SendCrypto #SendersLife #dApps \u2014 SendCrypto_App / sendc.eth (@SendCrypto_App) January 25, 2024\n\nNakamoto and his peers aimed to address this challenge by capping the supply of Bitcoin at 21 million units. Unlike traditional fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, euro, yen, or renminbi, which can be expanded by governmental authorities over time, the total number of Bitcoins in circulation cannot be easily manipulated by political actors.\n\nCan the U.S. Government Restrict Bitcoin?\n\nIf Bitcoin outshines the U.S. dollar as a store of value, concerns arise about a potential U.S. government ban on the cryptocurrency. Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio voiced this concern, stating that \u201cOutlawing Bitcoin is a good probability\u201d due to historical parallels, such as the 1930s prohibition of private gold ownership and the imposition of foreign exchange controls.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, a direct ban on Bitcoin by the U.S. government is implausible, given Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature that operates independently of U.S. jurisdiction. While China banned Bitcoin mining in 2021, a significant portion of mining continued in China through methods like virtual private networks.\n\nNonetheless, the U.S. could exert its influence by limiting dollar-to-bitcoin exchanges, restricting mainstream banks from engaging with Bitcoin businesses, imposing regulatory challenges on corporate Bitcoin holdings, and creating obstacles for retail businesses accepting Bitcoin as payment. In essence, while it cannot obstruct the Bitcoin network, the U.S. could make it cumbersome for average Americans to access and use Bitcoin, similar to historical measures like the 1933 prohibition of private gold ownership.\n\nETFs Significantly Complicate the Possibility of Banning Bitcoin\n\nThe approval of new Bitcoin ETFs is a pivotal development. It has enabled major financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, and Franklin Templeton to hold billions of dollars in Bitcoin, making this cryptocurrency accessible to a broader range of investors who may have been hesitant to engage with cryptocurrency exchanges or manage private Bitcoin keys.\n\nThis shift holds immense significance, intensifying the vested interest in expanding Bitcoin\u2019s role within U.S. financial markets. Policymakers contemplating restrictive measures regarding Bitcoin will now encounter opposition not only from individual enthusiasts but also from influential financial players who wield considerable influence in Washington.\n\n\"Crypto is clearly not the problem!\" Republic Senator Cynthia Lummis blasts Elizabeth Warren.https://t.co/t66wcmd0j4 \u2014 CCN (@CCNDotComNews) January 24, 2024\n\nThis dynamic heightens the challenges for policymakers looking to actively curb Bitcoin adoption, as special interest groups in Washington hold substantial sway in shaping policy decisions. Currently, over $25 billion in Bitcoin is held in exchange-traded funds, with approximately one billion flowing in just two weeks after the SEC\u2019s approval, representing substantial financial assets, even for industry giants like BlackRock.\n\nSEC\u2019s Approach to Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC has been a contentious issue, as the Commission recognizes the complexities involved. While the SEC\u2019s regulatory framework dictates that it should not determine Bitcoin\u2019s investment suitability, it has steadfastly resisted offering investors exposure to Bitcoin through a mainstream, regulated financial instrument for the past decade. This resistance is driven by the SEC\u2019s awareness that endorsing Bitcoin in this manner could significantly spur investor interest in the digital asset.\n\nI wonder what the AUM of these ETF products looks like after the first year fight for traction concludes. Fee under cutting, mass advertising and publicly endorsing Bitcoin should not be ignored.#BTC pic.twitter.com/00JpmFprkc \u2014 McKenna (@Crypto_McKenna) January 25, 2024\n\nThe SEC\u2019s greenlight for spot Bitcoin ETFs came only after unanimous legal pressure, prompted by a ruling from Neomi Rao of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Rao\u2019s opinion deemed the SEC\u2019s resistance to Bitcoin ETFs as \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d particularly given that the agency had already approved similar products for Bitcoin futures and other commodities.\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler, while critical of Bitcoin as a \u201cprimarily speculative, volatile asset\u201d with illicit uses, acknowledged that Rao\u2019s opinion compelled the Commission to act. Notably, two other Democratic appointees on the Commission, Caroline Crenshaw and Jaime Liz\u00e1rraga, voted against the January ETF listings."

The company, which is preparing for a public listing, aims to achieve a hash rate of 8 exahashes per second (EH/s) by 2024.\n\nThe newly unveiled mining unit is already operational, as reported by CoinDesk, and is part of Swan Bitcoin\u2019s strategic growth ahead of its initial public offering (IPO). The mining operation is expected to bolster the company\u2019s revenue streams and provide a foundation for its public market debut.\n\nBitcoin mining is the network\u2019s consensus mechanism by which new Bitcoins are entered into circulation. In this process also known as proof-of-work, node operators, or miners, validate transactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards.\n\nBitcoin adds a new block of transactions to its blockchain every 10 minutes which comes with 6.25 Bitcoins as the miner\u2019s reward. This amount is cut in half roughly every four years, in an event known as \u201cthe halving.\u201d\n\nAs halving slows down the amount of Bitcoin generation, some market watchers argue that Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity increases every halving cycle which can have a positive effect on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nThe next halving is expected to occur this coming April and will reduce mining rewards to 3.125 Bitcoins per block."

Is the crypto correction close to ending?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price tanks on GBTC FUD and institutions taking profit, IntoTheBlock says\n\nThe price correction of Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, is caused by the FUD about Grayscale's mass-selling and profit-taking initiated by largest players. Such statements were made by top research platform IntoTheBlock in its recent on-chain insights report.\n\nIn this week's newsletter, we evaluate the claims behind the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF FUD.

Technically, Grayscale's GBTC, which had been at a discount relative to the firm's Bitcoin (BTC) holdings for two years, was converted into an ETF. This caused whopping outflows that contributed to the BTC price tumbling.\n\nEven being accompanied by a $1 billion outflow from the FTX holdings portfolio, this catalyst should not be overestimated. Despite these negative processes, Bitcoin ETFs registered a significant $820 million net inflow, which hints at solid interest from large buyers.\n\nThe addresses holding over 1,000 BTC each are buying en masse, data says. They were increasing their holdings through the entire year of 2023, but in January this process accelerated.\n\nAt the same time, large hedge funds decided to take profits, which is also a major bearish price catalyst. Their activity pushed the price to new local highs in Q4, 2023, but now the situation looks the opposite:\n\nAs the ETF approval window began we see that premium in futures quickly turning into a discount suggesting firms began taking profits\n\nBy printing time, Bitcoin (BTC) is changing hands at $41,715; the largest cryptocurrency recovered almost 4% in the last 24 hours.\n\nBTC price's negative catalysts losing steam?\n\nHowever, in the last days, some positive news for Bitcoin (BTC) arrived. IntoTheBlock says GBTC outflows have also slowed down in the last two days.\n\nAlso, China's central bank announced its readiness to inject $140 billion into its financial system, which might be another catalyst for the crypto capitalization surge.\n\nAs covered by U.Today yesterday, digital assets expert Ilan Solot from Marex Solutions said that \"the worst was over\" for crypto as the GBTC bearish narrative failed to push the Bitcoin (BTC) price lower."

        "content": "A passionate cryptocurrency and blockchain author qualified to cover every event in the crypto space. Researching minute occurrences and bringing new insights lie within the prime focus of my task.\n\nStory Highlights The Bitcoin price is slowly coiling up to reach the next crucial resistance at $43,500 after testing one of the pivotal levels at $42,200\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin has displayed a similar price action, which suggests the token could undergo a massive price action in the coming days\n\nEver since the genesis of Bitcoin, which was a result of the financial crisis of 2008\u201309, it has never left any stone unturned to surprise the world. In the past few days, the token has faced huge turmoil and landed below $39,000. Amid speculations of a continued descending trend, the BTC price triggered a strong rebound and is now heading towards the pivotal level at $43,000. However, the token needs to surpass some important levels, which may only validate a rise beyond the bearish influence.\n\nBitcoin is currently bouncing from the double trendline support confluence, which was seen in the first few days of 2023. The rebound that was triggered then caused a 180% rise in the price until the end of the year, and hence a similar pattern could lift the price toward new highs. Regardless of the minor pullbacks in the short term, the long-term price action remains bullish, with the new ATH to be above $100K.\n\nConsidering the historical price action, the BTC price has always consolidated before starting a bull run.\n\nThe above chart indicates that the BTC price is still in the middle of the recovery phase. The token has displayed a similar price action in the past, and hence the prevailing consolation may continue for some more months. Beyond this, a bullish breakout could push the price above the current highs, close to $70,000 and begin with a fresh bull run towards a new ATH in late 2024 or early 2025.\n\n\n\nA popular analyst, Michael van de Poppe, believes the impact of the spot Bitcoin ETF launch may be witnessed in the next few years. With this, the BTC price may even go as high as $300K or even $500K. Until then, the Bitcoin price may continue to consolidate between $37,000 and $48,000 for the coming months, while the altcoins will have their time."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nNew Bitcoin ETFs launched in the US this month could become some of the largest BTC whales in existence.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s GBTC currently holds the most Bitcoins, but others are closing the gap.\n\nCollectively, spot Bitcoin ETFs could become a powerful force in financial markets, influencing crypto prices and trading activity around the world.\n\nThe launch of the first US-listed spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) earlier this month marked the end of a year-long campaign for regulatory approval. But the real journey has only just begun.\n\nAs Bitcoin enters its ETF era, meaningful volumes of institutional money could flow into crypto for the first time. With the arrival of new capital sources, ETF managers are set to become major players in the global Bitcoin market \u2013 wielding what some predict will be hundreds of billions of dollars of buying power.\n\nETF Managers Are the New Bitcoin Whales\n\nAccording to one estimate, Bitcoin ETFs could raise $40 billion in 3 years, with the market ultimately swelling to over $400 billion.\n\nEven though the cryptocurrency\u2019s price has retraced by nearly 20% since the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) first announced its approval of 11 spot Bitcoin funds, at the close of trading on Monday, January 22, the new ETFs held assets worth nearly $27 billion. With a net asset value (NAV) of $22.95 billion, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC is currently the largest of the lot. But rivals could soon close the gap.\n\nUnlike its peers, GBTC wasn\u2019t always structured as an ETF. In its previous life as a unit investment trust, GBTC had a monopoly on the market for exchange-listed Bitcoin products and it still towers over other funds.\n\nHowever, an exodus of Grayscale investors has already started to reshape the leaderboard. At present, the second and third largest funds, managed by BlackRock and Fidelity, have a NAV of $1.4 billion and $1.26 billion respectively.\n\nBitcoin ETF Fund Flow Scorecard \u2013 Good & Bad News The bad news\n\n1) Grayscale dumped a ton of bitcoin\n\n2) For the 8th day in a row, GBTC transferred an additional 18,500 Bitcoin to Coinbase.\n\nThe good news\n\n1) The majority of the sell-off involved FTX, which has now completed its\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SPiepYc4oB \u2014 InvestAnswers (@invest_answers) January 23, 2024\n\nWith 3 ETFs already valued at over a billion dollars, Nansen\u2019s Principal Research Analyst, Aurelie Barthere, told CCN that she expects the new funds will come to overshadow the whales that have traditionally influenced the price of Bitcoin, shifting the balance of power away from large individual investors.\n\nEven before ETFs arrived on the scene, the analysts noted that the concentration of ownership was already trending downward. Nevertheless, she said that 0.4% of BTC wallets still controlled as much as 60% of the cryptocurrency\u2019s total supply. Going forward, \u201cI would expect ETFs to accelerate this redistribution to new buyers, especially retail traders and retail investors,\u201d Barthere said.\n\nLiquidity and Volatility in Crypto Markets\n\nConsidering Bitcoin\u2019s historical tendency for sensational interday price swings, the redistribution of coins and liquidity boost provided by new ETF investments could reduce market volatility, but Barthere cautioned against overstating the impact.\n\nBitcoin's current halving cycle is 93% complete. In the past two cycles, there was strong volatility at this time. And immediately after the halving, a steady growth started.#btc #cryptocurrencies #bullrun pic.twitter.com/RgHwN8qThj \u2014 Ananta (@cryptoclubtitu) January 19, 2024\n\nAlthough she predicted that ETFs will ultimately lead to less dramatic price spikes, \u201cyou can still have very major drawdowns, even in very liquid markets,\u201d Barthere observed. \u201cYou still need to have the risk appetite to go into crypto,\u201d she added, noting that the generally volatile nature of cryptocurrencies remains unchanged.\n\nFor all its unpredictability, however, Bitcoin is still known to follow certain patterns. These too could fall under the influence of ETFs buying and selling activity.\n\nDaily Bitcoin Cycle Could Sync With US Trading Hours\n\nAccording to a 2022 study , Bitcoin trading activity typically peaks just after the opening of US stock markets. Meanwhile, price volatility tends to follow an M-shaped pattern, with 2 peaks that coincide with the opening of US and European exchanges.\n\nPost-ETF approval, asset managers based in New York and Chicago are set to drive an increased volume of trading activity. In turn, the cryptocurrency\u2019s daily trade cycle may become even more synced to US Trading Hours.\n\nBitcoin trading activity tends to peak just after the US stock market opens.\n\nFor example, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes predicted that ETFs will drive \u201cstatistically significant trading behavior on and around 4 pm EST,\u201d when they publish their NAV for the day.\n\nNoting that Bitcoin ETFs calculate their NAV according to the CF Benchmark, which collates price data from various global crypto exchanges, Hayes said he anticipates a surge in arbitrage trading around that time as traders seek to leverage differences between the CF Benchmark and spot prices on individual exchanges.\n\nCrypto in the Global Economy\n\nWhile cryptocurrency exchanges are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, synchronization with the trading hours of traditional securities exchanges implies their interconnectivity.\n\nPost-ETF launch, with Bitcoin no longer isolated from the world\u2019s largest financial markets, the symbolic and material barriers that have historically separated crypto from traditional finance suddenly look flimsy. More than ever before, Bitcoin is now embedded within the core infrastructure of the global economy, marking the beginning of a new era for the world\u2019s preeminent cryptocurrency."

        "title": "2 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Hand Over Fist in January - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The recent pullback in the crypto market could be the perfect opportunity to buy the dip in undervalued cryptos. But which ones?\n\nTwo cryptos on my radar right now are Bitcoin (BTC -4.46%) and Solana (SOL -0.12%). Both started off the year with tremendous momentum, but are now trading a steep discount from where they were just a month ago. Let's take a closer look at the case for buying them now.\n\n1. Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin seemed to be a no-brainer crypto investment at the beginning of January. At that time, Bitcoin was trading around $45,000, and impending SEC approval of the new spot Bitcoin ETFs was supposed to send the price of Bitcoin soaring. But that simply has not been the case. Bitcoin now trades under $40,000, and concerns are mounting that the \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" phenomenon could continue to send Bitcoin lower.\n\nBut that's OK. Bitcoin has a second catalyst in the works that could ultimately unlock much more value: the next Bitcoin halving. This event is now scheduled for April 2024, and if everything goes according to plan (a big \"if\"), it could be huge for Bitcoin.\n\nThat's because Bitcoin has had three previous halving events (2012, 2016, and 2020), and each one has been spectacular. In 2020, for example, the halving eventually propelled Bitcoin to an all-time high of $69,000 per coin. The thinking is that we could soon see another all-time high for Bitcoin at the $100,000 mark or higher by the end of 2024.\n\nOf course, past performance is no guarantee of future performance, so just be careful of expecting too much, too soon. Typically, every Bitcoin halving cycle 's bullish phase lasts for 12 to 18 months, so it might be sometime in 2025 before Bitcoin blasts off into the stratosphere.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving was once an event entirely reserved for crypto enthusiasts only, but what is truly remarkable this time around is how deeply big-name investors are buying into the idea of the halving. That gives me more confidence that this catalyst will not disappoint.\n\n2. Solana\n\nSimilar to Bitcoin, Solana seemed to be a no-brainer crypto investment for 2024. At one point last year, Solana was up more than 1,000% and seemed to be unstoppable. With just one week to go until the new year, Solana was trading for over $120. So it seems almost unfathomable that Solana is now trading around $80.\n\nTwo factors seem to be behind this substantial drop in value. For one, all the hype around the new Bitcoin ETFs has meant less institutional money flowing into Solana. That has placed a cap on just how much higher Solana can go over the short term. At one point in January, Bitcoin accounted for nearly 98% of all institutional money flowing into crypto.\n\nSecondly, the whole \"Solana is the next Ethereum (ETH -4.36%)\" argument seems to have been turned on its head. The new narrative apparently is \"Ethereum is the next Ethereum.\" There's buzz building over a new speed-boosting Ethereum blockchain upgrade, as well as new hype over a potential spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nAccording to this narrative, investor money will flood into Ethereum as soon as the SEC approves this new ETF. From my perspective, though, investors are much less excited about an Ethereum ETF than a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nLong story short, this could be a perfect buy-the-dip opportunity for Solana while everyone else is focused on Ethereum. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest recently appeared on CNBC, making a bullish case for why Solana is a superior investment to Ethereum. Nothing has changed here. It's still faster and more cost-efficient.\n\nAnd I would argue that Solana is now innovating at a much faster pace than Ethereum. Solana now has a mobile crypto strategy that appears to be picking up steam. The Saga \"crypto phone\" officially launched last April, and Solana will launch a new, lower-priced version this year. At the same time, Solana is gaining ground with its blockchain payment strategy, thanks to a new partnership with Visa.\n\nRisk factors\n\nIt's important to point out that both Bitcoin and Solana -- like all cryptos -- are very volatile, risky assets. In terms of overall risk-reward profile, though, Bitcoin is likely a \"safer\" investment than Solana. It now has increasing approval from Wall Street (with a few notable exceptions, such as Jamie Dimon). And it has a much longer track record of delivering market-beating performance than Solana.\n\nThat being said, both cryptos are worthy of a closer look. Short-term factors appear to have pushed down their prices in January, but their long-term outlook remains relatively unchanged. I'm still bullish on Bitcoin as the future of digital money, and I see Solana as the first-ever smart contracts blockchain able to take on Ethereum on its digital home turf -- and win."

        "content": "Vanguard decided not to offer clients access to Bitcoin ETFs because the flagship cryptocurrency is an \u201cimmature asset class\u201d that does not align with its company philosophy, according to the firm\u2019s executives.\n\nVanguard Global Head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker and Index Relations Janel Jackson made the statement during a QA session, where she clarified the investment firm\u2019s stance on Bitcoin and digital assets.\n\nAccording to Jackson:\n\n\u201cWhile crypto has been classified as a commodity, it\u2019s an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio.\u201d\n\nNo plans for Bitcoin ETF\n\nJackson said that Vanguard would not launch a Bitcoin ETF or any crypto-related products, considering the current state of cryptocurrencies as an asset class.\n\nShe highlighted that the decision-making process for introducing new investment products at Vanguard is rigorous and prioritizes long-term investment merit and client needs. Despite the growing discourse around Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, Vanguard does not view them as suitable for inclusion in long-term investment portfolios.\n\nMeanwhile, the company\u2019s Head of Brokerage & Investments, Andrew Kadjeski, emphasized that Vanguard\u2019s investor base primarily consists of long-term, buy-and-hold investors, and the firm\u2019s offerings reflect these clients\u2019 interests.\n\nHe added that despite the ease of allowing full access to crypto products, such a move would not align with Vanguard\u2019s mission to serve the best long-term interests of its investor-owners.\n\nBoth Jackson and Kadjeski reflected on Vanguard\u2019s history of forgoing short-term trends for long-term stability. Vanguard had steered clear of internet funds in the 1990s and more recently removed access to leveraged and inverse funds and ETFs in 2019 and over-the-counter stocks in 2022 due to their high risk and potential for misuse.\n\nBacklash\n\nVanguard\u2019s stance toward Bitcoin ETFs has sparked significant reactions in the investment community. The firm\u2019s stance, focused on traditional asset classes like equities, bonds, and cash, has led to frustration among some of its clients, particularly those who advocate for including cryptocurrencies in investment portfolios.\n\nIndustry experts have suggested that Vanguard might lose credibility and assets due to its stance on Bitcoin ETFs, as it appears to be a move contrary to the current market trend where many investors are seeking exposure to digital assets.\n\nNotably, other major players in the asset management space, like BlackRock, have embraced Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting a divergence in strategies within the industry.\n\nDespite Vanguard\u2019s resistance to Bitcoin ETFs, some analysts believe the company might eventually soften its stance. The growing popularity of digital assets and pressure from competitors could be influential factors in such a potential shift.\n\nHowever, Vanguard remains committed to its traditional investment approach, focusing on asset classes that it considers foundational for long-term investment success."

        "content": "A top Bitwise executive acknowledged on Jan. 26 that his firm\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF has received hundreds of dollars of unsolicited Bitcoin.\n\nCo-founder & CTO Hong Kim wrote that the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) received 998,085 satoshis worth $419 across 35 UTXOs over two days.\n\nHe suggested that this will simply increase the ETF\u2019s value, writing:\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] negligible compared to the [fund\u2019s assets under management] (~$511 million as of yesterday) but those sats are added to [net asset value] and accrue to the benefit of shareholders.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether the additional funds could instead be donated to Bitcoin developers, Kim noted that 10% of the fund\u2019s profits are donated to open-source Bitcoin development. However, this donation policy was part of Bitwise\u2019s earlier ETF plans and is not a direct response to the receipt of the latest funds.\n\nTransfers to Bitwise\u2019s Bitcoin address were seemingly prompted by the firm\u2019s decision to post its address publicly, which occurred on Jan. 24.\n\nReasons behind transactions are unclear\n\nThe motivations for the transactions are unclear. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas implied that the transfers were benevolent, writing:\n\n\u201cCurious to see if this is a one-off or start of something and we see [people] toss tips into the proverbial ETF jar like if the fund had a good year or just for the hell of it.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the intent may be malicious, as small unsolicited transactions are typically referred to as \u201cdusting\u201d attacks.\n\nYet Kim ruled out any such problems, writing:\n\n\u201cHandling [dusting] isn\u2019t that hard for an institutional custodian and the framing that you can \u2018attack\u2019 a public bitcoin address by sending it free sats doesn\u2019t hold truth.\u201d\n\nHe specifically denied the possibility of harm through connections to questionable addresses. Kim wrote that the ETF\u2019s custodian, Coinbase Custody, will flag any funds received from OFAC-sanctioned addresses. Such funds will be \u201cleft untouched\u201d without being added to the ETF\u2019s net asset value, he said.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "A trader who caught the 2023 crypto breakout says that Bitcoin (BTC) still looks strong even after breaking below $40,000 last week.\n\nIn a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 56,700 YouTube subscribers that while the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) turned out to be a sell-the-news event, BTC still managed to avoid a total price collapse.\n\nAccording to the trader, the absence of immense BTC selling is a constructive sign for the crypto king.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been liking this price action for the last couple of days. I think just in general with how the ETF played out and how we got the sell-the-news event, you would have reasonably expected prices to go lower. But they were very hesitant to do so, and every time they went it was just a little bit of a trickle-down instead of the typical sell-the-news thing where you just get massive volume and just completely craters.\n\nIt could be enough. I\u2019m not team bear anymore. If anything, I\u2019m team wanna-be bull.\u201d\n\nThe trader also says that Bitcoin appears to be consolidating within a strong uptrend. He says BTC will likely regain its bullish momentum once it takes out resistance at $44,000.\n\n\u201cThe weekly time frame, if you just look at that, if it closes like this and starts breaking out above $44,000\u2026. there\u2019s no good reason to be bearish. Obviously, it can go down afterward but just from a TA (technical analysis) perspective, this is literally as sideways as it can get in a very strong trend.\n\nYou would expect that if that sideways range breaks to the upside that you just get follow-through.\n\nNot looking too bad if it continues like this for the weekend and then we have a little bit of a strong showing on Monday. I\u2019m not hating on this chart.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $42,416, up over 9% from its seven-day low of $38,678.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The virtual coin dropped below $40,000 (to $38,678) on Tuesday, but slowly recovered as the week went on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is now trading for $41,830, CoinGecko data shows, a less than 1% movement over seven days.\n\nBefore Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF started trading, it had operated like a closed-end fund where investors could not redeem their shares for BTC. However, following its conversion and subsequent trading, investors started to cash out quickly.\n\nThis led Grayscale to send huge amounts of the cryptocurrency to its custodian, Coinbase, leading to pressure on BTC\u2019s price.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s sell-off slowed towards the end of the week\u2014likely leading to the rebound in BTC\u2019s price.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news, though: Analysts told Decrypt that Bitcoin \u201ccould see increased appeal\u201d in 2024\u2014if the Federal Reserve slashes interest rates.\n\nBut BTC\u2019s plunge in the week hit the wider crypto market.

It\u2019s now trading for $2,264.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIts drop came following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s decision to delay ETH ETF proposals from both BlackRock and Grayscale.\n\nElsewhere, Solana (SOL) took a beating.

        "content": "Deutsche Bank survey indicates pessimistic Bitcoin price outlook, with 33% expecting it to drop below $20,000 by 2024, while 15% anticipate stabilization between $40,000 and $75,000.\n\nThe recent Deutsche Bank survey, conducted between January 15-19, 2024, involving 2,000 respondents from the US, UK, and Eurozone, has revealed a rather pessimistic outlook for Bitcoin's price. The findings indicate that over one-third of the respondents believe that Bitcoin's value could drop below $20,000 by the end of 2024. In contrast, around 15% of the surveyed individuals maintain a more optimistic view, anticipating that Bitcoin\u2019s price could stabilize between $40,000 and $75,000 by year-end.\n\nThis bearish sentiment among retail investors is influenced by several factors, including the recent performance of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. After reaching a peak of around $49,000 on January 11, 2024, attributed to the excitement surrounding the launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the U.S., Bitcoin's price subsequently experienced a significant decline, falling to around $39,791. The report by Deutsche Bank analysts suggests that the introduction of new spot Bitcoin ETFs might further institutionalize Bitcoin, yet the majority of ETF flows have originated from retail investors.\n\nMoreover, the survey highlights broader concerns about the stability of the cryptocurrency market. More than half of those surveyed expressed fears of a major cryptocurrency collapse in the next two years, likely fueled by incidents like the fall of the crypto exchange FTX in 2022 and the collapse of the stablecoin terraUSD (UST), coupled with ongoing regulatory crackdowns in the U.S.\n\nIn the context of Bitcoin ETFs, the market has seen record outflows, particularly affecting Grayscale Investments' Bitcoin Trust ETF, despite overall positive trends since their inception. Industry experts and companies, including Tesla, remain bullish on BTC\u2019s long-term outlook, expecting substantial capital inflows into ETFs.\n\nThese findings and market behaviors reflect a cautious or skeptical approach towards the future of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, amid regulatory uncertainties and past market issues. The survey also underlines a significant gap in the understanding of cryptocurrency, with two-thirds of consumers admitting to having little or no knowledge of digital assets, which could be contributing to the cautious sentiment.\n\nIn summary, while the short-term outlook for Bitcoin appears bearish according to the survey, the long-term perspective, as suggested by industry experts and certain corporate players, remains more optimistic\u200b\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

This move is significant for the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors, as it increases exposure and awareness among a vast audience. The policy change will require advertisers to comply with local regulations.\n\nStarting January 29, 2024, Google will implement a major policy change by allowing advertisements related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies , including Bitcoin ETFs, to be published on its platform. This move is initially focused on the United States, with plans to expand it globally. This development is significant for the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors, as it opens up new avenues for exposure and awareness among a vast audience.\n\nGoogle's advertising network is known for its extensive reach, capable of targeting billions of people worldwide. The new policy requires advertisers to comply with local regulations, ensuring that the ads meet specific standards. This change follows Google's decision in December 2023 to revise its guidelines regarding cryptocurrencies and related assets, aiming to clarify parameters for promoting Coin Trusts linked to cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe effect of this policy change is expected to be considerable, given the massive reach of Google Ads, which covers around 90% of the global population. The precise targeting capabilities of Google's advertising platform, including demographic data, interests, habits, and recent searches, are likely to enhance the effectiveness of these campaigns. This could lead to a significant increase in the awareness of Bitcoin ETFs, not just among traders and investors, but also among the general public, potentially opening up new opportunities for exposure to Spot ETFs.\n\nIn the broader context of the cryptocurrency market, this development arrives at a time when the industry is witnessing various shifts and trends. Analysts suggest that Bitcoin could attract greater interest throughout 2024, with macro signals indicating potential growth in the digital asset sector. However, views on Bitcoin's future role and its correlation with other financial assets like gold and the US dollar vary among experts.\n\nIn summary, Google's decision to allow Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ads, starting with Bitcoin ETFs, marks a significant moment for the cryptocurrency industry, potentially leading to increased institutional and retail exposure, and influencing market dynamics and investor behavior in 2024 and beyond\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Bitcoin Sentiment Sours: What\u2019s Behind the Pessimism?\n\nSince the SEC approved Bitcoin on January 10, the price of the cryptocurrency has dropped 15%. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs was heralded as a very bullish development. The major withdrawals from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which converted from a closed-ended trust to an exchange-traded fund (ETF), are blamed for this decline.\n\nNot all of the more than $3 billion that has been redeemed from GBTC has gone into other Bitcoin ETFs. VC Chris Burniske, with a pessimistic outlook, believes that Bitcoin may drop to $20,000.\n\nWhy is everyone suddenly bearish about bitcoin? Opinion by @danielgkuhn for The Node newsletterhttps://t.co/PZVWMlupAC \u2014 CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) January 26, 2024\n\nLong-term obstacles to Bitcoin appear to be minimal despite worries, as regulatory clarity is projected to improve and GBTC outflows are anticipated to come to an end.\n\nThe introduction of the ETF, which has drawn record-breaking volumes and retail investors, represents the long-term viability of the asset class.\n\nCFTC Chair Advocates for Stricter Bitcoin ETF Regulations\n\nFollowing the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has underlined the urgent need for federal legislation to govern the cash market for digital assets. Behnam emphasized the absence of regulatory control for the cash market of digital assets while voicing concerns about possible misinterpretations by institutional and ordinary investors.\n\nA \u201cthin layer of indirect regulation,\u201d he claimed, surrounds Bitcoin ETFs, bringing up concerns about trade resolution, conflicts of interest, data reporting, cybersecurity, consumer protection, transparency, and market integrity.\n\nIf you're considering an investment involving crypto assets, be cautious. Crypto asset securities may be marketed as new opportunities but there are serious risks involved.

A bullish USDT.D chart is traditionally interpreted as bearish for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as it indicates traders are unloading their crypto holdings in favor of the stablecoin.\n\nBennett predicts that USDT.D will climb higher after bouncing from a critical support level.\n\n\u201cAnother 20% lower for BTC from current levels?\n\nThat\u2019s what the Tether dominance USDT.D chart suggests. This moves inversely to Bitcoin, and the levels on this chart have been spot on since October. It would put BTC around $30,000.

The highlight of January was undeniably the groundbreaking move by the world's largest hedge funds and financial institutions, ushering in the era of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese developments set off a roller-coaster ride for Bitcoin, with its price oscillating between $48,969 and $38,555 in just 28 days. However, as January bids farewell, the main cryptocurrency has made a resilient rebound, closing the month with a modest gain of 0.7%, nearly retracing its steps to the starting point.\n\nBTC to USD by CoinMarketCap\n\nAs we step into February, all eyes are on the historical data of Bitcoin prices, and the patterns hint at an intriguing trend.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recent approval of a Bitcoin BTC ) Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) has sent ripples through the financial world, marking a significant milestone in the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. This groundbreaking development provides both institutional and retail investors with a regulated and accessible means to invest in Bitcoin, bypassing the complexities of handling the digital currency directly. The anticipation is palpable, as this shows all signs of ushering in a new wave of capital into the crypto market , possibly elevating Bitcoin's price and its overall market capitalization.The performance of Bitcoin ETFs has been notably impressive, defying some initial scepticism. Contrary to the belief that these ETFs were underperforming, they have actually attracted significant attention and investment, ranking among the top US ETFs in terms of trading volume and inflows. Despite a drop in Bitcoin prices following the launch of these ETFs, which led to apprehensions about their success, the overall metrics tell a different story. The ETFs have not only seen high trading volumes but have also experienced substantial inflows, indicating a strong market interest. This success highlights a growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as a viable asset and marks a significant development in the cryptocurrency space, demonstrating the potential of Bitcoin ETFs to reshape the investment landscape.Now that we have the ETF out of the way, what is going to happen to Bitcoin prices?Historical trends in Bitcoin's price movements suggest that the cryptocurrency often reaches new all-time highs approximately a year before its cycle peaks. According to top analysts, this pattern indicates that BTC's value could surge beyond current records, potentially surpassing $80,000 by the end of 2024. However, the journey is unlikely to be straightforward. Market volatility could be a significant factor, especially when considering the influence of macroeconomic factors and institutional investors' perceptions of BTC as a risk asset.Institutional investors are going to play a big role in shaping Bitcoin's future. Their perception of BTC as a 'digital gold' and a safe-haven asset is expected to drive substantial inflows into the Bitcoin ETF . Conversely, if BTC continues to be viewed primarily as a risk asset, its growth trajectory might be more restrained, particularly in the face of challenging macroeconomic conditions.While the Bitcoin ETF is a critical development, it represents just one aspect of the evolving crypto ecosystem. Several key developments loom on the horizon, poised to shape the future of the cryptocurrency market:The anticipated upgrades to Ethereum, particularly the Denune upgrade, are expected to significantly enhance its scalability and reduce transaction costs. This could catalyse widespread adoption of Ethereum's Layer 2 solutions, potentially challenging the dominance of other Layer 1 networks. The growing prominence and improved regulatory clarity surrounding stablecoins are set to make them more integral in daily transactions. Ethereum and its Layer 2 networks are likely to be at the forefront of this stablecoin expansion.Certain governments, especially those facing international sanctions, may begin utilising Bitcoin for international trade. This move could further establish BTC's position as a global, decentralised digital asset independent of any single nation's control. Following recent changes in financial reporting rules, an increasing number of publicly traded companies are expected to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This trend could create a ripple effect, encouraging a broader range of companies to diversify their holdings in Bitcoin.Despite these positive developments, the path ahead for Bitcoin and the crypto market is fraught with challenges and opportunities. Regulations, technological advancements, market adoption, and general economic conditions will all have an impact on Bitcoin's future, which is still in its early stages of development.The regulatory landscape remains a pivotal factor in the crypto market's future. Positive regulatory developments, like the Bitcoin ETF approval, provide a boost, but the market is still in need of more comprehensive regulatory clarity and guidance from authorities across the globe.Advancements in blockchain technology will be crucial in determining the scalability, security, and overall adoption of cryptocurrencies. Ongoing innovations, such as Ethereum's upcoming upgrades and the development of decentralised applications (dApps), are set to open new avenues for crypto usage.The ultimate success of cryptocurrencies will hinge on their adoption by mainstream users, not just as investment vehicles but also in everyday transactions and digital finance. Global economic factors, including inflation rates, interest rate changes, and geopolitical events, will continue to exert a significant influence on investor sentiment and market dynamics within the crypto space.The approval of a Bitcoin ETF is a remarkable step forward for the cryptocurrency market, signalling a new era of maturity and acceptance. However, this marks just the beginning of a more complex journey. A complex interplay of regulatory decisions, technological advancements, market dynamics, and global economic factors will influence the future of Bitcoin and the larger crypto ecosystem. As we witness the continued evolution of the crypto market, it presents a mix of challenges and opportunities for investors, innovators, and regulators. What lies ahead is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the cryptocurrency world is embarking on an exhilarating new phase, with all eyes focused on what unfolds next.(Subscribe to ETMarkets WhatsApp channel (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Discover SCENE\n\nLast week, a poem by Ana Maria Caballero sold for 0.28 Bitcoin or $11,430 at Sotheby\u2019s. The poem by Caballero, \"Cord,\" was featured in an online auction of Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions called Natively Digital.\n\nThe Natively Digital collection was designed as a deep dive into the world of the NFT-like Ordinals on Bitcoin, and contained notable early inscriptions. In addition to the inscription, the buyer of \u201cCord\u201d will also receive a signed print of the poem.\n\nMichael Bouhanna, VP and Head of Digital Art at Sotheby\u2019s, tweeted this week that \u201cCord\u201d is the first-ever individual poem sold by the 280-year-old auction house, not including manuscripts and books.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe significance of the Sotheby's auction for \"Cord\" was not lost on Caballero, who called it an opportunity to affirm written poetry's inherent worth.\n\n#AuctionUpdate: \u2018Cord\u2019 by @CaballeroAnaMa achieves $11,430 (0.28 BTC).\n\nAccompanying the digital piece, the collector of 'Cord' will also receive a signed print of the poem. pic.twitter.com/UdltWiQfoK \u2014 Sotheby's Metaverse (@Sothebysverse) January 22, 2024\n\n\u201cIt's an incredible opportunity to make a statement that words and language and poetry have value on [their] own,\u201d Caballero told Decrypt after the sale. \u201cNot with anything else attached, not with visuals, not with sound, not with any other kind of experience. Just the language of the poem, just the text of it, is what was sold.\u201d\n\n\"Cord\" will feature in Caballero\u2019s upcoming book Mammal. Other artists in the Natively Digital auction included FAR, XCPinata, Nullish, Rudxane, Jennifer and Kevin McCoy, Popoki, Shroomtoshi, Des Lucr\u00e9ce, and Claudia Hart. One inscription tied to the \u201cQuantum Cats\u201d collection sold for over $250,000.\n\n\u201cI was in touch with Michael Bouhanna from Sotheby's because he wanted to put together a sale for Ordinals. I thought the curatorial theme should be about archeology in the blockchain,\u201d FAR told Decrypt on Twitter. \u201cSo I thought having a poem would be interesting, and I invited Ana.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn her writing career, Caballero has won several awards, including the Beverly International and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Arango National Poetry Prizes. Along with Kalen Iwamoto and Sasha Stiles, Caballero launched the digital poetry and NFT gallery theVerseverse in 2021.\n\nIn August, theVerseverse collaborated with the Fahey/Klein Gallery in Los Angeles to create an exhibition that combined Ginsberg\u2019s photograph with AI-generated poetry. While \u201cMuses & Self: Photographs by Allen Ginsberg\u201d mimicked the Beat Generation icon's style, the display drew mixed reactions from the poetry community.\n\nCongrats to Ana whose work is incredibly well received ! The first poem ever sold @Sothebys \u2763\ufe0fhttps://t.co/QEj4rU1orF https://t.co/CaqtDG1Nap \u2014 Michael Bouhanna (@michaelbouhanna) January 22, 2024\n\n\u201cAna explores the influence of biology on societal and cultural rituals,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s wrote on Twitter. \u201cHer work unveils the reality behind romanticized motherhood, challenging the narrative of sacrifice as a virtue.\u201d\n\nAs Caballero explained, \u201cCord\u201d is written in a style of poetry called a villanelle. A villanelle is a poem with 19 lines and five stanzas, similar to a paragraph with three lines each and one stanza with four lines. A villanelle uses two repeated rhymes and two lines used multiple times.\n\n\u201cI love that value statement for poetry, and for verse, especially because this is a poem about motherhood; it's about pregnancy, about the body, about embodiment,\u201d Caballero said. \u201cSo it's even more meaningful in what tends to be a very male-dominated space,\u201d she said, adding that the auction for \u201cCord\u201d received over 40 bids.\n\nCaballero said she chose to participate in the project using a centuries-old poetic form to \"pay homage to the technically complex chain that is Bitcoin, you know, that launched it all.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Google has potentially opened the door to allow advertisements for Bitcoin and crypto ETFs.\n\nThe increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies is likely the driving force behind Google\u2019s decision.\n\nThe crypto community has responded positively to the news.\n\nThe digital currency world is abuzz with speculation after a major search engine, Google, announced an upcoming policy change that could pave the way for advertising certain cryptocurrency products. While the details remain vague, many believe this move could significantly impact the burgeoning Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market.\n\nBitcoin ETFs to Receive Google Ad Boost?\n\nThe update, scheduled for January 29th, will allow companies offering \u201cCryptocurrency Coin Trusts\u201d to advertise their services to users in the United States. This coincides with the recent approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which essentially allows investors to acquire a stake in the fund\u2019s Bitcoin holdings through shares.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 BIG NEWS \ud83d\udea8\n\n\n\nGOOGLE WILL ALLOW #BITCOIN\n\nAND CRYPTO ETF ADS FROM 29TH\n\nJANUARY 2024.\n\n\n\nBULLISH \ud83d\udd25 \u2014 Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) January 26, 2024\n\nAnalysts are particularly optimistic about the potential impact of this change, considering the search engine\u2019s massive reach and ability to influence user behavior. With billions of daily searches processed, advertising on this platform could lead to significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nReports are circulating that Google will be changing their policy and allowing #Bitcoin ETF ads starting on Jan 29th.\n\n\n\nGoogle processes 100K searches/sec \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\n\nBitcoin is going to have unprecedented levels of institutional and retail exposure.\n\n\n\nPrepare accordingly \u2014 The \u20bfitcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) January 25, 2024\n\nHowever, uncertainty still hangs over the exact types of products allowed under the new policy. The term \u201cCryptocurrency Coin Trust\u201d lacks the specificity desired by many, leaving room for interpretation and speculation.\n\nFintech Giants To Follow?\n\nDespite the ambiguity, some industry giants have already taken advantage of the changing landscape. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, previously only accessible to accredited investors, recently converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF, opening its doors to the general public.\n\nThis shift aligns with the potential regulatory framework surrounding Google\u2019s new policy, as spot Bitcoin ETFs fall under the purview of the Securities Act, offering a seemingly safer advertising option than other, less regulated crypto products.\n\nThe potential impact of Google\u2019s decision is undoubtedly significant. With Bitcoin already gaining momentum after the SEC\u2019s ETF approvals, this latest development could further propel the digital currency into the mainstream.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nGoogle has not always been open to crypto advertising, and they may reverse this decision if they feel it is not in their best interests.\n\nThe term \u201cCryptocurrency Coin Trust\u201d is not very specific, and it is possible that it could be interpreted in a way that allows for the advertising of risky or fraudulent products.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThis move by Google could be a turning point for the crypto industry, bringing Bitcoin and related products closer to a wider audience. Whether it\u2019s a full-fledged embrace of Bitcoin ETFs or a more cautious approach, the future of crypto advertising on Google promises to be potentially transformative.\n\nRead here for more on the recent surge in assets under management for BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF and what it might mean for the future of Bitcoin:\n\nBlackRock Bitcoin ETF Hits $2B AUM Milestone in Two Weeks\n\n\n\nWondering about the challenges and potential benefits of Bitcoin ETFs?

        "content": "In a groundbreaking development for Bitcoin\u2019s data indexing landscape, Trac Core has announced the launch of \u201cTrac Core for TAP Protocol,\u201d according to a Jan. 26 press release.\n\nTrac Core\u2019s journey began in May 2023, focusing on developing decentralized data indexing technologies based on Ordinal-based metaprotocols. The TAP Protocol launch marks a pivotal moment in simplifying and streamlining the data indexing process on the Bitcoin network.\n\nWith the introduction of \u2018Trac Core for TAP Protocol,\u2019 Trac Core is advancing its technology and incorporating key standalone protocols like TAP and PIPE, signaling a new chapter in data management and utilization in the blockchain arena.\n\nUser-friendly approach\n\nThe standout feature of \u2018Trac Core for TAP Protocol\u2019 is its user-friendly setup. Developers can now quickly deploy operational environments with a straightforward command, bypassing the traditional complexities of setting up Bitcoin Core and Ord Wallet.\n\nThis ease of use is expected to attract a broader range of developers and innovators to the Bitcoin ecosystem, fostering diverse projects and applications. Additionally, Trac Core\u2019s open-source nature invites global contributions, ensuring continuous improvement and evolution of the platform.\n\nThe Trac Network Ecosystem is a collaborative framework that includes indexers (writers), validators, and peers (readers). Indexers are crucial in maintaining the network\u2019s robustness by contributing their indexing results.\n\nValidators, on the other hand, ensure the accuracy of this data and compensate indexers with $TAP tokens. Peers, integral to the ecosystem, access this validated data at no cost, supporting various applications and marketplaces.\n\nSustainability Focus\n\nRunning on the widely adopted NodeJS development platform, Trac Core is optimized for compact devices like the Raspberry PI 3\u20135. This capability allows for multiple protocol instances on a single device, which is far more cost-effective and environmentally responsible than conventional methods.\n\nThe immediate availability of \u2018Trac Core for TAP Protocol\u2019 is just the beginning. Trac Core\u2019s ambitious roadmap includes the forthcoming releases of Bitmap, Bitmap Parcels, Ordinals, Wallets, PIPE Protocol, and Doginals.\n\nThroughout 2024, Trac Core plans to unveil additional tools, apps, and indexer packages and finalize the deployment of validators and incentive structures, outlining a comprehensive and forward-looking journey."

        "title": "[ANALYSIS] Bitcoin ETF controversy to continue - koreatimes",
        "content": "Authorities wary of heightened investor protection concerns due to escalating Hong Kong ELS debacle\n\nBy Lee Kyung-min\n\nThe financial authorities' ban on the local trading and brokerages of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will take an extended political turn, influenced largely by voter sentiment in the lead-up to the April 10 general election, according to market watchers.\n\nMost at issue is whether the National Assembly will be able to revise the Capital Markets Act to render moot the Financial Services Commission's (FSC) Jan. 11 judgment that the digital coins do not fall within the definition of \"underlying assets.\" The decision was grounds for local brokerages to suddenly halt overseas spot bitcoin ETF trading services that began in 2021, including in Canada, Australia and Germany. Some even went a step further to halt futures bitcoin ETF services, only to resume after the FSC said the ban would be limited to spot trading.\n\nExperts say the definition could be expanded to recognize the virtual coins as valid underlying assets, because their value can be appraised accurately through a proper, rational method.\n\nHowever,in greater play are investor protection considerations, a key voting issue for Koreans who almost always look to the government for remedy after incurring heavy losses. Bitcoin, extremely volatile by nature, will end up fueling controversy over regulatory and institutional failures to prevent or at least mitigate the price volatility. This is an unwanted yet clearly foreseeable course of matters for the FSC, certain to become a liability for the incumbent administration in election times.\n\nThe FSC announced the ban hours after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot bitcoin ETFs, Jan. 10 (local time). Many local investors expected Korea would follow suit, allowing them to join the global craze in the 132 trillion won ($100 billion) spot bitcoin trading this year.\n\nLegal interpretation\n\nLegal experts say bitcoin qualifies as an underlying asset under a subclause of the act.\n\nBitcoin does not fall under the categories of financial investment instruments, currencies, general goods or credit risks.\n\nHowever, it can, according to Jin Hyun-soo, an attorney at law firm Decent, in the context of \"a risk relating to economic phenomena that can be appraised in a reasonable and appropriate way in the form of prices, interest rates, market indexes and/or any unit of measurable financial instruments.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin prices are set by supply and demand in the market, so the case can be made that it has an intrinsic value,\" Jin said. \"If it comes down to a matter of interpretation, the case for the definition will merit the approval of spot ETFs.\"\n\nWait and see\n\nHowever, the point of contention will move beyond the legal realm and take a political turn, as indicated by a shift in the presidential office's cryptocurrency policy directives.\n\n\"We have advised the FSC against a decisive stance about spot bitcoin ETFs,\" presidential chief of staff for policy Sung Tae-yoon said during a Jan. 18 briefing.\n\nThe presidential office, according to the official, was \"reviewing whether the country's legal system should undergo changes in the context of financial market developments overseas as well as the scope and degree of side effects anticipated thereafter.\"\n\nThe new \"wait-and-see\" approach came about a week after, when the FSC issued a statement to make sure the ban remains in place.\n\nThe FSC announced a spot trading ban on Jan. 11, stating that the brokerage service providers are prohibited from buying, holding or leveraging the digital coins, as outlined in the law enacted in 2017. Also banned is making equity investments with bitcoin. The rushed enactment resulted from heated criticism of government inaction despite rampant cryptocurrency speculation at the time.\n\nAs for futures, however, the issues are cleared because the derivative products track market indexes, not physical coins, it added.\n\nOn the same day, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong said cryptocurrencies were now \"an official investment vehicle.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin has definitely become an investment asset,\" he told reporters. \"Now it will be about the stability and vulnerability of the virtual asset. This is a step further from the previous debate on whether digital coins should and would be recognized as fiat currencies and the probability of them replacing traditional currencies.\"\n\nDifference in risks\n\nMarket watchers say futures ETFs are not any more volatile or speculation-oriented than existing futures or options trading.\n\nThis is because bitcoin futures concern the contracts between investors and bitcoin futures transactions operated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a U.S. derivatives exchange.\n\nIt means the risks of default, fraud remittances and account hackings are nonexistent, as guaranteed by the CME, a well-established financial investment system encompassing the digital coins as well as futures trading.\n\nHowever, spot trading comes with much greater risks.\n\nSpot transactions will enable direct management of the digital coins in the investment vehicle, subjecting investors and crypto brokerage service providers to an extreme fluctuation in valuations.\n\nUS \u2018caved' to investor demands\n\nThe SEC approval was more about tolerating, not actively embracing the digital coins, industry insiders said.\n\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler said investors should be aware of the risks associated with the speculative assets, a comment that came immediately after the commission gave its approval.\n\nBehind the clear reluctance toward cryptocurrency was U.S. financial authorities' failure to provide grounds to frustrate a claim by Grayscale, a U.S. digital currency asset management company.\n\nGrayscale filed a suit in 2022 after the SEC denied its request seeking to create spot ETFs. The U.S. Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., found in favor of Grayscale the next year, essentially ruling the futures and spot ETFs are not materially different. The SEC did not appeal the decision.\n\n\"The U.S. authorities didn't want to approve it, but had no way of stopping that in time,\" an industry official close to the matter said. \"The private sector holds greater say in the U.S., and investors there do not seek remedy with the government over failed investments.\"\n\nInvestor protection\n\nThe comment coincides with the heightened concerns of financial regulators, especially in light of skyrocketing losses from the troubled equity-linked securities (ELS) tied to the performance of the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI).\n\nInvestor losses from high-risk, high-volatility derivatives make headlines every few months, and somehow the government always ends up taking the blame, according to the official.\n\n\"ELS is quite volatile, but not as much as bitcoin would be if spot trading was allowed,\" he said. \"Furious investors will want someone to take the fall. The accountability issues over what is mostly concluded as incomplete sales will weigh heavily on the authorities.\""

        "content": "FTX has put forward an unconventional plan in its rush to repay billions to customers.\n\nBitcoin is the linchpin for FTX\u2019s future, yet relying on it might backfire.\n\nDespite progress being made, FTX acknowledges that customers might incur losses.\n\nThe once-booming FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange that spectacularly imploded in 2022, is clawing its way back from the ashes to repay billions owed to its customers. Through asset sales and risky Bitcoin derivatives trading, FTX has managed to amass $4.4 billion, but the path to full customer recovery remains fraught with uncertainty.\n\nFTX\u2019s Rocky Road to Repayment\n\nFTX\u2019s dramatic collapse in November 2022 sent shockwaves through the crypto market, erasing billions of dollars in value and leaving a trail of angry investors. Once hailed as a leader in the industry, the exchange was revealed to be insolvent, riddled with internal mismanagement and potentially fraudulent activity.\n\nSince then, FTX has been engaged in a desperate scramble to repay its debts. In August 2023, a plan was unveiled to partially compensate customers with a mix of cash and equity in a revived FTX platform, dubbed FTX.com, aimed at international users.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, FTX had accumulated $4.4 billion by December 2023, a significant increase from the $2.3 billion reported in October. This windfall stemmed primarily from two sources: asset sales, with $1.8 billion raised in December alone, and Bitcoin derivatives trading, a high-risk strategy employed to manage risk and potentially generate profits from FTX\u2019s sizable crypto holdings.\n\nBitcoin Holds Key to FTX\u2019s Future\n\nHowever, this apparent progress is overshadowed by concerns about the sustainability of FTX\u2019s recovery efforts. Experts like Zerohedge have raised red flags regarding FTX\u2019s heavy shorting of Bitcoin futures, essentially betting against the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. If Bitcoin experiences a significant price surge, it could exacerbate FTX\u2019s financial woes, jeopardizing its ability to repay its debts fully.\n\nAll the major BTC moves have been due to futures liquidations pic.twitter.com/I3umtqRmbS \u2014 zerohedge (@zerohedge) January 23, 2024\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, FTX itself has acknowledged the possibility of falling short on its repayment obligations, with FTX users potentially facing the brunt of the losses. The once-dominant crypto exchange\u2019s journey toward redemption appears far from over, leaving investors and customers alike in a precarious wait-and-see situation.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nBitcoin derivatives trading carries inherent risks, and potential profits are not guaranteed.\n\nShorting Bitcoin futures is a risky strategy, and a price surge could further cripple FTX\u2019s finances.\n\nThe dependence on risky strategies, lack of clarity on remaining assets, and potential shortfalls highlight the precariousness of FTX\u2019s situation.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nFTX\u2019s downfall sent shockwaves through the crypto market, eroding investor confidence and contributing to a wider industry downturn. The exchange\u2019s efforts to recover are being closely watched, as they could have significant implications for the future of the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nWondering what happened to the lawsuit against SBF\u2019s parents?

The case pertains to the alleged Bitcoin scam which came to the fore in 2020. (REUTERS)\n\nThe accused were arrested on January 24, and sent to custody the next day.\n\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\n\nThe Special Investigation Team (SIT) of CID, probing the scam, presented accused inspector Prashanth Babu and cyber expert Santhosh Kumar KS before the first additional chief metropolitan magistrate court\n\nDirector general of police (DGP), Inspector General, Alok Mohan stated, \u201cThe CID-SIT arrested two people \u2014 inspector Prashanth Babu from the Technical Support Centre and cyber expert Santhosh Kumar KS, CEO of GCID Technologies Pvt Ltd. A probe is underway.\u201d\n\nAn FIR has been lodged under IPC sections 343 (wrongful confinement), 409 (criminal breach of trust by a public servant), 426 (mischief), 34 (common intention), 36 (omission), 37 (cooperation in crime), 201 (destruction of evidence), and 204 (destruction of documentary evidence).\n\nThe case pertains to the alleged Bitcoin scam which came to the fore in 2020. There were allegations that several senior BJP leaders, including the then Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai, were allegedly involved in laundering \u2018ill-gotten money through cryptocurrencies\u2019 with the help of a Bengaluru-based hacker, Srikrishna aka Sriki.\n\nThe Central Crime Branch (CCB) police had arrested Sriki on November 18, 2020, in a drug peddling case. He had allegedly bought drugs from international dealers using bitcoins on the dark web, police said. During the questioning, the CCB found that the software engineer-turned hacker was also involved in a series of online crimes.\n\nSriki confessed to being part of a group of hackers that broke into a cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex on August 2, 2016. They collectively stole 120,000 Bitcoins, worth around \u20b972 million.\n\nThe issue became political when allegations came up against the Bengaluru police that they had information about his involvement in the Bitcoin hack in December 2020 but did not reveal this information to central agencies until August 2021.\n\nApart from Babu, the SIT also lodged an FIR against inspectors Lakshmikanthaiah, Chandradhar, and Shridhar K Pujar\u2014 all of them are associated with the CCB wing in Bengaluru \u2014 in connection with the Bitcoin scam. The trio are being questioned but haven\u2019t been arrested yet.\n\nBabu has been accused of buying a computer for \u20b960,000, which was employed in hacking websites. Technical analysis by the SIT said Kumar remotely operated the laptop, accessed Sriki\u2019s Amazon server, and \u201cerased historical data and evidence\u201d.\n\nOfficials said, Babu and cyber expert Santhosh Kumar KS have also been accused of orchestrating the transfer of Bitcoins, amounting to over \u20b92.8 lakh, from their accounts to Kumar\u2019s account in instalments.\n\nInspectors Lakshmikantaiah and Chandradhar had facilitated this transaction by escorting the accused Sriki to Kumar\u2019s lab.\n\nAccording to the FIR, Pujar who is presently serving as DSP, has been accused of keeping Sriki in unlawful custody for three days, and also detaining Sriki\u2019s associate Robin Khandelwal illegally for four days.\n\nThe FIR has further implicated the four officers in two additional cases filed in 2020 \u2014 in Ashok Nagar and Bengaluru City Cybercrime police stations. One of the cases involves complainant Yashoda Devi who has alleged that she was \u201cdeceived into investing in the Bitcoin trade\u201d. In the second case, Sriki has been charged with stealing data from gaming sites.\n\nThe officers reportedly took Sriki and Khandelwal unofficially to GCID Technologies Private Limited, where Kumar participated in the inquiry and later engaged in unauthorised transactions, allegedly stealing fractions of Bitcoin."

The financial and market information provided on U.Today is intended for informational purposes only. U.Today is not liable for any financial losses incurred while trading cryptocurrencies. Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nYear's beginning for Bitcoin is often viewed as a critical time period, where the tone for the rest of the year is set, and for traders, it is a time marked by heightened volatility and planning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe yearly opening is essentially the price at which Bitcoin starts trading on the first day of the year. It sets a psychological benchmark for traders, acting as a reference point for gauging market sentiment and performance over the year.\n\nPullbacks to this level can be particularly important as they often serve to test the strength and resilience of the ongoing market trend. If the price bounces off this level, it can reinforce the notion that the market is bullish, potentially leading to increased buying pressure. Conversely, a breakdown below the yearly open can signal bearish sentiment, possibly leading to further declines.\n\nA comprehensive analysis of the Bitcoin chart indicates that the asset has experienced significant volatility, with prices swinging between bullish surges and bearish pullbacks. The moving averages are converging, which typically suggests a period of consolidation as the market decides on its next major move. The current price hovers around $42,507, with the yearly opening acting as a critical pivot point.\n\nGrowth scenario for Bitcoin\n\nIn the bullish scenario, if the price finds solid support at the yearly opening and demonstrates a strong bounce-back, it could signify underlying market strength. This could potentially lead to a rally toward the first major resistance level, which may be at approximately $44,000, aligning with the 50-day moving average. A breakout above this level could see Bitcoin aiming for the $46,000 mark, near the 200-day moving average.\n\nWith sustained trading volumes and positive market sentiment, Bitcoin might target the psychological level of $50,000. This would represent a significant recovery and could also instigate a positive feedback loop, attracting more investors to the market."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Prediction as BTC Rallies 10% From Recent Bottom and ETH Sees $5 Billion Flood In \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin\u2019s price prediction seems bullish, especially as it experiences a noteworthy upswing, currently trading at $42,220, marking a nearly 1% increase on Sunday.\n\nThis positive trend in Bitcoin\u2019s valuation coincides with a high-ranking representative\u2019s praise of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, hailing it as a \u201chuge success\u201d across various metrics.\n\nSimultaneously, the US dollar is witnessing a decline in the wake of recent inflation figures, setting a critical stage for the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting next week. These developments collectively paint a complex but intriguing picture for Bitcoin\u2019s future in the financial landscape.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Declared \u2018Huge Success\u2019 by Top Official\n\n\n\nSince its recent inception, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has seen strong growth, and in an interview with Yahoo Finance, U.S. Head Rachel Aguirre expressed pleasure with the outcome. After receiving permission from the SEC, IBIT\u2019s trading volume increased to an astounding $3 billion in just two weeks, drawing in $1.6 billion in capital.\n\nAguirre highlighted BlackRock\u2019s dedication to giving investor\u2019s access to Bitcoin, praising the product for its three USPs: better accessibility, the removal of hassles related to direct Bitcoin ownership, and offering high-caliber support.\n\nBREAKING: The BlackRock iShares #Bitcoin Trust is a huge success by multiple metrics, according to Rachel Aguirre, U.S. Head of iShares Products. pic.twitter.com/ZOVZEgR3dC \u2014 sunnydecree (@sunnydecree) January 24, 2024\n\nAlthough Aguirre refuted rumors of a spot Ethereum ETF, she praised BlackRock for being ahead of the curve in gauging investor demand. BlackRock currently has 16,361 BTC in order to fund IBIT.\n\nThe favorable reaction highlights the increasing interest of institutions in cryptocurrencies, which is probably pushing up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nUS Dollar Weakens Post-Inflation Data, Ahead of Fed Meeting\n\n\n\nFriday saw a little decline in the value of the US dollar as December inflation statistics confirmed the market\u2019s expectations of a mid-year interest rate drop by the Federal Reserve. Though it might have gained for a fourth week in a row, the dollar index fell 0.1% to 103.41.\n\nIn line with expectations, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index increased by 0.2%, preventing annual inflation from rising above 3%. Analysts say there is no reason for the market to be concerned about inflation anytime soon, which lessens the chance of more tightening.\n\nUS dollar slips after inflation data, Fed meeting looms next week \u2013 The Economic Times https://t.co/o391aoNCWW \u2014 FOMC Alerts (@FOMCAlerts) January 28, 2024\n\nThe dollar\u2019s rise is being restrained by mounting disinflationary pressures globally, even though U.S. rate futures priced in a 47% chance of a rate decrease in March.\n\nThe situation with Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming better, and if investors continue to be concerned about inflation, they may become more interested in inflation-resistant assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nOn January 28, Bitcoin (BTC/USD) exhibits a steady uptrend, currently trading at $42,401, marking a 0.66% increase. The four-hour chart highlights pivotal price levels that are key to Bitcoin\u2019s immediate trajectory. The pivot point is placed at $42,161, with the asset facing immediate resistance at $43,394, followed by higher resistance levels at $44,372 and $45,581. Conversely, support levels are established at $40,957, $39,644, and $38,618. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 70, indicating a strong buying interest that borders on overbought conditions. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at $40,820, offering a significant support level. A notable chart pattern is Bitcoin\u2019s breakthrough above a double top around the $42,160 level. Closing above this could signal a robust buying trend, with potential for further upward movement. The overall trend for Bitcoin is bullish above the $42,160 mark. Ethereum Price Prediction On January 28, Ethereum exhibits a promising uptrend, trading at $2,289.7, a gain of 0.97%. The four-hour chart analysis highlights critical levels influencing Ethereum\u2019s short-term market dynamics. Its pivot point rests at $2,321, with immediate resistance observed at $2,388. Subsequent resistance levels are marked at $2,476 and $2,560. On the downside, Ethereum finds immediate support at $2,241, with further levels at $2,169 and $2,102. Read More: Ethereum Price The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54, indicating a neutral market momentum. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is at $2,314, closely aligning with the current price trajectory. Chart analysis reveals that Ethereum has completed a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $2,313. However, a downward trendline near the $2,300 mark may pose a hurdle for further upward movement. Overall, Ethereum presents a bullish trend above the $2,320 threshold. In the short term, it is expected to test the resistance levels, especially at $2,388, providing traders and investors with key indicators to watch in the coming days."

        "content": "Sat 27 Jan 2024 \u25aa 3 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nBitcoin is preparing to pen an exciting new chapter. Pantera Capital, a leader in cryptocurrency management, has big plans for BTC. The firm anticipates an unprecedented bullish rally, even amidst the current downturn. This article explores their bold forecasts. It also examines the market dynamics of crypto, potentially transformative for digital finance.\n\nThe winds are shifting for bitcoin\n\nPantera Capital\u2019s annual report doesn\u2019t just skim the surface. In fact, it predicts a meteoric rise of Bitcoin despite the miners\u2019 panic. Relying on thorough analysis, the firm foresees a significant increase in activity in the DeFi market.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Innovations in tokenization and zero-knowledge proofs also promise to play a pivotal role in this ascent.\n\nSeveral factors are on the verge of propelling bitcoin to new horizons. The anticipated Halving, a mechanism that cuts the mining reward in half, is traditionally associated with an increase in BTC value due to its scarcity.\n\nIn addition, the SEC\u2019s approval of cash-settled Bitcoin ETFs opens up new opportunities. The introduction of programmable features strengthens the bullish outlook for the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nIn spite of a retreat after the ETF approvals, optimism abounds. A survey reveals that 79% of digital asset users anticipate a price increase following the Halving. The past supports this optimism. In fact, since the last Halving in 2020, the price of Bitcoin has surged by 401%.\n\nToward an evolved ecosystem\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin ETFs opens new doors, drawing the attention of institutional investors. This step, according to Pantera Capital, should not only boost the market but also encourage more structured regulation around cryptocurrency. This would, in turn, support a wider adoption.\n\nPantera points out that the bitcoin ecosystem is set to diversify. Layer 2 networks will enhance scalability and smart contracts. The company predicts the emergence of a standard development language for Bitcoin, similar to Solidity for Ethereum. This would consolidate Bitcoin as a cornerstone of blockchain innovation.\n\nWith the Halving approaching and the excitement around Bitcoin ETFs, the market is preparing for an unprecedented bull run. The institutional appetite for BTC, combined with the evolution of its ecosystem, promises to energize the value and adoption of cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to Pantera Capital, the increase in activity in DeFi and tokenization indicate a promising summer for Bitcoin. The total value locked (TVL) in Bitcoin-related projects is expected to experience significant growth, marking the beginning of a new era for decentralized finance on the Bitcoin blockchain. Despite the storm, optimism prevails in the market.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Vanguard founder John Bogle, who launched the first index fund for ordinary investors in 1976, was no enthusiast for bitcoin. Photograph: Ryan Collerd/New York Times\n\nFund giant Vanguard attracted fevered online criticism after refusing to offer investors access to the recently launched bitcoin ETFs, saying it \u201cdoesn\u2019t fit with Vanguard\u2019s investment philosophy\u201d. The outraged mood was encapsulated by investor Mike Alfred, who told his 146,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter) that Vanguard is part of an \u201cevil empire\u201d and is \u201con its way to the dustbin of history\u201d.\n\nVanguard was \u201cunrecognisable\u201d from the innovative and investor-friendly firm founded by John Bogle, he added.\n\nIn reality, the decision of Vanguard, a non-profit firm owned by its investors, was both principled and unsurprising. Vanguard says a responsible portfolio should consist of assets like stocks, bonds and cash. Vanguard investors cannot access leveraged ETFs or gold ETFs, so a bitcoin ETF was never likely.\n\nAnd as for the late John Bogle, he was wary of ETFs in general, believing they fostered trading. And bitcoin? Bogle said to avoid it \u201clike the plague\u201d."

        "content": "DISCLAIMER: This article is a SPONSORED Press Release and does not constitute Finbold's editorial content nor undergo monitoring. Crypto assets/products involve significant risks. Do not invest unless you are prepared to lose your entire investment. For a full disclaimer, please click here.\n\nThe crypto market is bullish as Bitcoin\u2019s price rises to $42K, its highest in nine days.\n\nThis has generated notable excitement among market participants, leading many to seek high-potential altcoins that could outpace the market leader.\n\nWith that in mind, this article considers the top five cryptos to buy now. We examine expert opinions, use cases, tokenomics, price, emerging market narratives, and more.\n\nBitcoin Minerix\n\nInvestors who like to invest in robust fundamentals will be pleased to learn of our top pick, Bitcoin Minetrix. The project leverages an innovative Stake-to-Mine mechanism, breaking down the socio-economic barriers to entry for Bitcoin mining.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix lets users cloud mine Bitcoin by staking $BTCMTX on its Ethereum-based platform. It works by users staking $BTCMTX in exchange for Bitcoin mining credits. They can then burn these credits for cloud mining power, translating to free Bitcoin.\n\nThe process does not demand technical expertise or expensive hardware, making it ideal for beginners and those looking for an effortless way to mine Bitcoin. Consequently, Bitcoin Minetrix is attracting the masses, contributing to massive $BTCMTX demand.\n\nMeanwhile, the $BTCMTCX supply is scarce since many tokens will be locked in the staking contract, and rewards are primarily paid in mining credits, not $BTCMTX.\n\nAnother advantage to Bitcoin Minetrix is the decentralized and transparent nature of $BTCMTX, which eradicates the risk of cloud mining scams, making the project a more secure alternative to existing solutions.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix is currently undergoing a presale, having raised $9.5 million so far.\n\nThe current price is $0.0131, but this will incrementally rise throughout the presale, with the next hike occurring in three days.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nSponge\n\nSponge is a SpongeBob SquarePants-inspired meme coin that has recently enjoyed monumental success. Currently priced at $0.0006831, the price is up 1.1% today, 71% this month, and over 500% since November.\n\nHowever, a recent pullback renders it 32% down this week, presenting a timely entry point for new buyers.\n\nThe reason for the project\u2019s overarching success is that the team recently announced the Sponge token will bridge to Sponge V2, which is packed with new utility and tokenomics.\n\nSponge V2 boasts a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game, enabling users to earn crypto while furthering the token\u2019s demand potential.\n\nThe game boasts a free and paid version, with the paid version requiring users to buy credits with $SPONGEV2 to earn extra rewards.\n\nSponge V2 is undergoing a prelaunch \u201cStake to Bridge\u201d campaign. This is where existing Sponge holders must stake their tokens on the Sponge.vip website for an equivalent amount of V2. Based on a variable APY, the staked tokens will also incur an additional staking yield.\n\nNew investors can buy Sponge V2 directly from the Sponge.vip website. The purchase will be locked in the staking contract until the campaign ends, compounding with the additional staking yield.\n\nVisit Sponge.vip Website\n\nMeme Kombat\n\nThe meme coin trend has become one of crypto\u2019s most vocal narratives in recent months, with countless projects making 10-100x gains. Meme Kombat is a pioneering crypto that compresses the virality of all other meme coins into one P2E project.\n\nIt features AI-generated battles between meme coin characters, which users can bet on with the $MK token.\n\nFights will occur in Meme Kombat\u2019s augmented battle arena, where users can watch and wager from their front-row seats.\n\nStaking is another weapon in Meme Kombat\u2019s arsenal, letting users lock up their tokens for a generous yield. The current APY is 124%, but this will decrease as the staking pool grows.\n\nAnalyst Austin Hilton believes Meme Kombat\u2019s unique use case could capture a massive user base. According to the analyst, members of different meme coin communities could converge on the app to support their respective projects.\n\nTo add an element of competitiveness, Meme Kombat offers various game modes, including multiplayer, single-player, and side betting.\n\nMeme Kombat is currently undergoing a presale, having raised over $7.5 million so far. But with a hard cap of just $10 million, time is running out for investors to secure $MK at its current discounted presale rate.\n\nVisit Meme Kombat Presale\n\neTukTuk\n\neTukTuk is another presale offering a market-leading use case, tackling one of the world\u2019s most prevalent issues: climate change.\n\nThe project will provide developing nations with electric \u201ctuk-tuk\u201d vehicles, equipping them with cutting-edge AI integrations and leveraging blockchain technology to maximize efficiency, environmental benefits, and vehicle longevity.\n\neTukTuk\u2019s native token, $TUK, transfers value throughout the ecosystem, providing a clear use case and demand stream.\n\nAdding to its robust tokenomic structure is its staking mechanism, incentivizing long-term holding, thereby limiting the token\u2019s sell pressure.\n\nIts whitepaper also mentions \u201cbanking the unbanked,\u201d providing access to the modern financial world to those in developing nations. It is also built on the BNB chain for scalability and low-cost transacting.\n\nThe project will also offer electric vehicle charging stations and aims to become self-sustainable from local power grids.\n\nMeanwhile, it utilizes cutting-edge AI technology to optimize \u201croutes for reduced traffic and minimal fuel consumption, promoting sustainable transport.\u201d\n\nIt will also use AI for predictive maintenance to maximize vehicle longevity, ensuring minimal waste and an efficient use of resources.\n\neTukTuk is undergoing a presale, having raised $580K so far. However, the price will rise in three days, so investors must act fast.\n\nVisit eTukTuk Presale\n\nInternet Computer\n\nInternet Computer is a well-established yet somewhat emerging cryptocurrency, launched in 2021 but currently undergoing a notable resurgence after a strong macro selloff.\n\nICP holds a $5.6 billion market cap, priced at $12.44, with a $6.3 billion FDV. The ICP price is up 5.06% today, 12.01% this week, 27% this month, and 111% this year.\n\nIts recent performance is particularly impressive given the challenging market conditions and the fact most other top 20 cryptos remain in the red across the last seven days.\n\nInternet Computer offers a compelling use case; although it is a layer one blockchain, it looks beyond the capabilities of networks like Ethereum and Solana and aims to challenge the broader legacy internet model.\n\nAccording to its website, Internet Computer offers a cloudless, open internet that gives users complete control and autonomy.\n\nIt breaks the mold of traditional blockchain solutions, opting for a consensus mechanism best described as Proof-of-Useful-Work. This includes staking and slashing, and value is transferred through its ecosystem with the ICP coin.\n\nOne prominent issue that Internet Computer addresses is that blockchain relies on traditional IT, which it claims is susceptible to kill switches and back doors that deny users true sovereignty."

        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies showed mixed trading on Sunday evening as traders monitored the inflows into the recently launched Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and anticipated the Bitcoin halving in April.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD +0.66% $42,201 Ethereum ETH/USD -0.75% $2,,265 Dogecoin DOGE/USD -1.99% $0.078\n\nWhat Happened: Bitcoin has shown a steady upward trend over the weekend, suggesting sustained interest from bullish investors.\n\nOn Monday, Google is reportedly poised to implement updated policies that will permit the advertising of certain cryptocurrency products on the major search engine. The revision is expected to open the doors for the promotion of Bitcoin and exchange-traded funds.\n\nGoogle will revise its advertising policy to accommodate ads from \u201cadvertisers offering Cryptocurrency Coin Trust targeting the United States.\u201d\n\nAccording to data presented by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart on Jan. 26, the assets under management of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) have surpassed the $2 billion milestone.\n\nOn Thursday, investors infused approximately $170 million into IBIT, leading to the acquisition of nearly 4,300 Bitcoin. Consequently, the total tokens held by the fund surged to 49,952, coinciding with the surge in the price of bitcoin, which escalated beyond the $40,000 mark early Friday.\n\nThis growth elevated the assets under management (AUM) to over $2 billion. Notably, with AUM surpassing $2 billion, IBIT now ranks as the third highest in asset accumulation among the 600 ETFs launched in the past year.\n\nThe next fund anticipated to exceed the $2 billion threshold is Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which as of Jan.25, held just under 44,000 bitcoin.\n\nTop Gainer (24 Hour)\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EDT) Conflux CRYPTO: CFX) +9.27% $0.24 Injective INJ/USD +5.16% $37.29 Flare FLR/USD +4.49% $0.022\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.56 trillion, showing a 0.48% increase in the past 24 hours.\n\nU.S. stock futures experienced a broad decline Sunday night as Wall Street prepared for the release of several mega-cap tech earnings reports and the Federal Reserve's rate policy decision. Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 86 points, or 0.2%. Similarly, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures saw decreases of 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.\n\nIn the previous trading week, all three major averages recorded gains following positive economic data. The fourth-quarter economic growth surpassed expectations, while the core inflation rate on a yearly basis was lower than anticipated, indicating a potential slowdown in price increases. However, the market's gains were more subdued compared to the previous week\u2019s surge, attributed to disappointing earnings reports from notable companies such as Intel and Tesla.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to commence its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Market observers are highly confident that the central bank will maintain stable rates. Traders involved in the Fed funds futures market have assigned an almost 97% probability that the Fed will not cut rates at the upcoming meeting, according to the CME Group.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe has suggested that Bitcoin is likely to consolidate within the range of $37,000 to $48,000 in the months ahead.\n\n\"In this period, Altcoins will have their time. The real impact on the ETF is going to come in the next few years, resulting into a price of Bitcoin going to $300,000-500,000.\"\n\nCrypto analyst Benjamin Cowen predicts a significant correction for Ethereum, anticipating a sharp decline to below the $1,000 mark.\n\n\"What I'm suggesting is that sometime in the next few months, ETH/BTC breaks down. After ETH/BTC breaks down, ETH/USD breaks down. One of the things about ETH/USD that you might notice is that it doesn't tend to just put in a low and then never test the integrity of that low. Look at all the prior examples\u2026 So at some point, I think Ethereum will test the integrity of that low, back down below $1,000. But, history would also suggest that it won't test it until after ETH/BTC breaks down. And history also suggests that ETH/BTC probably won't break down in January because normally January is a good month for Ethereum.\"\n\nOn-chain analytics firm Santiment reported that Bitcoin has surpassed the $42K mark, while altcoins have not yet followed suit. Interestingly, the SP500 achieved a new all-time highs just yesterday, fueling the bullish argument for crypto.\n\nPhoto by Matt Benzero on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Jim Cramer Advises Against Using Binance, Provokes Strong Reactions From Twitter Users"

        "content": "The tides seem to be turning in favor of the Bitcoin price, as the market leader has reclaimed the $42,000 level for the second time in as many days. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency has managed to register a 1.1% profit on the weekly timeframe.\n\nWhile Bitcoin appears to be garnering positive momentum at the moment, outflows from the Grayscale BTC ETF (GBTC) continue to brew fear of continued bearish pressure in the hearts of investors. However, a prominent crypto analyst has offered insights into the flagship coin\u2019s recent movement, claiming that the price correction is over.\n\nBTC Price To Make Another Run At $48,000?\n\nIn his latest video on YouTube, crypto pundit and analyst Michael van de Poppe declared that he believes that the Bitcoin price correction is over for now. The premier cryptocurrency experienced an almost 10% price decline after notching a multi-month high at around $49,000 on January 11, the day Bitcoin spot ETFs started trading in the United States.\n\nWhile the general belief is that this price dip is connected to investors cashing out their shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, van de Poppe claims that it is only one of the negative events that enter the spotlight when the market is going through a correction. The analyst also highlighted the recent news of Mt. Gox paying out approximately 200,000 BTC to its past clients as another such incident.\n\nHowever, with the selling pressure somewhat dampening, de Poppe speculated that the Bitcoin price might have one more run to $48,000 before the halving event. While acknowledging that the Bitcoin halving is a bullish event, the analyst doesn\u2019t believe there would be a significant price rally prior to it.\n\nIn line with his analysis, Michael van de Poppe expects the Bitcoin price action to be within a range of $37,000 \u2013 48,000 over the coming months. The crypto analyst anticipates that the altcoins will go on a positive run during this period.\n\nFinally, van de Poppe mentioned that a trip down to $30,000 is not completely off the cards for the market leader, echoing recent bearish predictions. However, the pundit believes the odds of a $30,000 retest are low, as the crypto market rarely moves in the crowd\u2019s direction.\n\nBitcoin Price Update\n\nAs of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at $42,124, reflecting a mere 0.7% increase in the past day. With a market capitalization of over $826 billion, BTC maintains its position as the largest cryptocurrency in the sector.\n\nBitcoin price breaks above the $42,000 mark on the daily timeframe | Source: BTCUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chat from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with a resurgence in Solana-related tokens, as numerous coins witness remarkable overnight gains. This uptrend has not gone unnoticed by major crypto exchanges and is attributed to several factors, including positive market trends and the noteworthy surge of Solana (SOL). The question on everyone\u2019s mind: Why is the price of Solana experiencing an upswing? SOL Price could increase massively in the upcoming days and price could 3x in the next few months. It seems like the crypto community is eagerly seeking answers as they ride the wave of excitement in the Solana ecosystem. Let\u2019s take a look at this in Solana price prediction article in more detail.\n\nSolana Price Prediction: How has the SOL Price moved in recent days?\n\nSolana (SOL) is throwing a digital party, flaunting a current price tag of $97.29. It\u2019s not just a number; it is strutting with a 24-hour trading volume of $4.87 billion and a market cap of $42.16 billion, scoring a 2.57% spot in the market equilibrium. And guess what? In the last 24 hours, SOL cranked up the excitement by 5.04% increase.\n\nSolana hit its peak on November 6, 2021, reaching a stellar $259.52. But, hold on, rewind to May 11, 2020 \u2013 SOL at its lowest, was hanging out at $0.503701.\n\nNow, the big question \u2013 what\u2019s the vibe in the Solana community? The price prediction is keeping it chill at neutral, and the Fear & Greed Index is sitting at a balanced 54 (Neutral).\n\nIn terms of tokens, Solana has about 433.38 million SOL out of a max supply of 533.68 million SOL. They\u2019re making more SOL at a rate of 19.42% per year, creating around 70.47 million SOL in the last year. In the crypto charts, Solana is rocking the #2 spot in Proof-of-Stake Coins, #2 in the Solana Network, and a solid #4 in the Layer 1 scene.\n\nSolana Price Prediction: SOL Price To Reach $300?\n\nReason 1: Solana Ecosystem\n\nSolana (SOL) has been quite the crypto superstar, pulling off an impressive 305% surge in its price over the last year. This stellar growth places Solana in the upper echelons, outshining 93% of the top 100 crypto assets in the same timeframe.\n\nNotably, Solana hasn\u2019t just outpaced the heavyweights Bitcoin and Ethereum; it\u2019s currently cruising above the 200-day simple moving average, signaling a sustained positive vibe. Adding to its charm, Solana\u2019s performance isn\u2019t just about the market; it has outshone its token sale price, making it a pretty sweet investment. With a robust market cap, Solana stands tall with high liquidity, making it a noteworthy player in the ever-evolving crypto universe.\n\nIn the intricate world of technical analysis, Solana finds itself at a pivotal crossroads. The weekly pivot point, a crucial marker set at $105, stands as a guiding signal for potential future price actions.\n\nAs we cast our gaze upwards, Solana encounters immediate resistance at $110, marking a significant hurdle. Beyond this point, notable levels of resistance emerge at $116 and $124, adding layers to the intricate dance of price dynamics. The coming moves of Solana in this intricate choreography will certainly be of keen interest to those navigating the crypto charts. If SOL successfully pass these barriaers then it has the potential to reach $300 before Bitcoin halving.\n\nReason 2: Solana ETF\n\nThe green light for spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11 has ignited optimism within the industry, sparking speculation that other cryptocurrencies, Solana included, may follow suit in securing a spot ETF in the future.\n\nAdding fuel to the Solana ETF speculation is Franklin Templeton, a trillion-dollar asset management firm, which commended the blockchain for its strides in decentralized finance, infrastructure, nonfungible token innovation, and the vibrant world of memecoins. Notably, the company is already in the ETF game, offering a spot Bitcoin ETF product under the ticker (EZBC). The evolving landscape of ETFs in the crypto space continues to be a hot topic, with eyes on the potential inclusion of various digital assets.\n\nImagine the crypto world buzzing with excitement as folks eagerly anticipate the possibility of a Solana ETF. The talk of the town suggests that if this gets the regulatory nod, it could be the spark that sends SOL prices soaring high. It\u2019s like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to the time when Bitcoin went on a wild rally ahead of its own ETF approval. The feeling in the market is that we might just see a similar surge for Solana.\n\nReason 3: Inverse Correlation With USD\n\nAnticipations are running high that a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve could act as a tailwind propelling Solana prices even higher in the months ahead. According to the CME\u2019s Fed futures fund rate projections, there\u2019s a significant 59.5% probability of a 25 basis point interest rate cut in the United States by March 2024. Considering Solana\u2019s consistent inverse correlation with the U.S. dollar, this dovish outlook from the Fed might just be the catalyst needed for SOL to embark on a substantial rally by March. The intricate dance between crypto and macroeconomic factors continues, adding an extra layer of intrigue to the crypto narrative.\n\nBuy Cryptocurrency with Bitget with the CHEAPEST Fees\n\nBitget stands out as a reliable crypto exchange. It provides a user-friendly interface, making it easy for both beginners and experienced traders to navigate and make transactions at the lowest fees on the market. To get started with Bitget, you need to create an account, complete the necessary KYC procedures, and then you can begin trading a variety of altcoins available on the platform.\n\n\u2014> Click here to buy cryptocurrencies<\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also like\n\nMore from Altcoin"

        "content": "It\u2019s only been a month into 2024, and Bitcoin has already experienced a whirlwind of activity. These events range from the SEC\u2019s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs to the cryptocurrency\u2019s price underperforming with a decrease over the past month and selloffs from the Grayscale BTC Trust. Amidst all these, on-chain data has revealed an interesting sentiment of strategic accumulation among whales of the largest cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to information provided by crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin whales have added over 76,000 BTC worth approximately $3 billion to their holdings since the beginning of the year.\n\nBitcoin whales have increased their $BTC holdings by ~$3B (76,000 BTC) sine the start of this year. pic.twitter.com/0hi3Q7WXEo \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 27, 2024\n\nBitcoin Whales Increase Holdings By $3 Billion Despite Market Downturn\n\nThe price of Bitcoin climbed shortly after the approval of spot ETFs in the US to reach a 20-month high of $48,600. However, in a surprising turn of events, the crypto has suffered a price dip, reaching as low as $38,880 during the week.\n\nDespite this series of events, on-chain data suggests that the selloff is coming mostly from small-term holders and a few large whales, as the majority of whales have been taking advantage of the price dip to scoop up more Bitcoin into their wallets.\n\nThe total balance among Bitcoin whales has jumped by 76,000 in January, with the count now nearing 7.8 million BTC. Consequently, addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC have now reached a new all-time high.\n\nDespite the negative price movement, Bitcoin held in addresses with over 1,000 BTC has reached a new yearly high! pic.twitter.com/4qQhbXSD9S \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 26, 2024\n\nPrice Surge Incoming?\n\nBTC\u2019s future price outlook looks unclear at the moment, as the crypto is currently trading at a minor resistance around the $42,000 level. According to analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, Bitcoin could continue consolidating between $37,000 and $48,000 for the coming months, giving altcoins a time to shine.\n\nBTC is currently trading at $42,522. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nHowever, fundamentals surrounding Bitcoin point to a price growth in the longer term. Renowned economist Peter Schiff recently commented that Bitcoin has the possibility of surging to $10 million within the next decade if it becomes a hedge against the devaluation of the US dollar.\n\nThe community and investors also like to keep an eye out for crypto whales because they can significantly influence price movements. When whales stock up on BTC, it often signals they believe the price is undervalued and ready to rise substantially in the near future.\n\nIf the whale accumulation continues, it could lead to a change to positive sentiment among the wider Bitcoin investing market. The next Bitcoin halving is also on its way, and many analysts predict a price growth around the event.\n\nFeatured image from Pexels\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The prolonged stagnation led skeptics to anticipate a potential decline in BTC\u2019s value. In the short term, miners may contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s correction.\n\nMiners play it safe\n\nApproaching the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving, a shift was observed in the Bitcoin mining sector.\n\nRecent data indicated a substantial decrease in miners\u2019 Bitcoin reserves, accompanied by an increase in BTC transfers to exchanges. The flow from miners to exchanges surpassed exchanges to miners by threefold, signaling significant selling pressure from the mining community.\n\nThe rationale behind miners liquidating their reserves is strategic.\n\nTypically, miners capitalize on profits before a halving event to cover operational expenses and facilitate future investments. This strategy becomes increasingly crucial as competition in Bitcoin mining escalates with each halving, where the block reward is halved, reducing miners\u2019 income unless the Bitcoin price rises proportionally.\n\nTo stay competitive, miners must invest in advanced, more efficient mining equipment and technologies. Liquidating a portion of their Bitcoin reserves provides the capital necessary for these strategic investments.\n\nThis trend is of paramount importance for investors and market analysts to monitor, as heightened selling pressure from miners could impact the coin\u2019s short-term price.\n\nMiners Selling Bitcoin Reserves Ahead of Halving \u2013 A Strategic Move \u201cIn fact, the flow of #Bitcoin from miners to exchanges is now three times higher than the movement from exchanges to miners.

Users can collateralize BTC to BitSmileyDAO and mint BitUSD. When the value of the collateral falls below a set threshold, a liquidation process will be initiated, adopting the Dutch auction model. Unlike MakerDAO, bitSmiley auctions the future income of the platform as a debt and repays the creditors first. In addition, BitUSD has adopted a new bitRC20 inscription format that is compatible with BRC-20.\n\nIn addition to stablecoins, bitSmiley has also developed DeFi products tailored for BTC characteristics, such as lending and insurance. Peer-to-peer native lending based on bitRC20 can help BTC users achieve lending functions similar to Compound and AAVE. Additionally, bitSmiley has introduced a no-liquidation lending insurance mechanism, where borrowers can choose to buy insurance when collateral prices drop.\n\nOKX Ventures Founder Dora Yue said: \"Bitcoin, as the cornerstone of the crypto field, has strong value consensus and security but lacks programmability and scalability. This limits its applications in the DeFi field. By leveraging the BRC-20 protocol and Ordinals technology, bitSmiley expands Bitcoin\u2019s possibilities, enabling users to enjoy various financial services such as stablecoin, lending, derivatives, etc. on the Bitcoin network, while maintaining Bitcoin's security and decentralization. bitSmiley, which was recognized as an excellent project at the BTC Hackathon co-hosted by ABCDE and OKX Ventures in November last year, demonstrated its strength in technical innovation and product design. We are committed to discovering and cultivating excellent projects in the crypto space, providing users with more choices and opportunities, providing more support and impetus for the industry, and adding more value to the society. bitSmiley is our important investment in the BTC ecosystem, and we believe it will bring more vitality and reform to Bitcoin.\"\n\nTo learn more about bitSmiley, click here .\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nMedia@okx.com\n\nAbout OKX Ventures\n\nOKX Ventures is the investment arm of leading crypto exchange and Web3 technology company OKX, with an initial capital commitment of USD 100 million.

        "title": "Bitcoin Halving: Examining its Historical Impact on Price - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The Bitcoin Halving Effect: Unraveling Historical Price Dynamics and Market Impact\n\nBitcoin halving, a programmed event that occurs approximately every four years, is a critical aspect of the cryptocurrency monetary policy. This article delves into the concept of Bitcoin halving, explores its historical occurrences, and analyzes the impact it has had on the price and overall market dynamics of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Halving:\n\nBitcoin halving is an event designed to control the supply of new bitcoins entering circulation. It occurs approximately every 210,000 blocks, reducing the reward miners receive for validating transactions by half. The aim is to limit the total supply of bitcoins to 21 million, introducing scarcity and influencing market dynamics.\n\nHistorical Bitcoin Halving Events:\n\nBitcoin has experienced three halving events to date, in 2012, 2016, and 2020. Each event has had a profound impact on the cryptocurrency ecosystem, influencing miner incentives, investor sentiment, and overall market behavior.\n\nImpact on Mining Economics:\n\nBitcoin halving significantly affects the economics of Bitcoin mining. With the reduction in block rewards, miners face diminished revenues, prompting adjustments in their operations. This event introduces a level of unpredictability to the mining sector, as miners need to adapt to the changing reward structure.\n\nMarket Price Trends:\n\nHistorical data suggests that Bitcoin halving events have been associated with notable price trends. In the months following a halving, Bitcoin has experienced both short-term volatility and long-term price appreciation. The reduced supply coupled with sustained demand has historically contributed to upward price movements.\n\nHype and Speculation:\n\nBitcoin halving events often generate hype and speculation within the cryptocurrency community and beyond. Anticipation of potential price increases drives market sentiment, leading to increased trading activity and heightened attention from investors and the media.\n\nLong-Term Implications:\n\nWhile short-term price movements are common after a halving, the long-term implications are of equal importance. The reduced rate of new bitcoin issuance introduces a deflationary aspect to Bitcoin, aligning with its digital gold narrative and appealing to investors seeking a store of value.\n\nPost-2020 Halving Landscape:\n\nThe most recent Bitcoin halving in 2020 saw increased institutional interest, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a viable asset class. The post-halving period witnessed significant price appreciation, and Bitcoin continued to gain recognition as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBitcoin halving events are pivotal moments in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, impacting mining economics, investor sentiment, and market dynamics. As Bitcoin continues to mature, the historical patterns observed around halving events provide valuable insights into the potential trajectory of the cryptocurrency\u2019s price. While past performance is not indicative of future results, understanding the historical impact of Bitcoin halving events remains a crucial aspect for market participants and enthusiasts alike.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "How to Buy Bitcoin with AMEX: A Step-by-Step Guide - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Here is a guide to buying Bitcoin with an AMEX Card\n\nBitcoin is the world\u2019s most popular and valuable cryptocurrency, having a market value of more than US$1 trillion as of January 2024. Many people are interested in buying Bitcoin as an investment, a hedge against inflation, or a way to participate in the decentralized digital economy. However, buying Bitcoin can be challenging, especially if you want to use your American Express (AMEX) card.\n\nAMEX is one of the largest and most reputable credit card companies in the world, with over 100 million cardholders worldwide. However, AMEX does not offer any direct crypto trading services through its website or app. This means that you cannot buy Bitcoin directly from AMEX, but you have to use a third-party platform that supports AMEX as a payment method.\n\nBuying Bitcoin with AMEX on Crypto Exchanges\n\nCrypto exchanges are the most common and convenient way to buy Bitcoin with your AMEX card. However, not all crypto exchanges accept AMEX as a payment method, and some may charge high fees or have low limits for AMEX transactions. Therefore, you need to do some research and compare different crypto exchanges before choosing one.\n\nOne of the best crypto exchanges that accept AMEX as a payment method is OKX. It is a leading global crypto exchange that offers over 400 trading pairs, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and many more. OKX also supports various payment methods, such as credit cards, bank transfers, and e-wallets. OKX has a partnership with Sardine, a payment processor that enables AMEX cardholders to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on OKX.\n\nTo buy Bitcoin with your AMEX card on OKX, you need to follow these steps:\n\nCreate an account on OKX and verify your identity.\n\nGo to the Buy Crypto page and select Credit Card as the payment method.\n\nChoose AMEX as the card type and enter the amount of Bitcoin you want to buy.\n\nYou will be redirected to Sardine\u2019s website, where you need to enter your AMEX card details and complete the payment.\n\nYou will receive your Bitcoin in your OKX wallet within minutes.\n\nBuying Bitcoin with AMEX on Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces.\n\nPeer-to-peer marketplaces are another option to buy Bitcoin with your AMEX card. However, this option is less secure and more expensive than using a crypto exchange.\n\nTo buy Bitcoin with your AMEX card on Paxful, you need to follow these steps:\n\nCreate an account with Paxful and authenticate your identity.\n\nGo to the Buy Bitcoin page and look for offers that accept AMEX as the payment method.\n\nChoose an offer that suits your needs and open a trade with the seller.\n\nFollow the seller\u2019s instructions and send the payment with your AMEX card.\n\nConfirm the payment and wait for the seller to release the Bitcoin from the escrow.\n\nYou will receive your Bitcoin in your Paxful wallet within minutes.\n\nConclusion\n\nBuying Bitcoin with your AMEX card is possible, but not easy. You need to use a third-party platform that supports AMEX as a payment method and compare different options based on fees, limits, security, and convenience. Crypto exchanges are the most common and convenient way to buy Bitcoin with your AMEX card, but not all of them accept AMEX.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Bitcoin and Institutional Adoption: Navigating the Future Financial Frontier In 2024\n\nBitcoin, the pioneer of cryptocurrency, has seen a notable shift in recent years with increased interest and adoption by institutional players. This article explores the evolving relationship between Bitcoin and institutional investors, examining the factors driving this adoption, the impact on the cryptocurrency landscape, and what the future may hold for Bitcoin integration into the mainstream financial system.\n\nRising Institutional Interest:\n\nThe past few years have witnessed a surge in institutional interest in Bitcoin. Renowned financial institutions, investment firms, and corporations have started to recognize Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, signaling a departure from earlier skepticism.\n\nInstitutional Drivers for Adoption:\n\nVarious factors contribute to institutional adoption, including the desire for portfolio diversification, the search for uncorrelated assets, and the potential for Bitcoin as a store of value and hedge against inflation. As institutional investors seek alternative assets, Bitcoin emerges as a viable option with its finite supply and decentralized nature.\n\nBitcoin as a Store of Value:\n\nThe narrative of Bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold\u201d has gained traction among institutional investors. The finite supply of 21 million bitcoins and its decentralized nature position Bitcoin as a potential store of value comparable to traditional safe-haven assets like gold.\n\nImpact on Market Dynamics:\n\nInstitutional involvement has brought about significant changes in market dynamics. Increased liquidity, reduced volatility, and a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate investment have become defining features of the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nRegulatory Developments:\n\nRegulatory clarity and frameworks have become key determinants in institutional adoption. As governments and regulatory bodies provide clearer guidelines for cryptocurrency investments, institutions are gaining confidence in navigating the regulatory landscape surrounding Bitcoin.\n\nFinancial Infrastructure:\n\nThe development of robust financial infrastructure, including regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, custody solutions, and institutional-grade trading platforms, has played a crucial role in facilitating institutional entry into the Bitcoin market. This infrastructure addresses concerns related to security, compliance, and ease of trading.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities:\n\nWhile institutional adoption brings credibility and liquidity to the cryptocurrency market, challenges such as regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, and the need for standardized custodial solutions persist. Navigating these challenges presents opportunities for collaboration between the cryptocurrency industry and traditional financial institutions.\n\nThe Future Outlook:\n\nLooking ahead, the future of Bitcoin and institutional adoption appears promising. Continued regulatory clarity, advancements in financial infrastructure, and ongoing efforts to enhance Bitcoin\u2019s scalability and sustainability contribute to a positive outlook for institutional involvement in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBitcoin\u2019s journey from the fringes of finance to the institutional spotlight marks a significant paradigm shift. As institutions increasingly recognize the value and potential of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency landscape is undergoing transformative changes. The future holds the promise of deeper integration, increased acceptance, and a more diversified financial ecosystem where Bitcoin plays a pivotal role alongside traditional assets.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

The potential approval of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has been a hot topic within the cryptocurrency community. This article delves into the hypothetical scenario of Bitcoin ETF approval and explores the potential impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price trends, market dynamics, and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin ETF Approval:\n\nA Bitcoin ETF would essentially enable traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. The approval of such an ETF could signify increased acceptance and legitimacy of Bitcoin in traditional financial markets.\n\nHistorical Context of ETF Speculation:\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has historically been influenced by speculation surrounding the approval or disapproval of a Bitcoin ETF by regulatory bodies. Examining past instances of ETF speculation provides insights into how the market has reacted to similar anticipation.\n\nPotential Positive Impact on Prices:\n\nProponents argue that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF could lead to increased demand from institutional and retail investors, potentially driving up the price of Bitcoin. The ease of access and regulatory oversight associated with an ETF could attract a broader range of investors to the cryptocurrency.\n\nMarket Volatility and Short-Term Fluctuations:\n\nWhile the long-term impact could be positive, short-term market dynamics may involve increased volatility. Traders and investors may react swiftly to ETF-related news, leading to price fluctuations and trading opportunities.\n\nInstitutional Inflow and Liquidity Boost:\n\nApproval of a Bitcoin ETF could pave the way for more institutional investment. Increased institutional participation could bring higher liquidity to the Bitcoin market, reducing the impact of large trades on price and fostering a more stable trading environment.\n\nBroader Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Impact:\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF could have a spillover effect on the broader cryptocurrency market. Positive sentiment and increased investment in Bitcoin may spill over into other cryptocurrencies, influencing their prices and market dynamics.\n\nRegulatory Considerations:\n\nThe regulatory landscape plays a crucial role in the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF. Understanding regulatory considerations and potential outcomes is essential for predicting how the market might react to different regulatory decisions.\n\nMarket Adaptation and Investor Sentiment:\n\nHow the market adapts to the approval of a Bitcoin ETF will be influenced by investor sentiment. Positive sentiment could lead to a sustained bull market, while negative sentiment may result in a short-lived price surge followed by a correction.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe hypothetical scenario of a Bitcoin ETF approval presents an intriguing lens through which to analyze potential shifts in Bitcoin\u2019s price trends and market dynamics. While it holds promise for increased institutional involvement and market stability, the cryptocurrency landscape remains inherently unpredictable. Understanding historical patterns, regulatory considerations, and the broader implications on the cryptocurrency ecosystem is crucial for investors navigating the ever-evolving world of Bitcoin.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
