        "title": "Will Bitcoin Go Up or Down? Illinois Tech Professor Mines Data for Answers - IIT Today",
        "content": "Buy, sell, or hold? Since its launch in 2009 as the first cryptocurrency, the value of bitcoin has been a financial roller coaster ride with lofty peaks and precipitous drops. Given this history of volatility, is there any way that investors with bitcoin in their portfolios\u2014or those who are considering adding it\u2014can anticipate where this crypto is headed next?\n\nAssociate Professor of Finance Sang Baum Kang at Illinois Institute of Technology\u2019s Stuart School of Business is co-author of a paper published in The Journal of Alternative Investments that provides new empirical evidence about bitcoin returns to guide investment professionals, economists, and academic researchers.\n\n\u201cWhat Information Variables Predict Bitcoin Returns? A Dimension-Reduction Approach\u201d details research conducted by Kang and two of his former doctoral students\u2014Yao Xie (M.S. Finance \u201915, Ph.D. MSC \u201921), an associate quantitative analyst at Morningstar Inc., and Jialin Zhao (Stuart Ph.D. MSC \u201917), associate professor of quantitative management at St. Mary\u2019s University in San Antonio.\n\nAccording to Kang, Xie, and Zhao, bitcoin has straddled three different economic roles over time: as a type of currency, due to its use as a medium of payment; as a speculative security; and as a safe-haven commodity because of its scarcity and mining cost.\n\n\u201cIn academia, there is a research methodology called the asset return predictability study,\u201d says Kang. \u201cAn underlying principle is that variables predicting the future movement of an asset price may be important in the economic system. So understanding what those variables are is important not only to traders who want to take a position in bitcoin, but also to economists who want to understand the nature of bitcoin.\u201d\n\nUtilizing cutting-edge predictive analytics techniques and dimension-reduction models with a dataset covering January 2011 to January 2020, the research team focused on a comprehensive set of 25 information variables under five categories\u2014macroeconomics, blockchain technology, other assets, stress level, and investor sentiment\u2014to identify factors that impact bitcoin returns.\n\n\u201cWe find that blockchain technology, investor sentiment, and stress level have predictive power for bitcoin returns,\u201d Kang says. \u201cSimilar to traditional assets, bitcoin shows higher return predictability with longer return horizons. These findings support the dual nature of bitcoin as a technical artifact and speculative asset.\u201d\n\nMajor results of the research include:\n\n\u2022 The difficulty of mining bitcoin positively predicts returns, which supports the theory that as blockchain technology requirements increase, the supply of bitcoin is reduced, which in turn increases the return on bitcoin.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin returns are positively driven by investor sentiment\u2014that is, the general attitude about bitcoin and the market. When investor sentiment goes up, so does bitcoin, indicating the speculative nature of bitcoin as an asset.\n\n\u2022 Future bitcoin returns decrease when there is an increased stress level, or financial turmoil in the economy, which points to the risks associated with holding bitcoin as an asset.\n\nIn addition, the research demonstrates that macroeconomic variables\u2014such as measures of business conditions, monetary policy, and inflation\u2014and returns on commodities, securities, and other assets do not predict bitcoin returns well.\n\n\u201cBitcoin returns are largely detached from economic fundamentals,\u201d Kang says. \u201cFrom this finding, we caution against using bitcoin as a diversifier or safe-haven asset within an investment portfolio.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Associate Professor of Finance Sang Baum \u201cSolomon\u201d Kang"

        "title": "What's the Future of Bitcoin? Here Are the Best, Worst, and Most Likely Scenarios. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC 1.17%) is many things, but you can never call it boring. The oldest, largest, and most mature cryptocurrency is still finding its sea legs in the market, rolling through roughly equal amounts of good news and bad.\n\nThe road ahead is as murky as ever. As I write this, Bitcoin's market price stands 62% below the all-time high of November 2021. At the same time, Bitcoin has tripled in three years and gained 1,500% in six years. About half the value of the total crypto market comes from Bitcoin alone. So there are plenty of Bitcoin bulls out there, but also lots of bearish investors.\n\nSo where is Bitcoin headed in the long run? Let's consider the best of all possible outcomes, the ultimate bear case, and then find a more realistic middle ground between those extremes.\n\nA Bitcoin bonanza: The best-case scenario\n\nBitcoin maximalists, like MicroStrategy (MSTR 10.85%) chairman Michael Saylor, believe that Bitcoin is the future of money. He expects the price to go up \"forever,\" with some volatility along the way but a reliably positive trend in the long run. So MicroStrategy has converted most of its cash reserves into Bitcoin and keeps buying more whenever it finds more spare cash to invest. In Saylor's view, that's the only reasonable way to manage your company's cash in the long run.\n\nSo what will it take to fulfill Mr. Saylor's ultra-bullish dreams of massive price gains? Well, let's imagine a world where absolutely everything works out in Bitcoin's favor:\n\nGlobal adoption: From Starbucks SBUX -0.85% ) Tesla TSLA -4.54% ) Bought it with Bitcoin. That new electric car? Yep, Tesla charged me in Bitcoin.\n\nFrom Bought it with Bitcoin. That new electric car? Yep, Tesla charged me in Bitcoin. Government approval: Governments worldwide not only tolerate Bitcoin but actively promote its use, ushering in a new era of supportive regulations and acceptance. Since this is the tip-top ideal outcome, we'd even see most countries adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, like El Salvador did two years ago.\n\nGovernments worldwide not only tolerate Bitcoin but actively promote its use, ushering in a new era of supportive regulations and acceptance. Since this is the tip-top ideal outcome, we'd even see most countries adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, like El Salvador did two years ago. Technological triumph: Without abandoning its anti-inflationary ideals and fundamental philosophy of effective value storage, Bitcoin's technology evolves to enable faster, cheaper transactions. Its blockchain becomes as dependable and efficient as any payment processor. This giant step forward would make Bitcoin-powered cash register checkouts work better, too.\n\nWithout abandoning its anti-inflationary ideals and fundamental philosophy of effective value storage, Bitcoin's technology evolves to enable faster, cheaper transactions.

Investors of all shapes and sizes adopt this platform to protect and grow their long-lasting wealth.\n\nWall Street's titans, from to , start treating Bitcoin like a regular asset class, adding credibility and boosting demand. Investors of all shapes and sizes adopt this platform to protect and grow their long-lasting wealth. DeFi expansion: Given the successes listed above, Bitcoin would clearly become the bedrock of a flourishing DeFi ecosystem.\n\nNow, this hypothetical scenario paints a rosy picture indeed, but remember, it's the best case. We'll need a sprinkle of luck and a whole lot of development to get there. But hey, who doesn't love a good daydream?\n\nA total Bitcoin bust: The worst-case scenario\n\nOn the bearish side of the Bitcoin argument, many investors argue that this digital currency -- and all digital currencies -- are fundamentally worthless. For example, master investor and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.69%) (BRK.B 0.78%) CEO Warren Buffett has called Bitcoin \"rat poison squared.\"\n\nBuffett and like-minded critics see zero value in cryptocurrencies, so they expect the Bitcoin token to lose all of its value over time. This could happen in many different ways:\n\nGlobal ban: Governments worldwide unite against Bitcoin, effectively reducing its value to $0.00. The digital coin isn't worth anything if nobody can use, trade, or own it.\n\nGovernments worldwide unite against Bitcoin, effectively reducing its value to $0.00. The digital coin isn't worth anything if nobody can use, trade, or own it. Unplanned obsolescence: A new digital currency could emerge with superior technology, rendering Bitcoin obsolete overnight. The superior solution could bring tighter security, faster transactions, stronger privacy protections, or even lower energy consumption -- or maybe all of the above. Ouch!\n\nA new digital currency could emerge with superior technology, rendering Bitcoin obsolete overnight. The superior solution could bring tighter security, faster transactions, stronger privacy protections, or even lower energy consumption -- or maybe all of the above. Ouch! Catastrophic technical flaw: A major flaw could be discovered in Bitcoin's underlying technology, undermining the entire network's security. For example, the transaction system may turn out to be vulnerable to attacks by quantum computers. Whether anyone actually exploits the newfound security hole, the mere existence of it would make investors, consumers, governments, and businesses lose trust in Bitcoin. A sharp price drop won't be far behind.\n\nA major flaw could be discovered in Bitcoin's underlying technology, undermining the entire network's security.

Whether anyone actually exploits the newfound security hole, the mere existence of it would make investors, consumers, governments, and businesses lose trust in Bitcoin. A sharp price drop won't be far behind. Environmental impact: If Bitcoin's energy consumption continues to rise, it could draw more criticism and potential regulatory restrictions due to environmental concerns. If the complaints grow loud enough, Bitcoin could lose plenty of market trust and value this way.\n\nRemember, this scenario is as relentlessly pessimistic as the best-of-all-worlds discussion was shamelessly optimistic. The chances of these doom-and-gloom factors materializing are just as slim as all the pieces falling into place perfectly for a Bitcoin utopia. You should always pay attention to the potential risks of any investment, especially one as volatile and unpredictable as Bitcoin.\n\nBut the sky isn't falling on Bitcoin yet. So, with the most extreme possibilities out of the way, let's explore the more likely middle-ground for Bitcoin's future.\n\nThe middle road: The most realistic way forward\n\nThe extremely Utopian and dystopian reviews above are interesting thought experiments, not firm forecasts. In reality, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will surely see both good and bad news over the next few years. Digital currencies seem ready to reshape the financial markets on a global scale, but the road ahead looks rocky and packed with unexpected twists.\n\nSo here's what I see as a more realistic outlook for Bitcoin:\n\nRegulatory uncertainty: Governments worldwide are likely to continue grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Some will embrace Bitcoin and similar technologies, while others continue to impose restrictions. This tug-of-war may lead to periods of extreme volatility as the market reacts to regulatory news.\n\nGovernments worldwide are likely to continue grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Some will embrace Bitcoin and similar technologies, while others continue to impose restrictions. This tug-of-war may lead to periods of extreme volatility as the market reacts to regulatory news. Gradual adoption: More businesses and consumers will probably start using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but the pace of adoption will likely be gradual. Some companies might resist due to volatility risks, transaction costs, and regulatory concerns. Nevertheless, the trend toward greater acceptance seems inexorable.\n\nMore businesses and consumers will probably start using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but the pace of adoption will likely be gradual.

Competition from other cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin will likely face stiff competition from other cryptocurrencies. Some will offer faster transaction speeds, others come with lower fees, and a few should focus on enhanced privacy. While Bitcoin is by far the biggest fish in the crypto pond so far, it's far from the only one, and its long-term dominance is not guaranteed.\n\nBitcoin will likely face stiff competition from other cryptocurrencies. Some will offer faster transaction speeds, others come with lower fees, and a few should focus on enhanced privacy. While Bitcoin is by far the biggest fish in the crypto pond so far, it's far from the only one, and its long-term dominance is not guaranteed. Technical improvements: The Bitcoin network is likely to see further improvements, but these may be gradual and not without controversy. Remember, changes to the Bitcoin protocol require consensus among miners and node operators, which can be hard to achieve. For example, will Bitcoin ever move from Proof-of-Work validation to the less power-hungry Proof-of-Stake system, like Ethereum (ETH -1.97%) did in recent months? And if so, could Bitcoin still hold on to its lifetime cap of 21 million possible coins? And if not, rival coins might eventually use that foot in the door to topple Bitcoin from the crypto throne.\n\nThe Bitcoin network is likely to see further improvements, but these may be gradual and not without controversy. Remember, changes to the Bitcoin protocol require consensus among miners and node operators, which can be hard to achieve. Continued volatility: Bitcoin's price is likely to remain volatile, with significant price swings being the norm rather than the exception. This volatility might decrease as the market matures, but expect roller-coaster rides in the meantime.\n\nIn conclusion, while Bitcoin's future is uncertain, it's likely to be somewhere between the extremes of becoming the world's dominant form of money or disappearing entirely.\n\nMany years down the road, cryptocurrencies should become as uncontroversial as stocks, bonds, or savings accounts, with solid and consistent legal and regulatory rulebooks in every country. But that future is a long way away from 2023 and nobody knows exactly what those fully settled directives will look like, or what Bitcoin's specific role will be.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin and the broader crypto market is a journey, not a destination. Stay informed, keep learning, and make sure to adapt your investment strategy as this exciting new field continues to develop.\n\nFor now, Bitcoin and its crypto kin are still high-risk, high-reward investment assets. They may play a part in a diversified portfolio, but only for investors who can stomach their roller-coaster-like ups and downs. I'm cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin's future as a long-term winner. Just tread lightly in the cryptocurrency field, keep an eye out for bear traps, and manage most of your nest egg in more traditional forms such as stocks, cash, or index funds."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies, also known as digital currencies, have been all the rage over the last couple of years. Coins like bitcoin have skyrocketed in recent years, and financial institutions are starting to get on board. Two of the largest and most popular coins are ethereum and bitcoin. This article explores and compares both currencies and will help you understand the pros and cons of each so you can determine which one might be right for you.\n\nRead: Looking To Diversify In A Bear Market? Consider These 6 Alternative Investments\n\nAbout Cryptocurrencies\n\nA cryptocurrency is a secure, virtual currency that is nearly impossible to counterfeit. These digital coins are assets that exist on distributed networks. The networks\u2019 decentralized nature means that governments and other central authorities can\u2019t control them.\n\nBlockchain technology, which is a technology based on a distributed ledger database, underpins cryptocurrencies. Cryptography and encryption techniques secure the network and prevent tampering. Every transaction is stored as a separate block on the chain, and those records are guaranteed to be accurate and immutable.\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin\n\nEthereum and bitcoin are arguably the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market today. They certainly are the largest by market cap. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is over $363 billion, while ethereum\u2019s market cap is around $161 billion.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, launched in 2009 by a crypto architect known pseudonymously as Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea for this digital currency was simple yet revolutionary. It promised an alternative to traditional currency, called fiat currency, via a decentralized and transparent financial system accessible to all.\n\nBitcoin works on a blockchain network. Transactions happen between bitcoin wallets using private keys, which provide mathematical proof of their authenticity. Cryptography ensures both the integrity and the chronological order of transactions, and a distributed consensus system confirms pending transactions.\n\nBitcoin has capped the number of coins that can be minted at 21 million. Once that number has been reached, the coins can still be traded but no more can be introduced.\n\nThe following stats from CoinMarketCap are current as of Sept. 27:\n\nBitcoin Quick Stats Price $18,973.12 Market cap $363.56 billion Market dominance 39.17%\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum\u2019s white paper was released in 2013, and the project officially launched in 2015. Ethereum is an open-source, community-driven project and has seen quite a bit of evolution since its inception.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that snubs censorship and surveillance. The focus of the project is to enable access to financial services and commerce for everyone. It does this by allowing for the development of other cryptos as well as the execution of smart contracts on its platform, CoinMarketCap explained.\n\nIBM describes smart contracts as programs stored on a blockchain that run automatically when predetermined conditions are met. These functionalities make Ethereum a more versatile platform than Bitcoin.\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum allows for an unlimited number of tokens.\n\nGood To Know The main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is the fact that Ethereum is programmable. That feature broadens the scope of Ethereum, making it more than just a digital currency. It makes Ethereum a marketplace for financial services, games and apps.\n\nEthereum Quick Stats Price $1,316.21 Market cap $161.30 billion Market dominance 17.39%\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum: Pros and Cons\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are both blockchains, but they serve different purposes, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has a narrow purpose: provide an alternative to fiat currency and a system for processing transactions.\n\nPros\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nThe coin has the best brand recognition and most liquidity, which has made it the most widely accepted cryptocurrency.\n\nThere\u2019s still huge potential growth for bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin uses blockchain technology designed to protect against fraud or identity theft.\n\nIts value is based on supply and demand, not political interference.\n\nBitcoin has a faster transaction speed than fiat currency.\n\nThe 21 million cap on bitcoins could drive prices higher by making the coin more scarce.\n\nCons\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price is highly volatile.\n\nBitcoin has limited functionality.\n\nBitcoin uses an extreme amount of energy, which is bad for climate change.\n\nBitcoin doesn\u2019t provide 100% anonymity.\n\nPros and Cons of Ethereum\n\nWhereas the purpose of the Bitcoin blockchain is to process transactions and store value, Ethereum is a platform that also supports the development of other projects.\n\nPros\n\nEthereum leverages blockchain technology for its decentralized, transparent system.\n\nThe technology enables functionality beyond digital currency, such as decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\nThe developer community is one of the largest.\n\nThe Ethereum platform processes transactions faster than Bitcoin.\n\nEthereum recently completed an upgrade that reduced its carbon footprint 99.95%.\n\nCons\n\nThe coin is not bitcoin, which is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world.\n\nbitcoin, which is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world. The transaction fees are potentially higher than on the Bitcoin platform.\n\nEthereum is slow compared to alternative platforms, referred to as \u201cEthereum killers,\u201d like Solana, although the recent upgrade could improve Ethereum\u2019s speed exponentially.\n\nUnlimited supply could dampen demand for ethereum tokens.\n\nKnow the Risks of Investing In Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nAll cryptocurrency investments are speculative. The more aware you are of the risks, the better you can mitigate them if you decide to invest.\n\nHype and FOMO Risks\n\nThe fear of missing out is a powerful driver for people to buy cryptocurrencies. With bitcoin\u2019s explosion in value over the past few years, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the hype. No one wants to lose out on the chance of getting rich from cryptocurrency, especially when it has already made many people extremely rich.\n\nHowever, regulators continue to warn the public that you could lose all your money in crypto. For example, bitcoin\u2019s price has dropped about 60% since the beginning of the year, and ethereum is down significantly, too.\n\nSecurity Risks\n\nBecause cryptocurrencies are digital assets, they\u2019re potentially vulnerable to hackers. The first month of 2022 saw several notable hacks. Hackers stole $80 million worth of crypto from Quibit, a decentralized platform. And the Crypto.com exchange reported the theft of about $35 million in cryptocurrency, most of which was ethereum and bitcoin.\n\nAnalysts also warn that quantum computers could hack crypto wallets, even though the technology isn\u2019t mainstream yet.\n\nTax Risks\n\nThe IRS wants to know about gains from crypto investments you\u2019ve sold. There\u2019s a tax question on Form 1040 specifically regarding cryptocurrencies. Failing to disclose this information could lead to stiff penalties or possible criminal investigation.\n\nRegulatory Risks\n\nGovernment-imposed regulations could make cryptocurrency safer and more secure, but they might also affect your access, the ways you use it and how it\u2019s taxed.\n\nWhich Investment Is Right for You?\n\nBoth bitcoin and ethereum have increased in value by staggering percentages since their release. But they\u2019re still experimental, and with innovation comes problems that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warns haven\u2019t been resolved. For example, the decentralized nature of blockchains means there\u2019s no one to turn to if things go wrong. In addition, transactions can be much more expensive on a blockchain than through a bank or debit or credit card.\n\nIf you decide that investing in a blockchain is the way to go, it makes sense to consider the top two. Determining which one\u2019s right for you depends on your needs and goals.\n\nBitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency and has the most support commercially. If you\u2019re looking for a cryptocurrency alternative to fiat currency, bitcoin seems to be a good choice, as long as you\u2019re prepared to weather the volatility.\n\nTechnically speaking, Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency. The Ethereum network acts as a marketplace for users to buy and sell goods and decentralized applications. If you\u2019re interested in more than a cryptocurrency, ethereum might be a good choice for you.\n\nDaria Uhlig contributed to the reporting for this article.\n\nData is accurate as of Sept. 27 2022, and subject to change.\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Which Crypto Is Better?\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining is big business these days. Major operations run racks of rigs and even their own power plants to solve blocks \u2014 but you can spin the wheel and hope for a BTC payoff for less than the cost of a midrange smartphone or gaming console.\n\nIt just takes ordering a few parts, which together come in just under $400.\n\nThat includes the single-board computer \u201cRaspberry Pi Zero W 2,\u201d a heatsink case and a USB-based bitcoin miner built on Antminer\u2019s BM1397 ASIC chip promising up to 350 gigahashes per second (GH/s).\n\nThat\u2019s the same chip used in Bitmain\u2019s famous Antminer S17 and S17 Pro.\n\nRaspberry Pi Zero 2 W: $22\n\nBitcoin USB stick miner: $325\n\nHeatsink case: $19\n\nAttaching a heatsink helps absorb and disperse the heat generated by the components ensuring the entire thing doesn\u2019t pop. It would be especially helpful if actually planning to mine bitcoin from your pocket.\n\nMining bitcoin with tiny devices is known as \u201clotto mining,\u201d on account of how little chance one has of successfully mining Bitcoin blocks with micro setups at home.\n\nAt 350 GH/s hash rate, solo miners would need to run for an average of up to 21,400 years to strike it big. Bitcoin block rewards are expected to run out by around 2140, due to the network\u2019s \u201chalving\u201d events every four years, which slash issuance.\n\nFor scale, Marathon Digital \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest publicly-listed bitcoin miners \u2014 generated 2,195 BTC ($60 million) in the year\u2019s first quarter, averaging around 24 BTC ($656,300) per day.\n\nFirms like Marathon run tens of thousands of ASICs at once, which dramatically increases their chances of solving blocks. Solo miners \u2014 like those running singular Raspberry Pis \u2014 can boost their odds by joining mining pools.\n\nWhenever the pool wins, so do all those contributing hashpower. Major mining pools Foundry, AntPool and F2Pool currently mine more than 70% of all Bitcoin blocks, with participants sharing their hashpower for a cut of the pool\u2019s block rewards.\n\nSolo mining can actually work \u2013 but it\u2019s rare\n\nHere\u2019s some inspiration for those feeling lucky: Two solo Bitcoin miners separately mined their own Bitcoin blocks within two days of each other last year, using only a small number of mining chips.\n\nThe miners used solo mining software Solo CK Pool, which unlike standard pools, serves as something of a web proxy for bitcoin miners. Successful miners recoup 98% of all rewards, with 2% going to the administrator for hardware upkeep, code iterations and the like.\n\nThe chances of actually winning a Bitcoin block reward from a single rig is about one in 1.1 billion, according to one estimate. Hence the comparison to a lotto draw. SoloCK miners have snagged six blocks over the past six months and 257 over the past eight years.\n\nFraming participation in Bitcoin consensus \u2014 in support of a potently censorship-resistant money network \u2014 as mere lottery may be a little gauche.\n\nStill, tiny miners like these serve as a perfect entry point for tinkering with blockchain technology in its purest form. You might as well be rewarded with an (almost) never-ending lottery ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Now, they can skip this step with a new system that lets them open an account for free and begin working with the company\u2019s payments technology right away.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure that our offer covers all possible projects and caters to developers of any size, from individuals and small teams, to large businesses and enterprises,\u201d the announcement adds. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve come up with a tiered offering with diverse transaction and volume allowances and project count limits, each with its own pricing.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a completely free option, the company noted, as part of its \u201cvision of expanding global monetary freedom.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to PYMNTS\u2019 Karen Webster last year, Zebedee Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer Andre Neves said bitcoin is the perfect currency to provide standardization when it comes to transferring value.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t have to be something as complicated as a video game or metaverse. \u201cWe\u2019re in a virtual world and we can talk and chat and stream 8K video quality, but we\u2019re unable to transact value in this conversation,\u201d Neves said.\n\nOn a worldwide scale, one of the key reasons for this is that each jurisdiction has its own currency and its own laws, Neves told Webster.\n\n\u201cSo standardizing a money for the world and for the virtual world, is really important \u2014 you really need that medium of exchange with the ability to move value without needing to have some foray into foreign exchange.\u201d\n\nAs a digitally native currency bitcoin \u201cprovides that capability regardless of any geographical or real-world constraint,\u201d Neves said.\n\n\u201cSo regardless of where in the world you find yourself and where I find myself, we\u2019re able to transact with the same sort of monetary standard. Powering virtual worlds and real worlds with the same money is a very powerful thing. And I think we\u2019re just scratching the surface of what it means.\u201d"

        "title": "The promise of crypto has not lived up to its initial excitement - The Economist",
        "content": "\u201cT wo years ago everyone wanted to be us. Now everyone hates us,\u201d laments a 24-year-old crypto founder at a gathering in New York. After once seeming as if it might threaten to remake the entire financial system, crypto has gone through a spectacular decline. The market value of all cryptocurrencies ballooned from $250bn at the start of 2020 to $3trn by late 2021. But it has since fallen back to just $1.3trn. Even more important, public trust in crypto has hit rock bottom after a string of high-profile swindles and crashes, notably the downfall of FTX , a popular cryptocurrency exchange, in November 2022.\n\nListen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the <audio> element.\n\nYet in Dubai, crypto talk remains boisterous. The emirate has opened its doors to the industry by creating a regulatory body dedicated to crypto that has created \u201cmuch needed clarity\u201d, argues Alex Chehade, the local boss of Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Binance and other exchanges such as Crypto.com and Bybit set up shop in Dubai in 2022. Big questions still hang over the industry. At one meeting in Dubai this correspondent met an indignant response when he asked if crypto would ever find its \u201ckiller app\u201d. \u201cWe already have it,\u201d snapped a developer.\n\nAttitudes to crypto have polarised. To some, its promise of revolutionising finance has been shattered. It was meant to sidestep a stodgy rent-seeking financial system that was expensive, inaccessible to many and possibly untrustworthy. Yet the financial system is not static: it is actively adopting new technology. And regulators are belatedly acting. Singapore, once a leading crypto hub, asked Binance to pause operations as of December 2022. It had issued just ten licences out of some 600 recent applications to set up crypto businesses. As many as 25 out of 45 countries looked at by the Atlantic Council, a think-tank, have imposed partial or complete bans on crypto.\n\nPockets of hope remain. The price of bitcoin is up almost 70% this year, including a surge after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. There is some evidence to suggest that cryptocurrencies win more adherents in weak countries that are afflicted by high inflation or currency depreciation, such as Argentina and Nigeria. That points to a deeper truth, which is that the strongest arguments for using crypto have always been where the alternatives are worse.\n\nIn 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto said in his bitcoin pitch that \u201cWhat is needed is an electronic payment system\u2026allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.\u201d Crypto transactions promised more efficiency and the avoidance of irksome control by governments. Yet neither benefit has really come about. Transactions still have to be verified by computers that maintain a copy of the associated blockchain, one reason why Coinbase, a listed American crypto-exchange, charges a 1% fee for payments. Add the expense of moving money in and out of crypto and overall costs are quite high. Why pay fees to transact on the Ethereum blockchain when India\u2019s UPI or Brazil\u2019s Pix is cheaper? It is not easy to avoid government oversight, either. To move from traditional currency into crypto, consumers must use on-ramps, which tend to be centralised platforms like Coinbase or Binance. The same holds for stablecoins that are pegged to the dollar. They must be trusted\u2014exactly what crypto claimed not to need. Decentralised platforms like Uniswap exist, but they are hard to use and bring other risks, such as losing the private key, a password that can never be recovered. Mining bitcoin also brings huge environmental costs.\n\nA sudden love of regulation\n\nCrypto advocates now claim to want regulation to reduce uncertainty and regain consumer trust. But regulators often go a lot further than many had expected. The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s governor, Shaktikanta Das, has said crypto has \u201cno inherent value\u201d and he may ban most of it. On January 5th American regulators (including the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) declared that crypto-assets on decentralised networks were \u201chighly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.\u201d The government also seized Signature Bank, which was a prominent bank for the crypto industry, after it collapsed.\n\nAs regulation comes for crypto, it will make transactions more expensive. Mr Poon of Hong Kong Polytechnic University says much of the cost of financial transactions comes from complying with regulations like know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering laws. Yet friendlier regulation could help the industry. Binance and other crypto firms are in Dubai precisely because of the regulatory cover it provides. The question then is: if crypto faces the same regulation as fintech firms, does it offer anything uniquely valuable?\n\nThere are places where crypto may still be useful. Kim Grauer, head of research at Chainalysis, which researches data from blockchains, finds hotspots of crypto adoption \u201cin places that suffer from currency depreciation\u2026or severe inflation.\u201d Crypto can act as a hedge. \u201cBitcoin in Lebanese currency is up something like 6,000%,\u201d notes Mr Chehade of Binance. Governments can also raise demand. Ms Grauer says Nigerian capital controls and Argentinian restrictions on holding dollars offer reasons for people to move funds into stablecoins and bitcoin. Their governments might detect a risk to financial stability. Their citizens see an alternative to incompetent or corrupt officials.\n\nAnother commonly cited case is cross-border payments, particularly for illiquid currency pairs. \u201cGlobalisation today has been capped at $10,000,\u201d says Navin Gupta, a banker who is now at Ripple, a crypto firm that does international payments. Cross-border fees take a greater share of value for smaller payments because of high fixed fees, which deter some transactions entirely. Ripple\u2019s network allows cryptocurrencies to intermediate trades between traditional currencies, reducing costs. The firm, worth $15bn at the start of 2022, has processed some $30bn through its cross-border service in five years.\n\nBy comparison Wise (formerly TransferWise), a cross-border fintech, processed $33bn in the first quarter of 2023 alone. It reduces costs by doing parallel domestic transfers in place of two cross-border ones. A study by the World Bank finds that cross-border remittance costs have fallen from 7% a decade ago to 5%. And if consumers are savvy enough to use the best option (often a new-age fintech)? Transfer costs may then fall to just 3%.\n\nIn 2015 Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum and crypto\u2019s philosopher king, wrote a blog post conceding that crypto had not yet found a \u201ckiller app\u201d. Mr Buterin\u2019s post went beyond the payments and finance parts of crypto. Yet his point still rings true. Crypto will not remake the global financial system because it has proved neither efficient nor immune to regulation. Instead, a stronger candidate for digital change may be central banks.\u25a0"

        "content": "Bitcoin crushed by US dollar urfinguss\n\nMore investors backed bitcoin than the dollar as the preferred investment during a default, a Bloomberg survey found.\n\nBut gold was the top choice, due to its history as a safe haven asset and recent price gains.\n\nTreasurys were the second choice, as most expect the US would still meet its debt obligations eventually.\n\nIn the case of a US default, retail investors favor bitcoin over the dollar, underlining the token's appeal as a safe haven asset.\n\nThat's according to Bloomberg's most recent Markets Live Pulse survey, which asked investors what they would buy if the US hit its debt ceiling.\n\nTo be sure, gold led the list of responses, with 51.7% of professional investors and 45.7% of retail investors preferring bullion.\n\nIn second place came Treasurys, drawing 14% of professionals and 15.1% of retail investors. Bitcoin followed with 7.8% and 11.3%, respectively \u2014 versus the dollar's 7.8% and 10.2%.\n\nA default could arrive as soon as June 1, if lawmakers fail to lift the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling before the government runs out of money.\n\nBloomberg's MLIV survey also found that 41% expect greenback would weaken in a default, which could also accelerate de-dollarization trends.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin rallied in an earlier period of stress this year, namely the banking crisis sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nPreviously, Standard Chartered told Insider that this is largely due to bitcoin's decentralized mechanism, and estimated that a default could push the cryptocurrency up by about $20,000.\n\nOther analysts told Insider that they expect gold would likely climb in a default as well. A weakening dollar could further propel the metal. Continued purchases of gold by central banks and a loosening of global monetary policy could also help support it.\n\nAs for Treasurys, UBS has previously predicted bonds would rally if the debt ceiling doesn't get resolved, as this would most likely lead to economic contraction and investors would still see US debt as a relatively safe haven.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

Bitcoin has retreated almost 12% from a 10-month high reached last month.\n\n\"Bitcoin is a bubble. It has no inherent value and is terribly overpriced,\" Hanke, a former economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in a tweet on Sunday. It's not the first time the economist has slammed the cryptocurrency - in March, he said it is a highly speculative asset, adding that \"buying bitcoin is a fool's game.\"\n\nA bubble exists when investors perceive the current price of an asset to be much more than what it should be, based on its long-term, underlying qualities. It's typically marked by a rapid escalation of an asset's price to such highs that it becomes unsustainable, causing it to collapse in value.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin has slumped to around $27,380 from a peak of more than $31,000 reached in mid-April. It rallied 88% through the first 3 1/2 months of the year amid optimism that an end was in sight to the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases.\n\nThe token's weak performance in recent weeks came as senior cryptocurrency execs warned about regulatory stasis in the US. The Securities and Exchange Commission and other watchdogs have cracked down on major crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken.\n\nThe collapse of crypto-friendly lenders Signature and Silvergate Capital amid the still-unresolved banking turmoil has also undermined investor sentiment in the digital-asset sector."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price broke below its 55-day resistance at $27,000 on May 12, down 12.3% in 30 days. But more importantly, it decoupled from the S&P 500 Index, which is basically flat from 30 days ago and 15% below its all-time high.\n\nBitcoin price in USD (right) vs. S&P 500 futures (left), 12-hour. Source: TradingView\n\nAs the chart indicates, for some reason, Bitcoin (BTC) investors believe that the favorable macroeconomic trends for risk markets were overshadowed by the increasing risk perception of the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nFinancial crisis could fuel Bitcoin\u2019s price increase\n\nFor starters, there\u2019s the impending United States government debt ceiling crisis, which, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, could cause an \u201ceconomic and financial catastrophe.\" The increased risk of default should, in theory, be beneficial for scarce assets, as investors seek shelter from a weaker U.S. dollar.\n\nThe $5.6 trillion commercial real estate market in the U.S. is subject to additional risks due to high interest rates and troubled regional banks. Guggenheim Partners chief investment officer Anne Walsh stated, \u201cWe\u2019re likely going into a real estate recession, but not across the entire real estate market.\"\n\nThere is also positive news on the cryptocurrency regulatory front, as the industry gathers additional support against the regulatory efforts of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed an amicus brief on May 9, defending the Coinbase exchange and accusing the SEC of deliberately creating a precarious and uncertain landscape.\n\nFurther fueling investors\u2019 hope is the Bitcoin halving expected for April\u2013May 2024, when the miners\u2019 incentive per block will be reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Addresses holding 1 BTC or more reached one million on May 13, according to the Glassnode analytics firm. In total, a whopping 190,000 \u201cwhole-coiners\u201d have been added since February 2022.\n\nDespite the recent Bitcoin price weakness, there are enough drivers and potential triggers to sustain a considerable bull run in the upcoming months. Professional traders are aware of the liquidation risks associated with futures contracts, so their preferred investment strategies include options instruments.\n\nHow to apply the risk reversal strategy in Bitcoin\n\nOptions trading presents opportunities for investors to profit from increased volatility or obtain protection from sharp price drops, and these complex investment strategies, involving more than one instrument, are known as \u201coption structures.\"\n\nTraders can use the \u201crisk reversal\u201d option strategy to hedge losses from unexpected price swings. The investor benefits from being long on the call option but pays for those by selling the put. Basically, this setup eliminates the risk of the stock trading sideways and comes with limited risk if the asset trades down.\n\nProfit and loss estimate. Source: Deribit Position Builder\n\nThe above trade focuses exclusively on June 30 options, but investors will find similar patterns using different maturities. Bitcoin was trading at $27,438 when the pricing took place.\n\nFirst, the trader needs to buy protection from a downside move by buying 2.3 BTC puts (sell) $22,000 options contracts. Then, the trader will sell 2.0 BTC put (sell) $25,000 options contracts to net the returns above this level. Finally, the trader should buy 3.2 call (buy) $34,000 options contracts for positive price exposure.\n\nInvestors are protected down to $25,000\n\nThat options structure results in neither a gain nor a loss between $25,000 (down 9%) and $34,000 (up 24%). Thus, the investor is betting that Bitcoin\u2019s price on June 30 at 8:00 am UTC will be above that range while gaining access to unlimited profits and a maximum 0.275 BTC negative return.\n\nIf the Bitcoin price rallies toward $37,250 (up 36%), this investment results in a 0.275 BTC gain. Moreover, after a 42% rally to $39,000 within 45 days, net returns are 0.41 BTC. In essence, unlimited gains with a capped loss.\n\nEven though there is no initial cost associated with this options structure, the exchange will require a 0.275 BTC margin deposit to cover the negative exposure.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged down 0.039%. The S&P 500 futures fell 0.042%, while the Nasdaq Composite futures lost 0.078%. The three U.S. indexes fell in regular trading on Friday as concerns remain about liquidity at regional banks and delays in talks to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said earlier in May that the Treasury will start to fail to meet U.S. payment obligations as early as June 1. Faster action is needed by Congress to avoid that scenario, she said.. But with an agreement yet to be reached, concern that the crisis could lead to a debt default is affecting general investor sentiment.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s Group of Seven finance ministers meeting in Japan, Yellen said that a U.S. default would spark an \u201ceconomic and financial catastrophe\u201d that will trigger a \u201cglobal economic downturn.\u201d\n\nYellen plans to update Congress on just how close the country is to defaulting on its financial obligations in the next two weeks, Bloomberg reported Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden and congressional leaders are scheduled to gather this week to discuss the forthcoming \u201cX date,\u201d or when the government may go into default.\n\nOn June 14, the Federal Reserve will decide its next move on interest rates. The rate of between 5 and 5.25% is the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 84.5% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June. However, it also predicts a 15.5% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, up from 3.9% on Friday."

        "title": "4 alarming charts for Bitcoin bulls as $27K becomes formidable hurdle - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied nearly 60% to around $27,000 in 2023 amid anticipations that the Federal Reserve would pause its quantitative tightening amid the U.S. banking crisis. Still, BTC price has failed to move beyond $30,000 decisively.\n\nBuying exhaustion at this key psychological level led to a price correction toward $25,000 over the past week. Interestingly, the decline has strengthened Bitcoin's correlation with several traditional financial metrics.\n\nBut does this raise the risk of Bitcoin continuing its downtrend in Q2? Let's have a closer look.\n\nU.S. dollar index's double bottom\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback\u2019s strength against a basket of top foreign currencies, rose 1.4% to 102.70 in the week ending May 14. The rise marked the dollar\u2019s best week since September 2022.\n\nInterestingly, the dollar\u2019s rise left behind a potential double-bottom pattern, confirmed by two low points near a similar horizontal price level of around 100.75. A double-bottom pattern is a bullish reversal setup, suggesting DXY could rise toward 105.85 in the next few months.\n\nDXY weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nDXY's weekly relative strength index (RSI), which has undergone a rebound after reaching 35 \u2014 just five points above the oversold threshold \u2014 further hints at bullish continuation, which is typically a bad omen for Bitcoin's price.\n\nThe main reason is the strengthening negative weekly correlation between Bitcoin and DXY, with the coefficient around -50 as of May 14.\n\nEarlier in the week, the latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed headline inflation dropped to 4.9% in April versus the previous month\u2019s 5%. However, core inflation was up 5.5%, suggesting underlying price pressures remain sticky, which for now has cooled down Fed rate cut expectations.\n\nJohn Authers from Bloomberg writes:\n\n\u201cThe odds of a \u2018pause\u2019 in interest rate hikes next month have now risen to virtual certainty in futures and swaps markets, having been seen as an 84% chance before the numbers came out.\u201d\n\nA Fed pause should result in a stabilizing bond market. History indicates that stable interest rates have been good for U.S. Treasurys but bad for stocks, with Erin Browne and Emmanuel Sharef of Pimco saying:\n\n\u201cIf the Fed pauses at its peak rate for at least six months and the U.S. slides into recession, then history suggests 12-month returns following the final rate hike could be flat for 10-year U.S. Treasurys, while the S&P 500 could sell off sharply.\u201d\n\nThus, a souring risk appetite would be a boon for the dollar, while increasing the risk of Bitcoin failing to reclaim $30,000 in the short term.\n\nGold price near key reversal point\n\nThe price of gold has risen nearly 15% to over $2,000 an ounce amid the banking crisis. The positive correlation with Bitcoin has also grown stronger with its weekly coefficient reading at 0.82 as of May 14.\n\nBut gold\u2019s rally has brought its price to an infamous horizontal resistance level near $2,075. In March 2022, this level was instrumental in triggering a sharp bearish reversal phase that led gold to drop by up to 22%.\n\nXAU/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSimilarly, testing the level as resistance in August 2020 preceded an 18% price decline. Should the scenario repeat in 2023, gold\u2019s price could fall toward its 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) near $1,850.\n\nGold\u2019s weekly RSI, treading around its overbought reading of 70, indicates a similar downside scenario. As a result of the precious metal\u2019s positive correlation with Bitcoin, the latter may see a similar correction in Q2.\n\nM2 money supply declines\n\nM2 measures cash in circulation plus dollars in bank and money-market accounts. The M2 figure surged by more than 40% during the Covid-19 pandemic due to the Fed's quantitative easing, hitting a peak of $21.84 trillion in January 2022.\n\nIt has since declined to $20.81 trillion, down over 4% from peak, in May 2023.\n\nU.S. M2 monthly supply chart. Source: TradingView\n\nA 2%-plus drop in the M2 supply \u2014 something which has happened four times to date \u2014 is bad news for the stock market since it preceded three depressions and one panic.\n\nIn other words, the significant move lower in M2 could foreshadow new lows for Bitcoin, which often moves in tandem with U.S. stock indexes.\n\nCurrently, the weekly correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq-100 index is 0.92.\n\nBitcoin price \u201crising wedge\u201d\n\nBitcoin appears to be heading toward the $15,000-$20,000 price range, depending on its potential breakdown point from what appears to be a rising wedge pattern.\n\nBTC/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nFor technical analysts, a rising wedge is a bearish reversal pattern that appears when the price rises higher inside a range defined by two contracting, ascending trendlines. It resolves after price breaks below the lower trendline, falling by as much as the maximum wedge height.\n\nRelated: BTC price bounces at $25.8K lows amid warning over low whale interest\n\nIf this BTC price pattern is confirmed, particularly given the above-mentioned macro indicators, Bitcoin price stands to decline to as low as $15,000 in 2023, down about 45% from current price levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Are ZK-proofs the answer to Bitcoin\u2019s Ordinal and BRC-20 problem? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Bitcoin network has recently faced a litmus test due to the increased demands of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens being inscribed onto the blockchain.\n\nThe resulting increase in fees and transaction congestion has frustrated the wider Bitcoin (BTC) community, considering some BRC-20 tokens involve memecoins that have attracted billions of dollars of capital in recent weeks.\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem has benefitted from the development of scaling solutions, which have brought massive improvements in network capacity and processing ability. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs), in particular, have grabbed headlines over the past few months, with several projects adopting the scaling technology.\n\nCointelegraph spoke exclusively to Eli Ben-Sasson, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused StarkWare and the pioneer of zero-knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge (zk-STARKS), to explore whether the technology could be the answer to Bitcoin\u2019s latest challenge.\n\nZK-proofs are cryptographic protocols that allow a party to prove a statement or data is true without revealing any information. The technology assures privacy and security while adding capacity to blockchains by reducing the computational load needed to verify transactions and other data stored on-chain.\n\nRelated: zk-STARKs vs. zk-SNARKs explained\n\nThe renowned mathematician and cryptographer credits Bitcoin for starting his journey of exploration around the promise of validity, cryptographic and zero-knowledge proofs to improve blockchain technology. Highlighting the \u201cdeeply entwined\u201d nature of the scaling solutions and blockchains, Ben-Sasson summed up the potential for ZK-proofs to benefit the Bitcoin network:\n\n\u201cValidity proofs and STARKs allow you in a very efficient way to use the integrity of math to extend the orbit of integrity that a blockchain covers to invite anyone to participate and add more capacity to the network.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s blockchain will continue to act as an inner circle of integrity, while ZK-proofs extend the origin of integrity and bring in more capacity, creating what Ben-Sasson described as a \u201cpositive flywheel\u201d effect:\n\n\u201cThe more capacity you bring, the more social functions can be used; even if it\u2019s money, you can do micropayments, or you can add new things if you allow smart contracts. And then there\u2019s more trust in the system, and it adds more value.\u201d\n\nBen-Sasson reiterated his belief that the Bitcoin network could see greater integrity and efficiency from the mathematical benefits of validity proofs. He added that Bitcoin developers Greg Maxwell, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn had been early proponents of zk-STARK transparent proofs of validity and privacy, which do not require trusted setup and remain quantum secure.\n\nRelated: Ordinals and BRC-20 will disappear in a matter of months, says JAN3 CEO\n\nThe potential for Bitcoin \u2014 which first and foremost acts as decentralized hard money \u2014 to allow more general forms of computation and social functions remains a discussion point in its community. For Ben-Sasson, the potential of incorporating ZK-proofs is being driven by the market demand for extra functionality on top of Bitcoin by BRC-20 tokens:\n\n\u201cFor it [BRC-20] to really have the level of integrity that is offered by Bitcoin, there must be a hard fork that allows these things to be verified and validated and have the integrity of Bitcoin. And that\u2019s a huge decision and a huge debate point.\u201d\n\nAs reported by Cointelegraph, the ZeroSync Association is a newly formed startup developing ZK-proof powered tools that allow users to validate the state of the Bitcoin network without downloading the blockchain or trusting a third party for verification.\n\nZeroSync\u2019s validity proof allows users to instantly verify Bitcoin\u2019s chain state, removing the need to download over 500 gigabytes of blockchain data currently required to sync a Bitcoin node.\n\nZeroSync co-founder Robin Linus told Cointelegraph that its chain state proof does not solve network congestion directly but would remove the need for users to download inscriptions that have been clogging up the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHowever, ZK-proofs still hold promise in helping remedy current network congestion. Linus said ZeroSync has also developed a Bitcoin client-side validation protocol dubbed zkCoins, which allows the processing of up to 100 token transactions per second:\n\n\u201cIt uses inscriptions, but the on-chain footprint is much lower than BRC-20, and it does not bloat the UTXO set.\u201d\n\nLinus added that a zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) verifier on Bitcoin\u2019s main layer could enable an entire spectrum of scaling solutions, including ZK-rollups, trustless bridges to sidechains, and the potential to peg BTC onto zkCoins to enhance privacy and increase throughput:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see that validity proofs are gaining more traction in the Bitcoin community now. People have already started discussing a new opcode on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.\u201d\n\nLinus also noted that other Bitcoin layer-2 scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network, Fedimint and Cashu \u2014 privacy-preserving custodians based on Chaumian eCash \u2014 have seen increased interest following network congestion driven by Ordinals and BRC-20 minting.\n\nMagazine: ZK-rollups are \u2018the endgame\u2019 for scaling blockchains: Polygon Miden founder"

The survey was conducted from May 8\u201312, involving a total of 637 respondents, including professional and retail investors.\n\nMore than 50% of finance professionals will buy gold if the U.S. government fails to avoid a debt default.

Photo: PA/Alamy (MauriceNorbert)\n\nA new technology upgrade has allowed memecoins, such as Pepe Coin (PEPECOIN-USD), to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain for the first time, causing congestion issues and driving BTC transaction fees to a two-year high.\n\nThe upgrade enabled the creation of Ordinals, which are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain, while the BRC-20 standard facilitates the trading of memecoins.\n\nSome 14,300 BRC-20 tokens have been launched, amassing a total market capitalisation exceeding $1bn (\u00a3800m). Ordi (ORDI-USD), a memecoin honoring the Ordinals protocol, is currently the most valuable, worth $400m.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Taproot upgrade, which happened in November 2021 has since caused an increase in activity on the network, which processes transactions every 10 minutes, and significantly slowed transaction settlement.\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nThe development has been met with criticism from some bitcoin pioneers, such as Max Keiser and Samson Mow.\n\n\u201cOrdinals are like barnacles on the hull of a ship, the market will scrape them away,\u201d broadcaster and bitcoin advocate Keiser told Yahoo Finance UK.\n\n\u201cThey are like digital plastic-pollution floating in the ocean, humans are great at polluting the environment, both analog and digital.\"\n\nSince the beginning of May, bitcoin (BTC-USD) transaction fees have skyrocketed, now averaging over $20.\n\nOrdinal inscriptions have soared, with users adding images, videos, and other content, totalling over 5 million inscriptions, according to Dune Analytics data.\n\nAccording to Samson Mow, founder of JAN3, the hype surrounding Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens is unsustainable and will dissipate within months.\n\n\u201cThese guys are basically paying massive amounts of fees that go directly to Bitcoin miners, and there is no way this can be sustained,\u201c Mow said in an interview with Cointelegraph.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin rebounds above $27,000 after a week of decline\n\n\u201cThey will fade away after even months, let\u2019s not talk about years here.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThese are just short-term money grabs similar to most things on competing chains like Ethereum (ETH-USD) and Solana (SOL-USD).\u201d\n\nTwitter account 'Bitcoin is Saving' posted: \"Marginalised peoples in developing countries will have to pay more to run their Bitcoin nodes and send transactions because privileged wealthy whites want to put JPEG drawings on the blockchain as status symbols.\"\n\nMarginalized peoples in developing countries will have to pay more to run their Bitcoin nodes and send transactions because privileged wealthy whites want to put JPEG drawings on the blockchain as status symbols.

The technical breakdown of BTC and ETH adds to the market\u2019s worries,\u201d Mikkel Morch, chairman at the cryptocurrency hedge fund ARK36, said on Friday.\n\n\u201cDespite the challenges, there are potential catalysts for a recovery. The U.S. debt ceiling and regional banking concerns could drive interest in cryptocurrencies like BTC,\u201d Morch added.\n\nConcerns over the Bitcoin network\u2019s congestion persist, as there are currently 225,869 transactions waiting to be validated in the mempool. Meanwhile, the network surpassed 6.8 million Ordinals inscriptions, according to data from Dune Analytics, increasing block space demand on the world\u2019s first blockchain network.\n\nEther, world\u2019s second-biggest cryptocurrency, gained 1.27% to US$1,829, but lost 1.18% on the week.\n\nLitecoin was the biggest gainer of the day, rising 7.65% in 24 hours to US$87.26, bringing its weekly gains to 7.21%.

Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 strengthened 0.81% to close Monday at its highest since November 2021, driven by hopes for positive Japanese earnings reports and export-fueled buying on the back of a weak yen.\n\nInvestors are now looking forward to a raft of economic releases from China including industrial production, retail sales, and fixed asset investment data for April, after the world\u2019s second largest economy showed signs of slowing following an initial recovery from pandemic-led disruptions.\n\nThe Philippine central bank may leave its key interest rate unchanged at its policy meeting this week, Governor Felipe Medalla reportedly said, after the Southeast Asian nation raised interest rates by 425 basis points since May 2022, in one of the most aggressive tightening cycles.\n\nU.S. stock futures strengthened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The S&P 500 futures index rose 0.33%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.26% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures increased 0.31%.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders on Tuesday, to continue negotiations on raising the debt limit, to keep the government solvent.

        "content": "Crypto Twitter was briefly set ablaze on May 14 with a suggestion that the world\u2019s first real-world purchase made by Bitcoin may have been for a JPG, not pizza.\n\nIn a tweet from independent developer Udi Wertheimer, the Bitcoin advocate shared a screenshot showing what could have been the first-ever purchase using Bitcoin \u2014 even predating the infamous Bitcoin Pizza.\n\nThis Twitter Space was FIRE\n\n\n\nWe discovered that:\n\n\n\nthe first purchase EVER with bitcoin was buying a JPEG for 500 BTC in Feb 2010\n\n\n\nit pre-dates the the famous 10,000 BTC pizza\n\n\n\nsatoshi himself helped facilitate the JPEG sale\n\n\n\nlaser-eye cult in absolute SHAMBLES pic.twitter.com/b6ESOkbf0i \u2014 Udi Wertheimer \u200d\u2642\ufe0f (@udiWertheimer) May 14, 2023\n\nThe posted screenshot is dated Jan. 24, 2010, a full four months before Bitcoin Pizza Day \u2014 when Bitcoin developer \u200b\u200bLaszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 Bitcoin for two pizzas in what is widely considered to be the first real-world purchase made using Bitcoin.\n\nThe screenshot shows a user called Sabunir attempting to sell a picture for 500 Bitcoin \u2014 worth roughly $1 at the time \u2014 on theBitcoin forum Bitcointalk.\n\nIt even highlighted that pseudonymous Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto was trying to get involved in helping the sale go through.\n\nDoubt has been cast on the claim however, with a tweet from professional poker player turned crypto investor Mike McDonald pointing to a screenshot that suggests the Bitcoin transaction could have been a donation, meaning the JPG was never actually \"sold.\"\n\nI'm not sure if it has been dispelled yet but it seems like Sabunir's 500 btc was a donation rather than sale.\n\n\n\nHe posted his address for his NFT Jan 24, then posted it again in the btc logo thread on Feb 24.

        "content": "The heavily shorted U.S. dollar surged against the basket of fiat currencies last week, putting pressure on risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC). The leading cryptocurrency, however, held on to key support in a positive sign for the market.\n\nThe dollar index, which gauges the greenback's performance against fiat currencies, rose by over 1.3%, registering the biggest single-week percentage gain since February, data from charting platform TradingView show.\n\nBitcoin fell by 5.8%, living up to its reputation of being negatively correlated to the greenback. However, sellers failed to establish a foothold under the 200-week simple moving average, a widely-tracked technical line that capped the upside in February.\n\n\"By defending this key average, the bulls have convinced the market of the sustainability of the long-term bullish trend,\" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at the FX Pro, said in an email.\n\nPer Kuptsikevich, the cryptocurrency must top $28,500 to bring in cautious buyers waiting on the sidelines for stronger evidence of an end of the price pullback. At press time, bitcoin changed hands near $27,400, up 1.4% on the day, having hit a high above $31,000 last month.\n\nSome observers expect the dollar to continue moving higher, keeping gains in cryptocurrencies under check.\n\n\" I think the dollar is due for a bounce as markets take back some FED easing implied in the futures curve. My fundamental FX framework: currencies are driven by real growth differentials and political considerations over longer cycles, but in the short term, it\u2019s all about playing relative central bank policy (changes in nominal rates). Depending on how violent the dollar upswing gets, it could cause some short-term damage to assets like commodities and crypto,\" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets, derivatives engine at Marex, said in an email.\n\nAnalysts at Swissblock Insights voiced a similar opinion in a note to subscribers on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The DXY could hit anywhere from 104 to 107 considering it crossed over the 102 level since mid-March,\" analysts said, adding that renewed dollar strength could continue to pressure BTC as its ties to TradFi are strengthening.\n\nSwissblock Insights expects dollar index to resume downtrend after a brief bounce.\n\nPer Swissblock Technologies, the impending dollar bounce will likely pave the way for a deeper decline that would bode well for cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"This month-long structure will eventually break, and both assets will experience price discovery \u2013 bitcoin to the upside, and DXY to the downside,\" Swissblock Insights said.\n\nSolot expects a pullback in bitcoin to be short-lived, offering a \"a great entry point to position\" for investors.\n\nWallets known to hold coins for at least six months have accumulated coins during the recent bout of weakness, hinting at confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term prospects."

A relatively calm week of macro triggers means less chance of volatility from external sources.\n\nAdd to that the upcoming difficulty adjustment taking it to yet another all-time high, and the case could be made for upside continuation.\n\nCointelegraph looks at some major BTC price factors affecting the week ahead.\n\nBitcoin price weekly close offers mixed signals\n\nAfter clinching a weekly close at around $26,930, Bitcoin is already headed higher, reaching $27,550 overnight, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.\n\nWhile encouraging, the close nonetheless marked Bitcoin\u2019s weakest since mid-March \u2014 something popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital is keenly aware of.\n\nIn part of Twitter analysis on the day, he warned that $27,600 was now the level to flip to support.\n\n\u201cFirst, BTC failed to reclaim the $28800 level on the Weekly (orange).

The weakness in Bitcoin pulled several altcoins lower, indicating weakening sentiment.\n\nA silver lining is Bitcoin\u2019s solid bounce on May 12. Several analysts anticipate Bitcoin to start a recovery but monitoring resource Material Indicators sounded cautious.\n\nIn a recent analysis, they said that the lack of a strong bid from the whales at lower levels could be a concerning sign. They believe that the bullish perspective will invalidate if Bitcoin sustains below the 200-week moving average.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nOver the next few days, the progress on the debt ceiling talks between leaders from Congress and the White House is expected to take center stage. The uncertainty and risks of a potential U.S. default could keep the rally in the equities markets under check but it is difficult to predict how Bitcoin and altcoins will react to all the chaos.\n\nBitcoin has started a corrective phase and most altcoins have broken below their respective support levels. Only a handful of cryptocurrencies are looking positive on the charts. Let\u2019s analyze the chart of the top five cryptocurrencies that may turn up in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nThe long tail on Bitcoin\u2019s May 12 candlestick shows that the bulls are aggressively buying the dips to the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBuyers will try to push the price back into the triangle but may face stiff resistance from the bears. The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($27,959) and the relative strength index below 41 indicate that bears have a slight edge.\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will again attempt to sink the BTC/USDT pair below $25,250. If they can pull it off, the selling may intensify and the pair could crash to $20,000.\n\nOn the upside, the bulls will have to clear the hurdle at the resistance line to regain control. The pair may then retest the overhead resistance at $31,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAfter facing stiff resistance at the 20-EMA, the bulls have cleared the obstacle. This indicates that the bulls are trying to seize control. The pair may first climb to the 50-simple moving average and then to $28,400.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down sharply from the current level, it will suggest that the bears are trying to flip the support line of the triangle into resistance. The pair may then plunge to the crucial support at $25,250.\n\nCardano price analysis\n\nCardano\u2019s (ADA) solid rebound off the uptrend line on May 11 suggests that lower levels continue to attract strong buying.\n\nADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will try to resume the recovery by propelling the price to the 20-day EMA ($0.38). This level may act as a minor barrier but if bulls overcome it, the ADA/USDT pair could soar toward the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. This level is likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.\n\nAnother possibility is that the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and drops to the uptrend line. The repeated retest of a support level at short intervals tends to weaken it. That may open the doors for a potential fall to $0.30.\n\nADA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls pushed the price above the moving averages, indicating that the bears may be losing their grip. The 20-EMA has started to turn up gradually and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating that the bulls are on a comeback.\n\nIf buyers pierce the overhead resistance at $0.37, the pair could pick up momentum and rally to $0.40 and later to $0.42. Conversely, if the price turns down from $0.37, the pair may slide to the uptrend line.\n\nCosmos price analysis\n\nCosmos (ATOM) snapped back from the $10.20 support on May 10, indicating that the bulls are buying the dips to this level.\n\nATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to halt the relief rally at the 50-day SMA ($11.28) but the bulls have not given up much ground. This enhances the prospects of a rally above the 50-day SMA. If that happens, the ATOM/USDT pair could rally to the downtrend line.\n\nThis is an important level for the sellers to guard because a break above it will invalidate the bearish descending triangle pattern.\n\nThe critical support to watch on the downside is $10.20. If it cracks, the descending triangle will complete and the pair may then plummet to $8.50.\n\nATOM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the relief rally is facing selling at higher levels, but the price action is forming a possible inverse head-and-shoulders pattern that will complete on a break and close above $11.30. The pair may then start an up-move to $12 and subsequently to $12.50.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will suggest that the bears are in control. The pair may then slump toward the vital support at $10.20. A bounce off this level could keep the pair inside the boundaries of $11.30 and $10.20 for a while longer.\n\nRelated: 4 alarming charts for Bitcoin bulls as $27K becomes formidable hurdle\n\nLido DAO price analysis\n\nLido Dao (LDO) rebounded off the $1.60 support and has reached the overhead resistance at the 20-day EMA ($1.95).\n\nLDO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to protect the 20-day EMA but the bulls have not given up. This suggests that the buyers expect the recovery to continue. If bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the LDO/USDT pair could rally to the downtrend line. This level is likely to attract strong selling by the bears.\n\nIf buyers arrest the next decline above the 20-day EMA, that would suggest a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. The pair could then start a sustained recovery above the downtrend line.\n\nOn the downside, the bears will have to sink and sustain the price below $1.60 to indicate the resumption of the downtrend.\n\nLDO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls are trying to propel the price above the overhead resistance at $1.98. If they succeed, the pair will complete a bullish double-bottom pattern. This reversal setup has a target objective of $2.39. If this level is also crossed, the pair may reach $2.60.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down from the current level or $1.98 and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that bears are active at higher levels. That may keep the pair stuck between $1.57 and $1.98 for some time.\n\nArbitrum price analysis\n\nArbitrum (ARB) has been finding support near the psychologically important level of $1, indicating that the bulls are aggressively buying the dips.\n\nARB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nOn the upside, the bears have been attempting to stall the recovery at $1.20 but a minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have kept up the buying pressure. That increases the likelihood of a break above $1.20. If that happens, the ARB/USDT pair could rise to $1.40 and later to $1.50.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down sharply from $1.20. That will point to a possible consolidation between $1 and $1.20 for a few days.\n\nARB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA on the four-hour chart has started to turn up, and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. Buyers will try to strengthen their position by pushing the pair above $1.20. If they do that, the pair will complete a double-bottom pattern, which has a target objective of $1.35.\n\nThe first sign of strength for the bears will be a break and close below the 20-EMA. That could pull the pair to $1.05. A slide below $1 will signal the resumption of the downtrend.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Zhong's heist of 50000 Bitcoin gives way to new 'industrial' era in crypto crime - DLNews",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence and quantum computing are poised to accelerate cryptocurrency crime\n\nSurging number of hacks poses existential challenge to DeFi\n\n\n\nJudging by the numbers, James Zhong seems like a master crypto criminal. The 50,000 Bitcoin he stole 11 years ago from Silk Road, the dark web contraband emporium, was worth $3.4 billion by 2021. After pleading guilty in 2022, he received a 366-day prison sentence last month.\n\nYet Zhong\u2019s case is actually rather quaint when you consider his masterstroke: The 32-year-old Florida man filched Bitcoin from Silk Road by simply double-clicking on a withdrawal button. He was not so much ingenious as simply ingenuous.\n\nBad Actors\n\nThese days, Zhong would be utterly outmatched by a new generation of bad actors with far more nefarious objectives in mind, said Eric Jardine, a cybercrimes expert at Chainalysis.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a movement from your idiosyncratic individuals to larger-scale, more industrial-type operations, many of which are really traced back to state sponsorship or state cover,\u201d Jardine told DL News.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nNOW READ: Europe\u2019s rules for crypto wallets nears final showdown\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group, which US officials say is involved in financing the rogue state\u2019s nuclear missile programme, is one of those operations. Russia harbours other crypto crime rings, experts say.\n\nThese groups, along with organised crime networks, routinely plunder crypto protocols for wealth, and use them to launder proceeds from ransomware attacks that target hospitals, schools, and other public bodies.\n\nMeanwhile, lone wolves with greater expertise than Zhong prey on blockchain bridges and other vulnerable projects. The Euler bridge hack was a recent case. Even code-audited ventures such as Merlin aren\u2019t secure. The exchange lost $1.82 million after developers exploited a backdoor in the code despite having the integrity of its code evaluated by experts.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u2018There\u2019s been a movement from your idiosyncratic individuals to larger-scale, more industrial-type operations.\u2019 \u2014 Eric Jardine\n\nAs a result, the decentralised finance community is confronting questions that are becoming existential: How can crypto projects defend themselves against these foes? If billions of dollars\u2019 worth of tokens are routinely stolen, how can people trust DeFi? And law enforcement crackdowns and headlines are poised to further tarnish the DeFi brand.\n\nLucrative target\n\nBecause more attacks are coming, Jardine said, especially on blockchain bridges. They are supposed to expand the scope of the DeFi ecosystem by connecting networks together. So securing them is vital.\n\n\u201dYou have a really lucrative target, and you\u2019re probably going to be seeing a lot of targeting in the future, just on the basis that there\u2019s a lot to steal,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance that they\u201d \u2013 the bridges \u2013 \u201care more vulnerable than other sectors of the crypto economy, like centralised exchanges.\u201d\n\nStill, there is hope. Last September, Chainalysis helped recoup $30 million worth of tokens stolen from Axie Infinity, the blockchain gaming giant.\n\nMore than $600 million had been plundered from the Ronin Network, a sidechain built for Axie Infinity. Chainalysis traced stolen funds to offramps and liaised with law enforcement and industry authorities to quickly freeze funds.\n\nNOW READ: Fund managers still lured to crypto \u2018because of the returns\u2019\n\nIn the old days, Jardine said, hackers had more anonymity. Now the blockchain provides a permanent record of activities, making it much easier to trace assets. The former mode of crypto theft \u2013 hack some wallets, steal some funds and live large because you think no-one\u2019s ever going to catch you \u2013 is bound to be less productive these days, he said.\n\nAnd ideally, the funds wouldn\u2019t be taken in the first place. The latest defence is \u2014 what else? \u2014 AI. Protocols can deploy artificial intelligence programs that analyse source code cheaply and comprehensively far quicker than a human could. While this approach has only begun to be tested, it could provide a way forward for embattled cybersecurity devs.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities\n\n\u201cYou run a smart contract through something like ChatGPT and try to see what it flags as potential security vulnerabilities,\u201d Jardine said. \u201cYou start to peel off the things that are vulnerable and keep the core, or revise the core so that it prevents exploitation and emulation.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s quantum computing. Researchers have long sought to harness subatomic particles to exponentially increase computing speeds, and as they move closer to workable solutions fears have mounted the new technology will tear conventional encryption to shreds.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just a matter of time before all this gets a lot worse.\u2019 \u2014 Meera Sarma\n\nMeera Sarma, the CEO and founder of the cybersecurity firm Cystel, says industry leaders may be underestimating how rapidly quantum hacking will hit DeFi projects. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time before all this gets a lot worse,\u201d she told DL News.\n\nThere are companies trying to work out how to defend against quantum hacking, she says. It\u2019s already possible to buy a two-qubit quantum computer, perhaps for as little as $5000. A two-qubit (quantum bit) computer is the equivalent of running four computers at once, Sarma said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how well it will work,\u201d she warned. \u201cEight- to 12-qubit is when it starts to pose a real threat.\u201d\n\nNOW READ: A wallet likely linked to Do Kwon moves $7m while crypto king in jail\n\nJardine acknowledges that quantum hacking is \u201ca massive break in terms of speed of computation, and you have to accommodate that.\u201d But he argued that a lot depends on who has the technology first, and that it will probably be \u201cthe good guys\u201d rather than a James Zhong type of character who grabs a quantum computer off the shelf.\n\nAs for the hackers themselves, Sarma said, they have similar motivations to Zhong \u2014 not just greed, but a desire to impress peers. The difference is that professional hackers want to keep their heads down.\n\nLavish spending\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from what Zhong did.\n\nHe was a hapless nerd who morphed into an outlaw and spent lavishly on real estate and gold bars and rocked up at yachts and Miami nightclubs with glamorous women on either arm, according to the case made by federal prosecutors.\n\nHe didn\u2019t even bother to launder his loot. When police raided his home in 2021, they found a hard drive that contained thousands of Bitcoin stashed in a Cheetos Popcorn tin. And he showed off his high life in loads of social media images.\n\n\u201cHe put his head above the parapet, which is quite unusual,\u201d Sarma said. \u201cNormally what happens is that attackers are very, very subtle about the money they make. They often invest it in properties, often convert it into white money, if you will.\u201d\n\nWith the Zhong case now closed, a far more serious phase un crypto crime has begun.\n\nDo you have a tip about crypto crime or another story?

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies To Watch: Week of May 15 - Investopedia",
        "content": "Keep an Eye on These Coins\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has had a middling week in terms of prices, with most tokens' values remaining flat. The market is gearing up for some big regulatory changes, especially in the U.S. A handful of tokens dominated the market in the latest week.\n\nWe examine Kava (KAVA), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Lido DAO (LDO), Rocket Pool (RPL), and Litecoin (LTC). In selecting these assets, we have considered several factors, including positive technical developments, significant news events, and noticeable changes in price.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Kava (KAVA) jumped 48%, possibly because of the impending Kava 13 mainnet upgrade.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin SV (BSV) has risen by more than 17%, perhaps because users are switching to BSV from Bitcoin of congested trading for the latter as a result of Ordinals.\n\nLido DAO (LDO)'s price increased more than 13% as Lido DAO has posted a spike in transaction volume.\n\nRocket Pool (RPL) is up by about 11%, possibly because of the advance in ETH staking after the Shapella upgrade.\n\nLitecoin (LTC) is up by more than 10% ahead of the upcoming LTC halving.\n\n\n\nKava (KAVA)\n\nThe Kava (KAVA) project's token was one of the week\u2019s biggest gainers, with the 48% increase likely tied to the upcoming Kava 13 mainnet upgrade. The upgrade, postponed to Wednesday, will bring several improvements to the Kava network, including better performance for stakeholders and an improved capacity to send assets between Cosmos and Ethereum networks.\n\nKava is a decentralized finance, or DeFi, lending platform that describes itself as combining \"the speed and interoperability of Cosmos with the developer power of Ethereum.\u201d KAVA is trading at around $1.01, having been priced at 69 cents last week (see chart below).\n\nKAVA Price: TradingView\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV)\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV), a spinoff of Bitcoin, experienced a price increase of more than 17% in the week. There haven't been any specific developments to account for this, but one might be linked to Bitcoin Ordinals.\n\nThe Bitcoin network has become congested due to the popularity of Ordinals, a protocol that enables digital assets to be inscribed onto a satoshi. Some users may be switching to the spinoff, Bitcoin SV, as a consequence of this congestion and also because this network offers low transaction fees. BSV is changing hands at about $35.88, having traded at $30.50 last week (see chart below).\n\nBSV Price: TradingView\n\nLido DAO (LDO)\n\nLido DAO (LDO) is a project focused on ETH staking. The token's price gained by 13% after the project experienced a large increase in transaction volume.\n\nLido recorded a notable increase in activity in the first week of May, regularly receiving greater than $50 million in daily transactions during that time. LDO is priced at about $2.10, having been valued at $1.72 last week (see chart below).\n\nLDO Price: TradingView\n\nRocket Pool (RPL)\n\nRocket Pool, another project working on ETH staking, also posted a price increase. The RPL token was up by more than 11% following Ethereum\u2019s recent so-called Shapella upgrade.\n\nThis network upgrade allows ETH stakers to unstake their ETH, which is a major move that originally drew many individuals to staking. RPL is trading at around $52.75, having started last week at $47.60 (see chart below).\n\nRPL Price: TradingView\n\nLitecoin (LTC)\n\nLitecoin (LTC) had a price increase of more than 10%, with the Aug. 4 LTC halving being the most likely reason for the rise.\n\nHalving is a mechanism built in to certain blockchain protocols, including Litecoin's, and it halves block rewards. The Litecoin mechanism splits rewards every four years. This lowers the rate at which Litecoins are generated. Current Litecoin block reward is 12.5 LTC; after the halving, the block reward will be 6.25 LTC. As such, halved cryptocurrencies will become \u201crarer\u201d and this usually leads to an increase in price, as has been the case with Bitcoin halvings.\n\nLTC is now priced at $87.43, having been around $82.10 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nLTC Price: TradingView\n\nAs of the date this article was written, the author does not own any of the assets discussed here.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "Bitcoin had a bearish performance last week after being unable to push past $30k.\n\nBTC whales contributed to the ongoing sell pressure.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] attempted to push above $30,000 not so long ago. However, it has since shown significant weakness after multiple retests of the same level, and last week\u2019s bearish performance is a testament to it.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nThe failure to stay above $30,000 was an important observation because it underpinned an ascending resistance line. The latter is part of Bitcoin\u2019s ascending price pattern since the start of the year.\n\nWe previously contemplated the probability of Bitcoin descending as low as the $24,000 price range where it would retest its YTD support line. Fast forward to the present and the probability of that support retest is now higher.\n\nBitcoin has so far delivered a bearish performance by as much as 13% in the first half of May. It exchanged hands at $26,929 at the time of writing.\n\nIf Bitcoin maintains this pace for the next two weeks, the chances of a retest of the ascending support line will be quite high. The $25,000 price level is of particular interest because it has already demonstrated resistance in multiple instances. In other words, the same price level represents a significant support range.\n\nAssessing the prevailing Bitcoin demand\n\nWhales have the most significant impact on price, hence, a look at their activity offers some insights into what to expect. On-chain data revealed that addresses holding a balance equal to or greater than 1000 BTC shrunk in the last three days.\n\nThe above observation suggested that whales were contributing to sell pressure at press time. This further validated bearish expectations. Bitcoin\u2019s on-chain volume also pulled back substantially in the last five days. As such, more BTC holders were at a loss in the last four weeks.\n\nIt is now clear that the market is experiencing less confidence, hence the liquidity outflows. If the market maintained the same trend, then more sell pressure, especially from the retail segment if whales continue to sell.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nUnpredictability is one of the main characteristics of the market. Current expectations are leaning predominantly in favor of the bears. However, a bullish surprise might still emerge, but it would have to be backed by healthy whale accumulation.\n\nBut, that remains to be seen, hence the press time market conditions continued to indicate that the bulls were sidelined."

Analysts are sharing their thoughts on the potential value of Bitcoin within a decade\u2019s time and why they think people need to start investing now to make millions. Bitcoin is considered the largest crypto by market cap and was the first popularised version of cryptocurrency. Even with most currencies on the decline, Bitcoin started the year with a price of $17,000 (\u00a313,596.60) and is currently trading at around $27,000 (\u00a321,594.60). In light of this, crypto traders are breaking down why they believe investors should put their money into the cryptocurrency now to reap the benefits later.

Much like a traditional ATM, a Bitcoin ATM allows you to cash out Bitcoin directly to your bank account or sometimes even to the same bank account linked with the ATM.\n\nFees and Security Considerations When Using a Bitcoin ATM\n\nBear in mind that Bitcoin ATMs come with transaction fees, which are typically higher than those associated with regular ATMs.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin ATMs\n\nPros Cons Easy to use and beginner-friendly. High transaction fees. Immediate transaction. Lower security than online wallets. Anonymity if no KYC is required. Limited availability. Fiat to crypto conversion. Often have buy/sell limits.\n\n2. Bitcoin Debit Cards\n\nA Bitcoin debit card links directly to your crypto wallet, allowing you to spend your Bitcoin at traditional points of sale. When you\u2019re ready to sell Bitcoin, simply swipe your crypto debit card or scan the QR code, and the equivalent dollar value is deducted from your Bitcoin balance.\n\nFees and Security Considerations When Using a Bitcoin Debit Card\n\nUsing a crypto debit card incurs various fees, including transaction fees, withdrawal fees, and even an exchange rate when converting Bitcoin to fiat currency.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin Debit Cards\n\nPros Cons Allows spending Bitcoin like fiat money. Conversion fees may apply. Wide acceptance where regular cards are used. Dependent on card issuer policies. May come with cashback or reward programs. Not fully anonymous. Simplifies crypto to fiat conversion. Could be considered a taxable event.\n\n3. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Exchange\n\nPeer-to-peer exchanges enable you to sell Bitcoin directly to other users. This form of peer to peer selling can be beneficial, especially when you\u2019re trying to sell crypto at a specific price.\n\nFees and Security Considerations When Exchanging on a P2P Marketplace\n\nAs with all transactions, selling Bitcoin on a peer-to-peer exchange incurs a fee. Always ensure the platform you choose has robust security measures.\n\nPros and Cons of Peer-to-Peer Exchanges\n\nPros Cons Allows direct trading between parties. Can be susceptible to scams. More privacy and anonymity. Transactions can take time to complete. Can support many payment methods. Less regulatory oversight. Might bypass some governmental restrictions. Lack of advanced trading tools.\n\n4. Cryptocurrency Exchange like Bitcoin.com.au\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges like Bitcoin.com.au are platforms where you can sell Bitcoin and transfer the proceeds directly to your bank account. These crypto exchanges make cashing out Bitcoin a breeze.\n\nFees and Security Considerations When Selling on a Cryptocurrency Exchange\n\nWhen you sell Bitcoin through a centralised Bitcoin exchange, you\u2019ll incur transaction fees. It\u2019s also crucial to consider the tax implications of selling Bitcoin.\n\nPros and Cons of Cryptocurrency Exchange\n\nPros Cons Wide selection of cryptocurrencies. Vulnerable to hacking. Advanced trading tools and features. May require KYC/AML procedures. Typically high liquidity. May be subject to governmental oversight and regulations. User-friendly for various skill levels. Fees can vary and may be high.\n\n5. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading\n\nOver-the-Counter (OTC) trading involves a broker exchange, where you can sell Bitcoin directly to a third party broker. This method is typically used for large Bitcoin transactions and can help mitigate the impact of large sales on the Bitcoin price.\n\nFees and Security Considerations When Selling Bitcoin Through Over-the-Counter Trading\n\nWhile OTC trading might avoid price slippage, it still incurs fees. These trades are typically handled by third-party broker exchanges and must comply with anti-money laundering laws.\n\nPros and Cons of OTC Trading\n\nPros Cons Suitable for large transactions. Not suitable for small investors. Doesn\u2019t influence market prices. Requires trust between parties. Provides more privacy. Can lack transparency. Might offer better rates for large volumes. Less regulated than exchanges.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency, designed to allow financial transactions without the need for a centralised authority. It\u2019s a form of digital currency that can replace traditional currencies, allowing users to trade directly with each other, \u201cpeer to peer.\u201d\n\nWhat Must I Consider Before Cashing Out my Bitcoin?\n\nExchange Fees:\n\nConsider the transactional costs and the fees of transferring the funds to your bank account. These can eat into your profits, especially for smaller transactions.\n\nTax Implications:\n\nSelling Bitcoin might lead to capital gains tax, depending on your jurisdiction. Always seek advice from a tax professional for clarity on this aspect.\n\nMarket Conditions:\n\nThe value of Bitcoin is volatile, so it can be prudent to wait for favourable market conditions before selling your Bitcoin.\n\nSpeed:\n\nThe time it takes to cash out Bitcoin varies based on the method you choose. If you need to access funds quickly, you\u2019ll need to choose a faster cash-out method.\n\nThere you have it! Five ways to cash out your Bitcoin, along with essential considerations to keep in mind. Always remember, investing in Bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency, should be done carefully, considering your financial situation and risk appetite. Happy crypto trading!"

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ethereum face challenges, Liechtenstein embraces BTC, and Tether reports huge profit\n\nData from CryptoCompare shows that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) started the week on a downward trend, moving from around $28,000 to a low of roughly $26,500, before it started to recover. BTC is now changing hands at $27,400.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Ether, the second-largest digital currency by market capitalization, moved in a similar way with a downward movement from $1,850 to less than $1,750, before a recovery started to take it to the $1,830 mark.\n\nHeadlines in the cryptocurrency space this week varied, with some of the most significant surrounding congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain and glitches on the Ethereum network. Bitcoin\u2019s congestion, partly driven by the growing popularity of its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) Ordinals, saw leading exchange Binance briefly halt BTC withdrawals before adjusting withdrawal fees.\n\nWe've temporarily closed #BTC withdrawals due to the large volume of pending transactions.\n\n\n\nOur team is currently working on a fix and will reopen $BTC withdrawals as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nRest assured, funds are SAFU. May 8, 2023\n\nThe exchange revealed at the time it will keep on monitoring on-chain activity and \u201cadjust accordingly if needed.\u201d It also added it\u2019s working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which would alleviate such situations in the future.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s congestion comes at a time when liquidity has seemingly started dropping. According to CCData\u2019s Order Book data, Bitcoin\u2019s capacity to accommodate sizable orders without substantial price fluctuations has diminished since 2023.\n\nPer the data, the amount of BTC needed to change the price by 1% dropped from 1,400 ($23 million) in January to 462 ($13 million) in April.\n\nWhile Bitcoin suffered from congestion, an unexpected disruption occurred on Ethereum that saw the network become temporarily unable to fully authenticate transactions. The hiccup only lasted 25 minutes and while blocks were being proposed, they were not being finalized.\n\nParticipants using the blockchain noticed that their transactions were seemingly processing as usual, but during the 25-minute stretch of irregularity, these transactions were susceptible to being altered because of the malfunction.\n\nLiechtenstein to accept Bitcoin for state services\n\nLiechtenstein\u2019s Prime Minister and Finance Minister Daniel Risc has revealed that the country will soon allow Bitcoin payments for state services, which will be instantly converted to Swiss francs, its official currency.\n\nHe also expressed interest in investing some of the state\u2019s reserves, which amount to 2.23 billion francs (about $2.51 billion), in cryptoassets in the future. The country, which has no debt, saves three times its annual budget of 900 million francs (around $1 billion) and invests it in securities.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) National Security Division is said to be investigating cryptocurrency exchange Binance for allegedly allowing Russians to use its platform in violation of US sanctions.\n\nThe company and its executives have not been accused of anything related to the investigation, which is part of a national security probe and a criminal division investigation. Binance restricted its services in Russia after sanctions were imposed on the country in April 2022.\n\nHowever, according to a company executive, the exchange continued operations, blocking only certain areas of Ukraine no longer under government control and servicing non-sanctioned individuals.\n\nThe investigation comes at a time in which Binance has seen its spot trading volume suffer a 48% fall last month, marking the second consecutive month of declines for the cryptocurrency trading platform.\n\nAccording to CCData\u2019s latest Exchange Review report, Binance\u2019s trading volume dropped to $287 billion last month, recording its second-lowest monthly trading volume since 2021\n\nOver the week two of the world\u2019s top market-making firms, Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto, have also chosen to scale down their cryptocurrency trading operations in the United States as regulators crack down on the industry.\n\nJane Street has been in the crypto market since 2017 while Jump Crypto, the crypto division of Jump Trading, is shrinking its US presence while growing its operations abroad. Both firms still operate as market makers on a smaller scale, and haven\u2019t completely stopped their crypto activities.\n\nNotably, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a formidable force in American corporate advocacy, has taken up arms for digital asset industry players who have been vocally critical of U.S. regulatory approaches.\n\nThe Chamber has thrown its considerable weight behind the legal challenge brought against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Coinbase, which came as Coinbase asks the SEC to clarify its rules for the industry.\n\nTether reports $1.5 billion profit\n\nLeading stablecoin issuer Tether has recently disclosed a Q1 net profit of $1.5 billion, a figure that more than doubles its 2022 performance from the same period. As of May 9, the company\u2019s consolidated total assets were approximately $81.8 billion, while its consolidated liabilities amounted to $79.4 billion.\n\nIn a groundbreaking step, Tether, the entity responsible for USDT, has expanded its reserves report to include new categories. This marks the first instance of the company openly declaring its investment in bitcoin, physical gold, overnight repo, and corporate bonds.\n\nThe disclosed holdings include $1.5 billion in bitcoin and a substantial $3.3 billion in precious metals, which are likely being used to back Tether\u2019s gold-backed cryptocurrency, Tether Gold (XAUT).\n\nWhile Tether is reporting significant profits, crypto exchange Bittrex filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the District of Delaware. The exchange estimated it had more than 100,000 creditors, between $500 million and $1 billion in assets, and between $500 million and $1 billion in liabilities.\n\nFrancisco Memoria is a content creator at CryptoCompare who\u2019s in love with technology and focuses on helping people see the value digital currencies have.

        "title": "Can BRICS build something with Bitcoin? - City A.M.",
        "content": "Can BRICS build something with Bitcoin?\n\nBRICS is a term you may have heard thrown around in the news or in conversations about the global economy. But what exactly is BRICS?\n\nIn short, BRICS is an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. These five countries, representing some of the world\u2019s largest economies, came together in 2009 (and South Africa in 2010), with Saudi Arabia looking to join.\n\nThe population of this group is estimated at 3.2 billion people.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of BRICS is their plans to back a new currency with commodities. China first proposed this idea, and since then, the group has been working towards making it a reality. The goal of the new currency is to reduce reliance on the US dollar.\n\nThe formation of this new currency aims to re-establish the connection between hard assets and currency. A currency backed by gold, oil and other commodities would re-forge a link between money and reality. As this relationship is absent in the dollar system today, reducing the weaponization of the dollar and the risk of economic instability is the main driver behind the initiative.\n\nTo back the new currency, BRICS countries have been working on increasing their gold reserves, which will serve as a potential backing for the currency. They have also been exploring the possibility of creating a BRICS development bank to fund infrastructure projects in member countries and reduce dependence on institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nBut how practical is backing a currency with physical commodities?\n\nWhile the idea of a new currency backed by gold or other physical commodities will solve the current issue of fiat currencies being backed by thin air, there are also valid concerns about the practicality of such a system in the digital age.\n\nAn alternative to a physical commodity-backed currency is a Bitcoin standard. One of the main issues with backing a currency with physical commodities is trust. There needs to be trust that the commodities are actually there and that they are of the stated quality and quantity. This can be difficult to ensure, particularly when dealing with multiple countries with different regulatory systems and levels of transparency.\n\nThere are concerns about the environmental impact of using physical commodities as a backing for a currency. These commodities are not digital and cannot be carbon neutral, which could pose a challenge for meeting the needs of the ESG initiative.\n\nAnother question is who will audit the commodities? This is a crucial issue that must be addressed to maintain the integrity of the new currency system.\n\nWill they send in an auditor to verify China\u2019s gold reserves and likewise, will China be sending in investigators to validate Russia\u2019s oil reserves? What we do know is this type of arrangement will require trust, and although these countries have a mutually beneficial relationship now, that may not last forever. They will need a commodity-backed currency that is not based on trust.\n\nWhile the idea of backing a new currency with physical commodities may have its appeal, it faces significant challenges that make it impractical in today\u2019s world. Compare this to a Bitcoin standard, that can offer a viable alternative that is transparent, secure, and decentralised.\n\nIs it possible these countries have already thought this far ahead? Will the USA witness an epic own goal? Will they rise to the challenge and launch a revolutionary digi-dollar backed by Bitcoin? Or will the BRICS nations step up and embrace Bitcoin into their financial systems? Or, in a stunning twist of fate, will Bitcoin itself emerge as the ultimate champion and reign supreme over them all? The suspense is palpable!"

        "title": "Crypto market\u2019s focus remains on Memecoins as Bitcoin stabilizes around $27,000 - Nairametrics",
        "content": "Article Summary\n\nBitcoin and major altcoins remain rangebound as the market focuses on meme-coins, leading to soaring transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain and causing Binance to halt withdrawals twice.\n\nMilady (LADYS), a meme-coin, surged by over 5,250% within 24 hours and has a total diluted market capitalization of over $140 million, despite having \u201cno intrinsic value or expectation of financial return.\u201d\n\nBitcoin spot volumes are down 24% over the past week, and open interest surged by 5.3%, reaching a new 1-month high with below-neutral funding rates indicating that pessimists were the key aggressor.\n\nBitcoin remains rangebound and has now traded in the $27,000 mark for three consecutive Tuesdays. Bitcoin\u2019s prolonged directionless pattern has impacted most major altcoins as well, whose pattern reflects that of BTC. As conditions remain stable, the market has re-rotated its focus to memecoins, which has often tended to be a negative market impulse, suggesting an over-eager risk appetite.\n\nThe Wednesday FOMC press conference last week delivered in line with expectations, as the Target Rate was hiked by 25bps. Jerome Powell also indicated that interest rates were at appropriately restrictive levels. Nonetheless, he also added that further interest rate decisions would be data-driven.\n\nNon-farm payrolls (NFP) surprised to the upside last week, leading the market to price in an 18% chance of a further hike in the next FOMC press conference. All eyes are now focused on Wednesday\u2019s CPI release, which is expected to be a potential volatility catalyst. If the CPI were to surprise to the upside, it could lead the market to reprice hiking expectations for the June 14 FOMC press conference.\n\nWhat You Should Know\n\nOver the past week, particularly over the weekend, Bitcoin on-chain fees surged, causing Binance to halt withdrawals twice. The withdrawal halt also coincides with an apparent arbitrage erupting on Binance US, with Binance US trading at a 3-5% premium above the rest of the market.\n\nThis premium may be caused by market makers leaving the exchange and potential fiat-rail problems disincentivizing traders to take advantage of the ongoing arbitrage opportunity.\n\nThroughout the past week, transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain have skyrocketed as the mempool has experienced proper congestion. The congestion originates from the rising popularity of BRC-20, a token standard built on Bitcoin, allowing participants to create and send tokens via the Ordinals protocol.\n\nOrdinals has gradually amassed popularity this year, initially as a means to produce NFT-like assets enabled by the Taproot soft fork in 2021 and Segwit in 2017. Up until now, Ordinals have had a negligible impact on the market, but as of today, the market capitalization of BRC-20 tokens now stands at over $500 million.\n\nOrdinals have clogged the Bitcoin network, leading fees to soar. Over the weekend, at least one Bitcoin block saw fees surpass the block subsidy, and on Sunday, transaction fees represented 32% of the miner revenues, a level not seen since December 2017.\n\nAmidst the soaring fees, Binance disabled BTC withdrawals for two 2-hour periods and reshuffled wallet balances, leading to growing fear in the market.\n\nThe rally in the market comes as investors now turn their focus on meme coins. Asides from Pepecoin, another memecoin has gone viral, getting a boost from no other than Elon Musk, the self-proclaimed Dogecoin chief.\n\nOn May 11, Milady (LADYS), the self-organized memecoin of the namesake anime avatar nonfungible tokens (NFT) collection, surged by over 5,250% within 24 hours to trade at a $0.0000001528.\n\nThe day prior, American business magnate Elon Musk tweeted a meme using the imagery of a Milady NFT, sending the average Ether sale price of the collection soaring. According to token developers, LADYS has \u201cno association\u201d with Milady creator Charlotte Fang or Milady Maker.\n\nThe token \u201cis simply paying homage to an NFT collection we all love and recognize. LADYS is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.\u201d\n\nHowever, investors have found LADYS to encompass more than just meme value. At the time of publication, the total diluted market capitalization of the token surged past $140 million with a 24-hour trading volume of $230 million.\n\nAccording to the token\u2019s website, the total supply of LADYS is 888 trillion. The website further explains, \u201c94% of the tokens were sent to the liquidity pool (LP). LP tokens were burnt, and the contract is renounced.\u201d\n\nThe open interest held by active market participants on CME fell to a 14-month low on May 2 at 22,132 BTC, with active market participants representing 35% of the total open interest on CME.\n\nThe active market participant contribution has increased since, currently representing 38% of the open interest. Still, the open interest and active market participation rate reign low as institutional activity remains slow in BTC.\n\nThe market as a whole has been heavily rangebound throughout the past month, with Large Caps still outperforming the other indices and BTC on the backdrop of Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade outperformance.\n\nBitcoin spot volumes are down 24% over the past week. This trend is historically consistent with a period of price consolidation following large price movements, as we had in March. Currently, many market participants are likely in a wait-and-see phase.\n\nOpen interest surged by 5.3% last week, climbing above 280k BTC, reaching a new 1-month high. As highlighted earlier, the growth in open interest was accompanied by below-neutral funding rates, indicating that pessimists were the key aggressor.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Bitcoin price has ranged for nearly 2 months. The price has been quite volatile within the range, but there has been no material price action. Smaller price movements have led to lower realized volatility.\n\nThe market expectations tend to be backward-looking, leading implied volatility to fall as well. In sum, the market currently is in a directionless slumber state waiting for the next spark to lead the way.\n\nFunding rates have also fallen amidst BTC\u2019s push below $28k, suggesting cautious positioning with BTC fluctuating at range lows. Amidst last week\u2019s surge in open interest, perp prices lagged behind the spot, indicating that the primary force behind the rally above $26,000, is a result of growth in leverage originating from shorts."
