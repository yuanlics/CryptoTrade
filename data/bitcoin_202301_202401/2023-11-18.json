        "title": "With spot bitcoin ETFs looming, clock ticks on futures products - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nTwo years ago the first US exchange traded fund linked to bitcoin became the fastest ETF to hit $1bn in assets. But the coming weeks are set to test whether it and rival bitcoin futures ETFs can survive.\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) now stands at $1.4bn, and it tracks the crypto token through futures. This type of product has been the only way for US investors to add bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios, as regulators have not approved numerous applications to launch ETFs tracking the crypto token itself.\n\nBut the Securities and Exchange Commission now faces a January 10 deadline to approve one or more pending applications for \u201cspot bitcoin\u201d ETFs, which are expected to provide a cheaper way for investors to gain bitcoin exposure.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much life for that product after spot bitcoin launches,\u201d said Will Peck, head of digital assets at WisdomTree, which has filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. Peck acknowledged that bitcoin futures ETFs could retain some short-term trading utility but \u201cif you\u2019re a financial adviser or long-term investor, I don\u2019t see why you\u2019d have it\u201d.\n\nThis summer brought a flurry of fresh applications for spot bitcoin ETFs in a rush prompted by BlackRock and a legal blow for the SEC after a federal appeals court ruled against the regulator in a bitcoin ETF-related lawsuit in August.\n\nUS regulators continue to hold doubts around whether spot bitcoin ETFs would be appropriate for investors, in part because of the heightened risk that the price of these often illiquid tokens is vulnerable to manipulation. Big trading platforms in this space are subject to a range of regulatory investigations and one of the biggest, FTX, imploded a year ago leading its chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried to be found guilty on multiple fraud and money laundering charges this month. However, industry insider still believe regulators will approve spot bitcoin ETFs in early 2024.\n\nIf that happens, some think the futures ETFs and spot ETFs can coexist.\n\n\u201cI think savvy investors who are risk-averse will gravitate to a product like BITO,\u201d said ProShares chief executive Michael Sapir, whose firm has not filed for a spot product. Oversight of the futures market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and fund administration services provided by a known financial juggernaut both offer support to the model he espouses.\n\n\u201cThere is risk in investing directly in the spot market [as opposed to BITOs] regulated futures contracts being held by JPMorgan,\u201d he said.\n\nPeck also pointed out that bitcoin itself is already obtainable by anyone with investable assets and the technical skill to set up a digital wallet. This should temper expectations for \u201csome giant organic demand right out of the gate\u201d for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cI view the [spot bitcoin] ETF as a workflow solution for primarily the wealth management channel,\u201d Peck said.\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management and Swiss crypto manager 21Shares, which are among the firms hoping to launch a spot bitcoin product, earlier this month launched a suite of five digital asset ETFs, including a bitcoin futures strategy, which also indicates that futures ETFs will still have a role. Those two firms\u2019 spot bitcoin ETF application is set for its final deadline on January 10 after repeated delays on a decision by the SEC.\n\nThe potential for a dozen of spot bitcoin ETFs raises the prospect of fierce struggles to differentiate an ETF\u2019s brand, distribution tactics or price. In addition to 10 asset managers filing to launch spot bitcoin ETFs from scratch, Grayscale wants to reinvent the $23.3bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as an ETF \u2014 the SEC\u2019s initial refusal to allow this manoeuvre triggered Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit \u2014 while Brazilian asset manager Hashdex is trying to convert its existing bitcoin futures ETF into a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock, Ark Investment Management, Fidelity and Invesco are among the issuers waiting to hear from the SEC on their prospective spot ETFs, which trade over exchanges like stocks and enjoy favourable tax treatment. Spot bitcoin ETFs would not incur charges that futures-based products must bear, such as the cost of rolling over contracts on a regular basis, so they are expected to be substantially less expensive than both BITO and GBTC, which charge fees of 0.95 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.\n\nBecause the pending products are so similar and may launch all at once, their fees are likely to be a key differentiator compared to a typical ETF launch, which could drive down costs to investors, said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. He noted that providers are likely to fight for investors with low fees because \u201cthis is such a huge opportunity\u201d."

        "content": "SEC Delays Spot Bitcoin Applications Again, BTC Retraces\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts eagerly awaiting the green light for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will need to be patient as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again deferred decisions on pending applications. The recent eight-day window for potential approvals has concluded without any new ETFs being launched, prompting the SEC to announce a review of the applications in the coming year.\n\nThe SEC has postponed approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF from Global X and Franklin Templeton, as well as an application from Hashdex earlier this week. These delays have become a recurring theme as the SEC remains cautious about approving Bitcoin ETFs due to concerns surrounding market manipulation.\n\nAnticipation for the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF has long been held by market observers who believe it could result in a substantial influx of capital from Wall Street into the cryptocurrency market. Analysts at CryptoQuant suggest that such approval could provide a $1 trillion boost to Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\nDespite the delays, analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence now estimate a 90% likelihood of a Bitcoin ETF receiving approval by January. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has expressed its preparedness to swiftly respond if a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved, anticipating enhanced market stability and liquidity, similar to what has been witnessed with other asset classes like gold ETFs.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Crypto you can mine from a home computer in 2024 - Brave New Coin Insights",
        "content": "Crypto you can mine from a home computer in 2024\n\nWhile mining bitcoin on an individual computer is no longer viable, there are other cryptocurrencies that you can still mine at home if you\u2019re prepared to put in the effort.\n\nUpdated 2nd December 2023. If the volatility of investing in cryptocurrencies is too much for you but you still want to benefit from the new economy, setting up a small cryptocurrency mining operation at home may be the right choice for you. Although the quoted returns are high, we warn against \u2018cloud mining\u2019, as every crypto cloud mining offer we\u2019ve seen is a scam.\n\nWhat Crypto To Mine?\n\nThe easiest cryptocurrency to mine is one that doesn\u2019t require you to build a massive crypto mining rig. Although it was initially possible to mine Bitcoin using laptops and desktops, the growing mining difficulty as well as the advent of Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASICs) hardware created specifically for Bitcoin mining has made it all but impossible to profitably mine Bitcoin at home using the processing power of a PC or laptop computer. However, crypto mining from home is still an option for other popular cryptocurrencies in 2023. In this article, we will introduce many popular options \u2014 with some how-to instructions to help get you started.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE)\n\nMarket Cap: 9.7B Average Daily Volume: 200M-350M+\n\nThough the digital currency started out based on a meme, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been popularized by Elon Musk and has grown to be an altcoin with a substantial user base. DOGE is designed to add new coins each year as opposed to Bitcoin\u2019s finite supply. This is an added incentive for anyone mining it.\n\nHow To Mine Dogecoin\n\nTo mine DOGE, first ensure you have a wallet to store your earnings. You can download the Dogecoin core wallet or look on the website for other suitable online wallets. When mining using your CPU, the software that works best is CPU miner. Mining in this manner is possible, albeit at a slow rate. To increase the mining speed, you can use graphic cards. AMD and Nvidia cards are your best bet (see below for details on building mining rigs). If you decide on GPU mining, then the software you should use is either the cgminer or cudaminer. Full instructions for mining Doge can be found here.\n\nWhile crypto mining as an individual is doable, it is advisable to sign up to a mining pool as you can take advantage of larger processing power and speeds and thus generate higher mining returns. An example of a mining pool that supports Dogecoin is MultiPool. Once mined, exchanges that trade Dogecoin include Binance and OKX. If you\u2019re not an experienced trader, check our article on the best crypto trading bots, as many come with copy trading tools that mean you\u2019ll be making the same trades as the experts do.\n\nCheck current Dogecoin Price\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC)\n\nMarket Cap: 2.5B Average Daily Volume: 70M-150M\n\nThe main goal of the Ethereum Classic project was to ensure the survival of the original Ethereum blockchain, to provide an alternative for people who strongly disagreed with the DAO bailout of Ethereum and the direction taken by the Ethereum Foundation. Mining standard Ethereum is no longer possible as the Ethereum blockchain moved to proof of stake in October 2022. This was good news for Ethereum Classic as the resources formally used for mining ETH can easily be applied to mining ETC.\n\nHow To Mine Ethereum Classic\n\nWhile ETC can be mined with ASIC machines, it can also still be mined on desktop machines. A full list of mining resources for Ethereum Classic can be found here. Once mined, exchanges that trade Ethereum Classic include HitBTC, Binance and Huobi Global.\n\nCheck current Ethereum Classic price\n\nMonero (XMR)\n\nMarket Cap: 3B Average Daily Volume: 40M-100M\n\nMonero (XMR) is a popular anonymous digital currency. Furthermore, this altcoin\u2019s network was designed specifically to resist the development of Monero specific ASIC\u2019s. Therefore, it is well-suited for mining with a home computer.\n\nHow To Mine Monero\n\nTo begin, you must first download a wallet to store your coins. It is recommended to use the official Monero GUI client. Following this, the next step is to download mining software that supports Monero such as MultiMiner. MultiMiner is among the easiest to use but there are also other mining options available online. Once mined, exchanges that trade Monero include Binance and Bitfinex.\n\nCheck current Monero Price\n\nZCash (ZEC)\n\nMarket Cap: 540M Average Daily Volume: 20M-40M\n\nLaunched in 2016, Zcash (ZEC) is a leading privacy-centric digital currency. For mining crypto at home, Zcash\u2019s most important feature is that it employs the Equihash algorithm which is designed to be ASIC resistant. As a result, the home miner with a GPU can participate.\n\nHow To Mine ZCash\n\nBefore you can start mining Zcash, you will need to download the software that will control your hardware. Download the Zcash blockchain and set up your wallet. This will involve some waiting as the blockchain will need to download in its entirety on your node, and sync as well. Additionally, you will need to download the drivers for your graphics cards. Full instructions for mining Zcash can be found here.\n\nOnce mined, exchanges that trade Zcash include Binance, Huobi Global, and Bitfinex.\n\nCheck current Zcash Price\n\nRavencoin (RVN)\n\nMarket Cap: 250M Average Daily Volume: 5M-8M\n\nRavencoin (RVN) is a blockchain network optimized to move assets from one holder to another, such as tokens. Ravencoin is a fork of the Bitcoin code. It cites its main improvements over Bitcoin as a one-minute block reward time, a change in the number of coins released, but not the weighted distribution schedule, and the inclusion of capabilities for asset development and messaging. Ravencoin is open source.\n\nHow To Mine Ravencoin\n\nThe Ravencoin KAWPOW algorithm is designed to be ASIC resistant and can be mined using a consumer grade GPU. More details on mining Ravencoin are available here. Once mined, exchanges that trade Ravencoin include Binance, Huobi Global, and OKX.\n\nCheck current Ravencoin Price\n\nBitcoin Gold (BTG)\n\nMarket Cap: 238M Average Daily Volume: 1M-3M\n\nBitcoin Gold (BTG) was launched in 2017 as a fork of the original Bitcoin blockchain. Although it initially had a progressive roadmap aimed at extending the scalability and the development potential of Bitcoin (BTC), the project has fallen silent in recent years and has not updated its website roadmap or its Twitter feed since 2021. Nonetheless, BTG still has a respectable market cap and daily trading volumes, so anyone mining BTG will be easily able to find buyers.\n\nHow To Mine Bitcoin Gold\n\nBitcoin Gold uses Equihash-BTG, also known as Equihash(144,5) or Zhash and its price movements typically correlate quite closely with those of the original Bitcoin. Check here for more info on mining Bitcoin Gold. Once mined, exchanges that trade Bitcoin Gold include Binance, Bitfinex\n\nHitBTC and Huobi Global.\n\nCheck current Bitcoin Gold Price\n\nHorizen (ZEN)\n\nMarket Cap: 112M Average Daily Volume: 4M-6M\n\nLaunched in 2017, Horizen and its native cryptocurrency ZEN is a proof-of-work, equihash-based cryptocurrency and is mineable with a GPU. The project aims to ensure data integrity and privacy freedom by enabling real-world use cases within a secure interoperable blockchain ecosystem. In terms of price, like most alt-coins, ZEN tends to follow the overall price trend of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its highest price was US$148 achieved in December 2021. It has a respectable market cap and liquid daily trading volume.\n\nHow To Mine Zen Coin\n\nMore information about mining ZEN can be found here. Once mined, exchanges that trade ZEN include Binance, HitBTC and Huobi Global.\n\nCheck current ZEN price\n\nBytecoin (BCN)\n\nMarket Cap: 6.8M Average Daily Volume: 5k-10k\n\nAnonymous cryptocurrency Bytecoin (BCN) is another altcoin that is easy to mine on your home computer. Solo mining has been designed to be an easy process for Bytecoin users.\n\nHow To Mine Bytecoin\n\nTo mine BCN you need to download the Bytecoin wallet and run the program on your computer. After the program is done syncing with Bytecoin\u2019s blockchain, create a wallet for yourself. Then simply input the begin mining command and set your wallet address as the recipient. Solo mining works on Bytecoin\u2019s network, but the process is slow and may not get you much revenue. To enhance earnings, you can join a mining pool that supports CPU mining. A good example is bytecoin-pool.org. You will also need to download compatible mining software such as xmrig.\n\nIt is also possible to mine Bytecoin using GPUs. To mine in this manner, you will need to download software that is compatible with GPU mining. While the set-up process here is more complex than with CPU mining, it does lead to a faster mining process. Once mined, exchanges that trade Bytecoin include HitBTC and Poloniex.\n\nCheck current Bytecoin price\n\nBeam (BEAM)\n\nMarket Cap: 9.7M Average Daily Volume: 100k-150k\n\nA MimbleWimble implementation, Beam (BEAM) is well-suited for home mining. It employs the Hashii algorithm that supports GPU mining.\n\nHow To Mine Beam\n\nTo get started, download the official Desktop Wallet, depending on the operating system on your computer, your antivirus may flag up the mining software as a harmful program. Exclude it from that designation or you will run into trouble in the mining process. Once the blockchain has downloaded and synced you are ready to start mining. You must first configure your settings. Turn on the \u201cRun Local Node\u201d feature and set the number of mining threads to a number greater than zero.\n\nIt is important to note that Beam\u2019s infrastructure involves the use of expiring addresses to maximize privacy. However, you will require a permanent address to successfully recover your mining revenues or your tokens will be lost. To create a permanent address, navigate to the receive tab on the main dashboard of the software. You can create a new address and set it to never expire to use it for the mining set-up. Once mined, exchanges that trade Beam include Binance and Bitforex.\n\nCheck current Beam price\n\nVertcoin (VTC)\n\nMarket Cap: 6.6M Average Daily Volume: 30k-40k+\n\nLaunched in 2014, Vertcoin (VTC) is another popular choice among small miners. The digital currency is designed to stay true to the spirit of decentralization and financial sovereignty envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto when he created Bitcoin. The project\u2019s developers created the blockchain as a response to the growing influence ASICs were having on the Bitcoin blockchain and the mining ecosystem in general.\n\nHow to Mine Vertcoin\n\nThe algorithm employed with Vertcoin\u2019s POW consensus mechanism is Lyra2RE and is designed to be ASIC-resistant while simultaneously supporting GPU and CPU mining. VTC is popular because it has a very simple mining process. It is a matter of one click as the project developers have created the architecture to support easy mining. To start mining, download the software here, and join a mining pool to maximize mining revenues. Once mined, exchanges that trade Vertcoin include Bittrex and UPBit.\n\nCheck current Vertcoin price\n\nGrin (GRIN)\n\nMarket Cap: 3.5M Average Daily Volume: 400k-500k\n\nGrin (GRIN) was launched in January 2019. The project is focused on privacy and scalability. Like Beam, the Grin blockchain employs the MimbleWimble algorithm to support transactional privacy. For the home miner, though, it is the blockchain\u2019s ASIC-resistant POW algorithm that is most relevant. Moreover, the project developers have gone a step further to hard code a hard fork every six months to minimize the effects of any ASICS that may be developed specifically for its network.\n\nHow To Mine Grin\n\nTo get started with \u201cGRINning\u201d, download the blockchain from the official website to set up a node. Once you have successfully synced the blockchain, you must connect the node to your wallet. Creating your wallet is a simple matter of running a file in the directory. Once the wallet is live, you must then configure your graphics cards to work with the wallet. Finally, remember to set the software to the Cuckaroo POW, which is the version of the Grin network that supports GPU mining. Grin supports both CPU and GPU mining. However, if you decide to go the GPU way, purchase Nvidia cards because these are considered more effective. Moreover, you must have a minimum of 5.5 GB space to begin mining the coin. Once mined, exchanges that trade Grin include Bittrex and HitBTC.\n\nCheck current GRIN price\n\nAEON (AEON)\n\nMarket Cap: $1.3M Average Daily Volume: $50-$220+\n\nAEON was originally forked from Monero and based on the CryptoNote protocol. It uses the CryptoNight-Lite algorithm and ring signatures to make sure that transactions are untraceable.\n\nHow To Mine AEON\n\nAlthough AEON Is modelled after Monero, the project has chosen to forgo ASIC resistance. That said, AEON can still be mined with Windows CPUs, and AMB and Nvidia GPUs. More info on mining AEON can be found here. Once mined, Exchanges that trade AEON include Bittrex and HitBTC. Check current AEON price\n\nHow much money can you make GPU crypto mining at home?\n\nMining crypto at home with a CPU is possible with coins like Monero, Zcash and Byte, but it will be a slow process and the cost of electricity may be more than the value of the coins you can mine. For those who want to get more serious, crypto GPU mining is a realistic path. GPUs such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 and GeForce RTX 3080 are popular options. The price of GPUs range from as low as $600 up to $2000 and more. The reason for the price differential is all about performance. For GPUs this relates to their maximum hashrate.\n\nIn simple terms, hashrate is the amount of power/speed/calculation that the GPU unit can apply to mining a cryptocurrency. The hashrate is expressed in \u2018million hashes per second\u2019. So 1MH/s is one million hashes per second. Lower-cost GPUs typically have lower hashrates. CPUs on desktops and laptops have lower hashrates still, and are measured in thousand hashes per second as opposed to millions \u2013 so TH/S.\n\nThe hashrate and revenue calculation\n\nHashrates.com is an excellent resource for calculating potential earnings. It displays hashrates for both CPUs and GPUs and an estimate on how much one could make per month applying that hashrate to mining cryptocurrency. For example, Hashrates.com says a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU can operate at 48MH/s and would earn $217 a month mining Ethereum. In comparison, an Intel i9-10900 can operate at 4KH/s and would produce around $9 worth of Monero over the same period. Two other factors influencing profitability are:\n\nThe market price of the coin you are mining. Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile \u2013 so mining a crypto that is trending up will make you more money than one that is flat or trending down.\n\nThe cost of electricity. A basic rule of thumb for a GPU is the higher the hashrate it can produce, the more electricity it will use. The price of electricity worldwide is measured in kilowatt-hours.\n\n\n\nElectricity prices vary widely in the US. Source \u2013 Electricity prices vary widely in the US. Source \u2013 EnergyBot\n\nAccording to EnergyBot, the average price per kilowatt-hour in the U.S is currently 16.11 cents \u2013 but the price varies widely between states. The least expensive state is currently Idaho at 7.99 cents per kWh, and Hawaii is the most expensive at 43.18 cents. Worldwide, the lowest price electricity can be found in Burma, with many Arab states also offering very low rates.\n\nHow to scale up GPU mining \u2013 case study\n\nThe following case study was written by a professional GPU miner. In it they detail their real-world experience in GPU mining on a more commercial scale.\n\nThe technology set\n\nWe have 13 desktops that are low-cost Intel systems running Windows 10. The key here is finding motherboards that support 8 GPUs or more. Most run Z390 chipsets which are 8th/9th Gen Intel CPUs as the motherboards are readily available on Amazon. Speed is irrelevant as some systems run Celeron and some Intel i9 but mining will be 100% GPU dependent so no difference in speed. This is the area where you can cut corners to save on costs.\n\nWindows is not stable with more than 8 GPUs running. We utilize Windows to remote connect to each rig on our phones with Google Chrome. We do not recommend running anything larger because of stability and also because you would need Linux. All rigs run in an open frame with 120mm cooling fans to dissipate heat. The GPUs will thermal throttle down if not cooled or housed in a case.\n\nThe profitability equation\n\nEthereum has proven to be the most profitable crypto to mine per wattage. For a low-cost rig, 8 AMD RX580\u2019s generate $20 per day before electricity. I recommended 8 \u2013 AMD 5700 XT\u2019s because they use the same amount of electricity as the RX580s while generating 30% more profit. Electricity is your number one hurdle for profitability during a bear market. During a bull market it\u2019s not really a factor. For example, the rigs above utilize $4 per day in electricity. During a bear market with all 13 machines operating, we were able to generate around $500 a month. During the current bull market the same 13 machines have done up to $17,000 per month \u2013 so the power price is not an issue. The problem with electricity is scaling and heat. The rigs use 1000 watts so they are essentially 1000 watt space heaters. The more rigs you utilize the more you will then need to cool your residence depending on your space and goals.\n\nCrypto mining by at-home miners is challenging as large-scale operations dominate the mining industry. However, by choosing the most profitable coins and running the latest (and most efficient) mining hardware, it is still possible to generate crypto mining profits in 2023.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nBest crypto interest rates 2023 \u2013 DeFi and CeFi\n\nHow to Earn Interest & Boost Yield With Bitcoin and Crypto"

        "content": "Bitcoin has dropped more than 30% from when Warren Buffett described it as 'rat poison squared': Here are 3 stocks he's invested in that outperformed crypto\n\nBillionaire Warren Buffett memorably described Bitcoin as \u201crat poison squared\u201d during a shareholder meeting in April 2022. Bitcoin was trading near $40,000 at the time. It\u2019s now trading at around $36,288.\n\nMeanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Class A stock has outperformed the cryptocurrency and recently reached an all-time high, surpassing $560,000. Presently, the Class A stock sits above $545,000.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlord\n\nRising prices are throwing off Americans' retirement plans \u2014 here's how to get your savings back on track\n\n'A natural way to diversify': Janet Yellen now says Americans should expect a decline in the USD as the world's reserve currency \u2014 3 ways you can prepare\n\nUnsurprisingly, Buffett hasn\u2019t changed his mind about the world\u2019s most persistent digital obsession. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people do stupid things all my life,\u201d Buffett said in an interview with CNBC earlier this year, comparing betting on Bitcoin to playing the slots in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had an explosion of gambling, essentially. And I like to bet on a football game \u2014 if I\u2019m sitting and watching, it makes it more interesting. But I don\u2019t think I want to make a living trying to bet against the house.\u201d\n\nInstead of crypto, Buffett has been laser-focused on his preferred asset class: equities. Here are the top three stocks he\u2019s invested in over the past year that have outperformed Bitcoin by a wide margin.\n\nLennar Corp.\n\nBuffett seems to be focused on American homebuilders right now. He added a stake in Lennar Corporation (LEN) sometime in the second quarter of 2023, according to recent regulatory filings.\n\nThe Florida-based company is one of the largest home builders in the country. That puts it in a favorable position given the shortage of homes across America. Between 2012 and 2022, there were 6.5 million more households formed than homes constructed. If this gap continues to widen, demand for homebuilding could skyrocket.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett seems to be betting on this trend, adding two other homebuilders, NVR (NVR) and DR Horton (DHI), to his portfolio during the second quarter.\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nDiageo\n\nIn the first quarter of the year, Buffett added a stake in British alcoholic beverage giant Diageo (DEO). But the Oracle of Omaha is no stranger to sin stocks, having acquired a sizable stake in Guinness, the beer brand that would eventually be combined with other brands to form Diageo, back in the 1990s.\n\nAt the time, Buffett even compared the investment to his most famous bet. \u201cIn the sense of where they earn their profits \u2014 continent-by-continent \u2014 Coca-Cola and Guinness display strong similarities,\" he wrote in a letter to investors that year.\n\nNow, Diageo is back in the Berkshire portfolio, and that\u2019s probably a sign that the company is undervalued. The stock trades at just under 19 times earnings per share and offers a 2.57% dividend yield. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's dividend yield is 0% and has a non-existent price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nOccidental Petroleum\n\nWarren Buffett is clearly bullish on energy, at least in the medium term. That\u2019s why he started accumulating a stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY) last year and now controls over 25% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares.\n\nThe price of crude oil has rebounded in recent months. In fact, it hit a 10-month high recently and experts expect demand to keep a price floor on the commodity for the year ahead. That\u2019s a major tailwind for oil producers like Occidental.\n\nBuffett\u2019s bet on energy giants is now a key part of his portfolio. Considering how cheap these companies are (Occidental stock trades at 11 times earnings), retail investors should consider taking a closer look too.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

However, he emphasized that the journey ahead won\u2019t be without challenges.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on Nov. 16, Belshe explained that based on discussions between firms seeking Bitcoin ETF approval and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), he holds an optimistic view that approval is imminent.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that improving the market structure is a must before the SEC grants ultimate approval for a Bitcoin ETF:\n\n\u201cI think it is quite likely we have another round of ETF rejections before we get the positive news.\u201d\n\nBelshe reiterated the SEC\u2019s stance on separating crypto exchanges from custodians, emphasizing that this condition must be addressed before approval.\n\nFurthermore, he referenced Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, claiming that he was trying to make FTX a multifaceted operation:\n\n\u201c15 months ago we had Sam Bankman-Fried marching all over Washington D.C. advocating his seven key points of regulations.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating above $35,000 for several days, but the bulls have failed to resume the uptrend above $38,000. This suggests hesitation to buy at higher levels. BitGo CEO Mike Belshe said in a recent interview with Bloomberg that there is likely to be another round of rejections of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications before they are finally approved.\n\nMultiple analysts believe Bitcoin will enter a correction in the near term, with the worst outcome projecting a drop to $30,000. However, the fall is unlikely to start a bear phase. Look Into Bitcoin creator Philip Swift said that on-chain data suggests that the Bitcoin bull market is still in its early stages as there is \u201cno FOMO yet.\u201d\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAs Bitcoin takes a breather, several altcoins have witnessed a pullback, but some show signs of resuming their uptrends. Fidelity and BlackRock\u2019s applications for a spot Ether ETF show strong demand for investment in select altcoins.\n\nCould Bitcoin stay above $35,000 over the next few days? Is it time for altcoins to start the next leg of their up-move? Let\u2019s look at the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may rise in the short term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin faces stiff resistance near $38,000, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $35,666.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive zone indicate that bulls have the upper hand. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to overcome the roadblock at $38,000.\n\nIf they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair may reach $40,000. This level may witness aggressive selling by the bears, but if buyers bulldoze their way through, the rally could eventually touch $48,000.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a close below the 20-day EMA. That will indicate the possibility of a range-bound action in the near term. The pair may remain stuck between $34,800 and $38,000 for a while. A break below $34,800 could clear the path for a decline to $32,400.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the price is swinging between $38,000 and $34,800. Both moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating that the range-bound action may continue for some more time.\n\nA tight consolidation near the 52-week high is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are not closing their positions in a hurry. That increases the likelihood of an upside breakout. If that happens, the pair may resume the uptrend. The short-term trend will favor the bears on a break below $34,800.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nSolana (SOL) fell below the breakout level of $59 on Nov. 16, but the bears could not capitalize on this advantage. This indicates that selling dries up at lower levels.\n\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls are again trying to propel the price back above $59. If they do that, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the lower levels. The SOL/USDT pair may then climb to $68.20. If this level is scaled, the pair may resume the uptrend. The next target on the upside is $77 and subsequently $95.\n\nThis bullish move will be invalidated if the price turns down and plummets below $48. That could start a steeper correction to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $35.47. The deeper the fall, the longer the time it will take for the next leg of the uptrend to begin.\n\nSOL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA is flattening out, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If buyers shove the price above $64, the pair may challenge the local high at $68.20.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price turns down and breaks below $54, it will suggest that the bears are back in the game. The pair may then plunge to $51 and eventually to the strong support at $48. A break below this level will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nChainlink price analysis\n\nChainlink\u2019s (LINK) pullback is finding support at the 20-day EMA ($13.42), indicating that lower levels continue to attract buyers.\n\nLINK/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will next try to push the price to the local high of $16.60. This level may witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears, but if this barrier is overcome, the LINK/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend to $20.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down from $15.38, it will indicate that bears are selling on rallies. They will then try to sink the price below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $13.55. If they manage to do that, the pair may tumble to the 50-day SMA ($10.54).\n\nLINK/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair has declined in a descending channel pattern for the past few days. Generally, traders sell near the channel\u2019s resistance line, and that is what they are doing. If the price skids below $13.36, it will open the doors for a fall to the support line.\n\nContrarily, if buyers kick the price above the channel, it will suggest that the correction may be over. The pair may first rise to $15.38 and subsequently to $16.60. The flattish 20-EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage to the bulls or the bears.\n\nRelated: One year on: Top 3 gainers after the \u2018FTX crash bottom\u2019\n\nNear Protocol price analysis\n\nNear Protocol (NEAR) rose and closed above the formidable resistance of $1.72 on Nov. 17. This move indicates a potential trend change in the short term.\n\nNEAR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe rising 20-day EMA ($1.58) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate that the bulls are in charge. There is a minor resistance at $2. The NEAR/USDT pair may rise to $2.40 if this obstacle is cleared.\n\nMeanwhile, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back below the breakout level of $1.72 and trap the aggressive bulls. The pair may then fall to the 20-day EMA. This remains the critical level to watch out for because a drop below it will indicate that the sellers are back in the game.\n\nNEAR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair has been sustaining above the breakout level of $1.72, but the bulls have failed to start a strong up-move. This suggests that the bears have not given up and are trying to pull the price back below $1.72.\n\nIf they can pull it off, the price may drop to $1.60. If this level gives way, several stops may get triggered. The pair may then tumble to $1.45 and thereafter to $1.28. Contrarily, if buyers shove the price above $1.95, the pair may start its march toward $2.10.\n\nTheta Network price analysis\n\nTheta Network (THETA) is finding support at the 20-day EMA ($0.88) after going through a correction in the past few days. This indicates that the sentiment remains positive, and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nTHETA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe rebound off the 20-day EMA is likely to face resistance at the psychological level of $1. If this level is conquered, the THETA/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rise to $1.05 and later to $1.20. This level may again act as a strong hurdle, but if cleared, the pair may soar to $1.33.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the rally, they will have to quickly pull the price back below the 20-day EMA. That will indicate that the bulls may be rushing to the exit. The pair may then start a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($0.72).\n\nTHETA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair has been correcting inside a falling wedge, which usually acts as a bullish setup. Buyers will need to break and sustain the price above the wedge to signal strength. The pair may first rise to $1.05 and thereafter retest the resistance at $1.20.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the resistance line, it will suggest that the pair may remain stuck inside the wedge for some more time. The sentiment is likely to turn bearish on a slide below the wedge.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
