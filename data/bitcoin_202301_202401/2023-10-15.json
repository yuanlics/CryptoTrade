        "title": "Cryptocurrencies rise, sending bitcoin over $30,000 at one point, on optimism for a new ETF - CNBC",
        "content": "At one point Monday morning, bitcoin surged above $30,000 in a sudden spike on an unconfirmed report that the iShares spot bitcoin ETF had been formally approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the coin quickly gave up those gains as that report was unable to be confirmed by major media. BlackRock told CNBC the iShares Bitcoin ETP application is still under review by the SEC. Sources close to the SEC said that Monday's report was not accurate.\n\nCryptocurrencies jumped to start the week as hopeful investors weighed the likelihood that the U.S. will finally see a bitcoin ETF in the coming months.\n\nIn recent trading, bitcoin rose about 5.28% to $28,454.17, according to Coin Metrics, while ether added 1.86% to trade at $1,589.10.\n\nLast week, bitcoin had jumped on Friday on news that the SEC would not appeal a ruling in Grayscale's lawsuit against regulators. In June of 2022, Grayscale sued the SEC over its denial of the company's application to convert the popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF.\n\n\"The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure's 45-day period to seek rehearing has now passed. The Court will now issue its final mandate within seven calendar days,\" a Grayscale spokeswoman told CNBC. \"The Grayscale team remains operationally ready to convert GBTC to an ETF upon the SEC's approval, and we look forward to sharing more information as soon as practicable.\"\n\nIt's possible the SEC could again deny Grayscale's request, but the commission has recently been losing momentum in its attempt to broadly regulate crypto, with Grayscale in particular proving an obstacle. For example, the D.C. Court of Appeals called the SEC's denial \"arbitrary and capricious.\" Many investors read Friday's news as a signal that the SEC could be close to allowing Grayscale to list GBTC shares.\n\n\"Many people think the fact that the SEC chose to ask questions is a change of behavior and therefore I do think hopes are rising that a or a number of bitcoin ETFs will be approved,\" Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" Monday.\n\nTo be sure, bitcoin is coming off its worst week since Aug. 18 and first negative week in six. It lost 4.35% for the week, closing at $26,755.66, according to Coin Metrics. Ether lost 6.36% for the week and ended the week at $1,544.24.\n\nBitcoin and ether may also be benefiting from worries about a recession, which has Paul Tudor Jones last week to Bernstein this morning touting bitcoin as a safe haven trade in an uncertain macroeconomy.\n\nStill, the price of bitcoin is under some pressure as the regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. crypto industry has investors apathetic about boosting their positions. As a result, the market has been plagued by low volume and liquidity and bitcoin has been unable to reach new highs above $30,000.\n\nThe optimism Monday morning lifted other crypto assets. Ripple's XRP and Binance Coin , the top coins by market cap behind bitcoin and ether excluding stablecoins, were higher by 1.77% and 2.42%, respectively. Smart contracts platform Solana's sol token was up 9% and Polygon's matic token added 2.8%.\n\nCrypto equities, which have also struggled recently, are outperforming crypto assets. On Monday morning Coinbase was higher by more than 2% in early trading. Mining stocks including Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital , were up about 5% across the board.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Jesse Pound, Nick Wells and John Melloy contributed reporting.\n\nDon't miss these CNBC PRO stories:"

        "content": "Bitcoin soared but then pared back gains following a now-debunked rumor that the first amid a flurry of applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF had been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe cryptocurrency jumped 5.6%, to as high as $29,483, following the rumor published Monday morning, according to CoinGecko. It stopped just short of the $30,000 level, which Bitcoin hasn\u2019t reached since August, but was still up about 4.9%, at $28,200, just before noon.\n\nThe rumor, spurred by a now-deleted post on X by CoinTelegraph, claimed that the SEC had approved BlackRock\u2019s iShares spot Bitcoin ETF, which the asset manager filed in June. BlackRock\u2019s filing led to a wave of copycats, including WisdomTree, Invesco, and Fidelity, which all submitted or updated existing spot Bitcoin ETF filings. The new rush of filings was widely seen as a boon for the crypto space that could lead to an increase in investor funds in the sector.\n\nWhile some analysts have said odds are that the first spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved by the end of the year, the SEC has made no such promises. The agency lost a case earlier this year against Grayscale in which the court found that its refusal to grant Grayscale a Bitcoin ETF was without basis. A spot Bitcoin ETF has yet to be approved in the U.S.\n\nBloomberg reported on Friday that the SEC would not appeal the Grayscale decision, which makes it more likely, although not guaranteed, that a spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved sooner rather than later.\n\nCoinTelegraph said in an updated X post on Monday that it was investigating what led to the incorrect tweet about BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF."

A number of futures-based bitcoin ETFs already exist in the U.S.\n\nIn light of the bitcoin price spike after the erroneous report Monday, some investors now believe that the eventual approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. isn't entirely priced into the bitcoin market. \"We can safely conclude the following ... Bitcoin ETFs were not and are not priced in,\" Altana Digital Currency Fund Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Alistair Milne posted on X Monday.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg analysts, there is a 90% chance that a spot bitcoin ETF gets approved by January."

        "title": "Fight to launch spot bitcoin ETF in the US passes another hurdle - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe long-running fight to launch a US exchange traded fund investing directly in bitcoin has passed another hurdle after the regulator declined to contest a court ruling made against it.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission had until Friday to appeal against an August federal appeals court ruling that it had been wrong to reject an application from cryptocurrency house Grayscale Investments to convert its $16.7bn Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world largest crypto fund, into an ETF.\n\nJudge Neomi Rao, writing for a three-judge panel, said the SEC had been \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in failing to explain why it had rejected applications for \u201cspot\u201d bitcoin ETFs \u2014 which invest directly in the digital token \u2014 while giving the green light to ETFs trading in bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nInvestors reacted to the deadline passing for an SEC appeal by cutting GBTC\u2019s discount to net asset value to about 14 per cent, according to Bloomberg, its narrowest margin since November 2021, having hit a record 48.9 per cent in December 2022. Bitcoin rose 3.7 per cent to $27,757 between Friday and noon UK time on Monday on the news, before spiking above $28,000 on unfounded reports that a rival BlackRock spot bitcoin ETF had been approved, a rumour later denied by both BlackRock and the SEC.\n\nGiven that the discount is expected to disappear entirely if the private trust is able to convert into an ETF, it is widely perceived as a barometer of investors\u2019 expectations.\n\nTodd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a consultancy said the SEC\u2019s decision not to appeal suggested the future launch of spot bitcoin ETF looked more likely.\n\n\u201cCombined with the regulator\u2019s ongoing interactions with other asset managers seeking to launch a spot bitcoin ETF is a sign that a US spot bitcoin ETF is more likely to come to market in the near future. We could see new products trading in early 2024 after years of the SEC rejecting such plans.\u201d\n\nGrayscale said it \u201cremains operationally ready to convert GBTC to an ETF upon the SEC\u2019s approval\u201d.\n\nThe regulator had based its opposition to GBTC\u2019s conversion on a view that bitcoin, which trades on unregulated exchanges, is prone to fraud and market manipulation, whereas bitcoin futures were an acceptable asset for a mainstream retail fund because they traded on regulated venues such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision not to appeal against the ruling now leaves it with the option of opposing GBTC\u2019s conversion on alternative grounds or ultimately approving it, which would seemingly open the floodgates to a wave of spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAlongside Grayscale, 10 other managers, including BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest money manager, Fidelity, Ark Invest, WisdomTree, VanEck and Valkyrie, have outstanding filings in place to launch spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSeveral of these applicants have amended their filings in recent days to say that their assets would be held in segregated accounts by their custodian and not commingled with either corporate or other customer assets.\n\nThe list of risk factors has also been extended in many cases. Ark, for instance, in its joint filing with 21Shares now refers to \u201cthe actual or perceived use of bitcoin and other digital assets in illicit transactions, which may adversely affect the bitcoin industry and an investment in the trust\u201d.\n\nIt further says that \u201cdigital asset mining operations can consume significant amounts of electricity, which may have a negative environmental impact and give rise to public opinion against allowing, or government regulations restricting, the use of electricity for mining operations\u201d.\n\nThe fact that many of the applicants have adopted additional wording has given rise to speculation that the SEC is actively engaging with them rather than planning to reject the filings outright, as it has done with every application for the past decade.\n\nBradley Duke, chief strategist at ETC Group, a provider of crypto exchange traded products, said that while it was possible the SEC might find another reason to oppose spot bitcoin ETFs \u201cit\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult for them to do that\u201d.\n\n\u201cMore and more of the largest American financial services firms are opening up some sort of bitcoin or crypto-backed business,\u201d Duke said, mentioning the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity and Charles Schwab.\n\n\u201cThere is a feeling of inevitability around crypto and a spot bitcoin ETF in the US,\u201d he added, with Patrick McHenry, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, last month criticising the SEC\u2019s \u201ccrusade against the digital assets ecosystem\u201d, which he argued had caused \u201clasting damage\u201d.\n\nSimilar exchange traded products already exist in Canada and Europe, where their advent has so far proved uncontentious.\n\n\u201cWe have had the equivalent of spot bitcoin ETFs in Europe for many years and they have traded well and efficiently with no problems,\u201d Duke added.\n\nRosenbluth believed the SEC would be likely to follow the pattern it set with this month\u2019s rollout of futures-based ETFs investing in ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, when it created a level playing field by allowing several ETFs to list on the same day, \u201crather than giving one firm a first-mover advantage,\u201d as it did with the ProShares Bitcoin Trust (BITO), the first US futures-based bitcoin ETF to launch in October 2021.\n\nArk and the SEC both declined to comment.\n\nThe advent of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US would be seen as potentially opening the way for greater mainstream investment in the cryptocurrency industry, given ETFs\u2019 status as a cheap, safe and well-understood regulatory wrapper.\n\nRegistered investment advisers, which are typically only permitted to invest in listed, regulated assets, would also have access to spot crypto for client portfolios for the first time."

Instead, the reason for the SEC folding its cards probably lies in the fact that its legal resources are already stretched thin in light of Gensler\u2019s campaign against crypto\u2014and because the three judges in the case totally shredded the SEC\u2019s rationale for denying the ETF in the first place.\n\nThe upshot is that a long-awaited Bitcoin ETF is coming to U.S. shores sooner than later, and that an Ethereum one will likely arrive not long after that. What is less clear is which company will offer it and what this development will mean for long-slumping crypto markets.\n\nAs Fortune has reported in detail, Grayscale has been the face of the legal fight to push the SEC to green-light a Bitcoin ETF, a type of fund that\u2019s been available for years in Europe and Canada. But as the court proceedings began to look more favorable for Grayscale, some of the biggest names in finance\u2014most notably BlackRock and Fidelity\u2014filed applications to offer one, too. Given that it would be safer in terms of optics for the SEC to give the prize to a familiar name from traditional finance, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if Gensler processes the applications in a way that lets a company like BlackRock go first.\n\nThe more intriguing question, though, is the second one\u2014what a long-awaited ETF means for the crypto markets. For years, the crypto industry has hyped the impending arrival of institutional money as a game changer that will turbocharge the markets by bringing in billions of dollars of new capital and drive up prices. I think there is something to this argument and, in the context of the impending ETF, it\u2019s easy to imagine giant asset managers nudging their numerous clients to add a small slice of Bitcoin to their portfolios.\n\nA troubling thought for the industry, though, is what if this doesn\u2019t happen? What if the door to institutional money finally swings open but few people choose to walk through it? For months now, crypto prices have scuffled along at respectable levels\u2014Bitcoin is up 75% since the start of the year\u2014but volumes have dropped to levels not seen in years. This has created the impression that crypto is pass\u00e9 and shaken the confidence of some in the industry. A big ETF-fueled price rally would turn this narrative around in a hurry and provide some much-needed enthusiasm\u2014but if no rally materializes, the pressure will only grow for the crypto industry to prove that current conditions are about to change.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nAn investigation of Garantex reveals the Russian crypto exchange has, despite U.S. sanctions, expanded to become a big player in cross-border finance where it specializes in ruble-Tether transactions.

        "title": "Bitcoin's Lightning Network Scaling Solution Seeks Resurgence After Losing Way - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- When Bitcoin development company Lightning Labs first launched the Lightning Network in 2018, it was all the rage. The protocol, built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, was designed to make cryptocurrency transactions faster and cheaper.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAt the time, Lightning Labs had raised $2.5 million of seed financing from investors including Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey and PayPal\u2019s David Sacks, who dubbed it \u201cthe most important protocol being built on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBut soon after launching, murmurs of failed transactions on the Lightning Network began popping up on X, and suddenly, the next big thing for Bitcoin seemed anything but. Users reported liquidity issues and security vulnerabilities, creating a perception that the Lightning Network was an over-complicated, unreliable protocol.\n\nRead More: The \u2018Blockchain Trilemma\u2019 That\u2019s Holding Back Crypto: QuickTake\n\nAs the volume of activity on Bitcoin increases, transactions can become slower and costlier. The reason Bitcoin transactions take a while to process is the underlying technology, which ensures decentralization and security by recording each transaction on an encrypted chain.\n\nThe demand for so-called \u201cLayer-2\u201d scaling solutions like Lightning Network has only grown, but those for Bitcoin in particular, have struggled with capital constraints. About 99% of venture capital investments over the past few years flowed into other crypto products, not Bitcoin, according to a 2022 report by Trammell Venture Partners. Since its inception, Lightning Labs has raised $82.5 million in funding compared with one of Ethereum\u2019s leading Layer-2 solutions, Polygon, which brought around $450 million in its latest funding round.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhen the Bitcoin scaling wars were happening from 2015 to 2017, it was decided that Lightning Network was going to be the layered approach that Bitcoin would pursue,\u201d Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, said in an interview. \u201cBut Bitcoin itself is a very difficult protocol to change. And whenever there has been change, it\u2019s been highly contentious.\u201d\n\nRead More: Technology Meant to Make Bitcoin Money Again Goes Live\n\nOn the Rise Again\n\nThe protocol was first proposed by Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon in 2015 as a solution to Bitcoin\u2019s scaling limitations. While traditional digital payment companies like Visa can process around 24,000 transactions per second, Bitcoin can only process seven. Lightning Network seemed to be on the path to change that.\n\n\u201cHistorically, Bitcoin has not been the place where venture capitalists tend to be focused,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThe Bitcoin space is very ideological, and a lot of Bitcoiners have a negative view of venture capital.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, two of the largest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, announced their integration with Lightning Network, joining companies like Lightspark, a crypto startup which works on Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network, and digital payments firm Strike.\n\nAlthough Coinbase was eying Lightning Network \u201cfor a long time,\u201d the technology only recently reached a place the exchange company felt \u201ca lot better about,\u201d Viktor Bunin, who leads the Protocol Operations team at Coinbase, said in a recent interview on the Galaxy Brains podcast.\n\n\u201cFor many years Lighting has been quite challenging to use and run,\u201d Bunin continued. \u201cThe non-custodial experience is still severely lacking relative to the custodial experience.\u201d\n\nBut, as a company that is \u201cunequivocally pro-Bitcoin,\u201d Bunin adds, Lightning Network\u2019s eventual integration only made sense for Coinbase.\n\nLightning Labs and Binance did not respond to a request for comment. Coinbase declined to comment.\n\nBitcoin rose about 2% to $27,760 on Monday in New York. That\u2019s less than half the record high of almost $69,000 reached in November 2021.\n\n\u2018An Integral Step\u2019\n\nLast year, Lightning Labs announced the creation of Taproot Assets, formerly known as Taro, a protocol that allows users to instantly transfer other digital currencies, like stablecoin and nonfungible tokens, on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nChristopher Calicott, managing director of Trammell Venture Partners, said Taproot Assets is an integral step to Lightning Network\u2019s development, as wider adoption is one of the primary obstacles the Layer-2 solution faces. A 2022 report by Arcane Research said that more than 80 million people have access to Lightning Network.\n\nWhile Lightning Network theoretically has the capability to support one million transactions per second, its ability to reach that potential is dependent on its wide-scale usability. And as a peer-to-peer network, it\u2019s difficult to gage how many transactions are happening at any given point, according to Graham Krizek, the founder & CEO of Voltage, a Lightning as a Service (LaaS) provider.\n\nRead More: Valor, Brevan Howard Back Lightning to \u2018Bitcoinize the Dollar\u2019\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to ask everyone that\u2019s using Lightning Network how many transactions they are doing, how frequently, all of those things to really calculate it,\u201d Krizek said.\n\nHis company Voltage was established in 2020 after he found Lightning Network difficult to understand and use, even as a developer. But compared to Lightning Network\u2019s early days, Krizek said he\u2019s optimistic about its future.\n\n\u201cNow there\u2019s a whole ecosystem, where you can use Lightning for not only depositing and withdrawing from Binance, but also in social networks or even traditional finance,\u201d Krizek said. \u201cThere are a lot of more applications to it now and will continue to be, particularly in back end systems.\u201d\n\nSome, like Carter, remain skeptical of the Layer-2 solution\u2019s ability to transform even Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very high mental cost involved in learning to use the Lightning protocol yourself,\u201d Carter said. \u201cBut as a different payment technology for digitally native content, I think that\u2019s where it\u2019ll find its niche.\u201d\n\n(Updates to add the price of Bitcoin.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P."

But has cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology fully landed in Europe?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZug, a small Swiss canton nestled by a shimmering lake and framed by the Alps, is famous for its traditional cherry pie - which was particularly loved by actress Audrey Hepburn - and for its blockchain start-up hub.\n\nThere you may not be able to pay for your coffee in Bitcoin just yet, but you'll find yourself surrounded by folks working in crypto - who are actually able to pay their taxes in Bitcoin.\n\nIn this new episode of the Euronews Tech Talks podcast, we visit Zug, the heart of Europe's so-called \"Crypto Valley\", talk about trust in decentralised banking systems, and see how renewable energy sources are changing Bitcoin mining in Europe.\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain companies have spread very quickly in the European area between Switzerland, Liechtenstein and northern Italy.\n\nAccording to recent research by CV VC, a Zug-based venture capital firm, there are more than 1,100 blockchain-related entities thriving between Switzerland, Liechtenstein and northern Italy.\n\nThese companies employ nearly 6,000 people and are worth a combined $185 billion, as of December 2022. That's more than the GDP of countries like Kuwait or Morocco.\n\nYet blockchain, the technology that underpins it, remains widely misunderstood and distrusted by Europeans.\n\nOver the next three episodes, the Euronews Tech Talks team will explore the world of blockchain from a European perspective to find answers to these questions: how is blockchain already impacting life in Europe? And will crypto ever become mainstream?\n\nBitcoin, the visible face of cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin, ether, tether, Dogecoin, Cardano. None of these terms existed before 2008, but over a decade later, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are radically disrupting the world of finance.\n\nBitcoin is the most recognisable among them. It was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. The name is a pseudonym for the mysterious person or persons who developed it. Blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrency, has its roots as far back as 1991, when two scientists Stewart Haber and Scott Tanita, proposed a system to protect timestamps on documents from being interfered with.\n\nUnlike traditional currencies issued by central banks, Bitcoin is not controlled by any government or financial institution. It allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries.\n\nBut blockchain technology goes beyond Bitcoin and crypto. In our next episode, we\u2019ll feature a conversation between two experts who will tell us how it works with web3, smart contracts and NFTs.\n\nEuronews Tech Talks Podcast: Unravelling Europe's Digital Landscape\n\nIn our previous episodes, we delved into the world of generative AI from a European perspective.\n\nDo you want to know if software such as ChatGPT or Dall-e are already replacing the workforce in Europe or if we are facing a nuclear winter or a robotic paradise?

        "content": "Since its inception 15 years ago this month, Bitcoin has become the star around which the rest of the blockchain industry revolves. It remains the most widely known and best-understood project in the broader crypto ecosystem, and it continues to galvanize interest in digital currencies across the world.\n\nOne thing that unites all Bitcoin holders is trust in unchangeable code. Every day, the network\u2019s miners convert real-world energy into a scarce digital asset that exists on an immutable public ledger. But one place where this trust has yet to take hold is traditional finance, where many big players are unwilling to hold Bitcoin outside of a familiar investment instrument.\n\nThere are any number of reasons for this state of affairs. Though the process of buying, storing, managing and transferring Bitcoin has gotten much simpler, it\u2019s still easy to misplace private keys or send Bitcoin to the wrong address \u2014 to say nothing of persistent concerns regarding its regulatory prospects. Ultimately, what this means is that traders operating within institutions beholden to restrictive investment rules have effectively been locked out of a promising and potentially highly profitable new arena.\n\nThe most obvious solution to this problem would be an exchange-traded fund specializing in Bitcoin. An ETF is a basket of investments that can be traded on a stock exchange. A spot Bitcoin ETF, therefore, is effectively the same thing as making Bitcoin tradeable on such an exchange. While self-custody is preferable for some folks, this would furnish a straightforward way for other investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without needing to directly manage it themselves.\n\nAbsent an ETF, investors \u2014 particularly institutions that aren\u2019t allowed to own Bitcoin directly \u2014 are limited to instruments like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. While GBTC indirectly grants exposure to Bitcoin, it doesn\u2019t allow for immediate redemptions. This means that at various times it has traded at either sizable premiums or sizable discounts to Bitcoin, leading to incredibly inefficient cryptoasset markets. An ETF would allow many more investors to get direct exposure to Bitcoin, including major institutions that will bring an air of legitimacy to the broader digital asset space.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow close are we to a Bitcoin ETF in the United States? The short answer is: much closer than we were even a few months ago. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington D.C. recently sided with Grayscale in its attempt to overrule the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s denial of their earlier request to establish a Bitcoin ETF. A few months before that the largest asset management company in the world, BlackRock, submitted its own proposal for a Bitcoin ETF, with many other blue-chip institutions following suit. Outside of the U.S., recent efforts in this direction have included the introduction of Europe\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF, along with multiple successful approvals of Bitcoin ETFs in Canada over the past two years.\n\nIn addition to various other legal and economic justifications, global analysts offer these two examples as proof of the inevitability of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. JPMorgan\u2019s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou recently stated that the SEC would either be forced to approve GBTC\u2019s Bitcoin ETFs or would have to suffer the embarrassment of retroactively withdrawing a prior approval of similar ETFs based on futures contracts. Bloomberg\u2019s James Seyffart, in addition, predicted that spot Bitcoin ETF approvals would be a \u201cdone deal\u201d by 2024.\n\nAt this point, the destination is inevitable; how much longer it takes to get there remains to be seen.\n\nAs for the question of \u201cwhy now,\u201d two core reasons stand out as especially important. First, in a world marked by a growing distrust of authority, Bitcoin represents a comforting mathematical certainty. A core tenet of Bitcoin is that its supply is capped at 21 million, making it one of the only assets whose supply is completely unaffected by demand. Given that increasing Bitcoin\u2019s supply ahead of its pre-programmed emissions schedule is impossible, the only way to address an increase in demand is to make it more accessible with instruments like ETFs.\n\nThe second reason stems from the fact that more and more people are building on top of the underlying Bitcoin network. Earlier this year, NFTs and fungible tokens were introduced to the Bitcoin blockchain, causing demand for network capacity to skyrocket. Though we\u2019re no doubt in the early stages of these developments, they are nevertheless glimpses into a future where Bitcoin contributes to the governance of complex systems with uniquely credible neutrality.\n\nAs things stand, Bitcoin is now attempting to gain access to the traditional financial system, but there is the intriguing possibility that it will compete with that system in a much more fundamental way. Rather than an ETF being a basket through which investors hold Bitcoin, for example, \u201ctokenization\u201d \u2014 the issuance of scarce digital tokens representing shares of ownership \u2014 could eventually be the means by which traditional assets are held in a decentralized way. This would increase transparency and available liquidity while simultaneously reducing the prevalence of fee-extracting intermediaries.\n\nAs an asset, Bitcoin is only the beginning. Its second-order effects will be truly vast."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly jumped on a report that BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF had been approved. It's a report that BlackRock denies, saying it's application is still being reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan tells Yahoo Finance Live that the \"tea leaves are pointing toward a potential approval.\" \"The SEC has previously been worried about market manipulation, about a lack of maturity in the market, but the bitcoin market of today is not the bitcoin market of a few years ago. It's an institutional market, with institutional players, and institutional custody,\" Hougan says. Watch the video above to find out what date Hougan says investors should be watching to find out if a spot bitcoin ETF is approved.\n\nClick here to watch the full interview on the Yahoo Finance YouTube page or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, Bitcoin is among the big movers on Wall Street today. Crypto has been seeing wild swings as investors wait on a decision from the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs. There was a report early on in the day that the SEC had approved the iShares ETF. Bitcoin spiked on that news but pared those gains after BlackRock said the fund was still under review.\n\nJoining us now, Matt Hougan, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer. He's got his hat in the ring as well with these offerings. And everybody's been waiting to see if approval was going to come, Matt. What are you guys hearing? Any kind of glimmer of news from the SEC? And what do you think is the hold out here?\n\nMATT HOUGAN: Yeah. Well, thanks for having me on. Of course, I can't speak to Bitwise's filing or any specific filing. But I do think the tea leaves are pointing toward a potential approval. You know, we have major issuers like BlackRock, coming into the market, saying we're ready for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Firms like Bitwise who have been doing this for years have submitted additional research into this space.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think the time is right for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC has previously been worried about market manipulation, about a lack of maturity in the market. But the Bitcoin market of today is not the Bitcoin market of a few years ago. It's an institutional market with institutional players and institutional custody. And we're ready for an ETF that will make it cheaper and safer for Americans to invest in this exciting asset class.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: So Matt, when do you think-- and I realize, listen, you're reading tea leaves here, but when do you think the SEC could approve that spot Bitcoin ETF, Matt? Are you thinking, you know, by year-end? And when they do, Matt, do you think they should the SEC should approve all the Bitcoin ETFs here at once?\n\nMATT HOUGAN: Yeah. So the way this works is there's a calendar based system for every ETF that is applied for. And the date I would circle on your calendar is January 10. That's when the next ETF hits its final review date. The SEC has to say yes or no by that point.\n\nTowards the second part of your question, if we look at what happened in the Ethereum Futures ETF space, where those ETFs just launched two weeks ago, what we saw was the SEC lined up multiple providers to launch at once. I suspect the most likely scenario is the SEC will want to do the same thing here, give everyone an equal starting place, increase competition. And so I would circle that January 10 date. I don't mean on that date. I mean sometime between now and that date, we will find out if we are finally going to get the ETF."

        "content": "By Reuters\n\nBitcoin rose suddenly on Monday over a now-retracted media report.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBitcoin rose suddenly on Monday, before giving up nearly all its gains after asset manager BlackRock denied a crypto media report that US regulators had approved its high-profile application for a crypto investment product.\n\nBitcoin, known for its volatility, was last trading up 3.82% at $28,211 (around \u20ac26,600), after earlier rising as much as 10% to $29,900 (around \u20ac28,000), its highest since August.\n\nCrypto news outlet Coin Telegraph had earlier reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had approved an application by major asset manager BlackRock for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, before later retracting the story.\n\nBut bitcoin fell sharply after a Fox Business reporter said on the social media platform X (formerly called Twitter) that BlackRock denied the report.\n\nBlackRock later confirmed to Reuters that \"the iShares Bitcoin ETP application is still under review by the SEC.\" Sources close to the SEC also confirmed that the application is still pending.\n\n'Markets sensitive to good news'\n\n\"Crypto markets have just shown how sensitive they are to any potential good news, with their premature rally today on rumours of the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF,\" said Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at eToro.\n\nIn a post on X, Coin Telegraph apologised for its earlier post, which it said \"led to the dissemination of inaccurate information.\"\n\n\"An internal investigation is currently underway. We are committed to transparency and will share the findings of the investigation with the public once it is concluded within 3 hours,\" Coin Telegraph said. It also deleted its initial post.\n\nCrypto markets have been awaiting news on several pending spot bitcoin ETF applications, which, if approved, are widely expected to drive investment in the sector. The SEC has denied all spot bitcoin ETF applications on the grounds applicants have not shown they can protect investors from market manipulation.\n\n\"The move does show how monomaniacally obsessed the bitcoin market is with the coming spot ETFs,\" said Joseph Edwards, head of research at London crypto firm Enigma Securities.\n\nWhile the news about the SEC approving a spot bitcoin ETF on Monday was a \"false alarm,\" it was also a \"good dress rehearsal\" for when the regulator delivers a final decision on the applications, said Lucas Kiely, chief investment officer at Yield App.\n\n\"Headline risk is creating a lot of volatility ahead of this SEC announcement, with everyone trying to get ahead of it as the market will move markedly either way depending on the decision,\" he said.\n\nReuters was first to report on October 13 that the SEC would not appeal a recent court ruling that found it was wrong to reject an application from Grayscale Investments to create a spot bitcoin ETF, in a case that has been closely watched by the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Washington is now expected to issue a mandate within the next week specifying how its decision in the case should be executed, which will likely include instructing the SEC to revisit Grayscale's application."

        "content": "UPDATE: After the original story was published, BlackRock denied rumors, stating that the US regulatory commission did not grant permission for the creation of the first spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe much-anticipated approval of the iShares Bitcoin ETF may soon become a reality. A tweet from Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas cited Reuters as indicating that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing a green light for the financial product. While still awaiting official confirmation, this news has already stirred the cryptocurrency landscape, potentially paving the way for increased institutional investment in Bitcoin.\n\nSEC to Approve First Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nFor years, the idea of a Bitcoin Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that Read this Term ETF has captured the imagination and interest of investors. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) allow individuals to invest in an asset without owning it directly. In this context, the iShares Bitcoin ETF would give investors a convenient regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price changes without the need to own the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe original tip-off about the SEC's pending approval came from Benzinga, a financial news outlet. Balchunas later corroborated this by stating that it was also a headline on the Reuters terminal, thereby adding more weight to the claim. However, while Reuters is a trusted source, the SEC has yet to make an official announcement.\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nI just wonder if this is the news from Friday that Reuters broke that was SEC no going to appeal Grayscale being converted into approval news. Again, trying to 100% confirm this.. \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 16, 2023\n\nThe approval of this ETF could represent a watershed moment for institutional investors, who currently face various obstacles in investing in cryptocurrencies. Regulatory challenges and custody issues have historically deterred this sector. The ETF could provide a safer, more streamlined avenue for these investors, potentially stabilizing the market and boosting liquidity Liquidity The term liquidity refers to the process, speed, and ease of which a given asset or security can be converted into cash.

As such, the prudent approach would be to wait for an official announcement from the SEC.\n\nBitcoin Price Goes Up\n\nIn response to the unconfirmed news, Bitcoin's price rose by over 10% on Monday afternoon, breaking the $28,000 level.\n\n\u201cThe iShares Bitcoin spot ETF will be approved by US regulators, according to unconfirmed SEC filings.

        "content": "While Bitcoin (BTC -2.89%) has soared more than 60% in value in 2023, it's still also more than 60% below its all-time high from November 2021. The current price sits at just around $26,750, pressured by higher interest rates and uncertain economic backdrop.\n\nWith this top cryptocurrency trading below $30,000 for the past 2 1/2 months, investors might be smart to take a closer look at adding Bitcoin to their portfolios. Here are some compelling reasons that's a good move.\n\nNear-term catalysts\n\nLooking out even 12 months from now, it's possible that Bitcoin's price will be significantly higher than today, which means buying it for less than $30,000 would look like a real steal in hindsight. Some powerful potential catalysts are on the horizon in the near term.\n\nEvery four or so years, Bitcoin undergoes what's called a halving. This is when the amount miners are rewarded for processing transactions gets cut in half, essentially reducing the rate at which new coins are created. Looking at past halving cycles shows us that Bitcoin could see major bullish sentiment. Between the last halving on May 11, 2020, to Bitcoin's all-time high, the price skyrocketed 661%.\n\nBasic economic theory can explain what's going on. If Bitcoin's supply of new issuance gets cut in half but demand remains steady or even rises, there is support for a higher price. The next halving is scheduled for April of next year.\n\nThe biggest news coming from the world of Bitcoin in the past several months has been that huge asset management firms have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. While the SEC hasn't made any decisions yet, instead pushing back its deadlines, there is a lot of enthusiasm that these financial products will get approved.\n\nThe belief is that if this happens, the floodgates will open, introducing fresh capital -- and lots of it -- with a regulated, accessible, liquid, and easy way to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Should this happen, it could be viewed as a major milestone for Bitcoin, transforming it into a legitimate financial asset. And again, with higher demand, the price could soar.\n\nAnother catalyst, the most unpredictable, is the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Since March 2022, the central bank has been on an aggressive path of hiking interest rates with the sole intention of getting inflation back to its 2% target. There might be one more rate hike before 2023 ends.\n\nHowever, I have the view that interest rates will have to come down sooner rather than later, mainly due to how much debt the government carries. Unless the government wants interest payments to keep taking up a sizable chunk of public spending, a looser monetary policy, characterized by lower interest rates, will need to happen.\n\nA more accommodative Fed is usually the key ingredient for a very favorable backdrop for risky assets, Bitcoin included. Investors will go further down the risk curve to achieve better returns. And this, again, can be a boon for Bitcoin's price.\n\nPatience is key\n\nThese near-term catalysts could be powerful price drivers for Bitcoin, but their potential positive impact is far from a sure thing. I'm always skeptical of price targets any Wall Street analyst, economist, or strategist comes up with. The world is inherently uncertain, with a million different variables that can affect the prices of financial assets.\n\nLet me be clear. If you are indeed bullish on Bitcoin, do not buy it hoping that it shoots up in value in 12 months. Instead, add it to your portfolio with the intention of owning it for the next decade. There's a good chance your patience will be rewarded."

        "content": "It looks like the SEC won't appeal court ruling against gray scale as we reported here, the move boost the odds of the gray scale Bitcoin Trust uh potentially turning into a more appealing ETF So joining us now to discuss is the author of the crypto trader Glenn Goodman. Welcome back as always, Glenn. Good to be here. Glad to see you. OK. So, you know, we had this uh rally overnight uh overnight uh New York time, midday, Asia, what do you think drove it? Was it this enthusiasm about stuff that happened two or three days ago uh with a potential uh decision by the SEC of uh not appealing this uh this potential ETF uh from gray scale. Yeah, I think that that has to be the reason uh because stock markets which have been watching closely in the futures before opening and so on. Uh and in Asia uh are up a little bit, but they're not really showing the same kind of enthusiasm that the uh Bitcoin market is, which tells me that yes, it is uh a sort of renewed Asian excitement as in the Asian markets this morning to the idea that there might actually finally be this mythical, uh Bitcoin ETF that it might finally come to exist. Did, did what happened with the Ether ETF s that came to the market a few, a few weeks ago here. Uh Now we, you know, we saw about nine of them hit the market. The lackluster and performance did, is this, does this mean that potentially a spot ETF for Bitcoin is already priced in, uh, with, you know, maybe the SEC, if they're going to have to approve it, they'll just say, all right, we'll let them all go to the market and see if they'll fail. Like the, uh, ETF for, for the E futures, I don't think really, it's a matter of failing. It's just, you know, we're in a pretty boring time in the markets as you, as you talk about on the show, um, very often, you know, whenever I tune in quite a lot of the time, you're like, God, when are things gonna get more exciting and, you know, not young ones. If you, if you ever remember the show, the young ones, everything was boring. Everything was boring but like, are boring, you know, too much excitement is not always good at my age, at my age. No, I can't have excitement. I get very nervous. You'll remember the pop star, Cliff Richard was the only thing that excited you. That was only Rick though. Yeah, that's true. Uh, for, for those of you who never watch the show. You go, you gotta watch it. It's probably online anyway. Um, but, but, yeah, I mean, it's the thing about, about these ETF S is that they are going to succeed or fail based on excitement around the crypto space. And, ok, so, you know, this is not unusual. We're in the, the usual kind of part of the cycle where everything gets a bit boring. Now, I'm not the kind of person who necessarily believes that everything is preordained and that just because we've had the same cycle over and over again, you know, over the course of more than a decade now that it's going to repeat yet again in exactly the same way. In fact, we actually did see, of course, in this last cycle that something different happened because we'd always in the past in Bitcoin's price had a single big peak and then uh the decline would begin at the top of uh each, each uh cycle. But this last time round, of course, we had two peaks. We, we had one in uh about April May, uh 2021 and another one in November. So, you know, that was a, an unusual occurrence. So we can't take it for granted that the cycle is gonna repeat exactly the same way as last time. But so far, uh this bear market is playing out shape wise, you know, on the chart like that in, in very much the same way as it has done in previous cycles. And so therefore, we can kind of uh semi, I assume that next year, sometime we're going to start seeing the excitement building once again. And Bitcoin ETF s if they come to exist by then will benefit from that. I have no doubt. It's, it's just a matter of hype, excitement and narrative and frankly, the narrative that a Bitcoin ETF is now here and institutions can invest and retail uh ordinary retail investors can invest in it in a, in a more pain free way. I think that that will probably be one of the chief narratives going into the next cycle. Yes, you could argue that it's priced in and the idea of it happening is already priced in amongst the hardcore, the people who are still here and investing, but it's certainly not priced in among the uh the newer investors. And indeed people who've got bored with crypto, but we'll come back to it once prices start rising, Jen, I'll let you, I'll let you go in a second but it did my audio fail because I didn't hear the word having in any of that. You didn't say the word having, having, you did not say having, you did not, you did not talk about the Bitcoin having or having the halving I'm English. It was like having having that. That's the bit of New Jersey in me. Yeah. Um Yes, I mean that is significant actually, I was, I was looking at, uh, the various hals or HALS on my chart yesterday, over time and, you know, you can't get away from the conclusion that they do go inside rather neatly with, uh, with a sort of a little period of, of continued sideways movement and then a big takeoff. And again, it's, you know, I don't believe that anything is necessarily preordained and yet we have seen pretty much the same thing happen several times in a row. I don't think that's a coincidence. I think actually, rather than being um a supply constriction issue. I, I don't believe that because I believe the demand massively determines what happens in the Bitcoin and crypto markets, the demand skyrockets and then plummets, you know, that overwhelms any little change in supply that might happen with halving. But uh there is a self fulfilling prophecy element to the halving. As in it becomes a narrative. Everybody expects it to lead to uh a big price rise because it has done always in the past. And therefore, you know, people get in that mood, that buying mood, they get more optimistic, put that hand in hand with a spot, Bitcoin ETF and things line up quite nicely for, I would guess, you know, if we're gonna take a rough guess later on next year. All right, Glenn, we got to ask you for some predictions. So some market watchers are looking at this lack of appeal from the SEC in the gray scale suit, um, as an indicator that we could have a spot, Bitcoin ETF launch in January. Do you agree? And if you do, do you think that they're going to approve, you know, a bunch of ETF S at the same time like they did with Ether futures, ETF and remove that first mover advantage? Well, I've been, I've been studying it quite closely. Well, I mean, I had been anyway, but in preparation for this interview, I've read just about everything there is to try and work out what the chances are to try and gauge the chances. But, uh, it, it seems to me that ultimately, the sec haven't got much of a leg to stand on in terms of arguments. Yeah. Ok. They could put a few little roadblocks in the way saying, oh, well, you haven't quite sorted out arrangements for custody, uh, or, you know, we need a creation redemption function and don't forget you'll have to list on the New York Stock Exchange. You know, they could make things difficult and try and delay it a little bit longer, but they haven't any more after this court decision really got a major argument in their favor. What they do have though, of course, is Gary Gensler and his seeming, um, knee jerk dislike for all things, Bitcoin and crypto. And so even though they might have a strong argument, he's still the boss and maybe he will just find things to stop it from happening. But like you quite rightly pointed out, there are the likes of Blackrock and Fidelity now, you know, bearing down upon him, they want their ETF S approved. So they're going to be saying, you know, well, you haven't got any more excuses and they're pretty powerful. Who knows how scared he is of them or isn't of them? I suspect that they will have some influence because they're just such enormous players. And yes, if one Bitcoin ETF gets approved one spot, Bitcoin ETF, I suspect the whole lot will be there competing with each other. All right. And we got to ask you about this news that just came out this morning. The FTX bankruptcy. A state has apparently staked millions of E and Seoul. What kind of impact do you think this is going to have on the markets? I'm not sure it will have much of an impact price wise, but it's interesting that they've done this obviously because, I mean, you know, the actual amounts that have been staked aren't, aren't massively huge. I don't think they'll have that big an impact on prices, as I say. But, um, what's interesting about this is that I, I guess they're kind of um trapped with their crypto at this point and they have to stake it if they want to make any kind of yield. But, you know, for all those people out there who might be thinking of following suit. You know, far be it from me to discourage people from doing crypto and Bitcoin things. But let's not forget that money market funds are now offering about 5.5% yield in the United States. And those are, you know, not 100% safe, but as close to it as you could possibly get and you don't really get much more of a yield, I think less than 1% in addition to that uh for staking soul. So, so it kind of uh you know, the attractions of staking aren't quite what they were a couple of years ago. Put it that way, Glen, thanks so much for joining us this morning. Always a pleasure having you on. Good to be here and I'm glad I'm glad you do a lot of research before, before signing on. I was like, you know, you have tough, you know, your stuff. I got to be on my, on my a game as you New Jersey. People would say, we love a well researched guest. Glenn, thanks so much for being here this morning. See, you see, we should, we should note that gray scale and coin desk are both owned by DC G. That was the author of the crypto trader Glenn Goodman."

        "content": "Ferrari is one of the world\u2019s most exclusive brands, which means it can pick and choose which of the customers beating down its doors will get the keys to the next luxury sports car proudly bearing its signature prancing horse on the grill.\n\nSo news out of its Maranello headquarters that the Italian manufacturer now accepts cryptocurrencies as payment for its vehicles makes the announcement that much more unusual\u2014not even Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla offers that option.\n\n\u201cThis will help us connect to people who are not necessarily our clients but might afford a Ferrari,\u201d the company\u2019s sales chief, Enrico Galliera, told Reuters in an interview published on Saturday.\n\nIn order to avoid being hit by volatile swings in the price of Bitcoin\u2019s BTC and Ethereum\u2019s ETH\u2014two of the three currencies it will accept alongside Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin\u2014it will offload the risk to BitPay, a major provider of crypto payment services.\n\nThat way Ferrari avoids having to hold tokens on its own balance sheet, exposing its investors to crypto market risks like those emanating from last year\u2019s collapse of Terra/Luna, Celsius, 3AC, and most important FTX.\n\n\u201cThis was one of our main goals: avoiding, both [for] our dealers and us, to directly handle cryptocurrencies and being shielded from their wide fluctuations,\u201d Galliera told the news agency.\n\nGiven the anonymity provided by digital wallets\u2014which heightens their appeal for shadier elements in society\u2014BitPay will ensure that the payments are not illicitly gained money, laundered for the purposes of organized crime or tax evasion.\n\nGalliera said the decision, which resulted from requests by dealers and customers, would be limited to the U.S. market initially, but it plans to add Europe early next year.\n\nFamous for its mid-engine V12 supercars like the Enzo and LaFerrari, the company recently launched the first four-door model in the brand\u2019s 84-year history, the Purosangue crossover.\n\nThis departure from its strict devotion to coupes, once considered unthinkable, enables it to poach customers away from the Lamborghini Urus, Aston Martin DBX, and Bentley Bentayga.\n\nThe rapidly growing luxury crossover segment is popular in China, where demand for the kind of two-door luxury sports cars, in which Ferrari specializes, underperforms versus other regions, such as the U.S.\n\nFortune contacted Ferrari for further details on its crypto payment plans, but could not reach a representative.\n\nTesla abandoned its brief foray into crypto car sales\n\nTesla briefly attempted in early 2021 to accept payments for its cars in BTC, after buying $1.5 billion worth of the digital coin, but the effort lasted only a few weeks. CEO Elon Musk subsequently yanked the offer, citing three expos\u00e9s (including one from Fortune) revealing the voracious amount of energy the Bitcoin blockchain devours to power the compute-heavy consensus mechanism known as Proof of Work.\n\nMusk suffered several heavy impairment charges on the value of Tesla\u2019s BTC stake before liquidating the bulk of its remaining holdings last year. At the time he sought to placate his crypto-enthusiasts by claiming it wasn\u2019t a vote against the technology but owing to concerns he had about the \u201coverall liquidity of the company.\u201d\n\nSince then, Musk has allowed only a handful of select Tesla branded items in its merchandising store to be sold in Dogecoin, despite being well known for his support of the technology and numerous requests from his community to bring the option back.\n\nFerrari\u2019s Galliera did not reveal how many cars it expects to sell through crypto, but he said the company wanted to launch this experiment in a universe whose popularity exploded during the pandemic.\n\nEvery luxury brand needs to continuously rejuvenate its image to remain aspirational, and digitally native Zoomers often have vastly different attitudes toward brands and products than any other generation before them.\n\nThis is especially true among younger consumers disillusioned by traditional finance, known as \u201cTradFi.\u201d Instead they turned to decentralized finance, or \u201cDeFi\u201d, like cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based goods as a more appealing alternative.\n\n\u201cSome [customers] are young investors who have built their fortunes around cryptocurrencies,\u201d Galliera said."

        "content": "\u201cWe\u2019re contorting ourselves to pass through the keyhole of tyranny.\u201d Edward Snowden\u2019s words to the audience at the packed Genesis Stage hall at Bitcoin Amsterdam stressed the preeminent cryptocurrency\u2019s ever-increasing importance in a world beset by creeping government surveillance, devaluing fiat currencies and restrictive policies.\n\nThe renowned whistleblower\u2019s address summed up a recurring theme during the conference, driving home the role of decentralized protocols like Bitcoin and Nostr in giving individuals some control over their wealth and privacy.\n\nCointelegraph spoke to prominent Bitcoin developers, investors, builders and supporters attending the two-day conference at the picturesque Westerpark neighborhood in Amsterdam. Amid the ongoing cryptocurrency bear market, the event attracted a couple of thousand attendees searching for the latest news and insights in the Bitcoin (BTC) industry.\n\nSnowden delivers a live virtual address during the conference. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nWhile many prominent figures highlighted the value proposition of Bitcoin as a store of value against the diminishing purchasing power of fiat currencies, Snowden was critical of the continual focus on the value of BTC over its importance as a decentralized tool:\n\n\u201cWe are all part of a bigger game, and Bitcoin is one of the strongest levers in that. The systems that we are influencing, that we are exerting leverage on, [such as] payments and finance, will shape what the world of tomorrow looks like.\u201c\n\nSnowden\u2019s address arguably attracted the biggest gathering of visitors during the conference, as he revisited Bitcoin\u2019s role in his journey rebelling against the United States government and its wanton surveillance of citizens.\n\nIn 2013, Snowden used Bitcoin to pay for the servers that hosted classified information sent to journalists that would reveal the National Security Agency\u2019s overreach into the lives of American citizens. As Snowden elaborated, Bitcoin\u2019s growing prominence has led to increasing opposition from governments, lawmakers and legacy financial institutions.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to focus on things like ETFs [exchange-traded funds]; we need to focus on the fundamentals.\u201d\n\nSnowden added that the potential influence of Bitcoin ETFs on the value of the cryptocurrency represents \u201csubordination, a kind of subjugation, a process of taming\u201d that is being played out by institutions that regulate traditional financial spheres.\n\nSnowden also shared his belief that Bitcoin has \u201ca privacy problem,\u201d highlighting the emergence of obfuscation tools like CoinJoin and mixers as important but equally indicative of the pressure facing the decentralized protocol.\n\n\u201cActing in secret is not freedom. The necessity of CoinJoins and so on \u2014 that is because you are unfree. Proof of funds is proof of unfreedom.\u201d\n\nSnowden said that society needs to stop asking for permission by continuing to innovate with the creation of decentralized tools that do not heed the powers that be, referring to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s actions against the wider cryptocurrency space in 2023 as a prime example of the control that currently exists:\n\n\u201cAll of the people tracking price and looking at headlines involving the SEC, Gary Gensler is not daddy Bitcoin, I don\u2019t really care what he thinks, and I don\u2019t think you should either.\u201c\n\nThe whistleblower also tipped his hat to the creation of Nostr, which he described as powerful in conceptualizing the integration of free speech and free trade. The creators of Nostr would later unpack the genesis of the platform at the conference, which also drew a significant crowd.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Elegant and ass-backward\u2019: Jameson Lopp\u2019s first impression of Bitcoin"

        "content": "To function, Bitcoin uses blockchain technology. This is an information storage and transmission technology that connects buyers and sellers. All in complete security and transparency.\n\nWhile the aim of blockchain is to structure large volumes of information, it is no ordinary database. And for good reason: this technology takes the form of a set of interconnected blocks managed by electronic devices. Each block contains information which, once stored, cannot be modified. As soon as new information is received, the block is sealed by a computer code and added to another code. This forms a chain of blocks (hence blockchain).\n\nAll new transactions are grouped together in blocks. To add new data to the blocks, you need to mine Bitcoins. This means performing increasingly complex mathematical equations to verify the accuracy of the blocks.\n\nThese equations are necessary because Bitcoin\u2019s founders limited the amount of currency in circulation to 21 million units. However, at the start of 2023, there are already 18.3 million Bitcoins in circulation. The idea is to divide Bitcoins into small fractions (down to one hundred millionth) to ensure their availability. And all the while guaranteeing their accuracy."

        "content": "In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto founded the cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). Here\u2019s a look back at the pseudonymous creator and the price history of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat Happened: In October 2008, Nakamoto published a whitepaper titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\u201d It provided many key details and explained why Bitcoin was being created.\n\nIn January 2009, Nakamoto mined the genesis block of the first 50 Bitcoins.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was released, there were only two ways to get the cryptocurrency: You could either mine the Bitcoin yourself or use a peer-to-peer transaction.\n\nBitcointalk, a forum created by Nakamoto to host discussions on Bitcoin, was used for several transactions, which were deemed risky at the time because they required trust from both parties and were mostly anonymous.\n\nIn October 2009, one of the first-ever recognized Bitcoin transactions happened when a Finnish computer science student sold 5,050 Bitcoin for $5.02 (which represented a value of $0.0009 for each Bitcoin), according to Forbes. The transaction took place on PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL).\n\nLess than a year later, in May 2010, one of the most famous Bitcoin transactions of all-time \u2014 and what is widely believed to be the first retail transaction \u2014 took place when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz sought out a person to buy him pizza in exchange for Bitcoin. A person in England subsequently spent around $41 to buy Papa John\u2019s International Inc (NASDAQ: PZZA) pizza in exchange for 10,000 Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas, like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over the next day,\u201d Hanyecz said in the infamous online post.\n\nNow known as \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day,\u201d May 22 pays tribute to the day of that very famous Bitcoin transaction. At the time, Bitcoin had a value of around $0.0041.\n\nIt wasn't until 2011 and after the launch of several major crypto exchanges that the cryptocurrency hit a price of $1.\n\nIn 2021, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $68,789.63 as part of a year that saw increased interest in the leading cryptocurrency and many other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn 2022, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fell in value and interest with several notable cryptocurrency trading platforms declaring bankruptcy.\n\nGoing forward, there is optimism for Bitcoin with several major financial institutions having pending Bitcoin ETF filings that could be approved and create increased demand from institutions for the crypto with limited supply.\n\nRelated Link: How To Buy Bitcoin Investing $1,000 in Bitcoin: Using the early transactions referenced above, a hypothetical investment in Bitcoin in the early days could have provided quite the return for its holder, or in this case a \u201chodler.\u201d\n\nA $1,000 investment in Bitcoin at the time of the first transaction on PayPal would have netted 1,111,111.11 Bitcoin, even though that amount of cryptocurrency probably wouldn't have been available due to mining constraints. That $1,000 investment would be worth $31,247,366,635.40 today based on a price of $28,122.63 for Bitcoin at the time of writing.\n\nIn contrast, a $1,000 investment in Bitcoin at the time of the Bitcoin-pizza transaction would have netted 243,902.44 BTC. That investment would be worth $6,859,178,076.22 today based on the same price of $28,122.63 at the time of writing.\n\nWhile investing in Bitcoin today may never be worth billions of dollars in the future, the hypothetical investment illustrates the large increase in value of the leading cryptocurrency over time.\n\nMany have predicted Bitcon's death over the years, but the cryptocurrency remains the leader in the space and has a market capitalization of over $500 billion today.\n\nRead Next: 13 Fun Facts About Bitcoin\n\nMeet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga's exclusive event - Future of Digital Assets.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe US government has amassed around 200,000 Bitcoin from its three largest seizures alone.\n\nAgencies such as the DEA and FBI have often seized cryptocurrencies as part of their law enforcement actions.\n\nIt can often take years for the government to offload its crypto assets.\n\nIn some cases, the process is complicated by the ownership claims of other involved parties.\n\nAll the way back in 2013, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) seized 11.02 BTC from a South Carolina man attempting to buy illegal substances online. The seizure was the first of its kind and marked the beginning of a multi-billion dollar asset appropriation program spanning the DEA, FBI, and other US law enforcement agencies.\n\nBut, 10 years later, according to an analysis by 21.co, the US government now holds around 200,000 Bitcoin worth more than $5B, making it one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world.\n\nThe US Government\u2019s Biggest Bitcoin Hauls\n\nWhen the DEA reported its first Bitcoin bust, the crypto in question was worth just $814. But in the years since, US agencies have moved on to much larger fish.\n\nDollar value of US government\u2019s 3 largest Bitcoin seizures.\n\nAs reported by 21.co, the government\u2019s single largest haul was 94,643 BTC seized from wallets controlled by Heather Morgan and her husband Ilya Lichtenstein. Earlier this year, Morgan and Lichtenstein pleaded guilty to orchestrating a scheme to launder proceeds from the 2016 hack of the Bitfinex crypto exchange.\n\nBoth the second- and third-largest stashes of Bitcoin obtained by the government stem from the Silk Road darknet market.\n\nThe most valuable Silk Road seizure was undertaken by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2020. After the government successfully traced assets that had been stolen from the platform prior to it being shut down, the IRS commandeered 69,369 BTC from an unidentified Silk Road hacker\n\nA year later, law enforcement seized an additional 51,326 BTC from James Zhong, who siphoned the funds from the marketplace between 2012 and 2014.\n\nAlthough the three largest government bitcoin busts account for around 200,000 BTC between them, the real value of the government\u2019s bitcoin holdings could be even higher as that figure is only a lower-bound estimation based on publicly available information.\n\nBitcoin Ownership Contested as Government Stash Grows\n\nFor the roughly $5B worth of BTC associated with the three largest seizures, it is unlikely that there will be any legal challenges to the government\u2019s ownership of the Silk Road Assets.\n\nEven the imprisoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht has already forfeited any claim to the seized Bitcoin as part of a deal that saw the government use some of the assets to pay off Ulbricht\u2019s $183 million court debt.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the Bitfinex funds, the exchange itself has a legitimate claim to the seized Bitcoin.\n\nIn a statement , Bitfinex said it will work with the DoJ to \u201cestablish our rights to a return of the stolen Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, although Bitfinex insists that it has settled its debts with users who lost funds to the hack, many of the exchange\u2019s customers contest that they should be entitled to some of the seized Bitcoin, setting up a potential legal clash.\n\nGovernment BTC Sales Follow Procedure, Not Market Rates\n\nDue to the drawn-out legal process required to liquidate its holdings, and the need to consider legitimate legal claims like Bitfinex\u2019s (and its customers\u2019), it can take years for the government to convert its Bitcoin into dollars.\n\nThe WSJ just sprotofied the American flag.

But those gains quickly vanished after a spokesperson for BlackRock told Bloomberg that its spot bitcoin ETF application was still under review by the SEC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoinTelegraph followed up with a tweet, saying: \"We apologize for a tweet that led to the dissemination of inaccurate information regarding the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF. An internal investigation is currently underway.\"\n\nBitcoin pared its gains and is now up about 3%, hovering slightly above the $28,000 level.\n\nThe volatility spike in bitcoin on Monday highlights the hope investors have been holding onto for the SEC to approve a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhile the agency has approved bitcoin futures ETFs, it has repeatedly denied and delayed bitcoin spot ETF applications over the past few years, but hope has been renewed after massive asset management firms like BlackRock and Fidelity threw their hat into the ring with their own bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHope for a bitcoin spot ETF also surged after Grayscale Investments won a court appeal, which said that the SEC's decision to reject an application from Grayscale to convert its bitcoin trust fund into a spot bitcoin ETF was wrong.\n\nA recent Reuters report said that the SEC would not appeal that decision, lending some hope to investors that a spot bitcoin ETF could be imminent, including Ark Invest's Cathie Wood.\n\n\"I do think the SEC is moving now... some of the research that we believe is percolating up to [regulatory] commissioners might be getting through to them and might be the grounds now for the approval of a bitcoin ETF. And we don't think that the SEC will approve just one. They will probably approve a group of them,\" Wood said in a recent interview.\n\nThere are currently more than 10 spot bitcoin ETF applications under review by the SEC."

        "title": "Grayscale bitcoin discount narrows as ETF switch seen 'inevitable' - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "The world\u2019s largest bitcoin fund is surging faster than the cryptocurrency itself as investors anticipate that an exchange-traded fund centered on the token could soon launch.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is trading about 14% below the value of its underlying holdings intraday, the narrowest such reading going back to 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. The discount stood near 50% earlier this year.\n\nThe shares of the trust have rallied much more than the digital asset itself this year, with GBTC gaining 164% and bitcoin adding about 71%. On Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission declined to appeal an earlier positive court ruling for Grayscale.\n\nThe discount has narrowed significantly in recent weeks, as many analysts who closely follow the going-ons of the trust are anticipating that it will soon convert into an exchange-traded fund, something Grayscale has been saying for years it would like to accomplish. The odds of that happening moved in Grayscale\u2019s favor after the crypto asset manager in August scored a legal victory in federal court in its conversion bid.\n\n\u201cApproval of a spot bitcoin ETF looks inevitable at this point, given the court\u2019s Aug. 29 ruling, the number of recent spot bitcoin ETF applications and the SEC\u2019s engagement with them,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Elliott Stein and James Seyffart wrote in a note. \u201cBillions in unlocked value\u201d are at stake, they added.\n\nExcitement around potential ETF approval was evident Monday when a rumor sparked a roughly 10% rally for bitcoin after unverified sources said BlackRock had received the green-light from the SEC. Bitcoin reversed most of those gains after BlackRock debunked the speculation. However, the episode served as a reminder of the enthusiasm among crypto investors for such a product.\n\nStein and Seyffart argue that chances of Grayscale achieving the conversion heightened after the SEC opted against appealing the August ruling. The regulator could still appeal to the Supreme Court, though most see that as unlikely to happen.\n\nThe crypto industry has remained decimated since the downfall of the FTX exchange and a number of other companies last year, all of which has kept token prices depressed. Bitcoin, trading at around $28,000 Monday, is down from a record high of near $69,000 in late 2021. Bitcoin was up about 3.6% as of 10:42 a.m. in New York, while GBTC shares rose 7.9%.\n\nThe battle for a bitcoin ETF has been one bright spot for the industry, with many analysts forecasting that one could soon start trading in the U.S. after a decade-long battle by issuers to get one launched.\n\nIssuers have for years tried their hand at getting a spot bitcoin ETF off the ground in the U.S.. Officials have in the past cited market manipulation and other factors as reasons to not green-light applications, though they allowed ETFs based on bitcoin futures to start trading in 2021. But there are currently more than 10 filings for spot bitcoin ETFs, with industry heavyweights like BlackRock and Invesco among those in the race.\n\n\u201cThe increasing likelihood that the market will get its first U.S.-listed spot BTC ETF within the next few months\u201d is one factor currently supporting bitcoin, said Noelle Acheson, author of the \u201cCrypto Is Macro Now\u201d newsletter.\n\nThe next steps in Grayscale\u2019s fight for its GBTC-to-ETF conversion could involve an opening up of dialog between the crypto firm and the SEC, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Any clarity on this front is being seen as a positive as the process has remained opaque in terms of how many issuers might get approval \u2014 and under what circumstances \u2014 and whether multiple ETFs would be allowed to trade all at once, or if any one company might get a head start over its competitors.\n\nThough GBTC\u2019s discount to its holdings has narrowed significantly, it likely wouldn\u2019t go all the way to zero until the actual ETF conversion happens or is announced, according to BI. Still, any positive developments could help send the reading closer to zero, Seyffart said.\n\n\u201cThe news in the U.S. over Grayscale\u2019s ETF application has potentially very significant ramifications for the bitcoin market. The story of spot-price ETF approval has been a dominant narrative in the bitcoin market for several months now,\u201d said Simon Peters, market analyst at eToro. \u201cAs the barriers to approval fall, hopes among investors continue to rise that we could see these products in the market sooner rather than later.\u201d"

The $5 billion holdings consist of the three seizures mentioned.\n\nThe BTC is kept primarily offline in hardware wallets, which are encrypted storage devices, held by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service.

        "title": "Cathie Wood's Latest Bitcoin Insights: Is Now the Time to Buy? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Ark Invest, led by the visionary Chief Executive Officer Cathie Wood, has risen to prominence in recent years due to its innovation-centric investment strategies. Its priorities on assets with disruptive potential such as DNA sequencing, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology make the firm a natural fan and notable advocate of Bitcoin (BTC -2.89%) thanks to its status as the most decentralized, secure, and valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nTo shed more light on Bitcoin, Ark publishes a comprehensive report every month delving into blockchain-based metrics, investor behavior trends, and macroeconomic factors, providing valuable context on the crypto's status and potential trajectory. In the firm's most recent report, for the month of September, several crucial insights and trends were highlighted, suggesting the path Bitcoin might take in the coming months.\n\nLong-term holders: A steadfast base\n\nOne of the key indicators emphasized in Ark's report is the remarkable rise in the percentage of long-term holders. Now at an all-time high, 76% of Bitcoin's total available supply hasn't moved in more than 155 days, the point at which short-term holders change to long term.\n\nThis time frame might seem arbitrary, but analytics firm Glassnode has found it to be a statistically significant benchmark as those who hold past 155 days are more likely to be smart-money investors and can provide insight into market sentiment.\n\nArk's analysts point out that this trend of an increasing number of long-term holders aligns with other transitional periods in Bitcoin's history, suggesting that this bear market might not be fundamentally different from previous ones.\n\nTypically, long-term holders enter the market in droves and pick up coins on the cheap, creating an accumulation phase usually associated with post-bear markets and early stages of bull markets. Moreover, the increase in long-term holders further reduces the digital currency's already scarce supply, potentially setting the stage for a significant price surge should a bull market return.\n\nMetrics suggest oversold conditions\n\nArk's embrace of innovation and admiration for Bitcoin extends beyond just an anecdotal report. The firm also creates unique metrics and indicators to assess its current position relative to past cycles. The latest report highlighted two specific statistics supporting Ark's stance that the cryptocurrency is currently trading at a relative discount.\n\nThe profit/loss ratio, comparing the number of coins transacted at a profit to those at a loss, currently hovers just above 1, indicating a decline in investor \"exuberance\" compared to earlier in the year, when Bitcoin's price jumped more than 80% in just five months. When reaching these levels in the past, the crypto was either in the depths of a bear market or clawing its way back into a bull market. Ark sees it as the latter.\n\nArk highlighted another crucial metric, the realized-profits-to-realized-cap ratio, which is currently at its lowest point since the beginning of the year, further indicating oversold conditions. This ratio measures profit-taking among Bitcoin investors against its realized cap, rather than the more commonly used market cap. Since realized cap is calculated by multiplying the last price at which every Bitcoin was transacted instead of valuing every coin at its current price, it offers a more sensitive and less misleading assessment than market cap.\n\nBy quantifying the amount of realized profits against Bitcoin's realized cap, Ark is able to measure buying and selling activity more clearly. Considering Bitcoin has historically entered the oversold territory of this ratio only seven times in its history, today could be an opportune moment for investors.\n\nThe macroeconomic landscape: Challenges and optimism\n\nArk's report doesn't shy away from acknowledging current unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and the potential challenges they pose to Bitcoin's bull market return. The prolonged interest rate hikes and tighter liquidity anticipated in markets globally could present hurdles for cryptocurrencies since typically these assets have thrived in environments with liquidity surpluses.\n\nHowever, despite short-term challenges, Ark remains bullish on Bitcoin in the long run. Its analysis suggests that the cryptocurrency's resiliency and favorable developments of on-chain metrics such as the number of active owners and mining difficulty, put it in a potentially lucrative position as it navigates the fine line between bear and bull markets."

        "title": "This 1 Magic Number Will Tell You if a Bitcoin Mining Stock Is Worth Buying - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Throughout 2023, Bitcoin (BTC -2.89%) mining stocks have been soaring. For example, Riot Platforms (RIOT -7.33%) is up 180% for the year, while Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA -9.89%) is up an almost equally impressive 134%. The price of Bitcoin is up 60% during this period, so this strong market performance makes sense.\n\nBut there's more to analyzing Bitcoin mining stocks beyond just the price of Bitcoin. One magic number could be very helpful for investors in determining which mining stocks are worth buying.\n\nBitcoin production capacity\n\nIt might sound obvious, but Bitcoin miners make money by mining as much Bitcoin as they can. As long as the price of Bitcoin is increasing, this should be profitable. That's why 2023 has been such a banner year for Bitcoin mining stocks.\n\nThe focus in 2023 has been on overall Bitcoin production capacity. There are several ways to analyze production capacity. The easiest way is simply to look at how much Bitcoin has been mined each month. The largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners provide monthly production updates, and it's easy to see at a glance how much they've produced over any 30-day period.\n\nYou could also take a more nuanced view, and look at factors like the number of mining rigs in operation, as well as the number of mining rigs that are set to come on stream soon. Or you could look at a factor like hash rate, which measures the amount of computational power being used to mine Bitcoin.\n\nThe overall takeaway is clear: Bigger is better in 2023. Investing in Bitcoin mining stocks is relatively easy this year -- just find the company mining the most Bitcoin, and you're good to go.\n\nBitcoin operational efficiency\n\nHowever, this narrative around Bitcoin mining stocks could change in 2024 due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April. This event, which takes place only once every four years, is one of the most anticipated events in the crypto industry. With any halving event, the reward paid out to Bitcoin miners for mining a single block of Bitcoin drops by 50%.\n\nThis might sound like a highly technical event of interest only to blockchain enthusiasts, but it has massive repercussions for Bitcoin miners. Essentially, it means that, all things being equal, Bitcoin miners will earn half as much money doing the same amount of work. To put this into perspective: Imagine if your boss told you that your salary has been slashed by 50%, but that you're still expected to show up and do the same amount of work.\n\nThat's why we're starting to see warning signals from analysts. One term I've seen used is \"severe income stress,\" and I think that perfectly explains what's about to happen in 2024. According to analysts, production costs are going to double in 2024 due to the halving. Currently, the breakeven production cost for a single Bitcoin is approximately $15,000. As long as the price of Bitcoin stays above $15,000, Bitcoin miners should be profitable. However, in 2024, the average production cost for mining a single Bitcoin could increase to $30,000.\n\nIf you check out the current price of Bitcoin -- roughly $27,000 as of mid-October -- you can see why an average production cost of $30,000 is so worrisome. The average Bitcoin miner is not going to be making money next year unless the price of Bitcoin increases.\n\nThe magic number for Bitcoin miners\n\nThus, my magic number for evaluating Bitcoin miners is the average cost to produce a single Bitcoin. As an investor, I want this number to be as low as possible. I want to invest in a Bitcoin mining operation that is streamlined, efficient, and fully prepared to deal with \"severe income stress\" next year.\n\nThe one Bitcoin company I'm focused on right now is Riot Platforms, which is generally acknowledged to have the lowest Bitcoin production costs in the industry. In the second quarter of 2023, the average cost to produce a single Bitcoin was only $8,389. And that was actually a decline from the year-earlier period, when the average cost was $11,316. This tells me two things: Riot Platforms has a very efficient operation, and its operations are getting more efficient over time.\n\nGoing forward, the average Bitcoin production cost is what I'm using to evaluate Bitcoin miners. Yes, the absolute amount of Bitcoin they are producing is still important, but I want to make sure that these companies are making money on every coin they mine. Long story short, only the most cost-effective Bitcoin miners with the lowest production costs are going to survive in 2024. That's why I'm bullish on Bitcoin mining stocks that are best-in-class when it comes to operational efficiency."

        "content": "00:00\n\nJoining us now is James Safer, a Bloomberg Intelligence and Kailey Leinz, co-host of Bloomberg Crypto. The programme. That programme airs tomorrow on PM. By the way, every Tuesday at 1 p.m.. James, let's start off with you. How did this all happen? Did it roll from kind of the greyscale people familiar story into this? Yeah, I mean, it all happened literally from a tweet and it ripped it rip through everything. A bunch of sources started citing that it was approved. And then you saw a whole bunch of like prominent crypto and financial people tweeting that it was approved 15 minutes after the initial tweet went out. And even right around, Eric and I both sent out separate tweets saying that we thought this was fake news. And I basically spent ten plus minutes scouring S.E.C. websites, everything I could find that would cram plus minutes. Don't tell yourself now, James. Yeah, well, I was watching the Bitcoin price rip up to $30,000 and I was like, I'm pretty sure this is fake, but I was like, I'm not going to tweet this is fake and say this is fake publicly unless I could have some sort of confirmation because there was a lot of news. Right. The FCC the FCC had a deadline on Friday to file for an en banc and virtually an appeal in the great skip. I'm so we're going to get more information this week. So it wouldn't have been completely insane, but it was very unlikely in my view. Okay. So you spent 10 minutes looking through the SEC filings, Kelly. You actually also look through the SEC filings. When do you think we're actually going to get the news? Well, that is the million dollar question, Alex. Of course, the SEC has deferred making decisions on a multitude of these filings recently. So we'll see. They're facing some deadlines coming up. I believe our deadline is in January. And yet it does seem like the pressure may be building given this deadline. They just Speights and grayscale that James was talking about. They decided not to appeal that ruling, which of course found that they were arbitrary and capricious in denying Grayscale's attempt to convert GBTC into an ETF. So it feels like it might be kind of crunch time. But of course we know that Gary Gensler, the SEC more broadly, has raised a lot of concern about market manipulation and fraud in the crypto markets. That really has been their reasoning why they haven't approved spot Bitcoin products in the past. We'll see if it changes going forward in the future and frankly, what it may make a material difference at all to this market given we have seen some whipsaw in Bitcoin. We certainly saw it this morning off of this news. So clearly there is still some anticipation and excitement there. But also given what we've seen with interest Ether future ETF, which really hasn't brought with it much flow or excitement, it remains to be seen what actually approval might mean for the crypto market. Yeah, absolutely. I was going to say, Kelly, it really is just a $1 million question, maybe $2 million. James, what do we know about, you know, judging from the price action as this fake news rips through the market, can you tell us anything about what you expect for when we do get an approved ETF flows and PRICE Yes. So Erik and I are very much on record that we think it's going to happen by that January deadline that that Kelly mentioned. But also we don't know what the next steps are for grayscale. So we could see something happen before that. If the SEC is forced to issue some sort of either deny for different reasons or approve before that January deadline. So we're we're very much like kind of waiting to see what happens. This was kind of like a dry run for like what's going to happen if these things actually do get approved. I mean, that was a rip. I mean, Eric said rip on live TV like that. It really was kind of a very aggressive. So a lot of people obviously weren't expecting it. Maybe more people will be ready for it in case it does happen the way we expect it to. But it basically gave traders a playbook of like what's going to happen if this approval does happen. Just signals that maybe the market isn't really ready for it. The other thing is we expect a bunch of these to go at the same time, the way the ether futures went, right, that a whole bunch of ether futures ETFs went live on the same day. We think the same thing is going to happen with these spot Bitcoin ETFs. So what happens as far as flows? But we think it'll be significant. It's going to be a meaningful launch and there's likely to be a lot of money at play here."

        "title": "SBF and Caroline Ellison conspired to keep Bitcoin under $20K, but did it work? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "On Oct. 11, Caroline Ellison, former head of the now-defunct Alameda Research, informed a United States court that she received instructions from FTX co-founder and CEO Sam \u201cSBF\u201d Bankman-Fried to sell Bitcoin (BTC) if its price remained above $20,000.\n\nThis admission came as a shock to the entire crypto industry, but the two conspiring to suppress BTC\u2019s price, versus actually doing it, are two different things.\n\nWhile there are no details available regarding the size and timing of these trades, the timeframe likely falls between September and October 2022, just weeks before Alameda and FTX collapsed.\n\nDetermining whether Alameda effectively acted to suppress Bitcoin\u2019s price below $20,000, as alleged by some analysts and traders, is challenging, if not impossible. Nevertheless, it is possible to assess the significance of FTX\u2019s Bitcoin holdings in comparison to other exchanges and the total trading volume.\n\nLook at the Bitcoin wallets\n\nCurrently, the only reliable publicly available information pertains to the BTC wallets that previously constituted the exchange\u2019s reserves, amounting to less than 47,000 BTC by September 2022, according to Glassnode data. It\u2019s possible that Alameda Research held other addresses directly, but given the substantial debt of the trading company, it\u2019s unlikely they had any liquid reserves.\n\nOne should not assume that FTX used its entire stack of Bitcoin from users since the exchange continued processing client withdrawals until its final day on Nov. 8, 2022. Moving these assets abruptly would have aroused suspicion, potentially accelerating their insolvency. Nevertheless, it\u2019s worthwhile to investigate the significance of FTX volumes and holdings.\n\nCoinbase vs. FTX monthly spot Bitcoin volume, USD. Source: CoinMetrics\n\nAs of July 2022, FTX reported a spot Bitcoin volume of $30 billion, equivalent to $1 billion per day on average. However, relying on these numbers is not advisable, given the exchange\u2019s history of data manipulation, as demonstrated by their falsified insurance fund calculation methodology.\n\nAssuming the sales mentioned by Ellison occurred on FTX, a 4,000-BTC order, valued at $80 million at the time, would represent only 8% of the exchange\u2019s average daily volume. Furthermore, when considering the total Bitcoin volume from major exchanges, Alameda\u2019s speculated order size becomes even more inconsequential.\n\nAccording to Messari\u2019s \u201creal volume\u201d methodology, which excludes wash trading, the aggregate Bitcoin volume was below $3.5 billion per day between September and October 2022. Even if Alameda attempted to sell 25% of their 47,000 BTC holdings in a single day, that $240 million would represent only 7% of the daily volume across major exchanges.\n\nFor comparison, in April 2022, MicroStrategy announced the acquisition of 4,167 BTC at an average price of $45,714, totaling $190 million. This likely occurred in late March, with Bitcoin\u2019s price increasing by 6%, from $44,580 to $47,270.\n\nBitcoin price index (USD), March\u2013April 2022. Source: TradingView\n\nTwo notable aspects of the price action during MicroStrategy\u2019s acquisition stand out. First, the price dropped below $46,000 on the same day as the official announcement on April 5, 2022. More importantly, the $48,000 peak appears to correspond to the levels where MicroStrategy completed its execution, resulting in the $45,714 average price.\n\nHowever, when examining the broader picture, Bitcoin was trading around $39,500 in the two weeks leading up to MicroStrategy\u2019s activity and decreased to $39,500 a few weeks later. There is no reason to believe that a single entity could effectively suppress the price for longer than a week, whether it\u2019s Tesla unloading $936 million worth of Bitcoin or Alameda liquidating FTX clients\u2019 deposits.\n\nTo provide some context, Binance held 623,000 BTC in reserves in August 2022, while Coinbase had nearly 690,000 BTC. These two exchanges combined held almost 28 times more Bitcoin than FTX. This fact underscores the limited impact of SBF and Caroline\u2019s venture in terms of effective firepower.\n\nIn essence, there may have been a few days where Alameda exerted pressure successfully, causing their sales to suppress Bitcoin\u2019s price below $20,000. However, considering their reserves and the price action of similarly sized orders, the event was unlikely to be significant when analyzing a period longer than a month.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "The S&P 500 Index nudged higher by 0.45% to record its second positive week. While the United States equities markets were a slow mover, gold witnessed a massive run-up of more than 5% this week. Its rally of 3.11% on Oct. 13 was its best one-day performance since Dec. 1 of last year. However, the Bitcoin (BTC) bulls did not have any such luck as Bitcoin is on track to end the week down more than 3%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s weakness and the regulatory overhang have kept crypto investors away from altcoins. That has kept Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance hovering near the 50% mark for the past few days.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nMarket observers are likely to keep their focus on Bitcoin for the next few days. The longer the bulls sustain the price above $25,000, the greater the possibility that the next move is likely to be higher. A bullish move in Bitcoin is likely to spur buying in select altcoins as crypto investors will then sense a bull market.\n\nSelect cryptocurrencies are showing signs of forming a base. If they breakout to the upside, a new up-move may start. Let\u2019s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that could outperform in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been trading between the moving averages for the past few days, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nUsually, a tight consolidation is followed by a range expansion. In this case, if buyers kick the price above the 20-day exponential moving average ($27,110), the BTC/USDT pair could rise to $28,143. The bears are expected to mount a strong defense at this level.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down and dives below the 50-day simple moving average ($26,671), it will signal that bears have asserted their supremacy. The pair may first drop to $25,990 and thereafter to the pivotal support at $24,800. This level is likely to attract aggressive buying by the bulls.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair\u2019s recovery is facing selling at the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart but a positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that the buyers are not rushing to the exit and are keeping up the pressure.\n\nIf the 20-EMA is taken out, the pair could first rise to the 50-SMA. This level may act as a minor barrier but if overcome, the pair could climb to $27,750 and then to $28,143.\n\nOn the contrary, if the bulls fail to pierce the 20-EMA, the sellers will sense an opportunity to pull the price lower. A dump below $26,500 could sink the pair to $26,000 and then to $24,800.\n\nSolana price analysis\n\nSolana (SOL) has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the 20-day EMA ($21.77). This suggests that the bulls are trying to flip this level into support.\n\nSOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThere is a minor resistance at $22.50 but if this level is crossed, the SOL/USDT pair could rise to the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern. A break and close above this resistance will complete the bullish setup. Buyers may face a stiff resistance at $27.12 but if this hurdle is cleared, the pair could surge to the target objective at $32.81.\n\nThis positive view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the 50-day SMA ($20.50). That could start a descent toward $18.58 and then to $15.33.\n\nAfter trading between the moving averages for some time, the price resolved to the downside with a break below the 20-EMA. This indicates that the bears may remain in control. The pair could first fall to $20.93 and if this level also cracks, the pair may collapse to $20.\n\nConversely, if the price fails to sustain below the 20-EMA, it will suggest solid buying at lower levels. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 50-SMA. That could open the doors for a rally to $23.50 and then to the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern.\n\nLido DAO price analysis\n\nLido DAO (LDO) has been trading near the moving averages for the past few days, indicating that the bears may be losing their grip.\n\nLDO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have flattened out and the RSI has jumped into the positive territory, indicating that the bulls are attempting a comeback. The immediate resistance on the upside is $1.73. If this level is scaled, the LDO/USDT pair could climb to the downtrend line. This level is again likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down and skids below the moving averages, it will suggest that the bears are in command and are selling on every minor rally. The pair may then retest the vital support at $1.38.\n\nThe 20-EMA has started to turn up on the 4-hour chart and the RSI is in the positive area, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. There is a minor resistance at $1.63 but it is likely to be crossed. The pair could then rise to $1.73.\n\nIf bears want to weaken the bullish momentum, they will have to quickly drag the price back below the moving averages. The pair could then slump to the $1.45 to $1.50 support zone.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin traders eye weekly close volatility with $27K BTC price on radar\n\nInternet Computer price analysis\n\nInternet Computer (ICP) has been consolidating in a tight range between $2.86 and $3.35 for the past several days.\n\nICP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe RSI has formed a positive divergence, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. The ICP/USDT pair could next reach the overhead resistance at $3.35. A break and close above this level will signal a potential trend change. The first target on the upside is $4 and then $4.50.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $3.35, it will suggest that the pair may extend its stay inside the range for some more time. A slide below $2.86 will indicate the resumption of the downtrend.\n\nICP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the overbought zone on the 4-hour chart. This indicates that the buyers have the upper hand. The pair is likely to reach the overhead resistance at $3.35 where the bears may to pose a strong challenge.\n\nIf the price turns down from $3.35, the consolidation may continue for a while longer. On the other hand, if buyers kick the price above $3.35, it will indicate that the bulls are in charge. The pair may then soar to $3.74 and later to the pattern target of $3.84.\n\nVeChain price analysis\n\nVeChain (VET) has been trading inside a descending triangle for the past few days. Although this is a negative pattern, the price has been clinging to the downtrend line for the past few days, which is a positive sign.\n\nVET/USDT daily chart.

Buyers will try to propel the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, it will invalidate the negative setup. That could start a new up-move toward $0.021.\n\nInstead, if the price turns down from the current level, it will suggest that bears continue to defend the downtrend line with vigor. The bears will then again try to pull the price to the critical support at $0.014.\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the price has been trading inside the falling wedge pattern. Buyers are trying to push and sustain the price above the 50-SMA. If they do that, the VET/USDT pair could reach the downtrend line of the wedge. A break and close above the wedge could start a new up-move.\n\nThe bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will aggressively defend the zone between the 50-SMA and the downtrend line. If the price turns down sharply and slides below the 20-EMA, it will indicate that the pair may remain inside the wedge for some more time.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency stocks surged after a sudden rise in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices. The rising cryptocurrency values sent Grayscale Bitcoin (NASDAQ:GBTC) blasting up over 6% in Monday afternoon\u2019s trading, and it was hardly alone. Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) was up fractionally, and Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) added significantly. Meanwhile, both Invesco (NYSE:IVZ) and WisdomTree (NYSE:WT) gained over 2% in Monday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nThe biggest reason for the gains was that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), having fought tooth and nail against a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for years now, is pretty much out of ammunition in this fight and will ultimately have to approve its existence. That alone was enough to offer hope to the diamond-handed HODLer everywhere, but some analysts caution that the rise will not be linear. There will still be \u201cspeed bumps\u201d along the way, some note.\n\nMeanwhile, it doesn\u2019t hurt matters that Bitcoin is being increasingly regarded as a \u201csafe haven\u201d trade. Some analysts here point to Bitcoin\u2019s built-in scarcity mechanisms, as well as the inherent difficulty of trying to manipulate pricing on Bitcoin the way it can be done for silver and gold trading. Market manipulation of precious metals has long been a concern of gold bugs, and Bitcoin simply doesn\u2019t have that issue. One even believed that built-in scarcity plus the resistance to manipulation would make Bitcoin more likely to outpace gold in the next 10 years.\n\nWhich Cryptocurrency Stock is a Good Investment?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, MSTR stock is currently the leader in terms of Wall Street expectations. This Moderate Buy-rated stock has a price target of $433.25, which means an upside potential of 34.25%. Meanwhile, COIN stock offers the least upside, as it offers 15.38% upside potential thanks to its average price target of $85.50.\n\nDisclosure"

Factors like market speculation, investor sentiment, liquidity constraints, and even regulatory news can influence this price divergence.\u201d\n\nMelker continued that the door opening to GBTC becoming an ETF was \u201cstill far from a sure thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cConcurrently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is also scrutinizing several other spot Bitcoin ETF proposals, including those from financial giants like Fidelity, Blackrock, and Franklin Templeton, which adds another layer of complexity and uncertainty to the landscape,\u201d he noted.\n\nGBTC premium vs. asset holdings vs. BTC/USD chart (screenshot). Source: CoinGlass\n\nMining difficulty set for imminent new record\n\nThe latest BTC price increase has helped boost prognoses for Bitcoin network fundamentals.\n\nAhead of its next automated readjustment on Oct. 16, Bitcoin difficulty is currently forecast to expand to new all-time highs, per data from monitoring resource BTC.com.\n\nBitcoin network fundamentals overview (screenshot). Source: BTC.com\n\nThis is nothing new in 2023, the year in which both difficulty and mining hash rate have frequently achieved new records. The upcoming difficulty hike, however, could make it into the top three year-to-date at nearly 7%.\n\nShould it lock in, difficulty will cross the 60 trillion mark for the first time, reflecting the increasingly stiff competition among miners and unparalleled Bitcoin network security.\n\nHash rate estimates, meanwhile, vary significantly by resource. Raw hash rate data from MiningPoolStats shows the latest all-time high of 497.66 exahashes per second (EH/s) hitting on Oct. 9.\n\nBitcoin raw hash rate data (screenshot). Source: MiningPoolStats\n\nThe high difficulty combined with comparatively modest BTC price levels inevitably opens questions over miner profitability. With expenses running ever higher per Bitcoin, concerns periodically appear over how incentivized miners are to continue.\n\nJust as with hash rate, estimates vary over how expensive the per-bitcoin aggregate production cost really is, with a multitude of factors, including physical location, all playing a part in the tally.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, next year\u2019s block subsidy halving will additionally cut the amount of BTC received per mined block by 50%.\n\n\u201cI think price is okay for miners atm, but come halving and increasing difficulty needs to increase rapidly,\u201d James Straten, research and data analyst at crypto insights firm CryptoSlate, wrote in part of X commentary last week.\n\nA precarious \u201cUptober\u201d\n\nDoes the fate of \u201cUptober\u201d 2023 hang in the balance?\n\nRelated: Bitcoin signals potential range expansion\u2014 Will SOL, LDO, ICP and VET follow?\n\nEven modest changes in BTC spot price can influence the month-to-date gains for October thanks to the strength of the current trading range, which has been in place since March.\n\n#Bitcoin We did not get Uptober or Rektober but instead we got Choptober.\n\n\n\nThis would be the first time after 4 years where Oktober would end up red.\n\n\n\nLast month was the first green September after 6 years.\n\n\n\nWe're only halfway through the month though so a lot can change. pic.twitter.com/NsoVvH5O7D \u2014 Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) October 14, 2023\n\nWhile negative just last week, the push to $28,000 now means that BTC/USD is up 3.5% since the beginning of the month.\n\nWith two weeks until the monthly close, Bitcoin\u2019s ultimate performance remains anyone\u2019s guess. 3.5%, while far from poor, would still constitute Bitcoin\u2019s weakest October month since 2018.\n\nData from CoinGlass further shows the worst October on record in 2014 produced \u201conly\u201d 12% losses for Bitcoin, leaving the door open for a new red record should conditions deteriorate.\n\nBTC/USD monthly returns (screenshot).

        "title": "Why Riot Platforms, Hut 8 Mining, and TeraWulf Popped on Monday - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nThe crypto industry had a bit of a jolt this morning when it was reported that Blackrock's Bitcoin (BTC -2.42%) ETF had gotten regulatory approval. However, those early reports were false, and Blackrock confirmed the exchange-traded fund (ETF) had not been approved.\n\nBitcoin miners were among the biggest movers on the market early in trading and have held onto some of their gains. Shares of Riot Platforms (RIOT -7.77%) jumped as much as 14.4% this morning, Hut 8 Mining (HUT) was up 15.1%, and TeraWulf (WULF -6.90%) gained 16.7%. The stocks were up 3.2%, 9.3%, and 9.8% as of 2:30 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nSo what\n\nBitcoin hit nearly $30,000 after Cointelegraph reported that the ETF had been approved. The value quickly dropped after multiple sources confirmed with Blackrock that the ETF had not been approved.\n\nDespite the false report, Bitcoin is still up 5.3% in the last 24 hours, so there are some gains that are driving Bitcoin mining stocks.\n\nMiners are especially leveraged to the price of Bitcoin because they generate revenue from Bitcoin when it's mined and have also been holding it on their balance sheets. This makes them extremely highly leveraged to price movements.\n\nThere was positive news on the regulatory front when California Governor Newsom signed the Digital Financial Assets Law, which will create a regulatory framework for crypto in the state.\n\nThe other good news is that Bitcoin ETFs do appear to be on the horizon, and that could open more investors up to the crypto industry. If it causes a flood of investment to come into Bitcoin, the bounce in today's valuations may be justified.\n\nNow what\n\nBitcoin ETFs seem to have been \"coming soon\" for a very long time now, and we still don't have them, at least for the spot price of Bitcoin. When Blackrock announced its application for a Bitcoin ETF, it was thought that this could be a pivotal moment because of how big and connected the company is. But we're still in a waiting game.\n\nSpeculation will continue, but for now, we're still in regulatory limbo. As a result, I don't think it's ultimately worth speculating on Bitcoin through miners because they are such a leveraged way to invest in the industry. If Bitcoin dropped, some of them would be in serious financial trouble.\n\nI also question how much value Bitcoin will have in a world where the blockchain is starting to gain adoption in the financial industry. But Bitcoin isn't what's being transacted; it's stablecoins like the USDC token on low-cost, fast blockchains. The Bitcoin blockchain isn't stable, it's not fast, and it's not low-cost, so it may have an uphill battle when it comes to everyday adoption.\n\nBitcoin's best use may simply be \"digital gold,\" and maybe that's enough to drive value for an ETF. But it's not the kind of productive asset I want to invest in, which is why I'm staying away from Bitcoin and the miners today."

        "title": "Bitcoin ETF Saga: Fact vs. Fiction - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Fact: The US Securities and Exchange Commission Will Not Appeal the Grayscale (GBTC) ETF Ruling\n\nA Bitcoin Trust is a financial vehicle where investors pool their funds to buy and hold Bitcoin. Bitcoin Trusts operate like a traditional investment and are traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) stock exchange. Bitcoin Trusts indirectly own Bitcoin through the trust\u2019s holdings.\n\nConversely, a Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is a fund that tracks the price of Bitcoin and is traded on stock exchanges, just like a stock. ETF investors buy shares of the fund, which in turn owns Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs are more optimal because they directly own Bitcoin, and offer investors more liquidity and flexibility than Bitcoin Trusts.\n\nGrayscale runs the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin Trust. However, Grayscale has been working to clear the \u201cred tape\u201d of switching from a Bitcoin Trust to an ETF for the past two years. Because the SEC did not act before the Friday deadline, the SEC will not appeal an August court loss over Grayscale\u2019s ETF conversion application. In a statement to CoinDesk, a Grayscale spokeswoman said: \u201cThe Grayscale team remains operationally ready to convert GBTC to an ETF upon the SEC\u2019s approval, and we look forward to sharing more information as soon as practicable.\u201d\n\nFiction: The SEC Approved Blackrock\u2019s (BLK) Bitcoin ETF\n\nEarly Monday morning, CoinTelegraph, one of crypto\u2019s most followed news sites, tweeted news that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had approved Blackrock\u2019s Ishares spot Bitcoin ETF. As a result, Bitcoin spiked to two-month highs and neared the psychologically important $30,000 level before reversing. However, there was one major problem \u2013 the tweet was a hoax. A few hours after sending Bitcoin soaring, CoinTelegraph retracted its tweet and said it was investigating why false news was spread. Meanwhile, Blackrock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, confirmed that the headline was false and said the Bitcoin application is still under review by the SEC.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nFact: Blackrock\u2019s ETF Approval is a Matter of \u201cWhen\u201d, Not \u201cIf\u201d\n\nThe SEC is reeling from several crypto-related court losses in the US. While a Blackrock ETF is not a 100% lock, it\u2019s pretty close. History shows that Blackrock\u2019s ETF approval-to-loss ratio is more than 500-to-1. I like those odds.\n\nWinners\n\nClearly, the market wants a Bitcoin ETF. Conspicuously, even though the Blackrock news turned out to be false (or premature), Bitcoin rose strongly on heavy turnover Monday \u2013 a sign of significant demand. GBTC was the day\u2019s big winner and increased more than 8.5% - more than Bitcoin rose.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nShould ETFs start to be approved in the coming months, winners include Coinbase (COIN), MicroStrategy (MSTR), andRiot Platforms (RIOT). COIN will benefit because it is the custodian exchange for nearly every Bitcoin ETF. MSTR will benefit because of its massive Bitcoin holdings. RIOT, a Bitcoin miner, will benefit from further adoption.\n\nBottom Line\n\nA flurry of headlines sparked the price of Bitcoin on Monday. If a Bitcoin ETF is approved, it would be massively bullish.

        "content": "\u201cIf it\u2019s inflationary, you have more incentive to spend it. If it\u2019s deflationary you have more incentive to save it because in the future you may end up converting [your bitcoin] to fiat currencies when you need to spend.\u201d\n\nAnother crypto evangelist, Daniel Roberts, the co-founder of US-based and Nasdaq-listed bitcoin miner Iris Energy, said investors were kidding themselves if they believed cash was a safe or risk-free investment to hold.\n\nDaniel Roberts, co-founder and co-chief executive of Iris Energy. Michael Quelch\n\n\u201cFiat currencies are programmed to be debased,\u201d he told the summit.\n\n\u201cGovernments must keep printing now [due to fiscal imbalances and debt], if you\u2019ve got an 8 or 9 per cent return on your capital [as a sharemarket or property investor] all you\u2019ve done is preserve your wealth.\u201d\n\nMr Armstrong warned that emerging market currencies in Africa, the Asia Pacific and South America faced \u201clong tails\u201d of destruction due to reckless and corrupt governments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBitcoin has an important role in feeding the moral imperative to replace the long tail of fiat currencies that are really abused the most in [emerging market] countries around the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA lot of those currencies eroded the wealth of the poorest people in society. And it\u2019s a real tragic story where governments have abused that and it\u2019s basically like theft.\u201d\n\nSince its initial public offer at the peak of the cryptocurrency bubble in November 2021, Coinbase \u2013 as the largest crypto exchange in the US \u2013 has ridden a regulatory storm and crypto price rollercoaster, which saw it reach a valuation of more than $US100 billion at $US429.54 per share at the time of its float.\n\nThe stock has tumbled to $US73.43 per share since its float as the US Federal Reserve took interest rates on cash from 0.25 per cent in March 2022 to an upper bound of 5.5 per cent in July 2023.\n\nMr Armstrong said the revised policy settings in the US, among other strengths, meant he did not believe the US dollar was in danger of being displaced from its status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. However, bitcoin was acting as a \u201cballast against deficit spending\u201d by the US government.\n\nIn the US Mr Armstrong faces an ongoing legal battle after the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged Coinbase violated securities laws by operating as an unregistered broker and clearing agency for cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Bitcoin reversed an earlier gain of as much as 10% after BlackRock said that its application for an exchange-traded fund that invests directly in the cryptocurrency is still under review.\u201cThe iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF application is still under review by the SEC,\u201d a spokesperson said. Bitcoin was up about 3% to $28,000 as of 10:12am in New York on Monday after briefly jumping to $30,000.Speculation swirled on social media that BlackRock, which in June submitted an application for a spot-Bitcoin ETF, received a green-light from the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the first such product in the US. That spurred the surge in the largest coin, though Bitcoin quickly reversed the majority of those gains after the rumor was debunked.Still, the episode suggests that there remains a lot of excitement and hope for a spot-Bitcoin product in the US, which regulators have in the past refused to allow. They\u2019ve previously cited market manipulation, among other reasons, for not granting an endorsement. However, the incident also serves as a reminder that Bitcoin\u2019s price can easily be moved by gossip or hearsay.There are currently more than 10 filings for spot-Bitcoin ETFs, with industry heavyweights like BlackRock and Invesco being part of the race \u2014 which has some analysts guessing that the odds for approval may be greater this time around given their participation in the race.Another factor influencing analyst predictions on whether a spot-Bitcoin fund will soon be allowed to launch is Grayscale\u2019s win against the SEC as the crypto-asset-manager tries to convert its $16.7 billion Bitcoin Trust \u2014 known as GBTC \u2014 into an ETF. On Friday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission declined to appeal on earlier positive court ruling for Grayscale, which in the eyes of many analysts served as yet another positive step toward the approval process.\u201cThat was a good 30 minutes of fun and games,\u201d Teong Hng, CEO of crypto investment firm Satori Research, said of Monday\u2019s roundabout."

        "content": "Facility is already available in America and will be rolled out to Europe soon in response to customer demand\n\nCryptocurrencies have taken a bit of a hammering over the last couple of years, but many younger investors have built their wealth this way, and now Ferrari is letting them buy supercars using blockchain tech.\n\nFerrari dealers in the U.S. are already taking crypto payments and the service will be rolled out to Europe in early 2024, followed by other regions at a later date due to demand from wealthy clients, the brand\u2019s marketing boss told Reuters. Bitcoin and ether are both accepted by dealers, as is the stablecoin, USDC.\n\nCrypto doesn\u2019t exactly have a great reputation for stability, so Ferrari\u2019s chosen payment processor, BitPay, will immediately convert the digital currencies into traditional money to prevent dealers getting stung by price fluctuations. It\u2019s also BitPay\u2019s job to make sure the crypto payments aren\u2019t the proceeds of criminal activity or being used to launder money or evade taxes.\n\n\u201cThis will help us connect to people who are not necessarily our clients but might afford a Ferrari,\u201d Ferrari\u2019s Chief Marketing and Commercial Officer Enrico Galliera, told Reuters. \u201cPrices will not change, no fees, no surcharges if you pay through cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nRelated: Tesla Stops Accepting Bitcoin As Payment Due To Environmental Concerns\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time an automaker has accepted crypto payments. Tesla announced it would accept Bitcoin payments in 2021, but then reversed that decision citing concerns over the amount of fossil fuels used in Bitcoin mining. Ferrari\u2019s Galliera says that cryptocurrencies have increased efforts to reduce their carbon footprint though new software and by replacing fossil fuel-derived energy with renewables in the mining process, and claims that accepting digital currencies does not derail Ferrari\u2019s own green plans.\n\nEarlier this year, it was reported that Tesla could be about to take crypto payments again. Code was was spotted on Tesla\u2019s retail website suggesting that Bitcoin would be reinstated as a payment method."

        "title": "Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF push: What\u2019s next after court ruling stands - The Times of India",
        "content": "With the Securities and Exchange Commission opting against appealing a ruling that paves the way for Grayscale Investments LLC to convert its Bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund, analysts are now trying to gauge how the process may unfold from here.The crypto asset-manager earlier this year scored a legal victory in federal court in its bid to turn its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (ticker GBTC) into the first US ETF that would invest directly in the largest digital coin.The SEC faced a Friday deadline to appeal the ruling. The agency is not planning any other appeals in the case, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing the ongoing matter.What\u2019s likely to occur is that dialog between Grayscale and the SEC is going to open up, according to James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cWe\u2019ll get more information next week and then we\u2019ll know what happens next,\u201d he said. Seyffart added that the regulator has the option to file an appeal with the Supreme Court, though he views that as highly unlikely to happen.The SEC didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the agency\u2019s plans for spot Bitcoin ETFs.Grayscale has argued that a conversion of GBTC into an ETF could unlock billions in value for its holders. Its court win was seen as monumental for the industry because it sparked excitement within the digital-assets community that a Bitcoin ETF could, after a decade-long battle, finally be had in the US. The SEC had been hesitant in the past to give a green-light. But there are currently a slew of companies, including BlackRock Inc. and Invesco, among others, trying to get such a product launched.Immediately following the Grayscale ruling in August, shares of GBTC rallied more than did Bitcoin itself, with the trust\u2019s discount to its underlying holdings narrowing significantly. The gap earlier this year stood above 45% but has constricted to below 20%, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A slew of high-profile investors including Cathie Wood and Boaz Weinstein appear to have been well positioned for the narrowing, having scooped up GBTC shares at the height of its recent distress.Progress on the Grayscale conversion-front brings further clarity to the ETF-approval process, which has remained opaque to industry watchers as many were unsure about how the SEC would handle the asset-manager\u2019s proceedings, as well as the numerous other outstanding applications. A key remaining question is whether the regulator will allow multiple Bitcoin ETFs to launch all at once.Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence argue that a recent update to an application from ARK and 21Shares signals a \u201cconstructive conversation\u201d with regulators that typically only happens when an ETF is on its way to approval. They say there\u2019s a 90% chance of SEC approval by around Jan. 10."

        "title": "Across US, Chinese Bitcoin mines draw national security scrutiny - The Business Times",
        "content": "WHEN a company with Chinese origins broke ground last year on a crypto-mining operation in Cheyenne, Wyoming, a team at Microsoft that assesses national security threats sounded the alarm.\n\nNot only was the site next door to a Microsoft data center that supported the Pentagon, but it was also about 1 mile away from an Air Force base that controlled nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nThe location could allow the Chinese to \u201cpursue full-spectrum intelligence collection operations,\u201d the Microsoft team wrote in an August 2022 report to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a federal body that monitors threats posed by overseas investors.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s warning did not go unheeded. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, US government officials told The New York Times last week that they had been tracking the Wyoming operation for months. One official said that measures had been taken to mitigate potential intelligence collection but declined to elaborate. In addition, the mining company said it responded to queries from the federal investment committee.\n\nThe national security concerns about the Wyoming site, previously unreported, reflect a broader unease about a recent surge in Chinese bitcoin mines across the country.\n\nAside from intelligence-gathering worries, the mines, which are large warehouses or containers packed with specialized computers, put immense pressure on power grids. The computers typically run around the clock while \u201cmining\u201d for the digital coins, the most popular among the various cryptocurrencies.\n\nSEE ALSO Hong Kong issues new national security law bill with tougher jail terms\n\nGET BT IN YOUR INBOX DAILY Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. Sign Up VIEW ALL\n\nBrian Harrell, a former assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at the Department of Homeland Security during the Trump administration, said the operations could place \u201cenormous stress\u201d on the grid if the mines worked in concert to wreak havoc.\n\nPossibilities include targeted blackouts and cyberattacks.\n\nIn at least 12 states \u2013 including Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming \u2013 the Times identified Chinese-owned or Chinese-operated bitcoin mines that together use as much energy as 1.5 million homes. At full capacity, the Cheyenne mine would require enough electricity to power 55,000 houses.\n\nMany of the mines are equipped with computers made by Bitmain, a Chinese company that has no apparent direct connection to Chinese authorities but, according to import records, has sent some shipments to the United States through a subsidiary located at a Communist Party site in southern China.\n\nSince bitcoin mining was banned in China in May 2021 over concerns about energy usage and economic destabilization, Bitmain has shipped 15 times more equipment to the United States than it did in the previous five years combined, the records show. A recent presentation by the company claimed it controlled 90 per cent of the global market for the equipment.\n\nSome of the US mining operations appear to be straightforward efforts by wealthy Chinese nationals to make money outside the purview of Chinese authorities. For others, the ownership is opaque, while several can be traced to the Chinese government.\n\nCourt documents show that the mine in Cheyenne is linked to five companies, all using the same office on Park Avenue in New York City. One of them is registered in the Cayman Islands and until last year was a Chinese pork-processing company. The Times did not find any links between the owners of the Cheyenne mine and the Chinese government or Communist Party.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft has no direct indications of malicious activities by this entity,\u201d Microsoft said in its 16-page report. \u201cHowever, pending further discovery, we suggest the possibility that the computing power of an industrial-level crypto-mining operation, along with the presence of an unidentified number of Chinese nationals in direct proximity to Microsoft\u2019s Data Center and one of three strategic-missile bases in the US, provides significant threat vectors.\u201d\n\nThe new risks come amid a steep rise in bitcoin mining in the US. This year, a Times investigation found that operations were consuming about 4,000 megawatts \u2013 enough to power more than 3 million US households \u2013 and that more megawatts were continuously coming online.\n\nThe operations\u2019 vast energy consumption, combined with their ability to turn on or off almost instantly, is unique among large power users. The combination allows many to participate in programs that pay them to shut down when a grid is under strain.\n\nThat flexibility can help keep the lights on, but it can also disrupt the delicate balance grids require.\n\nMany mines also have digital connections with grid operators that could allow intrusions into critical systems.\n\nIn July, an official with the North American Electric Reliability, which oversees protection of the power grid, told Congress about the growing threat of Chinese cyberattacks.\n\nThe Chertoff Group, a prominent security advisory firm, has been approached by several \u201ccritical infrastructure providers\u201d for advice about the risks posed by bitcoin miners, particularly those owned by the Chinese, said Ben Joelson, one of the firm\u2019s security experts.\n\nIn many parts of the country, the frustration is palpable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all worked up over TikTok, but nobody seems to be saying anything about these Chinese companies connecting to our grids,\u201d said Bryan King, a Republican state senator in Arkansas whose district includes the city of Harrison, where a Chinese investment group has purchased land for a bitcoin mine. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nThe influx of mining in Texas has already begun to affect the state grid, one of the most vulnerable in the country because it is unconnected to others outside the state.\n\nThe grid\u2019s operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, recently reported that bitcoin mines\u2019 energy consumption and lack of transparency had resulted in forecasting errors. The mines can \u201cmagnify the severity of grid events,\u201d impacting reliability, the company said.\n\nOne proposal to reduce this risk is to regulate how fast the mines can start or stop using energy.\n\nChinese cryptocurrency mines have quickly entrenched themselves in Texas and are learning to adapt to its politics.\n\nOne company, Poolin, set up by a Bitmain veteran, runs a pair of mines in West Texas that together can draw on as much as 600 megawatts of energy, enough to power nearly 500,000 US homes. The company\u2019s founder, Kevin Pan, is a Chinese citizen who has celebrated the warm embrace he and his company have received in Texas.\n\nAt a company celebration last year, he was seen wearing a cowboy hat and challenging guests to a one-armed pushup contest.\n\n\u201cI feel so lucky we chose Texas,\u201d Pan said. \u201cWe chose America.\u201d NYTIMES"
