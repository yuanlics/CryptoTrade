        "title": "What's a Better Buy: Bitcoin or Ethereum? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The debate between Bitcoin (BTC 0.53%) and Ethereum (ETH -0.42%) as a better investment has been a hot topic in the cryptocurrency community for years. Both are popular and established cryptocurrencies, but there are key differences between them that make Bitcoin a better investment. The reason for this belief can be boiled down to three simple reasons.\n\n1. The market cap difference\n\nMarket capitalization, or \"market cap,\" refers to the total value of a company or asset. In the case of cryptocurrencies, it is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in circulation by the current market price of each coin. As of April 1, 2023, Bitcoin has a market cap of over $545 billion, while Ethereum's market cap is just under $220 billion.\n\nEssentially what this means is that Bitcoin is currently a more established asset than Ethereum and makes up a disproportionate amount of value in the entire crypto asset class. As of today, Bitcoin accounts for more than 45% of all the value in crypto.\n\nIts higher market cap indicates that it has more adoption and more trust among investors. Additionally, it suggests that Bitcoin is less volatile than Ethereum, as it would take a larger amount of money to move its price significantly.\n\n2. Increasing scarcity\n\nOne of the most significant differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum is their supply. Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, which means that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins in circulation. Currently, there are around 19.3 million circulating, with the remaining 1.7 million yet to be mined. Even better, though, these remaining 1.7 million bitcoins will be released at a diminishing rate for the next 117 years until the last bitcoin is mined.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin's inflation rate is a minimal 1.7%. However, due to the gradual decrease in the rate of new coins being created, it is estimated that by 2056, this number will fall below 0.1%. By the year 2100, Bitcoin's inflation rate will be somewhere around 0.000001%. No matter the asset, an inflation rate this low helps to ensure that prices are not only maintained but grow as demand competes for a more limited supply.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has no hard cap. While it does have a mechanism known as burning to remove ether from circulation, there is, technically, no overall limit on the number of ether which could enter the market. Unlike Bitcoin, this means that Ethereum is subject to unknown levels of inflation, which can decrease the value of each individual coin over time.\n\n3. Decentralization and security\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin has a stronger track record when it comes to security and decentralization. Bitcoin's blockchain is the most secure and decentralized of any cryptocurrency, with thousands of nodes and miners around the world helping to verify transactions and maintain the network. This makes it less susceptible to hacking or manipulation than Ethereum, which has had several high-profile security incidents in the past. Additionally, Bitcoin's decentralized nature means that it is not subject to the same level of centralization or regulation as Ethereum, which has been criticized for being too closely tied to its founders and developers.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin has a more established and secure network than Ethereum. Bitcoin's network has been operating securely for well over a decade, and its underlying proof-of-work technology has proven to be reliable and resistant to attacks. Ethereum, on the other hand, has had some security issues in the past, including a major hack in 2016 that resulted in the loss of millions of dollars worth of ether. While Ethereum's security has improved over time, it still lags behind Bitcoin in terms of reliability and security.\n\nKeep it simple\n\nWhile Ethereum might be deserving of a spot in your portfolio, Bitcoin provides investors with a safer and more dependable option. Likely the greatest advantage Bitcoin has over Ethereum is its simplicity. Bitcoin's value proposition is clear and easy to understand: it is a highly decentralized and secure digital store of value that provides holders with reliability.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has a more complex value proposition that is tied to its smart contract functionality and decentralized applications. While this complexity can be appealing to some investors, it also makes Ethereum more difficult to understand and evaluate as an investment, as many of these use cases are in their beginning stages.\n\nFor investors looking to keep it simple and wanting to invest in cryptocurrency, look no further than the original digital asset, Bitcoin."

The company, founded in 2015, had grown to employ more than 200 people in four offices around the world, with $5 billion traded on Paxful by more than 12 million users over the course of its existence, according to court filings."

        "content": "Bitcoin is a wasteful asset that doesn't add to global welfare, Dieter Wermuth, economist and partner at Wermuth Asset Management, wrote in a recent note.\n\nHe says the bitcoin market is highly centralized, and primarily benefits early investors and miners.\n\nThe tokens fail as currency, given their high volatility and lack of real-world use, according to Wermuth.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite calls from crypto enthusiasts to HODL (hold on for dear life), letting go of bitcoin may be good for world prosperity, at least according to one economist.\n\nThat's because the cryptocurrency is a wasteful investment that takes funds away from general economic growth, Dieter Wermuth \u2014 economist and partner at Wermuth Asset Management \u2014 wrote in a note published on Wednesday.\n\nNot only does the speculative asset not contribute to broader welfare, it creates social inequalities and allows for money laundering, tax evasion and major climate deterioration, Wermuth said.\n\n\"Bitcoin activities are a negative-sum game,\" he wrote. \"Without crypto, the economy would be better off \u2014 there would be more money for consumption and investment.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetailed below are three reasons to support Wermuth's negative assertions about bitcoin.\n\n(1) It doesn't distribute wealth equally\n\nAfter the front-and-center cryptocurrency bitcoin first launched in 2009, it went from being a virtually worthless asset to holding a level of nearly $68,000 by 2021. But Wermuth argues that the gains were not enjoyed by every investor; rather, an uneven wealth distribution formed that favored crypto insiders.\n\nTo illustrate, a 2021 Wall Street Journal article reported that 0.01% of bitcoin investors held 27% of coins then in circulation, or approximately $232 billion at the time.\n\nWermuth notes that coin-producing crypto miners and those who had positions long before the 2021 rally overwhelmingly profited from the currency's gains, while those who joined late helped make the initial investors richer \u2014 only to potentially undergo losses themselves when bitcoin crashed by around 75% in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(2) It's not really a currency\n\nThe intense volatility that bitcoin has experienced through its history also demonstrates how ill-equipped it is for a monetary role.\n\n\"Bitcoin has been brought to market with the narrative that it would be a better, more stable currency than traditional money,\" Wermuth wrote. \"This story has been a deception.\"\n\nHis assertion runs on the premise that money needs to attain three core roles \u2014 as a means of payment, unit of account and store of value \u2014 all of which bitcoin performs poorly at.\n\nIn order to facilitate stability, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have a limit to the amount of tokens that will enter circulation. However, this is quickly undone when investors treat it as an investment and create more daily volatility than other markets, Wermuth said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, he cites the fact that bitcoin has yet to have widespread use as a purchasing device, and hasn't been accepted as a means to pay taxes. Transfers between bitcoin accounts, meanwhile, continue to be slower and more expensive than traditional ones.\n\n(3) It's a negative-sum asset\n\nDespite the elements outlined above, bitcoin generates a great deal of financial liquidity without any proof that it contributes to productivity growth, Wermuth said.\n\n\"Back in November 2021 bitcoin's market capitalization reached 1.27 trillion dollars,\" he wrote. \"When Lehman Brothers went belly-up in 2008, a smaller amount of money had triggered the largest financial crisis and the deepest recession of the post-World War period.\"\n\nOn top of that, the process of bitcoin mining \u2014 which uses computer hardware to add transactions in the crypto to a blockchain in return for newly minted coins \u2014 is so energy intensive that Wermuth described it as a \"major climate killer.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBroader crypto-market issues\n\nHis note comes at a time of high-profile challenges for the broader crypto world \u2014 ones that may have started deteriorating investor confidence in the asset.\n\nMost recently, the collapse of the crypto-friendly Signature Bank revealed that it had faced a US probe indicating that its crypto clients may have been taking part in money laundering. At the same time, crypto-exchange Binance is facing a US lawsuit, with one of the allegations citing that it knew that it was facilitating criminal transactions.\n\nBefore that, November's FTX collapse demonstrated the risks for crypto investors operating in the unregulated market, as many of the lender's clients saw their holdings wiped out.\n\n\"I wonder whether it will be enough to just step up regulatory efforts, or to forbid the participation of banks and other financial institutions \u2014 or to get rid of these markets altogether (if this is still an option),\" he wrote."

        "content": "A bill seeking to regulate Bitcoin (BTC) mining activity in Arkansas has passed in the state\u2019s House of Representatives and Senate. The bill will now move to the governor\u2019s office for approval.\n\nAccording to the bill, the Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023 intends to regulate the Bitcoin mining industry in the American state, creating guidelines for miners and protecting them from discriminatory regulations and taxes.\n\nArkansas\u2019 state legislators quickly passed the bill after it was proposed on March 30 by Senator Joshua Bryant. The document recognizes \u201cthat data centers create jobs, pay taxes, and provide general economic value to local communities.\u201c\n\nArkansas Data Centers Act of 2023. Source: Arkansas State Legislature\n\nAs per the approved bill, a digital asset miner is required \u201cto pay applicable taxes and government fees in acceptable forms of currency and operate in a manner that causes no stress on an electric public utility\u2019s generation capabilities or transmission network.\u201c\n\nUnder the legislation, crypto miners will also have the same rights as data centers. The bill outlines that Arkansas\u2019 government should not \u201cimpose a different requirement for a digital asset mining business than is applicable to any requirement for a data center.\u201c\n\nRelated: Crypto mining in 2023 \u2014 Is it still worth it? Watch Market Talks\n\nArkansas\u2019 move follows a similar initiative in the state of Montana. In late March, the Montana Senate passed a bill to protect crypto miners operating within the state. The bill intends to protect miners against taxes on digital assets used for payments, and to eliminate energy rates discriminating against home crypto miners and digital assets businesses.\n\nThe state of Texas went in a different direction. Its Senate Committee on Business and Commerce passed legislation on April 4 that would essentially remove incentives for miners operating under the state\u2019s crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Cointelegraph reported.\n\nAn even more decisive move came from New York in November 2022 when Governor Kathy Hochul signed the proof-of-work mining moratorium into law, banning crypto-mining activities in the state for two years. On a federal level, crypto miners in the United States could eventually be subject to a 30% tax on electricity costs under a budget proposal introduced on March 9 by President Joe Biden aimed to \u201creduce mining activity.\u201d\n\nMagazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime"

The document appears to have been added as a sample file for that utility, and it may just have been a useful, short document to use as an example.\n\nThe secret document was found by Andy Baio, the blogger and technologist. He noted that despite the file being inside the software for five years, there was very little discussion of it online.\n\nApple has not given any information about how the file came to be added to MacOS. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Independent.\n\nMr Baio said that he had received a tip-off that the existence was filed as an issue a year ago, and that it was assigned to the engineer who added it, but that there has not been any update since.\n\nOfficially, Apple has stayed largely separate from cryptocurrency, even as it moves into more traditional financial services such as payments and lending.\n\nIn 2021, chief executive Tim Cook said Apple was \u201clooking at\u201d cryptocurrencies and that he had invested in it personally.

        "content": "Bitcoin mining difficulty continues to break records despite the struggles of BTC to surpass the $30,000 resistance mark. The leading coin has attracted the interest of miners in recent months due to the price recovery experienced since the turn of the year.\n\nBitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits New Record\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty moved to an all-time high on April 6, 2023, following the most recent mining difficulty adjustment on its blockchain network. The mining difficulty rose for the fourth consecutive time and reached 47.8 trillion, an increase of 2.3%.\n\nThe Bitcoin mining difficulty automatically adjusts every 2,016 blocks \u2013 approximately two weeks \u2013 to maintain the 10-minute block creation time. There has been a steady increase in mining difficulty in recent weeks, with the last downward trend recorded on February 11.\n\nOne of the consequences is reflected in the hash price, which is the rate of profit miners make for the hashrate they provide to the Bitcoin network. In theory, a higher mining difficulty leads to a lower hash price. This is because more miners are contributing computing power than normal, leading to more competition for the rewards that the Bitcoin network provides miners that produce new blocks on the network.\n\nRelated Reading: Buckle Up! Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Signal An Impending Rollercoaster Ride\n\nFurthermore, the Bitcoin hashrate or processing power can indicate the degree of mining difficulty. At the time of the mining difficulty adjustment that preceded the latest one, BTC\u2019s hash rate was at a record high leading to increased mining difficulty.\n\nHowever, this has changed recently, with the hashrate falling by an average of 20 EH/s this week. It should be noted that Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate varies as measured by different sources. For example, BTC.com places the metric at 338 EH/s, and mempool places this at a slightly higher metric of 347/ EH/s\n\nBullish Market A Major Reason For Increased Mining Difficulty\n\nBitcoin has appreciated by more than 50% since the start of 2023, leading to calls for a bullish market. Unsurprisingly this positive trend has led to many miners reconnecting their equipment after a difficult 2022.\n\nRelated Reading: Uniswap Who? Trader Joe\u2019s AMM Takes DeFi By Storm\n\nThe collapse of Terra Luna and subsequent fallout from FTX led to significant bearish pressure on the market, with several coins taking steep price declines. Bitcoin was one of the coins to dip, leading to a difficult year for miners, with many having to sell their equipment or shut down operations to stay afloat.\n\nHowever, the bull run of 2023 has raised expectations from miners that the market could be on its way to previous levels. Nonetheless, the crypto mining sector has not been without its difficulties, with friendly places like Texas in the United States planning to tighten regulations on electricity that could affect the booming sector soon.\n\nFeatured image from unsplash, charts from mempool and Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin Q2 Fundamental Outlook\n\nBitcoin prices enjoyed a 60% rally in the first quarter, allowing the largest cryptocurrency to recover a fair portion of last year\u2019s losses. As fears of financial instability continue to drive risk sentiment, Bitcoin prices have surged and could continue to be driven by the same systemic risks in the second quarter.\n\nIn Q2 of 2023, the main factors to watch are:\n\nRecession fears (rising risks of a recession could be a major headwind for speculative assets if the banking sector regains confidence).\n\n(rising risks of a recession could be a major headwind for speculative assets if the banking sector regains confidence). Inflation and monetary policy (ECB and the Federal Reserve have reiterated their intention to raise rates in inflation remains elevated).\n\n(ECB and the Federal Reserve have reiterated their intention to raise rates in inflation remains elevated). Financial regulations imposed on digital currency and a potential Lawsuit between the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) and Coinbase (one of the largest crypto exchanges). Depending on the developments and the outcome, this could be another risk factor to monitor closely.\n\nWill Systemic Risks Make or Break Bitcoin?\n\nAfter a strong start to 2023, prices rallied nearly 40%, before settling at a key level of technical resistance around the September 2022 high of $22,781. As Fed expectations continued to drive sentiment, a robust labor market and persistently high levels of inflation opened the door for the Federal Reserve to consider raising rates more aggressively.\n\nStocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies, to a certain extent, do not earn interest, so a high-interest rate environment does not bode well for these non-yielding assets. After a series of aggressive rate hikes throughout 2022, markets had expected the pace of monetary policy tightening to ease. However, as the Fed and the ECB remained fixated on fulfilling the objectives of the dual mandate (to achieve full employment and price stability), inflation remained well above the 2% target. This caused both major central banks to consider hiking rates more aggressively to tame price pressures.\n\nSource: Refinitiv\n\nWill Contagion from the Banking Crisis Continue to Support Digital Assets?\n\nHowever, following the collapse of SVB (Silicon Valley Bank), Signature Bank, and the ongoing problems at First Republic Bank, pressure mounted on the Fed to consider pausing its rate cycle.\n\nAlthough the financial sector remains vulnerable to contagion that could result in an increase in the number of bank failures, the probability of additional rate hikes has been reduced. Instead, many expect the Fed to announce rate cuts by the end of the year.\n\nSource: Refinitiv\n\nAs a result, the combination of the eroding credibility of the banking sector, a weaker US Dollar, and a potential Fed pivot has boosted the appeal of digital assets. As Bitcoin and its major counterparts continue to monitor the geopolitical backdrop, fundamentals will likely remain as the primary catalyst for price action. With prices currently trading at their highest level since June last year, both technical and fundamentals could assist in driving the prominent trend."

        "content": "The long weekend has not produced any fireworks in Bitcoin (BTC) price, which continues to trade inside an ever-narrowing range. Bitcoin is on track to form a third consecutive Doji candlestick pattern on the weekly chart. This suggests that the Bitcoin bulls and the bears are not clear about the next directional move.\n\nIt is not only Bitcoin that is stuck inside a range. On April 7, Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at asset manager Fidelity Investments, tweeted that the S&P 500 Index had been stuck inside a range for the past nine months and a breakout was due \u201csooner or later.\u201d\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nBitcoin\u2019s failure to break above the $30,000 level has attracted profit-booking in several altcoins but a few have witnessed shallow pullbacks. This indicates that traders are holding on to their positions expecting a move higher.\n\nLet\u2019s study the charts of select altcoins that may turn up and start an uptrend if Bitcoin breaks out to the upside. What are the resistance levels above which these five cryptocurrencies turn bullish?\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been trading inside a tight range for the past two days, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. Usually, tight ranges are followed by an expansion in volatility.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day exponential moving average ($27,500) is flattening out and the relative strength index (RSI) has gradually been slipping toward the center. This suggests a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the price tumbles below the 20-day EMA, several short-term stop losses may be triggered and the BTC/USDT pair may dive to the breakout level of $25,250.\n\nConversely, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying the dips. A rally above $29,200 could enhance the prospects of a rally to $30,000 and subsequently to $32,500.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA is flattening out on the four-hour chart and the RSI is just below the midpoint. This does not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. This uncertainty is unlikely to continue for long, and a directional move could soon start. However, it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout.\n\nTherefore, it is better to wait for the breakout to happen before establishing directional bets. The important level to watch on the upside is $29,200 and on the downside is $26,500. A breach of either level could start a short-term trending move.\n\nCardano price analysis\n\nThe bulls are not allowing Cardano (ADA) to dip below the 20-day EMA ($0.37), indicating demand at lower levels.\n\nADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive area suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. The ADA/USDT pair could first rise to the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. A break and close above this resistance will signal a potential trend change. The pair could then rally toward the pattern target of $0.60.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to quickly yank the price back below the 20-day EMA. The pair may then drop to the 200-day simple moving average ($0.35) and later to $0.30.\n\nADA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls have pushed the price above the 20-EMA and will next try to overcome the barrier at the downtrend line. If they do that, it will suggest that the pullback may be over. The pair may then climb to the neckline where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense.\n\nContrarily, if the price faces rejection at the downtrend line, it will suggest that bears are active at higher levels. The selling could accelerate below $0.37 and the pair may plunge to the 200-SMA.\n\nStellar price analysis\n\nStellar (XLM) turned down from the overhead resistance of $0.12 and the price is nearing the 20-day EMA ($0.10). The bulls are likely to buy the dips to the 20-day EMA.\n\nXLM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to clear the overhead hurdle. If they succeed, the XLM/USDT pair will complete a bullish rounding bottom pattern. That could signal the start of a new up-move. The pair may first rally to $0.15 and thereafter march toward the pattern target of $0.17.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bulls are losing their grip. The pair may then drop to the 200-day SMA ($0.09). This is a make-or-break level for the bulls because if it cracks, the pair may plummet to $0.07.\n\nXLM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair is correcting inside a falling wedge pattern. The price has bounced off the support line and the bulls will next attempt to propel the pair above the wedge. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $0.11 and subsequently to $0.12.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price turns down and plummets below the support line, it will suggest that the selling has intensified. There is a small support at $0.10 but if that cracks, the decline could extend to the 200-SMA.\n\nRelated: SushiSwap approval bug leads to $3.3 million exploit\n\nAave price analysis\n\nAave (AAVE) has turned down from the overhead resistance of $82, indicating that the bears are fiercely protecting this level. They have pulled the price below the immediate support at the 20-day EMA ($75).\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe AAVE/USDT pair could next slip to the 200-day SMA ($73), which is close to the uptrend line. Buyers are likely to defend this level with vigor. If the price rebounds off the uptrend line and breaks above the 20-day EMA, the pair could reach $82.\n\nIf bulls overcome this barrier, the pair will complete an ascending triangle pattern. This setup has a target objective of $100. This bullish view will invalidate if the price continues lower and breaks below the uptrend line. The pair may then slide to $68 and later to $64.\n\nAAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears have pulled the price to the 200-SMA on the four-hour chart. The 20-EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating that bears have the upper hand.\n\nIf the 200-SMA gives way, the pair could decline further to the uptrend line. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it will further strengthen the bears.\n\nOn the upside, a break above the 20-EMA will be the first sign that the bulls are making a comeback. The pair may then rise to the overhead resistance at $82.\n\nCFX price analysis\n\nConflux (CFX) has been in a corrective phase for the past few days but a minor positive is that the bulls are trying to defend the 20-day EMA ($0.36).\n\nCFX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf the price rebounds off the current level, the CFX/USDT pair could reach the downtrend line. This is an important level for the bears to guard because a break above it could open the doors for a possible rally to $0.44 and then $0.49.\n\nConversely, if the price plunges and sustains below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls may be rushing to the exit. That could attract further selling, pulling the price toward the next support at $0.30. The bulls are expected to buy the dips to this level.\n\nCFX/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to keep the price below the 20-EMA. That could pull the pair to the 200-SMA, which is likely to act as a major support.\n\nIf the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will again try to drive the price to the downtrend line. This is the key level to keep an eye on because a break above it will signal that bulls are back in the game.\n\nOn the downside, a break and close below the $0.30 support could attract further selling, sinking the price to $0.25.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Ethereum Shanghai hard fork: ETH price set for more gains versus Bitcoin in April - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ether (ETH) dropped by over 7.5% in its Bitcoin (BTC) pair in 2023. But ETH/BTC may wipe its year-to-date losses entirely in April, as Ethereum\u2019s long-awaited Shanghai hard fork is just days away.\n\nThe upgrade is set for April 12, enabling Ethereum stakers to withdraw around 1.1 billion ETH in rewards \u2014 worth over $2 billion as of April 8.\n\nETH price undergoes key technical bounce\n\nMany experts see the hard fork as bullish for Ether in the long term. For instance, the Shanghai buzz has helped Ether outperform Bitcoin in April.\n\nAs a result, the ETH/BTC pair has risen by about 4.75% month-to-date to reach 0.066 BTC as of April 8, a nearly 8% rebound since March 20.\n\nThe bounce was largely expected, particularly as ETH/BTC dropped to its historical ascending trendline support. Now, the upside move raises the prospects of an extended bullish retracement toward its descending trendline resistance, marked as a \u201csell zone\u201d in the chart below.\n\nETH/BTC three-day price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe fractal-based outlook puts Ether on target for 0.075 BTC by June, up 10% versus current price levels. Meanwhile, the pair\u2019s upside target for April appears to be its 50-3D exponential moving average (50-3D EMA; the red wave) near 0.069 BTC.\n\nConversely, a decisive close below the 200-3D EMA (the blue wave) near 0.066 BTC, coinciding support/resistance level near 0.067 BTC, risks delaying or \u2014 in the worst case scenario \u2014 invalidating the bullish retracement setup.\n\nThis bearish argument echoes independent market analyst CrediBULL Crypto who expects strong selling pressure near the 0.067 BTC resistance level that would lead to a 50% drop in 2023.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView/CrediBULL Crypto\n\nEthereum vs. U.S. dollar outlook\n\nThe ETH/USD pair has rallied by more than 50% in 2023, primarily due to similar uptrends elsewhere in the crypto market.\n\nA weakening dollar, lower U.S. Treasury yields and expectations of a Federal Reserve pivot on interest rate hikes have helped cryptocurrencies rise across the board in Q1. These catalysts will likely remain in the spotlight until May\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\n\nShanghai bringing the first greenshoots of #AltcoinSeason ?$ETH is perking up to an 8 month high as we approach one week until the Shanghai fork update @ 10:27:35 PM UTC on the 12th (Epoch #620,9536)\n\n\n\nThe rally has mostly been a Fed/USD rates story, causing BTC to lead the way.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/dI0bpywR16 \u2014 Rich Rosenblum (@Rich_GSR) April 4, 2023\n\nAs a result, Ether could sustain its yearly gains in April, consolidating inside the $1,800\u20132,000 range until the Fed decision.\n\nRelated: 3 key Ethereum price metrics cast doubt on the strength of ETH\u2019s recent rally\n\nMoreover, a decisive breakout at current levels could result in extended gains with a second-quarter ETH price target of over $3,000.\n\nETH/USD three-day price chart.

An April 5 blog post from technologist Andy Baio revealed that a PDF of the Bitcoin white paper has \u201capparently shipped with every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018.\u201d Baio told Cointelegraph he was trying to fix his printer and scan a document when Nakamoto\u2019s white paper first appeared. He created a prompt in Terminal that enables others to easily access the white paper.\n\nBinance Australia Derivatives license canceled by securities regulator\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission has canceled the license of Binance Australia Derivatives after a targeted review of its operations in the country. The company\u2019s clients will not be able to increase derivatives positions or open new positions with the platform from April 14, and existing derivatives positions must be closed before April 21.

Its team, however, resigned after FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. Now, many scholars and researchers who were early recipients of the grant are now stuck in limbo over payment of further grants for their programs, while many studying on the FTX grant were forced to drop out of their courses due to the fear of repayment. FTX Future Fund\u2019s grants were focused on research projects for the safe development of artificial intelligence, reducing catastrophic bio-risk, improving institutions, economic growth, great power relations and effective altruism, among many others.\n\nElon Musk changes Twitter icon to Doge after seeking lawsuit dismissal\n\nTwitter\u2019s traditional bird mascot was replaced on April 3 with an image of a Shiba Inu, the icon of the popular meme token Dogecoin. The update came two days after the social media platform\u2019s CEO Elon Musk asked a United States judge to dismiss a $258 billion lawsuit filed by investors alleging the operation of a pyramid scheme to promote Dogecoin. Musk\u2019s lawyers, however, argue that \u201cfunny pictures\u201d and \u201ctweeting words of support\u201d do not amount to a fraud claim. As for this week, the marketing move positively impacted the altcoin\u2019s price, with the DOGE token surging by over 22% one hour after the icon was changed.\n\nUS Bitcoin reaches tentative settlement to reopen Niagara Falls mining facility\n\nCrypto miner US Bitcoin Corp has come to a tentative agreement with the City of Niagara Falls that will allow it to reopen its local mining operation, according to media reports. A state supreme court judge ordered its plant closed in early March. The settlement still requires the approval of the city council. Under the potential agreement, the company will have to pay $150,000 in fees to the city and $180,000 to reimburse legal costs and new application fees, alongside a $1 million fine. US Bitcoin Corp must also implement measures to reduce noise at the plant, including building a noise-dampening wall and submitting to third-party monitoring.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $27,928, Ether (ETH) at $1,857 and XRP at $0.51.

The mining farm will tap into Tesla's energy storage technology with rechargeable large-scale batteries at the site, Adam Back, chief executive of Blockstream, said at the Bitcoin Conference 2022 in Miami. Back didn't specify the location.\n\nThe venture is the latest manifestation of the aligning interests of Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and Twitter co-founder Dorsey, including over the energy usage of Bitcoin. Earlier this week, Dorsey said he was happy that Musk joined the board of directors of Twitter after Musk revealed his sizable stake in the social media giant.\n\nMusk expressed his interest in Bitcoin and Dogecoin early last year and allowed Tesla customers to buy the electric cars with Bitcoin, helping to send the crypto market to record highs. However, the carmaker later suspended the Bitcoin payment opening citing environmental concerns over Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe latest move comes after Block, which is formerly known as digital payment company Square, secured a purchase from Intel Corp.'s Bitcoin mining chip. Buyers of the chip can potentially either make their own mining rigs or receive an assembled machine from the chipmaker.\n\nDorsey revealed the plan to decentralize Bitcoin mining and make the token's network more secure with Block earlier this year.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Dorsey has fully embraced the largest cryptocurrency by including Bitcoin micropayment Lightening Network in Twitter's tipping function and launching the NFT profile function. He has funded Bitcoin developers and planned to decentralize Bitcoin mining.\n\nTesla's first-quarter filing disclosed the company held $2.48 billion in Bitcoin as of March 31.

        "title": "Bitcoin Miners Earn Over $755 Million in March 2023 Alone as Hashrate Hits All-Time Highs - bitcoinke.io",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty, the amount of effort and time needed to find a proper hash for each blockchain block, continues to increase as of April 7 2023.\n\nThe latest #Bitcoin block difficulty adjustment pushes the difficulty metric to 47.89 trillion \u2013 another record high. As a result, it's harder than ever to mine a Bitcoin block. pic.twitter.com/rAVb9SdUgI \u2014 BitKE (@BitcoinKE) April 8, 2023\n\nThe mining difficulty of Bitcoin is adjusted automatically approximately every two weeks in response to changes in the hashrate of the network. This adjustment is necessary to maintain a block processing time of approximately 10 minutes and prevent the network from either slowing down or speeding up over time.\n\nThe latest rise in Bitcoin mining difficulty marks the fourth consecutive increase, with the previous three increases being 9.95%, 1.16%, and 7.56% as highlighted on btc.com. These increases indicate that the network has been responding to the gradual growth of the hashrate.\n\nThe most recent adjustment to the block difficulty has pushed the difficulty metric to a new all-time high of 47.89 trillion, making it more challenging than ever to mine a block and obtain a bitcoin. The next difficulty adjustment is expected to occur in about 12 days.\n\nThe average computation power, or hashrate, of the entire Bitcoin network has also reached an all-time high of 342.16 EH/s. Meanwhile, the average block verification and production time, known as block times, remains below ten minutes.\n\nAt the same time, while bitcoin\u2019s network difficulty and hash rate increased, making the network more expensive to mine, so has miner revenue increased. Miners receive bitcoins, the native currency of the blockchain, as a reward for validating blocks and processing transactions. The revenue earned by miners takes into account both inflation rewards, known as block subsidies, and transaction fees.\n\nWhile most miner revenue comes from the block subsidy \u2013 6.25 BTC per block right now \u2013 which is a constant in BTC terms, transaction fees are also a way for miners to generate revenue.\n\nIn March 2023, bitcoin miners earned almost $732 million from block subsidies, which is their primary source of revenue. When transaction fees are added to this figure, their total earnings amounted to $755 million. Despite this increase, their profitability still falls significantly below the all-time highs.\n\nThe rise in revenue for bitcoin miners is closely linked to the value of the cryptocurrency they are mining. Since the beginning of the year, the price of bitcoin has surged by 69%, and in the past month alone, it has risen by nearly 26%. This increase in value has more than offset the higher costs associated with mining resulting in higher profitability for miners.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFollow us on Twitter for the latest posts and updates\n\nJoin and interact with our Telegram community\n\n_____________________________________\n\n_____________________________________"

        "title": "Paris Emerges as the Next Crypto Hub: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Signuptoken.com are Three Altcoins to Watch - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Paris is positioning itself as the next major hub for the cryptocurrency industry, despite the closure of several crypto-friendly banks and the failure of FTX. The French government is showing support for the crypto industry and blockchain technology, with President Emmanuel Macron seeing cryptocurrency as a way to attract businesses to the region. This has significant implications for major crypto coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as newer tokens such as Signuptoken.com.\n\nSignuptoken.com: A Revolutionary Crypto Project\n\nSignuptoken.com is a new crypto project with a unique concept. Its goal is to create generational wealth by registering a single email that will help subscribers retire early. The project aims to accumulate one million email subscribers before launching its token on Uniswap. Currently, Signuptoken.com has already accumulated 3,000 email subscribers, bringing it one step closer to its target.\n\nSubscribers will receive regular email updates on the project\u2019s progress. Once the one-million email subscription goal is reached, the team will send out a single email announcing the launch of the ERC-20 token. The project is attempting something that has not been achieved on a global scale before.\n\nTo ensure the validity of the project\u2019s one million email subscription goal, the team will send out a verification email to confirm that all users added are genuine. The team has not revealed their identities and will not be providing tokenomics about the crypto coin.\n\nBitcoin: A Strong Investment Choice\n\nBitcoin is currently the largest cryptocurrency on the market, and more and more establishments are starting to accept it as a payment method. In Paris, Burger King has introduced power bank rental machines called Instpower, which accept crypto payments such as BTC. These machines are connected to Binance Pay and Alchemy Pay.\n\nThis move by Burger King in Paris is part of a larger trend of companies embracing cryptocurrency payments, highlighting the growing acceptance and legitimacy of digital currencies. With the rise of crypto and the growing demand for alternative payment methods, more businesses will likely start accepting cryptocurrency payments in the near future.\n\nEthereum Holders Await Price Rally\n\nMany Ethereum holders are eagerly anticipating a price rally, as suggested by crypto analyst Justin Bennett. Bennett speculates that Ethereum may face a rally that could liquidate traders facing bearish action on ETH\u2019s platform. The rally at the end of March could hint at the crypto market\u2019s short-term performance.\n\nWhile the crypto market is typically affected by stock market trends, there is often a lag between the two asset classes. If the crypto market takes cues from equities, a resistance level at $1,840 for Ethereum is possible. Therefore, a short squeeze could occur, triggering rallies, as there is a considerable amount of short liquidations over the $2,000 price level.\n\nEmbracing the Future of Finance with Crypto Coins\n\nAs Paris embraces cryptocurrency and recognizes its benefits and potential as an alternative to traditional forms of currency, it may inspire other countries to follow suit. While crypto investments do carry risks due to economic conditions and market volatility, accepting crypto as part of the future of finance can help everyone adapt to the changing landscape of the digital economy.\n\nSignuptoken.com could become the next major crypto coin to launch on an exchange. Learn more about this unique crypto project and sign up to reap the early benefits when the coin launches.\n\nVisit Signuptoken.com today:\n\nWebsite: https://www.signuptoken.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_SignUpToken_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/SignUpToken\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "MUMBAI: Promising to double money in Bitcoin investments within 45 minutes, unidentified cyber fraudsters duped a 27-year-old woman of Rs 3.88 lakh. The victim, who earlier worked with a share trading firm, lodged an FIR with the LT Marg police on April 5.The complainant had recently quit her job and was at home. She came across an advertisement on Telegram about the Bitcoin money doubling investment scheme.She had seen such messages earlier too, but this time, she opened a link given in the message link and found a mobile number in it. The woman called on the number and the call receiver said he was from a Bitcoin company and explained the investment scheme to the woman, convincing her to invest in it saying her investment will be doubled in 45 minutes. The fraudster collected the complainant's bank account details where he said they would be sending her profit.\"The complainant initially invested Rs 7,000. She was told that it will be doubled within 45 minutes. However, even after two to three hours when the profit was not deposited to her account, she contacted the person and asked him about it. The accused told her that she had gained double profit and asked her to pay income tax fees, GST, legal fees etc,\" said an officer. The accused told her that by the time she sends the legal fees and other charges, they would have further invested her profit to double it. The accused communicated via WhatsApp messages and calls.Police said between March 14 and March 20, the woman sent Rs 3.88 lakh in eight Indian bank accounts provided by the cyber fraudster through more than a dozen transactions. \"The woman kept asking for her money but the accused would tell her to send more money as fees saying her investment in Bitcoin was increasing. However, after March 20, the accused stopped taking her calls,\" said police. This is when she realised she was duped. A team led by senior PI Jyoti Desai and comprising API Prakash Patil and head constable Santosh Paware is probing the case."
