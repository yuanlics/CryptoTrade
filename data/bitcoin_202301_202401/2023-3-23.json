        "content": "VR Test\n\nTable 2 shows the VR test results for the daily log Bitcoin price series. The random walk hypothesis is partially rejected under the homoscedasticity assumption. Specifically, there is mixed evidence: the log of Bitcoin\u2019s price series follows the EMH in the long-run (\\(\\mathrm{VR}(q)\\approx 1\\)) in line with previous literature12,44,45, while it appears to have a mean-reverting property (\\(\\mathrm{VR}\\left(q\\right)<1\\)) in the short-run which is consistent with Corbet and Katsiampa46.\n\nTable 2 VR test results on the log price series of Bitcoin. Variance ratios for holding periods 2, 4, 8, and 16 are tested under the homoscedasticity assumption. ** and *** indicate significance at the 1% and 0.1% levels, respectively. Full size table\n\nTo ensure the adequacy of the VR test, it must hold that the innovations of log price series, that is, the log return series, are Gaussian white noise. However, several previous studies have shown that power law emerges in the tail distribution of Bitcoin\u2019s return series47,48,49,50. Accordingly, we conduct normality tests on the residuals of random walk specification. Table 3 indicates that the null hypothesis, the innovations of the log price series are normally distributed, is rejected at the 1% significance level for the two test statistics such as Jarque\u2013Bera and Shapiro\u2013Wilk tests regardless of sampling intervals. This indicates that the VR test is limited, requiring another approach.\n\nTable 3 Normality test results on the log return distribution of Bitcoin. Jarque\u2013Bera test is run by \\({\\chi }^{2}\\) statistic, and Shapiro\u2013Wilk test is by \\(W\\) statistic. The cutoff values for \\(W\\) are calculated through Monte-Carlo simulations. *** indicates significance at the 0.1% level. The sampling interval q is applied differently to the same data. Full size table\n\nQHO\n\nBefore testing the market efficiency through the QHO, we investigate whether the QHO clearly explains the log return distribution of Bitcoin. Here, we divide the overall sample period into two sub-periods, i.e., low and high price regimes, as the dynamics of Bitcoin price appear differently due to the significant difference in its price level51. The low price regime extends from September 1, 2010, to February 26, 2013, and the high price regime spans from February 27, 2013, to March 31, 2019. Figures 1 (a) and (c) show the histograms of log returns in the Bitcoin market and the PDFs estimated from (i) the QHO and (ii) the random walk model (RWM) in the two regimes. Figures 1 (b) and (d) display the quantile\u2013quantile (Q\u2013Q) plots for the residuals of each model. The PDFs estimated by the QHO fit well, while those by the RWM significantly underestimate the data at the zone near zero, regardless of the price regimes. This is confirmed through two goodness of fit tests, i.e., Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov and Cramer-von Mises tests (Table 4). Moreover, the likelihood-ratio (LR) test compares the goodness of fit of two competing models based on the ratio of their likelihoods and further elaborates that the QHO describes the data better (Table 5).\n\nFigure 1 Model estimation results. Panels (a) and (c) plot the PDFs of each estimated model in the low and high price regimes, respectively. Panels (b) and (d) describe Q\u2013Q plots for the residuals of each model by standardized normal order, plotted with a regression line, in both regimes. Both models are estimated using a daily sampling interval (q = 1). Outliers that deviate from the mean by more than \\(2.58\\times \\mathrm{Std}.\\mathrm{ Err}.\\) are excluded. Full size image\n\nTable 4 The goodness of fit test results on the log return distributions of Bitcoin derived from QHO and RWM. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test is run by \\(D\\) and Cramer-von Mises test is by \\(T\\) statistics. The cutoff values for \\(T\\) statistics are calculated through Monte-Carlo simulations. In the test, outliers that deviate from the mean by more than \\(2.58\\times \\mathrm{Std}.\\mathrm{ Err}.\\) are excluded. The numbers in parentheses are p-values of the statistics, where *** represents significance at the 0.1% level. Full size table\n\nTable 5 LR test results. The LR test assesses the adequacy of the QHO model over RWM where outliers that deviate from the mean by more than \\(2.58\\times \\mathrm{Std}.\\mathrm{ Err}.\\) are excluded. The result indicates that the QHO (unrestricted) model explains the data better than the RWM (restricted) model. The formula of the LR test statistic is \\(LR=-2\\mathrm{log}({L}_{r}/{L}_{u})\\) , where \\({L}_{u}\\) and \\({L}_{r}\\) denote the likelihood of the respective models such as QHO and RWM. The test statistic follows \\({\\chi }^{2}\\) distribution with the degree of freedom (d.f.) 3, which refers to the number of constrained parameters. The p-value indicates that the unrestricted model outperforms the restricted model. Full size table\n\nIn Table 6, the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) show that the PDFs derived from the QHO (mixture \\(\\chi\\) distribution) have smaller errors than those from the RWM (Gaussian distribution) in both price regimes. This is because the solution of the QHO is a generalized solution of the RWM, capturing both Gaussian and non-Gaussian features together. Particularly, the QHO includes market uncertainty through the properties of superimposed wave functions and assumes that the resilience of the harmonic oscillator reflects the restoring force that drives market return to the long-run equilibrium26: market friction is reflected in the stochastic differential equation.\n\nTable 6 Prediction errors of the log return distributions of Bitcoin derived from the QHO and RWM. Each estimated value is calculated based on the daily interval. Full size table\n\nTable 7 summarizes the estimated probabilities assigned to the first three low-lying eigenstates (\\(n=0, 1, 2)\\) for Bitcoin in both regimes as well as in the overall sample period (Those for the benchmarks in the overall sample period are shown in the supplementary information). Each eigenstate of the QHO model is described as a \\(\\chi\\) distribution, and the probability \\({P}_{n}\\) assigned to each represents a value of the probability assigned to each \\(\\chi\\) distribution26. The state of \\(n=3\\) and higher is neglected because the values assigned to \\({P}_{n}\\) are less than \\({10}^{-4}\\). The result is presented along with daily (\\(q=1\\)) and other different holding periods (\\(q=2, 4, 8, 16\\)). Particularly, since a market is efficient when the log return distribution is close to the Gaussian distribution, it can be said that the Bitcoin market follows the EMH based on the value of \\({P}_{0}\\): that is, the probability allocation in the Gaussian distribution that describes the ground state of the QHO model. Unlike the mixed evidence of the VR test, the result of QHO consistently supports the efficiency of the Bitcoin market: the log of Bitcoin price follows a random walk with a probability of 90% or more.\n\nTable 7 Probability assigned to each eigenstate in the Bitcoin market. The holding period ( \\(q\\) ) reflects the \\(q\\) th difference of the log price data as \\({x}_{t}=252.5/q \\left(\\mathrm{ln}{p}_{t}-\\mathrm{ln}{p}_{t-q}\\right).\\) Full size table\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur results are explained through market capitalization and the speed of information discovery. Table 8 shows that the \\(m\\omega\\) value of Bitcoin is much smaller with the scale being about 1/19 to 1/47 than that of other assets (e.g., commodity, stock, and currency). According to Ahn et al.26, \\(m\\) can be interpreted as the market capitalization and \\(\\omega\\) as the angular velocity for log return fluctuations. The average market capitalization (\\(m\\)) of Bitcoin in 2010\u20132019 is about 1/321 and 1/648 of the gold and S&P 500, respectively. Thus, the oscillating velocity around the equilibrium (\\(\\omega\\)) for Bitcoin is estimated about 17 and 25 times larger than those for the gold and S&P 500, respectively. It implies that information circulation in the Bitcoin market is sufficiently fast compared to others, confirming the efficiency of the Bitcoin market together with the probability assigned to the ground state.\n\nTable 8 Market capitalization and the speed of information discovery. The \\(m\\omega\\) values are estimated through the QHO model. Market capitalization represents the average daily market capitalization during the sample period. The daily market capitalization of Bitcoin and S&P 500 is retrieved from Quandl.com and the Center for Research in Security Prices, respectively. The daily market capitalization of gold is estimated by multiplying daily gold prices with the yearly above-ground gold reserves provided by World Gold Council. As the definition of market capitalization of USD/EUR is ambiguous, we have not directly made a comparison with the \\(\\omega\\) of USD/EUR. The period of data collection was from September 10, 2010, to March 31, 2019. To match the sample period of Bitcoin and that of the other assets, we extract daily data excluding the holidays for Bitcoin. Full size table\n\nWe estimate the probability assigned to the first three low-lying eigenstates for each year. Figure 2 shows that the yearly \\({P}_{0}\\) value fluctuates over the 90% level. This further confirms the robustness of our results: there is no significant change in the pattern of probability allocation at the ground state by year. This implies that technical analysis of historical price series cannot provide a long-term advantage in the Bitcoin market; future price evolution will be based on new information rather than past price performance. However, the \\({P}_{0}\\) values in 2013 and 2017 fell to around 88% and 87%, respectively. On the one hand, the decrease in 2013 is regarded as the transition period, shifting the Bitcoin market from a low to a high price regime51. The Bitcoin price, which had been in the tens of US dollars, exceeded USD 1,000 per BTC and burst a market bubble52: in December 2013, the Bitcoin price surged to USD 1,147 per BTC, then plunged by up to 85% in the following year. Moreover, in 2013, Bitcoin production (mined volume) drastically decreased due to increased mining difficulty. This significantly affected the price of Bitcoin on the supply side53. Put differently, during the transition period of the price regime, the strong collective phenomenon together with supply shortage resulted in a decline in the efficiency of the Bitcoin market; the \\({P}_{0}\\) value supports these arguments well.\n\nFigure 2 Yearly change of the probability allocation in each eigenstate in the Bitcoin market. The black dashed line shows the probability assigned to the ground state (\\({P}_{0}\\)) while the blue dash-single dotted line and red dotted line describe the probabilities assigned to the first (\\({P}_{1}\\)) and second excited state (\\({P}_{2}\\)), respectively. Two shaded areas indicate the periods when \\({P}_{0}\\) value is estimated below 0.9. Full size image\n\nHowever, in 2017, there was a large increase of public interest in cryptocurrencies, which caused higher levels of uncertainty and induced herding behavior in cryptocurrency markets54. Bouri et al.55 statistically confirmed this by showing that significant herding frequently occurred in 2017 in cryptocurrency markets. Accordingly, in line with Froot et al.56, the decreased \\({P}_{0}\\) value in 2017 can be explained as follows: many short-term speculators who are new to cryptocurrency herd in the Bitcoin market based on information completely irrelevant to fundamentals. Meanwhile, this increase in irrational speculation was mainly derived from China\u2019s cryptocurrency exchange market which at that time accounted for more than 90% of the global cryptocurrency trading volume. Accordingly, the People\u2019s Bank of China banned domestic cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings in September 2017, followed by a drastic cryptocurrency price drop and resurgence a few days after57. Nonetheless, after these strict regulations were imposed, most of the trading volume of cryptocurrencies in China moved elsewhere (e.g., U.S., Japan, and South Korea) and their impact on cryptocurrency prices was ambiguous58. This implies that such strict regulations in cryptocurrencies would not be effective but just increase price uncertainty, affecting their market efficiency, which can also explain the low \\({P}_{0}\\) value in 2017.\n\nLiquidity increments in the Bitcoin market positively affect market efficiency; particularly, liquidity change plays a central role in the return predictability and, thus, informational efficiency of cryptocurrencies16,18. Generally, liquidity increase improves market efficiency through two channels59,60: first, it enables faster and cheaper transactions, thereby price promptly absorbs available information in the marketplace; second, it encourages investors to easily make tiny- or short-term massive transactions based on private information that barely impacts prices, approximating the market prices to fundamental asset value61,62,63. Therefore, we examine the Amihud illiquidity ratio64 and explain the market efficiency of Bitcoin with the changes in liquidity: Fig. 3 shows that the Bitcoin market\u2019s liquidity keeps increasing gradually, even surpassing the USD/EUR and gold since 2014.\n\nFigure 3 Amihud illiquidity of the Bitcoin, gold, S&P 500, and USD/EUR markets. Following Amihud 63, the monthly illiquidity is estimated using the daily history of trades. The smaller the calculated illiquidity value, the greater the liquidity of the market. The red, yellow, blue, and green lines indicate Amihud illiquidity of the Bitcoin, gold, S&P 500, and USD/EUR markets, respectively. Each colored line is expressed on a log scale for comparison purposes, using data available from September 2010 to March 2019. The shaded area indicates the period of the low-price regime. The trading volume for each asset were retrieved from the following websites: https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets (Bitcoin), https://backtestmarket.com (gold), https://finance.yahoo.com (S&P 500), and https://www.fxcm.com/markets (USD/EUR). Full size image\n\nUnlike other assets, Bitcoin has a unique market structure where inelastic supply meets elastic demand since the total issuance (mining volume) is predetermined. Therefore, investors\u2019 reaction to market information has a huge impact on Bitcoin prices. Additionally, year-round 24/7 trading, relatively low transaction costs, and low entry barriers to the market help investors participate freely and make decisions promptly, ultimately facilitating quick information dissemination in the market price. This explains how the Bitcoin market was able to operate close to an efficient market even with a low liquidity level in the early stage, especially during the low price regime in 2010\u20132012. However, since 2013, the market has stabilized with the birth of multiple exchanges and institutional investors\u2019 interests. Accordingly, the liquidity of the Bitcoin market continued to expand, which has further contributed to market efficiency in the high price regime. Thus, negative factors that inhibit the efficient dissemination of information in the market, such as instability of the initial market system, early government regulations, externalities like hacking, and highly speculative transactions, appear to be offset by the development of the Bitcoin market."

The skull is made with electronic waste donated by Unirecycle, representing the millions of computers used to validate Bitcoin transactions, known as mining.\n\nThe Skull of Satoshi symbolizes the enormous climate impact of bitcoin mining and serves as an avatar to encourage financial institutions to take responsibility for the climate impact of Bitcoin investments, products, and services they offer.\n\nGreenpeace Campaigner Rolf Skar said: \u201cCoal-fired power plants are being revived and kept alive by the growing electricity demands of Bitcoin mining. This is a horrifying development, given the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels to prevent a climate catastrophe. Our skull design serves as a powerful symbol, urging financial institutions to use their influence to advocate for a code change that could reduce Bitcoin\u2019s electricity usage by a whopping 99%. We cannot afford to expand our reliance on fossil fuels any further, and it\u2019s up to the Bitcoin community to take action and change their code \u2013 not the climate \u2013 if we hope to secure a sustainable future for all.\u201d\n\nFinancial companies like Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and Blackrock that have climate goals and invest in Bitcoin and offer Bitcoin products can use their influence to call for a code change to create a more energy efficient consensus mechanism.\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions rivaling that of countries like Ireland and Chile, Greenpeace and Von Wong are calling on the companies to push Bitcoin to change its code to one that isn\u2019t electricity-intensive, greatly reducing its climate pollution and environmental impact on local communities living near mining facilities.\n\nArtist Benjamin Von Wong said: \u201cAs an artist and activist, I believe in the power of art to spark conversations and inspire change. The idea that we have the unique opportunity to erase the climate footprint equivalent of an entire country by fixing Bitcoin is so exciting to me.\n\n\u201cThe crypto community has some of the brightest minds, and I have no doubt that if we can generate enough demand for a more sustainable Bitcoin that some genius can come up with a solution that works for all people and the planet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to see what Greenpeace does with this art installation and to play a small part in the global transformation necessary!\u201d\n\nWatch the making of the Skull of Satoshi to see the artistic process behind this powerful installation and learn more about the environmental impact of bitcoin mining.\n\nSkull of Satoshi Arrives in New York City\n\nNext week, Greenpeace will be taking the Skull of Satoshi on an accountability tour, bringing attention to financial institutions that are investing heavily into Bitcoin. The tour seeks to spark a conversation and encourage the financial industry to encourage Bitcoin to change the code, not the climate. The first stop will be New York City.\n\nFor more information on the upcoming action in New York City, email [email protected].\n\nAdditional information and content\n\nChange the Code website: https://cleanupbitcoin.com/\n\nLink to Von Wong\u2019s Blog: https://blog.vonwong.com/skull/\n\nLink to Von Wong\u2019s Video: https://youtu.be/SAYr_ZB-98o\n\nLink to Photos and Videos for press: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rn7ju8v0eosrbzl/AABLoseAodmvNQ5u6hD6kGKBa?dl=0\n\n###\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Greenpeace USA Senior Communications Specialist, [email protected], 631-404-9977\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.

        "content": "The exchange giant is joining Fidelity and BNY Mellon in the pursuit of their own cryptocurrency custody platform.\n\nNasdaq, an American stock exchange based in New York City, is reportedly looking at Q2 2023 for the release of its custody services for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Senior Vice President and Head of Nasdaq Digital Assets Ira Auerbach said that Nasdaq \u201cis pushing ahead to get all the necessary technical infrastructure and regulatory approvals in place.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe report describes an infrastructure that might look similar to that of Fidelity Digital Assets, which quietly opened its operations to the public last week. The first step to bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading on Nasdaq would be the custody service for the assets.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg report, \u201cNasdaq has applied to the New York Department of Financial Services for a limited-purpose trust company charter, which would oversee the new business.\u201d\n\n\n\nLaunching just as several major cryptocurrency firms have collapsed, amidst increasing regulatory tension, the goal is seemingly to offer those customers who now have no platform, a regulated, well-trusted American service for bitcoin.\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that many of the issues surrounding exchanges come from the third-party risks presented by a custodian holding bitcoin for customers. The most secure way to interact with bitcoin is to self-custody it with your own wallet. Although trading platforms do offer the ease of interaction created by custodianship, with the American financial system seeing precarious headlines as of late, it is important to consider these trade offs compared with traditional bitcoin self-custody.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Former Coinbase Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Balaji Srinivasan is betting big on Bitcoin (BTC/USD), predicting the cryptocurrency will hit $1 million by June 17 because of a rapid devaluation of the U.S. dollar.\n\nSrinivasan entered into a $1 million bet via Twitter with two individuals, offering up Circle's USDC stablecoin to pseudonymous Twitter personality James Medlock and another unnamed person if Bitcoin fails to achieve the historic gains he predicts. The bet is part of Srinivasan\u2019s view that the global economy is on the cusp of change, leading to what he calls \"hyperbitcoinization\" and a redenomination of the global economy on Bitcoin as digital gold.\n\nSrinivasan's prediction comes amid a series of bank failures in the U.S. that have injected fear and uncertainty into financial markets. Bitcoin's recent surge past $28,000, outperforming Wall Street bank stocks, has led some on Twitter to call it \"The Great Decoupling.\" The bold bet has sparked lively debates on Twitter, with prominent voices, including Jimmy Song and Adam Cochran, weighing in on its feasibility.\n\nOther startups in the sector have seen increased traction following the blockchain-based rebound. Popular blockchain-based gaming asset platform Gameflip, for example, recently passed $870,000 raised on StartEngine and $160 million in volume traded on the platform.\n\nAlthough Cochran acknowledged that Bitcoin could have utility during an existential crisis for the financial system, he argued that Srinivasan's bet is fueled by an unrealistic hope in a risky macro environment. Cochran posited that a collapse of the U.S. and European banking systems would ultimately overshadow the potential value of Bitcoin as an asset, making bunkers or beans a better use of money than purchasing the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\nTo stay updated with top startup investments, sign up for Benzinga\u2019s Startup Investing & Equity Crowdfunding Newsletter\n\nSrinivasan's bet has sparked renewed excitement and hope in the crypto market after a tough 2022, a time when prices plummeted and numerous crypto firms collapsed.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing Srinivasan's bet on Bitcoin's rise to $1 million, Bloomberg's Matt Levine questioned why Srinivasan chose to make the bet instead of simply buying Bitcoin. In response to Levine's tweet, some suggested that Srinivasan may be attempting to manipulate the price of Bitcoin, while others posited that he may be seeking exposure for himself and the cryptocurrency. According to Datawallet, Srinivasan's estimated net worth is around $150 million. He previously co-founded Earn.com, which rewarded users with digital assets for completing small tasks, before it was acquired by Coinbase, where he served as CTO.\n\nOthers share Srinivasan's bold prediction that Bitcoin could reach $1 million in value. Last year, Ark Invest, led by Cathie Wood, also made a similar forecast, estimating that Bitcoin's value could surpass $1 million by 2030.\n\nWood\u2019s prediction was based on the assumption that Bitcoin would continue to gain acceptance among institutional investors, leading to an increase in demand and a subsequent rise in price. Ark Invest is a well-known investment firm that specializes in disruptive innovation, and Wood is one of the most prominent voices in the investment community advocating for Bitcoin.\n\nRead Next: The Tesla Of Lawn Mowers: Soon Your Cars Won't Be Your Only Self-Driving, All-Electric Vehicle\n\nWhile Srinivasan\u2019s prediction of a $1 million Bitcoin price within the next three months is more ambitious than Wood\u2019s, it is not without precedent. Bitcoin has experienced massive price swings in the past, with some investors making fortunes during bull markets. But the cryptocurrency has also been subject to extreme volatility, and it is not uncommon for its price to plummet just as quickly as it rises.\n\nRegardless of whether Srinivasan\u2019s bet pays off, it has generated a lot of attention in the cryptocurrency community. Many people are eager to see whether he will be proven right, and the outcome of his wager could have far-reaching implications for the future of Bitcoin and the wider crypto market.\n\nSee more on startup investing from Benzinga.\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

The movement closely tracked the traditional financial sector, particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index, which gained 2.1% as Bitcoin surpassed the $28,000 threshold.\n\nOn March 22, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25% but hinted that it is nearing its maximum level for 2023. In the end, however, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that it is too soon to determine the extent of the tighter credit conditions, so monetary policy will remain flexible.\n\nInitially, it appears encouraging that the central bank is less inclined to increase the cost of money. However, global economies are exhibiting signs of stress. For instance, consumer confidence in the euro area decreased by 19.2% in March, reversing five consecutive months of gains and defying economists\u2019 predictions of an improvement.\n\nThe recession is still putting pressure on companies\u2019 profits and leading to layoffs. For example, on March 23, professional services company Accenture said it would end the contracts of 19,000 workers over the next 18 months. On March 22, the company Indeed, which helps people find jobs, let go of 2,200 workers, or 15% of its staff.\n\nThe stronger the correlation to traditional markets, the less likely a decoupling. As a result, according to futures and margin markets, the Bitcoin price increase has not instilled much confidence in professional traders.\n\nBulls and bears exhibit a balanced demand on margin markets\n\nMargin trading allows investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their trading position, potentially increasing their returns. For example, one can buy Bitcoin by borrowing Tether (USDT), thus increasing their crypto exposure. On the other hand, borrowing Bitcoin can only be used to bet on a price decline.\n\nUnlike futures contracts, the balance between margin longs and shorts isn\u2019t necessarily matched. When the margin lending ratio is high, it indicates that the market is bullish. The opposite, a low lending ratio, signals that the market is bearish.\n\nOKX USDT/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nOn March 15, the margin markets longs-to-short indicator at the OKX exchange peaked at 60, but by March 17, it had fallen to 22. This indicates that during the rally, reckless leverage was not used. Historically, levels above 40 indicate a highly imbalanced demand favoring longs.\n\nThe indicator is currently at 19, indicating a balanced situation given the high cost of borrowing U.S. dollars (or stablecoins) to short BTC, which stands at 15%.\n\nLong-to-short data shows reduced demand for leverage longs\n\nThe top traders\u2019 long-to-short net ratio excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets. Analysts can better understand whether professional traders are leaning bullish or bearish by aggregating the positions on the spot, perpetual and quarterly futures contracts.\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so viewers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin likely to outperform all crypto assets following banking crisis, analyst explains\n\nExchange's top traders long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nBetween March 18 and March 22, the top traders\u2019 long-to-short ratio at OKX increased, peaking at 1.09, but reversed course on March 23. The indicator is currently at its lowest level in 11 days, at 0.76. Meanwhile, at the Huobi exchange, the top traders\u2019 long-to-short ratio has stood flat near 1.0 since March 18.\n\nLastly, Binance whales have consistently been reducing their leverage longs since March 17. More precisely, the ratio dropped from 1.36 to 1.09 on March 23, its lowest level in 11 days.\n\nAs Bitcoin has gained 13% since March 16, margin and futures markets indicate that whales and market makers were ill-prepared. This may initially appear bearish, but if the $28,000 support level holds, professional traders will likely be compelled to add long positions, further accelerating the bullish momentum.\n\nBitcoin derivatives ultimately exhibit no signs of stress. Not having excessive leverage on long positions is positive, and bears did not dare to add short positions. Nonetheless, recession risks and growing regulatory uncertainty, such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2018s Wells notice against the Coinbase exchange on March 22, will likely keep the price of Bitcoin below $30,000 for a while.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Attackers hit Bitcoin ATMs to steal $1.5 million in crypto cash - The Register",
        "content": "Unidentified miscreants have siphoned cryptocurrency valued at more than $1.5 million from Bitcoin ATMs by exploiting an unknown flaw in digicash delivery systems.\n\nAccording to General Bytes, the outfit that sold the ATMs and had managed some of them with a cloud service, the attackers used an interface designed to upload videos to instead inject a malicious Java application, and then subverted ATM user privileges.\n\nThey drained at least 56 Bitcoin \u2013 about $1.5 million as of publication time \u2013 from crypto wallets. General Bytes issued a patch 15 hours after discovering the intrusion, but by then the digital coins were gone, leaving an unknown number of victims on the hook for the lost money.\n\n\"The entire team has been working around the clock to collect all data regarding the security breach and is continuously working to resolve all cases to help clients back online and continue to operate their ATMs as soon as possible,\" General Bytes explained in a statement.\n\nGeneral Bytes notified companies that bought its ATMs to shut down their systems. The supplier, headquartered in Prague with a US office in Bradenton, Florida, sells and operates five different models of crypto ATM.\n\nPeople use them to exchange Bitcoin and other currencies. In all, General Bytes says it has sold more than 15,000 terminals in 149 countries supporting more than 180 currencies. The systems have performed more than 15.2 million transactions.\n\nThe attack\n\nBusinesses buying the ATMs connect them to a crypto application server (CAS) managed by the customer themselves or \u2013 until now \u2013 General Bytes through cloud service provider DigitalOcean.\n\nIn the breach over the weekend, the attackers exploited a vulnerability that had gone undetected despite multiple security audits since 2021. The baddies scanned DigitalOcean's IP address space and found Crypto Application Server (CAS) services on port 7741 \u2013 including General Bytes' cloud service and other customers running their ATMs on DigitalOcean.\n\n\"Using this security vulnerability, the attacker uploaded his application directly to the application server used by the admin interface,\" the chastened ATM vendor wrote. \"The application server was, by default, configured to start applications in its deployment folder.\"\n\nThe miscreants accessed the database, read and decrypted API keys and exchanges, and drained digital coins from wallets. They could also download usernames and password hashes, turn off multifactor authentication, access terminal event logs, and search for instances where users scanned private keys at the terminals.\n\nThis is the second such attack on General Bytes, which had digital coins stolen in August 2022 by miscreants exploiting a flaw in the CAS.\n\nThe problem with hot wallets\n\nHot wallets present a particular problem in the high-risk crypto market. Wallets would be safer if disconnected from the internet, but users rely on them for quick transactions, which calls for connectivity.\n\n\"The entire purpose of hot wallets is to provide an immediate ability to make transactions,\" John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at cybersecurity firm Netenrich, told The Register. \"That said, the security of any wallet is tied to the security of the private key. If someone gets that \u2013 which can be copied \u2013 it's game over. All the layers of protection against fraud don't and can't apply to crypto.\"\n\nGeneral Bytes said it is shutting down its cloud services, noting it is \"theoretically (and practically) impossible to secure a system granting access to multiple operators at the same time where some of them are bad actors.\"\n\nAll customers now will manage their own terminals using their own servers. General Bytes will help businesses migrate their data from the cloud to their standalone servers. It's also urging customers to keep their CAS behind a firewall and VPN to prevent other attackers getting into them through the internet.\n\nThey also should assume all their users' passwords and API keys to exchanges and hot wallets are compromised.\n\nThe Register has asked General Bytes for further comment and will update if more information comes in.\n\nCrypto theft is a big business that is only growing bigger. According to blockchain biz Chainalysis, $3.8 billion in digital coins were stolen in 2022, compared with $500 million two years earlier. Mike Parkin, senior technical evangelist at risk remediation vendor Vulcan Cyber, said there is only one way to really reduce the risk that comes with cryptocurrency: Get out of it altogether.\n\n\"It may not be the answer people want to hear, but crypto is still immature, volatile, unregulated, and subject to new and creative cyber criminal attacks,\" Parkin told The Register. \"Do you really want your money in this space?\" \u00ae"

        "title": "How to Handle Bitcoin Dust - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Bitcoin dust is like loose change. A few pennies in the couch cushions won\u2019t grab your attention, but you\u2019ll eventually collect too many to ignore. As with picking up pennies, cleaning up bitcoin dust is a way to reorganize assets. Unlike cents in the couch cushions, however, bitcoin dust can have ramifications for privacy and security.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Dust?\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol has no notion of a net balance in an address. Instead, the Bitcoin ledger is a collection of indivisible bits of \u201cunspent\u201d bitcoin (BTC) called unspent transaction output (UTXO) locked to wallet addresses. So, in your single Bitcoin wallet, you might have a balance of 1 BTC. In actuality, however, it\u2019s comprised of multiple UTXOs, such as:\n\n0.553 BTC\n\n0.238 BTC\n\n0.209 BTC\n\nIf you wanted to spend 0.5 BTC, you would pull from the top UTXO (or your wallet would automatically do this), leaving you with 0.053 BTC in change. If you used that UTXO to send 0.05 BTC, you\u2019d be left with 0.003 BTC. Once that pile of bitcoin dwindles to a number smaller than the transaction fee, it\u2019s dust \u2014 you can\u2019t spend it.\n\nOther Problems\n\nDust isn\u2019t merely caused by transactions you know are coming into and out of your account. When you send 0.5 BTC to a friend or get 0.01 BTC as a tip, that\u2019s one thing. But some people might purposely send a much smaller amount of bitcoin to you and thousands of others. This is known as a \u201cdusting attack\u201d or just \u201cdusting.\u201d\n\nSometimes it\u2019s criminals doing the dusting. They might target anonymous whales as part of an effort to discover their identity, lure them into a phishing scam, or extort them. Law enforcement agencies might dust to find links between wallets suspected of criminal activity. Blockchain analytics firms (e.g., Chainalysis) might dust to better map connections between Bitcoin addresses. Lastly, spammers and advertisers can use dust to attach messages that will arrive in your wallet.\n\nWhile receiving some spare change might seem innocuous, it does present a few issues. First, dust can enable denial-of-service attacks, where the network is flooded with microtransactions to slow it down, manipulate fees, or even crash wallets. However, dusting attacks have become less popular as transaction fees have risen.\n\nMost importantly, bitcoin dust threatens individuals\u2019 privacy. When you consolidate dust from multiple addresses into one, you generally create a link between them that scammers might use to trace someone\u2019s identity and spending patterns.\n\n5 Methods for Getting Rid of Bitcoin Dust\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do anything with your dust. But if you find it untidy or would just like to free up some funds, you have some options (below). We\u2019ve noted the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n\n1. Use a Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet\n\nA hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet uses a single master seed to generate a tree-like structure of new keys with a deterministic algorithm for every transaction. As a result, HD wallets automatically consolidate small UTXOs across multiple wallets into a single larger one. This reduces the number of UTXOs, in turn lowering transaction fees and improving network efficiency. Use HD wallets cautiously, however, as losing the master key can compromise the hierarchy. They also prioritize ease of use over privacy, so consolidation can create links between the wallets; blockchain sleuths can use these links to trace an address to its owner. Ledger, Trezor, and Mycelium are popular HD wallet providers.\n\n2. Use an Exchange to Convert Dust\n\nSome exchanges, like Binance and KuCoin, support the trading of bitcoin dust. The reasonably simple process involves depositing your dust into your exchange account using the provided public Bitcoin address. You can then use bitcoin dust to trade. Some exchanges also feature a dust-conversion tool that exchanges the dust for the exchange\u2019s native token, such as BNB on Binance. One evident downside is privacy \u2014 centralized exchanges generally demand customers provide identifying \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d information before using their services.\n\n3. Dust Off\n\n\u201cDusting off\u201d is the process of adding a small amount of bitcoin to the dust address to make it usable again. You may use an exchange or other Bitcoin wallets for this. Ensure that you add sufficient bitcoin to cover fees when dusting off. Dusting off preserves privacy but incurs transaction fees at multiple steps.\n\n4. Raise Your Dust Limit\n\nThe dust limit of a Bitcoin wallet defines the minimum amount of bitcoin the network can allow in a transaction. This limit fluctuates with network fees. Raising the limit means you are prevented from sending low-value UTXOs, which typically create dust. This method is good for users with surplus bitcoin, as you might need to combine multiple UTXOs to meet your dust limit.\n\n5. Use a VPN\n\nA virtual private network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a remote server, making it difficult for attackers to trace your on-chain activity with other identifiable information. While a VPN can take the sting out of a dusting attack, it\u2019s not a foolproof solution. VPNs are good for privacy in general; use them with other methods mentioned above to add another layer of security.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nBitcoin dust may seem trivial to some users. Thankfully, there are several simple ways to eliminate dust. We encourage you to try some of the methods in this guide to find what works best for you."

        "content": "Greenpeace USA and Artist Benjamin Von Wong Join Forces to Highlight Bitcoin\u2019s Climate Problem\n\nArt and activism merge in the striking art installation called the Skull of Satoshi, created by art activist Benjamin Von Wong and Greenpeace USA to highlight Bitcoin\u2019s record of climate destruction.\n\nThe world of Bitcoin might seem intangible, but the reality is that Bitcoin has a very tangible impact on our climate, environment, and communities. We\u2019re in a climate crisis, and right now Bitcoin is part of the problem\u2013but it doesn\u2019t have to be. That is why Greenpeace has teamed up with artist and activist Benjamin Von Wong. Greenpeace campaigner Rolf Skar first met Von Wong while studying the impacts of climate change on the Greenland Ice Sheet. It was there that Skar and Von Wong began talking about Bitcoin\u2019s climate impact and what could be done to address it. Realizing that most people didn\u2019t understand the connection between Bitcoin and the Climate Crisis \u2013 Von Wong and Skar embarked on a creative collaboration to design a visual symbol that could grab attention and support Greenpeace\u2019s campaign to change the code, not the climate. The result is an 11-foot skull covered in E-Waste, complete with Bitcoin Laser Eyes, titled: \u201cThe Skull of Satoshi\u201d.\n\nWhy is Greenpeace calling for Bitcoin to change the code? Because Bitcoin \u201cmining\u201d is causing needless harm to communities and our climate. Bitcoin is the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency and relies on a validation system called Proof of Work (PoW) that uses massive amounts of electricity mostly from climate polluting fossil fuels like coal and gas. In one year, Bitcoin uses as much electricity as the Netherlands and emits over 63 million metric tons of GHG emissions, more than Hungary emits annually.\n\nGreenpeace\u2019s ask to the Bitcoin community is straight-forward: change the code, not the climate. Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, changed to a much more energy-efficient Proof of Stake (PoS) code in September 2022. After changing to a PoS, Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption decreased by 99.95%.\n\nSince Bitcoin is decentralized and has no formal leadership, it is incumbent on those investing in Bitcoin to join the movement to change Bitcoin\u2019s code. That is why we are looking to financial institutions that have large Bitcoin businesses like Fidelity, Blackrock, and Goldman Sachs to stand true to their climate commitments and use their influence to help change Bitcoin\u2019s code, not the climate.\n\nWhy art? Art can be a powerful tool for raising awareness and inspiring action. It has the ability to engage people emotionally, intellectually, and visually in ways that traditional forms of communication may not. This is particularly important with complex issues like the intersection of climate and cryptocurrency.\n\nWe hope that the Skull of Satoshi will be an invitation for people to join the campaign and learn more about Bitcoin and its role in stoking the flames of the climate crisis.\n\nHow does art become activism? Greenpeace will use the Skull of Satoshi as a visual reminder to Bitcoin\u2019s backers in the financial services industry that Bitcoin is damaging communities and our climate. We will demand that financial institutions uphold their climate commitments and ask Bitcoin to change its code. The first stop is New York City, where the Skull of Satoshi and Greenpeace USA will call on financial institutions to recognize their responsibility and help make change.\n\nYou can also join our campaign to stop Bitcoin from fueling the climate crisis by claiming a free Change The Code sticker right now!\n\nMeet the artists behind the Skull of Satoshi and learn how they became involved in Greenpeace\u2019s Change the Code campaign\n\nBenjamin Von Wong is a Canadian artist and activist who uses his talents to raise awareness about social and environmental issues. He is best known for creating large-scale art installations that highlight environmental degradation caused by plastic pollution and electronic waste.\n\nVon Wong\u2019s art has been featured in numerous exhibitions and publications around the world, and has generated over 100M views for different causes through his hyper-realistic photographs and art installations.\n\nThrough his art and activism, Von Wong inspires positive change and encourages individuals and organizations to take responsibility for the impact of their actions on the environment and society. His collaboration with Greenpeace USA on the Skull of Satoshi is just one example of how he affects change through art.\n\n\u201cHow often do we get the opportunity to erase the climate footprint of an entire country?\u201d said Benjamin Von Wong. \u201cI\u2019m honored that Greenpeace agreed to collaborate and excited that my art can help to create demand for a more sustainable Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace USA is grateful for its partnership with Von Wong and the many volunteers who brought this project to life. Their commitment to climate activism is inspiring, and we hope that the skull will serve as a catalyst for change and inspire others to take action to protect the planet.\n\nJoin our campaign to stop Bitcoin from fueling the climate crisis by claiming a free Change The Code, Not the Climate sticker right now!"

        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nIn the wake of the largest international bank collapses since the 2008 financial crisis, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that Bitcoin\u2019s trustless and decentralized nature was created as an antidote to the increasingly unstable banking system, and that these same principles will prove to be an antidote today.\n\nThe first quarter of 2023 has seen a contagious spread of bank collapses, similar to the cascading failures of crypto businesses after FTX\u2019s failure in 2022. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), an essential component of the burgeoning U.S. tech industry, blossomed to manage billions of dollars as it provided essential liquidity for a variety of tech startups. However, since the COVID-19 pandemic, much of the free-flowing investment capital and low interest rates of the 2010s vanished entirely. Anxiety over a downturn in the tech industry mixed with social media panic to create a bank run that brought the place to its knees, and it wasn\u2019t alone. Signature Bank, in New York City, shuttered two days later and days later the Swiss bank Credit Suisse suffered a similar fate.\n\nThese rapid events have been accompanied by a dramatic rise in the valuation of bitcoin, with BTC rising from around $20,000 to $28,000 in a matter of days following the banking crisis. Although Bitcoin has been on a slow and steady recovery since the fallout of the FTX debacle, this represents the strongest jump bitcoin has seen since then. What\u2019s even more impressive is the remarkable way that this boom for bitcoin has come amid a general downturn for the rest of the crypto industry, marked by Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC) losing its peg with the dollar and the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) suggesting many crypto assets could come under more regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThen, the fall of Credit Suisse brought a new dynamic to these bank failures, transforming it into a global concern. The global financial industry spent a decade growing cozy around an infrastructure of easy capital and nonexistent interest rates, and both of those things have now apparently been destroyed. Even if the largest banks have yet to fail, the same economic conditions of failure are everywhere. Many of the most painful lessons of the 2008 collapse have slowly been forgotten, but Bitcoin remembers. As the global economic system moves towards deeper and deeper anxiety, it\u2019s important to remember why so many people bet on bitcoin.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Bitcoin\u2019s US$537 billion market cap accounted for 46.3% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$216 billion accounted for 18.6%.\n\nBanks vs Bitcoin\n\n\u201cThe past several months have seen efforts by officials to cut liquidity from the crypto ecosystem, underscoring why Bitcoin matters and how desperate central planners are to keep the fiat credit system from imploding,\u201d wrote Coutts.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoutts was referring to recent black swan events like the liquidation of crypto-focused bank Silvergate, which provided lending services for large crypto companies like Coinbase and Crypto.com.\n\nTwo other crypto-friendly banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, also closed operations in the same week, resulting in market concern that crypto exchanges and companies could go unbanked.\n\nFormer congressman and Signature Bank board member Barney Frank told CNBC on March 13 that the bank\u2019s closure meant that \u201cregulators wanted to send a very strong anti-crypto message.\u201d\n\nThe New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) said the following day that Signature\u2019s closure had nothing to do with crypto and that the decision was \u201cbased on the current status of the bank and its ability to do business in a safe and sound manner.\u201d\n\nCoutts disagreed with the regulator, saying that Signature\u2019s shutdown was a deliberate message for the crypto industry.\n\n\u201cThe bank [Signature Bank] was still meeting withdrawal requests, and [the bank\u2019s] board member Barney Frank said regulators \u2018wanted to send a message to get people away from crypto,'\u201d wrote Coutts.\n\n\u201cThe statement by Frank marries with the data,\u201d added Coutts. \u201cBased on the last reported numbers, unrealized losses from held-to-maturity assets for Signature Bank were 27.4% of book value, below the average for the S&P 500 banks industry group at 36.6%.\u201d\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, said that Bitcoin has always performed well during tumultuous times.\n\n\u201cIt would have been reasonable to assume Bitcoin might behave similarly when three crypto-facing banks \u2013 Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank \u2013 collapsed one after another,\u201d he said. Instead of a sharp decline in price, Bitcoin slipped and began to rise. \u201cIf people can\u2019t trust banks, Bitcoin would be a beneficiary.\u201d\n\n\u201cInvestors are scrambling to find safe havens. Gold increased to US$2,000 per ounce. We\u2019ve also seen the world choose Bitcoin as a safe haven,\u201d added Stadelmann.\n\nJonas Betz, a Germany-based crypto analyst, said that Bitcoin was created to hedge against a failing banking system but warned that the closure of crypto banks may lead to a liquidity shortage.\n\n\u201cThe recent closure of operations by Silvergate and Signature has resulted in a significant reduction in liquidity in the crypto markets. These banks provided systems (SEN and Signet) that were important for facilitating the entry of fiat currency into the crypto market. With limited options available, the industry is likely to face a liquidity crunch until new banks step in. This leads to increased volatility in crypto prices,\u201d wrote Betz.\n\nSee related article: Centralized intermediaries were cause of crypto failures in 2022, says Voorhees\n\nBiggest gainers: MASK & FLR\n\nMASK, the governance token of Mask Network, a mobile app and browser extension that aims to bridge Web 2.0 with Web 3.0, was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. The MASK token rose 35.43% to US$6.13 and started picking up momentum on Thursday, after it was listed on CoinMarketCap.\n\nFLR, the utility token of interoperability-focused layer-1 blockchain Flare Network, was the week\u2019s second-biggest gainer in the top 100, rising 15.42% to US$$0.03327. The token started gaining momentum on March 17, after Flare announced the first of 36 monthly airdrops for the community.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin Fear & Greed index rises to 16-month high as investors seek safe-haven assets\n\nNext week: Bitcoin to US$30,000?\n\n\u201cThe 25% rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price from last Friday\u2019s lows has nearly eliminated losses of the previous 12 months for 72.41% of the network\u2019s BTC-holding entities,\u201d wrote Coutts.\n\nAt the start of 2022, some 75% of these entities were profitable. Today, with Bitcoin prices lower than a year ago, the average cost for a Bitcoin entity is lower than price. This has resulted in higher profitability,\u201d wrote Coutts.\n\nSlava Demchuk, the co-founder of AMLBot, a developer of crypto anti-money laundering software, said that investors should monitor the impact of the Fed\u2019s interest rate hike on banks and financial institutions.\n\n\u201cIf [banks] continue to struggle, the Fed may persist in reducing interest rates, which would facilitate even more capital into the economy. This scenario would also impact cryptocurrency prices, as they often reflect these changes faster than the other financial assets,\u201d wrote Demchuk.\n\nFreeport\u2019s Goldstein expects more Bitcoin volatility as the banking crisis unfolds.\n\n\u201cPrices will likely not break through the US$30,000 mark unless another major threat to the U.S. banking system comes into play. If the Fed continues to hike interest rates, Bitcoin will face increased downward pressure,\u201d wrote Goldstein.\n\nAlex Reinhardt, the founder of the financial education platform Reinhardt Academy, said that further banking issues could propel Bitcoin above US$30,000.\n\n\u201cReaching US$30,000 in the next week and US$35,000 in the next 2-3 weeks seems realistic. As we\u2019ve seen in the past, strong growth waves in the crypto market can quickly turn into an avalanche-like movement, triggering both panic sales and panic buying,\u201d wrote Reinhardt.\n\nMarat Minkin, the co-founder of DeFi payment app TONBanking, expects Bitcoin\u2019s safe haven narrative to fuel its rally to above US$30,000.\n\n\u201cKey price level remains at US$28,600-28,750. Bitcoin\u2019s uptrend will continue next week, and the U-turn will be completed at US$32,000 by the end of the next week to close the month with a positive monthly gain,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSee related article: Banks are bringing systemic risks to crypto, says Circle\u2019s Disparte"

        "content": "Bitcoin bounced back above US$28,000 on Friday morning in Asia amid a rebound in all top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies and gains in equities overnight. The market shrugged off the latest warnings from U.S. regulators to crypto platforms. Litecoin led the gains. U.S equities rose on Thursday after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she would take \u201cadditional actions\u201d to protect customer deposits if necessary, following a raft of bank failures this month.\n\nSee related article: Terra-Luna co-founder Do Kwon reportedly arrested in Montenegro\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin rose 3.19% to US$28,225 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, gaining 13.02% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has surged 70% so far this year.\n\nHowever, U.S. dollar to Bitcoin liquidity is worsening due to the shutdown of crypto-friendly banks such as Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank this month that reduced access to U.S. dollar payment services. Bitcoin liquidity fell to a 10-month-low in March, according to a tweet by crypto data platform Kaiko on Friday.\n\nEther climbed 4.12% to US$1,811, a weekly gain of 8.54%.\n\nLitecoin was the biggest winner for the past 24 hours, gaining 7.07% to US$92.86 and up 18.09% for the week. The next halving event of the token is scheduled in August this year and previous halvings have tended to be preceded by price gains.\n\nThe U.S. SEC issued an investor alert on Thursday to advise caution about the risks in \u201ccrypto asset securities,\u201d stating that some providers of crypto investment services are not complying with federal securities laws, adding to the escalating conflict between U.S. regulators and crypto firms.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 3.36% in the past 24 hours to US$1.19 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours dropped 19.78%% to US$55.26 billion.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.21% to 4,120.05 points as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by Forkast sister company, CryptoSlam.\n\nU.S. equities closed higher on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.23%, the S&P 500 gained 0.30%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.01%.\n\nThe rebound in equities followed Janet Yellen\u2019s Thursday testimony to the U.S. Congress, reaffirming that the Treasury would take additional actions to secure bank deposits if necessary. This a day after she backed away from offering a blanket backstop for troubled banks.\n\nOn the inflation front, after the Federal Reserve\u2019s 25-basis-point rate hike on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference that the Fed\u2019s goal to bring annual inflation to the 2% range remains firm, and interest rates will be raised as needed to achieve this.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s next meeting on interest rate is May 3. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 65.8% chance the Fed will keep the rates at 4.75% to 5%. The chance of another 25 basis-point hike is at 34.2%, down from 49.4% on Wednesday.\n\nAhead of the opening of U.S. equity markets on Thursday, stock futures inched higher as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures moved up 0.06%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.08%. The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.01%.\n\nSee related article: South Korea arrests former Coinone exchange official for alleged crypto-listing bribery"

        "content": "Bitcoin NFT inscription activity has remained strong with consistency in the daily number of NFTs inscribed on Bitcoin. At the same time, the infrastructure to foster Bitcoin trading is finally coming together with the development of wallets and marketplaces supporting Ordinals.\n\nNFT marketplaces Gamma and Magic Eden added support for Bitcoin NFTs this week. While the initial response of traders has been subdued, the activity is expected to pick up soon.\n\nImproving the infrastructure around Bitcoin NFTs\n\nBitcoin NFTs, also known as Ordinals, began with much fanfare in late January as they enhanced the utility and revenue of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nDune dashboard from data analyst dgtl_assets shows that the Ordinals inscription activity remains robust, with nearly 580,000 NFTs inscribed in less than three months.\n\nCumulative sum and number of daily BTC NFTs inscribed. Source: Dune\n\nWhile the daily inscription activity is vigorous, the trading volume of Bitcoin NFTs is still muted, which can be primarily attributed to the absence of Bitcoin wallets and supporting marketplaces.\n\nOrdinals require a specially designed Bitcoin wallet that recognizes content files on discernable satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin, and facilitates their transfer. Hiro and Xverse are the leading wallet providers in the space.\n\nMark Hendrickson, the product lead at Hiro, told Cointelegraph that the \u201cactive users for the wallet are up significantly in general this year, around 350%.\u201d The activity picked up significantly since February, thanks to the Ordinals hype.\n\nMeanwhile, Xverse added Ordinals support on February 15. So far, the Xverse Chrome browser extension has been downloaded on over 10,000 browsers and 20,000 mobile wallets, with Hiro\u2019s download numbers surpassing 90,000. Hiro began supporting Bitcoin and Bitcoin NFTs in February.\n\nMarketplaces come together\n\nSince March 19, there has been considerable improvement in the space, with Gamma and Magic Eden launching support for Ordinals trading on March 20 and March 22, respectively. So far, the marketplaces have met with a soft opening with less than $1 million in trading volume on both venues.\n\nIn comparison, OpenSea has facilitated more than $10 million in daily trading volume on Ethereum NFT trades alone on most days in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nGamma users have completed around 182 Bitcoin NFT purchases since launch. In contrast, Magic Eden has done close to 18.94 BTC (worth around $530,000) volume since launch, with the Bitcoin DeGods collection dominating volumes by 67%.\n\nRelated: Stacks (STX) surges as Bitcoin NFT hype grows, but its blockchain activity raises concern\n\nAdditionally, Hendrickson noted that Magic Eden enjoys an advantage in \u201cthe cross-protocol department, given that they\u2019ve previously rolled out support for Solana, Ethereum and Polygon. This could help serve cross-chain trading needs faster, especially as demand increases for moving liquidity across chains to access their various NFT markets.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Ordinals top collections on Magic Eden. Source: Magic Eden\n\nAt the same time, he noted that \u201cGamma has an advantage among Ordinals marketplaces given their deep focus on Bitcoin-based technologies.\u201d Data provided by Hendrickson shows that the number of Hiro users interacting with Gamma surged significantly to around 2,144 weekly users as the hype around Bitcoin NFTs kicked off.\n\nNumber of Hiro clients that connected their wallets to Gamma. Source: Hiro\n\nThe Bitcoin NFT trading activity is expected to pick up. Ordinals provide superior security guarantees than NFT ecosystems elsewhere. The digital media file of Ordinals is stored directly on the Bitcoin blockchain and enjoys the same security guarantees as regular BTC transfers, whereas other ecosystems like Ethereum store the content file of the NFT on third-party storage solutions like AWS and IFPS. Hendrickson noted, \u201cTheir long-term durability is a huge advantage.\u201d\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "It\u2019s been a tough year for cryptocurrency, a decentralized digital payment system that uses coding to verify transactions. The collapse of the massive exchange FTX made international headlines, and multiple other companies in the industry have recently failed. Signature Bank , which focused heavily on crypto, also failed, and the price of major coins crashed earlier this month .\n\nFor many of those in the crypto industry, the recent criticism and negative press attention is well-deserved.\n\n\u201cI'm not going to defend the activity of the criminals and scammers of this industry,\u201d said Caitlin Long, a massive crypto supporter. \u201cIn fact, I've been very public, calling them out.\u201d\n\nLong is a Wall Street veteran and current CEO of Custodia Bank. She got fully involved with the technology a few years ago after she tried to donate to her alma mater, the University of Wyoming, with Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. She couldn\u2019t because of the state\u2019s laws, and then quickly discovered that there was an opportunity for Wyoming.\n\n\u201cWe're not going to try to be on the coattails,\u201d Long said. \u201cWe can actually lead in something here.\u201d\n\nSince then, Long has been instrumental in making Wyoming one of the most crypto-friendly states in the country . In the past few years, state lawmakers have passed a couple dozen laws trying to attract new crypto businesses to the windswept Cowboy State, including one this year that would authorize the state treasurer to issue its own digital currency.\n\nLong said crypto has brought new people and jobs to Wyoming, which has struggled for years to diversify its economy beyond the energy industry.\n\n\u201cThis is incredible. I'm seeing people coming from Denver, as opposed to our kids going to Denver the other way around,\u201d she said.\n\nOther Western states have also tried to stay ahead of the curve. Colorado was the first state to accept cryptocurrency to pay taxes , and one study ranked Nevada as the best state for crypto enthusiasts due to its friendly laws and high number of employees in the sector.\n\nBut some experts are questioning whether states should be trying to attract crypto.\n\n\u201cThese crypto assets are not tied at all to the real economy,\u201d said Chris Odinet, a law professor at the University of Iowa. \u201cThere are not merchants and commercial firms with consumer and commercial goods and supply chains behind them. So then I think you have to ask, what really is this for?\u201d\n\nAt the center of this debate is the fight over whether crypto should be a part of banking. Wyoming is the first state to grant companies the ability to house digital currencies alongside fiat currencies under one roof. Fiat currencies are backed by a government, rather than a physical commodity like gold or silver. This is called a Special Purpose Depository Institution ( SPDI ). Importantly, those crypto assets are backed by cash reserves, but Odinet said they still might not be a good idea.\n\n\u201cAllowing banks themselves \u2013 pre-existing banks \u2013 to provide crypto investment or crypto custodial services is, in my view, a grave mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if the 2008 financial crisis taught us anything, it's that keeping bank banking simple is really a pillar of avoiding financial harm and the contagion that can follow.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the Federal Reserve Board denied the membership application of Long\u2019s Custodia Bank. They said the firm\u2019s focus on crypto presented too many safety and soundness risks . Long was not a fan of that decision, and litigation about how the Fed handled Custodia\u2019s application is pending .\n\n\u201cBizarrely, the Biden administration decided to make an example for the rest of the crypto industry of Custodia,\u201d Long said. \u201cIf they really wanted to solve the crypto problem, frankly, they ought to look at the laws that the Wyoming legislature in their wisdom passed.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Congress is trying to regulate digital assets. Wyoming\u2019s junior senator, Cynthia Lummis has been called the \u201c Crypto Queen ,\u201d and recently introduced the Responsible Financial Innovation Act with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y).\n\n\u201cIt will take our existing financial regulatory structure and just lay cryptocurrency assets on top of it,\u201d Lummis said during a recent press call.\n\nThe U.S. Senate has yet to take action on the bill. For self-described skeptics like Odinet, there is a place for cryptocurrency and, especially, its underlying technology, blockchain \u2013 but in a more limited capacity.\n\n\u201cI understand and agree that banks will and should play a role in supporting crypto firms, but only like they support any other commercial enterprise,\u201d Odinet said.\n\nIn a recent letter regarding Wyoming\u2019s cryptocurrency laws, Gov. Mark Gordon exemplified both a nervousness and excitement he has regarding digital assets. Many state residents, including investors in Bitcoin, will likely be treading carefully in the next few months and weighing whether or not crypto is a valuable asset to their community.\n\n\u201cFirst movers are not always rewarded. They are, however, vital to progress,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story was produced by the Mountain West News Bureau, a collaboration between Wyoming Public Media, Nevada Public Radio, Boise State Public Radio in Idaho, KUNR in Nevada, the O'Connor Center for the Rocky Mountain West in Montana, KUNC in Colorado, KUNM in New Mexico, with support from affiliate stations across the region.

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nThe mining industry is well positioned to participate in a new bitcoin (BTC) cycle, Bernstein said in a research report Thursday.\n\nThe broker sees positive catalysts from the largest cryptocurrency\u2019s safe haven status, the reward halving due early 2024 and lower energy and equipment costs.\n\nRising bitcoin prices \u2013 the largest cryptocurrency by market cap has climbed 70% this year \u2013 and easing energy and equipment costs bode well for cash generation and the leverage position of miners, the report said. This should help improve gross margins in 2023.\n\nIf the bitcoin price continues to rally, Bernstein expects miners\u2019 production in March and April to exceed their BTC liquidations, leading to a net increase in holdings of the cryptocurrency. This could help the companies\u2019 debt repayment positions because bitcoin held as treasury assets can be liquidated at better prices to meet debt obligations.\n\nIn the medium to long term, the next main catalyst for miners is the halving, the note said. Roughly every four years, the total number of bitcoin that miners can potentially earn is cut by 50%.\n\n\u201cHalvings make BTC more scarce by reducing supply, thus leading to prices rising,\u201d and this results in more miners joining the network, which increases the hashrate and the network security.\n\nIf the 2024 halving follows the same pattern as earlier ones, the BTC mining industry would see \u201clower competitive intensity\u201d due to the sector\u2019s wipe-out in the bear market of 2022, and higher bitcoin prices, which would deliver improved profitability before additional mining capacity comes online, the report added.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Miners\u2019 Revenue From Fees Rises Suggesting Onset of Major Bull Run"

Source: TradingView\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, traders preferred Bitcoin over Ether, hoping it would protect them from the ongoing banking turmoil in the U.S. and other parts of the world.

If the fractal plays out, the pair could rally toward the same resistance level by June 2023.\n\nIn other words, Ether has a decent chance of rebounding by more than 15% to around 0.075 BTC. Conversely, a break below the ascending trendline support will invalidate the bullish fractal.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The Bitcoin bounty, dubbed Nakamoto_1 , will be unlocked by the first space traveler to reach the moon and obtain the wallet's private key, which will be etched onto a Lunar Outpost MAPP Rover launching into space later this year.\n\nSocial Intelligence company LunarCrush is sending a treasure chest of Bitcoin to the Earth\u2019s moon. The Bitcoin bounty, dubbed Nakamoto_1, will be unlocked by the first space traveler to reach the moon and obtain the wallet\u2019s private key, which will be etched onto a Lunar Outpost MAPP Rover launching into space later this year.\n\nLunarCrush teamed up with global leader in commercial planetary mobility Lunar Outpost , to send this lunar treasure chest to the moon. Animation studio Golden Wolf , and Bitcoin developer tools company Hiro partnered with LunarCrush to make Nakamoto_1 come to life. The technology and design partners created and will sell an NFT collection to raise funds for the Bitcoin bounty. The goal of this Web3-powered space race is to inspire the next generation of interplanetary exploration.\n\n\"When you put out a seemingly unachievable goal, the innovation that happens can be incredible. Our goal is to inspire people to build communities that will unlock a new era of exploration,\" said Joe Vezzani, CEO of LunarCrush. \"We envision classrooms, groups, companies, and even DAOs coming together to reach the Moon and split the treasure chest's rewards. It's like Willy Wonka's 'golden ticket' for the Web3 era, and we couldn't be more excited to see how it all unfolds.\"\n\nThe process of engraving the private key affixed to the rover will be fully documented, providing transparency and ensuring that no one, including the contributing teams, has access to the private keys. Once Lunar Outpost's MAPP Rover lands on the moon, anyone on Earth can create a plan to reach it and unlock the bounty of digital gold. The rover will be taken to the moon in Q4 of this year via a SpaceX rocket, but for security reasons the exact date has not yet been disclosed.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"What may sound outlandish to some will open new frontiers that haven't been explored outside the mind in a long time. Future generations will look to us as pioneers of interplanetary exploration and adventure,\" said Dr. Forrest Meyen, Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Lunar Outpost. \"As the Google Lunar XPRIZE kickstarted the commercial lunar rover industry, we view Nakamoto_1 as an opportunity to inspire the next generation to overcome challenges in space travel and exploration. LunarCrush is using modern blockchain technology to deliver a treasure instead of organizing a prize committee. This structure incentivizes exploration while unlocking the best of human ingenuity. Lunar Outpost is proud to provide our first-in-history commercial lunar surface transportation to innovative projects like Nakamoto_1.\n\nTo fund the Bitcoin bounty, LunarCrush will sell a special collection of Bitcoin-secured NFTs starting March 28th at lunarcrush.com/nakamoto1. Twenty-five percent of sales of the NFTs will go towards funding the treasure chest and twenty-five percent of sales will go to funding a \"Community Marketing Wallet,\" which will go toward funding Bitcoin core development and STEM education related causes. The NFTs will be priced at $250 USD. Secondary NFT sales on the Gamma.io marketplace, along with any contributions to the public wallet, will further increase the value of the treasure chest sent to the Moon. In addition, the teams will inscribe some of the NFT concept art as Ordinals and will include them in the treasure chest.\n\nGolden Wolf, an award-winning creative studio known for design and animation, was contracted to create stunning NFTs and imagery that range from static images to heavily animated collectables that help set the tone for the project.\n\n\"We loved the idea that the art could inspire a new generation of young people to look to the stars, like a contemporary version of an Apollo 11 poster on a bedroom wall,\" said Ingi Erlingsson, Founder and CEO of Golden Wolf. \"We wanted the aesthetic to feel modern and unique, with a hint of vintage sci-fi art.\"\n\nBitcoin was selected as the currency of choice for the treasure chest because it's the most long-lasting, secure, and future-proof form of money. Hiro provided technical support for the creation of the Bitcoin-backed NFTs that will fund the treasure chest.\n\n\"We're excited to inspire a new generation of space explorers as they make that next small step for the world,\" said Alex Miller, CEO of Hiro.\n\nTo learn more about Nakamoto_1, please visit: lunarcrush.com/nakamoto1\n\nABOUT LUNARCRUSH\n\nThere's more to markets than just trading off of price.

Two weeks later, Mastercard boldly integrated the stablecoin into its infrastructure in the Asia-Pacific region, allowing users to spend USDC through its network. It\u2019s happening, folks!\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget about Bitcoin (BTC) \u2014 that digital gold is still on the rise and decoupling from Wall Street, once again proving its value proposition and prompting calls for a hedge against equity markets in the long run.\n\nThis week\u2019s Crypto Biz documents the latest developments on worldwide crypto adoption, and how banking system fears impact the crypto space.\n\nMastercard to settle transactions for stablecoin wallet in APAC\n\nGlobal payment provider Mastercard has made another move into the crypto space to allow retail customers in the Asia-Pacific region to spend stablecoins anywhere Mastercard is accepted. This move was made possible by a partnership with Stables, an Australian stablecoin platform. Users can spend and save USDC by converting it into fiat and settling on the Mastercard network. The wallet will accept deposits in several stablecoins, including Tether (USDT) and Binance USD (BUSD), with all deposits automatically converted into USDC.\n\nWe've partnered with @Mastercard and @circle to allow people to spend $USDC anywhere Mastercard is accepted - that's over 54 million locations worldwide! pic.twitter.com/KE8PS0bEOz \u2014 Stables (@stables_money) March 21, 2023\n\nMetaMask enables direct crypto purchases in Nigeria\n\nOn-ramps for digital assets are also increasing in Nigeria, as crypto wallet MetaMask expanded direct transactions with local banks. MetaMask\u2019s parent firm ConsenSys has partnered with crypto fintech MoonPay, enabling users in the country to purchase crypto via instant bank transfers without requiring a credit or debit card.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT\u2019s Cryptofinance newsletter. This week, we\u2019re looking at the UK and crypto\u2019s banking crisis.\n\nThe demise of crypto\u2019s favourite American banks has slimmed the industry\u2019s access to the traditional financial system, fuelling theories that crypto is being run out of town, at least in the US.\n\nFewer banks accepting crypto means fewer places for companies to park their customers\u2019 assets. But this trend \u2014 dubbed \u201cOperation Chokepoint\u201d by a fevered few on social media \u2014 isn\u2019t stopping at America\u2019s borders. British banks are going cold on crypto, too.\n\nNatWest and other large UK banks have imposed limits on how much money can flow to and from crypto exchanges. Citing a challenging regulatory environment, online payments provider Paysafe recently said it would wind down services to UK customers of Binance, the largest trading shop crypto has to offer.\n\nCoupled with the wobble in America, the trend has set off alarm bells. Lobbying group CryptoUK this week wrote to the UK\u2019s economic secretary Andrew Griffith expressing \u201cdeep concerns\u201d about blanket bans and restrictions of transfers from UK banks to crypto asset platforms.\n\nThe group urged the government to \u201cfind a path forward\u201d and consider facilitating meetings between banking and crypto C-suite heads.\n\nOne can see why they think it\u2019s worth a shot. The UK government has been explicit about embracing crypto.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m selling the UK as a place to set up shop, but if you can\u2019t get banking support, what\u2019s the point? Potential newcomers will just not bother coming here,\u201d Ian Taylor, CryptoUK board advisor, told me over the phone.\n\nLisa Cameron, an MP who is the chair of the all-party parliamentary group for crypto, told me she raised crypto\u2019s banking issue with Kevin Hollinrake, parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department for Business and Trade.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s counterintuitive to the UK\u2019s crypto vision. De-banking the industry could undermine the UK remaining an international hub of fintech,\u201d she said.\n\nIn my view, the more pressing issue is whether banks \u2014 in their aversion to risk \u2014 are actually doing more of a disservice to UK consumers.\n\nThe risk is that the business will just be carried out offshore, where it\u2019s harder to track down money or executives. As we have seen in the past year, companies in offshore jurisdictions can still sting customers. FTX in the Bahamas and Terraform Labs in Singapore are prime examples.\n\nThe banks already do know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering checks for crypto companies in the UK. Authorities in Britain have not been explicit at all about the risks to banks in accepting crypto business, unlike in the US. So what has changed?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a moral hazard. It\u2019s not good consumer protection,\u201d said one industry professional who works in London. \u201cThe banks are not accepting that they play an important part in protecting people from fraud.\u201d\n\nBut asking banks to embrace crypto remains a hard sell. A bank\u2019s choice of its customer is a decision made by a private, commercially minded company.\n\n\u201cMy concern is the hyperbole will, over time, be negative for crypto because it makes the industry look a little bit like it\u2019s throwing its toys out the pram,\u201d said one person who works in London\u2019s crypto scene.\n\nCryptoUK doesn\u2019t help itself when its members generate their own regulatory controversies. One prime example is Binance, which the Financial Conduct Authority decided was incapable of being effectively regulated after the exchange failed to supply the agency with basic information.\n\nCryptoUK said it \u201cproactively engages\u201d with members when negative feedback from regulators is received, and would offboard a member if issues \u201cgo unresolved.\u201d\n\nIn any case, one individual familiar with Westminster\u2019s approach to digital assets told me recently that the government was not concerned with being first on digital assets, nor was it swayed by any advantages afforded to a first mover.\n\nLet someone make the mistakes first and then pick up the pieces, they said. So no matter how many turn out to fight in crypto\u2019s corner in the halls of Westminster, it might all fall on deaf ears.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on the UK\u2019s crypto tug of war? Email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nWeekly highlights: US assault on crypto\n\nAuthorities in Montenegro arrested Do Kwon, co-founder and chief executive of Terraform Labs, the company behind the terraUSD and luna tokens whose collapses sparked last year\u2019s epic crypto market crash. The country\u2019s interior ministry said Kwon was arrested for using a forged passport from Costa Rica on his way to Dubai. To top it off Kwon was then indicted on criminal charges in the US late on Thursday. Read my story \u2014 together with colleagues Marton Dunai and Joe Miller \u2014 here.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission sued crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, whose companies include Tron and BitTorrent, as well as a host of celebrities for improperly touting crypto tokens.\n\nThe White House let rip at crypto too. In an annual economic report it said \u201ccrypto assets currently do not offer widespread economic benefits\u201d and that much of the crypto activity was covered by existing regulations.\n\nSushiSwap, a decentralised finance project, says it has been subpoenaed by the SEC. A social media post this week is looking to establish a defence fund to pay legal fees.\n\nSoundbite of the week: Coinbase vs SEC\n\nIt was not a good week for Coinbase. The Securities and Exchange Commission told the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange it was considering a potential enforcement action over possible securities laws violations. Coinbase said it covered its staking products, in which customers agree to lock up their tokens in other crypto projects, in return for a high yield.\n\nIts shares fell 13 per cent on Thursday. Check out my story with Stefania Palma here. That led to a furious online pushback from the company, led by chief legal officer Paul Grewal. He said on Twitter:\n\n\u201cWhen Coinbase filed to go public in 2021, our S1 described our business in much detail, including 57 references to staking and details on our asset listing process. The SEC approved us to go public, knowing those details. Now they have changed their mind on what is allowed.\u201d\n\nOne can sympathise to a degree; Coinbase has been offering these products openly for years and has other SEC licences.\n\nBut that SEC S1 \u2018approval\u2019 only applies to the accuracy of the disclosures. In the risk section of that filing Coinbase warned about legal uncertainty over several of its products. It even highlighted one in particular. \u201cFor example, there is regulatory uncertainty regarding the status of our staking activities under the US federal securities laws,\u201d it said.\n\nMaybe Coinbase\u2019s management was taken aback by the SEC\u2019s move but the lawyers who wrote the S1 could not have been surprised.\n\nData mining: Open interest on Deribit reaches all-time high\n\nThe world\u2019s largest crypto options exchange isn\u2019t Binance but a little-known exchange called Deribit. You might recall Deribit helped push Three Arrows Capital into liquidation, claiming the hedge fund had failed to repay it $80mn.\n\nAccording to data provided by the exchange, open interest on the platform has exceeded $20bn this week for the first time. More than $18bn of positions are options on bitcoin and Ethereum. Options give investors the right but not the obligation to buy the coins by a set date in the future.\n\nMost calls expire at the end of March and the majority of these contracts have a strike price of $30,000. That suggests crypto investors are optimistic, at least for the next week.\n\nCryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford.

        "title": "Bitcoin's Price: 10 Reasons for a 2023 Skyrocket - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In 2023, Bitcoin price increased by more than 60% since a terrible 2022 when it fell by more than 64%. After a protracted bear crypto market, some have dubbed the most recent bounce a bull trap, yet there are good reasons to think Bitcoin\u2019s most beautiful days are still to come. No one can agree on the appropriate statistic or signal for determining Bitcoin\u2019s future course; this article aims to assess the Bitcoin price in 2023. Here are the top 10 reasons for the Bitcoin price to skyrocket in 2023:\n\nLarger block sizes: Block size has recently been cited as a critical indicator for the rise in cryptocurrency prices. The importance of block size evaluation is in our ability to assess network activity by counting the number of transactions that take place there. The rise of ordinals, or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) based on Bitcoin, which are digital representations of ownership of works of art, media, and collectibles, is probably responsible for this increase in activity. There have been more than 150,000 ordinals produced since their debut in January. The crypto\u2019s average block size has risen by 20.5%, reaching a record high short of 2.5 gigabytes.\n\nRecord address expansion: The number of Bitcoin addresses with a balance greater than zero also reached a record high. Growth of non-zero addresses has mainly remained stable year after year, regardless of market sentiment, similar to mining difficulty. Upwards of 44.6 million addresses have some amount of the coin as of this writing. Five years ago, there were 23 million people in this group.\n\nInvestor favorite: The great mining difficulty may be the most significant under-the-radar statistic. The more incredible the mining difficulty, the more decentralized and secure the Bitcoin network grows, making this one of the most critical measures of the token\u2019s health. Since the cryptocurrency launch 14 years ago, despite price fluctuations and many bear markets, the number of nodes running the Bitcoin code has increased worldwide, and more potent mining processors have come online. This pattern confirms that, despite the crypto winter, the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network are continuously increasing. This opinionates that Bitcoin is one of the most enticing reasons to invest in Bitcoin right now since it gives investors a chance to purchase it while it is still well below its highs.\n\nThe four-year cycles of Bitcoin: Long-term Bitcoin investors are aware that the cryptocurrency historically moves in cycles of four years. There is undoubtedly a pattern, even though the timing is not ideal, and there is some debate as to whether this pattern is getting weaker over time.\n\nUS Federal Reserve Rate Increase: In December 2022, the US Federal Reserve announced a less drastic rate increase of only 25 basis points, aiding Bitcoin to continue its upward trend and outperform other currencies. This is fantastic news for Bitcoin investors because a higher Bitcoin market typically results from a weaker US dollar.\n\nMark Mobius prediction: According to Mark Mobius, Bitcoin\u2019s bottom price will be $10,000 in 2023. While some would see this forecast as bad news for Bitcoin, others think it will ultimately result in a more robust market in the long run. Investors and analysts have already discussed Mobius\u2019 prediction, but it is still unclear whether it will come true.\n\nWide acceptance: More companies accept bitcoin, and more straightforward payment methods are being developed. There have been two effects of Bitcoin\u2019s widespread popularity. First, more people utilizing Bitcoin for transactions has raised the demand for the currency. Second, it has improved Bitcoin\u2019s standing as a kind of money. Bitcoin has benefited from mainstream acceptance due to rising demand, credibility, and adoption.\n\nDecentralization: One crucial feature distinguishing bitcoin from conventional currencies is its decentralization. The blockchain is immune to censorship, fraud, and hacking efforts because transactions are recorded on a decentralized public ledger. Users can send and receive transactions directly using a peer-to-peer network, cutting out middlemen like banks or payment processors.\n\nAdoption of NFTs and DeFi: NFTs and DeFi are well-known blockchain use cases that offer transparent and secure ways to transfer ownership and provide financial services without middlemen. As a result, NFTs have sparked interest in the art world and DeFi has made it possible to earn interest, leading to a rise in Bitcoin use. Because of its rarity, security, liquidity, and stability, bitcoin is appealing for NFT and DeFi applications, which raises its demand and adaptability overall."

Researchers at the University of New Mexico found that Bitcoin\u2019s environmental footprint is similar to extracting and refining crude oil.\n\nVon Wong notes that while a single Google search consumes about 1,080 Joules of energy, just one Bitcoin transaction consumes a disastrous 6,995,000,000 Joules. That\u2019s nearly 6.5 million times more energy than Googling something and nearly 24,300 times more energy than streaming an hour of Netflix consumes.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s energy problem is significant. However, it\u2019s not an unsolvable problem, argues Von Wong. Software changes could instantly clean up Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, many people don\u2019t fully understand Bitcoin and even those who use Bitcoin might not realize the damage it causes and how it affects climate change. Von Wong\u2019s latest project is designed to bring attention to the issue. He has regularly used stunning art and photography to raise awareness of social and environmental issues. Last year, one of Von Wong\u2019s images became the symbol of the United Nations\u2019 global plastic treaty. It wasn\u2019t Von Wong\u2019s first foray into raising awareness about the detrimental effects of plastic and pollution. In 2016, he created a stunning photo of a mermaid that had been beached by plastic bottles.\n\nVon Wong\u2019s fight against E-waste is another example of the photographer\u2019s ambitious ideas, passion, and excellent execution. Bitcoin uses about twice as much energy as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple combined. Bitcoin energy demands have increased by 100 times in the last five years.\n\nThe giant skull at the center of Von Wong\u2019s new image was built using wood, recycled Styrofoam, and over 300 pieces of electronic waste. Von Wong worked alongside a mechanical engineer, Jeremy, and fabricators Elana and Joel. The E-waste they used arrived courtesy of nonprofit Unirecycle.\n\nBitcoin mining generates more than 30,000 tons of E-waste annually, so Von Wong wanted to cover the piece in circuit boards. It was a monumental task, as the team needed to manually sort, organize, and fit every part onto the skull.\n\nThe \u201cSkull of Satoshi\u201d took about 1,000 hours of work and was brought to life in an abandoned warehouse. The building, used with permission by a demolition company hired to dismantle the structure, gives the images a dystopian, gritty vibe. Long tube lights add a cyberpunk feel to the shots.\n\nVon Wong included models in suits in the work because these are the people he hopes to reach. Institutional and financial investors support Bitcoin at the expense of the climate. The skull\u2019s eyes feature red lasers as an allusion to the \u201claser eye\u201d profile pictures used by some Bitcoin supporters. Von Wong even created laser eyes for his volunteer models to wear using red fairy lights.\n\nOver the next few months, the giant \u201cSkull of Satoshi\u201d will travel as part of the campaign for sustainable Bitcoin as Greenpeace will take it on tour. Many people were involved in the campaign, and a full list of credits is available on Benjamin Von Wong\u2019s blog.\n\nImage credits: Benjamin Von Wong."

Discover SCENE\n\nDaily transaction fees for minting Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions reached a new all-time high on Thursday of 9.28 BTC, around $257,460, according to a Dune Analytics report.\n\nThe surge is largely attributed to Bitcoin Apes, a variation of the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection that is being reproduced on the Bitcoin Network.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince the launch of the Ordinals project in January 2023, over $3.3 million in fees have been paid to put images, text, and even video games on the original blockchain.\n\nOrdinals just smashed its prior ATH for daily fees spent inscribing. $257,460 (9.28 BTC) has been spent on inscription fees today! Every single inscription is making the Bitcoin network more decentralized and more secure. pic.twitter.com/kV0CgVGnVF \u2014 Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) March 23, 2023\n\n\u201c[Bitcoin Apes] follow the same logic as Bitcoin Punks where the first byte-perfect image of a Bored Ape that is inscribed is the real one,\u201d pseudonymous NFT historian Leonidas told Decrypt on Twitter. \u201c8,397 Bitcoin Apes have already been inscribed, and once they have minted out, over $1M will have been spent inscribing the 10,000 exact copies of the Bored Ape Yacht Club images onto Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nOf the 466 GB of data that makes up the Bitcoin blockchain, Leonidas says that over 1GB is now images of monkeys.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTHESE DANG @BitcoinApes_ ARE CLOGGING UP BITCOIN CAN THE DEVS PLEASE DO SOMETHING pic.twitter.com/iRpYB17exJ \u2014 jake.bit (@jakegallen_) March 23, 2023\n\n\u201cIn a weird way this is actually really good for Bitcoin,\u201d Leonidas said. \u201cEvery extra transaction fee that is being paid to inscribe these apes is helping to secure the Bitcoin network by giving miners an additional revenue source to supplement the block rewards.\u201d\n\nLeonidas believes projects like Bitcoin Apes may be the solution to the long-standing question of what to do after the pre-programmed Bitcoin block rewards eventually go to zero in 2140.\n\nBut while JPEGs are becoming more popular on the Bitcoin Network, most Ordinal Inscriptions are text-based, according to Dune.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Apes do not compete with the original Bored Ape Yacht Club collection,\u201d Leonidas said. \u201cIn fact, several of the people I have talked to who are inscribing are big fans of the original collection and would love to hold one of the original Bored Apes someday.\u201d\n\nLeonidas says it was inevitable that the culture behind one of the most iconic NFT collections would spread to other blockchains, and that Bitcoin Apes confirm that trend.\n\nSome Bored Ape Yacht Club owners are concerned that copies of their NFTs are being created and traded on the Bitcoin blockchain. However, Leonidas believes such concerns are unwarranted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBlockchains solve the problem of provenance for digital art so there is no debate about whether the official Bored Ape Yacht Club holders are the holders of the original and Bored Apes\u2014anybody can verify that ownership on-chain,\u201d Leonidas explained. \u201cThis is just another derivative project of an iconic PFP collection that in my opinion just spreads the culture of the original PFP collection to even more people which ends up driving value back down to the official holders.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are actually doing the original Bored Ape Yacht Club holders a favor by storing all 10,000 images fully on-chain for the first time so that they will live on forever on Bitcoin at zero cost to the official holders or Yuga,\u201d Leonidas said.\n\nWhile holders of Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs may not be paying to inscribe their digital collectibles on Bitcoin, the floor price of Bitcoin Apes is steadily rising.\n\nThe floor price for Bitcoin Apes is 0.0101 BTC, around $285.00; on Ordinals Wallet, the floor price is 0.21 ETH, around $380.00 on Ordinals Market. Bored Ape Yacht Club Ethereum NFT, in comparison, has a floor price of 57.5 ETH, around $104,036 on OpenSea."

        "title": "How to Turn Your Bitcoin into Cash - GOBankingRates",
        "content": "D-Keine / iStock.com\n\nIt has been anything but a dull year for cryptocurrency \u2014 from the recent shutdown of a major exchange to the collapse of three financial institutions with a significant hand in the cryptocurrency market: Silvergate Capital, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The crypto market has seen a lot of volatility as a result, all during a period of heightened economic pressure.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that investors are wondering: How do you convert bitcoin to cash?\n\nHow Do I Cash Out My Bitcoin?\n\nYou have several options for trading in your bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency. Which option is best for you will depend on where you bought and stored your coins, how quickly you need the value back out of them and the nature of your approach to buying and liquidating investment assets.\n\nHere are five tried-and-true tactics for converting your bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to cash.\n\n1. Sell Bitcoin on a Cryptocurrency Exchange or Trading Platform\n\nUnless you\u2019ve locked your bitcoin, as you might do with what\u2019s known as staking, you can sell your bitcoin on an exchange at any time. You\u2019ll need to have an account with the exchange and move your crypto onto the platform before you sell. Make sure you pay attention to the fees associated, because those can vary by exchange or platform.\n\nIf you bought your bitcoin through an online investment house like Robinhood or eToro, you can sell through that firm for the corresponding broker\u2019s fee.\n\n2. Find a Bitcoin ATM\n\nCryptocurrency ATMs are becoming more and more available, and many \u2014 but not all \u2014 of them will allow you to sell your bitcoin and withdraw cash after following several security steps. This option is best saved for situations when you need cash fast, as the fees can be high \u2014 think up to 20%.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\n3. Spend It\n\nDebit cards that let you spend your crypto on everyday purchases are becoming increasingly mainstream. Transaction fees can vary, so do your homework before getting a crypto debit card.\n\nSome retailers will also take payment for their products or services directly from your digital wallet on a cryptocurrency exchange or platform.\n\n4. Send It to Another Investor in Return for Cash\n\nMost cryptocurrency exchanges offer peer-to-peer lending platforms, which could allow you to find a buyer for the bitcoin you\u2019d like to sell.\n\nMost importantly, you need to trust your potential buyer. There\u2019s always a chance that the cryptocurrency you transfer could reach your buyer before their cash deposits into your bank or PayPal account \u2014 so know as much as you can about who you\u2019re thinking about doing business with.\n\n5. Sell It Right From Your Crypto Wallet\n\nIf your crypto is securely stored in your cold wallet, you can sell it \u2014 for a fee \u2014 without moving it first. This will prevent you from having to transfer your crypto out of the wallet and onto a cryptocurrency exchange to make the sale.\n\nLedger and Trezor both offer bitcoin sales directly from your wallet.\n\nHow Do I Convert Bitcoin to Cash Instantly?\n\nThe process of liquidating your bitcoin quickly depends on how and where it\u2019s stored, but your best bet for going from crypto to cash in short order will most likely be via debit card, ATM card or expenditures at bitcoin-accepting retailers.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that transaction fees may apply for any method of converting your crypto to cash, but the fees are likely to get higher the faster the conversation needs to happen.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nCan I Cash Out Bitcoin to My Bank Account?\n\nYes, it\u2019s possible to move your bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to your bank account by selling it.\n\nIf you\u2019re not in a hurry, you can choose between two methods. Either pick a pre-set platform \u2014 like a cryptocurrency ATM or debit card \u2014 or find a buyer online and complete the sale on the blockchain or exchange. The latter process mandates trust and timely communication from both parties.\n\nMind the Bottom Line When Cashing In Cryptocurrency\n\nAlthough you have multiple choices to liquidate your bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into cash, it\u2019s essential to know what the associated fees and risks are.\n\nIf you\u2019re using a crypto ATM or debit card, you\u2019ll want to understand the fees associated with your transaction. If you decide to sell your coins to someone else, you may need to face the unknown \u2014 delays and fraud can be associated with online transactions like this. You could transfer your bitcoin to its buyer and find that they never intended to pay.\n\nProceed with caution, and be mindful of not only the opportunity you\u2019re pursuing, but also the potential downsides."

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens saw some profit booking on Thursday as the increased interest rates dragged the riskier assets lower. The US Federal Reserve increased the interest rate by another 25 basis points, shunning the hopes that it would turn dovish amid the banking crisis.\n\nHowever, the US Fed signaled that a pause in the rate hikes is on the cards any time soon, but ruled out any possibilities of a rate cut in the ongoing years. Overall, the risk-averse sentiments weighed on the crypto assets as the jitters returned.\n\nBitcoin dropped sharply after the interest rate hikes as the largest crypto token slipped below the $28,000 mark and was holding near $27,300. Its largest peer Ethereum was also down about 4 per cent, falling below the $,1750 level. Pain in the altcoins was severe.\n\nBarring the US dollar-pegged USD Coin and Litecoin, all other top crypto tokens were trading with big cuts on Thursday. Tron plunged 10 per cent, whereas XRP tumbled 9 per cent. Solana and BNB were down 5 per cent, each. The sole gainer, Litecoin, surged about 7 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply lower at $1.15 trillion, dropping as much as 3 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes inched up about 2 per cent, close to $68.05 billion.\n\n\n\nThe Bitcoin rally was interrupted by the interest rate hike of 25 basis points announced by the Fed in the latest FOMC meeting, said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin. \"Bitcoin and Ethereum while other digital assets followed a similar trend. The evolving banking situation in the US is making investors jittery and markets are expected to remain choppy,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBlockchain platform Polkadot will be hosting its first global blockchain conference named Polkadot Now India Conference in India with the aim to enter into the Indian Ecosystem. The event will be held on April 1-2, 2023 in Bangalore.\n\n\n\nThe two-day conference will feature a range of high-profile projects, including KILT Protocol, Astar Network, Moonsama, Public Pressure, Polkassembly, Unique Network, Polkadex and more than 30 diverse speakers from the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n\n\nTech View By WazirX Trade Desk\n\nRender Token (RNDR) is a distributed GPU rendering network built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to connect artists and studios in need of GPU compute power with mining partners willing to rent their GPU capabilities out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RNDR/USDT price chart has broken out of the megaphone pattern with good volume on the weekly timeframe, it is up by 3 per cent for the day. It bounced back from 20 EMA(exponential moving average) and is successfully trading above it which indicates there is a lot of interest from buyers in the token.\n\n\n\nThe next resistance for the RNDR token is expected at the $1.55 level and the next support could be expected around the $1.16 level.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Analysts agree that BTC could trade above $30,000 before a notable drawback.\n\nThe $1 million prediction by Balaji is unlikely, but short-term direction depends on FOMC.\n\nIn 2022, several analysts, at different intervals, gave their opinion on Bitcoin [BTC] hitting rock bottom. And on many occasions, the king coin did not agree with the analysts, even though some issues like the FTX collapse played a part in subsequent price drops.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nFast forward to 2023. It could seem that some of those calls were wrong, as BTC had only fared better. According to CryptoQuant analyst BaroVirtual, the condition of the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) age bands was instrumental to the strides recorded in the new year.\n\nCan BTC sustain the green?\n\nThe UTXO Age Bands summarizes the behavior of short and long-term holders in view of the macro shift in influence among both parties. The analyst opined that there was a bearish crossover between the 6 million to 12 million and 12 million to 18 million age bands. This confirmed the early bullish signal before the press time reflection.\n\nAn explanation of the data above points to the fact that new buyers within the longer UTXO age bands have emerged. This fostered the position for a further long-term HODL and has helped support BTC price action.\n\nHowever, BaroVirtual mentioned that BTC risks a bearish stance in the mid-term. Although he pointed out that the sell-off might not occur until BTC hits between $30,000 or $33,000 or in unusual circumstances, $37,000 to $40,000 region.\n\nThe analyst also defended his position by referring to the historically even bearish years and odd bullish seasons. He noted that he doesn\u2019t expect the potential second uptrend to be better than the first quarter, stating:\n\n\u201cBitcoin lives in 4-year cycles from one halving to another. An even year is a bear, and an odd year is a bull. Therefore, 2023 is bullish, but the 2nd uptrend in the cycle is always weaker than the 1st; that is, the previous historical high is not updated\u201d\n\n$30,000 or nothing because\u2026\n\nIn another historical data reference, Gigisulivan, another CryptoQuant analyst, pointed to the Short-Term Holder SOPR. This metric tracks coin movements and the status of investors selling at a loss or profit.\n\nThe analyst noted the metric was at its highest point since November 2021. At press time, the Short-Term Holder SOPR was 1.027. Since the value was above 1, it indicated that short-term investors were selling at a profit.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nHowever, Gigisulivan added that in bear market exits, the metric increase was a sign of a further uptrend instead of a decline. Like BaroVirtual, he also mentioned that BTC could rise above $30,000.\n\nAt the same time, he said the $1 million 90-day Bitcoin prediction of Coinbase\u2019s former CTO was unachievable. Meanwhile, the short-term BTC movement would also depend on the outcome of the FOMC meeting."

The company was using \"internal & open source software\", he said.\n\nMost mainstream companies such as AT&T Inc and Microsoft Corp that allow customers to pay with bitcoin typically use specialist payment processors that convert the cryptocurrency into, say, dollars and send the sum to the company.\n\nLike other cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is still little used for commerce in major economies, hampered by its volatility and relatively costly and slow processing times.\n\nMusk, who regularly posts comments on Twitter about cryptocurrencies, last month criticised conventional cash, saying when it \"has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn't look elsewhere\".\n\nHe had said that the difference with cash made it \"adventurous enough\" for the S&P 500 company to hold the cryptocurrency.\n\nFollowing Tesla's investment in bitcoin, companies including Mastercard Inc and Bank of New York Mellon Corp have embraced the emerging asset, sparking predictions that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will become a regular part of investment portfolios.\n\nRead more: Tesla's in-car cameras raise privacy concerns: Consumer Reports\n\nUber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the ride-hailing company discussed and \"quickly dismissed\" the idea of investing in bitcoin.

        "content": "Factors to Consider Before Using Bitcoin System\n\nTrading bots work slightly differently in theory than in practice. This is why we tested the bot in various areas that we believe are important to traders\u2019 everyday operations to see how the bot performs. Here are our findings:\n\nVerification System: 4.4/5\n\nThe signup process on Bitcoin System is straightforward. As described on its website, new users will require a government-issued ID and proof of address document like a utility bill. This is to pass the KYC process which is a must for all your account to prevent impersonation and fraud.\n\nWe found the verification process to be quick and easy. The platform did not ask for more information than was necessary to verify our identity. The process took about 20 minutes to complete.\n\nHowever, note that you will also be required to sign up with a partner broker when creating an account with Bitcoin System. These brokers are said to be regulated by internationally recognized regulatory agencies and will also require KYC documents.\n\nWithdrawal Process: 4.1/5\n\nBitcoin System does not have any minimum or maximum withdrawal requirement. withdrawals also take roughly 24 hours to complete once a withdrawal form has been submitted. Sometimes, the withdrawal time is less than 24 hours, but we cannot guarantee this as it depends on the total withdrawal volume and the withdrawal amount.\n\nWe found the withdrawal process to be adequate. Upon our first withdrawal, we were asked to verify our identity once more to ensure that the owner of the account was the one initiating the withdrawal.\n\nNote that while there are no limits with Bitcoin System, your payment provider e.g., banks or electronic wallets may impose certain limits.\n\nCosts and Fees: 5/5\n\nBitcoin System can be considered a cheap trading companion. The platform does not charge fees for everyday activities like deposits and withdrawals; however, they charge a 2% Commission for profit on the bot\u2019s profits.\n\nOur experience corroborates these claims as we were not charged for any of the activities. However, the bot works with its partner brokers to include a markup on the bid-ask spread for CFD pairs.\n\nUser Testimonials: 5/5\n\nUser testimonials for Bitcoin System have generally been positive. While there have been a few reviews and comments expressing difficulty with using the bots, most of the reviews have been positive.\n\nWe ensured that we did not count testimonials on the bot\u2019s website as those may be biased. We only used testimonials from high-quality websites with strong domains and websites that have proven neutrality towards products and services.\n\nCustomer Service: 3/5\n\nCustomer service on Bitcoin System was adequate, although, non-account holders might find it difficult to get in touch with the team. The communication channels provided are only shown to account holders, so potential users who may want to get in touch with the team may be at a disadvantage.\n\nAffiliated Brokers: 5/5\n\nThe brokers that Bitcoin System partners with are said to be regulated by the Cyprus Securities Exchange Commission (CySEC). While this is true for some, we cannot guarantee that all brokers are certified.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. In recent weeks, both coins have been experiencing an upward trend. The question on everyone\u2019s minds is, why are these coins pumping?\n\nAccording to the report, which aimed to explain the sudden surge in the values of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the influx of capital from institutional investors has been the driving force behind the price pump. Since February 2023, these investors have injected approximately $1.6 billion into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin is often referred to as the king of cryptocurrencies, and for good reason. It is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, with a market dominance of over 40%. BTC has seen significant growth in recent years.\n\nThere are several reasons why Bitcoin is currently pumping. One major factor is institutional adoption. Large companies and financial institutions are starting to invest in Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. This has led to a surge in demand for BTC, which in turn drives up its price.\n\nAnother factor contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s rise is the limited supply of cryptocurrency. Only 21 million BTC will ever exist, and with a growing number of people wanting to own it, the supply-demand dynamics come into play, causing the price to increase.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it is often referred to as the platform for decentralized applications (dApps). ETH has also been experiencing significant growth, with its price increasing steadily over the past few weeks.\n\nOne reason for Ethereum\u2019s recent rise is the growing popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. These applications are built on the Ethereum blockchain, and they allow users to lend, borrow, and trade cryptocurrencies without the need for a centralized intermediary. As DeFi continues to gain traction, demand for ETH will likely increase, driving up its price.\n\nAnother reason for ETH\u2019s rise is the recent launch of Ethereum 2.0. This upgrade to the Ethereum network promises to improve its scalability, security, and energy efficiency, making it more attractive to developers and users. This has led to increased optimism and interest in the platform, which in turn drives up the price of ETH.\n\nWhat is RenQ Finance?\n\nRenQ Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aims to bring new and innovative financial services to the blockchain ecosystem. It is a community-driven project that provides users with a suite of tools and products that enable them to participate in the emerging DeFi economy. The platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain and supports a wide range of assets, including ERC-20 tokens and popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nRenQ Finance offers a variety of services, including yield farming, liquidity provision, lending and borrowing, and more. The platform\u2019s primary product is the RenQ Vault, which allows users to earn high yields on their crypto assets by automatically investing them in a variety of DeFi protocols.\n\nThe RenQ Finance platform is governed by its community, with proposals and decisions made through a voting process. RenQ token holders can participate in governance and propose changes to the platform. This ensures that the platform is transparent, democratic, and driven by the community.\n\nWhy is it Good for Projects like RenQ Finance (RENQ)?\n\nThe recent price surges of BTC and ETH have had a positive impact on the entire cryptocurrency market. As the two largest cryptocurrencies, they set the tone for the rest of the market. When BTC and ETH are doing well, it typically signals a bullish sentiment in the market, which can lead to increased demand for other cryptocurrencies, including RENQ.\n\nAdditionally, the growing popularity of DeFi applications built on the Ethereum blockchain, such as Uniswap and Aave, has created a demand for interoperability between different blockchain networks. This is where projects like RenQ Finance come in. RenQ Finance is a multi-chain DeFi platform that allows users to access liquidity across different blockchain networks. As the demand for interoperability increases, platforms like RenQ Finance are well-positioned to benefit.\n\nFurthermore, the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin is a signal of the maturing cryptocurrency market. As more large companies and financial institutions start investing in cryptocurrencies, it brings more legitimacy to the industry and increases the chances of regulatory clarity. This can lead to a more stable and predictable market, which is good for all projects in the long run, including RenQ Finance.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "As traditional financial institutions face increased scrutiny and declining public trust, many investors are turning to cryptocurrencies as a more reliable and secure store of value.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, RenQ Finance, and Ethereum are becoming more attractive to investors. Their decentralized nature, security, and potential for long-term growth make them a strong choice for those looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin is the world\u2019s first and most well-known cryptocurrency, launched in 2009 by an anonymous individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Its decentralized nature and built-in scarcity have made it a popular choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nAs traditional banks struggle with issues of inflation, Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply and algorithmically-capped maximum supply of 21 million coins make it a strong alternative store of value. Despite recent volatility in the crypto market, Bitcoin has maintained its position as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ)\n\nRenQ Finance is a decentralized finance platform that uses advanced AI technology to offer users secure and efficient financial services. RenQ Finance is built on a blockchain that enables cross-chain interoperability, making it easy for users to transfer assets between different blockchains.\n\nRenQ Finance has gained significant attention in the crypto market, with its successful presale phase raising over $2.7 million and its potential for further growth. RenQ Finance has the potential to revolutionize the DeFi industry with its innovative approach to cross-chain exchange technology, offering a more effective and affordable method of transferring assets between different blockchains.\n\nAdditionally, Investors have gained more trust in RenQ Finance following its successful CertiK security audit. This has been a significant development for the project, as it assures investors that their investments are secure and that the platform is reliable. The audit found no critical vulnerabilities or issues in RenQ Finance\u2019s smart contracts, demonstrating that the project is built on a strong and secure foundation. This has further strengthened the project\u2019s position in the market and attracted more investors looking for a trustworthy DeFi project.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) using smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements that run on the Ethereum network, allowing developers to create a wide range of decentralized applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to online marketplaces.\n\nEthereum\u2019s popularity has grown significantly in recent years, and it is now the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Its decentralized nature and strong community support make it a reliable and secure choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nBitcoin Vs Ethereum Vs RenQ Finance: What is the difference\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and RenQ Finance are all cryptocurrencies, but they have different features, use cases, and technologies behind them.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. It was created in 2009 as a decentralized digital currency that could be used to make peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors. Bitcoin\u2019s main use case is as a store of value and a means of exchange. It has a limited supply, with a maximum of 21 million coins that can be mined, and its mining process is based on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm.\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a decentralized blockchain platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. It was created in 2015 to create a decentralized platform for building decentralized applications. Ethereum\u2019s main use case is as a platform for building dApps and smart contracts. It uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm and has no fixed supply, but instead uses a dynamic issuance model.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) is a multi-chain, decentralized exchange that allows for direct trading through the user\u2019s wallet app. It is designed to enhance decentralized trading and support DeFi protocols. RenQ Finance\u2019s main use case is as a decentralized exchange and it uses a Layer 2 scaling solution to reduce transaction costs and increase speed. RenQ Finance has a total supply of 1 billion coins.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the cryptocurrency market can be volatile, these three cryptocurrencies have shown resilience in the face of market fluctuations and are well-positioned for future growth. As the world becomes more digitally focused and decentralized, the future of Bitcoin, RenQ Finance, and Ethereum looks brighter than ever.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "How To Make Money Fast With Cryptocurrency in 2023 - GOBankingRates",
        "content": "KanawatTH / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nCryptocurrency is known for its volatility, and 2023 so far has been no exception \u2014 not least because of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank \u2014 but its potential for upswings keeps investors wondering how to make money fast with cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the wake of these bank closures, the value of the crypto market fell by more than $70 billion \u2014 only to rally again once the U.S. government announced that depositors at SVB and Signature Bank would quickly be restored access to their money. That government backing seems to soften crypto\u2019s risk profile, leaving many wondering how to make money with cryptocurrency in 2023.\n\nHow To Make Money With Cryptocurrency\n\nUnless you opt to invest in cryptocurrency stocks, your first step is to buy crypto. After you\u2019ve acquired your first crypto investment, try any or all of these tactics for making money with crypto:\n\n1. Trading\n\nYou can buy crypto and hold it until its value rises, then sell for a profit \u2014 and even engage in day trading if your goal is quick income.\n\nBut be wary: cryptocurrency and day trading are both high risk, so never invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\n2. Staking\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in holding cryptocurrency, you can stake it \u2014 or agree to park it on an exchange or in a staking pool for a period of time. You\u2019ll earn more crypto for keeping yours in place, because doing so helps fund blockchain operations.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nGenerally, you earn crypto by staking because you\u2019ll receive interest or dividends, often at a high rate. However, you often have to commit to a period of time to lock your crypto in the blockchain, and you\u2019ll be subject to the risks of keeping your crypto on an exchange.\n\n3. Lending\n\nYou can also opt to loan your cryptocurrency holdings out, allowing you to charge interest \u2014 sometimes with annual percentage yields of 15% or more.\n\nHowever, this makes your crypto less liquid, meaning it\u2019s harder to sell. More than one crypto lending platform has struggled with liquidity in recent months.\n\n4. Giveaways\n\nYou can earn free crypto in various ways, from looking for giveaways, also referred to as airdrops, to completing small tasks on websites in exchange for crypto coins, called faucets.\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to get free crypto through airdrops or faucets, you\u2019re not likely to earn much. And you\u2019ll need to be careful, because some of these \u201cfree giveaways\u201d are scams in disguise and will give you malware instead of free crypto.\n\n5. Mining\n\nMining is the computing process through which new coins are released into circulation. Not all coins are created through mining, but many are, including bitcoin. It can be profitable but requires extensive equipment and is very energy inefficient, meaning it\u2019s often expensive to get started and you might not make that investment back.\n\nKnow your local laws if you want to start mining for crypto. It\u2019s illegal in several countries and some U.S. states.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\n6. Gaming\n\nYou can earn crypto through play-to-earn NFT games like Axie Infinity, Zed Run and Gods Unchained. Complete tasks and compete with other players to win crypto or NFTs, which you can then reinvest into the game, hold or sell.\n\nSome of these games offer free demos, so you can try them out to make sure you enjoy them, but you\u2019ll typically need to invest in NFTs to play for profit.\n\nGetting Started With Cryptocurrency\n\nThere are tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies to choose from \u2014 so it\u2019s important to do your research and understand the market before you make your first crypto purchase. Bitcoin and ethereum are both good options to start, as the two biggest cryptos in terms of market cap. You could also focus on cryptocurrencies with specific use cases, like cardano and chainlink.\n\nWhat Are the Top Factors in Evaluating a Cryptocurrency?\n\nAs with any investment, it\u2019s important to find the right fit for your goals. Common factors to consider include transaction fees, decentralization, storage options, whether or not the currency is backed by a government currency like the U.S. Dollar and whether there\u2019s a limit on the number of coins that can be generated.\n\nThe Pros and Cons of Making Money With Cryptocurrency\n\nYou can make money, and fast, with cryptocurrency. However, you must follow industry news, know crypto trading best practices, guard against theft, do your research on coins and crypto exchanges and have an exit strategy ready in case you need one.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nMaking money with crypto is a possibility for those who can navigate the market\u2019s volatility with their eyes and ears open.\n\nFAQ Here's some insight into the most frequently asked questions about making money with crypto in 2023. How can I make a fast profit with crypto? Watching prices, entering and exiting investments at the right time and entering early are common ways to make a quick profit with crypto.\n\nCan I earn daily from cryptocurrency? Yes. With research and the right strategy in place, it's possible to earn daily income from cryptocurrency. For example, if you're skilled in an NFT game, you'll probably be able to earn daily by winning competitions.\n\nCan you make $100 a day trading crypto? Depending on your starting investment and return, it may be possible to make $100 per day or more with cryptocurrency \u2013 especially if you're an experienced day trader.\n\nIs cryptocurrency a good investment right now? The viability of crypto as an investment can fluctuate. Pay attention to market conditions, bank news, blockchain developments and the performance of individual cryptocurrency investments over time. When timed and executed well, crypto can be a lucrative investment for some investors. Just be sure you have a high tolerance for risk before you enter the market.\n\nIs cryptocurrency a safe investment? No, cryptocurrency is not a safe investment. It is very high risk \u2013 but it also has the potential for high rewards. Like many other investments, crypto offers its investors no guarantees. If you have funds you can afford to risk, you could reap considerable rewards, but you could also lose your entire investment.\n\nHere's some insight into the most frequently asked questions about making money with crypto in 2023.\n\nAmber Barkley contributed to the reporting for this article."
