        "content": "Investment giant BlackRock (BLK) filed an application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Thursday using the crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) for custody and market pricing, in what would be the first product of its kind in the U.S. if approved.\n\nKey Takeaways BlackRock filed an SEC application on Thursday for a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe application lists Coinbase as the custodian for assets and pricing data.\n\nIf approved, it would be the first product of its kind in the U.S.\n\nWhile the SEC has previously approved Bitcoin futures ETFs, it denied multiple spot ETF applications for the coin.\n\nThe new iShares Bitcoin Trust will be listed on the Nasdaq exchange and pricing will be calculated daily based on the CF CME Bitcoin Reference Rate, which \u201caggregates the notional value of Bitcoin trading across major Bitcoin spot exchanges,\u201d according to the prospectus. All shares in the ETF will be fully backed by BTC and no new shares can be issued without delivery of the corresponding value of tokens.\n\nHowever, the BlackRock offering still requires approval from the SEC, which has so far pushed back against multiple spot-based ETF applications.\n\nThe SEC is currently involved in a court battle with digital asset management firm Grayscale over its plans to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) from a futures-backed index to spot, and may not approve BlackRock\u2019s application until a court ruling is due later this year.\n\nIn its first oral arguments against Grayscale, the SEC cited the \u201cfragmented and unregulated\u201d spot market as the reason for its stance, arguing that the regulated futures market provided more security for investors and pointed to \"surveillance sharing\" agreements that protect against market manipulation.\n\nRegulatory approval for the iShares Bitcoin Trust would be a boost for Coinbase after suffering deposit outflows after a separate legal action from the SEC. The regulator accused the company of operating an \"unlawful exchange.\"\n\nBlackRock shares finished 2.71% higher on Thursday, while Coinbase shares edged up 0.65%.\n\n"

        "content": "Bitcoin still closed the week slightly negative, for the second week in a row, by 0.21%. Ether also posted a second consecutive weekly decline. It fell 10.84%. Coin Metrics measures a week in crypto, which trades 24 hours a day, from the 4:00 p.m. ET stock market close one Friday to the next.\n\nEven altcoins rose, with the tokens tied to Solana and Cardano gaining 4.5% and 2%, respectively. Binance Coin was 2.75% higher, litecoin gained 3% and the Uniswap token advanced 4%.\n\nCrypto prices climbed to end the week Friday, a day after the largest asset manager in the world jumped into the race to launch the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S.\n\nInvestors were weighing the latest development in the crypto industry's battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for regulatory recognition and guidance. After the bell Thursday, BlackRock \u2014 the largest asset manager in the world \u2014 filed for spot bitcoin ETF, with Coinbase as its crypto custodian.\n\n\"One of the big purposes bitcoin serves as an asset class is really diversification. It just has a different risk profile than traditional financial markets,\" Gustavo Schwenkler, associate professor at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University said. \"If this were to get approved, then I could anticipate a lot more institutional investors adding bitcoin to their investment to their portfolios \u2026 it would institutionalize the market in a way that is not possible right now.\"\n\nIf allowed to move forward, the iShares Bitcoin Trust would become the first approved ETF in the U.S. to track the price of bitcoin, versus the futures contracts tied to the cryptocurrency. It's been about 10 years since the first filing for a potential spot bitcoin ETF. Since then, every application that has gone through the SEC has been rejected.\n\nThe filing comes about a week after the SEC sued its crypto custody partner, Coinbase, for violating securities laws, leaving many questioning the timing of BlackRock's application.\n\n\"That apparent commitment to Coinbase is almost as important near term as their commitment to bitcoin is in the long term,\" said Mark Connors, head of research at 3iQ. \"It's a big deal.\"\n\n\u2014CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed reporting."

        "title": "Is Crypto Dead? - The Atlantic",
        "content": "Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed 13 charges against Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, accusing it of mishandling customer funds and a litany of other white-collar crimes. It also charged Coinbase, a public company and the biggest U.S. crypto business, with failing to register as a broker-dealer.\n\nThe government actions did not move the price of bitcoin much, nor did they crater Coinbase stock; traders and investors had been expecting the enforcement actions for months. And both firms vowed to fight the charges and remain operational. Binance \u201cshould not be the subject of an SEC enforcement action, let alone on an emergency basis,\u201d the firm said in a statement. \u201cWe are very confident in the way we run our business\u2014the same business we presented to the SEC in order for us to become a public company,\u201d Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, said in response.\n\nEven before the SEC announcements, crypto was in trouble. Dozens of firms had failed, millions of individual investors had plunged into the red or cashed out, and billions of dollars of institutional investment had moved on. Beset by long-standing problems of its own invention, the industry now faces not just a regulatory crisis but an existential one too: Is crypto down, or is it dead?\n\nIt is definitely down, written off by thousands of individual and institutional investors. The most obvious issue: scams. In the world of crypto, big firms are scams. Little firms are scams. Stable coins are scams; exchanges are scams; NFT schemes are scams; initial coin offerings are scams; tokens are scams. Firms run by self-proclaimed altruists are scams. Firms run by the shadiest dudes you can possibly imagine are scams. \u201cThere have been a lot of putatively decentralized Web3 companies that were really just three guys and a pair of servers in a pump-and-dump coin scheme,\u201d Will Wilkinson, the head of policy at TBD, a bitcoin-focused subsidiary of the fintech giant Block, told me. And even simple, legitimate crypto activity remains prone to fraud. Hackers purloined nearly $4 billion of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies last year alone, according to the research group Chainalysis.\n\nThe industry also has a complexity problem. Fourteen years since the advent of bitcoin, people still struggle to comprehend how the blockchain works, what Web3 is, and what tokens and coins and NFTs are. Many folks also struggle to figure out how to buy crypto assets and manage their investments. (Why do you need a weird series of letters and numbers to secure your bitcoin, again?)\n\n\u201cA mature market is one that shouldn\u2019t make you afraid to put your money in. You shouldn\u2019t be turning off a bunch of folks with greed and theft,\u201d Yesha Yadav, an expert in financial-market regulation at Vanderbilt University\u2019s law school, told me. \u201cEqually, it should be one in which folks feel comfortable in understanding the technicalities.\u201d\n\nWhat is the point of doing all of this, anyway? Boosters have for years described crypto as a revolutionary technology\u2014disempowering central banks, empowering private individuals, and perhaps even ushering in an era of world peace. But revolutionary for whom and in what way? That\u2019s hard to say. Most crypto users are just making speculative bets; most crypto firms are just making or facilitating speculative bets themselves. Crypto is a casino, for the most part, and one without the free drinks.\n\nThese digital assets are \u201cpretty much only good for illegal activities, like money laundering, narco-terrorism, and tax evasion,\u201d Dennis Kelleher, a co-founder of Better Markets, a nonprofit advocating for financial regulation, told me. \u201cIs there social or public interest in enabling a financial product like that?\u201d\n\nThen there are the volatility and the bubbles. Financial assets go up in price. They go down in price. This is their nature. But few things go up and down quite like crypto. NFTs came out of nowhere, sucked up billions of dollars, and collapsed. Initial coin offerings came out of nowhere, sucked up billions of dollars, and disappeared.\n\nEven bitcoin\u2014the most stalwart and liquid part of the industry\u2014still sees wild swings in price. Two years ago, the internet and the airwaves were awash with advertisements painting crypto as an investment for the brave, a down payment on the future. These ads targeted everyone, especially Black investors historically shunned by Main Street financial institutions. \u201cI want to ensure that communities like the one I come from are not left behind,\u201d LeBron James said, announcing a multiyear deal with Crypto.com. It was a pump-and-dump on a multibillion-dollar scale. \u201cDumb money\u201d got in to get smart money out. Black money got in to get white money out. The price of bitcoin quintupled. Then it crumbled.\n\nWealthy investors might be able to tolerate these kinds of losses. High-risk investors might be able to tolerate this kind of volatility. So too might crypto true believers, for whom HODL, or \u201cHold on for dear life,\u201d is a common refrain. But most people don\u2019t want to hold on for dear life.\n\nIf these were the only issues, the crypto winter might just be that\u2014a season. The price of bitcoin and ether would recover, as they already are. People would forget about the brazen frauds and the sweaty ads and the endless hacks. New businesses would start; new promises would be made; new money would flow in.\n\nBut for Uncle Sam. From the very beginning, many crypto businesses have been engaged in something called \u201cregulatory entrepreneurship.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cask forgiveness, not permission\u201d as a business model: Start-up founders create a company in probable violation of American law, argue that the law should not apply to them, grow \u201ctoo big to ban,\u201d lobby intensively, and hope for the best. It might sound delusional, but it\u2019s a common strategy in Silicon Valley, one that has worked out for Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, and DraftKings, among others.\n\nFor years, crypto companies argued that American financial regulations do not apply to them because, well, because. They pushed Congress to \u201cclarify\u201d the laws. And while Congress debated whether and how to do so, those firms allowed individual customers to buy, trade, and leverage their newfangled assets. Still, American financial companies abiding by American financial law largely avoided pouring money into or building products with crypto, because of the legal and regulatory risk. Goldman Sachs didn\u2019t start packaging ether into derivatives; Bank of America would not let you pay your mortgage in bitcoin.\n\nThis weird status quo protected the broader American financial system from the fraud and chaos of the crypto markets. But it left individual crypto investors exposed to that fraud and chaos. \u201cWhat makes my blood boil is the fact that actual people have been losing their shirts,\u201d Yadav told me, \u201cwhile we are over here stroking our chins about what exactly these asset classes represent.\u201d\n\nThe collapse in November of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Bahamian crypto mega-exchange-slash-alleged-Ponzi-scheme, did not destabilize the financial system. But it did kill off the chances of Congress passing crypto-friendly legislation. And while Congress delayed, debated, and walked away, the SEC forged ahead, insisting that most crypto assets are securities, arguing that crypto companies have failed to register their businesses and structure them properly, and promising to force them into compliance. Coinbase and Binance are just the biggest and latest companies targeted; there have been dozens of enforcement actions in the past few years.\n\nCrypto firms complain that this is innovation-stifling \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d: Congress needs to clarify the rules before the SEC can administer them. \u201cImagine if more than a century ago regulators had cut Ford and General Motors off from banking services because they considered automobiles too risky,\u201d Katie Haun, a prominent crypto investor, wrote in The Wall Street Journal in March. \u201cMajor U.S. policy decisions should be made by Congress and state legislatures, not by unelected officials.\u201d\n\nBut many financial experts argue that the SEC\u2019s authority is obvious. Most crypto assets are securities: \u201can investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others,\u201d as defined in a 1946 Supreme Court case. (Bitcoin, notably, is not a security: Nobody is profiting from the efforts of bitcoin\u2019s leadership, because bitcoin has no leaders.) \u201cThe SEC is trying to enforce the most basic investor protections we have,\u201d Kelleher told me. \u201cTruthfully, these are not aggressive cases. These aren\u2019t close calls.\u201d\n\nTo the crypto industry, they might be devastating, though. Many crypto firms do not have a business model that nets out if standard financial regulations apply\u2014that\u2019s the essence of regulatory entrepreneurship. Coinbase, the SEC alleges, is a jumble of conflicts of interest, one providing insufficient protections and disclosures to its customers and performing shoddy bookkeeping. Were it to restructure, it would likely be a smaller company with higher costs and narrower or even obliterated margins. (The company was profitable before the crypto collapse and is now operating in the red.) Binance is functionally a criminal enterprise, SEC Chair Gary Gensler argues\u2014\u201can extensive web of deception\u201d purposefully evading American law. (The SEC complaint includes a message that Binance\u2019s chief compliance officer sent to a colleague, making Gensler\u2019s case for him: \u201cWe are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro.\u201d)\n\nThe risks to those two firms mirror the risks to the crypto industry as a whole. \u201cIt seems like this is just the beginning,\u201d Edward Moya, a crypto analyst, wrote in a note to clients last week, adding that the \u201cregulatory hammer\u201d is swinging and predicting that traders would abandon positions, pull assets off exchanges, and dump speculative investments.\n\nDoes this mean crypto is dead? Yes and no. Crypto boosters\u2019 grandest vision\u2014of digital currencies changing everything, putting the Federal Reserve out of business, supplanting Wall Street and Main Street, and remaking the web as Web3\u2014does seem over. Crypto is a trillion-dollar global asset class. Crypto is also a fringe industry that is offshoring and shrinking and growing more fringe, not one innovating alongside and outcompeting Big Finance.\n\nBut bitcoin and the blockchain are going to stick around, the former a popular alternative investment and a preferred currency of criminals, the latter a curious general-use technology. \u201cThe potential is the same,\u201d Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, a crypto think tank and advocacy group, told me. Wilkinson, for his part, noted how helpful bitcoin had proved to be in getting money to people without access to strong and stable banking networks: human-rights activists in Ukraine, refugees fleeing climate disasters, families receiving remittances in Ghana and Kenya. Both said they believe the industry would benefit from having the scammy, scummy actors and cheap-and-easy money flushed out. \u201cSome of these projects are potentially revolutionary,\u201d Brito told me. \u201cBut I think a large portion of the ecosystem was completely cynical. That\u2019s not helpful.\u201d\n\nI am still not sure whether many crypto projects are useful, yet alone revolutionary. Surely some use cases are out there waiting to be discovered, but good luck to crypto companies trying to persuade Americans to adopt them going forward. A recent CNBC survey found that 8 percent of adults have a positive view of crypto. A recent Pew survey found that just 2 percent of adults familiar with crypto are \u201cextremely\u201d confident in its safety and reliability. The past two years of price crashes, Ponzi schemes, and stolen funds have not just soured the government on crypto. They have soured the public too."

        "title": "Bitcoin as a Hedge for Inflation \u2013 Is It Still a Good Option? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The financial landscape continues to be redefined by the advent of digital currencies, despite the skepticism of some investors. Among these new-age assets, Bitcoin \u2013 the world's leading cryptocurrency \u2013 emerges as an intriguing option for those seeking an inflation hedge.\n\nBitcoin's design, characterized by its fixed supply of 21 million coins, safeguards it from the inflationary pressures that traditional currencies succumb to. By nature, Bitcoin cannot undergo dilution through inflation - a compelling factor that makes it enticing to discerning investors. Moreover, the decentralized architecture of Bitcoin disentangles it from any form of manipulation or control by central banks and governments. This intrinsic freedom lends an additional layer of security to investors wary of government interventions.\n\nHowever, the unique design of Bitcoin doesn't guarantee its viability as an inflation hedge in every circumstance. It's crucial to note that the value of Bitcoin is primarily driven by market demand and supply, with no tangible asset backing it up. Thus, the price can be volatile, experiencing dramatic rises and falls over short periods, even more so than traditional investments. For example, between late 2017 and early 2018, Bitcoin's price swung from nearly $20,000 down to just above $3,000. This level of volatility poses a risk for investors who may need to liquidate their holdings in times of market stress.\n\nWhen using Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, one must also consider its relatively short history compared to traditional investment vehicles like gold. With just over a decade in existence, Bitcoin's performance in a diverse range of economic scenarios is not entirely known. Its behavior during inflationary periods, in particular, remains largely untested. Given that inflation tends to occur over long timeframes, Bitcoin's longevity and stability in such conditions are yet to be fully evaluated.\n\nThe regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies is another critical factor in assessing Bitcoin's feasibility as an inflation hedge. Despite gaining wider acceptance, cryptocurrencies are still subjected to legal and regulatory uncertainties across different jurisdictions. There have been instances where governments, including China and India, have restricted or banned the use of cryptocurrencies, impacting their value and liquidity.\n\nThese factors do not undermine Bitcoin's potential but reflect the complexities and risks that come with investing in it. When considering Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, it is advisable to incorporate it as part of a diversified portfolio. By spreading investments across a range of asset types, investors can leverage Bitcoin's potential benefits while mitigating its risks.\n\nFurthermore, it's essential to keep in mind that hedging against inflation is a long-term strategy. Therefore, patience and discipline are key. Although Bitcoin's price may experience dramatic fluctuations in the short term, its overall trajectory since inception suggests a positive trend. Yet, investing in Bitcoin should not be based solely on historical performance, but rather, on thorough research and understanding of the asset and the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin has potential as an inflation hedge due to its fixed supply and decentralized nature. However, the inherent volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and relatively short historical record compared to traditional hedges add a level of risk. Thus, a careful, well-researched approach and diversification are crucial when considering Bitcoin as part of an inflation-hedging strategy.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. and Nasdaq\u00ae is a registered trademark of Nasdaq, Inc.

        "content": "BlackRock\u2019s latest filing for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) trust will drive investors\u2019 confidence in Bitcoin and may even be \u201cthe best thing that could happen\u201d to BTC, according to some crypto industry observers \u2014 but others warn of a hidden cost.\n\nDuring an interview on June 16, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said the approval of BlackRock\u2019s ETF application would be \u201cthe best thing that could happen to $BTC.\u201d\n\n\u201cI say a Hail Mary every night that Larry Fink and @blackrock pull off a @bitcoin ETF,\" Novogratz said on the Fox News segment, according to a tweet by host Liz Claman.\n\nFun being on @LizClaman show!! And yes, @BlackRock getting a $BTC ETF through would be the best thing that could happen to $BTC. https://t.co/2fFBeB9eyo \u2014 Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) June 16, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrency analyst James Edwards of Finder.com \u2014 a financial product comparison website \u2014 told Cointelegraph that the timing of BlackRock\u2019s filing should provide \u201cconfidence\u201d in both Bitcoin as an asset and also Coinbase in its upcoming legal battle fight with the SEC:\n\n\u201cBlackRock\u2019s willingness to press on with a Bitcoin ETF at a time when the SEC is on a warpath against crypto is very telling. It shows confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s status as a commodity \u2014 rather than a security,\u201d he said, adding:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that BlackRock would push forward with an ETF of this nature without serious consultation with regulators and confidence in Bitcoin's future legal status.\u201d\n\nBlackRock\u2019s intention to use Coinbase Custody to control funds should also be seen as a massive confidence booster for Coinbase as it prepares its legal defense, Edwards explained.\n\nHe added that BlackRock \u2014 the world\u2019s largest asset manager \u2014 likely wouldn\u2019t partner with Coinbase had they not been \u201cconfident\u201d in Coinbase\u2019s legal position.\n\nThe downside\n\nOthers argue that the traditional investment giant's latest moves undermine the \"ethos\" of decentralized cryptocurrencies, or, that the company may find a way to profit from retail investors.\n\nInvestor Scott Melker explained in a June 16 interview that such an approval would be a disservice to crypto-native innovators who built the industry:\n\n\u201cAs good as this may be for institutional adoption of the space, it kind of violates the ethos, it is a bit of a dishonest push away from the people who built the industry in the United States.\u201d\n\nCinneamhain Ventures partner and Ethereum bull Adam Cochran believes that BlackRock will swoop in on the \u201cdiscounted coins\u201d of retail investors, a theory also shared by Melker.\n\nBlackrock ETF\u2026 https://t.co/3g77QNdAun \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) June 15, 2023\n\nSteven Lubka, a managing director at Swan Bitcoin, shared a similar view, predicting that BTC will reach $1 million, but few retail investors would reap the rewards because the bulk of BTC will be owned by BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and other ETF issuers.\n\nMelker added that Wall Street firms will continue to move into the space and that U.S. regulators will likely \u201cchoose them\u201d over incumbent platforms.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: A beginner's guide to exchange-traded funds\n\nARK Invest, Grayscale, Fidelity, Galaxy Digital, VanEck, Valkyrie Investments, NYDIG, SkyBridge and WisdomTree are among the other investment firms that have applied to the SEC for similar Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nSince the news was first reported, the price of BTC has increased 2.2% to $25,584 at the time of writing.\n\nInterestingly, the Fear & Greed Crypto Index increased from 41 to 47 \u2014 leaving the fear zone \u2014 following the news of BlackRock\u2019s filing.\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?"

        "title": "The Lightning Network: introduction to layer 2 solutions - Santander",
        "content": "A decentralised system to process high volumes of instantaneous micropayments and provides a solution to the scalability problem as it can support millions of transactions per second.\n\nA criticism related to Bitcoin is its inability to execute a high volume of transactions in a short time frame. Given that a block is added to the Bitcoin network every ten minutes and that the block size is limited, Bitcoin is only able to execute 5\u20137 transactions per second, whereas VISA executes more than 20,000 in the same time frame. The Lightning Network however is a solution to this problem.\n\nThe Lightning Network protocol was introduced by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja in a paper published in January 2016, and pointed to this protocol as the solution to Bitcoin's scalability problem. The Lightning Network is a Layer 2 communication and payment protocol built on Bitcoin blockchain. In other words, the Lightning Network is a decentralised network for high volumes of instantaneous micropayments, which would allow the user to make immediate transactions with very low fees. The solution allows transactions to be processed off-chain, taking the load off the main network and improving network scalability.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin adds transactions to blocks spaced approximately every ten minutes. Moreover, as blockchain networks gain popularity, the number of transactions is growing exponentially, which means an increase in demand for space in each block, thus driving up transaction costs. This issue of time and cost means that Bitcoin blockchain is essentially unviable for micropayments. Imagine waiting ten minutes at a coffee shop counter to confirm your coffee purchase.\n\nThe Lightning Network resolves these issues. Payments on this network do not require block confirmations and are therefore instantaneous. It also allows payments for small amounts, with much lower fees compared to those using blockchain validation. Another major advantage of this network is its scalability \u2013 as it can support millions of transactions per second. Ultimately, this network eliminates the risk of delegating custody to third parties.\n\nThe Lightning Network works somewhat differently to the blockchain network and operates through payment channels. Parties open a payment channel between each other by sending funds in an initial transaction to a multi-signature address, which is managed by both involved parties and requires the signatures of both these parties to create new transactions. This initial transaction is then propagated to blockchain and the channel is left open. To pay each other, the parties create transactions from the multi-signature address. Once all transactions still pending in the chain have finalised, off-chain transactions can then be performed. When the channel closes, the final balance is recorded in the blockchain.\n\nToday, several companies are at the forefront of Lightning Network development. Blockstream, Lightning Labs and Acinq are just some examples of startups offering their own Lightning Network solution in order to issue their own digital assets through their network and instantly execute cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nNot only are there new companies offering this service \u2013 increasingly more companies, which we could catalogue as traditional, are jumping on the bandwagon to implement their own payment systems. Here are some examples:\n\nShopify, an e-commerce company, has an agreement with Strike to receive payments (via the Lightning Network) in bitcoin, as well as US dollars, from customers around the world. They hope to use this technology to lower fees and streamline international transfers.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (a fast-food franchise) now accepts bitcoin in El Salvador through the Lightning Network. This has all been possible thanks to Stripe's association with Shopify, NCR and Blackhawk. As payments over Lightning Networks continue to grow, it is expected that more and more shops will accept bitcoin (BTC) micropayments.\n\nAt the sovereign level, El Salvador's use of the Lightning Network for remittances was one of the main reasons why the country incorporated Bitcoin as legal tender. Remittances are an important component of El Salvador's GDP, so the country wants to lower costs for receiving such payments.\n\nThis technology, however, has its disadvantages, namely:\n\nPayments can only be made to users who are connected to a payment channel, i.e., the user must be active and connected to the channel. By contrast, traditional cryptocurrency transactions are not affected by this limitation. The Lightning Network is a protocol that is still constantly developing. The fact that even its creators don't recommend using Lightning for transactions involving large sums of money is testament to this. The protocol limits the channel's liquidity for all cryptocurrencies supported by all parties. This is another situation that undermines high-value transactions, as it makes users to have to split their funds in order to have liquidity on normal blockchain and Lightning Networks.\n\nTo summarise, Lightning Networks pose a solution to a problem that not only affects the Bitcoin network (scalability), but also other cryptocurrencies and, what's more, it even has the potential to streamline and reduce costs for fiat-currency payments."

        "title": "Bitcoin in Cuba: Why some Cubans are adopting BTC to escape 'The Matrix' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin adoption could swell in Cuba, particularly if private businesses understand the upside to accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as currency. That\u2019s according to a Cuban businessperson and Bitcoin advocate, Erich Garcia Cruz.\n\nA recent emigrant to the United States, Cruz is a vocal proponent of Bitcoin adoption in Cuba. Cruz leads the remittance and money transfer services BitRemesas and QvaPay, and has been outspoken in supporting Cuban citizens using Bitcoin since 2020.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph as part of an upcoming documentary, Cruz explained that Cubans can use Bitcoin \u201cas a tool.\u201d\n\nPhoto of Erich and Joe during the interview. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nWhile some Cubans use Bitcoin as a store of value, a means of exchange or a remittance tool, ultimately, it\u2019s about getting \u201cout from the Matrix,\u201d he explained. Cruz referred to the country\u2019s centrally planned and officially communist economy.\n\nCuba has no independent press, while the historic United States trade embargo makes it very hard for Cubans to access U.S. products, services and even applications. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is money independent of the state, and has no leader or central party.\n\nCruz explained that during a visit to El Salvador in 2022, one of his friends asked, \u201cHow do you teach about Bitcoin in Cuba if Cuba is run by a communist party?\u201d Surely the party would be against Bitcoin?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the government doesn\u2019t know just how powerful Bitcoin is; they don\u2019t know, and they are just thinking I\u2019m teaching the people about coins in the casino, or if they are afraid of the hyper-Bitcoinization of the Cuban society.\u201d\n\nCruz hints that the government may already understand how Bitcoin works, and maybe, \u201cThey can bypass some sanctions worldwide\u201d using internet-based money.\n\nAdditionally, since 2021, the government has been warming up to cryptocurrencies, as private businesses can legally accept cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin for goods and services. Cruz explains that more and more private companies should accept cryptocurrency instead of the Cuban peso (CUP) or moneda libremente convertible (MLC) \u2014 freely convertible currency:\n\n\u201cIf you get paid with CUP or MLC, you are solving the customer\u2019s problem, but you are creating a problem for you because owners are saying that then or later they will try to convert the CLP or MLC into international currency.\u201d\n\nThe Cuban peso has devalued by more than 800% since its inception. If a Cuban bought Bitcoin at its all-time high of $69,000, they would still have more value in Bitcoin than pesos. Moreover, the MLC is a government-backed stablecoin used for purchases in state-run supermarkets. Cubans looking to save money typically do so in the U.S. dollar and, increasingly, Bitcoin.\n\nMLC price movement as compared to U.S. dollars and euros since 2015.\n\nCruz shares the example of his father, who bought a small amount of Bitcoin with his Cuban peso pension fund three years ago. The pension fund has dramatically lost value as the Cuban peso continues to devalue, while Bitcoin has not only retained but increased in purchasing power:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not financial advice, but it\u2019s better to store your value in Bitcoin than the CUP \u2014 a government-issued shitcoin.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, despite the huge currency devaluation, Bitcoin suffers from a bad reputation in Cuba. Cruz was scammed by a crypto project before learning what Bitcoin is:\n\n\u201cWe have no internet [in Cuba] until five years ago, and Bitcoin is 14 years old. The first contact with Bitcoin in our society was through scams.\u201d\n\nCuba has a highly educated population and university education is free; however, the island is sheltered from Western influences, and the internet is a relatively new tool. The internet, as Cruz points out, only began to penetrate the country in a meaningful way over the past five years.\n\nRelated: Cuba Bitcoin community hosts BTC-only meetup\n\nCruz\u2019s work, and that of the Cuban Bitcoin community, targets private businesses in Cuba, making it an area in which Bitcoin adoption could thrive:\n\n\u201cYou have to teach the people who have the power to embrace that solution. And that\u2019s the private sector. Okay? There is no law. There is no law that forbids the business from accepting Bitcoin. Not yet.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s interview will feature in an upcoming documentary about Bitcoin in Cuba.\n\nMagazine: Peter McCormack\u2019s Real Bedford Football Club puts Bitcoin on the map"

        "content": "Asset management BlackRock has a strong record in getting its products approved.\n\nIssuers seeking to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in the US have a terrible one.\n\nSuch a fund has never been permitted, as the SEC has cited fraud and manipulation in the underlying spot market among its concerns.\n\nDavid Hirsch, chief of the SEC enforcement division\u2019s crypto assets and cyber unit, said at a crypto conference Wednesday \u201cthere has not been an adequate system of surveillance\u201d in the spot bitcoin market comparable to trading on a registered exchange.\n\nStill, BlackRock proposed the launch of an iShares Bitcoin Trust Thursday, an ETF that would tap Coinbase as its bitcoin custodian.\n\nThe firm\u2019s decision to seek the launch of a spot bitcoin ETF could signal that BlackRock saw a window for approval, some industry watchers said, while others believe it could simply reflect wishful thinking.\n\nA BlackRock spokesperson declined to comment \u201cdue to regulatory filing restrictions.\u201d\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas said in a research note that BlackRock\u2019s record for ETF application approvals stands at roughly 575-1. The one denial was for a nontransparent ETF in 2014 \u2014 a controversial structure at the time that, unlike traditional ETFs, don\u2019t disclose their holdings daily.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pessimistic about the potential for a spot bitcoin ETF launch with Gary Gensler at the SEC\u2019s helm, but BlackRock likely didn\u2019t make the decision lightly and is used to working with regulators,\u201d Seyffart and Balchunas wrote.\n\nThe next step after the registration statement is a 19b-4 filing, which would start the approval-seeking process. That filing, which begins a 240-day clock for the SEC to approve the product (or not) could come in the next few weeks, the Bloomberg Intelligence analysts said.\n\nBig name\u2019s involvement a \u2018game-changer\u2019\n\nThe filing comes amid the SEC\u2019s apparent crackdown on the crypto industry.\n\nLast week, the agency took legal action by initiating lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, bringing various charges that included alleged unregistered securities violations.\n\nBut Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, called the filing a potential \u201cgame-changer,\u201d noting there isn\u2019t another asset manager in the world as well-connected to government officials and regulators as BlackRock.\n\n\u201cThe fact that BlackRock is filing now speaks volumes,\u201d Geraci told Blockworks. \u201cBlackRock typically isn\u2019t in the business of making unforced errors, and betting on a spot bitcoin ETF if they weren\u2019t confident in approval seems like an unnecessary gamble.\u201d\n\nProponents of spot bitcoin ETFs have said the SEC allowing crypto investments in a regulated way would protect investors who may try to invest in crypto outside the fund wrapper \u2014 an arena daunting to many, particularly after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.\n\nAccording to a statement from Matt Zhang, the founder and managing partner of crypto investment firm Hivemind, the approval of BlackRock\u2019s proposed spot bitcoin ETF would provide institutional investors with a proper way to get bitcoin exposure through a household name.\n\n\u201cThere is no better combination than BlackRock and Coinbase,\u201d he argued. \u201cThey will give family office investors confidence to use ETFs in crypto.\u201d\n\nRead more: Interest in crypto plummets among family offices, survey says\n\nAn April 2022 survey of 500 financial advisors by Nasdaq found that 72% would be more likely to invest client assets in crypto if a spot bitcoin ETF were offered in the US.\n\nMore recently, a survey in January by Bitwise and VettaFi found that 32% of financial professionals cited \u201clack of easily accessible investment vehicles like ETFs and mutual funds\u201d as a barrier to crypto allocation.\n\nRic Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals (DACFP), compared the SEC\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF denials to Prohibition, which he said chased people into speakeasies.\n\nDuring his conversation with the SEC\u2019s Hirsch at the DACFP Vision conference in Austin on Wednesday, he said that financial advisers and other investors would welcome the opportunity to access bitcoin exposure through a prominent financial brand, citing Merrill Lynch as an example.\n\nHirsch \u2014 noting he was sharing personal views that weren\u2019t necessarily those of the SEC \u2014 acknowledged there would likely be an upswing in adoption if such a large financial player got involved in the space.\n\n\u201cBut also you\u2019re going to have some people\u2026who were never going to go into a speakeasy, but as long as there\u2019s this brightly-lit pub, say maybe I\u2019ll go in there,\u201d the SEC leader said. \u201cTo the extent that bitcoin is subject to manipulation, you have some additional group of investors who are open to potentially more harm than they otherwise might have experienced.\u201d\n\nMaybe no big deal?\n\nGrayscale Investments launched a suit against the SEC last year for denying its planned conversion of its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. That case is ongoing, and a ruling is expected in the coming months.\n\nThough some said oral arguments in March suggested Grayscale could win the case, certain industry watchers noted a favorable ruling for the firm wouldn\u2019t necessarily open a clear path for spot bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nDave Nadig, financial futurist at VettaFi, said he isn\u2019t reading too much into the BlackRock filing and its timing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing new here, so at best this can be seen as jockeying for position in line on the belief that perhaps Grayscale wins its lawsuit,\u201d he said. \u201cHistorically, who the issuer is hasn\u2019t mattered all that much on who gets [to be] first on products like this.\u201d\n\nWhile spot bitcoin ETF applications go back a decade \u2014 the first being a 2013 attempt by the Winklevoss twins \u2014 only one other is active.\n\nArk Invest and 21Shares re-filed for their spot bitcoin ETF in April.\n\nSeyffart and Balchunas said BlackRock\u2019s filing Thursday could spur others who had previously tried to launch a bitcoin ETF \u2014 such as Bitwise, VanEck and Fidelity \u2014 to also re-file.\n\n\u201cI still think it\u2019s extraordinarily unlikely that a spot bitcoin ETF is trading in the US in this calendar year,\u201d Nadig said. \u201cAnd probably even in 2024.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Self-custody Bitcoin amount unmeasurable so far \u2014 Santiment exec - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "There is no way to measure the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) that is being sent to self-custody wallets so far, according to one industry executive.\n\nAmid the ongoing fear, uncertainty and doubt, or FUD, over lawsuits against major cryptocurrency exchanges, investors have been increasingly offloading their Bitcoin from crypto trading platforms.\n\nAs of mid-June, Bitcoin\u2019s exchange supply fell to its lowest level since February 2018, according to data from the crypto intelligence platform Santiment. The massive exchange outflows have been triggered by self-custody growth fueled by uncertainty around Binance and Coinbase, Santiment said.\n\nBTC supply on exchanges since June 2017. Source: Santiment\n\nThe growing self-custody trend has a massive impact on cryptocurrency markets, Santiment\u2019s head of marketing Brian Quinlivan told Cointelegraph on June 15.\n\nOne of the most notable results of self-custody is that it tends to decrease circulation, thereby reducing the market capitalization tracked by websites like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap.\n\n\u201cCirculation does tend to dry up as coins are moved off of exchanges,\u201d Quinlivan said, adding that the increasing self-custody trend has a downside in the form of stagnant coins.\n\n\u201cThis stagnancy can have a negative impact on market cap due to the lowered utility of the network as a whole,\u201d the exec noted, adding:\n\n\u201cHowever, as long as there is still a healthy amount of exchange activity, which there has been, this generally should be enough to cancel out the negative impact of this current phenomenon.\u201d\n\nQuinlivan stated that coins moving off exchanges have more of a long-term impact on markets. \u201cTraders sometimes assume that if a massive amount of tokens is suddenly moved off exchanges by whales, prices will immediately rise,\u201d he said, adding that the firm has seen that it was usually a much more gradual rise.\n\nThe Santiment executive noted that Bticoin\u2019s supply on exchange has plummeted from 16.1% on Black Thursday in March 2020 to 9.8% today. \u201cPrices are still up 283% during this time span,\u201d Quinlivan added.\n\nWhile the self-custody trend continues to expand, it\u2019s not quite possible to find out how much BTC is sitting on cold wallets, according to Quinlivan. He said:\n\n\u201cAssuming we have every exchange address in existence, which nobody does, then we would be able to measure precisely how much is moving to cold wallets at any given time just by subtracting out all of these known exchange addresses.\u201d\n\nThe executive went on to say that, for now, blockchain analysts can only give their best estimation.\n\n\u201cIt is why our exact number of 9.8% of BTC on exchanges may vary slightly compared to other data out there. The longer time goes on, though, the more accurate data we are able to capture,\u201d Quinlivan noted.\n\nRelated: Binance CEO CZ responds as data points to billions in exchange outflows\n\nThe news comes amid Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization continuing to shrink, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market cap since April 2023. Source: CoinGecko\n\nSince mid-April, Bitcoin\u2019s market value has dropped more than 15%, amounting to $494 billion at the time of writing. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the BTC market cap reached its highest point of $1.28 trillion in November 2021, when the BTC price hit an all-time high of $68,000."

        "content": "Yesterday BlackRock\u2019s iShares filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) after the asset manager unveiled a private Bitcoin Trust in August last year. Numerous spot Bitcoin ETF applications by various asset managers have been rejected by the SEC. The only Bitcoin ETFs that have been approved are linked to the futures markets.\n\nWe believe that BlackRock might have done enough to address the SEC\u2019s concerns about spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBased on previous ETF rejections, the SEC wants to see two things. Firstly, it wants the pricing to be linked to a regulated exchange, which for now would be a futures market. Secondly, it wants the futures exchange (CME) to have a surveillance sharing agreement with the ETF exchange, which is Nasdaq for the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThat surveillance agreement must already exist because the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF is listed on Nasdaq and based on CME Bitcoin futures.\n\nSo how can the futures market provide a price for a cash market? If the spot ETF uses the price used to settle futures when they mature. BlackRock plans to use the CF Benchmarks Index, created by a UK FCA-regulated firm. That same benchmark is used by the CME to settle Bitcoin futures.\n\nOther spot Bitcoin ETF rejections\n\nThe crux of the SEC\u2019s objections has related to the perception that cryptocurrency prices are manipulated.\n\nThe second iteration of the Ark/21Shares Bitcoin ETF application was rejected this January, though it\u2019s still trying. Ark\u2019s most recent application analyzed why Bitcoin prices are becoming more reliable.\n\nThe Ark ETF used the S&P Bitcoin Index for pricing which sounds pretty credible. In turn, the S&P index is based on data from the startup Lukka. It uses pricing from a dozen exchanges, including Binance and Bitfinex. Another rejected ETF, the VanEck spot Bitcoin ETF used the MVIS CryptoCompare Bitcoin Benchmark Rate. Both were trying to list on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nIn the case of Grayscale\u2019s failed attempt to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF, the pricing index is supplied by TradeBlock. Both Grayscale and TradeBlock are part of the Digital Currency Group.\n\nIn contrast, the CF Benchmarks Index in BlackRock\u2018s application uses half the number of exchanges compared to the S&P index. Those exchanges are Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, ItBit (Paxos), Kraken and LMAX.\n\nMeanwhile, the BlackRock ETF will use Coinbase Custody as custodian, and Coinbase as prime broker, extending its existing relationship with the crypto exchange. The question is whether Coinbase\u2019s role could hold up the ETF given the SEC is suing the exchange."

The trust tracks the performance of bitcoin, offering direct exposure to the price of the digital currency, according to the asset manager.\n\nCoinbase Custody will be used by BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust as its custodian, according to a filing with the SEC \u2013 building upon an already existing relationship between the two firms.\n\nIn August last year, BlackRock expanded its crypto offering through a partnership with Coinbase. The two firms created new access points for institutional crypto adoption through the connection of their Coinbase Prime and Aladdin platforms.\n\nIf the SEC was to approve BlackRock\u2019s filing, the launch of a spot bitcoin ETF by a large asset manager could help rebuild confidence in digital assets, which has been deflated by news including the collapse of FTX last year.\n\nRead more: Wild West in action: FTX\u2019s fall from grace\n\nIt is still unclear whether the SEC will approve BlackRock\u2019s filing. However, given that earlier this month, the regulator sued Coinbase alleging securities violations \u2013 as well as previous rejections for similar filings from other asset managers such as Grayscale \u2013 the SEC might exercise reluctance once again."

        "title": "Bitcoin edges up after slump, Ether little-changed, other top 10 tokens mixed - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin rose in Friday morning trading in Asia, after falling below US$25,000 overnight and overall posting a losing week, a trend mirrored by Ether. The rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed after finding little impetus from the U.S. Fed decision in the week to leave interest rates unchanged. Polygon\u2019s Matic token had the biggest decline in the top 10 amid sharp falls in altcoins since the U.S. regulator last week labeled many of them illegally issued financial securities.\n\nBumpy week\n\nBitcoin added 2.05% over the last 24 hours to US$25,573.56 at 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, but lost 3.83% in the last seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of about US$497 billion, slipped to US$24,797.17 at around 8:00 p.m. on Thursday, the lowest since March 16.\n\nEther traded little changed at US$1,665.73, up a slight 0.78%, but posting a weekly loss of 10.06%.\n\nSolana led gains among the top 10 tokens by market capitalization, rising 3% to US$14.88, but still down 21.58% for the past seven days. The Solana community on Twitter is throwing around the idea of a hard fork to avoid further scrutiny from U.S. regulators, but such an idea is not being discussed among Solana developers, according to Decrypt.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic was the biggest loser out of the top 10, dropping 4.06% to US$0.5952 to bring the week\u2019s loss to 24.06%.\n\nMost of the top 10 have been on a roller-coaster ride since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) filed lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance.US and Coinbase in the week of June 5. The SEC also named dozens of altcoins as financial securities, including Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB.\n\nThose four tokens combined had a market capitalization of US$57.5 billion as of Friday morning in Asia, which is a sharp 26.5% slump from the US$78.27 billion prior to the SEC\u2019s lawsuits.\n\n\u201cMany notable altcoins, such as Matic, were listed as securities in recent SEC lawsuits, so venture capital firms have been selling their altcoin holdings to capture the little liquidity left and lessen the blow to their portfolios,\u201d said Nick Ruck, the chief operating officer of blockchain venture studio ContentFi Lab, in a Telegram message to Forkast.\n\n\u201cInstitutions are managing portfolio risk and preparing for a continued downtrend amid less market liquidity and tighter regulations,\u201d he said.\n\nIn related moves, U.S.-based trading platform Robinhood delisted Cardano, Polygon and Solana, while the eToro platform halted user purchases of Polygon, Decentraland, Algorand and Dash \u2014 which were all named in the SEC\u2019s legal filings.\n\nThe crypto market seemed to find little relief in the move this week by the Federal Reserve to pause interest rate increases.\n\n\u201cThis pause, or skip seems to be a more tactical move, but the fight against inflation is not over yet,\u201d said Michiel Janssen, trader and analyst at crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, in an email statement shared with Forkast.\n\n\u201cFor crypto this means in the short term that there is less money flowing into the crypto markets. In the longer run, higher inflation and further problems in the banking sector can be a positive for crypto.\u201d\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap increased 1.21% to US$1.04 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 18.55% to US$37.82 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n\u201cGrails\u201d sales hit US$17 million\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index lost 1.39% to 2,884.87 in the 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 10.46% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT transactions fell 25.96% to US$18.58 million. Transaction on Ethereum, the leading NFT blockchain, dropped 10.50% to US$13.2 million.\n\nTransactions on the Bitcoin network, the second largest NFT blockchain, plunged 72.91% to US$1.12 million.\n\nOn Thursday, global auction house Sotheby\u2019s finished its second round of sales of NFTs from the \u201cGrails\u201d collection. \u201cGrails\u201d consists of non-fungible token (NFT) artwork that belongs to the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and its NFT-purchasing fund Starry Night Capital.\n\nSingapore-based Three Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund that once managed as much as US$10 billion, filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in July 2022, which protects assets of insolvent foreign debtors from U.S. creditors.\n\nIn February this year, Three Arrows Capital\u2019s U.S.-based liquidator Teneo said that it plans to sell NFTs owned by the company with an estimated value of US$22 million at the time of the bankruptcy filing.\n\nThe second auction brought in nearly US$11 million in sales, including Dmitri Cherniak\u2019s \u201cThe Goose\u201d or Ringers #879, which was sold for US$6.2 million alone. The collection has raised a running total of US$17 million in Sotheby\u2019s sales.\n\n\u201cWhile the NFT community is excited by today\u2019s major art sales from the Sotheby\u2019s auction, that isn\u2019t money that will flow back into NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cThese were seized NFTs from 3AC and that money will go to recouping losses.\u201d\n\nIn other transactions, the NFT staple Bored Ape Yacht Club topped sales by collection, selling US$1.11 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nMythos chain-powered DMarket game NFTs came second with US$899,694 in sales, with over 51,000 transactions in the past day.\n\nU.S. stock futures drop after Thursday rally\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures fell as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong after rallying during the regular trading day on Thursday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.15%, S&P 500 futures edged 0.21% lower and Nasdaq Futures lost 0.33%.\n\nThe Dow rose 1.26% on Thursday, S&P gained 1.22% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.15% as optimism grew that the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes are near the peak, according to Trading Economics.\n\nThe U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged at 5% to 5.25% after its meeting on Wednesday. The rate is at its highest since 2006 after ten consecutive hikes that started in March 2022 to slow the pace of inflation that surged to 40-year highs at one stage last year. The central bank warned of two more rate hikes by the end of 2023.\n\nThe European Central Bank raised its interest rates for the eighth consecutive time on Thursday, adding 25 basis points.\n\nThe next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for July 25 to 26.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 28.1% chance the Fed will leave rates as is at July\u2019s meeting, while 71.9% says the Fed will raise by 25 basis points.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "Proof-of-work coins that had a fair distribution at their launch are the most likely to avoid being labeled as securities by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to Bitcoin OG and educator Dan Held.\n\nLast week, the SEC sued Binance and Coinbase, accusing them of offering a number of altcoins as unregistered securities. As a result, many of the tokens mentioned in the lawsuit were delisted by major trading platforms, which tanked their prices.\n\nAccording to Held, Tokens that \u201chad fair or transparent launches,\u201d such as Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Monero (XMR), do not match the definition of a security that the SEC is following and are likely to avoid the current crackdown.\n\nRelated: SEC charges against Binance and Coinbase are terrible for DeFi\n\n\u201cIt definitely seems like the SEC has carved that out as something that they won\u2019t be going after,\u201d he said in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph.\n\nAccording to Held, the vast majority of the tokens classified as securities by the SEC in its lawsuit against Coinbase and Binance were proof-of-stake coins, or tokens with a pre-mined distribution, meaning they have more centralized ownership.\n\nHeld also said the current crackdown is mainly carried out by a single government entity, the SEC, which means the level of pressure on the industry is still far from reaching the maximum level.\n\nHeld also stated that only Bitcoin (BTC) and a few other decentralized cryptocurrencies would survive in the long run, as they are the only ones that can endure an all-out government attack.\n\nTo find out more about which cryptocurrencies can resist the ongoing SEC crackdown, watch the full video on our YouTube channel and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!"

        "content": "What happened\n\nSeveral cryptocurrencies and crypto stocks rose today after BlackRock (BLK -0.43%), the largest asset manager in the world, filed to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSince late afternoon yesterday, the price of Bitcoin traded 4.5% higher as of 3:42 p.m. ET today.

Cryptocurrencies have rallied this year on the belief that the Fed would soon be done with its aggressive rate-hiking.\n\nToday, though, investors seemed to overlook these concerns as BlackRock submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Bitcoin ETF, which would be the first spot crypto ETF if approved.\n\nDespite the plan's rejections in the past, some experts believe the proposal has a chance because BlackRock wants to enter a \"surveillance-sharing agreement,\" meaning it would share data about trading activity and their customers, in an effort to prevent market manipulation."

        "content": "BlackRock, which manages about US$10 trillion as the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, has filed to launch the first publicly traded spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S., even as regulators in the country file lawsuits against cryptocurrency platforms for alleged violations of securities laws.\n\nBlackRock said in a Thursday filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) it intends to launch the \u201ciShares Bitcoin Trust\u201d with Coinbase Custody Trust Co. as the custodian for the Bitcoin. The ETF, if approved, will be listed on Nasdaq.\n\nThe application comes after the SEC last week sued Coinbase and Binance.US., two of the industry\u2019s biggest crypto exchanges, for allegedly breaching securities rules. That adds to uncertainties the SEC will approve the ETF, given that a Coinbase unit would act as custodian for the product.\n\nEric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, tweeted Thursday that the BlackRock filing is a \u201cshocker.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no signs at all SEC willing to approve, but BlackRock is very connected so maybe they know something?\u201d Balchunas said.\n\nApproval of a spot-traded Bitcoin ETF in the world\u2019s biggest economy and largest financial market is seen by many investors as a stamp of approval for the digital currency and would likely unlock significant amounts of institutional investment in Bitcoin.\n\nChokepoint?\n\nHowever, some in the crypto industry reacted negatively to the BlackRock development, raising \u201cOperation Chokepoint\u201d theories that suggest governments and traditional finance aim to derail the industry because it poses a threat to their interests.\n\n\u201cIf BlackRock\u2019s spot ETF application gets approved, it is undeniable that Operation Chokepoint 2.0 was orchestrated to drive out crypto native companies and bring in large traditional firms that are buddy-buddy with the U.S. [government] to try and control Bitcoin [and] crypto,\u201d Will Clemente, co-founder of digital asset research firm Reflexivity Research, said Thursday on Twitter to his 683,700 followers.\n\nIn the SEC filing, BlackRock said: \u201cThe Shares are intended to constitute a simple means of making an investment similar to an investment in bitcoin rather than by acquiring, holding and trading bitcoin directly on a peer-to-peer or other basis or via a digital asset exchange,\u201d\n\nThe SEC has previously rejected similar applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs filed by Grayscale, WisdomTree and VanEck. In June 2022, Grayscale sued the SEC for rejecting its application, saying the regulator failed to apply consistent treatment to similar investment vehicles.\n\nThe securities regulator, however, has approved a number of Bitcoin futures-based ETFs.\n\nComplex\n\nTraditional retail exchanges and brokers, such as Robinhood and eToro, are \u201cnavigating complex terrain when venturing into crypto,\u201d Jeff Feng, co-founder of Sei Labs, the company behind the Sei trading blockchain, told Forkast via email.\n\n\u201cThe absence of explicit regulatory guidelines has caused setbacks, leading to some tokens being delisted resulting in crypto market volatility,\u201d said Feng, a former Goldman Sachs analyst. \u201cNonetheless, these teething issues are part of the broader industry\u2019s evolutionary process.\u201d\n\nBalchunas at Bloomberg added that the BlackRock filing lists the factors that could adversely affect the price of Bitcoin, and \u201cthey list the exchanges, which \u2018are largely unregulated and may be subject to manipulation\u2019 which is the SEC\u2019s issue with approving ETF.\u201d\n\nBitcoin gained 1.89% over the past 24 hours to trade at US$25,541 at 11:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has risen 54.5% so far this year, but is still far below its peak at around US$64,000 recorded in November 2021."

Discover SCENE\n\nIf you think something is out of the ordinary when one of the world\u2019s most prestigious financial institutions applies for a cryptocurrency investment product during a tough regulatory crackdown, you wouldn\u2019t be the only one.\n\nBlackRock, which manages $9.5 trillion in assets, rocked the crypto world yesterday when it applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Though the product is technically a trust, as several eagle-eyed observers on Crypto Twitter have pointed out, it is functionally the same as a true blue ETF, experts say.\n\nIt\u2019s the \u201creal deal,\u201d according to Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg Eric Balchunas, who defended the \u201cETF\u201d label yesterday on Twitter. Balchunas also pointed out that BlackRock is nearly undefeated when going up against the SEC, at 575-1, with nearly every single one of its ETF applications receiving the Commission\u2019s blessing. Other Bitcoin ETF applicants over the years can\u2019t say the same.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo all those saying the BlackRock filing is a trust and not an ETF. Do you consider $GLD to be an ETF? Well, this is same thing. Lot of structures under \u201cETF\u201d umbrella. Nothing like $GBTC. This is the real deal. pic.twitter.com/p75ZKHGxK0 \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 16, 2023\n\nMany investment firms have applied for a Bitcoin ETF since 2013, only to face rejection from Wall Street\u2019s top regulator\u2014which cites concerns about market manipulation as reasons for not allowing such a product to exist in the States. An ETF is an investment vehicle that tracks the value of an underlying asset, like gold, foreign currencies, or Bitcoin.\n\nAsset managers VanEck, Ark Invest, and Bitwise have all been rejected by the regulator. The issue is so contentious, Grayscale Investments last year hit the SEC with a lawsuit after it said \u201cno\u201d to its application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF.\n\nBut BlackRock\u2019s application is different\u2014and it comes at a strange time: The SEC this year has ramped up a fierce crackdown on the digital asset industry, hitting crypto firms with lawsuit after lawsuit and even hinting that the space isn\u2019t welcome on U.S. shores at all.\n\nBlackRock, though, is no ordinary investment manager\u2014it\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest. Not only that, it wants to work with Coinbase as a custodian (a company BlackRock has worked with before). The SEC last week sued the San Francisco-based exchange for allegedly offering and selling unregistered securities via its staking service.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI would say this is a total shocker,\u201d Balchunas told Decrypt, adding that BlackRock\u2019s move \u201chas definitely breathed new life into the whole Bitcoin ETF race and new optimism.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that although he hadn\u2019t seen anything that indicates that the SEC has changed its position, the fact that it was BlackRock applying makes this situation different.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s BlackRock\u2014it should give some hope, for sure,\u201d he said.\n\nBlackRock is a serious institution. And the application says that Bank of New York Mellon would be the custodian for the Trust\u2019s cash holdings\u2014another reputable financial institution. According to Balchunas, BlackRock has been very successful in the past with getting ETFs approved.\n\n\u201cBlackRock is just such an impressive, powerful, big, connected company,\u201d added Balchunas. \u201cAnd for them to see something here, I have to just sort of give them a lot of, I just give them a lot of respect. And so that's where I'm like, do they know something? What do they see?\u201d\n\nFun fact: BlackRock's record of getting ETFs approved by the SEC is 575-1. That's another reason this is so big, they don't play around. https://t.co/f7YIhGRmLf \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 16, 2023\n\nThe debate on Twitter as to how BlackRock\u2019s product, should it be approved, ought to be labeled is much ado about nothing, said Balchunas. He points out that the application states that the product would be grantor trust, which would make its structure similar to GLD Gold Trust, which everyone considers an ETF.\n\nBlackRock did not file for a bitcoin ETF. \u2014 Pomp \ud83c\udf2a (@APompliano) June 15, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can try to be technical, but we\u2019re okay with it just being called an ETF, because it really is in the spirit of the ETF or the structure. It really qualifies as an ETF,\u201d he said.\n\nIs BlackRock finally the one that brings Bitcoin to the big dance? The current regulatory environment may prove difficult to manage, but the Wall Street giant certainly has the best odds yet."

        "content": "BlackRock (BLK.N) is putting all the meat on the grill in its commitment to cryptocurrencies. The world\u2019s largest asset manager is seeking to launch the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nOn Thursday, the New York City-based company requested permission for the iShares Bitcoin Trust, according to an application filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), despite the fact that this asset class is under intense regulatory scrutiny. That, without counting the legal scrutiny of startups and consortiums that turned out to be a speculative and fraudulent business model for their clients (cof, cof, FTX, cof).\n\nAccording to Reuters, Coinbase would be the trustee of the fund\u2019s bitcoin usufructs. While Bank of New York Mellon would guard those of fiat currency. In this way, with a traditional model, the seriousness of the fund and its investments is guaranteed.\n\nIf approved, the Black Rock ETF would be listed on the Nasdaq and would trade as commodity-based fiat stocks.\n\nIt may interest you: La Haus sells its first property with Bitcoin in Mexico\n\nBlackRock\u2019s request comes at a complex time, as Coinbase, considered the largest cryptocurrency platform in the United States, has recently been sued by the SEC for operating without a traditional broker license.\n\nWhy is BlackRock\u2019s bet relevant for a private investment fund?\n\nBlackRock\u2019s proposed ETF takes proprietary price data from cryptocurrency exchanges that are held to the highest standards of market integrity and transparency. This frame of reference provides a background to assess the performance of startups that bet on Crypto in their value proposition.\n\nIt would protect investors, since the price of the products compared would be followed by the cash of the underlying asset. It is an excellent alternative to place capital and ensure returns backed by nothing less than BlackRock.\n\nThe credibility of the cryptocurrency had suffered from recent scandals, regulatory news, and some unfortunate statements from senior managers. So this would bet the development of private investment funds in the cryptocurrency market and accelerate them.\n\nWhy is this BlackRock bet relevant to startups?\n\nBitcoin is consolidated as the axis of a value proposition based on cryptocurrencies. It would reduce the risks of capital loss, since asset movements could be monitored in real time.\n\nETFs are recognized for their liquidity, this means that they can be bought and sold at any time.\n\nETFs standardize prices, this helps to reduce extremely volatile costs and uneven increases. This factor gives investors greater certainty and is a good argument to support your commitment to cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo read the information in detail, visit: Reuters"

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is trying its hand at potentially getting the first spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded fund launched in the US.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest asset manager on Thursday applied for the iShares Bitcoin Trust, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Coinbase Global Inc., the biggest crypto exchange in the US, would act as custodian. The ETF, should it launch, would trade on Nasdaq.\n\nRelated: A Bitcoin-Spot ETF Is Unlikely in US in the Near Future, VanEck CEO Says\n\nThere have been about 30 attempts for a spot-Bitcoin product, according to a tally from Bloomberg Intelligence. But applications have faced opposition by regulators, who have in the past cited market concerns and a lack of investor protections, among other things. The SEC, meanwhile, is suing Coinbase, alleging that it is running an illegal exchange. The company has said that a lack of clear rules for the digital-assets industry is hurting America\u2019s economic competitiveness.\n\n\u201cOne might say that they are about as good as it gets at reading the regulatory tea leaves,\u201d said James Seyffart at Bloomberg Intelligence, referencing BlackRock. The New York-based asset manager oversaw more than $9 trillion as of the end of March.\n\nRelated: Grayscale-SEC Fight Could Clear the Way for Anybody to Speculate on Bitcoin\n\nCryptocurrency backers have long argued that such a product should be made available for trading. The filing appears to have lifted the price of Bitcoin, which gained about 2.7% to around $25,620 on Thursday after the disclosure. The biggest digital asset by market value had touched $24,770 earlier, the lowest since March.\n\nThe filing was earlier partially reported by crypto-site CoinDesk.\n\n\u201cWe have filed a registration statement with the SEC, and due to regulatory filing restrictions, we are not able to provide further comment,\u201d a BlackRock spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s attempt at a spot Bitcoin ETF lands amid digital asset-manager Grayscale Investments LLC\u2019s high-profile legal battle with the SEC. Grayscale sued the regulator after it denied a bid to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a physically backed ETF, citing fraud and manipulation concerns related to the underlying market.\n\n\u201cPerhaps BlackRock is in agreement with us in Bloomberg Intelligence that Grayscale is going to win their lawsuit with the SEC and they want to make sure their hat is in the ring in the event of an approval,\u201d Seyffart said.\n\nBlackRock has prior dealings with the crypto space. The company had partnered with Coinbase on making it easier for institutional investors to manage and trade Bitcoin.\n\nLots of issuers have over the years filed for spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, though regulators have in the past been hesitant to green-light such a product. More recently, crypto exchange-traded-products issuer 21Shares, in partnership with Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Investment Management, refiled an application for a spot-Bitcoin ETF, arguing that such a fund would offer US investors protections that currently don\u2019t exist.\n\n--With assistance from Silla Brush."

There are plenty of great crypto exchanges to do it from, but why sign up for something new if you can get it from an app you already use, know, and love? Let\u2019s show you how to buy and sell Bitcoin on Cash App.\n\nQUICK ANSWER To buy Bitcoin on Cash App, launch the application and go to Money > Buy bitcoin > Buy. Select the amount you want to buy and hit Next. Take a look at the transaction details and select Confirm. You can also use Auto Invest or Custom Purchase Order, which we'll discuss later in this guide. If you want to sell your Bitcoin, launch Cash App and go to Money > Bitcoin > Sell.

JUMP TO KEY SECTIONS Who can buy Bitcoin on Cash App?\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nHow to sell Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nWhat are the fees for buying and selling Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nWarning: We are not financial advisors, and cannot tell you if investing in Bitcoin is a good or bad idea. Bitcoin is considered a high-risk asset and is susceptible to high fluctuations in value. Do your own research and make your own decisions before buying or selling Bitcoin.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: We used a Google Pixel 7 running Android 13 to develop these instructions. We also verified all steps using an Apple iPhone 12 Mini Running iOS 16.5 to ensure the steps are the same on iOS and Android. Remember that some menus may look slightly different depending on your device and software version. By the way, we had to use iPhone screenshots, as the Android app doesn\u2019t allow taking screenshots of key pages. The steps are identical, though.\n\nWho can buy Bitcoin on Cash App?\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nAnyone with a verified Cash App account should be able to invest in Bitcoin. You will need to live somewhere in the USA and be at least 18 years of age, or whatever is considered the age of majority in your State.\n\nAdditionally, different states require more information. You will definitely need to provide your personal information, though. This will include your name, address, birthday, and in many cases, your social security number. You might also need to verify your identity by taking pictures of your ID and face.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nOnce you have your account ready and verified, buying Bitcoin is super simple. You must know about the different types of Bitcoin purchases you can make on Cash App, though. There are three types of Bitcoin purchases. Let\u2019s talk about them before moving forward.\n\nBitcoin order types: Standard Order: Buy Bitcoin on spot, using the current price.\n\nBuy Bitcoin on spot, using the current price. Custom Purchase Order: Set a specific price for your order to be fulfilled.\n\nSet a specific price for your order to be fulfilled. Auto Invest: You can trigger automatic Bitcoin purchases daily, weekly, or bi-weekly.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin on Cash App: Launch Cash App. Tap on the Money tab. It looks like a bank building, or your balance, if you have any. Select the Buy bitcoin option. This will show up as Bitcoin if you already have Bitcoin. Tap on the Buy button. By default, the purchase will be a Standard Order. Tap on the Change Order Type option to switch to Custom Purchase Order or Auto Invest and follow the instructions. Ignore this step if you want to simply buy Bitcoin right away. Select how much, in dollars, you want to invest in Bitcoin. Then hit Next. Check the Bitcoin purchase details and hit Confirm. Select Done.\n\nCash App will finish the purchase, and you\u2019ll have your Bitcoin in your wallet. If you don\u2019t have enough money in your Cash App balance to cover the purchase, the app will pull the remaining funds from your linked debit card. This will be reflected in the purchase details, before confirming the transaction.\n\nHow to sell Bitcoin on Cash App Seling Bitcoin is just as easy as buying it! Let\u2019s show you how to cash out Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nHow to sell Bitcoin on Cash App: Launch Cash App. Tap on the Money tab. It looks like a bank building, or your balance, if you have any. Go into the Bitcoin option. Tap on the Sell button. By default, the purchase will be a Standard Order. Tap on the Change Order Type option to switch to a Custom Sell Order and follow the instructions. Ignore this step if you want to simply sell Bitcoin right away. Select how much, in dollars, you want to sell. Then hit Next. Check the Bitcoin sell details and hit Confirm. Select Done.\n\nYour money will go straight to your Cash App balance. You can use it for transfers, spend it on your Cash Card, or use the Cash Out feature to send it to your bank account.\n\nWhat are the fees for buying and selling Bitcoin on Cash App\n\nEdgar Cervantes / Android Authority\n\nNothing is free, especially in the world of crypto. Buying and selling Bitcoin on Cash App has a cost. That said, Cash App\u2019s fees are considered pretty fair compared to its main competitors. The bad news is Cash App isn\u2019t very clear about its Bitcoin fees.\n\nAs of the time of this writing, the fees start at about 3% for purchasing $1 of Bitcoin, and get reduced the more you purchase. For example, We checked how much the fees would be for purchasing $100, $1,000, and $10,000. These would be $2.25, $17.50, and $75.20, accordingly. This would mean you\u2019re paying 2.25% for buying $100, 1.75% for $1,000, or 0.75% for $10,000.\n\nOf course, these fees can change in the future. And you should also take into account that there is a margin, also known as spread, applied to the purchase. Exchanges compare prices across multiple exchanges and adjust the price accordingly. This is mostly to ensure the company doesn\u2019t lose money if the Bitcoin price changes during the time your transaction takes.\n\nFAQs\n\nCan you send Bitcoin from Cash App to another wallet? Yes! You can send the Bitcoin you have in your Cash App to any other Bitcoin wallet. We actually have a full guide on how to send Bitcoin on Cash App, if you need some help.\n\nIs Cash App a Bitcoin wallet? Cash App offers a Bitcoin wallet. More specifically, it is a custodian of your Bitcoin wallet. You just don\u2019t get access to your Bitcoin address private keys.\n\nWhat happens if I sell my Bitcoin on Cash App? When you sell your Bitcoin on Cash App, all the money will go straight to your balance in the app. You can then transfer it to other users, spend it using the Cash Card, or send it to your bank.\n\nIs buying Bitcoin on Cash App safe? Buying Bitcoin on Cash App is very safe. The company is well-established and regulated. You have to be careful of possible scammers trying to get you to send them BTC, but that applies to any crypto exchange. What may not be so safe is keeping your Bitcoin on Cash App. Most experts and enthusiasts suggest moving your Bitcoin to a cold wallet for long-term storage. This is because Cash App is a company that could go bankrupt, suffer from hacks, and more. And since Bitcoin is not regulated, it is not FDIC-insured or protected in any way.\n\nWhere is my Bitcoin address on Cash App? To find your Bitcoin address on Cash App, launch the app and go to Money > Bitcoin > Send or receive > Receive bitcoin. Tap on the QR code to see your addresses for the Bitcoin Network and Lightning Network.\n\nComments"

Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nA Twitter user, citing data from on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, said that Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day correlation coefficient with popular indices like Nasdaq and S&P 500 turned negative. In essence, this meant that when the price of BTC goes up, the price of the equities will fall and vice versa.\n\n? Look out folks, something's changing! Stocks and crypto are now mostly negatively correlated, meaning as one thrives, the other dives. Data from @intotheblock https://t.co/THDanxmnii pic.twitter.com/lXl7eHOhvt \u2014 Elite ?? (@eliteXBT) June 16, 2023\n\n\u201cDigital gold\u201d is finally here\n\nProponents of Bitcoin have long positioned it as the \u201csafe-haven asset,\u201d or an investment whose value is expected to be steady or even rise during economic downturns, similar to precious metals like Gold.\n\nTo be seen as an inflation hedge by investors, an asset must display significant decoupling from traditional markets. However, with the growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and other altcoins became more and more influenced by the geo-political and macroeconomic triggers that affect the mainstream market.\n\nBut this has started to change. The spate of banking collapses in March led investors to put their funds in the crypto market. Following this, the world\u2019s largest crypto by market cap, Bitcoin soared 52% until hitting its yearly peak in April, as per IntoTheBlock. On the other hand, equity indices were largely flat until that point.\n\nThe decoupling became even more pronounced in Q2 2023, as the crypto market in general and Bitcoin in particular entered a consolidation phase. The king coin fell even more as regulators in the United States became increasingly hostile.\n\nHowever, the tech stocks went the other way, resulting in a clear divergence in the growth trajectories of the two assets.\n\nIt\u2019s not only the equity markets with which BTC started to insulate itself. In recent months, the \u201cdigital gold\u201d has shown increased decoupling from its real-world counterpart, Gold [XAU] as well. Bitcoin grew faster in value than the precious metal since the banking crisis of March.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nVolatility starts to rise\n\nBTC exchanged hands at $26,561.18 at the time of writing. The coin gained nearly 4% in the last 24 hours, as per Santiment. Interestingly, after witnessing a protracted period of low volatility, BTC began to live up to its image of an unpredictable asset lately. The volatility increased following the recent legal actions on crypto behemoths by regulators."

        "content": "Shubham Dhage / Unsplash\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum and a slew of other major crypto currencies fell sharply this week as both inflation and the lawsuits being faced by Binance and Coinbase weighed heavily on investor sentiment. However, towards the end of the week, investors began to feel slightly more positive. This week, the price of BTC and ETH have fallen by 1.3% and 4.5% respectively \u2013 with many alt coins falling by significantly more. The total market cap of the crypto sector has fallen by 6% over the past week, with its value now teetering on the edge of sub-$1tn.\n\nA combination of macroeconomic headwinds and a renewed regulatory crackdown seems to have brought the crypto bears back out in force, with liquidity beginning to dry up. Bitcoin, the indicator-species for the health of the crypto sector, is now sitting at a price of around $25,576, with some analysts suggesting that the price of BTC could end up somewhere in the range of $23,500 before long.\n\nThe tokens which were named as securities in the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase, including Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) have been most significantly affected, dropping by 30% and 28.5% respectively since the beginning of the month. And after a promising start to the year for the crypto sector, the macro trend is beginning to show a flip towards the other direction. Investors will be wondering whether this can be considered a bump in the road or an indication of the sector\u2019s performance for the remainder of the year.\n\n(About Bitcoin)\n\nBitcoin is the original decentralized digital currency that was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, meaning that transactions can occur directly between users without the need for intermediaries like banks. Bitcoin uses cryptography to secure transactions and to control the creation of new units of the currency. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, which allows anyone to verify the validity of a transaction and the ownership of bitcoins. The total supply of bitcoins is limited to 21 million, which is expected to be reached around the year 2140. Bitcoin's price is highly volatile, and it has experienced numerous boom and bust cycles over the years."

        "content": "https://deceleration.news/wp-content/uploads/speaker/post-36928.mp3?cb=1686923345.mp3 Listen to this story\n\nAlexa Neuendorf, Kimberlee Walter, Jackie Sawicky, and Monica Vickery protest the arrival of bitcoin mining in Navarro County, Texas. Image: John Blewitt\n\nThe Texas Lege\u2019s failure to restrain energy-demanding bitcoin mining in Texas means the industry will continue to expand alongside record-setting grid strain, extreme climate disasters, water stress, and rising consumer energy costs.\n\nSecond thoughts, anyone?\n\nPaul Krantz\n\nAll is not well in rural Corsicana, Texas. The city and surrounding county have fallen into a state of disrepair, according to local resident Jackie Sawicky.\n\n\u201cOur roads are terrible, this week we were having brownouts, and as of this minute, my water is out,\u201d Sawicky told Deceleration. \u201cOur infrastructure is absolutely on the brink of failure\u2026and what are they doing? They\u2019re going to bring in the world\u2019s largest bitcoin mine.\u201d\n\nA recent report from the American Society of Civil Engineers supports Sawicky\u2019s observations, grading Texas overall with barely passing marks for the state of its roadways, wastewater systems, and levees and dams.\n\nSawicky\n\nConcerned about social and environmental impacts, Sawicky founded the Texas Coalition Against Bitcoin Mining and launched an online petition warning about noise pollution, rising water and energy costs, and more. At the time of this writing has garnered 1,180 signatures from residents opposing what is expected to be the state\u2019s largest bitcoin mine to date.\n\n\u201cWe do not want the increase in environmental temperature in the immediate vicinity of the factory-that-produces-nothing,\u201d the petition reads.\n\nFaced with escalating extreme weather due to climate change, Texas needs to upgrade infrastructure and transition away from fossil fuel use. The urgency of this need was felt keenly in 2021 when winter storm Uri cut power to millions across Texas for days on end and claimed hundreds of lives. Yet efforts intended to make the state more energy efficient withered during the last session of the Texas Legislature as lobbyists for environmental and traditional energy interests spent much of the session playing defense against bills seeking to kill renewable power and directing billions of dollars of tax revenue toward new, unnecessary gas-fueled power plants (See: \u201cGarbage In, Garbage Out\u201c).\n\nAs the state struggles to keep up with the energy demands driven by rapid population growth and rising temperatures, bitcoin mining continues to add further demand to the system, encouraged along by elected Republican leadership.\n\nGrowth of bitcoin mining globally represented by computing power employed. Source: Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index\n\nPower Use\n\nAccording to a report by the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state\u2019s electric grid manager, crypto mining consumed more than 3,300 Gigawatt/hours of Texas grid energy in 2022, more than double the amount used 2021.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s total energy consumption in Texas is only increasing. Further mining projects amounting to 39 gigawatts in demand are proposed by 2027, with at least 2.5 gigawatts already approved and 6 gigawatts more that have met planning requirements.\n\nThe daily energy demand for all of Texas is currently about 80 gigawatts.\n\nIf only the bitcoin projects that have already met planning requirements are approved, mining for digital currencies could increase energy demand on the grid by 10 percent within four years.\n\nA statement released by the grid manager said, \u201cERCOT will not allow the interconnection of load that would be expected to result in any violation of reliability criteria.\u201d\n\nAs opposed to other energy intensive industries, none of these projects offer tangible value to most Texas residents.\n\nRiot Platforms (formerly Riot Blockchain), is the company planning to bring an industrial bitcoin mine to Corsicana, potentially \u201cthe first one gigawatt load ever approved by ERCOT.\u201d Riot already operates a 450-megawatt facility near Rockdale, Texas, reportedly the largest single bitcoin mine in North America. One megawatt of electricity powers about 200 Texas homes during periods of peak demand, according to ERCOT. So Riot\u2019s new gigawatt plant, at peak capacity, could consume as much power as 200,000 Texas homes.\n\nRiot failed to respond to requests for comment from Deceleration.\n\nTo \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin, computers solve complex math equations (up to trillions per second) to identify a series of numbers that validates the next block on the blockchain. A miner is rewarded for solving the block with bitcoin currency. Due to the ever-increasing difficulty of solving these equations, the amount of energy required to power the network has exploded to exorbitant levels.\n\nThe Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) monitors bitcoin\u2019s global electricity demand. At time of writing, it estimates that the global bitcoin network is using at 144 terra-watt hours (Twh) annually. To put that number in perspective, gold mining is estimated to use 131 TWh worldwide and data centers were estimated to use 200 TWh as of 2018. The CBECI\u2019s estimates that the bitcoin network currently pollutes more than the country of Austria, about 71.5 million tons of CO2 per year.\n\nThe New York Times found that the two bitcoin mines in Rockdale consume more energy than all of the homes in a 40-mile radius.\n\nBitcoin advocates highlight projects powered by renewable energy, such as one of Marathon Digital Holding\u2019s mines near McCamey, Texas, which draws power from a wind farm. But many mining projects draw electricity directly from the grid, a mix of power sources that averages out to include roughly 60 percent of electrons derived from combusting coal and gas; still others are directly attached to fossil fuel power plants. Before constructing the mine in McCamey, Marathon cut a deal with a coal plant that was due to close and kept it operating for months longer.\n\nBeside energy, water is also a crucial resource for crypto mining. It\u2019s needed to cool the computers, and in a hot Texas summer that can amount to millions of gallons per day. Navarro Mills Lake, which is to be the primary source for Riot\u2019s planned facility, was in stage one drought this January and stressed in recent years.\n\n\u201cLast year, a record number of cattle ranchers had to sell their herds early because the drought was so bad that it was spiking the cost of hay and they couldn\u2019t afford to feed their cattle,\u201d Sawicky said.\n\nCorsicana residents will also be subjected to the unending drone of thousands of mining computers buzzing. The sound of one mine built in a rural town has been described as \u201ca small jet that never leaves.\u201d\n\nSound of bitcoin mining in Tennessee. Credit: WJHL\n\n\u2018Freedom Money\u2019\n\nPierre Rochard, VP of Research at Riot Platforms, told members of the Texas Senate Committee on Business and Commerce that bitcoin brings jobs to Texas, and called bitcoin \u201cfreedom money.\u201d\n\nLee Bratcher, president of the bitcoin lobbying group Texas Blockchain Council, said in the same hearing that bitcoin miners in Texas employ around 2,000 ongoing employees, and have employed around 20,000 contractors. Out of nearly 15 million workers in Texas, those are not big numbers. Once bitcoin mining centers are built, they require a very slim workforce to maintain. Bratcher also declined to comment for this article.\n\nERCOT classifies bitcoin mines as \u201clarge flexible loads,\u201d because they draw a lot of power and are able to power down or reduce their energy use quickly. Bigger bitcoin mines typically have a curtailment clause in their energy contracts with ERCOT, meaning they agree to power down during moments of emergency energy demand.\n\nBitcoin miners have a business incentive to power down when demand spikes and energy prices go up, but by participating in \u201cresponsive reserve service\u201d with ERCOT, miners collect energy credits for energy they don\u2019t use.\n\nRiot, for instance, reported $9.5 million in energy credits from the state last July for powering down during a heatwave, and a total of $27.3 million in energy credit payouts that year, according to a recent earnings report.\n\nRecently, proposed Texas Senate Bill 1751, sponsored by state senators Kolkhorst, Campbell, and Nichols aimed to stop bitcoin miners from gaining ERCOT energy credits. The bill passed the Senate, but failed to make it to the voting floor of the House.\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsors said it was not a punitive measure, but meant to eliminate unnecessary incentives for a rapidly growing industry. Bitcoin miners celebrated the death of what they called the \u201canti-mining\u201d bill when they learned it would not make it to the Governor\u2019s desk.\n\nWind turbines outside McCamey, Texas, close to a Marathon Digital Holding bitcoin mine. Image: Greg Harman\n\nCan Bitcoin Be Tamed?\n\nThe too often ignored reality of mitigating climate change is that humankind needs to reduce energy and resource use overall. To merely swap today\u2019s fossil power for a renewable grid would lead to further constraints and environmentally devastating impacts. The challenge is in maintaining good living standards while reducing energy demand. Doing so requires rethinking virtually every aspect of society, including \u201clow-energy housing, widespread public transport, and diets low in animal-based foods,\u201d one recent assessment found. It\u2019s safe to say that bitcoin\u2019s terawatts don\u2019t fit within the proposed framework.\n\nTake a bird's-eye view of our #Bitcoin mining operations in McCamey, TX. This is one of the four quadrants that make up the site. In total, there are over 60,000 miners at the site, working together to secure the Bitcoin network. pic.twitter.com/jIUZrRCbYv \u2014 Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) (@MarathonDH) April 25, 2023\n\nEven for those who believe in the importance of alternatives to fiat currency, there are options beside bitcoin with a significantly lower energy impact. The second most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum, cut network greenhouse gas emissions 99% last year by switching from a Proof-of-Work algorithm to Proof-of-Stake. Proof-of-stake is an alternative model for maintaining a cryptocurrency that doesn\u2019t require mining.\n\nEnergy and water commitments now being captured by bitcoin could edge out alternative projects more capable of helping Texas navigate the energy transition, like green hydrogen fuel production, in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cElectrolyzers\u2026store energy in the form of hydrogen that can then be used for other applications, such as transport, industrial uses, or more simply to reuse it for power plants,\u201d Olivier Beaufils, Market Lead for ERCOT at Aurora Energy Research, told Deceleration.\n\n\u201cA lot of these hydrogen projects are still in early stages,\u201d Beaufils said, noting that competition with other users hasn\u2019t manifested yet. \u201cNow three to five years ahead, that might be a different story.\u201d\n\nCharlie Schumacher, Marathon\u2019s corporate communications VP, said that bitcoin miners help rural renewables stay profitable and \u201csoak up\u201d electricity that may not reach users otherwise. But Adrian Shelley, Texas director of the advocacy organization Public Citizen, contends that bitcoin mining is not a viable solution to transmission issues.\n\n\u201cYou may have a glut of wind energy over here that, within a couple of years, ERCOT sees and invests in transmission that brings more of it to people where it\u2019s needed,\u201d Shelley said. \u201cBut if you mine bitcoin, ERCOT will never see that constraint, and is never going to make the investment.\u201d\n\nMolly White, who has a Harvard University fellowship to research crypto and publishes a blog called Web3 is going great, cautions against taking pro-bitcoin claims at face value.\n\n\u201cBitcoin miners\u2019 claims are pretty nakedly self-serving,\u201d White told Deceleration. She added that the more computers mine bitcoin, the more difficult mining becomes, increasing power use for the network overall. \u201cSo even [miners] using so-called waste energy from renewables are still contributing to the overall energy footprint of Bitcoin\u2026 much of which is not renewable.\u201d\n\nHow ERCOT and political leaders prioritize these projects will have a tremendous impact on the state\u2019s energy grid.\n\nBut for now, a pro-bitcoin lobby has gained influence in Texas. Governor Gregory Abbott has previously hosted the Texas Blockchain Council at the governor\u2019s mansion, and Senator Ted Cruz has openly supported the currency. Also, former Interim President and CEO of ERCOT, Brad Jones, became the first member of Riot\u2019s advisory board this year.\n\nTexas\u2019s 88th legislative session confirmed that the state\u2019s bitcoin mining industry will continue to be propped up by incentives. Three bills that passed are being celebrated by bitcoin miners, including HB 591 which will introduce tax incentives for powering crypto mining with flared gas.\n\nIn adding further tax incentives, and failing to cut existing ones, the state legislature appears to have sent a clear signal that Texas is open for bitcoin business, and the expanding peak energy demands that it entails.\n\nWhile bitcoin miners continue to profit from access to cheap energy and tax breaks, residents of communities across Texas will continue to experience increasing energy bills and the continued risk of power outages in yet another summer of record-breaking energy demands.\n\n\u201cWhen I go grocery shopping, I ask people, \u2018have you heard about the bitcoin mine?\u2019 said Jackie Sawicky. \u201cI have talked to hundreds of people in Corsicana and Navarro County, and I can count on both hands the people who have shown positive favor.\u201d\n\nFor the residents of Corsicana, it looks like a very noisy, thirsty and power hungry neighbor is coming to town.\n\n-30-\n\nPaul Krantz is an independent journalist with a keen interest in human impacts on the environment.

        "content": "Bitcoin prices rise despite traders taking short positions.\n\nBTC options expiry, bullish sentiment, and market volatility impact Bitcoin\u2019s performance.\n\nBitcoin has experienced notable volatility in recent times, driving many traders to hold short positions against the cryptocurrency. However, despite this, BTC\u2019s prices have started to rise again, potentially favoring bullish sentiment.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nBulls vs Bears\n\nAccording to CryptoQuant founder and analyst Kim Young Ju, the surge in BTC prices over the past few days has primarily been driven by direct purchases of Bitcoin through perpetual swaps, a type of derivative contract. Nevertheless, it appears that short positions taken by bears have not been liquidated at this point.\n\n#Bitcoin short squeeze hasn't happened. Most perpetual swap buying volume came from pure $BTC purchases, not forced short liquidations. More bullets for bulls.https://t.co/gkt9JiizM3 pic.twitter.com/xxYbi0DmvD \u2014 Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) June 16, 2023\n\nThis suggests that the current rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price may not have been substantial enough to trigger the closure of short positions, or that short sellers are still holding onto their positions despite the potential losses incurred.\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s price continues to climb, these lingering short positions may eventually get liquidated, resulting in a short squeeze scenario. A short squeeze occurs when the price of an asset sharply rises, forcing short sellers to cover their positions by buying back the asset. This buying pressure can amplify the price surge, triggering further short-covering and potentially significant price spikes.\n\nTraders \u201cPut\u201d their chips in one basket\n\nRecent data from GreeksLive highlights that approximately 25,000 BTC options are set to expire soon. The Put Call Ratio, standing at 0.73, indicates a higher number of bullish positions in the market.\n\nThe maximum pain point, at $26,000, represents the price level where option holders would face the most significant financial loss. The total notional value of these options amounts to $650 million, reflecting the underlying value of BTC options contracts.\n\nFurthermore, market data reveals that the withdrawal of market makers and reduced liquidity has heightened the risk of recent price fluctuations. However, this situation also presents a unique opportunity for investors.\n\nCurrently, buyers are benefitting from low implied volatilities (IVs) in various significant terms, offering favorable value for their investments. Notably, large whales and institutions are actively engaging in the purchase of options, demonstrating confidence in the market.\n\nIs your portfolio green?
