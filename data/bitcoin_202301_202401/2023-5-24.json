Ether lost about the same amount and was trading at $1,787.17.\n\nThe move coincided with a drop in U.S. equities. The Dow was down nearly 300 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell about 1% each.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said debt ceiling talks are still hung up on spending levels \u2014 with eight days to go until the U.S. is at risk of a default. He also said he believes the negotiating teams could make progress Wednesday.\n\n\"Markets opened quite down after being down significantly yesterday, so this could be a reaction to that,\" said David Wells, CEO at Enclave Markets. \"Even though crypto is a global market, volumes pick up quite a bit during U.S. trading hours, so sometimes big crypto moves are following big equities moves that are macro driven.\"\n\nAs investors monitor the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations in Washington and Fed officials divided on where to go with interest rate hikes, bitcoin has started behaving like a risk asset again, just as it was starting to trade more in tandem with gold earlier this year.\n\nBitcoin and ether are on pace for their worst month of 2023, down 10% and almost 6%, respectively. Bitcoin is down more than 7% for the quarter, after finishing the first quarter up 71%. Ether is down 1.8%, after it posted a 52% gain in Q1."

        "title": "Crypto, the Fed and the debt ceiling: Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are falling today - USA TODAY",
        "content": "Bram Berkowitz\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nWhat happened with cryptocurrencies today?\n\nSeveral of the largest cryptocurrencies fell today in what appeared to be a move driven by macro fears, uncertainty about the debt ceiling, and ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve's May meeting minutes today.\n\nSince late afternoon yesterday, the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) traded 3% lower as of 11:45 a.m. ET today. Meanwhile, the price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) traded 3.2% lower, while the price of Litecoin (CRYPTO: LTC) was down 5.3%.\n\nSo what\n\nPart of what's been dogging cryptocurrencies today is the constant tug-of-war investors are having about their view on the Fed and interest rates and whether on not the Fed will pause its rate-hiking campaign at its next meeting. Currently, roughly 72% of investors are betting on a pause but that's a smaller percentage than it had been recently.\n\nFast-rising interest rates over the last year have crushed the likes of crypto and Bitcoin because they make riskier assets less appealing. Crypto has rallied this year largely on the belief that the Fed is preparing to end its rate-hiking campaign.\n\nWill they raise them again?Powell says Fed interest rates may not need to rise as much amid banking stress\n\nInflation has slowed a good amount this year but is still far away from the Fed's 2% target and the job market still looks extremely strong, which has investors questioning whether or not the Fed has seen enough data to end its rate-hiking campaign.\n\n\"Most developed markets are grappling with a shared problem. Core inflation is proving more stubborn than expected and remains well above central banks' 2 per cent targets,\" BlackRock analysts wrote in a recent research note. \"We think that means central banks can't undo any of their inflation-fighting rate hikes any time soon, even if financial markets think the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates before the end of the year.\"\n\nOn top of all of this, U.S. lawmakers still haven't reached an agreement to raise the debt ceiling, and the June 1 deadline when the U.S. could potentially default on its debt is rapidly approaching. Treasury yields have risen as a result of the uncertainty, which usually leads investors to take a risk-off approach.\n\nNow what\n\nCryptocurrencies have been rising all year on the belief that a Fed pause is near, but now investors are less sure that a pause and the rate cuts the market had been pricing in will actually materialize.\n\nAt 2 p.m. ET today, the Fed will release the minutes from its meeting earlier this month, which could shed light on whether or not the Fed will pause rates at its June meeting. The fact that we still don't have an agreement to raise the debt ceiling is concerning, but I'm hopeful lawmakers will eventually come to their senses. Cryptocurrencies tend to do well when the traditional financial system struggles, but if the U.S. defaults on its debt it's hard to know exactly what would happen.\n\nWhat happens if the US defaults?What you need to know as the debt ceiling deadline nears.\n\nI continue to believe Bitcoin and Ethereum are here to stay long term and like them as long-term investments. I own a little bit of Litecoin and there's talk that the altcoin may benefit from its upcoming halving event, but I really prefer Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBram Berkowitz has positions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

        "content": "Bitcoin may be the most widely recognized name in crypto, but its chief rival Ethereum has cornered a bigger share of the recent innovation in digital assets, whether it\u2019s nonfungible tokens or decentralized finance apps. That\u2019s because Ethereum\u2019s underlying software is seen as more versatile and better able to handle bursts of activity without getting clogged up and slowing down. Now Bitcoin finds itself playing host to crypto\u2019s latest speculative frenzy, a frog-branded \u201cmemecoin\u201d called Pepe, putting the original crypto network\u2019s technology under strain.\n\n1. What are memecoins?\n\nMemecoins are digital tokens depicted with an image \u2014 often an animated character or animal \u2014 that can quickly gain notoriety and soar in value. Although they have little practical use, they can draw an exuberant community of followers who hoard or trade them. (The name takes its cue from so-called meme stocks, such as Gamestop Corp., that were seized upon by retail traders during the pandemic and driven to stratospheric valuations based on social media chatter.) There are hundreds of memecoins, some worth almost nothing, others with market values of $100 million or more. Investors often leap upon a newly minted memecoin when it starts trading on a digital exchange such as Coinbase or Robinhood. Others pile in after them for fear of missing out. One famous memecoin, Dogecoin, ascended to stardom when Elon Musk tweeted memes based on the coin, which inspired a number of dog-themed memecoins such as Shiba Inu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. What happened this time?\n\nMore than 420 trillion frog-themed memecoins known as Pepe were created in little more than a month. The token was obsessively promoted on Twitter before and after its launch in April and soared to a market value of more than $1 billion in May before reversing course and plummeting more than 60% in the following days, according to data tracker CoinMarketCap.\n\n3. So another memecoin roller-coaster \u2014 what\u2019s new?\n\nShare this article Share\n\nMost memecoins were created and trade on Ethereum. Pepe is one of several that were minted not just on Ethereum but also on the Bitcoin system, using something known as the Ordinals protocol. Launched in January, Ordinals is effectively a new layer on top of the Bitcoin digital ledger, or blockchain, that allows users to attach data such as a serial number or an image to a satoshi \u2014 the smallest denomination of Bitcoin \u2014 allowing people to create Bitcoin NFTs. Subsequently, someone found a way to use Ordinals to mint tokens that are \u201cfungible,\u201d meaning others can be minted with the same characteristics and publicized on the Bitcoin network. At that point, Bitcoin memecoin mania took off in earnest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Why is that significant?\n\nThe Bitcoin community has traditionally been reluctant to allow such experimentation with its code for fear of overwhelming the network, so the latest development represents something of a leap into the unknown. It\u2019s also a delicate time for the biggest brand in the crypto world, which is bracing for a regulatory crackdown after a market rout in 2022 killed off several big industry names.\n\n5. Who gains and who loses?\n\nThe memecoin frenzy drove transaction fees on Bitcoin blockchain to their highest in almost two years. This brought a windfall to the \u201cminers\u201d who generate new Bitcoin by solving complex mathematical puzzles using banks of powerful computers. If memecoins and similar innovations propel ever more activity on the Bitcoin network, that could inflate the cost of using it and diminish its appeal as a virtual alternative to traditional currencies \u2014 its original purpose.\n\n--With assistance from Olga Kharif.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com"

        "content": "Bitcoin 2023 Miami: Ordinals and Politicians Bring The Heat to Marquee Bitcoin Conference\n\nIt's May in balmy Miami, and that means Bitcoin 2023 is in town (well and those NBA playoffs as well!). The world's largest Bitcoin conference hosted its 2023 edition at the Miami Beach Convention Center for a final time last week. After 3 years in Florida, it\u2019s moving to Nashville in 2024. The conference welcomed the Bitcoin faithful from May 18 to 20, in the latest bid to dispel the Bitcoin winter gloom for good.\n\nThe next presidential hopeful, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., , was among the notable speakers at the event this year. Best-selling author Michael Lewis of The Big Short, Moneyball and The Blind Side was also present. U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry and presidential candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Tulsi Gabbard also attended the event.\n\nBitcoin heavyweights in attendance included Michael Saylor, Adam Back, Samson Mow, Jack Mallers, Caitlin Long, Robert Breedlove, Dan Held, and recent convert David Marcus, who graced the Nakamoto and mining stages to dissect Bitcoin\u2019s biggest pain points and rally the masses.\n\nIndustry Day\n\nThursday's Industry Day was a rather muted affair this year. There was a noticeable decrease in turnout compared to 2022, not only in attendance but also in (mainstream) star power, when the likes of Serena Williams and Jordan Peterson shared their 2 satoshis worth at the Bitcoin event last year.\n\nIt served as an overdue autopsy, with various panelists dissecting last year's FTX meltdown, intense regulatory scrutiny in the US, as well as a renewed emphasis on the importance of self-custodying your Bitcoin holdings.\n\nSeveral engaging talks on the main Nakamoto stage covered all corners of crypto. From why we need Bitcoin in the face of CBDCs and AI, to regulators, Bitcoin NFTs, TradFi, greener mining and so on.\n\nOne notable session, \"Boom to Bust: Wall Street & FTX,\" featured Jan van Eck and Eric Donovan. They explored the relationship between the financial industry and the now-defunct exchange, and the lessons it holds for investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe panel \"Fed vs Financial System '' brought together Caitlin Long, Miles Paschine, Ram Ahluwalia, and Mark Connors. They analyzed the complex dynamics between the Federal Reserve and the financial system.\n\nOther discussions centered around eco-friendly advances in Bitcoin mining, the renewed interest in self-custody, and combating anti-crypto sentiment. Frank Holmes and Andy Long shared insights on mining during the \"Mining Stage\" panel. Matt Odell provided a comprehensive Bitcoin 101 session, emphasizing the importance of self-custody. Additionally, experts like David Zell, Perianne Boring and Mina Khattak discussed strategies for combating regulatory obstacles in the \"Fighting the Anti-Crypto Army\" panel.\n\nGeneral Attendance Day 1\n\nAfter a slow Industry Day on Thursday, Friday saw a sizable uptick in attendance. A solid turnout of visitors came to listen to and interact with hundreds of speakers, Bitcoin proponents, and projects during General Attendance Day 1.\n\nHighlights included pro-Bitcoin regulation talks by Democratic Party hopefuls, Arthur Hayes\u2019 interview with \u201cThe Big Short\u201d author Michael Lewis, the big Ordinals debate, Jack Mallers\u2019 Strike unveiling and more.\n\nSaylor On Ordinals\n\nBitcoin\u2019s biggest evangelist, Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, continues to accumulate Bitcoin over the long term with little regard for short-term fluctuations. He put in a long day in the service of the world's leading cryptocurrency.\n\nThe tech billionaire spent several exhausting hours in the media room at the tail end of the day, where he conducted many in-depth interviews and waxed lyrical about the role of Bitcoin in the face of inflation, authoritarian regimes, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Oh, and network congestion caused by BRC20 and Ordinals transactions.\n\nOn the latter, Saylor remained neutral, stating that he neither endorsed the likes of Ordinals nor wanted it censored.\n\nHe believes that the entire discussion of ordinal inscriptions is important to Bitcoin for two reasons.\n\n1) For Bitcoin to achieve long-term success, the Bitcoin miners must be successful.\n\n2) For companies, governments and individuals to adopt Bitcoin, it is necessary to develop applications on layer two and layer three.\n\nIf one were to discourage application developments, it would make it more difficult to scale and would also harm the Bitcoin mining network, where transaction revenue has to grow faster than the hash rate for the network to grow .\n\nElection 2024 Candidates Champion Bitcoin\u2019s Cause\n\nIn their talks, Kennedy and Gabbard highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s values and importance as a tool against governmental overreach. They explained that it will help to combat enhanced surveillance and financial control, facilitated by CBDCs and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThey criticized US regulators' hostile climate for crypto companies and investors, such as the 30% Bitcoin mining tax. Kennedy in particular laid out a strong manifesto in which he pledged to ensure Bitcoin stays the global hub of crypto. He aims to do this by defending the right to self-custody and run home nodes of Bitcoin, ensuring the neutrality of industry energy regulations, and even reviewing whether the likes of Ross Ulbricht should be pardoned if they\u2019re victims of an anti-crypto crackdown.\n\n\u201cWe broke Bitcoin\u201d: Bitcoin Ordinals Debate Takes Center Stage\n\nThe Big Bitcoin Ordinals Debate brought together experts to discuss the future of Bitcoin. It delved into the implications of ordinals, which have split the Bitcoin community into smaller factions. Those that embrace BRC20 see ordinals\u2019 extended use cases for BTC. But, others see them as an attack on the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency due to the network congestion and fee spikes they bring with them.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Magazine Youtube\n\nBitcoin purists and the new Ordinals and BRC20 rebel alliance clashed on the Nakamoto stage Friday afternoon.\n\nUdi Wertheimer and Eric Walls of Taproot Wizards, sporting cheap wizard outfits and beards, shared the stage with Spiral\u2019s Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin Core contributor, and masked independent writer Shinobi Monkey. Things got off to a predictable start with Shinobi getting called a \u201cBlockchain Karen\u201d by Wertheimer after saying ordinals were an attack on Bitcoin that originated out of the Bitcoin SV camp.\n\nDuring the often lighthearted and technical discussion, the expert panelists explored whether ordinals pose a threat to Bitcoin, and the need to distinguish between user behavior and the underlying protocol. The debate also touched upon different approaches to tokenization, such as counterparty tokens, and covered the efficiency of protocols and trade-offs involved, especially with BRC20.\n\nArthur Hayes Interviews Michael Lewis\n\nDuring a fireside chat, Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, interviewed Michael Lewis, the bestselling author known for books like \"Moneyball\" and \"The Big Short.\"\n\nLewis drew attention in the crypto community after spending time with Sam Bankman-Fried for research on his next book on the FTX collapse.\n\nLewis expressed he\u2019s intrigued by the crypto space and referred to it as \"Financial Kanye.\" He criticized the persistence of financial intermediaries in the banking system, noting that they have found ways to rig the system and take unnecessary rents. Lewis expressed hope for a financial revolution through DeFi. He also speculated on US regulators' slow response to bail out banks connected to crypto during the recent liquidity crisis.\n\nMallers\u2019 Strike Expands to 65 countries and Adds Lightning Features\n\nJack Mallers, CEO of Strike, announced that his Bitcoin payments company Strike has expanded to 65 countries. It would also be moving its global headquarters to El Salvador, as US crypto firms are getting out to friendlier regulatory pastures.\n\nThe expansion allows users to send and receive money instantly using the Lightning Network, catering to the requests of users. The update also introduces the ability to receive funds in U.S. dollar equivalents, including USDT, and a revamp of the app's user interface and logo.\n\nDuring his speech at Bitcoin 2023, Mallers emphasized the company's wider vision, aiming to provide a reliable service for Bitcoin adoption and a unique brand identity. Mallers highlighted the company's responsiveness to user feedback and expressed their commitment to being an exceptional global money app.\n\nSaturday: Day 2 General Attendance\n\nThe final day of Bitcoin Miami 2023 delivered several strong talks revolving around Bitcoin\u2019s current and future use cases. It also covered challenges in an ever-evolving broader technological, investing and regulatory landscape.\n\nNotable talks include The Art of Bitcoin Banking panel with Caitlin Long, Obi Nwosi (Fedi) and Casa\u2019s Jameson Loop, while Adamant Research\u2019s Tuur Demeester pondered if \u201cAI Dream of Electric Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWertheimer was on again in the Transaction Censorship panel with Nick Hansen (Luxor) and Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s Craig Deutsch. The discussion then shifted to global with Zoltan Pozcar (Credit Suisse)\u2019s talk on Geo Politics and Bitcoin. Following that, El Salvador government member Max Keiser explained the plot behind Super-HyperBitcoinization to Stacy Herbert of the Bitcoin Office.\n\nAfter lunch, Lyn Alden and Dylan LeClair spoke on Lightning for Businesses and Steady Lads.\n\nThe 2023 edition finally concluded with a short but good one: The Biggest Bulls. The old and new guard of Bitcoin, Adam Back of Blockstream and Strike\u2019s Jack Mallers espoused on the value of Bitcoin, with the organizer\u2019s Matt Odell moderating.\n\nAsked at what price he would sell his BTC, Mallers made it clear that only health-related expenses would separate him from his satoshis.\n\n\u201c... the only thing that I mentally compartmentalize to reference how to price this thing is how much I value my life.\"\n\nExhibition Hall Highlights\n\nOf course, Bitcoin Miami wouldn\u2019t be the same without some extravagance.\n\nBitcoin Bazaar\n\nThe Bitcoin Bazaar market provided plenty of Bitcoin in-jokes, cool stuff and not-so-subtle digs at the wider crypto space, with everything from Bitcoin panties, shitcoin toilet to Bitcoin children\u2019s books.\n\nAttendees could also ride a mechanical bull to win 1 BTC, play a cornhole competition or kick a soccer ball, or simply gawk at a Bitcoin DeLorean car straight out of Back to the Future.\n\nOrdinals Alley\n\nThe Ordinals Alley by Gamma provided strong visual energy to the event, with dozens of eye-catching art pieces adorning temporary walls and many sold for auction.\n\nThis scene seems likely to continue to explode in the coming year, and with the independent event Ordinals2023 running simultaneously in Miami this year.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBitcoin Week wrapped up in Miami on Bitcoin Pizza Day. It is the industry\u2019s Thanksgiving, with a couple of small events to celebrate Laszlo Hanyecz\u2019s 10,000 BTC sacrifice.\n\nLast year saw a staggering 35,000 visitors flock to the event on the back of the 2021 bull run. The conference, organized by BTC Inc. and Bitcoin Magazine's owners BTC Media, LLC, only drew an estimated 15,000 visitors this year. Factors such as the ongoing crypto winter, Bitcoin market doldrums, and steep ticket prices all drove down attendance.\n\nThe 3-day event remains a necessary staple on the crypto calendar. It serves as a platform for passionate discussions about the impact of Bitcoin. This includes its role in the battle for society in a technological and authoritarian landscape.\n\nOverall, the conference can be a bit heavy handed on the Bitcoin rhetoric if you\u2019re a bit more chain-agnostic. But, it still provides a feast of worthwhile ideas, innovation and discussions for everyone.\n\nWhile Bitcoin Miami 2023 may not herald Crypto Spring yet, it is setting itself up as a springboard to what is to be a much sunnier 2024. With the next Bitcoin halving locked in for late April next year, and the Ordinals and BRC20 movement growing, expect things to be very different this time around next year in Nashville."

The document, which was first published back in April, looks at the use of energy by bitcoin miners in Texas.\n\n\u201cWe show that the flexibility of mining loads can significantly mitigate power shortages and market disruptions that can result from the deployment of mining loads,\u201d the paper said. This could allow policymakers to \u201cfacilitate the participation of large mining facilities in wholesale markets and require them to provide mandatory demand response.\u201d\n\nAccording to a survey from Payless Power, 58% of the 727 Texans surveyed expressed concern about the Texas power grid handling mining.\n\nTexas is home to a number of bitcoin mining companies \u2014 including Marathon and Riot Platforms. In the past, both Governor Greg Abbott and Senator Ted Cruz have expressed their desires to make Texas more bitcoin and crypto friendly.\n\nThe Texas power grid, however, has shown an inability to keep up with surging demand during winter storms and heat waves.\n\nThrough demand response programs, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, gives financial incentives to miners so that they cut power when the grid is facing \u201chigh system demand.\u201d When the miners shut down, the power gets redirected to the grid.\n\n\u201cConsidering the fast integration of new mining facilities, offering proper financial incentives could potentially encourage the new facilities being built in locations with lower carbon footprint and high societal benefit,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nPayless Power found that 48% of those surveyed are concerned about the strain that crypto mining places on the power grid.\n\nAccording to researchers, the model shows \u201cthat while the reliability of electric systems with higher renewable penetration is more susceptible to the integration of mining loads, full flexibility at all times can significantly avoid the reliability concerns created by the mining loads.\u201d\n\nLegislators in Texas introduced Senate Bill 1751, which could remove tax breaks while also requiring miners using more than 10 megawatts to register as flexible load operators with ERCOT \u2013 the state\u2019s largest energy operator.\n\nAs Blockworks previously reported, ancillary services would be the demand response impacted by the bill \u2014 which is when miners sell the right to ERCOT to balance the grid by curtailing the miner load.\n\nBoth mining companies and blockchain advocates have pushed back against the bill, with the head of development at Texas Blockchain Council saying that bitcoin mining \u201cis uniquely capable of addressing the needs of the grid, unlike any other industry.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Blockworks, Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, said that the council will continue to advocate for mining in the state. While Bratcher does not believe that Senate Bill 1751 will pass, he and the council will continue to push back against the bill.\n\nAccording to the paper, different locations present distinct advantages and disadvantages. It says that financial incentives could \u201cpotentially encourage the new facilities being built in locations with lower carbon footprint and high societal benefit.\u201d\n\nWhen looking to build in Texas, some crypto miners have settled in rural towns, causing economic booms in generally overlooked areas \u2014 an argument used by proponents of mining to advocate for friendly legislation.\n\n\u201cBoth location and flexibility are critical factors that policymakers and grid operators should consider when designing ancillary service programs that take advantage of the unique characteristics of the mining loads and enhance their grid-supporting capabilities,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nA number of states are currently weighing legislation both for and against crypto mining. States including Montana, Arkansas, Missouri and Mississippi have either introduced or passed legislation in favor of miners. New York, on the other hand, paused all proof-of-work crypto mining operations last November.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Ron DeSantis vows to 'protect' Bitcoin during presidential campaign launch - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ron DeSantis, the current governor of Florida, has officially thrown his hat in the 2024 United States presidential ring and has notably promised to \u201cprotect\u201d Bitcoin (BTC) if he gets the job.\n\nOn May 24, Twitter boss Elon Musk joined DeSantis and around 520,000 live listeners in the Twitter broadcast of his announcement, which was moderated by venture capitalist David Sacks.\n\n\u201cAs president, we\u2019ll protect the ability to do things like Bitcoin,\u201d said DeSantis. He added \u201cthere\u2019s risks involved with it,\u201d but the people interested in the cryptocurrency \u201care sophisticated\u201d and \u201ccan make decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have every right to do Bitcoin. The only reason these people in Washington don\u2019t like it, is because they don\u2019t control it.\u201d\n\nDeSantis called those on Capitol Hill \u201ccentral planners\u201d who \u201cwant to have control over society.\u201d\n\n\"Bitcoin represents a threat to them, so they\u2019re trying to regulate it out of existence,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Florida governor also hinted at the jurisdictional battle being waged by the Securities and Exchange Commission over cryptocurrencies.\n\nGary Gensler, the current chair of the securities regulator, has long claimed his agency has authority over the crypto space.\n\nRelated: President Biden announces nominations for key positions at Federal Reserve\n\nDeSantis said as Congress had \u201cnever addressed\u201d cryptocurrencies, \u201cthe bureaucracy\u201d \u2014 likely referencing the SEC \u2014 had \u201cto just do it on their own\u201d and made it so \u201cthat people can not operate in that space.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t have an itch to have to control everything that people may be doing in this space, and I think that the current regime \u2014 clearly they have it out for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe added if President Joe Biden is re-elected for another four years in 2024, the regulatory regime for crypto under his administration will \u201cprobably end up killing it.\u201d\n\nEarlier in May, DeSantis passed an anti-central bank digital currency (CBDC) bill in Florida that prohibits the use of a federal CBDC as money, along with banning the use of foreign CBDCs.\n\nThere\u2019s still a way to go before the United States heads to the polls in November 2024. It\u2019s likely DeSantis will face off against former President Donald Trump and others at the first GOP presidential primary debate in the 2024 cycle, slated for August.\n\nOther White House hopefuls have stepped forward to support the cryptocurrency. Democratic presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called Bitcoin a \u201csymbol of democracy and freedom\u201d in a speech at the Bitcoin 2023 conference.\n\nKennedy was also the first presidential candidate in U.S. history to accept campaign donations in Bitcoin, joined days later by Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation \u2014 Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is at 10-week lows, but one longtime analyst is telling investors to ignore the \u201cpanic.\u201d\n\nIn a Twitter update on May 25, Philip Swift, creator of data resource LookIntoBitcoin and co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, eyed a BTC price breakout still in progress.\n\nSwift: \"Bitcoin performing well and as expected\"\n\nBitcoin has not traded this low since mid-March, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows \u2014 and despite residing in a range just $4,000 wide since, cold feet are everywhere.\n\n\u201cA lot of panic in the market today,\u201d Swift summarized.\n\nBTC/USD is currently testing the mettle of key moving averages, as Cointelegraph reported, against a backdrop of traders\u2019 downside targets extending to $25,000 and below.\n\nEven Swift believes that Bitcoin could still return to as low as $20,000 in the coming months, despite remaining bullish on higher timeframes.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day candle chart on Bitstamp.

        "title": "This bearish technical pattern hints at a double-digit drop in Bitcoin price - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A bearish technical formation has driven down the total crypto market capitalization over the past seven weeks. Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2% decline \u2014 and a 1.7% and 2.5% decline from BNB (BNB) and XRP (XRP), respectively \u2014 were the main drivers of the most recent 1.3% correction between May 18 and May 25.\n\nTotal crypto market cap in dollars, 12-hour. Source: TradingView\n\nThe descending wedge formation initiated in April indicates a possible breakout near $1 trillion by late July. For bulls, the bearish structure that drove the total capitalization to $1.11 trillion on May 25 means that an eventual break to the upside would require extra effort.\n\nBitcoin and Ether falter due to weak macroeconomic data\n\nSticky inflation continues to worry investors, who price in higher odds of further interest rate increases by the United States Federal Reserve. The country\u2019s latest personal consumption expenditure indicator displayed a 5% increase, which is noticeably higher than the 2% inflation target.\n\nMoreover, data from Germany\u2019s statistics office on May 25 showed a downward revision to the country\u2019s gross domestic product from 0% to -0.3% for the first quarter of 2023 versus the previous quarter, marking the second consecutive decline. Furthermore, there\u2019s the impending U.S. debt ceiling standoff and the fact that the U.S. Treasury is quickly running out of cash.\n\nThere are also a series of regulatory risks at the forefront due to various governments aiming to tighten their grip on crypto assets. The latest event involved an oversight body within the European Central Bank called the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which recommended special attention to bank run risks on stablecoins. The ESRB mentioned the lack of transparency regarding stablecoins, providing the example of Tether (USDT).\n\nDerivatives hint that bears are unwilling to short\n\nPerpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours.\n\nA positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. Still, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.\n\nPerpetual futures accumulated 7-day funding rate on May 25. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe seven-day funding rate for BTC and Ether (ETH) was neutral, indicating balanced demand from leveraged longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) using perpetual futures contracts.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted futures markets, traders can gauge the market\u2019s sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options.\n\nA 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put option open interest lags the more bullish calls and is, therefore, bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, which can be deemed bearish.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options volume has been below 1.0 for the past couple of weeks, indicating a higher preference for neutral-to-bullish call options. More importantly, even as Bitcoin briefly corrected down to $25,900 on May 25, there was no significant surge in demand for the protective put options.\n\nRelated: Ripe for the squeeze? Bitcoin mining stocks remain under attack from short sellers\n\nMultiple factors will continue to pressure Bitcoin\u2019s price\n\nGiven the balanced demand on futures markets, traders seem hesitant to place additional bets until there\u2019s more clarity on the U.S. debt standoff. It is unclear whether the crypto market will be able to break out of the descending wedge formation.\n\nEven if professional traders are not using derivatives to bet on a catastrophic scenario for Bitcoin\u2019s price, there is presently a lack of triggers for a bull run given the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. So, ultimately, bears are in control as the descending wedge makes its way to another 10% correction until July.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Driven by heightened demand for Bitcoin (BTC) block space, fueled by Ordinals inscriptions and the PEPE-fueled BRC-20 memecoin mania, miners have become direct beneficiaries of a sudden boom in transaction fees, increasing their bottom lines.\n\nThis surge has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the average number of transactions, and consequently revenue per BTC block mined.\n\nData from a recent Glassnode report sheds light on the revenue increase for miners in May, as they raked in a total of 12.9 BTC in mining rewards per block, with fee revenue surpassing subsidies for only the fifth time in Bitcoin\u2019s history.\n\nBitcoin average fee paid per block. Source: Glassnode\n\nCoin Metrics data underscores this phenomenon further, revealing that on May 8, miners generated a staggering $41.16 million in daily revenue, a level unseen since late April 2022, when Bitcoin was trading in the $40,000 zone.\n\nAnd though their daily revenue has tapered off since that peak, adding up the cumulative totals from the past 30 days shows that Bitcoin miners have earned a cumulative total of nearly $1 billion worth of BTC, which is not bad for a bear market!\n\nDaily Revenue of Bitcoin Miners. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nHowever, despite this revenue revival, Bitcoin\u2019s two largest publicly traded miners by market cap, Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), have dipped significantly over the past month.\n\nAs of May 23, RIOT and MARA were 16.16% and 21.33% below their respective April highs.\n\nRIOT and MARA price charts. Source: TradingView\n\nThis price action has raised concerns among investors, which is reflected in the large amount of short positions currently opened on both stocks.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the specifics of market sentiment captured by short interest, and the potential for a technical breakout in Bitcoin mining stocks.\n\nLegacy markets remains skeptical of BTC miners\n\nWhen comparing the year-to-date returns of RIOT and MARA to BTC, it is evident that both have benefited from what\u2019s known as a leveraged beta effect. Leveraged beta, in this instance, suggests that when Bitcoin\u2019s value appreciates, these stocks outperform. Conversely, when Bitcoin slumps, they face deeper downside risk.\n\nYear-to-date returns of RIOT, MARA and BTC. Source: TradingView\n\nThe intriguing aspect here is that despite the impressive returns of RIOT and MARA year-to-date, and their increased revenues over the past month, the short interest percentages on each remain alarmingly high.\n\nThis is proven by dividing the total number of shares sold short by the total float (amount of shares available for public trading).\n\nFor example, if a company had 10 million shares available for public trading (the float), and there were 1 million shares sold short, the short interest % float would be 10%.\n\nSpecifics vary but generally speaking, amounts below 5% are considered low and amounts over 10% are considered high, and thus vulnerable to short squeezes.\n\nAs per Nasdaq data, MARA currently has 25.68% of its float shorted:\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings short interest data. Source: Fintel\n\nWhile RIOT has at 13.48%:\n\nRiot Platforms short interest data. Source: Fintel\n\nThis indicates that Wall Street and the broader legacy financial sector remain unimpressed by the strength Bitcoin and its miners have shown in the first half of 2023 and are expecting some reversion back to the lows in the near future.\n\nGranted there are plenty of valid narratives for this bearish thesis:\n\nRIOT is already up 234% and MARA 174% year-to-date; how much higher from here is realistic?\n\nLooming regulatory hostility such as a White House proposal for a 30% Bitcoin mining tax and the SEC\u2019s probe into MARA.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the U.S. debt ceiling debate and its implications for equity markets.\n\nAnd, the list goes on.\n\nBut while skepticism prevails among speculators, technical analysis offers a contrarian perspective on the potential for further upside from here in miner stocks. Let\u2019s analyze the technical signal that suggests this selling might be overdone and whether it is a good time for offside shorts to consider heading for cover.\n\nShort squeeze stars are aligning\n\nWhat\u2019s most remarkable about the stellar starts both RIOT and MARA have had in 2023, is that despite being up multiples from January, neither appears to be overstretched from a technical standpoint. A sign of just how beaten down their stock prices were in 2022.\n\nThis is underscored by the fact that though they're up 242% (RIOT) and 183% (MARA) year-to-date both are still 80%+ removed from their 2021 all-time highs, and are only just now re-crossing their 200-day moving averages (red line on the chart).\n\nAs shown below, April was the first time MARA traded above all of its moving averages since late December 2021, when it was trading in the high $30 range. More encouraging is the fact that throughout May, it has been back-testing and, so far, holding this breakout.\n\nMARA price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAs the arrow above shows, the last time previous to this that MARA broke above its 200-day moving average after being held below it was July 2020, when its stock price was trading around $1.30.\n\nFollowing that 200-day breakout, it held the trendline throughout the next eighteen months and rode it to an all-time high of over $76 by November 2021.\n\nThat\u2019s not a bad return on investment.\n\nSimilar behavior is also being shown by RIOT, which last broke above its 200-day MA (red line) when it was around $2 in May 2020 before making highs above $71 just eight months later, in February 2021.\n\nRIOT price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nA bullish pre-cursor indeed.\n\nIf Bitcoin is able to regain the momentum it lost in May, regain the $30,000 mark, and begin a leg higher in June, analysts should be on the lookout for BTC mining stocks to continue their out-performance due to the leveraged beta effect and excessive short interest that may be forced to cover which would push prices higher.\n\nAlternatively, if Bitcoin continues its downward trend into the summer then these stocks will almost certainly fall further than the price of BTC on a percentage basis.\n\nIn any event, it will be an interesting niche of the market to keep an eye on as things develop into the monthly close.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe United States is barreling toward a date that could have historic consequences for global markets, running the risk of its first-ever debt default. It's a potential black swan event that could have an outsized impact on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the rest of the crypto market.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned weeks ago that the government would soon run out of funds if the debt ceiling isn\u2019t suspended or raised\u2014possibly as early as June 1. If lawmakers remain deadlocked and can\u2019t come to an agreement on spending, Washington won\u2019t be able to pay its bills, she said.\n\nSimilar standoffs over the debt ceiling have rattled markets in the past, like a prolonged disagreement over the debt ceiling that sent the S&P 500 tumbling 16% in 2011, startling investors before a resolution was reached.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis time around, Wall Street has yawned. The S&P 500 is down less than 1% since Yellen issued her sobering remarks on May 1. However, Bitcoin has fallen more than 7% and Ethereum is down nearly 3% during the same period, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAmerica's \u201cX-date\u201d\n\nTypically, debt ceiling debacles create more noise than market-moving news, Amberdata\u2019s Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt\u2014but he acknowledged that a U.S. debt default is far from off the table.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a pretty intense game of chicken right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd given how crazy things have gone in the past couple of years, I think anything is possible.\u201d\n\nIn the event that the government defaults on its debts, risk assets like stocks and crypto would face short-term pain, Magadini said. He explained that\u2019s because a drop in the quality of government-backed debt would likely raise borrowing costs, counterintuitively increasing its yield and strengthening the dollar compared to other assets.\n\nSimilarly, the dollar could strengthen during a U.S. default as American traders tend to onshore their dollars\u2014swapping foreign currencies and assets for the greenback\u2014during risk-off events, CoinShares\u2019 Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTechnically speaking, the dollar should sell off in the event of a default, but it won't because people tend to onshore their dollars in periods of market stress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dollar might actually strengthen, perversely, because people are getting worried, and that actually won\u2019t be so great for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nButterfill envisions the dollar will strengthen and Bitcoin will slide as the U.S. approaches what the White House has described as America's \u201cX-date,\u201d the official date at which the government can no longer pay its bills.\n\n\u201cThis is a really complicated scenario,\u201d Butterfill said, noting he doesn\u2019t think a default is likely. \u201cIt\u2019s not that obvious what exactly will happen.\u201d\n\nBitcoin May Bounce\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum could react differently in the event of a default, Amberdata\u2019s Magadini said. Bitcoin may bounce alongside gold after an initial slide\u2014as a check on government-issued currency\u2014while Ethereum would likely remain depressed alongside tech stocks, he said.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by Genesis\u2019 Co-Head of Trading Gordon Grant, who told Decrypt that Bitcoin has more upside than Ethereum if the government can no longer meet its debt obligations, but both coins would face pressure initially.\n\n\u201cMaybe there's an initial wick down, as risk assets get absolutely trounced, because the stock market is going to get decimated,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Bitcoin is probably going higher.\u201d\n\nFor Ethereum, Grant said that the second largest crypto by market cap is often tied to indexes tracking tech stocks like the NASDAQ, making it likely to underperform compared to Bitcoin if a default takes place.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't matter whether I think that that's a fair comparison,\u201d he said, noting that that\u2019s how certain models trade the relationship between things like the NASDAQ and Ethereum. \u201cSo, we would tend to expect underperformance of Ethereum.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSVB and Sausage\n\nAs an example of how crypto has performed during recent risk-off events, Grant pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s outsized gains compared to Ethereum in the wake of several bank collapses in March, including Silicon Valley Bank. However, he noted that there\u2019s zero data to suggest how cryptocurrencies could react if the government defaults for the first time in history.\n\nBoth Grant and Magadini highlighted increased activity in the options market for Bitcoin as a potential default draws closer, saying it suggests that traders\u2014mostly institutional ones\u2014are betting the coin will see increased volatility.\n\nAt the end of the day, Grant said he\u2019s confident that lawmakers will exhaust their differences on Capitol Hill and reach an agreement like they always have. But, pointing to the logic of Bloomberg\u2019s Tom Keene, Grant said the bigger question is whether events like these become more common in an ever-more-polarized political climate, and if they\u2019ll ever go away.\n\n\u201cWe can ruminate and pontificate, but the real story is this phenomenon of the US government, as a debtor nation, bumping up against a debt ceiling,\u201d Grant said, adding it\u2019s become \u201chow the sausage gets made in the 21st century.\u201d"

        "content": "On the evening of May 24, Salvatore Leggiero, developer of the forthcoming Bitcoin Tower, officially launched the project at an exclusive architecture-focused event by designer Simone Micheli. The private event was held at the Bella Restaurant Lounge in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\n\nDuring the event, Leggiero and Micheli presented their collaboration for the Bitcoin Tower, which will have a version in the metaverse and a physical building.\n\nSalvatore Leggiero unveiled the initial design draft for the Bitcoin Tower. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nIn an interview, Leggiero told Cointelegraph that the project combined two of his passions. The executive has years of experience in real estate development and acquired a passion for Web3 during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI spoke with many crypto experts, but with all due respect, they don\u2019t understand so much regarding real estate. And, I spoke with many, many important developers also in the city but with all due respect, they don\u2019t understand crypto,\u201d he explained.\n\nSalvatore Leggiero presented the target land plot for the construction. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nThe developer said that because of this experience, he imagined a project that would match his expertise in real estate and his passion for crypto \u2014 and the idea for the Bitcoin Tower in Dubai was born.\n\nLeggiero also told Cointelegraph that he wants the project to be an open project, mentioning the possibility of creating a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for the project. He explained:\n\n\u201cWe will receive many, many inputs from the community because Bitcoin Tower must be an open project, like what Satoshi Nakamoto teaches to us.\u201d\n\nHe added that having a DAO seemed very natural for the project because decentralizing decision-making contributes to making an \u201ceclectic experience for the future.\u201c\n\nDesigner Simone Micheli presented his design for the metaverse version of the Bitcoin Tower. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nThe tower will have a virtual version, which will be launched in the metaverse, and a physical version, which will be built in Dubai. While the location is not yet final, Leggiero hopes to get the approval to build the tower near Sheikh Zayed Road, where the famous Dubai skyline resides.\n\nRelated: UAE infrastructure for crypto is more \u2018business-friendly\u2019 than the US, says exec\n\nLeggiero also told Cointelegraph that having a symbol like the Bitcoin Tower would benefit the region. The developer believes the project could solidify the UAE leadership\u2019s position on cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn addition, the developer highlighted it could provide a hub for the crypto community; for those who live in Dubai and those who are visiting for the many crypto events in the region.\n\n\u201cI have something that I think gives the idea of this evolution of real estate and revolution of the market of hospitality. Bitcoin Tower will be the first of a chain. This is what I dream,\u201d he added.\n\nMagazine: Crypto City: Guide to Dubai"

        "title": "Exploring the Synergy between Bitcoin and ChatGPT: Empowering Financial Conversations - DataScienceCentral.com - Data Science Central",
        "content": "ChatGPT continues to revolutionize the way financial conversations are conducted, by providing its users with a fast and reliable tool for decision-making.\n\nThe synergy between Bitcoin and ChatGPT is evident in how each technology enables the other to reach its full potential. Bitcoin provides an efficient payment system, while ChatGPT enhances conversational capabilities through natural language processing (NLP) technology.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s NLP algorithms can be used to help improve user experience during financial discussions. It understands human behavior patterns as well as underlying market trends, allowing it to generate intelligent insights that can help inform decisions in real-time.\n\nIn addition, ChatGPT can be integrated with existing blockchain systems, such as Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric, which allows for improved security and stability of financial transactions.\n\nThe synergy between Bitcoin and ChatGPT is further strengthened when it comes to customer service. ChatGPT\u2019s AI-powered chatbot can assist customers with their queries in a fraction of the time taken by human labor, allowing for faster resolution times and better customer satisfaction. It can even use sentiment analysis to detect user emotions, meaning that it can respond appropriately in different scenarios.\n\nUltimately, this combination of technologies enables users to conduct financial conversations in a secure and efficient manner, all while being informed by accurate insights and backed up by reliable security systems.\n\nBy exploring the power of these two revolutionary technologies together, businesses and individuals are sure to benefit from improved communication capabilities as well as enhanced customer service. In short, Bitcoin and ChatGPT offer a powerful synergy that is sure to shape the future of financial conversations.\n\nThe potential for this combination of technologies is limitless, and businesses in all industries should take advantage of it. With Bitcoin and ChatGPT powering their financial conversations, they can expect to streamline operations, increase customer satisfaction, and reduce costs. The true power of these two technologies lies in how they empower each other \u2013 so start exploring today.\n\nChatGPT and its ability to break down complex topics and whitepapers\n\nAnother point of synergy between ChatGPT and Bitcoin is the way in which it can easily break down complex topics like fractional trading and bitcoin halving, as well as whitepapers related to blockchain technology.\n\nFor example, if a user wants to learn more about a certain token or protocol, they can ask ChatGPT an open-ended question such as \u201cWhat is the difference between ERC-20 and ERC-721?\u201d ChatGPT will then provide a comprehensive explanation which could include definitions of both tokens, how they work, their advantages and disadvantages, and any other relevant information.\n\nThis helps users gain a better understanding of cryptocurrency investing without having to strain through pages of technical documents.\n\nBy leveraging the power of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning algorithms, ChatGPT further improves its ability to understand financial questions asked by users. This allows it to provide more accurate and in-depth financial advice tailored specifically for individual portfolios.\n\nChatGPT Portfolios and Investment Advice\n\nA lot of people have been putting a considerable amount of faith is ChatGPT as a money manager and, while, perhaps, still not there yet, it is not unimaginable to consider that one day, investors may be able to have a conversation with ChatGPT that helps them construct the ideal investment portfolio.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to gain in value and acceptance, its inclusion as part of an investor\u2019s portfolio could become more commonplace. With the assistance of ChatGPT, it might even become possible for individuals to craft their own personalized portfolios based on their individual risk profiles and long-term goals.\n\nChatGPT can help create customized financial plans tailored to each investor\u2019s needs. Through intelligent conversations, it can guide users through different options and explain why certain investments may be better suited than others depending on an individual\u2019s risk preference and goals.\n\nThis provides increased autonomy over one\u2019s finances while ensuring guidance is at hand when needed.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to mature, it has the potential to become a key part of investment portfolios. With the help of ChatGPT, investors can receive tailored advice on how best to include Bitcoin in their portfolio and how much to allocate towards it.\n\nThis could be particularly useful for those who are new to investing or cryptocurrency and need some direction when figuring out where and how much they should invest in Bitcoin.\n\nBy combining the power of ChatGPT with the growing acceptance of Bitcoin, investors have access to an unprecedented level of customized financial guidance that allows them to make informed decisions about their investments with confidence.\n\nToken risk analysis\n\nRisk analysis refers to the process of evaluating potential investment opportunities. Risk analysis is based on a set of criteria and typically involves an assessment of potential returns, risks, and costs associated with a given investment strategy.\n\nBy analyzing the risk factors associated with Bitcoin investing, ChatGPT can help you understand how to best manage your investments in order to maximize return while minimizing risk.\n\nChatGPT can generate personalized financial advice tailored specifically for your portfolio, but it is important to keep in mind that ChatGPT and its architects acknowledge that AI is not \u201cqualified\u201d to pick assets.\n\nIt can create custom portfolios that reflect unique strategies and optimize for specific preferences such as low-risk or high-returns. Additionally, it\u2019s capable of generating trading code which allows users to automatically execute trades according to predefined parameters.\n\nFor example, someone who is 45 years old and trying to put money away for retirement might ask ChatGPT something like \u201cWhat is the best way for me to invest $10,000?\u201d ChatGPT can then generate a portfolio of investments that is customized to this individual\u2019s risk tolerance and long-term goals.\n\nThis portfolio could include a combination of Bitcoin, stocks, bonds, and other investments.\n\nChatGPT also offers advice on token risk analysis. It considers factors like market volatility when recommending tokens for investment.\n\nWith its comprehensive understanding of the crypto market and vast insights from the blockchain technology it leverages, ChatGPT can offer valuable advice on which tokens you should buy or sell in order to meet your financial objectives.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s limitations\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize that ChatGPT is still in its relative infancy and, therefore, any guidance it is able to provide users should be approached cautiously.\n\nIt cannot guarantee a return on investment, or make any promises about the performance of an asset over time. As with any investment, it is important for users to do their own research before making financial decisions.\n\nUltimately, the potential synergy between Bitcoin and ChatGPT offers investors unprecedented access to customized financial guidance that helps them make informed decisions with confidence.\n\nBy leveraging its powerful chatbot capabilities, ChatGPT can generate personalized portfolios tailored specifically for individual risk tolerances and goals.\n\nAdditionally, its ability to break down complex topics related to blockchain technology gives users deeper insights into cryptocurrency investments, allowing them to maximize returns while minimizing risks.\n\nWith all these features combined, ChatGPT has become an invaluable asset for investors looking to maximize their success.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe synergy between Bitcoin and ChatGPT is undeniable, offering investors the ability to customize their portfolios, take advantage of token risk analysis, and gain a better understanding of complex topics related to blockchain technology.\n\nBy combining these powerful technologies together, ChatGPT can revolutionize the way people interact with the crypto market and build long-term financial success.\n\nWith its comprehensive understanding of cryptocurrency markets and vast insights from the blockchain technology it leverages, ChatGPT can offer invaluable assistance when it comes to making smart investment decisions and optimizing one\u2019s portfolio."

        "title": "Don't treat crypto like gambling \u2014 even if it is largely pointless - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nEven the heat of Miami can\u2019t warm a crypto winter.\n\nThe faithful descended on Florida last weekend for the world\u2019s \u201cbiggest bitcoin event\u201d. Only half as many made the journey as in 2022. Some of the buzz and meme coins were gone. So was the sense of indestructibility, after a year in which some of the crypto world\u2019s biggest names cratered and US agencies launched a slew of enforcement actions in the sector.\n\nThere was a cold blast from Westminster last week too, where an influential parliamentary committee suggested that crypto was, not disruptive or renegade, but worse: borderline irrelevant. Unbacked cryptoassets, said the Treasury select committee, had \u201cno intrinsic value\u201d and served \u201cno useful social purpose\u201d. The right thing to do to protect consumers, it suggested, was to regulate this activity as gambling.\n\nThis was dismissive, appealing and, I think, wrong. The committee has a point about utility. You can be open-minded about the potential for distributed ledger technology, or even stablecoins and central bank digital currency, and still think cryptocurrencies have totally failed to demonstrate their usefulness, either as a store of value, medium of exchange or tool for financial inclusion. \u201cThe industry still does a very bad job of explaining things,\u201d says Oliver Linch, chief executive of Bittrex Global. \u201cIt\u2019s been wink wink . . . if you know, you know, to the moon nonsense.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s concern was that financial regulation would mean a \u201chalo effect\u201d for that kind of guff, giving a false sense of safety \u2014 a legitimate concern. But \u201cto say it\u2019s gambling makes no sense legally\u201d, says Marc Jones, partner at Stewarts Law firm, noting the ownership aspect to cryptoassets. Nor would it be likely to result in effective regulation.\n\nThe dividing line between financial regulation and gambling is already murky. Spread betting and other types of leveraged trading are taxed as gambling but regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Adverts for betting platforms prominently display that 80 per cent of retail accounts lose money, an at-source version of the FCA\u2019s warnings in the absence of more powers.\n\nMeanwhile, UK gambling regulation is still trying to catch up with the invention of the smartphone. It is \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, says Matt Zarb-Cousin, who campaigns to clean up gambling. This year\u2019s gambling reform proposals belatedly pledge controls on free bets and other inducements. The FCA sent shares in spread-betters tumbling in 2016 with leverage limits and bans on account bonuses and promotions. Crypto (and spread betting) can cause gambling-like harm, says Zarb-Cousin. But better to incorporate protections such as self-exclusion tools into the tougher financial framework.\n\nDividing responsibility between regulators would be a mistake. The crypto universe doesn\u2019t neatly split into conceivably useful and definitely pointless. A split is an invitation for regulatory arbitrage. And the intersection of crypto with mainstream finance should be of as much interest to regulators as the tokens themselves.\n\nThe committee\u2019s report seems unlikely to prompt a change of direction from the government, which in February followed Europe and other jurisdictions such as Hong Kong in proposing to regulate crypto under the UK\u2019s existing financial services framework.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make it insignificant. After much excitable talk about the UK as a \u201cglobal crypto hub\u201d, the mood has shifted \u2014 a shift that, oddly, this latest broadside could reinforce. Crypto will increasingly be asked to play by the rules of mainstream finance. The committee is unlikely to be pushing for a lighter touch in the name of innovation.\n\nThis is also true internationally. The US crackdown rests on protecting investors using the same securities laws and standards as for the rest of finance: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to treat the crypto market differently just because different technology is used,\u201d said SEC chair Gary Gensler last year. Iosco, the co-ordinating body for global securities regulators, this week called for watchdogs to move faster in establishing a \u201clevel playing field between cryptoassets and traditional financial markets\u201d, including breaking up crypto firms where services including broking, trading and custody are combined in a way that would be unacceptable elsewhere.\n\nAll signs to date \u2014 from Binance\u2019s troubles in securing licences, to the low success rate for UK anti-money laundering registration \u2014 suggest that large parts of the crypto world, even those eager for the warm glow of accreditation, will struggle to clear basic hurdles, let alone a like-for-like standard. As the crypto winter lifts, it won\u2019t just be conference audiences that have shrunk.\n\nhelen.thomas@ft.com"

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price failed to break above $27,500 for the fourth time in 12 days on May 23. The subsequent 24-hour rejection down to $26,100 might seem small in absolute terms, but it potentially represents the lowest daily close in 68 days.\n\nAs the deadline for the Bitcoin (BTC) monthly options expiry on May 26 approaches, the fate of the $2.26 billion open interest could determine whether the recent bearish trend will prevail, opening room for a correction down to $25,000 or lower.\n\nBitcoin price and the U.S. debt ceiling debate\n\nAnalysts argue that even if the United States government is able to raise the debt ceiling ahead of the June 1 deadline, risk-on assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies could suffer, as the offer of new U.S. Treasurys would drain liquidity from the market.\n\nThe incentives for fixed income are in place as the one-year instruments return a 5.15% yield and the prospects of an economic crisis increase. Regardless of how the U.S. manages its debt issues, in periods of uncertainty, investors tend to seek shelter in the least risky asset classes.\n\nFor instance, U.S. money market fund assets hit a new record of $5.8 trillion this week as investors turned their focus to short-term debt securities, according to Reuters. Fixed-income mutual funds are a primary source of corporate and municipal funding and have faced $615 billion in net inflows so far this year.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 11% accumulated losses since May 6 might be precisely what bears need to succeed in May\u2019s $2.26 billion monthly options expiry.\n\nBitcoin options: Bulls placed 84% of bets above $29,000\n\nThe open interest for the May 26 options expiry is $2.26 billion, but the actual figure will be lower since bulls were expecting a Bitcoin price above $29,000. These traders were caught by surprise as Bitcoin dropped 10.9% between May 6 and May 12.\n\nBitcoin options open interest for May 26. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.38 put-to-call ratio reflects the imbalance between the $1.64 billion call (buy) open interest and the $630 million in put (sell) options.\n\nHowever, if Bitcoin\u2019s price remains near $26,500 at 8:00 am UTC on May 26, only $67 million worth of these call options will be available. This difference happens because the right to buy Bitcoin at $27,000 or $28,000 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\nBears aim for sub-$25,000 to secure a $270 million profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on May 26 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $24,000 and $25,000: 900 calls vs. 12,100 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $270 million.\n\n900 calls vs. 12,100 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $270 million. Between $25,000 and $26,000: 1,800 calls vs. 8,900 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $180 million.\n\n1,800 calls vs. 8,900 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $180 million. Between $26,000 and $27,000: 2,600 calls vs. 6,400 puts. Bears\u2019 advantage is reduced to $100 million.\n\n2,600 calls vs. 6,400 puts. Bears\u2019 advantage is reduced to $100 million. Between $27,000 and $28,000: 4,800 calls vs. 5,200 puts. The net result is balanced between call and put instruments.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor example, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nRelated: Why Bitcoin is stuck below $28,000 resistance\n\nBears could use profits to further pressure Bitcoin\u2019s price\n\nBitcoin bulls will likely be satisfied if they manage to come out empty-handed by pushing the Bitcoin price above $27,000 during the expiry. Meanwhile, bears need a mere 2% price drop from $26,300 to secure a $180 million profit.\n\nGiven the bearish momentum for risk-on assets triggered by the U.S. debt ceiling standoff, Bitcoin bears are in a better position for the May $2.26 billion BTC monthly options expiry.\n\nIn short, an expiry price below $26,000 will boost bears\u2019 appetite to further suppress Bitcoin\u2019s price down to $25,000 or lower.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin fell below US$27,000, recording the second biggest loss among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies on Wednesday afternoon in Asia.

        "content": "\u201cI\u2019m never gonna bother with that bullshit again,\u201d says Bitcoin OG Michael Tozoni about getting a crypto home loan to invest in property.\n\n\n\nAfter becoming wealthy-ish with Bitcoin investments, Tozoni sensibly decided to diversify. Not wanting to sell off his crypto, he had grand plans to borrow to buy investment properties and use the rental income to pay off the loan.\n\n\n\nThe only trouble was that banks aren\u2019t the slightest bit interested in wealthy Bitcoiners, preferring poor wage slaves instead.\n\nMichael Tozoni took out a Bitcoin-backed loan hoping to diversify into property. (Supplied)\n\n\u201cIf you are broke and you have no money, but you have a job and a constant income, banks will be very happy to give you money,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you have a lot of money and a lot of investments, but no income, banks do not want to give you money.\u201d\n\nWhile Tozoni eventually found some traditional lenders willing to provide him cash, he crunched the numbers and realized that the interest on a Bitcoin-backed loan was cheaper, at least in his particular circumstances. Looking back, this was probably a mistake.\n\nTozoni is the poster boy for the typical Bitcoin-backed loan customer, according to Adam Reeds, CEO of Toronto-based crypto lending firm Ledn.\n\n\u201cBitcoin-wealthy clients that have been turned down from services at legacy financial institutions\u201d is how Reeds describes the cohort.\n\nThe idea of putting Bitcoin up as collateral for properties intrigued Tozoni, as he\u2019d be able to purchase investment properties and keep his Bitcoin.\n\nThe only trouble is: It\u2019s risky as shit.\n\nHow crypto home loans work\n\nHere\u2019s the lowdown: Instead of selling your Bitcoin for cold hard cash to buy your dream home or investment property outright, you can stash it away as collateral with a lender.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty much an agreement with the lender that says if things go south, worst case, they keep your Bitcoin.\n\nIf and when you pay your loan off, you get your Bitcoin back.\n\n\n\nSo far, so good, but the loans come with a massive catch \u2014 if the value of your Bitcoin collateral goes down too far, it gets liquidated.\n\nThat means Bitcoin\u2019s wild and unpredictable price swings make this a high-risk, some-reward-style scenario compared to traditional mortgages.\n\nWhile mortgages backed by banks only require a 10%\u201320% cash down payment, most crypto collateral loans start at 100% of the loan value, and some require 200%.\n\nMeaning, at the minimum, you are going one-to-one with the loan, so if you have your sights set on a $600,000 loan, be prepared to lock up at least $600,000 of your precious Bitcoin.\n\nIf the price of Bitcoin decides to take a nosedive, while you\u2019re conveniently out of phone reception, you might miss the margin call urging you to top up your collateral. Or you might not have enough extra funds to cover it.\n\nIf that nosedive turns into a full-blown swan dive, then bam, your Bitcoin collateral disappears as quickly as a magic trick, otherwise known as liquidation.\n\nSo, how did it work out for Tozoni?\n\n\n\nHe says, \u201cIt started out kind of okay,\u201d as the first properties \u201cmade a grand here and there, but then it just went downhill\u201d as the COVID-19 pandemic kicked off.\n\nHe selected a 200% collateral ratio, meaning his lender held the power to instantly liquidate the collateral if its value dropped below \u201c115%\u2013120%.\u201d\n\n\n\nTozoni says it required constant monitoring of Bitcoin\u2019s price, from breakfast to dinner.\n\n\u201cIf it gets down to 170%, you get a margin call where you have to deposit more money. If it gets down to 115% or 120%, it\u2019s instant liquidation. So, they just dump it right away in order to be able to cover their amounts.\u201d\n\nRisks of crypto home loans\n\nReeds explains that this is the biggest concern that Ledn\u2019s new clients have before signing up for a Bitcoin-backed loan: What happens in the event that Bitcoin\u2019s price drops, and how much time will they have to come up with the additional collateral?\n\n\u201cIf the price of Bitcoin drops by more than 50% from the time they took the loan, the client must top up the Bitcoin collateral to maintain the loan in a healthy status,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile Ledn\u2019s Bitcoin mortgage product allows two weeks to post additional collateral, the \u201cstandard Bitcoin-backed loans are programmatic, and margin calls need to be met before reaching the liquidation threshold,\u201d Reeds explains.\n\nAdam Reeds, CEO of Ledn. (Laura Proctor)\n\nUnfortunately for memecoin hodlers, the only digital asset that Ledn accepts as collateral is Bitcoin, with the collateral ratio \u201cset at 100% of the value of the property being mortgaged.\u201d Its home loans are currently only available in Ontario, Canada, but it plans to expand to other provinces and some U.S. states later this year. Mortgages are also only for two years before being assessed and renewed.\n\nJarrad Parke, chief operating officer of Australian firm Black Tie Digital, says that collateralization is the No. 1 topic new customers want to try to understand. \u201cWhat surety they have that their digital assets will be returned to them,\u201d Parke says. The firm acts as a broker for those looking to get a crypto-backed loan.\n\nIn Tozoni\u2019s case, he opted for a \u201ctwo-to-one collateral\u201d strategy, aka 200% collateral, meaning he had to deposit twice the amount of Bitcoin he wanted in the equivalent value of traditional fiat cash.\n\nJarrad Parke from Black Tie Digital. (LinkedIn)\n\n\u201cIf I wanted to borrow $100,000 [in cash], I had to put down $200,000 in Bitcoin,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nParke says that people who have Bitcoin should understand that \u201cif you\u2019re holding digital assets, you\u2019re holding assets \u2013 full stop.\u201d\n\nHe emphasizes that one of the biggest barriers to entry for most people is the ability to save the deposit. It is pointed out that \u201ccrypto has allowed an ever-increasing number of people\u201d to short-cut through this process.\n\nLike any investment lending decision, it all comes down to risk.\n\nParke says the collateralization rate \u201cis primarily driven by the size of the loan and the length of the term.\u201d\n\nAlthough its lending partners are the ones who decide what digital assets are able to be collateralized, Parke explains that \u201cgenerally, low market cap tokens, highly volatile tokens and the like aren\u2019t accepted.\u201d\n\n\u201cBTC and ETH represent almost 2/3 of the total market cap. We generally find most significant holders of digital assets are covered.\u201d\n\nAdvantages of a crypto home loan\n\nSome people have had good experiences with Bitcoin-backed home loans. Max (not his real name) tells Magazine he\u2019s happy with his crypto mortgage organized through Ledn for a \u201cvery unique property\u201d as an investment.\n\nMax took the Ledn option as legacy banks are \u201creally bad at taking digital assets as collateral.\u201d The crypto mortgage means he\u2019s been able to hang onto his Bitcoin in expectation of future price gains. He also avoided a nasty capital gains tax bill that would have resulted from selling off Bitcoin to buy a property outright with the profits.\n\n\u201cI want to take advantage of fiat debasement. I don\u2019t want to realize capital gains, and I believe Bitcoin will continue to average 50% YOY.\u201d\n\nMax warns anyone considering this loan option to conduct their own due diligence and \u201ccalculate risk correctly,\u201d as price drops can lead to a dreaded margin call. He says he is yet to experience one.\n\nMax sees a bright future for crypto-backed loans, believing that Bitcoin hodlers will especially find value in the product.\n\n\u201cBitcoiners are very capitalized and will start to want to take advantage of it without selling,\u201d he says.\n\n30-year crypto mortgages with Milo\n\nThere\u2019s no official history of crypto-backed mortgages to rely on, but it seems as if Nexo was the first platform to offer large crypto-backed loans back in April 2018, providing enough funds to buy a house.\n\nSince then, a small number of specific crypto collateral home loan providers have appeared, including fintech companies Milo and Figure in 2022 \u2014 though Figure seems to have been telling prospective customers to join the waitlist for over a year now.\n\nMilo\u2019s announced its world\u2019s first 30-year crypto mortgage product in January 2022.\n\n\u201cClients will be able to finance 100% of their purchase with no dollar down payments required and do this faster than a conventional mortgage,\u201d it said at the time.\n\n\n\nMortgages are available to purchase property worth up to $5 million at a 9.95% rate, collateralized with ETH, BTC and USDC. The product is only available for properties in the United States.\n\nWithin three months, Milo announced that it had closed a \u201crecord $10 million in crypto mortgages.\u201d\n\nMilo CEO Josip Rupena spruiks the crypto-backed 30-year mortgages on CNBC. (CNBC)\n\nIn comments to Cointelegraph in 2022, Milo said that its customer base was mainly Bitcoin and Ether hodlers who wanted to get a loan, while they kept on hodling.\n\nIt said the market turmoil had made potential clients more wary.\n\n\u201cWe have definitely seen that consumers are requiring more transparency from the companies that they engage with. This has given us an opportunity to see how we improve our solution even more in this period of time. We are still seeing demand from consumers that want our unique solution.\u201d\n\n\n\nJosip Rupena, CEO of Milo, updates Magazine via email for this story, saying the total value of crypto-backed loans written has now risen to \u201caround $17 million,\u201d and the firm has yet to liquidate a client\u2019s cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cWe have not issued any margin calls, and all of the clients that have worked with Milo have made $ on the appreciation of their Bitcoin or Ethereum.\u201d\n\nWhich raises an interesting point. While a crypto price plunge could see users wiped out, a crypto price rise could see the loan progressively more and more overcollateralized.\n\nWill the big banks offer crypto mortgages?\n\nCrypto winter has taken a lot of the heat out of the products this year. Investment bank Citi released a report in June 2022 saying that crypto mortgages were gaining prominence, despite it being \u201crare to find new types\u201d of mortgages in the post-GFC U.S. finance market.\n\nCrypto-backed mortgages have been around since 2018. (Pexels)\n\nThe report notes that crypto mortgages offer tax and liquidity benefits for both customers and borrowers.\n\n\u201cThe core idea of protecting from capital gains tax and a more liquid reserve account for credit exposure can potentially be mutually beneficial to both originators and borrowers if the financial assets in question were stable and liquid.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllowing crypto investors to utilize their investment gains to secure a loan without incurring the tax event and loss of further upside if they were to liquidate said cryptocurrency into cash,\u201d it says.\n\nHowever, due to the highly volatile nature of crypto, it notes that this loan might not be a viable option for everyone.\n\n\u201cThis issue may be compounded if the payment rises in the event of a downturn in cryptocurrency prices,\u201d it states.\n\nGuy Dickinson, former treasurer of HSBC Australia and now the CEO of blockchain carbon trading platform BetaCarbon, is skeptical of the idea that major financial institutions will adopt crypto collateral loans any time soon.\n\n\u201cThere will be a handful of pilots at best until there is an established multi-year risk model,\u201d he says.\n\nEven though Dickinson has transitioned into the Web3 world himself and left behind the traditional finance industry, he reckons TradFi institutions won\u2019t take on crypto-collateral loans until protection is available to cover itself.\n\n\u201cBased on my experience as the treasurer of HSBC and the recent experience of how loan providers are proceeding with extreme caution with traditional lending criteria, it is highly unlikely that crypto as collateral would be a scalable, commercially viable option until someone is willing to \u2018insure\u2019 the collateral.\u201d\n\nYou can buy your dream home with a crypto-backed loan\u2026 but it might turn into a nightmare. (Pexels)\n\nDickinson says the \u201ccrypto asset class is poorly understood\u201d and holds vast complexities for lenders to navigate.\n\nHe points out that the \u201crecent debacles with FTX\u201d encourages bankers to stay away from crypto and \u201cstay in their wheelhouse.\u201d\n\nHowever, he notes that the concept of using different securities or commodities as collateral is not new.\n\n\u201cIf we replaced the word crypto with shares or precious metals, we would be able to move forward under the well-established Lombard lending frameworks commonly used in private banking circles,\u201d he explains.\n\nWhy a crypto home loan went south for Tozoni\n\nMichael Tozoni\u2019s plans to diversify out of crypto into property went south. (Supplied)\n\nTozoni says that trying to keep afloat with a Bitcoin-backed loan was incredibly stressful.\n\n\u201cBitcoin continued to decline, and I would keep getting margin calls. So, it\u2019s just many stressful months of having to add more and more Bitcoin and not to lose my other Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nFew assets you could put up for collateral have the potential to plummet in price quite as quickly as Bitcoin, which Tozoni discovered during the COVID-19 pandemic price plunge when the world\u2019s markets started to panic about a potential depression.\n\nMarch 12, 2020 \u2013 aka \u201cCrypto Black Thursday\u201d \u2013 saw the price of Bitcoin drop from $8,000 to $3,600, in a matter of minutes.\n\n\u201cThere was a short flash crash [March 12, 2020] where Bitcoin crashed,\u201d he says, explaining that it was a \u201cvery short-term crash, where it dove down, and then two or three days later came back up.\u201d\n\nTry and avoid Bitcoin price action like this if you have a crypto-backed home loan.\n\nBut there was no grace period built into the loan, so everybody\u2019s collateral who went below the margin was liquidated, including Tozoni.\n\nTozoni is understandably grumpy with the lender, as he believes if they had exercised some patience and \u201cwaited three days\u201d until it came back up, he would still be the proud owner of his Bitcoin.\n\nAdding insult to injury, Parke warns that borrowers can run into more problems than just losing their crypto assets if a margin call is made. They can also face tax consequences if their Bitcoin was worth more than they bought it for.\n\nCrypto-backed loans are inherently risky due to volatility. (Pexels)\n\nHe says that while some \u201clenders offer non-recourse products,\u201d liquidation will likely still trigger a capital gains event while \u201ccosting the borrower any future gains.\u201d\n\nTalk about a rough day in the trenches, getting slapped with a big tax bill after losing your Bitcoin collateral.\n\nAfter Tozoni\u2019s Bitcoin disappeared quickly, he was \u201cstuck with just real estate.\u201d\n\nThis might not seem so bad since he at least had something, but it proved to be an extended nightmare for him when his tenants became tight-fisted during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cA lot of tenants did not pay during COVID-19,\u201d he says, explaining that he was trying to liquidate the properties because he was moving but found it impossible to sell a property where \u201cthere are tenants unwilling to pay.\u201d\n\nThe values of the properties were diminishing because of it, according to Tozoni.\n\nSome tenants \u201cjust disappeared and messed up the property,\u201d so he had additional costs to get things fixed while still hurting from all the lost Bitcoin.\n\nCrypto home loans: The higher the collateral, the better\n\nIn hindsight, Tozoni believes he probably should have opted for a higher collateral ratio, to protect himself against a sudden flash crash.\n\n\u201cThree to one, even a four to one [collateral ratio] if you want to be safe,\u201d Tozoni says, as he believes \u201cthe worst case scenario\u201d happened to him where his Bitcoin was liquidated at the lowest price before the price shot up again.\n\n\u201cSo, even if I were to sell my properties, it [Bitcoin] was already higher than that,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, looking back at the whole ordeal, Tozoni has reached a level of peace with the whole situation but still regrets how it played out.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018Finally, this nightmare is over.\u2019 I ended up giving more and more and more and then most of it ended up gone. But then on the other hand, it\u2019s been like a year and a half of just stress, of constantly being drained.\u201d"

        "content": "On May 23\u2019s episode of The Market Report, analyst and writer Marcel Pechman discusses why Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck near $27,000 and how the macroeconomic scenario has become more critical than ever for an eventual breakout. Plus, the show dissects what United States President Joe Biden has been saying about crypto traders being wealthy tax cheaters.\n\nThe first news article shows that the most significant price movements tend to occur after periods of low volatility, as traders tend to get overconfident and add leverage. That creates a perfect storm for a decisive breakout, so, ultimately, stop-loss orders and liquidations further boost the price swing.\n\nPechman does not believe the U.S. Federal Reserve decision on June 14 will be the trigger everyone expects because it\u2019s relatively priced in that the current 5% rate will be maintained. In his 20-year trading experience, Pechman says those events tend to come out of nowhere.\n\nThe show dissects what Biden has been saying about wealthy crypto traders cheating on their taxes. The alleged protections for crypto traders refer to tax-loss harvesting \u2014 a strategy investors use to reduce their overall tax liabilities.\n\nAccording to Pechman, tax-loss harvesting is nothing new and is relatively common in the stock, mutual fund, and commodities markets. There are no grounds for Biden\u2019s baseless differentiation of asset classes, and Pechman does not believe the U.S. president is in a bargaining position right now, with less than 10 days to go before a potential debt default.\n\nThe show\u2019s third and final article covers the speculation of an imminent Bitcoin breakout toward $29,000. The recent sideways price movement is eerily similar to early April when Bitcoin\u2019s 12-hour chart ranged between $27,800 and $28,700 for 11 days.\n\nHowever, Pechman reveals little similarity between the early April bullish breakout and the current status of the Bitcoin futures premium and options risk metric. The bottom line? This time is different, which doesn\u2019t mean bulls can\u2019t get ahead; it\u2019s just less likely according to those metrics.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out! The show is available exclusively on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel."

        "content": "MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--US Data Mining Group Inc. dba US Bitcoin Corp (\u201cUSBTC\u201d), which announced an all-stock merger of equals with Hut 8 Mining Corp. (NASDAQ: HUT) on February 7, 2023, today announced that it has been selected after multiple rounds of bidding in a competitive auction process to manage the restructured mining division of Celsius Network LLC (\u201cCelsius\u201d), which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022. USBTC submitted the winning bid as part of the Fahrenheit, LLC (\u201cFahrenheit\u201d) coalition.\n\nThe Fahrenheit coalition includes crypto industry pioneers USBTC, Arrington Capital, Proof Group Capital Management, Steven Kokinos, and Ravi Kaza. Upon restructuring, Fahrenheit will serve as the management company of the broader Celsius entity. Fahrenheit will receive a management fee of $20 million per year as part of a five-year agreement with Celsius.\n\n\u201cOur specialized expertise and track record of execution ultimately secured Fahrenheit\u2019s successful bid to restructure Celsius,\u201d said Michael Ho, CEO of USBTC. \u201cEach member of the coalition brings extensive experience operating, optimizing, and scaling high-potential assets across web3 markets.\u201d\n\nUnder the proposed restructuring, USBTC will enter into one or more operating and services agreements with the restructured company to become the exclusive operator of all mining assets formerly owned by Celsius. In addition to a portion of the management fee, USBTC will also receive from Fahrenheit a fee of $15 million per year net of operating expenses to manage the mining division of the restructured company. USBTC expects to increase its total installed hashrate under management by approximately 12.2 EH/s upon full energization of the Celsius fleet of 121,800 machines.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply committed to building value for the creditors of Celsius,\u201d said Asher Genoot, President of USBTC. \u201cJust as we did with Generate Capital and NextEra Energy in the Compute North bankruptcy, we will help another deserving partner emerge from bankruptcy stronger than ever. We\u2019re incredibly excited to get to work and show the world what we can achieve together.\u201d The consummation of Celsius\u2019 restructuring transaction is subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court.\n\nAbout US Bitcoin Corp (USBTC)\n\nUSBTC is a leading industrial-scale operator of bitcoin mining sites, specializing in the design, construction, and management of sites with access to low-cost and sustainable sources of energy. The company operates four sites across the United States with total capacity of more than 730 MW of electricity and generates revenue through self-mining, hosting, managed infrastructure operations, and equipment sales.\n\nUSBTC announced an all-stock merger of equals with Hut 8 Mining Corp. on February 7, 2023, which is subject to customary closing conditions.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nElon Musk\u2019s heart-to-heart with Republican presidential nominee and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis culminated with a focus on digital assets\u2014touching on Bitcoin and the digital dollar, with a Dogecoin reference thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe conversation between Musk and DeSantis, which was moderated by entrepreneur David Sacks, didn\u2019t achieve liftoff until more than thirty minutes after its scheduled start time, with hundreds of thousands of Twitter users finding their apps crashing and the audio stream glitching. But the chat eventually got underway, and toward the talk\u2019s tail end, DeSantis leaned into his position as an advocate of crypto\u2019s largest coin.\n\nThe Florida governor portrayed his support of Bitcoin as a matter of civil liberties, and attempts to restrict crypto by his opponents as government overreach.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou have every right to do Bitcoin,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cThe only reason these people in Washington don\u2019t like it is because they don\u2019t control it.\u201d\n\nAs the 2024 election season gets underway, DeSantis\u2019 remarks mirror those of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who heralded Bitcoin last week as an example of democracy and anathema to authoritarians.\n\nOn Wednesday, DeSantis touched on the uptick in regulatory enforcement actions that the digital assets industry has confronted so far this year, accusing the government of trying to purge digital assets to preserve the reign of those in power.\n\n\u201cBitcoin represents a threat to them,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to regulate it out of existence.\u201d\n\nDeSantis pledged that if Congress ever tried to institute a ban on \u201cthings like Bitcoin\u201d by passing new legislation, that he would vehemently oppose it. He also said that the current administration could snuff out Bitcoin if Biden is reelected.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe current regime, clearly, they have it out for Bitcoin,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cAnd if it continues for another four years, they\u2019ll probably end up killing it.\u201d\n\nAddressing the political conversation\u2019s shift toward a focus on crypto, David Sacks noted there\u2019s a big crypto audience on Twitter. Musk interjected to say there\u2019s one for \u201cDogecoin too.\u201d\n\nDeSantis has incorporated remarks against central bank digital currency into his platform over time, echoing statements made by representatives like Tom Emmer and pursuing a ban against government-backed cryptocurrencies in Florida.\n\nCentral bank digital currencies (CBDC) are similar to assets like stablecoins that are pegged to the price of a sovereign currency like the greenback. But instead of being issued by private companies on public networks, they are managed by their respective governments or central banks.\n\nIn the case of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Jerome Powell has said a CBDC would \u201cideally\u201d receive written approval from Congress. But DeSantis said there\u2019s no wiggle room in terms of that, and it won\u2019t happen on his watch.\n\n\u201cYou must get authorization from Congress,\u201d DeSantis said of a CBDC. \u201cI can tell you, if I\u2019m president, we are not doing a central bank digital currency.\u201d\n\nDeSantis underscored his message that a CBDC could be used to curtail purchases deemed politically unfavorable in the eyes of those who control the tech, possibly pushing environmental issues or preventing firearm sales.\n\n\u201cI see it as a massive transfer of power from individual consumers to a central authority, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good for a free society,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a \u2018no\u2019 on [a] central bank digital currency.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD"

ETH fell to $1,786, marking a 1.3% loss on the week, according to Coingecko.\n\nAmid the top 50 cryptocurrencies, the market saw a lot of movement over the past seven days, with a few notable winners and some big losers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe biggest gainer of the week is Render (RNDR), which has seen an impressive 19.3% growth on the week.

The Render Network is a decentralized platform that enables users to contribute their unused GPU power to render motion graphics and VFX.\n\nRNDR has been trending on Twitter this week thanks to its recent partnership with Apple and its integration with Solana. The big green candle could also be fueled by Render\u2019s work on the new Pudgy Penguins toy line video. Last week, Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz celebrated the project's toy line launch on Amazon, saying \"I want Pudgy Penguins to be the face of NFTs.\"\n\nThe Sandbox game (SAND), a popular immersive Gamefi platform, commanded second place over the past 24 hours, gaining 5.4% and currently changing hands at $0.51.

Ethereum scaling solution Optimism (OP) also had a rough week, seeing a 12.6% red candle and swapping hands at $1.60.

The lawmakers approved the new bill during a plenary session on May 25, the local news agency News1 reported.\n\nAccording to the report, the bill involved amendments to the National Assembly Act and the Public Service Ethics Act. The amendment to the National Assembly Act was unanimously passed with the support of 269 votes from 269 lawmakers present. The amendment to the Public Service Ethics Act received 268 votes from 268 lawmakers present.\n\nPassed on May 22, the amendment to the National Assembly Act officially places cryptocurrency in the list of registered property by lawmakers. The amendment to the Public Service Ethics Act also obligates high-ranking public officials as well as members of the National Assembly to disclose cryptocurrency assets.\n\nThe latest legal developments in South Korea come in response to a major government scandal involving some National Assembly members moving large amounts of cryptocurrency.\n\nRelated: South Korea to vote on bill requiring crypto asset disclosure for lawmakers\n\nKim Nam-kuk, formerly a member of the main opposition Democratic Party in South Korea, in early May was found to have once held at least $4.5 million in Wemix tokens.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nPrague, Czech Republic, May 24, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Over 80 exhibiting companies, 130 speakers from all over the world, including one of the most famous figures of the Bitcoin world, Michael J. Saylor, three days of lectures, workshops, and 10 thousand visitors. At the beginning of June, Prague will host the first edition of BTC Prague, the largest and most important event in Europe focused solely on the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nMichael J. Saylor is among the most influential Bitcoin maximalists and key figures in the crypto world. American Michael J. Saylor founded the company MicroStrategy, which regularly buys Bitcoins as part of its corporate assets and with 132,000 Bitcoins, the richest cryptocurrency company in the world, and will now speak in Europe for the first time. This will happen during the BTC Prague conference, the Bitcoin event of the year, which will take place from June 8th to 10th at the PVA Let\u0148any exhibition center in Prague.\n\n\"Michael has an excellent reputation and strong and consistent views that carry significant weight in the Bitcoin community, and he is also a person who opened the doors to Bitcoin adoption by traditional companies. That is why I am glad that we managed to persuade him to speak for the first time in Europe at our event,\" says Martin Kucha\u0159, one of the organizers of BTC Prague. \"With an estimated attendance of 10,000, a conference that is unrivaled, not just in the Czech Republic, but also across Europe.\"\n\nIn addition to Saylor, a number of other influential personalities in the Bitcoin world, including Blockstream CEO Dr. Adam Back, SatoshiLabs co-founder Marek Palatinus, and Robert Breedlove, author of the popular \"What is Money?\" podcast, have accepted invitations to Europe\u2019s largest exclusively Bitcoin-focused conference. The bi-lingual Czech-English program promises to offer a wealth of stimulating ideas for entrepreneurs, researchers, influencers, philosophers, developers, and advocates of freedom g throughout the course of the three-day event.\n\nStory continues\n\nRunning parallel to the program on stage, the expo will also take place, showcasing over 100 companies focused on building Bitcoin infrastructure. These include providers of hardware and software wallets, mining tools, exchanges, or even beer taps connected to the Lightning Network. Among the exhibitors, there will be one exclusive guest - El Salvador. The Central American country, which made history two years ago as the first in the world to make Bitcoin the official national currency, is sending a government delegation to Prague to share their experience and review the implications of their groundbreaking decision at the crypto event of the year.\n\nThe BTC Prague organizers aim to appeal not only to seasoned Bitcoin enthusiasts but also to those who have some knowledge of Bitcoin yet are not fully immersed in it. Their ambition is to guide these individuals through the entire Bitcoin journey.\n\n\"In the current complex economic situation, when we all feel the effects of inflation, uncertainties surrounding the stability of banks or high-interest rates, Bitcoin is proving to be a kind of lifeboat. It is certainly riskier today not to have it than to have it. Therefore, we want to focus heavily on newcomers, to make it easier for them to enter the Bitcoin world and practically show them how to do it,\" says Martin Kucha\u0159.\n\nMartin, a significant figure in the domestic Bitcoin scene, along with his brother Matyas, has been instrumental in organizing four successful annual Bitcoin events known as ChainCamp. These events attract over 2,000 enthusiasts each year in Ostrava. Moving to Prague and significantly expanding the scale of the entire event is a logical culmination of both brothers' journey or rather the growing popularity of Bitcoin.\n\nThe fact that the largest and most significant Bitcoin conference will take place in Prague is symbolic, as Martin Kuchar says, the Czech Republic is the \"Bitcoin Valley\" of the crypto world and Prague could boldly be called the world capital of Bitcoin because of a number of revolutionary projects that played a key role in the adoption of the world's largest cryptocurrency was created in the Czech Republic. We can name, for example, the hardware wallet Trezor from SatoshiLabs or the first mining pool from Braiins, or Bitcoin ATMs from General Bytes. \"I see BTC Prague as another Czech project that confirms the importance of the Czech Republic for Bitcoin,\" adds Martin Kuchar.\n\nCONTACT: Alnura Belyalova Director of PR, Luna PR alnura@lunapr.io\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s possible there were more.\n\nThe team or person behind BPizza, the new memecoin with the second-largest investment total, quickly changed its sell tax, to 100%, meaning it would be unfeasible for investors to sell it. Meanwhile, EthPizza turned off transfers and sales for the token shortly after accumulating a market cap of $38,000.\n\nThe coin with the highest market cap, BTCPizza, was still trading as of Wednesday afternoon at a market cap of nearly $200,000.

They have no practical use and quite often are scams for unsuspecting investors seeking the next big thing.\n\nOne of the latest, and perhaps most surprising memecoin moons, came from Pepe coin, which quickly peaked at market cap of $1.6 billion before plummeting. The coin still had a market cap of more than $250 million on Wednesday, according to CoinMarketCap."

        "content": "Following on the heels of Bitcoin's rise as first-generation blockchain technology, enterprises are beginning to move their blockchain projects into production.\n\nDeloitte's 2021 Global Blockchain Survey, polling a sample of 1,280 senior executives and practitioners in 10 locations, found that nearly 80% of overall respondents said digital assets -- and their underlying blockchain technologies -- will be \"very/somewhat important\" to their respective industries in the next 24 months.\n\nHowever, different use cases require different types of blockchain.\n\nThere are four main types of blockchain networks: public blockchains, private blockchains, consortium blockchains and hybrid blockchains. Each one of these platforms has its benefits, drawbacks and ideal uses.\n\n1. Public blockchain How it works. The first type of blockchain technology is public blockchain. This is where cryptocurrency like Bitcoin originated and helped to popularize distributed ledger technology (DLT). It removes the problems that come with centralization, including less security and transparency. DLT doesn't store information in any one place, instead distributing it across a peer-to-peer network. Its decentralized nature requires some method for verifying the authenticity of data. That method is a consensus algorithm whereby participants in the blockchain reach agreement on the current state of the ledger. Proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS) are two common consensus methods. This article is part of Blockchain for businesses: The ultimate enterprise guide Which also includes:\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business\n\nTop 10 benefits of blockchain for business What are the 4 different types of blockchain technology?\n\nWhat are the 4 different types of blockchain technology? 7 must-have blockchain developer skills Download 1 Download this entire guide for FREE now! Public blockchain is non-restrictive and permissionless, and anyone with internet access can sign on to a blockchain platform to become an authorized node. This user can access current and past records and conduct mining activities, the complex computations used to verify transactions and add them to the ledger. No valid record or transaction can be changed on the network, and anyone can verify the transactions, find bugs or propose changes because the source code is usually open source. The four main types of blockchain vary by how open or closed they are, which affects their speed, privacy and security. Advantages. One of the advantages of public blockchains is that they are completely independent of organizations, so if the organization that started it ceases to exist the public blockchain will still be able to run, as long as there are computers still connected to it. \"Some blockchains incentivize users to commit computer power to securing the network by providing a reward,\" noted James Godefroy, a senior manager at Rouse, an intellectual property services provider. Another advantage of public blockchains is the network's transparency. As long as the users follow security protocols and methods fastidiously, public blockchains are mostly secure. James Godefroy James Godefroy Disadvantages. The network can be slow, and companies can't restrict access or use. If hackers gain 51% or more of the computing power of a public blockchain network, they can unilaterally alter it, Godefroy said. Public blockchains also don't scale well. The network slows down as more nodes join the network. Use cases. The most common use case for public blockchains is mining and exchanging cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. However, it can also be used for creating a fixed record with an auditable chain of custody, such as electronic notarization of affidavits and public records of property ownership. This type of blockchain is ideal for organizations that are built on transparency and trust, such as social support groups or non-governmental organizations. Because of the public nature of the network, private businesses will likely want to steer clear.\n\n2. Private blockchain How it works. A blockchain network that works in a restrictive environment like a closed network, or that is under the control of a single entity, is a private blockchain. While it operates like a public blockchain network in the sense that it uses peer-to-peer connections and decentralization, this type of blockchain is on a much smaller scale. Instead of just anyone being able to join and provide computing power, private blockchains typically are operated on a small network inside a company or organization. They're also known as permissioned blockchains or enterprise blockchains. Advantages. The controlling organization sets permission levels, security, authorizations and accessibility. For example, an organization setting up a private blockchain network can determine which nodes can view, add or change data. It can also prevent third parties from accessing certain information. \"You can think of private blockchains as being the intranet, while the public blockchains are more like the internet,\" Godefroy said. Because they're limited in size, private blockchains can be very fast and can process transactions much more quickly than public blockchains. Disadvantages. The disadvantages of private blockchains include the controversial claim that they aren't true blockchains, since the core philosophy of blockchain is decentralization. It's also more difficult to fully achieve trust in the information, since centralized nodes determine what is valid. The small number of nodes can also mean less security. If a few nodes go rogue, the consensus method can be compromised. Additionally, the source code from private blockchains is often proprietary and closed. Users can't independently audit or confirm it, which can lead to less security. There is no anonymity on a private blockchain, either. Use cases. The speed of private blockchains makes them ideal for cases where the blockchain needs to be cryptographically secure but the controlling entity doesn't want the information to be accessed by the public. \"For example, companies may choose to take advantage of blockchain technology while not giving up their competitive advantage to third parties. They can use private blockchains for trade secret management, for auditing,\" Godefroy said. Other use cases for private blockchain include supply chain management, asset ownership and internal voting.\n\n3. Hybrid blockchain How it works. Sometimes, organizations will want the best of both worlds, and they'll use hybrid blockchain, a type of blockchain technology that combines elements of both private and public blockchain. It lets organizations set up a private, permission-based system alongside a public permissionless system, allowing them to control who can access specific data stored in the blockchain, and what data will be opened up publicly. Typically, transactions and records in a hybrid blockchain are not made public but can be verified when needed, such as by allowing access through a smart contract. Confidential information is kept inside the network but is still verifiable. Even though a private entity may own the hybrid blockchain, it cannot alter transactions. When a user joins a hybrid blockchain, they have full access to the network. The user's identity is protected from other users, unless they engage in a transaction. Then, their identity is revealed to the other party. Advantages. One of the big advantages of hybrid blockchain is that, because it works within a closed ecosystem, outside hackers can't mount a 51% attack on the network. It also protects privacy but allows for communication with third parties. Transactions are cheap and fast, and it offers better scalability than a public blockchain network. Disadvantages. This type of blockchain isn't completely transparent because information can be shielded. Upgrading can also be a challenge, and there is no incentive for users to participate or contribute to the network. Use cases. Hybrid blockchain has several strong use cases, including real estate. Companies can use a hybrid blockchain to run systems privately but show certain information, such as listings, to the public. Retail can also streamline its processes with hybrid blockchain, and highly regulated markets like financial services can also see benefits from using it. Medical records can be stored in a hybrid blockchain, according to Godefroy. The record can't be viewed by random third parties, but users can access their information through a smart contract. Governments could also use it to store citizen data privately but share the information securely between institutions."

        "content": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has received optimism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) one year since it adopted Bitcoin (BTC). The IMF\u2019s positive outlook reflects the country\u2019s economic prospects and the impact of embracing the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nThe IMF published a report expressing a more positive view of the country\u2019s economic prospects for 2023. The report indicates a projected rebound in real gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 2.2%, attributed to factors such as the base effect and policy adjustments leading to enhanced fuel supply. The IMF also anticipates an average inflation rate of 6.3% for 2023.\n\nAccording to the IMF document, the projected public debt of the CAR is expected to remain sustainable. However, the report highlights the presence of significant liquidity risks, as indicated by relevant debt indicators. These risks arise from potential shortfalls in donor support and challenges in accessing domestic and regional markets.\n\nThe CAR made history by becoming the second country in the world, after El Salvador, to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender. Despite being one of the poorest nations in the world, the CAR is harnessing the potential of Bitcoin to reshape its financial infrastructure and boost its economic prospects.\n\nFollowing the approval of Bitcoin as legal tender in CAR, the government wasted no time in laying the groundwork for digital currency integration. CAR President, Faustin-Archange Touadera, revealed the initiative called Sango Project, marking the country\u2019s entry into the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nRelated: IMF sees room for eNaira improvement in first-year assessment\n\nIn December 2022, the CAR announced a delay in the listing of Sango Coin on crypto exchanges. The decision was attributed to prevailing market conditions and marketing considerations. On March 31, the organization behind Sango Coin announced further delays \u201cjust for a few weeks,\u201d citing legal and regulatory obstacles.\n\nIn January 2023, the Sango Project revealed that a government task force is actively working on legal amendments to enable the smooth integration of the cryptocurrency.\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum: Can we fix it?"

        "content": "Renton, United States --News Direct-- Chainwire\n\nStably, a leading Stablecoin-as-a-Service (SCaaS) and fiat on/off-ramp infrastructure provider for Web3 projects, is aiming to revolutionize the nascent Bitcoin ordinals market by launching its US Dollar (USD)-backed stablecoin, Stably USD, as a natively-issued BRC20 token under the symbol #USD. This groundbreaking development marks a critical milestone in the exponentially growing Bitcoin ordinals ecosystem that is now reaching half a billion dollars in total market capitalization in less than six months.\n\n#USD is a BRC20 standard stablecoin created via the Bitcoin ordinals protocol which was introduced in January 2023 after the recent Taproot upgrade. BRC20 tokens use a technique called ordinal inscriptions to attach data to individual satoshis, the smallest unit of a bitcoin. These satoshis can then represent anything from digital art ownership to \u201cmeme coins\u201d and even stablecoins.\n\nAccording to Stably, every #USD token is backed 1-to-1 with USD held by a US-regulated custodian in a collateral account for the benefit of KYC/AML-verified token holders. Monthly reports for the account are also conducted by a third-party stablecoin attestor to ensure #USD tokens are always fully collateralized with USD.\n\n\"When I met Domo, the creator of the BRC20 standard, at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, I told him about our upcoming plans for #USD,\" said Kory Hoang, Stably\u2019s CEO and Co-Founder. \u201cHe thought it was great and funny how we are creating a stablecoin on Bitcoin to enable Bitcoin trading on-chain\u2026 With a stablecoin built on Bitcoin. I\u2019m still chuckling about it to this day, actually. In just one week after that, however, we made it happen!\u201d\n\nThe integration of BRC20 #USD into the Bitcoin network is part of Stably\u2019s mission to power the next billion Web3 users with a seamless fiat-to-crypto and stablecoin onramp to all popular and emerging blockchain networks. The company\u2019s upcoming collaborations with prominent ordinals and BRC20 projects, including UniSat\u2013the world\u2019s largest decentralized wallet/marketplace for ordinals\u2013and Ordzaar\u2013Asia\u2019s first decentralized ordinals marketplace project, reflect Stably's aspiration to drive global innovation and adoption toward decentralized finance on the Bitcoin network, or \u201cBitFi.\u201d Additionally, Stably\u2019s engineers are now exploring the new ORC20 standard for Bitcoin ordinals, which could significantly enhance the token properties of #USD once implemented.\n\nStory continues\n\n#USD can be issued/redeemed with Fedwire, SWIFT, USDC, and USDT by KYC-verified users across 200+ countries/regions currently, including up to 44 US states. Stably states that it is employing a manual process of issuance/redemption for #USD\u2019s initial launch but plans to release support for automatic issuance/redemption through its Stably Ramp widget during Q3 2023. By then, users of #USD will be able to on/off-ramp via more traditional payment methods like ACH, instant ACH, and credit/debit cards, in addition to bank wires.\n\nFounded in 2018, the 20+ team member Seattle FinTech is backed by leading institutional and angel investors in the crypto space, such as Morgan Creek Capital, BEENEXT, 500 Startups, Hard Yaka, CREAM Labs, Sunny Lu of VeChain, and Paul Stahura of Donuts, Inc. The company has raised over $7.5-million in total funding to-date, $5-million of which was collected during its last Pre-Series A round in December 2021. Stably has also expanded its fiat on/off-ramp and stablecoin natively to more than 10 emerging networks, including Arbitrum, XRP Ledger, Stellar, Tezos, VeChainThor, Harmony, Polymesh, Coreum, ICON, and Chia Network.\n\nAbout Stably\n\nStably is a Web3 payment infrastructure provider and FinCEN-registered MSB from Seattle. The company specializes in providing stablecoins and fiat <> crypto on and off-ramps to users of Web3 applications. Stably\u2019s mission is to power this decade\u2019s next billion Web3 users with regulatory-compliant payment infrastructure across both developed and emerging blockchain ecosystems.\n\nVisit stably.io to learn more.\n\nRisk Disclaimer: Digital assets involve significant risks, including (but not limited to) market volatility, cybercrime, regulatory changes, and technological challenges.

The company stated that all accounts will be closed, and users are urged to withdraw their funds either as Bitcoin or fiat currency (GBP/EUR) from the Bottlepay app before the closure date.\n\nFailure to withdraw funds by the closure date will result in Bitcoin being converted to fiat currency and returned to the nominated bank account, while any fiat left in the account will be returned to the nominated bank account as well.\n\nIn a statement, Bottlepay advised users to utilize the app's downloads feature to save transaction statements before the closure date. The company emphasized that Bitcoin transactions can have tax implications, making the downloaded information valuable for future reference. As the closure date approaches, Bottlepay may contact users who still have Bitcoin or fiat currency in their accounts, either through the app or via email. However, the company cautioned users to be aware of potential scams and never initiate an offboarding process outside of the app.\n\nRegarding the next steps, users are advised to download their transaction history and close their Bottlepay accounts. Instructions on how to withdraw funds from Bitcoin and fiat accounts, as well as how to download transaction history and close accounts, can be found on the app.\n\nIn a closing note, Bottlepay expressed gratitude to its customers and apologized for the inconvenience caused by the closure. While the company refrained from making specific recommendations about what to do with Bitcoin funds, users were encouraged to exercise due diligence when selecting alternative custodial wallets or converting Bitcoin to fiat currency.

        "title": "How the Lightning Network could solve Bitcoin's speed and scale conundrums - OKX",
        "content": "The emergence of ordinals and BRC-20 tokens sparked a lively debate within the Bitcoin community. On the one hand, enthusiasts celebrated the newfound potential these innovations bring to the Bitcoin blockchain. On the other hand, concerns have been raised about the rise in gas fees, longer transaction times, and the potential occupation of valuable block space by ordinals and BRC-20 tokens.\n\nMost BRC-20 tokens use ordinal inscriptions of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data to create, deploy, and transfer tokens. However, this method is criticized by developers for being far more expensive in transaction fees compared to using binary.\n\nBitcoin has encountered concerns like this before, particularly regarding scalability. For example, in the past, transactions on the Bitcoin network could take a few minutes to several hours to finalize, not to mention the high gas fees encountered.\n\nThe good news is, Lightning Labs recently released its rebranded version of Taro, now called the Taproot Asset Protocol, which aims to help alleviate network congestion, lower gas fees, and bridge BRC-20 to another advancement that's helping solve some of Bitcoin's challenges: the Lightning Network.\n\nIn 2018, the Lightning Network, a layer 2 payment protocol layered on top of Bitcoin, launched to make transactions faster, cheaper, and more efficient.\n\nOKX is one of the major exchanges to embrace the Lightning Network, integrating it seamlessly into our platform. This forward-thinking move enables our users to enjoy lightning-fast deposits and withdrawals, making transactions smoother and more efficient.\n\nWill, from our Product Marketing team, has put together a video tutorial on how you can deposit and withdraw Bitcoin using the Lightning Network with OKX. Let's find out more about it.\n\nWhat is the Lightning Network?\n\nThe Lightning Network is an innovative payment protocol designed to supercharge your transactions. When you make a transaction with the Bitcoin blockchain, it needs to be recorded by the entire network, which takes time. The Lightning Network allows users to create private payment channels directly between themselves, bypassing the need for every transaction to be broadcast on the entire network and therefore saving time.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to send some Bitcoin to a friend. Both of you hop on the Lightning Network and open a private channel. Once the channel is open, both of you can conduct an unlimited number of transactions with each other without needing to record each transaction on the blockchain.\n\nThese off-chain transactions are only known between yourself and your friend involved in the channel, providing privacy and reducing the load on the main blockchain. The Lightning Network uses smart contracts to establish trust between yourself and those you invite to your private channel to make sure of proper funds settlement.\n\nIt allows for instant payments and increased scalability since transactions can be processed within the payment channel without needing confirmation from the entire Bitcoin network. This dramatically reduces transaction fees and improves the overall speed and efficiency of the Bitcoin network.\n\nDepending on network congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain, you may be paying more in gas fees than what you're trying to send to your friend. The Lightning Network is also a tangible solution for Bitcoin micropayments.\n\nThe Lightning Network, as previously mentioned, operates as a layer 2 solution that seamlessly integrates with the existing Bitcoin infrastructure. Instead of modifying the fundamental Bitcoin protocol, it establishes an extra layer that works in parallel with it.\n\nIt's important to flag that Lightning Network and Lightning Labs are distinct entities. While both are related to Lightning technology, they serve different purposes. The Lightning Network refers to the decentralized payment protocol itself. Meanwhile, Lightning Labs is responsible for maintaining the Lightning Network and developing the network\u2019s technology. The Lightning Network developers created LDN, an implementation of the Lightning Network protocol. It serves as a software framework that allows developers and users to interact with the Lightning Network. And, they're the developers behind the Taproot Assets Protocol.\n\nLightning Labs is also behind the @Lightning Twitter account, not the Lightning Network protocol.\n\nLightning Labs Taproot Assets Protocol\n\nLightning Labs recently announced the Taproot Assets Protocol, which aims to provide a more efficient method for users to create new assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. In addition, by operating \"maximally off-chain,\" the protocol seeks to avoid network congestion, a persistent issue on the Bitcoin network since the introduction of the BRC-20 token standard by anonymous developer \"Domo\" on March 8, 2023.\n\nWith the Taproot Assets Protocol, users can seamlessly integrate BRC-20 assets into the Lightning Network. This means that wallets, exchanges, and merchants can simply be ported over instead of starting a new ecosystem from scratch, streamlining the process for everyone involved. This development holds great promise for enhancing the usability and scalability of the Bitcoin network.\n\nWhere has the Lightning Network been integrated?\n\nThe Lightning Network continues to grow in both functionality and adoption, with various major players in crypto and beyond now integrating the technology. OKX and Binance both offer users the option to process BTC payments via the Lightning Network, providing unprecedented speed when completing transactions.\n\nCoinbase is also reportedly looking to add the Lightning Network to its platform for BTC payments. Meanwhile, Kraken, Bitfinex, River Financial, and CoinCorner have also integrated the network with their respective platforms. Meanwhile, July 2023 saw Lightning Labs announce a new suite of developer tools that integrate Bitcoin with artificial intelligence and Large Language Models such as ChatGPT. Now, these technologies can hold, receive, and send Bitcoin via the Lightning Network, as well as on-chain.\n\nAlso in 2023, Google Cloud partnered with Lightning-as-a-Service provider Voltage to increase its hosting capacity and expand Voltage\u2019s global reach. The partnership allows Voltage users to create Bitcoin Lightning nodes anywhere in the world through Google Cloud, providing cheaper and ultra-fast payment processing compared to alternative options. As the core of Voltage's client base place payment processing at the center of their business, the Google Cloud collaboration could help boost network activity and guide more players towards the Lightning Network.\n\nThese developments and partnerships underline the versatility and wider potential for the Lightning Network beyond its core applications, signaling that further growth for the network could lie ahead.\n\nThe benefits of the Lightning Network\n\nThe Lightning Network has gained significant attention, especially around the hype of BRC-20 and ordinals, by providing users with speedy transactions and low gas fees. The benefits go well beyond this.\n\nSpeed: Lightning Network transactions are confirmed within seconds, significantly faster than Bitcoin blockchain transactions.\n\nCost: Lightning Network transactions are generally more cost-effective than Bitcoin blockchain transactions.\n\nPrivacy: Lightning Network transactions offer enhanced privacy compared to Bitcoin blockchain transactions.\n\nThe Limitations of the Lightning Network\n\nWhile the Lightning Network has a dedicated team of developers and enthusiasts behind it, it imposes some limitations you should know of. And, it's important to do your own research before participating in a protocol.\n\nLiquidity: One core challenge of the Lightning Network is receiving liquidity. Currently, users can't receive funds over the network until they\u2019ve received funding liquidity from another user\u2019s node.\n\nChannel capacity: The Lightning Network's payment channels have a maximum fund capacity, limiting the size of transactions within each channel.\n\nNetwork routing: As the Lightning Network expands, finding efficient routes between participants for transactions becomes increasingly complex, potentially resulting in slower or failed transactions.\n\nSecurity: The Lightning Network has some security concerns, such as the risk of fund theft if hackers compromise a user's node.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe Lightning Network is indeed a promising technology that holds the potential to enhance the usefulness and accessibility of Bitcoin. While it's constantly being developed, it addresses the need for faster and more cost-effective transactions.\n\nHowever, like any evolving technology, the network has limitations requiring attention and resolution before widespread adoption can be seen. Nevertheless, as further advancements and refinements are made, the Lightning Network will continue to bring us closer to a more efficient and scalable blockchain ecosystem.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nTHIS ARTICLE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

        "title": "Energy Web Launches Certification for Sustainable Bitcoin Mining - GlobeNewswire",
        "content": "ZUG, Switzerland, May 24, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Energy Web, an independent non-profit that develops open-source software for clean energy solutions, today announced the launch of Green Proofs for Bitcoin (GP4BTC), a first-of-its kind initiative to establish an independent, standardized energy measurement system for the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\n\n\nGP4BTC will provide transparency into the decarbonization efforts of Bitcoin miners and hosting companies, supporting the industry on its journey to net-zero. As part of the solution, certifications will be issued to Bitcoin miners based on their clean energy use and contributions to grid stability via demand response. By delivering verifiable metrics that are consistent across companies and geographies, GP4BTC will provide recognition and reputational benefit for companies mining sustainably, as well as improved access to institutional finance and other returns on their investments into sustainability practices.\n\nSpeaking on the launch of the certification initiative, Amy Westervelt, Senior Delivery Lead and head of the GP4BTC initiative at Energy Web, said \u201cToday Bitcoin is scrutinized for its electricity consumption and associated climate impact. While leading miners are pursuing strategies to reduce their carbon footprints, the industry lacks a unifying definition of sustainable mining, as well as a shared framework for assessing and verifying miners\u2019 sustainability practices. Green Proofs for Bitcoin seeks to provide this.\u201d\n\nLaunched with five certified miners, the GP4BTC certification platform and registry assesses miners via a Clean Energy Score and a Grid Impact Score, each of which are calculated based on operational information including location and energy consumption data. Together, these scores reflect miners\u2019 procurement of renewable electricity, siting operations in regions with low grid carbon intensity, and their contributions to grid stability through demand flexibility.\n\nDeveloped in partnership with over 35 miners, NGOs, grid operators, and other energy and crypto market participants, this approach to scoring is aligned with best practices for sustainability leadership in other industries, and to approaches to corporate ESG reporting in the financial sector and beyond.\n\n\u201cUntil now, efforts to standardize clean energy procurement practices and drive collective action across the Bitcoin mining sector have been siloed and inconsistent,\u201d added Westervelt. \u201cWhile other electricity-intensive industries have benefited from custom decarbonization roadmaps, Bitcoin has largely been ignored, creating a negative feedback loop where climate-conscious miners are left to forge their own paths. Our goal is to create a virtuous cycle where clean mining is easier to define, pursue, and monetize\u2014so that it eventually becomes the status quo.\u201d\n\nFor miners, GP4BTC offers a solution for miners to provide evidence of clean energy practices. Using Energy Web\u2019s privacy-first Green Proofs technology, miners retain full ownership and control of their data. For Bitcoin users and institutions, GP4BTC provides a one-stop-shop for discovering and validating miners' sustainability credentials so they can make data-driven decisions regarding commercial strategy and policy.\n\nAt launch, certified miners and data centers include Argo Blockchain, Cowa, DMG Blockchain Solutions, Hive Blockchain Technologies, and Gryphon Digital Mining.\n\nDMG\u2019s CEO, Sheldon Bennett, commented, \u201cWe are pleased to be included among the initial Green Proofs for Bitcoin miner participants. We believe Energy Web\u2019s launch of Green Proofs for Bitcoin represents a real first step towards recognizing a broad swath of industry participants for powering their data center equipment utilizing primarily carbon neutral energy sources.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis initiative will settle the basis for long term sustainability within the Bitcoin mining industry. We are proud to contribute to the growth of the ecosystem and to have the ability to certify our commitment towards sustainability,\u201d said Fiorenzo Manganiello, co-founder of Cowa.\n\n\u201cDecarbonization represents one of the main priorities for the sector, and by providing standardized and verifiable metrics, as well as acknowledging best practices with certifications, initiatives such as Energy Web\u2019s Green Proofs for Bitcoin serve a fundamental role in driving industry standards. At Argo, sustainable mining has been at the core of our business model and growth strategy ever since our foundation. We are proud of our GP4BTC certification, and we look forward to contributing to the impact and success of this exciting initiative,\u201d said Seif El-Bakly, Interim CEO at Argo Blockchain.\n\nPresident and CEO of Hive Blockchain Technologies Aydin Kilic commented, \u201cIn our commitment to be green energy focused\u2014which has been our mandate since HIVE went public back in 2017 as the first publicly traded crypto miner\u2014we are glad to see the industry embracing this strategy, and advocates like Energy Web helping to validate and certify the renewable aspects of crypto miners. This makes our industry stronger. We hope that the public, along with policy makers and utility companies, realize that a large contingent of crypto miners are utilizing renewable energy.\u201d\n\nGryphon Digital Mining\u2019s CEO Rob Chang urges the Bitcoin mining industry to start providing concrete evidence of sustainable mining practices. \u201cWe need to move past pandering press releases and start offering tangible, coordinated, third-party certifications that confirm clean energy use,\u201d Chang emphasized. \u201cWe believe in GP4BTC\u2019s mission and proudly announce that Gryphon is one of the first recipients of its certification. As Bitcoin mining continues to grow, it is critical to prioritize sustainable practices and hold the industry accountable for its impact on the environment.\u201d\n\nEnergy Web is keen to work with any Bitcoin miner or other party interested in using Green Proofs for Bitcoin. Miners and data centers can learn more about the solution and apply for certification directly at www.GP4BTC.org or by contacting gp4btc@energyweb.org.\n\n\n\nAbout Energy Web\n\nEnergy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

        "title": "How whale activity fuels Bitcoin cycles: a 2017 vs. 2023 comparison - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin price rally in 2017 was largely driven by the ICO craze kicked off by Ethereum and a focus on altcoins.\n\nWhile the 2023 YTD price increase is driven by institutions and large wallet investors, the 2017 cycle was largely supported by retail traders.\n\nProfit rotation from altcoins drove a Bitcoin price rally in 2017, while DeFi-related assets take the center stage in 2023.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price cycles are structured around halving events that occur once roughly every four years, when rewards to miners are cut in half. The next BTC halving is expected in early 2024, and evaluating the differences between the 2015 to 2017 and 2020 to 2023 Bitcoin cycles can help traders define their expectations and prepare for the bull run.\n\nAlso read: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: BTC to surprise investors with 10% sell-off\n\nComparing two Bitcoin price cycles and whale activity\n\nBitcoin\u2019s massive price rally in its 2015 to 2017 cycle set a record. However, the 2020 to 2023 cycle, which sent BTC to an all-time high of $69,044, has different catalysts and players. Still, the two Bitcoin price cycles followed a similar trajectory: it started with a bullish catalyst that was followed by capital rotation into BTC and massive participation from key players in the ecosystem.\n\nThe two cycles, however, differed in terms of the role played by retail and institutional traders, as well as activity of large wallet investors, popularly known as whales, in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nThe 2015 to 2017 Bitcoin price cycle is considered one of the most iconic ones and can be summarized as follows:\n\nInitial Coin Offering (ICO) spree initiated by Ethereum.\n\nAltcoins, shitcoins and everything in between.\n\nCapital rotation into Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin price rally to $19,665 in mid-December 2017 was fueled by a massive participation of retail investors.\n\nBitcoin whales pushed BTC price to its 2017 cycle top\n\nBased on data from crypto intelligence tracker Santiment, there was a consistent rise in the number of large wallet addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC. At the beginning of 2015, there were 13,903 addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 Bitcoin, 1,438 addresses containing between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC and 90 wallets holding between 10,000 to 100,000 Bitcoin.\n\nAll three segments of large wallet investors on Bitcoin witnessed a consistent increase from 2015 to the 2017 cycle top, after which there was a notable decline. Bitcoin price is represented by the green line.\n\nBitcoin whale wallet address count through segments in the 2015 to 2017 cycle\n\nAs seen in the chart above, a large segment of retail traders accumulated BTC at a discount, before price started rallying in the second half of 2017.\n\nThe 2015 to 2017 Bitcoin cycle in a glimpse\n\nIn 2017, Bitcoin acted as a gateway for market participants to jump in on the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) craze, where traders exchanged BTC for altcoins and the popularly known shitcoins, currencies with little to no discernible purpose and low value. This fueled a massive spike in demand for Bitcoin and acted as a catalyst for its price rally.\n\nThe following chart from TradingView puts Bitcoin\u2019s dominance into perspective and signals a massive decline after the 2017 bull run, at a moment when altcoins gained relevance and popularity. In the 2015 to 2017 cycle, capital rotated from altcoins to Bitcoin, giving the flagship cryptocurrency an edge over the others, but this changed at the cycle\u2019s end.\n\nMarket Capitalization Bitcoin dominance %\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance fell from nearly 100% at the beginning of 2015 to just over 96% in 2017.\n\nHow the 2020 to 2023 Bitcoin cycle is different\n\nThe 2020 to 2023 BTC price cycle kicked off in a similar fashion as previous cycles. In this case, the bullish catalyst was Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, instead of the ICO craze. . DeFi emerged as the biggest highlight of 2020, going from $700 million locked in contracts at the beginning of 2020 to as much as $15 billion by the end of that year.\n\nCompound was one of the largest DeFi players as it allowed traders to deposit crypto into lending pools that facilitated borrowing. Lenders, in turn, earned an interest on the assets they deposited, fueling the DeFi spree that lasted all summer, with several copy cats and similar protocols offering the service to market participants.\n\nA wave of food-themed DeFi tokens flooded the market, with SushiSwap (SUSHI), BurgerSwap (BURGER), Yam Finance (YAM), BakerySwap (BAKE), Pizza (PIZZA), Hotdog.Swap (HOTDOG), and Kimchi Finance (KIMCHI) taking the lead. Capital rotated from these assets to Bitcoin and BTC\u2019s rally in the first half of the cycle was also driven largely by retail traders.\n\nLater, MicroStrategy\u2019s incursion into Bitcoin started the era of mass institutional participation in crypto. Investment banks, funds and hedge funds turned to Bitcoin as an opportunity to amass returns for their clients. Tesla\u2019s $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase in 2021 contributed to the shift of traditional markets\u2019 attention into the crypto ecosystem, leading to a rally in Bitcoin price that was fueled by a frenzy among large wallet investors and institutions.\n\nWhale transactions worth $1 million or higher, represented in blue, climbed steadily throughout 2020, hitting a peak in early 2021 and Q3 2021. This signals an increase in participation by large wallet investors on the Bitcoin network in the 2020-2023 cycle.\n\nWhale transaction count (valued at $100,000 or higher), represented by yellow bars, peaked in the months leading up to BTC\u2019s run up to its peak of $69,044.71 in November 2021. The chart below focuses on the role of whales in Bitcoin price cycles and the critical role played in the 2021 bull run.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin whale participation and activity\n\nWhales emerged as one of the dominant catalysts in Bitcoin\u2019s price cycles. When BTC price hit its all-time high of $69,044.71, both segments of whale transactions climbed to their peaks, highlighting the importance of these participants in Bitcoin\u2019s cycles.\n\nRising whale transaction count can therefore be considered a sign of an impending BTC price rally, based on data from the 2015 to 2017 and the 2020 to 2023 cycles. While Bitcoin price cycles do not repeat, and the catalysts which start them can change, there seems to be a common factor pushing the BTC price higher every time: whales."

        "title": "Take a look at Wolf\u2019s first cohort of Bitcoin-driven startups - TechCrunch",
        "content": "Historically, startups have built their products on blockchains outside of the Bitcoin network to avoid its slow transaction speeds, high fees and inability to communicate cross-chain.\n\nBut thanks to efforts like the Lightning Network and Taproot Assets (formerly Taro), which have improved the Bitcoin network\u2019s accessibility, speed and scalability, a number of enthusiasts are building on top of Bitcoin.\n\nFor reference, the Lightning Network is a layer-2 payment system that aims to enable faster transactions at a nominal cost for the blockchain. Separately, Taproot, which launched in April 2022, aims to help issue digital assets on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain that can then be transferred to Lightning Network instantly in low-fee transactions.\n\nIn Wolf\u2019s Clothing (Wolf), a startup accelerator launched by asset management firm Stone Ridge, is a similar effort that wants to bolster Bitcoin-focused applications and use cases. Over 100 teams from 36 different countries applied to be a part of the flagship, exclusively nonremote cohort, based in New York City.\n\nIts first cohort, Wolfpack 1, consisted of eight teams and 23 founders from 10 countries, and they presented their ideas on Wednesday during a demo day, exclusively covered by TechCrunch+.\n\nAll teams were provided seed capital by Wolf, the accelerator\u2019s CEO, Kelly Brewster, said. NYDIG, a subsidiary of Stone Ridge, is also supporting the program, alongside mentorship and investments from Bitcoin-centric VC firms and operating companies.\n\nMany of the startups presented real-world use cases that weren\u2019t about improving the bitcoin ecosystem but rather were products and services people can use everyday, only powered by faster payment rails. The majority of the startups integrated the Lightning Network into their tech.\n\nThe program featured 30 guest speakers from Stone Ridge and NYDIG, among others, including Lightning Labs co-founder and CEO Elizabeth Stark; Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation; and Lyn Alden, who founded Lyn Alden Investment Strategy.\n\nCompany: 10101\n\nWhat it does: Decentralized trading on Bitcoin\n\nFounders: Philipp Hoenisch, Richard Holzeis, Lucas Soriano del Pino, Mariusz Klochowicz, Daniel Karzel\n\nThe pitch: 10101 (Ten Ten One) provides decentralized finance and bitcoin trading through its mobile application. The company is a self-custodial, on- and off-chain wallet that lets users trade perpetual futures without counterparty risks or third-party middlemen, like exchanges.\n\nThe application is fully open source and powered by the Bitcoin Dev Kit and the Lightning Dev Kit. The company plans to add synthetic stablecoins and other products like binary options, futures, structured products and prediction markets to its application in the long term, co-founder Philipp Hoenisch said during his pitch.\n\nIt is raising a $2.7 million seed round and plans to launch publicly in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nCompany: Arcade\n\nWhat it does: Global peer-to-peer marketplace built on Nostr\n\nFounders: Christopher David, Erik Aronesty\n\nThe pitch: Arcade is building a decentralized global marketplace for peer-to-peer commerce with an initial focus on expanding in the Nigerian market. It wants to build a global order book that allows people to buy any product or service globally. Peer-to-peer Bitcoin onramps have to be uncensorable, global, mobile and extensible, \u201cso that\u2019s what we\u2019re building,\u201d said co-founder and CEO Christopher David.\n\nThe marketplace hopes to claim the market share freed up by the recent closure of P2P marketplaces like LocalBitcoins. It builds on censorship-resistant open networks for payments like Bitcoin, Lightning and the data network Nostr. The application is live in beta mode with about 500 test users.\n\nArcade is currently raising $2 million in seed funding via YC SAFE.\n\nCompany: Agora\n\nWhat it does: Social debate platform\n\nFounders: James Pierog, Ruban Sundara Raj T\n\nThe Pitch: Agora is a gamified social debate platform where people can post ideas, argue their points in the comments and vote with satoshis, the smallest denomination of bitcoin, to determine which side wins. When the debate is over, the funds are split by those who voted for the winning side. The business takes about 5% of each prize pool. It has seen about 140,000 satoshis \u2014 or $36.98 \u2014 in payment volume across 1,085 transactions and 30 debates in the past two weeks, co-founder and CEO James Pierog said.\n\nThe platform plans to launch a mobile app by the end of 2023.\n\nCompany: Dustup\n\nWhat is does: Streamlined tournament tools\n\nFounders: Neil Woodfine, Richard Bensberg, Adam Woodfine\n\nThe Pitch: Dustup aims to improve the e-sports competition space through its streamlined tournament tools that integrate bitcoin payments, giving players the ability to pay entry fees and collect prize payouts quickly. The typical registration process for e-sports tournaments is extremely slow and requires a bunch of rerouting, said CEO and co-founder Neil Woodfine, but through the company\u2019s tool, players can register directly in a Discord in less than 30 seconds. The startup also provides automated results and custom scoring, as well as a bot that can help manage battle royale tournaments.\n\nIt\u2019s raising a pre-seed extension round of $350,000.\n\nCompany: ShockNet\n\nWhat it does: Lightning-focused web infrastructure\n\nFounders: Justin Hilton, Hatim Boufnichel\n\nThe Pitch: ShockNet provides infrastructure and tools to bridge web applications with the Lightning Network for quick payments. Its infrastructure connects Lightning micropayments to any app, so people can deliver content and have a means for monetization. The startup is also building its platform, Lightning.video, which uses its technology stack to give creators an opportunity to earn by publishing and monetizing their own content without having to post on platforms like YouTube.\n\nCompany: Route Finance\n\nWhat it does: Corporate treasury operating system\n\nFounders: Nate Castillo, Ramin Keene\n\nThe Pitch: Route is building an operating system for corporate treasuries that lets businesses automate cash management, analysis, forecasting, reconciliation and integrate payments directly into treasury workflows by pulling data from over 170 different integrations. The service provides a programmable financial data platform \u2014 with AI, ML and Bitcoin support \u2014 that will tailor support for advanced treasury workflows.\n\nOver time, the startup wants to power payments through Lightning and Taproot technologies, and \u201cessentially replace Swift\u201d and \u201cbecome the Stripe for treasury,\u201d said Nate Castillo, the company\u2019s co-founder. It has four customers \u2014 Amboss, StackHawk, Denali and Teachable \u2014 in its pilot program. However, after this story published, Amboss\u2019s CFO, Asher Hopp, reached out to TechCrunch+ to clarify that Route pitched Amboss, but there is no formal agreement between them.\n\nLikewise, StackHawk SVP Holly Hamann told us that StackHawk is not one of Route\u2019s customers, either, and is not involved with its program.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Route co-founder Nate Castillo replied, \u201cNone of the companies listed are Route customers, and we are working through the process to formalize our pilot program.\u201d\n\nCompany: Zawda\n\nWhat it does: Preserving paychecks\n\nFounders: Oday Kamal, Javier Vargas\n\nThe Pitch: The Zawda platform helps employees in MENA, Lebanon, Turkey and Pakistan allocate portions of their paychecks to bitcoin and stablecoins directly through their employers to preserve the monetary value.\n\nCountries in the Middle East face high inflation and rising costs, and people in those regions are seeing their local currencies and purchasing power diminish dramatically, said company co-founder Oday Kamal. Its platform requires no tech integration and aims to work with people to improve their ability to maintain currency and offer them a way to receive a small portion of their paycheck in bitcoin to preserve their funds.\n\nIt is starting its pilot phase with the United Arab Emirates and plans to finalize licenses with regulators in the country by the third quarter of 2023; it anticipates exiting that phase by end of year. It also wants to expand paycheck offerings into stablecoins, via Taproot Assets. It later plans to launch in Lebanon, Turkey, Pakistan, as well as add services like remittances, staking and lending.\n\nCompany: Zeus\n\nWhat it does: Bitcoin wallet, node management\n\nFounder: Evan Kaloudis\n\nThe Pitch: Zeus is an open source, noncustodial Bitcoin wallet and node management client that aims to provide a better option for lightning interfaces and node costs. The entire process to set up its wallet takes less than 30 seconds, founder Evan Kaloudis showed during his presentation. The wallet currently has about 10,000 users, making up over 10% of all Lightning Network users. It is also building Olympus by Zeus, a lightning service provider, that aims to offer easier connectivity to the lightning network. The wallet is supported by Eclair, LND and Core Lightning and is integrated by companies like BTC Pay, MyNode and Nodl, among others. It\u2019s looking to raise $2 million to $3 million.\n\nThe TC+ takeaway\n\nAll in all, this demo day was unlike any other crypto demo day I\u2019ve covered. Yes, I said crypto, which Bitcoin maximalists would argue the blockchain is not a part of. However, most crypto-focused demo days have startups that are aiming to grow the crypto ecosystem.\n\nWolf\u2019s demo day was a refreshing change of pace given that a fair amount of the startups were looking to solve real-world problems that exist today. Instead of creating a project that only benefits the Bitcoin network, founders were launching innovations that integrated Bitcoin as a payment solution for something outside of the industry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an explosion of creativity happening in Bitcoin today,\u201d Wolf\u2019s Kelly Brewster said. \u201cPeople in crypto are building for crypto, but these [Bitcoin-focused] projects aim to build something faster and cheaper for the general public.\u201d\n\nWith all this said, it\u2019s still important for Bitcoin developers and founders alike to grow the ecosystem. As other blockchains progress further with subsectors like NFTs and gaming, Bitcoin is lagging behind.\n\nBut in recent months, the Bitcoin ecosystem has seen some renewed interest, with new initiatives like the launch of Ordinals, a Bitcoin-based NFT-like project. To date, over 9 million Bitcoin Ordinals have been inscribed \u2014 jargon for created (or minted) \u2014 according to Dune Analytics data. That amount is up 7,280% from 122,500 in mid-February, signaling explosive growth and demand for Bitcoin-based NFTs.\n\nI\u2019m curious to see whether Bitcoin-focused demo days moving forward will continue to be a mix of real-world projects building with Bitcoin, or if we\u2019ll see an influx of new projects centered around growing the ecosystem, taking a page out of the Ethereum, Solana and Polygon playbooks.\n\nUpdate: This story was updated on May 25 to clarify that Amboss is not one of Route\u2019s current customers. This story was updated again to clarify that StackHawk is not one of Route\u2019s current customers. This story was updated again on May 26 to include Nate Castillo\u2019s comment."

        "content": "Bitcoin NFTs Surpass Solana but Ethereum Retains Top Spot\n\nBitcoin NFTs monthly trading volume exceeded Solana this month, despite Ethereum still holding the top spot with an NFT volume of $393 million (double Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day volume starting April 23). Nevertheless, Bitcoin now overrides notable blockchains like Solana, Polygon, ImmutableX and BNB Chain \u2014 a remarkable achievement for these recently launched collectibles.\n\nOver recent months, the NFT market observed a shift in media-based Bitcoin ordinals, otherwise known as Bitcoin NFTs. Following this success, the popular Bitcoin NFT marketplace, Magic Eden, is competing with UniSat\u2019s volume, the world\u2019s first open-source browser extension wallet for Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nThe implementation of #Bitcoin ordinals spurred NFT activity on $BTC. Over the past 30 days #Bitcoin has seen the second most NFT sales volume among all blockchains: h/t @cryptoslamio pic.twitter.com/q8qnHCcLfD \u2014 Osprey Funds (@OspreyFunds) May 23, 2023\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin\n\nOn the flip side, Bitcoin Frogs has been boosting Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume. For example, Bitcoin Frog #2276 sold for 0.2 BTC ($5388.72) on Magic Eden on May 19. Significant sales like this one have led to the \u201ccrypto amphibians\u201d overriding Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), which only recorded $40 million in trading volume from April 23 to May 23. Regardless, the Bitcoin NFT ecosystem continues to lag behind Ethereum.\n\nOne of the critical reasons Ethereum remains at the peak for monthly trading volume includes holding numerous notable NFT projects: BAYC, Azuki, CryptoPunks and Milady Maker. BAYC and Azuki are NFTs associated with popular metaverse projects, whereas CryptoPunks and Miladys are in high demand due to having limited availability and early market entry. In addition, the blockchain network also supports numerous DAOs and integration benefits, stimulating the decentralized finance ecosystem to be worth $27.5 billion.\n\nDespite Milady already having a name for itself in the NFT realm, this month, the NFT collectibles noticed a rapid surge due to Elon Musk tweeting one of the customized PFPs, assisting Ethereum to continue claiming the prime position.\n\nAs the exciting NFT space continues to shift, progressing developments represent the unpredictability and potential of this blockchain-driven creative space.\n\nWant more?

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nUK losses to crypto fraud increased more than 40 per cent over the past year, surpassing \u00a3300mn for the first time, according to Britain\u2019s fraud reporting agency.\n\nLaw firms said the data, provided by Action Fraud, reflected the scale of cyber crime and the high-profile collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year that triggered a wave of losses among retail investors.\n\nCryptocurrency scams are part of a wider \u201cepidemic\u201d of fraud, which accounted for more than 40 per cent of all reported crimes in England and Wales last year, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nLosses from crypto fraud increased 41 per cent year on year to \u00a3306mn in the 12 months to March 2023 compared with \u00a3216.5mn in the previous year, said law firm RPC, which collected the data from Action Fraud.\n\n\u201cThese numbers show both the impact of crypto fraud on UK investors and more specifically the colossal impact that the collapse of FTX had on UK retail investors,\u201d said Dan Wyatt, partner at RPC.\n\nMore than a third of crypto fraud losses for the year, \u00a3115.7mn, occurred in November 2022, the month FTX filed for bankruptcy. The Bahamas-based business had been valued at $32bn less than a year earlier.\n\nJennifer Craven, fraud expert at law firm Pinsent Masons, said the figures reflected how widespread crypto crime had become.\n\n\u201c[The figures] align with the sharp increase in English High Court actions commenced by victims of crypto fraud who are determined to recover their losses by civil remedial means,\u201d she added.\n\nCryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are largely unregulated in the UK. In February, the Treasury set out draft proposals for the regulation of crypto assets, including new requirements on exchanges to ringfence customers\u2019 money in the event of insolvency.\n\nMPs on the House of Commons\u2019 Treasury select committee said last week that cryptocurrencies should be regulated in a similar way to the gambling sector, given it had \u201cno intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good\u201d.\n\nRPC said the losses could also reflect the collapse of crypto-related Ponzi schemes that were unable to continue as the value of the cryptocurrencies they were based on cratered.\n\nThe value of bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency, fell as low as $15,700 on November 10, 2022, the day before FTX filed for bankruptcy, according to cryptocurrency site CoinGecko.\n\nThe currency is at present valued at $26,200 per bitcoin, down more than 60 per cent since its high of just over $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nIn the UK government\u2019s national fraud strategy, a blueprint released earlier this month for how it will clamp down on financial crime, it pledged to ban cold calls on all financial and investment products.\n\nHowever, many companies said the strategy did not go far enough and called for online platforms, where many scams originate, to face further tougher rules."

        "content": "Bitcoin has been one of the most talked-about topics recently because of its volatile nature. It has seen its fair share of ups and downs, making predicting its future difficult. In comparison, one project currently in Stage 2 of its presale has shown continuous price increases \u2013 Tradecurve (TCRV).\n\nIn this article, we will explore whether ChatGPT, a popular AI chatbot, thinks Bitcoin will reach 35k or not while also looking at what makes Tradecurve so attractive to investors.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nBitcoin (BTC) unable to maintain momentum\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized and anonymous cryptocurrency that allows for quick and straightforward transactions without banks or intermediaries. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has been on the crypto market throne since it is the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is trading hands at $26,796.71 with a market cap of $519B, which is a decrease of 0.38% in the past day alone. In the last month, Bitcoin has been struggling with a fall of 1.5% in its value during that period. ChatGPT cannot predict the future, but it has noted that Bitcoin is a volatile investment that may cause some concerns.\n\nExperts agree that if Bitcoin cannot climb beyond the $27,250 level, a further price decrease is in store. And if it does climb above it, Bitcoin may find a resistance level of $30,000. With these Bitcoin price predictions stating that a $35,000 valuation is not obtainable anytime soon, investors are looking at other projects to diversify their portfolios.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) presale continues capturing all attention\n\nBy creating a unique Ethereum-based hybrid trading exchange that does not require sign-up KYC checks, Tradecurve will become a significant power in the online trading market.\n\nIndividuals, no matter their location, will soon be able to trade stocks, commodities, forex, and cryptocurrency just by creating an account using their email, connecting a crypto wallet, and depositing on Tradecurve. This will be a significant turning point as traditional trading platforms such as Binance and eToro require KYC checks, effectively disabling privacy and anonymity for traders.\n\nTradecurve will also have a social trading feature, allowing users to copy what experienced traders are doing for a small subscription fee. Beginner traders may also find the metaverse trading academy very appealing as they can communicate with trading professionals.\n\nBuilding on the Ethereum blockchain will also have its perks, as individuals will control their keys and assets and enjoy lower trading fees thanks to decentralization. Tradecurve will employ its utility token, TCRV, as the backbone of this platform and features \u2013 providing holders with benefits such as subscription fee discounts, passive income via staking, and exclusive account rewards.\n\nIndividuals have found these benefits very appealing as millions of TCRV tokens have been sold already, and given its current presale price of just $0.012, now is a great time to purchase it.\n\nThis project is now in Stage 2 of its presale and has already seen a price increase of 20% from its starting price of $0.01. Experts forecast that more price hikes will come as they foresee a 50x increase by the time the presale finishes. Moreover, a 100x increase after its launch is not out of the question, as the TCRV token will get listed on a significant Tier-1 exchange such as Uniswap.\n\nAll signs are bullish for Tradecurve, and if we compare it to Huobi\u2019s ICO, which began in 2018 with a price of $1.52 and reached an ATH of $39.81 , a price surge can be expected for the TCRV token soon, so sign up for its presale below and obtain a 25% deposit bonus on each purchase.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve presale see links below:\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurve.io/\n\nBuy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official\n\nShare this article"

        "content": "After a disastrous 2022, this year was supposed to be the year of recovery for the crypto market. The combined market cap of all tokens rose above $1 trillion for the first time in almost a year and the entire sector was pumping, entering a decisive bullish phase.\n\nHowever, some experts claim that the crypto market rally is over. One of the most renowned crypto analysts and investors, going by the name @CryptoCapo_ on Twitter, stated that he expects Bitcoin to drop to $12k. The recent price movement seems to confirm this theory, as BTC fell more than 10% in the last 10 days. Ethereum also suffered losses in this period, but less dire than Bitcoin\n\nWhether this is the beginning of a bearish run for Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies remains to be seen. It is worth noting that some tokens seem unaffected by this slump. New generation cryptos like AiDoge (AIDOGE), EccoTera (ECOTERRA), (YPRED), (LPX), DeeLance(DLANCE), and SpongeBob (SPONGE) are steadily pumping and seem like a sure bet for 2023. Even better, some of these tokens are still in presale so you can get them on the cheap if you hurry up. This will set you up for some massive ROI once they hit the open market and their value explodes.\n\nAiDoge (AIDOGE) \u2013 AI-Powered Meme Generating App\n\nBy combining two of the hottest topics at the moment \u2013 AI and memes \u2013 AiDoge is making sure that it will be an instant hit as soon as it goes online. The app offers a simple and elegant way for users to create popular memes in no time. All you have to do is come up with an idea, input it into the app and the AI under the hood will do the rest.\n\nThe AiDoge presale is one of the biggest surprises of the year so far, having raised more than $12 million in mere weeks.\n\n>>> Buy AiDoge Now<<<\n\nEcoTerra (ECOTERRA) \u2013 The Best Green Crypto on the Market\n\nDesigned to help with the recycling effort, EccoTerra is the world\u2019s first Recyle2Earn app that allows its users to earn crypto while helping save the planet. With the effects of climate change being more and more dire each year, this guarantees that both the app and its native token ECCOTERRA will be immensely popular.\n\nWith $4.2 million raised, ECOTERRA is having an amazing presale. It is widely accepted that early investors stand to make massive gains once it hits the open market. Fortunately, there is still time to get on the EcoTerra bandwagon and secure some of those gains for yourself.\n\n>>> Buy Ecoterra Now<<<\n\nyPredict.ai (YPRED) \u2013 Comprehensive Trading and Analytics Platform\n\nyPredict.ai utilizes a powerful AI to help traders predict and anticipate market trends.

This makes it a perfect gateway point to crypto trading, especially for new traders.\n\nIn addition to news, Launchpad XYZ will also provide its users with analytics and signal intelligence that will help them stay on top of the market trends.\n\nLPX is the native token of the platform and is currently in presale.

With much lower fees and faster transactions, DeeLance addresses two main issues freelancers have with current market solutions.\n\nPowered by its native currency DLANCE, the app offers an easy and cheap solution that allows freelancers to connect with clients and charge for their work. It will also provide a set of tools that will make maintaining their portfolios and advertising their services much easier.\n\nWith more than $1 million raised through presale so far, DeeLance is well on its way toward its hard cap goal and the subsequent first listings on crypto exchanges.

It only took a few days since its launch to achieve cult status, following a massive pump and several key listings.\n\nSPONGE, unlike many of its competitors, has published several key certificates that eliminate any doubt about rug pull or pump-and-dump schemes. This is one of the main reasons why investors trust it and are ready to commit to it long-term.\n\n>>> Buy SpongeBob Token Now<<<\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) \u2013 Scalable Blockchain Network\n\nScalability was one of the most pressing issues plaguing blockchain technology and any platform that offered a solution was bound to be very popular with both investors and users. Avalanche is one of the most prominent infinitely scalable blockchain networks and as such, one of the safer bets on the crypto market.\n\nRipple (XRP) \u2013 Solution for Cheap International Money Transfers\n\nCross-border payments have always been fairly expensive and often lengthy procedures. Ripple offers a much cheaper and faster way of moving money across countries that performs much better than current international banking solutions.\n\nRipple provides a service that isn\u2019t much affected by the usual volatility of the crypto market and as such it tends to be more stable than other tokens. In times like this one, stability is at a premium, which is why we can see XRP gaining in 2023.\n\nConclusion\n\nHopes of a full recovery of the crypto market have been somewhat dashed by yet another slump. Despite the grim Bitcoin prognosis, there are some tokens that seem immune to this. AIDOGE, ECOTERRA, YPRED, LPX, DLANCE, and SPONGE continue their bullish runs and offer an excellent investment options in this time of crisis.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "The anonymity surrounding the blockchain industry plays a fundamental role in its appeal. Many cryptocurrency investors love the industry as they can just have a wallet and remain fully anonymous. This can be helpful in a wide range of situations, and one of the most recent examples of how Bitcoin (BTC) benefited a person was when a husband successfully hid $500,000 worth of Bitcoin from his wife during a divorce.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) is a hybrid exchange with privacy and anonymity in mind that does not require users to complete a KYC procedure. As such, it will be the go-to platform in the minds of many, and today, we will go over exactly how it stands out.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<<\n\nThe Husband that Hid $500,000 in Bitcoin (BTC) During a Divorce\n\nWhenever a person gets divorced, community property is typically divided equally between the spouses, where each spouse gets to keep their separate property. There is also equitable distribution, where the assets and earnings accumulating during marriages will be divided fairly.\n\nLosing half of everything can be difficult for a person who underwent a divorce. But one husband successfully hid his Bitcoin (BTC) balance, worth $500,000. Cryptocurrency wallets utilize a public ledger to maintain their privacy.
