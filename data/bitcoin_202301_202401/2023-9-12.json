        "content": "By increasing the demand on the grid, crypto miners increase the need for demand-response, the cost of such programs, and the cost of providing electricity to all other customers: ERCOT\u2019s independent market monitor expects that Texans could be paying an extra $1.5 billion for electricity in 2023 \u2013 in part to pay cryptocurrency miners to shut down their operations during high demand.\n\nIn Texas, crypto miners can participate in ERCOT\u2019s demand-response program (Responsive Reserve Service) and be paid by the grid operator for agreeing to shut down operations to prevent blackouts. The program pays crypto operations even if they are not actually asked or required to shut down. Many facilities may only shut down for only a few hours a year but can make millions of dollars. Demand-response company Voltus estimates that a cryptocurrency mining company can generate up to 10% of its annual revenue by providing shutdown services to the grid."

        "content": "Global investment firm Franklin Templeton filed for a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, joining BlackRock, Fidelity and others in seeking to start the first bitcoin ETF.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS Franklin Templeton, a $1.45 trillion asset manager, has filed for a bitcoin ETF with the SEC for the first time.\n\nCoinbase has been chosen to act as the custodian for the bitcoin held by the fund; however, a reference rate from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) will be used for pricing.\n\nThe move from Franklin Templeton follows similar applications from other financial titans, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, as the crypto market eagerly awaits the potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe spot bitcoin ETF filing from Franklin Templeton has terms similar to those seen in recent applications from other major players in traditional finance. According to the filing, Coinbase (COIN) will act as the custodian of the bitcoin held by the fund. Additionally, the ETF is to be traded on Cboe BZX Exchange and will use the CME's CF Bitcoin Reference Rate\u2013New York Variant for pricing.\n\nNotably, this is the first attempt by Franklin Templeton, which has roughly $1.45 trillion worth of assets under management, to create a bitcoin ETF product. This is also notable as Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson has said in the past that \"bitcoin is the greatest distraction from the greatest disruption in financial services, which is blockchain.\"\n\nWill Spot Bitcoin ETFs See The Light Of Day?\n\nThe Franklin Templeton filing follows a wave of new spot bitcoin ETF filings that was kicked off by BlackRock (BLK) in June. Excitement has been building around the potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF since then due to BlackRock's reputation and pivotal role in the U.S. financial system. In addition to BlackRock, Fidelity and VanEck have also submitted their own, similar applications. Decisions on these spot bitcoin ETFs and others have been delayed by the SEC until October.\n\nRecently, digital asset firm Grayscale scored a victory in their appeal over the SEC's decision to not allow the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTCUSD) to be turned into a full-fledged ETF. While the SEC must now clarify their reasons for rejecting the transition of GBTC to an ETF, the court ruling does not necessarily mean the change or other ETFs will now be approved.\n\n\"We're still reviewing that decision,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said of the Grayscale ruling at a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee hearing this morning.\n\n\"We have multiple filings around bitcoin exchange-traded products,\" Gensler said, \"we're reviewing them and I'm looking forward to staff's recommendations.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin is now rising after dropping below $25,000 on Monday, with many investors gearing up for the FTX estate to sell billions of dollars in crypto assets back into the market.\n\nThe most popular cryptocurrency, after falling to $24,900, rebounded and was up nearly 1.6%, to about $26,100, on Tuesday morning. The second-most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum, was up less than 1% to about $1,600.\n\nBehind the decline was investor anxiety over potential actions from the FTX bankruptcy estate, which is responsible for more than $3.4 billion in crypto. The estate is keen to unload it to recover as much as possible for the firm\u2019s creditors. Last month, under its new CEO, the bankruptcy expert John J. Ray III, the company asked permission of the court overseeing its case to hire Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital Capital Management to help it start selling, staking, and hedging crypto assets.\n\nUnder the plan FTX submitted to its bankruptcy court, the company would be allowed to sell up to $100 million in tokens per week, a figure that could increase to $200 million for specific tokens. The plan must still be approved by the bankruptcy court.\n\nThe company owned an estimated $268 million in Bitcoin as of January, according to Decrypt, and offloading too quickly could depress prices. Likely, though, more pain would be inflicted on smaller cryptocurrencies like Solana and Polygon, of which it owns an estimated $685 million and $39 million, respectively, that could potentially be unloaded."

        "title": "How IRS-CI Seized Billions From Silk Road Hacker James Zhong - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "In November 2021, IRS Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) seized 50,676 Bitcoin from James Zhong, an American who pled guilty to wire fraud for stealing that Bitcoin from the darknet market Silk Road in September 2012. With a value of $3.36 billion, this marks one of the largest cryptocurrency seizures in history.\n\nWe commend the IRS-CI agents who led this investigation, as well as the DOJ lawyers who were able to achieve a guilty plea from Zhong. We\u2019re also proud to say that Chainalysis\u2019 own Aaron Bice assisted agents with the case, using Chainalysis Reactor and other proprietary tools to trace Zhong\u2019s attempts to launder the funds, and performing forensic database analysis to help agents identify Zhong and build their case against him. Below, we\u2019ll share more about Zhong\u2019s theft, money laundering strategy, and the investigation itself.\n\nThe hack of Silk Road, from theft to seizure\n\nActive between 2011 and 2013, Silk Road was the first major crypto-powered darknet market, and at its peak accounted for over 20% of Bitcoin\u2019s daily economic activity. While Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht was arrested in 2013, it wasn\u2019t until November 2021 that authorities would catch James Zhong, the person who stole 50,000 Bitcoin from the infamous darknet market in 2012.\n\nZhong pulled off the theft by exploiting a flaw in Silk Road\u2019s Bitcoin withdrawal mechanism for vendors. According to the Department of Justice (DOJ), Zhong set up fake Silk Road vendor accounts solely for this purpose, never actually listing anything for sale. Zhong funded the address associated with each vendor account with between 200 and 2,000 Bitcoin, and soon after would initiate multiple transactions to withdraw that amount in a matter of milliseconds. By doing this several times over several days, he was able to trick Silk Road\u2019s system into letting him withdraw more than he deposited, ultimately stealing 50,000 Bitcoin. We can see the results of this activity on the Chainalysis Reactor graph below.\n\nSoon after the theft, Zhong consolidated his 50,000 Bitcoin in two wallets, with 40,000 Bitcoin in one and 10,000 in the other. The funds sat untouched for over a year, until he gradually moved them to new wallets over several years from October 2013 to May 2019. Between December 2020 and January 2021, Zhong also moved a portion of the funds to a mixing service in an effort to obfuscate the flow of funds.\n\nWe should also note that Zhong gained an additional 50,000 in Bitcoin Cash \u2014 the equivalent of his stolen Bitcoin holdings \u2014 when the Bitcoin Cash hard fork occurred in 2017. Soon after, Zhong exchanged that 50,000 Bitcoin Cash for 3,500 Bitcoin, bringing his total illicit holdings to 53,500 Bitcoin, a portion of which was also seized later.\n\nEventually, Zhong attempted to liquidate a portion of the stolen funds at a centralized cryptocurrency exchange in 2020. During that process, an address that had received funds directly from the Silk Road hack was included on the input side of a transaction along with an address easily traced to Zhong, allowing investigators to ascertain that Zhong controlled both. Additionally, the compliance team at that exchange provided law enforcement with the KYC information and IP address linked to the account associated with these transactions, which also led back to Zhong. Agents raided Zhong\u2019s Gainesville, Georgia home in November 2021, finding 50,491 Bitcoin on devices hidden in a floor safe and, on the lower end of Zhong\u2019s security measures, inside of a popcorn tin stuffed under blankets. Agents also turned up over $660,000 in cash, precious metals, and 25 Casascius coins, which are physical representations of Bitcoin containing private keys to access actual Bitcoin. Zhong voluntarily turned over another 861 Bitcoin in March 2022 and May 2022. In November 2022, he pled guilty to charges of wire fraud stemming from this theft, and was sentenced to just over a year in prison in April 2023.\n\nSeizures are key in the fight against cryptocurrency-based crime\n\nIt should go without saying that no one has the right to steal money just because it was obtained through criminal activity. More importantly, this case shows how far law enforcement has progressed in its ability to follow and seize cryptocurrency associated with crime, even when criminals go to great lengths to hide it, and even when the activity in question occurred years in the past. The blockchain is forever, so investigators can always return to old, suspicious transactions and investigate them using the latest methods.\n\nAmerican law enforcement agencies \u2014 primarily IRS-CI but others as well \u2014 have now seized billions in digital assets, which should show would-be cybercriminals that cryptocurrency isn\u2019t the anonymous, untraceable asset they may hope it is. In fact, the immutable and public nature of blockchains means that cryptocurrency is usually easier to trace than fiat. We look forward to continuing our support of IRS-CI, the DOJ, and other law enforcement and prosecuting agencies around the world as they continue to progress in their ability to solve cryptocurrency-based crime."

        "content": "Bitcoin only exchange Bull Bitcoin, has announced that it has expanded its services to enable Costa Ricans and foreigners to buy and sell Bitcoin using SINPE Movil, the country's primary fiat payment system, in partnership with circular BTC economy project Bitcoin Jungle, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. This collaboration not only opens up new opportunities for those looking to utilize Bitcoin in the country but also simplifies the process of converting Costa Rican colones to BTC and vice versa.\n\nBull Bitcoin is now the first and only Bitcoin exchange in Costa Rica to facilitate seamless transactions using SINPE Movil, the payment network widely embraced by over an estimated 90% of Costa Rican consumers. This development represents a significant milestone, as it grants nearly every Costa Rican access to a secure, low-cost, instant on-ramp and off-ramp for Bitcoin.\n\nFor the first time, residents and visitors alike can effortlessly convert colones to Bitcoin and Bitcoin to colones without the hassle of complex international bank transfers and expensive currency conversion fees. Additionally, Bull Bitcoin allows for conversions to and from bank accounts (IBAN) in both CRC and USD via regular bank transfers, further enhancing the flexibility of Bitcoin usage.\n\nBitcoin Jungle, an open-source community project tailored for Costa Rica, has been instrumental in onboarding hundreds of local merchants, including independent vendors at farmers' markets, into the Bitcoin ecosystem over the past three years. In some regions, like Bahia Ballena, Bitcoin Jungle has effectively established a circular Bitcoin economy.\n\nHowever, one major challenge faced by Bitcoin Jungle was the inability to \"cash out\" Bitcoin for local currency, which hindered broader adoption among merchants. Bull Bitcoin's integration into the Bitcoin Jungle wallet solves this issue by enabling merchants to easily convert their Bitcoin holdings to fiat currency, bolstering their confidence in accepting Bitcoin payments.\n\nTo take advantage of this service, users must download the Bitcoin Jungle wallet and register a username. Within the wallet's settings, they can select the SINPE Movil option to access the buy and sell Bitcoin interface. Purchasing Bitcoin requires a SINPE Movil account, available to Costa Rican citizens and residents, and entails sending funds to Bull Bitcoin's phone number, after which Bitcoin is automatically credited to their Bitcoin Jungle wallet.\n\nThis partnership between Bull Bitcoin and Bitcoin Jungle not only simplifies financial transactions in Costa Rica but also helps to position the country as an internationally recognized Bitcoin hub. By offering locals, tourists, and expats a convenient Bitcoin standard for everyday transactions, Bull Bitcoin and Bitcoin Jungle are driving the adoption of BTC in this vibrant Central American nation.\n\nBull Bitcoin\u2019s entry in the Costa Rica Bitcoin market officially starts its long-awaited international expansion. Over the next 12 months, the exchange will become available to over a billion people worldwide, according to the release. After almost 10 years of being available only in Canada and serving a market of 35 million individuals, Bull Bitcoin says they're ready to offer its internationally-acclaimed services to users across the world.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

It intends to \u201creflect generally the performance of the price of bitcoin before payment of the fund\u2019s expenses.\u201d\n\nThe ETF\u2019s shares would be backed by bitcoin held by Coinbase Custody Trust Company, the fund\u2019s custodian.\n\nA spokesperson for Franklin Templeton declined to comment beyond the filing.\n\nThe proposal joins a long list of such applications currently before the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nArk and 21Shares re-filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in April, about two months before asset management titan BlackRock shared plans to launch a similar offering. BlackRock\u2019s entrance into the bitcoin ETF pursuit prompted Fidelity, Invesco, Bitwise and a handful of other issuers to also retry their own attempts.\n\nThough issuers have long sought to bring to the US market an ETF that holds bitcoin directly, the SEC has never permitted one to begin trading.\n\nFranklin Templeton\u2019s filing comes a couple weeks after Grayscale Investments won a case against the SEC in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe judges in that case said the SEC\u2019s denial of Grayscale\u2019s conversion of its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF \u2014 while allowing bitcoin futures ETFs to come to market \u2014 was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d Though the decision does not force the SEC to approve the GBTC conversion, the judges told the agency it can\u2019t deny the conversion with the reasons it previously used.\n\nRead more: What Grayscale\u2019s win against the SEC actually means\n\nSome industry watchers told Blockworks they believed the ruling positively impacted the chances that the SEC would approve a spot bitcoin ETF at some point \u2014 perhaps by as early as the end of the year.\n\nThe decision prompted Bloomberg Intelligence analysts, for example, to up the likelihood of bitcoin ETF approval from 65% to 75% by the end of 2023. The analysts wrote in an August research note they believe there is a 95% chance such a product launches in the US by the end of 2024.\n\nFranklin Templeton is not exactly a stranger to the crypto space.\n\nRoger Bayston, the firm\u2019s head of digital assets, told Blockworks in June that blockchain technology is set to be \u201ctransformational\u201d for capital markets. The firm has a mutual fund that utilizes the Stellar and Polygon blockchains.\n\nUpdated Sept. 12, 2023 at 10:12 am ET: Added context about Roger Bayston.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies moved up, with Solana spearheading the winners with a 24-hour rise of over 2%. The rally followed the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) release on Wednesday, which showed an acceleration in the annual inflation rate in August, while the core CPI that excludes food and energy prices posed a deceleration. U.S. stock futures traded higher, after Wall Street closed mixed on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin reclaims US$26,000; altcoins stable after bankrupt FTX received approval to liquidate\n\nBitcoin rose 1.45% in the last 24 hours to US$26,251.64 as of 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, adding 1.88% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reclaimed the US$26,000 support level on Wednesday afternoon and touched a daily high of over US$26,370 on early Thursday morning.\n\nDespite reclaiming the key US$26,000 line, Bitcoin\u2019s momentum has seemingly weakened on Tuesday, but is \u201cstill strong enough to hold on to most of what was reclaimed after the bounce,\u201d Keith Alan, co-founder of monitoring resource Material Indicators, tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin still faces multiple technical resistances, including a \u201cdeath cross\u201d between the token\u2019s 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages \u2013 which currently sit at US$27,444 and US$27,670, as well as a 100-day moving average at US$28,292 that outlines the ceiling of the range, according to Alan on Tuesday.\n\nEther also gained 0.95% to US$1,609.32 but still traded 1.64% lower in the past seven days. The second top crypto reached a 24-hour high of US$1,619.11 on Tuesday night.\n\nBitcoin and Ether prices briefly dipped on early Thursday morning in Asia after the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX received court approval to sell its US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets. The selling is capped at US$100 million per week, which can be extended to US$200 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nFTX\u2019s current crypto holdings include US$1.16 billion in Solana\u2019s SOL and US$560 million in Bitcoin, according to a Monday court filing.\n\nDespite the incoming FTX liquidation, crypto prices remain largely stable. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted gains in the past 24 hours. SOL led the winners, which rose 2.70% to US$18.43 but lost 6.70% for the week.\n\nVisa wrote in a Tuesday research report that Solana blockchain \u201chas attributes like high transaction throughput and scalability at low cost that help make it a good candidate for payments and Visa\u2019s stablecoin settlement pilot.\u201d The global payment giant announced a partnership with Solana on Sept. 5 to expand its USDC stablecoin settlement pilot to Solana\u2019s blockchain\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 1.07% in the past 24 hours to US$1.04 trillion, while trading volume dropped 21.30% to US$27.63 billion.\n\n\u201cThe recent stability could be attributed to steady CPI data, as is common amongst high-risk asset classes,\u201d said John Stefanidis, CEO and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure DAO, Balthazar DAO.\n\n\u201cMoreover, it seems the crypto market may have already priced in the potential ramifications of FTX\u2019s approved sale of its substantial $3.4 billion crypto asset portfolio,\u201d added Stefanidis.\n\nU.S. annual inflation rate accelerates\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading higher as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, after Wall Street closed mixed on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite logging gains while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging lower.\n\nMost main stock indexes in Asia rose on Thursday morning. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 all logged gains, while China\u2019s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.03%.\n\nThe U.S. CPI release on Wednesday sent mixed information to the market. The inflation gauge rose 3.7% by year in August, an acceleration from 3.2% in July. The August CPI also booked a monthly gain of 0.6%, the biggest increase since June 2022.\n\nThe accelerated CPI growth aligns with analysts\u2019 expectation, according to Reuters on Thursday. Gasoline price, which jumped 10.6% in August, accounted for over 50% of the CPI growth in the month.\n\nMeanwhile, the core CPI \u2014 which excludes the volatile food and energy prices \u2014 rose 4.3% by year in August, a deceleration from 4.7% in July and the smallest reading since September 2021.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing here to seriously put a Fed rate hike on the table next week, but there is enough to keep the debate about the need for one more hike in 2023 alive,\u201d Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at U.S.-based investment bank Brean Capital, told Reuters.\n\nGiven the mixed CPI data, J.P.Morgan Asset Management wrote on Wednesday it expects the Federal Reserve to make no further interest rate hike in this monetary tightening cycle.\n\n\u201cDespite still rising oil prices in early September, we expect the impact of oil price spikes on CPI to be limited,\u201d J.P.Morgan\u2019s Chief Global Strategist David Kelly said in a note viewed by Reuters, who expects the annual inflation rate will fall below the Fed\u2019s long-term goal of 2% by the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 97% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in its meeting on Sept. 20, which is currently in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%. It gives a 58.4% chance for another pause in November, up from 56.8% on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. August producer price index (PPI) is set to be released on Thursday, with analysts expecting the data to rise 1.2% by year, up from 0.8% in July. The data will provide further insights into the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\n(Updates with equity section, comment from Stefanidis.)"

        "content": "Use our interactive map to see where your country ranks on the 2023 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index.\n\nThis post is an excerpt from our 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report. Download your copy now!\n\nWe\u2019re excited to unveil the fourth annual Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index. The goal of the index is simple: We combine on-chain data and real-world data to measure which countries are leading the world in grassroots crypto adoption. Grassroots crypto adoption isn\u2019t about which countries have the highest raw transaction volumes \u2014 anyone could probably guess that the biggest, wealthiest countries are far ahead there. Instead, we want to highlight the countries where average, everyday people are embracing crypto the most. To do that, we\u2019ve designed the Global Crypto Adoption Index to identify countries where the most people are putting the greatest share of their wealth into cryptocurrency. We\u2019ll explain the full methodology below, then provide the top 20 countries on our index, along with a few key takeaways.\n\nKeep reading, and we\u2019ll discuss:\n\nOur Global Crypto Adoption Index methodology\n\nThe Global Crypto Adoption Index is made up of five sub-indexes. Each of those sub-indexes is based on countries\u2019 usage of different types of cryptocurrency services. We rank all 154 countries for which we have sufficient data on each sub-index, weight the rankings by characteristics like population size and purchasing power, take the geometric mean of each country\u2019s ranking in all five, and then normalize that final number on a scale of 0 to 1 to give every country a score that determines the overall rankings. The closer the country\u2019s final score is to 1, the higher the rank.\n\nIn order to calculate our sub-indexes, we estimate countries\u2019 transaction volumes for different types of cryptocurrency services and protocols based on the web traffic patterns of those services\u2019 and protocols\u2019 websites. We acknowledge that web traffic data isn\u2019t perfect. Some crypto users are almost certainly employing VPNs and other tools that mask online activity. But given that our index takes into account hundreds of millions of transactions and 13 billion web visits, we\u2019re confident that any misattributed transaction volume due to VPNs is too small to compromise the data as a whole. We also vet our index with local crypto experts and operators around the world, giving us more confidence in this methodology.\n\nBelow is a description of each sub-index, how it\u2019s calculated, and why we believe it\u2019s valuable for measuring grassroots crypto adoption.\n\nOn-chain cryptocurrency value received at centralized exchanges, weighted by purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita\n\nThe goal of this sub-index is to rank each country by total cryptocurrency activity occurring on centralized crypto exchanges, and weight the rankings to favor countries where that amount is more significant based on the income of the average person in that country. We calculate this by estimating the total cryptocurrency received on-chain by users of centralized services in each country, and weighting that value based on PPP per capita, which is a measure of the country\u2019s income per resident. The higher the ratio of on-chain value received to PPP per capita, the higher the ranking. In other words, if two countries received equal amounts of cryptocurrency at centralized services, the country with lower PPP per capita would rank ahead.\n\nOn-chain retail value received at centralized exchanges, weighted by PPP per capita\n\nThe goal of this metric is to measure the activity of non-professional, individual cryptocurrency users at centralized services, based on how much cryptocurrency they\u2019re transacting compared to the purchasing power of the average person. We do this by measuring the amount of cryptocurrency received at centralized services by users in each country, similar to the above, but only counting value received in retail-sized transactions, which we designate as transactions under $10,000 USD worth of cryptocurrency. We then rank each country according to this metric but weight it to favor countries with a lower PPP per capita.\n\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) exchange trade volume, weighted by PPP per capita and number of internet users\n\nP2P trade volume makes up a significant percentage of all cryptocurrency activity in emerging markets. For this sub-index, we rank countries by their P2P trade volume and weight it to favor countries with lower PPP per capita and fewer internet users, the goal being to highlight countries where more residents are putting a larger share of their overall income and wealth into P2P cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nOn-chain cryptocurrency value received from DeFi protocols, weighted by PPP per capita\n\nDeFi (decentralized finance) is the cutting edge of cryptocurrency. Given the sector\u2019s importance to innovation in crypto, we want our adoption index to highlight countries where users are conducting a disproportionately high share of their financial activity using DeFi protocols. For this sub-index, we rank countries by their DeFi transaction volume, and weight the rankings to favor countries with lower PPP per capita.\n\nOn-chain retail value received from DeFi protocols, weighted by PPP per capita\n\nWe want our index to highlight the DeFi activity of non-professional, individual cryptocurrency users, just as we do for centralized services. So, this sub-index ranks each country by DeFi transaction volume carried out in retail-sized transfers, weighted to favor countries with lower PPP per capita.\n\nThe 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index Top 20\n\nCountry Region Overall index ranking Centralized service value received ranking Retail centralized service value received ranking P2P exchange trade volume ranking DeFi value received ranking Retail DeFi value received ranking India Central & Southern Asia and Oceania 1 1 1 5 1 1 Nigeria Sub-Saharan Africa 2 3 2 1 4 4 Vietnam Central & Southern Asia and Oceania 3 4 4 2 3 3 United States North America 4 2 8 12 2 2 Ukraine Eastern Europe 5 5 3 11 10 10 Philippines Central & Southern Asia and Oceania 6 6 6 19 7 7 Indonesia Central & Southern Asia and Oceania 7 13 13 14 5 5 Pakistan Central & Southern Asia and Oceania 8 7 7 9 20 20 Brazil Latin America 9 9 11 15 11 11 Thailand Central & Southern Asia and Oceania 10 8 15 44 6 6 China Eastern Asia 11 10 5 13 23 23 Turkey Middle East & North Africa 12 11 9 35 12 12 Russia Eastern Europe 13 12 10 36 9 9 United Kingdom Central, Northern, & Western Europe 14 15 20 38 8 8 Argentina Latin America 15 14 12 29 19 19 Mexico Latin America 16 17 18 30 16 16 Bangladesh Central & Southern Asia and Oceania 17 18 19 33 22 22 Japan Eastern Asia 18 22 21 49 18 18 Canada North America 19 25 23 62 14 14 Morocco Middle East & North Africa 20 27 25 21 26 26\n\nThe first key takeaway here is that the Central & Southern Asia and Oceania (CSAO) region dominates the top of the index, with six of the top ten countries located in the region. As we explore in the full report, the circumstances driving adoption in each CSAO country are unique, which leads to different usage trends and breakdowns of most popular services.\n\nGlobal adoption is down, but not in one crucial subset of the world\n\nThere\u2019s no sugarcoating it: Worldwide grassroots crypto adoption is down. We can see this on the chart below, where we apply our Adoption Index methodology globally by summing all 154 countries\u2019 index scores for each quarter from Q3 2020 to the present, and re-index them again to show adoption growth over time across the world.\n\nWhile there\u2019s been a marked recovery since the doldrums of late 2022, around the time FTX imploded, grassroots adoption is still well off its all-time highs.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t true everywhere. More specifically, there\u2019s one crucial segment of countries where grassroots adoption has seen a much stronger recovery than anywhere else: Lower middle income (LMI) countries. LMI is one of four designations used by the World Bank to classify countries by income level, based on gross national income (GNI) per capita. Those categories are as follows:\n\nWorld Bank income classification GNI per capita range Example countries High income (HI) > $13,205 USA, UK, Saudi Arabia Upper middle income (UMI) $4,256 \u2013 $13,205 Argentina, China, Russia Lower middle income (LMI) $1,086 \u2013 $4,255 India, Nigeria, Ukraine Low income (LI) < $1,085 Ethiopia, Sudan, Yemen\n\nMany of the top countries on our Global Crypto Adoption Index, from Central & Southern Asia to Africa, are in the LMI category, and taken together, LMI countries have seen the greatest recovery in grassroots crypto adoption over the last year. In fact, LMI is the only category of countries whose total grassroots adoption remains above where it was in Q3 2020, just prior to the most recent bull market.\n\nThis could be extremely promising for crypto\u2019s future prospects. LMI countries are often countries on the rise, with dynamic, growing industries and populations. Many of them have undergone significant economic development in the last few decades to rise from the low income group. And perhaps most importantly of all, 40% of the world\u2019s population live in LMI countries \u2014 more than any other income category. If LMI countries are the future, then the data indicates that crypto is going to be a big part of that future. That, combined with the fact that institutional adoption \u2014 primarily driven by organizations in high-income countries \u2014 continues to gain steam even during the ongoing crypto winter, paints a promising picture of the future. We could see a combination of bottom up and top down cryptocurrency adoption in the near future if these trends hold, as digital assets fulfill the unique needs of individuals in both segments. We\u2019ll explore these trends and more in our full 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report.\n\nThis material is for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide legal, tax, financial, or investment advice.

        "content": "The price of bitcoin bounced Tuesday, reversing losses from the previous day that were driven by fears around FTX liquidations.\n\nBitcoin was last higher by 4.5% at $26,185.72, according to Coin Metrics. On Monday, bitcoin dipped below the key $25,000 support level for the first time since March. The rebound could be fueled in part by investors who were betting against the crypto asset scrambling to cover short positions, in other words, by a short squeeze.\n\nInvestors have been selling their crypto in anticipation of a hearing Wednesday in which liquidators could be permitted to start selling the assets of FTX and Alameda Research, its sister company. The tokens native to the Solana and Polygon networks are among some of the company's biggest holdings. On Monday, they fell 3% and 5%, respectively. On Tuesday, they were last higher by about 2.5% each.\n\nThere's still room for disappointment, however. Fairlead Strategies' Katie Stockton said weakened momentum in the intermediate term could make it difficult for bitcoin to see a durable recovery. With Tuesday's bounce, the cryptocurrency's next level to test on the upside is $27,600 \u2014 its 50-day moving average.\n\nFTX liquidations aside, the crypto market has recently struggled for meaningful catalysts as investors wait for clearer regulation and attention has shifted back to inflation and economic inputs after a string of stronger-than-expected data points last week renewed concern that the Federal Reserve could raise rates once more before year-end.\n\nThis week, investors get the August consumer price index and producer price index readings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively."

        "content": "Scott Purcell, the founder and CEO of Fortress Trust, a custodian that safeguards customers\u2019 crypto, told Fortune that his firm lost $12 million to $15 million in crypto in a recent hack. Most of that was Bitcoin, but small amounts of USDC and USDT, the two largest stablecoins by market capitalization, also were stolen.\n\n\u201cIt was $12 to $15 million out of billions, and we covered it right away,\u201d he told Fortune, in reference to the total amount of stolen crypto compared to the amount Fortress Trust holds in custody for customers. \u201cIt was only really four customers out of 225,000 customers.\u201d\n\nPurcell\u2019s previously unreported admission follows a report from The Block that crypto giant Ripple reimbursed customers affected by the hack as part of its recently announced acquisition of Fortress Trust. The crypto custodian had previously said the security breach resulted in \u201cno loss of funds.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Ripple declined to comment on the extent of the security breach but said that \u201cthe amount used to cover customer funds was baked into the deal.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 7, Fortress disclosed that four \u201cFortress customers were impacted by a third-party vendor whose cloud tools were compromised\u201d and wrote that \u201cimpacted accounts were fully restored.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Ripple announced its acquisition of Fortress, with CEO Brad Garlinghouse saying in a statement that the firm has \u201cbuilt an impressive business with recurring revenue and a strong roster of both crypto-native and new-to-crypto customers.\u201d\n\nAt the time of announcement, neither Ripple nor Fortress Trust disclosed that Ripple had agreed to make customers whole as part of the deal. In The Block\u2018s report on the added wrinkle to the tie-up, a spokesperson for Ripple said that conversations \u201caccelerated last week following the security incident via a third-party analytics vendor, but this opportunity makes sense for Ripple in the long term.\u201d\n\nPurcell, the former CEO of Prime Trust, another crypto custodian that went belly up after it was alleged to be misusing customer funds amid a security breach, declined to identify the four customers affected by the hack or the \u201cthird-party vendor whose cloud tools were compromised.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019d imagine, the first few days were complex and involved (and continue to involve) the F.B.I., Secret Service, regulators and others,\u201d Purcell told Fortune in an email. \u201cWe brought in cybersecurity teams who are very experienced with these things to sweep the system and ensure nothing else was affected.\u201d\n\nPurcell repeatedly emphasized that fault for the security breach was with the third-party vendor, not Fortress Trust, or the company\u2019s custody partners, Fireblocks or BitGo.\n\nA spokesperson for Fireblocks did not confirm the extent of the security breach to Fortune. \u201cWe can confirm that the breach happened on a third-party service with a preconfigured automated authorization and that the Fireblocks platform behaved according to the configuration,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nBitGo CEO Mike Belshe previously posted on X (formerly Twitter) that the incident had \u201cnothing to do with BitGo.\u201d He added: \u201cThe real victims here are Fortress\u2019 clients who deserved enough respect to get the whole truth. They are not to be blamed.\u201d\n\nPurcell, the CEO of Fortress Trust, told Fortune that BitGo had also been in the running to acquire his company: \u201cAs you\u2019ve seen from his sour-grapes tweets, Mike Belshe has chosen to violate our NDA to essentially whine about me not selling the trust company to him.\u201d"

        "content": "\u201cBitcoin fans have a new presidential candidate to throw their weight behind,\u201d read the first line in a recent newsletter by Decrypt, a U.S.-based cryptocurrency site. The rest was no less gushing in its praise of Javier Milei, the upset front-runner in Argentina\u2019s presidential election.\n\nMilei is a far-right libertarian, a fan of Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro \u2014 and, crucially, the candidate that wants to take Argentina in the most radically new economic direction. He is known for being amenable to crypto, saying that \u201cBitcoin represents money\u2019s return to its original maker: the private sector.\u201d\n\nHowever, at the core of his policies lies not cryptocurrency, but dollarization. Decrypt\u2019s enthusiasm for Milei might therefore be misplaced: If he did replace the peso with the U.S. dollar, it may potentially mean a much less crypto-friendly Argentina.\n\nFor a while now, Argentina has weathered inflation that is well over 100% and rising. The government has put strict controls on U.S. dollars entering the country, resulting in a thriving black market. Virtually every story Rest of World publishes about Argentina contains an explanatory paragraph on its bizarre and dire monetary situation. This is not only because currency issues are one of the main problems facing every single person in the country on a day-to-day basis, but also because they determine how and why Argentines adopt tech in weird and wonderful ways.\n\nCrypto is no exception.\n\nArgentina is a major adopter of crypto on the world stage, with around a third of the population actively using it on a daily basis. But it is the economic crisis that has determined how and why the country adopted crypto. Unlike the U.S. and Europe \u2014 places with stable currencies where crypto has, in recent years, been seen as an investment tool \u2014 Argentines use it as a store of value. Getting their hands on foreign currency is very difficult, and keeping their pesos in a bank is a surefire way of seeing all their worth evaporate. In terms of crypto adoption, Argentina has even overtaken El Salvador, the country where President Nayib Bukele rushed to introduce bitcoin as a national currency in 2021.\n\nLike Milei, Bukele was met with rapturous applause by the crypto community. But the two actually couldn\u2019t be more different while still sitting within the \u201cpro-crypto\u201d camp.\n\nBukele supports one specific crypto project: bitcoin. Milei seems more interested in defending people\u2019s right to use any crypto (even if he has been bullish on bitcoin).\n\nBukele seems to have used bitcoin as a tool to distance himself from the constraints dollarization placed on El Salvador; Milei wants to dollarize Argentina\u2019s economy.\n\nBukele has encouraged Salvadorans to store their crypto in a government-linked wallet; Milei says he hates this sort of government interventionism, which is why he is happy to relinquish sovereignty by giving up the peso.\n\nUltimately, because dollarization \u2014 not crypto \u2014 is what truly appeals to Milei, his crypto-fans might end up disappointed. Dollarization will inevitably have many unexpected side effects, including for crypto\u2019s use case. In a dollarized Argentina, how many would stick to crypto if the main reason they used it was so their money wouldn\u2019t lose its value? The dollar could well take on that role."

        "content": "Crypto Nodes: What Are They And How Do They Work?\n\nRead 5 min Medium\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Public blockchains use a decentralized infrastructure that relies on a network of computers called nodes, rather than centralized servers like the internet.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Crypto nodes maintain the latest record of blockchain networks and consistently verify and approve new transactions. They also ensure that everyone follows the rules set forth by the network.\n\n\n\n\u2014 There are many types of nodes with differing use-cases, such as miner and validator nodes which create and propose new blocks.\n\n\n\n\u2014 In this article, we dive into what a crypto node is, how they work, and what they mean for blockchain transactions.\n\nCrypto nodes: They are the unsung heroes of the blockchain, the whole reason decentralized networks are even possible. Their job is simple; they offer ways to propose, approve and process transactions without a centralized entity.\n\nWithout nodes, you couldn\u2019t use the blockchain for all sorts of decentralized purposes such as DAOs or even just the peer-to-peer transfer of digital assets. Essentially, nodes make sure transactions are correct every time, and processed effectively. Since the blockchain is immutable\u2013or at least it\u2019s extremely difficult to alter or tamper with a blockchain transaction\u2013getting it right the first time is important. In fact, the security of the network depends on it!\n\nHowever, no one said getting thousands of computers to agree on something was an easy feat. Ensuring every transaction is correct and relying on a network of strangers is a difficult task, and as a result, the way each blockchain approaches crypto nodes can differ slightly. Each network offers different incentives (and punishments) for their actions on a network or even ways of approving transactions. This all affects how the nodes work, how many there are in a network, and even the types of different nodes there are.\n\nSo in this article, we\u2019ll dive into crypto nodes, explaining what they do, their different types and the difference between miners and nodes.\n\nBut before we get there, let\u2019s start with the basics. In fact, what are crypto nodes exactly?\n\nWhat Is a Crypto Node?\n\nA crypto node is a single computer that can interact with and is part of, a blockchain network. On most blockchains, each node is a single and separate computer which stores all of the information on the blockchain, also known as a distributed ledger. Since every node has a copy of the same information, they can verify each other.\n\nThis allows the nodes to verify and record new transactions and broadcast them to the network without the help of a central entity.\n\nThe more crypto nodes you have, the more difficult it becomes to cheat the entire system. That\u2019s because tampering with a blockchain will\u2014more often than not\u2014require a bad actor to control over 51% of the nodes. This becomes practically impossible on popular networks, simply due to the sheer number of nodes you would have to control.\n\nWhat Is a Crypto Node For?\n\nFirstly, crypto nodes store the data necessary for a blockchain to operate. This can include the entire distributed ledger and all of its transactions. The other important job crypto nodes have is communicating with each other. This is integral to keep the nodes in consensus, i.e. making sure every node has the same copy of the chain. It\u2019s basically the method the nodes use to synchronize, making sure the blockchain is the same for everyone.\n\nBeyond that, some crypto nodes also have other jobs, such as verifying blockchain transactions and rejecting those that don\u2019t fit the mold. Plus they can also offer a copy of the blockchain to any new node that wishes to join the network.\n\nEssentially, these capabilities work together to allow crypto nodes to verify and record transactions without a central entity. Instead of working like traditional finance, public blockchains rely on the power of the collective: People all around the world operating nodes.\n\nCrypto Nodes Vs Miners Vs Validators: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nVery often, the words \u2018nodes\u2019 and \u2018miners\u2019 are used interchangeably in crypto, but they\u2019re not the same thing. So, let\u2019s clarify that confusing point now:\n\nA miner is a dedicated computer system that can add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. To mine new coins or validate transactions, this miner must solve the puzzle\u2013a complex mathematical computation\u2013which requires a considerable amount of energy. This crypto mining mechanic is what keeps a proof-of-work blockchain secure. Simply, bitcoin mining is too costly to consider trying to cheat the system.\n\nThis is where it may be confusing to some, as each miner is a node. However, not every node is a miner. For example, anyone can run a crypto node to help the Bitcoin consensus run without mining a single coin. Plus, beyond those distinctions, there are also differences across different types of networks too.\n\nFor example, on proof-of-stake networks, nodes are operated by validators instead of miners. But even on proof-of-stake networks you can also set up your own node without validating transactions. Thus nodes and validators are not synonymous either.\n\nTypes of Crypto Nodes\n\nThere are 2 main types of nodes: Full Nodes and Light Nodes. Each of these exists for separate reasons and has different capabilities.\n\nFull Node\n\nPut simply, a full node stores a full copy of the network\u2019s digital ledger. These types of crypto nodes build the foundations for most blockchains; storing the history of the chain and communicating with other full nodes. These are also the nodes responsible for providing a copy of the chain to new nodes: They really are the backbone of a network, which is why most blockchains will have these types of nodes.\n\nMiner Nodes\n\nMiner nodes are the participants responsible for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain on a proof-of-work blockchain. Mining requires a lot of computational power to solve complex puzzles. However, they also receive cryptocurrency rewards in return for their work.\n\nValidator Nodes\n\nValidator nodes are similar to miner nodes, but on a proof-of-stake network instead: They also validate transactions and create blocks. However, they don\u2019t have to solve complex computational problems, they are chosen in relation to the amount of funds they lock in the system. Like miners though, they also receive rewards for creating blocks.\n\nLight Nodes\n\nSPV clients, also called light nodes, are a little different. Firstly, these types of nodes do not store the entire blockchain like their heavyweight counterparts. Instead, they just download \u2018block headers\u2019. Without getting too technical, it means they don\u2019t require as much storage capacity. Instead, these crypto nodes\u2019 only task is to verify transactions in the blockchain using simplified payment verification (SPV). It\u2019s important to note that not all blockchains use these types of nodes. Mainly, they are popular in blockchains that have limited storage space per block, such as Bitcoin.\n\nHow Do Crypto Nodes Work?\n\nCrypto nodes on different blockchains can vary slightly, but let\u2019s look at a generic flow of how crypto nodes work and what they do.\n\nCrypto Nodes Distribute the Signed Transaction\n\nWhen you sign a transaction, the details are sent to a set of nodes. The first set of nodes passes it onto the other nodes, who then pass it on to the next level of nodes. They do this until the transaction is included in a block or discarded.\n\nNodes Then Verify Transactions in the Mempool\n\nAs the transaction is distributed, it enters a mempool in each node. Initially, it has a queued status. But from there, the nodes must validate the transaction. Once the majority of nodes validate that the transaction is valid, it moves to a pending status. This means that the transaction is ready to be added to the chain. Conversely, if the majority of nodes decide a transaction is not valid, it will be discarded.\n\nNodes Add Transactions To Blocks and Broadcast Them To The Network\n\nOnce the transaction moves to a pending status, miner or validator nodes are able to add the block to the network. At the point a miner or validator wins the block and adds it to the chain, the transaction becomes immutable. To explain, making any alteration to the transaction would require the majority of nodes\u2019 approval, which could be thousands of nodes in more popular blockchains. This simple mechanism keeps the chain secure.\n\nNodes Have Incentives (and Deterrents) To Ensure Good Behavior\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to note that some nodes are responsible for adding blocks to the network, which will usually earn them cryptocurrency rewards.\n\nOn a proof-of-work blockchain like Bitcoin, this requires a large amount of computational power in order to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle. This means that miners have an incentive to add valid blocks to the chain, but they also have a deterrent from behaving dishonorably\u2014simply the energy cost of mining wouldn\u2019t be profitable without the block rewards.\n\nOn a proof-of-stake blockchain, participating nodes also receive block rewards, but as a deterrent for bad behavior, these chains have a different method. To explain, validators must lock up a significant amount of their funds as collateral. Then if they behave honorably, they receive more rewards. If they behave maliciously, their collateral\u2014also called a stake\u2014is slashed. This mechanism ensures that nodes behave as they should, even without an ongoing energy cost and expensive equipment.\n\nCrypto Nodes: Why Are They So Important?\n\nCrypto nodes are integral to the security of blockchain systems. When trying to execute tasks in a decentralized manner, the only option is a peer-to-peer system, and the only way to manage one effectively is via a blockchain network. Nodes allow blockchains to validate transactions in a fair way\u2014and without a centralized entity taking a cut.\n\nPlus, the more participants there are operating nodes, the harder it is for bad actors to collude or take control of the network. They ensure that the users and miners are playing by the rules, with both features making the network more decentralized and secure.\n\nIn short, no matter what you\u2019re doing on a network, you\u2019re going to encounter nodes. In fact, you may even want to start operating a crypto node yourself! Whether you fancy running a full node, or even becoming a miner or validator node, there\u2019s an option for you. You can even fund a validator node directly through Ledger Live.\n\nNodes are the basis of blockchain systems; without them, there would be no blockchain storage in the first place. Together, nodes provide the whole infrastructure for a blockchain network\u2014which is why understanding them is so important.\n\nKnowledge is Power\n\nTrust yourself and keep on learning.

        "content": "A federal judge on Monday heard from multiple women who said they were victimized by a New Hampshire man's unlicensed bitcoin exchange business but postponed a sentencing hearing in the case to evaluate whether restitution is appropriate.\n\nProsecutors said Ian Freeman, a libertarian activist and radio show host, created a business that catered to fraudsters who targeted elderly women with romance scams, serving as \"the final step in permanently separating the victims from their money.\"\n\nAfter a two-week trial, he was convicted of eight charges in December, though his conviction on a money laundering charge was later overturned. He was scheduled to be sentenced on the remaining charges, which include operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit money laundering, on Monday but the hearing was delayed until next month.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Joseph LaPlante said the delay was necessary to give Freeman's attorneys a chance to object to the prosecution's push to make restitution part of the sentence. Prosecutors also argue he should get a harsher sentence because victims, many of them elderly, were particularly vulnerable.\n\nGet Boston local news, weather forecasts, lifestyle and entertainment stories to your inbox.

        "content": "Yet another legacy firm from Wall Street is entering the fray for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund, following early applications from BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\nFranklin Templeton, a financial heavyweight that dates its founding back to the mid\u201320th century, submitted an application for what it calls the \u201cFranklin Bitcoin ETF\u201d on Tuesday morning, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\n\nFranklin Templeton\u2019s application says it would list the Bitcoin ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange, and like BlackRock, lists Coinbase as its Bitcoin custodian.\n\nIn the filing, Franklin Templeton writes that the firm would use the CF Benchmarks Index, a fusion of Bitcoin prices from a slew of separate crypto exchanges, to inform its prices and prevent potential price manipulation.\n\nA spokesperson for the asset management firm declined to comment on the filing.\n\nFranklin Templeton\u2019s application comes after a unanimous federal appeals court last month found that the SEC had wrongly denied a bid by crypto firm Grayscale to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF. In its much-anticipated decision, the court said the denial was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the agency\u2019s prior approvals of ETFs for Bitcoin futures.\n\nThe push to obtain a spot Bitcoin ETF has been described as a \u201choly grail\u201d for the crypto industry as approval is expected to attract potentially trillions of dollars in investment from conservative institutional investors like pension funds.\n\nFor years, firms like Grayscale have tried and failed to persuade the SEC to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF, even though the agency approved a number of Bitcoin futures trading products. The SEC repeatedly cited potential market manipulation as one of the key factors for why it repeatedly denied companies\u2019 ETF applications.\n\nTo allay the federal agency\u2019s concerns, BlackRock said it would partner with Nasdaq as a \u201csurveillance partner\u201d to monitor the Bitcoin markets and detect potential manipulation. After BlackRock\u2019s filing, ARK Invest, Fidelity, and others inserted similar agreements into their ETF applications. Franklin Templeton\u2019s filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF included no mention of a surveillance partner.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price soared above $31,000 in response to the ETF filings from BlackRock and Fidelity, but has since slumped, never regaining the same momentum that had propelled the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency to its highest price in more than a year.\n\nUpdate, Sept. 12, 2023: Further details on Franklin Templeton\u2019s lack of a surveillance partner in its initial ETF application were included."

        "content": "Executives from prominent mining and manufacturing firms believe market forces resulting from the fourth Bitcoin halving scheduled in 2024 could force the price of Bitcoin (BTC) past $100,000.\n\nMagazine editor Andrew Fenton spoke to Canaan vice president Davis Hui following a panel discussion at Canaan\u2019s Avalon Bitcoin and Crypto Day (ABCD) in Singapore.\n\nHui and a panel that included Bitcoin mining ecosystem executives from Singapore, Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates all offered BTC price predictions around $100,000 in 2024 resulting from the effects of the latest Bitcoin mining reward halving.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin all-time high in 2025? BTC price idea reveals \u2018bull run launch\u2019\n\nHui told Cointelegraph that the supply of Bitcoin would be drastically reduced with the reward halving down to 6.25 BTC per block, while traditional finance institutions are showing increased interest in investing in the sector:\n\n\u201cWhat about BlackRock? They\u2019re holding onto $10 trillion of assets under management. The overall cryptocurrency market cap is $2 trillion \u2014 they have five times more than that.\u201d\n\nThe Canaan VP said his prediction was heavily influenced by the outcome of a number of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications lodged with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission by some of the world\u2019s largest asset managers.\n\n\u201cThis money will come in, the BTC demand will increase, while the supply has decreased, and the price will increase.\u201d\n\nHui also noted that it had become difficult for most miners to continue operating in highly competitive market conditions, with all-time hash rates and network difficulties directly eating into miner profitability.\n\nThose who could not cover electricity costs with the Bitcoin mining rewards earned will simply shut off those machines, while those who continue operating will do so with a view of the potential upside ahead of the 2024 halving, he said.\n\nMiners who can upgrade to more efficient and powerful machines are able to maintain better profitability, he said. Hui predicts that mining companies in the U.S. might be particularly hard pressed, given high electricity and administrative costs.\n\nHui also conceded that Canaan was among the industry companies to have reported a financial loss in the first quarter of 2023, highlighting the impact of a prolonged cryptocurrency bear market.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions: Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "title": "Bitcoin derivatives data suggests BTC price holds the current range - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin experienced a 5% increase after testing the $25,000 support level on Sept. 11. However, this breakout rally doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate a victory for bulls. To put today\u2019s price action in perspective, Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a 15% decline since July. In contrast, the S&P 500 index and gold have maintained relatively stable positions during this period.\n\nThis underperformance demonstrates that Bitcoin has struggled to gain momentum, despite significant catalysts such as MicroStrategy's plan to acquire an additional $750 million worth of BTC and the multiple requests for Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from trillion-dollar asset management firms. Still, according to Bitcoin derivatives, bulls are confident that $25,000 marked a bottom and opened room for further price gains.\n\nBitcoin/USD vs. gold and S&P 500 futures, 12-hour time frame. Source: TradingView\n\nSome argue that Bitcoin\u2019s primary drivers for 2024 are still in play, specifically the prospects of a spot ETF and the reduction in new supply following the April 2024 halving. Additionally, some of the cryptocurrency markets\u2019 immediate risks have diminished following the United States Securities and Exchange Commission experiencing partial losses in three separate cases, involving Grayscale, Ripple and the decentralized exchange Uniswap.\n\nOn the other hand, bears have their own set of advantages, including the ongoing legal cases against leading exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Moreover, there is the troubled financial situation of Digital Currency Group after one of its subsidiaries declared bankruptcy in January 2023. The group is burdened with debts exceeding $3.5 billion, potentially leading to the sale of funds managed by Grayscale, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.\n\nA look at derivatives metrics will better explain how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nBitcoin futures and options metrics held steady despite the correction\n\nBitcoin monthly futures typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement. As a result, BTC futures contracts should typically trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 1-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the demand for leveraged BTC long and short positions through futures contracts did not have a significant impact on the drop below the $25,000 mark on Sept. 11. However, the BTC futures premium continues to hover below the 5% neutral threshold. This metric remains in the neutral-to-bearish range, indicating a lack of demand for leveraged long positions.\n\nTo gauge market sentiment further, it\u2019s helpful to look at the options markets, as the 25% delta skew can assess whether the retest of the $25,000 level has made investors more optimistic. In short, if traders expect a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price, the skew metric will rise above 7%, while periods of excitement typically have a -7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe situation underwent a notable shift on Sept. 11, as the 25% delta skew metric \u2014 which previously indicated a 9% premium on protective put options, suggesting investors were expecting a correction \u2014 has now leveled off at zero. This indicates balanced pricing between call and put options, implying equal odds for both bullish and bearish price movements.\n\nMacroeconomic uncertainty favors bears, but BTC bulls remain confident\n\nGiven the uncertainty on the macroeconomic front, particularly with the upcoming release of the Consumer Price Index report on Sept. 13 and retail sales data on Sept. 14, it\u2019s likely that crypto traders will be cautious and prefer a \u201creturn to the mean.\" In this context, the mean represents the predominant trading range of $25,500 to $26,200 observed over the past couple of weeks.\n\nHowever, from a bullish perspective, the fact that derivatives markets held up during the dip below $25,000 is a promising sign. In other words, if bears had significant conviction, one would expect a stronger appetite for put options and a negative BTC futures premium, known as \u201cbackwardation.\"\n\nUltimately, both bulls and bears have significant triggers that could influence the price of Bitcoin, but predicting the timing of events such as court decisions and ETF rulings is challenging. This dual uncertainty likely explains why derivatives metrics have remained resilient, as both sides exercise caution to avoid excessive exposure.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Which Bitcoin Mining Stock Is a Better Buy: Riot or Marathon? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Competition in the Bitcoin mining sector is intense, with Riot Platforms (RIOT -6.05%) and Marathon Digital (MARA -8.61%) emerging as the top contenders. While both are currently positioned at the forefront, there are numerous industry-specific factors that can help investors understand why one company is the actual Bitcoin (BTC -1.26%) mining leader.\n\nMeasuring production\n\nWhile Marathon finished sixth in total Bitcoin mining production last year, 2023 is a different story. Currently ranked second, Marathon has mined just over 6,300 Bitcoins this year and led all miners with nearly 1,200 Bitcoins mined in July alone.\n\nThe jump in production can primarily be attributed to the company's strategy to get more miners online. Since the beginning of the year, Marathon's installed hash rate (a metric that quantifies a company's operational computing power) has more than doubled from just 11 exahashes per second (EH/s, a measure of computing power applied to mining cryptocurrencies) in January to 23 EH/s in August. This record-level production has bolstered Marathon's cache of 11,400 Bitcoins at the beginning of the year to more than 13,000 today, collectively worth $335.5 million at today's prices.\n\nWhile Marathon's production has skyrocketed in 2023, Riot's operations have been more consistent over the years. Today, Riot sits in third place in total Bitcoin production for 2023 and finished 2022 ranked second. Riot's hash rate today is just shy of 11 EH/s, good enough to produce more than 4,300 Bitcoins in 2023 and add to its total reserves of almost 7,300 Bitcoins valued at around $188 million.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nWhen comparing Marathon and Riot in terms of production and total Bitcoin reserves, Marathon clearly shines. However, like in any industry, increased revenue is insignificant if margins are narrowing.\n\nThis is where Riot excels. The company has some of the lowest operational expenses of all Bitcoin miners, with an average cost per Bitcoin mined of just $8,400. Conversely, Marathon has the fifth-highest costs at just under $19,000 per Bitcoin mined. These elevated costs are impacting Marathon's gross margin, which is a measly 32.5% today and falling from 42% last year. Even though Riot's production has not increased as fast as Marathon's, Riot's balance and efficiency of the total mining process are padding profits, with gross margin currently at 70% and growing from 60% last year.\n\nThere are likely two reasons for Riot's remarkable efficiency and subsequent healthier margins. First would be Riot's strategic location in Texas. Due to the Lone Star State's unregulated electricity market, which allows consumers to sell unused energy to the grid, Riot can earn power curtailment credits to offset costs. This is especially helpful when energy costs are greater than the profits Riot would secure from mining, a scenario that occurs when the grid is under high demand or Bitcoin's price slips. When this happens, Riot can divert the energy back to the grid and still earn a profit. While Marathon has some facilities in Texas, all of Riot's operations are in the state.\n\nFurther benefiting Riot's wide margins is its lack of long-term debt. Oftentimes, miners will take on debt to finance their operations and expand capabilities; this is the path that Marathon chose to take. Subsequently, Marathon has some of the highest debt in the industry.\n\nAstonishingly, Riot has zero long-term debt. The company's ability to rise to the top of the Bitcoin mining industry with virtually no debt is a testament to its resiliency and strategic vision. In fact, Riot's new Corsicana facility, which is currently under construction and will add up to 8 EH/s to its hash rate, is already fully funded without tapping into external financing.\n\nThe final verdict\n\nAt first glance, Marathon's record increases in production in 2023 would likely catch the attention of most investors. But with some digging and further evaluation, it becomes evident that Riot's robust financial health and industry-leading efficiency put it head and shoulders above the competition.\n\nIn an industry where profits correlate to Bitcoin's volatile price, investors must prioritize companies built for the long haul and with proven resiliency. From this perspective, the choice between Marathon and Riot becomes abundantly clear."

        "content": "New inflation data is out. The consumer price index was up 3.7% in August on a year over year basis. That's 0.1% higher than expected. So, what does that mean? Interest rates are going to stay higher for longer? Well, let's, and what does it mean for crypto? More importantly, that's, that's why you're here. Right? Well, joining us now with some answers to that and the entire meaning of life, all of life answers. Nonetheless, it's the crypto trader. He's the author of that book, Glenn Goodman. Welcome back. Welcome back, Glenn. It's great to be here and I've brought the meaning of life with me. It's, it's just here in my pocket. So uh I'll get to that shortly, but I had, I had the meaning of uh of life in my, in my jacket pocket as well. And then uh went to dry cleaners and it's gone. So, yeah, that happens all the time to me. Uh So, all right, we have the, the CP I data uh a little bit higher than expected, it was a little bit higher than expected. Um But, but the interesting thing when I look at the markets right now is that they've been going basically initially when the data came out because naught 0.6% month on month uh for inflation was, I mean, that was actually expected, but the year on year figure ended up being slightly higher than expected. And so uh the market, the stock market fell quite, you know, quite quickly initially. But then everybody looked, you know, after the initial snap, everyone looked at the actual data where, oh, actually it's not that bad. Is it? Is it? So then prices rushed back up again. Those, that, those probably the robots doing all that, right? So it's probably no human intervention at this point. It's like that's what happens when you set your algorithms too. Precisely. Yes, and not using any kind of thought involved. So, I, I mean, this question of hire for longer, uh or at least, you know, where we are and that it will last well into 2024. Uh It, it seemed like a lot of people were hoping and praying that there would be some sort of rate cut at the end of the year. Doesn't look like that's gonna happen. I don't think, uh, we're already in September, you know, December, I last, I checked that's four months away. I, I, you know, I'm using a calendar. Um, it doesn't seem like the, the fed will, will get around to cutting. Um So does that mean that the, the risk appetite and the willingness to get into crypto will remain sort of the things stand right now. Yeah. I mean, you know, every new piece of data that comes in, particularly from, for the American economy, obviously, you know, there's always the potential for things to change as things stand. I, I think it's highly unlikely that we'll get a rate cut before the end of the year. Um, I think in the next meeting, the fed will not do anything. And November is a question mark and you know, as we can see inflation, all right, it's, it's come down a fair amount, but it's, it's not going anywhere fast at the moment. And actually, if you look at core inflation, so, you know, the the the headline inflation figure obviously was pushed up uh quite heavily by the price of gas or petrol as we call it here in the UK. So, so, you know, that went up pretty heavily and that was the main thing that was bearing down on the figure. But the core inflation figure, which obviously professionals look at um pretty closely which excludes food and it excludes energy because they're considered volatile components. Uh what you actually end up with is a figure that was a little bit worrying. And I mean, basically what, what you had was core inflation 0.3% month on month, slightly faster than expected. Uh worked out at 3.4% annualized drug prices were quite a significant factor here, actually higher drug prices. Uh Also what else? Uh, rent is still running very hot. But, um, the, the auto market continues to do quite badly and that, that helped to sort of pull prices down again. So a bit of a mixed picture, but all in all, still slightly worrying, I'd be, I'd be very surprised if we saw, um, a rate cut before the end of this year. But as I say, every new piece of data can change my outlook as well as everybody else's. Would you be surprised? No. Ok. So you're leading more, more likely a rate hike than a rate cut uh Before the end of the year, I think that the Federal Reserve are still very determined to make sure that inflation gets dead and buried. They don't want to see it come back in a big way because uh for Jerome Powell, that would be very embarrassing. And there's nothing worse for somebody, for anybody for going to dinner parties to see their friends and their friends going. You really messed up your life, didn't you? You, you, you're embarrassed to say, you know, I know from experience. That is correct. So, yeah, I mean, I think from a psychological perspective, he's, he's gonna be inclined to stay higher for longer. Glenn. Let's, let's turn to Bitcoin now and take a look at this chart that you created, that illustrated your analysis of Bitcoin's price price. We have um, April there and now September, of course, we are in September, talk to us about what we're seeing. Right. Well, what I did there, I mean, this is basically just taken from my own Twitter feed in April. I tweeted out for the first time that those particular support and resistance lines after that top line, as you can see, there have been hit by the price and then started bouncing back down. So I was like, OK, that matches up with that earlier um resistance that we saw back in the uh when was it, it was back in the previous year. So um I sort of define those resistance and support lines right there. And then as as you can see here, we are in September and the same resistance and support lines still hold, the price has just been pogo between the two of them ever since for, you know, getting on for six months now. And II I included this not to go. Oh, look at how clever I am that I, that I saw this coming in April. It wasn't that I saw it coming. Exactly. It was just that it's that I wanted to emphasize the power of technical analysis or simple technical analysis. Forget all your complicated indicators when push comes to shove what's important is to look at where the main resistance and support are. And then you can really define um where a bull market would take off for me. That would be if the price pushed up hard above that resistance line and a bear market arguably would begin if we pushed way down below that support line in between those two lines. It's short term trader territory. As you can see, they push the price up whenever it hits support, they push the price down whenever it hits resistance. It's their little game in between those two lines, longer term investors. Um really only need to take things seriously when they go outside those two lines whenever that may be. Well, does your, does your arm hurt from patting yourself on the back? I was gonna say, I thought for sure there's a little bit of a humble brag in there. No, no, no, I didn't invent technical analysis, did I, I didn't invent support lines. I'm just, I'm just following the way that, you know, the, the the greats of 100 years ago laid it down and uh I say great, I mean, you know, they were just looking at what everybody else was looking at too. They just put a name on it. Support resistance. But from time immemorial, certainly sent, people have been looking at exactly these kinds of levels. I'm just a, a humble trader in a long line of traders. All right, Glenn, I think that's the perfect note to wrap the segment up on. Thanks. Thank you for joining us and taking a look at the markets this morning. See you soon. That was the crypto trader author Glenn Goodman."

The return to a negative correlation represents concerns about looming FTX liquidations, according to observers.\n\nThe 60-day trailing correlation between bitcoin's price and implied volatility flipped negative a week ago and fell to -0.29 early Tuesday, according to Velo Data.\n\nBitcoin's price has declined by almost 10% in four weeks. The price hit a three-month low below $25,000 on Monday as traders took account of the possibility that defunct crypto exchange FTX will secure bankruptcy court approval to start selling its $3.4 billion worth of crypto holdings. Leading crypto options exchange Deribit's BTC DVOL index, which measures the 30-day implied volatility, has increased to 42 from 32 in the past four weeks.\n\nA decrease in price alongside an increase in implied volatility indicates bias for put options, derivative contracts offering protection against price slides. Implied volatility refers to investors' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period and is influenced by demand for both call and put options. That means the negative correlation stems from expectations of and positioning for a potential FTX-induced aversion to risk.\n\n\"The market has spent the last few months preparing for a potential ETF approval and has thus been very concerned about asymmetric moves to the topside.\" Jeff Anderson, a senior trader at STS Digital, told CoinDesk. \"That sentiment has shifted recently with the FTX liquidation news and fears that the bottom could fall out of the spot price. As such, the implied volatility has gone bid with spot prices moving in an area of perceived weakness.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGriffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said concerns of additional monetary tightening in global markets are also behind the shift in the volatility trend.\n\n\"The impending U.S. August CPI data will likely show a rebound in inflation, which means the Federal Reserve (Fed) will probably take additional liquidity-tightening measures to curb reflation. In liquidity redistribution, crypto assets are prioritized last, which means that the liquidity stored in crypto assets could be withdrawn and invested in assets such as cash or U.S. stocks,\" Ardern said.\n\n\"That has pushed up investors' preference for puts, bringing a negative correlation between prices and volatility,\" Ardern added.\n\nAccording to RBC Economics, the CPI report due Wednesday is expected to show the cost of living in the U.S. ticked higher to 3.6% year-over-year in August, up from 3.2% in July. Several leading indicators have warned of an inflation rebound in the coming months. That's likely to keep the Fed from cutting interest rates and injecting liquidity into the market anytime soon.\n\nThe correlation has recently flipped negative, reflecting investor fears about potential price slide. (Velo Data)\n\nThe year has been characterized by consistent positive market value-volatility correlation, barring the latest negative flip and the one seen in May.\n\nThe positive correlation meant price rallies rewarded BTC call option holders with directional gains as well as volatility gains. With the return of negative correlation, put holders stand to make outsized money during potential price drops relative to what calls would earn during price rallies. That's usually the case in the equity markets."

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether continue to slide; altcoins under pressure - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin rose slightly on Tuesday afternoon in Asia but remained below the support level of US$26,000. Ether traded below US$1,600, with XRP leading losses across most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos, as news of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX possibly selling its US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets by the end of the year weighed on crypto markets. Investors are also looking forward to August inflation data from the U.S. due for release on Wednesday.\n\nSee related article: Standard Chartered\u2019s crypto custody arm Zodia launches in Singapore\n\nNegative sentiment across crypto market\n\nBitcoin gained marginally by 0.05% to US$25,819 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly gains to 0.40%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency remained below the support level of US$26,000 as negative market sentiment lingered.\n\n\u201cThe declines in cryptocurrencies came as negative sentiment continued to flow into the markets, in light of the state of anticipation of what might happen on the regulatory side of this market in the United States,\u201d said Samer Hasn, market analyst at multi-asset brokerage firm XS.com.\n\nThe U.S. will release August inflation data on Wednesday. \u201cThe expectations are for a slight increase in year-on-year inflation, to 3.4% from 3.2% of July. However, the market does not expect any further increase in interest rates, pricing a 93% probability of no change in interest rates at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and also not predicting any further rate hike before the end of 2023,\u201d said Matteo Greco, research analyst at the publicly listed digital asset and fintech investment firm Fineqia International.\n\n\u201cThe end of rate hikes, especially if combined with approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF [exchange traded fund], could represent a major driver to bring new capital into the market and improve liquidity,\u201d Greco said in an emailed statement on Monday.\n\nEther, the world\u2019s second biggest cryptocurrency, fell 1.97% to US$1,579 in the past 24 hours, and dropped 2.71% on the week.\n\n\u201cThe break of US$1,650 makes us extremely cautious about Ether, and we could even envision a scenario where prices drop lower into year-end,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed report.\n\n\u201cA decline below US$1,500 could bring back the idea that Ether could decline to US$1,000 \u2014 a level that would appear justified based on the revenue projection from the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nCrypto market is also under pressure as FTX crypto exchange, which went into bankruptcy in November 2022, is likely to receive court approval on Wednesday to liquidate an estimated crypto holding of US$3.4 billion. The firm proposed to sell up to US$100 million in crypto assets per week, which could be extended to US$200 million.\n\nAccording to Thielen, although sales might have a cap of US$200 million per week, it still implies that FTX creditors could sell every week.\n\n\u201cIt also indicates that crypto will see another US$3.4 billion in crypto-to-fiat off-ramping \u2014 a potential liquidity gap that might be hard to fill in the absence of Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Silvergate Bank, which were responsible for at least, 50% of all the fiat-to-crypto on-ramping during the last few years,\u201d Thielen pointed out.\n\nAltcoins could be particularly impacted \u201cdue to unfavorable tokenomics that compel early investors in projects to make prudent financial and survival decisions, and liquidate positions,\u201d he added.\n\nFTX is not the only major player selling assets. Crypto venture capital (VC) funds are also under immense pressure to return funds to their investors.\n\n\u201cWhile some crypto VC funds made 10-20x returns, several have had substantial drawdowns, leading investors to prefer cashing out \u2014 even if returns were materially higher. For example, Multicoin Capital lost 91% of its value in 2022,\u201d Thielen said.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization fell 0.62% to US$1.03 trillion while market volume rose 82.81% to US$37.73 billion in the past 24 hours.\n\nEthereum NFT sales volume rise\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.34% to 2,092.68 in 24 hours to 5.45 p.m. in Hong Kong, and dropped 3.43% over the past seven days. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon indexes also declined.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume rose 25.25% to US$10.81 million, while transactions gained 5.23% to 236,393, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nAmong blockchains, Ethereum topped the rankings by sales volume, which rose 42.69% to US$5.89 million in the past 24 hours. This was followed by the Mythos network, which rose 11.65% to US$1.15 million.\n\nThe Polygon blockchain, ranked third, dropping 9.26% to US$824,236.\n\nAccording to Hasn of XS.com, Binance\u2019s intention to delist Polygon network from its NFT marketplace pushed the price of the network\u2019s token (MATIC) to its lowest level this year.\n\n\u201cThe delisting of Polygon from Binance NFT Marketplace adds to the series of negative news swirling in this already turbulent market, in which traders are still living in a state of anticipation about what the regulatory and legal environment might be like,\u201d Hasn said.\n\nAmong collections, Mythos-based DMarket topped rankings with its sales volume rising 11.14% to US$1.14 million in the past 24 hours.\n\nGlobal markets fall ahead of crucial U.S. inflation data, ECB policy meeting\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAsian stock markets were mostly down on Tuesday in anticipation of the latest U.S. inflation data due for release on Wednesday. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component Index, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index dropped at the end of trading hours. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 gained.\n\nA Sept. 4-11 Reuters poll of 76 analysts, based in and outside mainland China, predicted China\u2019s economy would grow 5% this year, lower than 5.5% forecast in a July survey. In 2024, the poll forecasts a 4.5% gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the world\u2019s second-largest economy, and 4.3% in 2025.\n\n\u201cThe primary culprit is the property sector. This source of growth has now evaporated and won\u2019t be coming back,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics in Singapore, according to the Reuters report.\n\nIndia\u2019s benchmark index Sensex rose 0.14% at the close of trading hours on Tuesday.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund chief economist Gita Gopinath told India Today that India will be the world\u2019s third-largest economy in four years. Gopinath also said the world\u2019s most populous nation will contribute 15% of global growth this year.\n\nU.S. stock futures weakened as of 7 p.m. in Hong Kong on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 Futures were all in the red.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI), a key inflation indicator, for August will be released on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland expects the inflation gauge to rise 3.8% year-on-year, up from 3.2% in July.\n\nThe latest inflation report will provide further insights into the U.S. central bank\u2019s future monetary policies, which aims to bring the annual inflation rate below 2%. The Federal Reserve in July raised interest rates in the world\u2019s largest economy to between 5.25% and 5.5%, the highest in the past 22 years.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the U.S. central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in September.\n\nEuropean bourses \u2013 the benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 \u2013 fell in afternoon trade on Tuesday. Investors are looking forward to the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) policy meeting on Thursday, which is expected to indicate whether the central bank will increase interest rates further.\n\n\u201cThe European Central Bank would risk plunging the European Union into a long recession if it decides to raise interest rates at its pivotal meeting on Thursday, following the growth downgrades of the bloc by the European Commission,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of financial management group deVere, in an email statement.\n\n\u201cThe 0.4% contraction in Germany\u2019s economy, coupled with the European Commission\u2019s downward revision of growth expectations, suggests that the trajectory might be less stable than anticipated,\u201d Green pointed out.\n\n\u201cDespite the risks of steering the wider EU into a recession with another rate rise, we expect that the ECB will argue it is still too soon to pause in its battle against inflation and, therefore, will go for one final hike on Thursday.\u201d\n\n(updates with equities section)"

        "content": "A debate has reignited among Bitcoiners over a six-year-old Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to add \u201csidechains\u201d on top of the network, with some warning it could increase scams on the Bitcoin network and others saying it will bring new users of the cryptocurrency.\n\nMeanwhile, one developer claims to have found a way to achieve the proposal\u2019s goal without a soft fork of the blockchain.\n\nThe proposal in question, BIP-300 \u2014 also known as Bitcoin (BTC) Drivechains \u2014 was first introduced in 2017, which proposed introducing \u201csidechains\u201d that are separate blockchains on top of the Bitcoin network.\n\nPaul Sztorc, the proposal\u2019s author and founder of the Drivechain development firm LayerTwo Labs \u2014 which raised $3 million in December \u2014 has explained that the blockchains would allow for BTC to move onto them and create altcoins.\n\nThis is how Bip300 can eliminate all crypto and fiat transactions, leaving only Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/1TwQsu9ZPj \u2014 LayerTwo Labs (@LayerTwoLabs) July 10, 2023\n\nThe debate over the proposal was kicked up again on Aug. 22, when a Bitcoin core developer known as Luke Dashjr rewrote the proposal\u2019s code and requested to add it to Bitcoin\u2019s codebase.\n\nBIP-300 would require a soft fork of Bitcoin that would be activated by miners \u2014 not unlike the Taproot soft fork in November 2021 that paved the way for the equally controversial nonfungible tokenemulating Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens that launched earlier this year.\n\nOn Sept. 10, Maxim Orlovsky, the CEO of blockchain scaling solutions project Pandora, posted on X (Twitter) claiming he was able to create a two-way peg on Bitcoin without a soft fork of the blockchain, which BIP-300 requires.\n\nJust understood that one can do cryptoeconomically-safe trustless 2WP on #Bitcoin without any softfork today - using Prometheus - our 5-year old proposal for arbitrage of any high-load Turing-complete computing on top of Bitcoin: https://t.co/NljYszgkk7 pic.twitter.com/wV5MDuqUov \u2014 Maxim Orlovsky (@dr_orlovsky) September 10, 2023\n\nIn an accompanying note, Orlovsky explained an old project proposal could work as a BIP-300 alternative with an oracle working to validate a sidechain and \u201cthe protocol will reach consensus on whether the state reported by the oracle is correct.\u201d\n\nDetails, so far, are sparse. Orlovsky said he would work on a paper describing the setup \u201cin [an] understandable way.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, BIP-300 proponents, including Sztorc, argue that Drivechains will allow users to choose a blockchain security model they agree with and how they want their Bitcoin to work. Sztorc also claimed the proposal has \u201cenormous upside\u201d with \u201cliterally zero downside.\u201d\n\nRelated: No, Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges are not inherently bullish for crypto\n\nOthers, including Cory Klippsten, the chief of the BTC-only exchange Swan Bitcoin, rejected the proposal \u2014 with Klippsten claiming Drivechains would increase the amount of scams on Bitcoin, which may catch the ire of regulators.\n\nOne potential downside of Drivechains:\n\n\n\nHaving lots of scams on Bitcoin will make people and regulators (understandably) think that Bitcoin is full of scams. \u2014 Cory Klippsten | Swan.com #Bitcoin (@coryklippsten) August 27, 2023\n\nPierre Rochard, the vice president of research forBitcoin miner Riot Platforms, said the proposal\u2019s messaging relies on \u201cspeculative economic arguments rather than substantive engineering ones\u201d and added it was \u201cpure hopium.\u201d\n\nDrivechain\u2019s \u201cforce a softfork to kill sh*tcoins\u201d marketing somehow manages to be both anti-bitcoin and anti-\u201ccrypto\u201d. Also pure hopium. It\u2019s a distraction. Strong NACK. \u2014 Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) August 21, 2023\n\nOthers who lent their voice to support BIP-300 included educator Dan Held, who claimed that Bitcoin is better off with more speculative assets as they \u201cintroduce new audiences to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin wallet provider Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp said he\u2019s yet to see a \u201cconvincing concern\u201d of how sidechains could be dangerous to the main Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nI'm generally in favor of finally fulfilling the promise of 2-way pegged sidechains. I've yet to see a convincing concern of how it could be dangerous to the main chain. Some folks have said it could be dangerous if a sidechain became more valuable than the base chain, but seems\u2026 \u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) August 30, 2023\n\nHe added if a sidechain becomes more valuable, it could signal that the base chain \u201cshould implement that sidechain\u2019s features.\u201d\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Recursive inscriptions \u2014 Bitcoin \u2018supercomputer\u2019 and BTC DeFi coming soon"

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 September 13, 2023 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Coinbase COIN, MicroStrategy MSTR, BlackRock BLK, Marathon Digital MARA and ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITO.\n\nBitcoin's Untapped Potential: Institutional Adoption\n\nThe revolutionary invention of Bitcoin came from a humble 2008 white paper by a pseudonymous person or people named Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea was simple yet powerful \u2013 create a digital, decentralized, secure network resistant to a single point of failure. Through the years, Bitcoin has seen some major tests, including (but not limited to):\n\nThe 2008 Financial Crisis\n\nBitcoin went live slightly after the largest recession in more than 100 years.\n\nMt. Gox Collapse\n\nEarly in Bitcoin\u2019s existence, Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world and handled around 70% of Bitcoin transactions. However, in early 2014, Mt. Gox was hacked, and the exchange lost approximately 850,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers, equating to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFTX Bankruptcy\n\nFTX was one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, but in 2022, regulators discovered that its founder Sam Bankman Fried, allegedly mishandled customer funds. Soon after, Fried was arrested, and FTX was forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nBitcoin Resilience\n\nBitcoin is known for having ardent haters and religious followers. Nonetheless, despite the shockwaves these and other events sent through the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin itself has survived. Through thick and thin, Bitcoin has continued to function as a decentralized digital currency, and its price eventually recovered. Since its inception, Bitcoin\u2019s average annual return has been stunning \u2013 230% annually (well above the S&P 500 and pretty much every asset). Bitcoin is now worth $510 billion \u2013 well above most Fortune 500 companies.\n\nInstitutional Adoption: A Major Catalyst that Hasn\u2019t Come to Fruition (Yet)\n\nIf you missed the meteoric Bitcoin returns, is the juice still worth the squeeze? The answer is yes. Bitcoin has achieved stunning returns without major institutional investors being involved. Below are 3 catalysts that will send Bitcoin and Bitcoin proxies even higher:\n\nStory continues\n\nLegal Clarity\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is locked in major lawsuits against crypto players. Recently, XRP altcoin parent Ripple scored a historic court win over the SEC. The court ruled that XRP is not an offer of unregistered securities. That\u2019s potentially good news for Coinbase, the largest US crypto exchange that is currently entangled in a similar lawsuit with the SEC.\n\nNew Accounting Standards\n\nRecently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changed corporate accounting rules \u2013 a move that will help crypto-centric companies like MicroStrategy. MSTR, one of the largest Bitcoin holders, can now alleviate undesired perceptions associated with holding Bitcoin. Furthermore, the new standards will allow banks to take custody and lend against Bitcoin \u2013 a significant win for the industry.\n\nSpot ETF Approval\n\nCurrently, no spot Bitcoin ETF exists in the United States. As the name implies, a spot ETF is a mechanism to invest in Bitcoin \u201con the spot.\u201d The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF,a non-spot Bitcoin ETF, is underperforming Bitcoin itself dramatically year-to-date.\n\nHowever, BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, has applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF, along with others. With that in mind, the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF seems inevitable (out of more than 500 applications, BLK has only had one rejected in its history).\n\nSlowly, Then All at Once\n\nAfter years of failures, the Bitcoin and crypto industry is inching closer to regulatory clarity due to recent court victories, new accounting standards, and the potential for a spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Regulatory clarity will clear the way for institutional adoption. If institutional adoption is to take place, clear winners would be Bitcoin itself, Bitcoin proxies such as Marathon Digital and Coinbase, which will benefit from increased trading from institutions and custody of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether bounce back; altcoins recover after FTX panic - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Wednesday morning in Asia to near US$26,000, after sinking below the key support level of US$25,000 on Tuesday for the first time in three months. Ether also bounced back to near US$1,600 as all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged gains with Toncoin leading the winners with a 24-hour surge of over 12%. The rally followed the recent panic sell-off over an incoming liquidation from collapsed crypto exchange FTX, which is expected to unload its US$3.4 billion crypto holdings by the end of the year. U.S. stock futures traded flat after Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday amid oil price concerns.\n\nBitcoin nears US$26,000; Overreactions towards FTX liquidation plan?\n\nBitcoin rose 3.02% in the last 24 hours to US$25,867.44 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, adding 0.36% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency briefly touched an almost three-month-low of US$24,930.30 and bounced back to a high of US$26,451.94 on Tuesday.\n\nEther saw a similar rebound, rising 3.10% to US$1,595.00 but lost 2.28% in the past seven days. The second top crypto reached a 24-hour high of US$1,619.11 on Tuesday.\n\nThe current crypto market sentiment echoes \u201cthe late-stage bear market from 2015 and 2019,\u201d as \u201ca sustained period of poor momentum has pushed the fear and greed index to a nine-month low,\u201d crypto research firm K33 wrote in a report Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe worsening sentiment originates from anticipated sell-side pressure related to FTX balances of US$560 million BTC, US$192 million ETH, and US$1.16 billion SOL,\u201d wrote K33. \u201cThe market also expects further sellside pressure from Mt. Gox\u2019s trustees and U.S. Silk Road Bitcoins. The schedule and structure of these potential sell-side flows are unknown but have all been decisive forces in hammering an already pressured sentiment.\u201d\n\nFTX, which went into bankruptcy in November 2022, may receive court approval on Wednesday to sell its crypto holding that totals around US$3.4 billion. However, the recent sell-off ahead of the liquidation could be an overreaction, according to Greg Moritz, co-founder and chief operating officer of crypto hedge fund Alt Tab Capital.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cFTX, having an interest in acquiring the highest price for its assets, will likely go about the liquidation in an orderly and rational way that minimizes the effect on market pricing,\u201d said Moritiz in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cOverall, the actual impact of the potential FTX liquidation on the crypto market is likely to be quite small and take place over months, however, we already have downward pressure on many coins as a result of the proposal,\u201d Moritz added. \u201cThis is primarily due to the retail crypto market not fully understanding FTX\u2019s proposal and reacting based on fear rather than logic. When that happens, it tends to create attractive buying opportunities for savvy investors with a long-term focus.\u201d\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted gains in the past 24 hours. Toncoin led the winners, which rose 12.49% to US$1.84 and gained 3.73% for the week.\n\nToncoin is the native token of the Open Network (TON), a blockchain-based, decentralized network originally developed by messaging app Telegram, whose price has jumped over 30% in the past month. TON is set to have a presentation with Telegram at the ongoing Token2049 event in Singapore on Wednesday, with the theme: \u201cTransforming Telegram to Web3 with Toncoin.\u201d\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 2.54% in the past 24 hours to US$1.03 trillion, as trading volume rose 9.22% to US$35.33 billion.\n\nU.S. stock futures flat before CPI release\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading flat as of 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Both Dow futures and S&P 500 futures inched 0.01% lower, while Nasdaq futures edged up 0.05%. All three major U.S. indexes booked losses during trading hours on Tuesday, with Nasdaq leading with a 1.04% drop.\n\nThe main stock indexes in Asia were mixed as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng moved up, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 logged losses.\n\nThe U.S.-based computer technology firm Oracle Corp. spearheaded the Wall Street decline on Tuesday, whose stock price closed the day 13.50% lower. The company on Monday reported its first-quarter revenue of the fiscal year 2024 and projection for second-quarter earnings, which were both below the expectations as the demand for cloud computing slows down.\n\nFollowing Oracle, cloud-heavy technology firms Microsoft and Amazon also booked losses on Tuesday, falling 1.83% and 1.31% respectively.\n\nOn the inflation front, the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for August will be released on Wednesday, with analysts expecting an acceleration in annual inflation rate.\n\nAn annual growth in core CPI of over 4.5% can indicate a sticker-than-expected inflation, Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at investment advisor IG Australia Pty, told Bloomberg on Wednesday, which could make the S&P 500 \u201cboard the express train back to the August low 4,350/30 area.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, rising oil prices are adding to the inflation concerns, with the benchmark Brent Crude closing 1.6% higher at US$92.06 on Tuesday, the highest level since November 2022.\n\n\u201cPeople are a little bit worried about energy prices picking up pretty aggressively in recent weeks and that creates some concerns as we look forward to November\u201d, which could make the Federal Reserve raise interest rates again, Thomas Hayes, chairman at equity firm Great Hill Capital LLC., said, according to a Wednesday Reuters report.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, which is currently in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%. It gives a 56.8% chance for another pause in November, down from 57.6% on Tuesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "With Bitcoin mining difficulty at an all-time high, is it too late for beginners to start mining the largest cryptocurrency by market cap? The short answer is No \u2014 there are specialized services that make the whole mining process look easy.\n\nBitcoin mining is a tricky business. It requires expensive hardware equipment, cheap and stable electricity and a lot of maintenance to keep the facility in shape, like cooling systems and hardware updates.\n\nThese days, starting Bitcoin mining operations from scratch as an individual is not a good business plan. Many factors need to align perfectly, including geography, energy costs, regulation, weather and the Bitcoin (BTC) price itself. Still, the upfront costs are too high for regular people.\n\nBeginners can start mining by joining specialized mining pools. However, due diligence is needed because mining pools charge fees and split the rewards between participants. The problem with these pools is that they are centralized entities that may not always be transparent or expose participants to risks. For example, during the Crypto Winter of 2022, a mining pool operator halted Bitcoin withdrawals due to liquidity issues.\n\nBitcoin mining for beginners\n\nSome Bitcoin mining services eliminate the entry barriers for beginners. One example is GoMining, which offers various features that give Bitcoin miners more control and opportunities.\n\nBy joining GoMining, users don\u2019t have to buy and set up hardware or maintain the equipment. All processes are conducted online, while GoMining does all the behind-the-scenes work. The mining service has been around for over six years and currently has a power capacity of 350 megawatts across its nine data centers dispersed worldwide. This translates into a total hash rate of 2.1 million terahashes per second.\n\nFor more than two years, GoMining has been allowing individuals to access its mining data centers and paying out rewards, even during the crypto winter of 2022 and other bearish markets. Moreover, GoMining is a member of the Bitcoin Mining Council and has MMA legend Khabib Nurmagomedov as its ambassador.\n\nWith GoMining, users can access Bitcoin mining through a system of proprietary tokens, including:\n\nGOMINING token. This is the main utility token of the GoMining ecosystem. It enables holders to buy GoMining nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and lock them to get rewards paid in VeGoMining to participate in governance.\n\nThis is the main utility token of the GoMining ecosystem. It enables holders to buy GoMining nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and lock them to get rewards paid in to participate in governance. GoMining NFTs. The NFTs by GoMining represent ownership of the Bitcoin hash rate in its data centers, entitling holders to daily mining rewards.\n\nSource: GoMining\n\nNew tokenomics ensure transparency\n\nRecently, GoMining rebranded and introduced new tokenomics to simplify access to Bitcoin mining, while its native token changed its ticker from GMT to GOMINING to avoid confusion with other projects. The latest upgrade introduced the so-called liquid Bitcoin hash rate (LBH) protocol, which borrows from liquid staking platforms in decentralized finance (DeFi), such as Lido.\n\nGoMining LBH tokens, which come in the form of NFTs, enable users to transparently and securely own hash rate. Holders of these tokens have to pay for electricity while receiving mining revenues, so they end up in a better financial position than traditional miners. On top of that, these LBH tokens can be used in DeFi for borrowing and lending purposes or trading on secondary markets.\n\nSource: GoMining\n\nWith the new tokenomics model, LBH token holders can pay for electricity with GOMINING and benefit from a 10% discount. Also, the model uses a burn and mint mechanism, in which all tokens used to pay for the electricity expenses are burned algorithmically, while the system redistributes minted tokens for community rewards and to service providers, VeTokenomics stakers and the GoMining team.\n\nSource: GoMining\n\nThe new tokenomics brings more transparency while ensuring the NFTs are directly linked to the data centers.\n\nNew products, data centers and exchange listings on the horizon\n\nGoMining is expanding its network and plans to introduce new features and products to make the Bitcoin mining process more exciting. By the end of this year, it plans to add 50-megawatt data centers in the MENA region and increase the total hash rate to 3,000,000 terahashes per second. To top it all off, GoMining is also working on a Web3 game and planning to list on top exchanges.\n\nGoMining CEO Mark Zalan said:\n\n\u201cOur objectives encompass broadening the company\u2019s global network through the construction of additional data centers across the world. Simultaneously, we are delving into technologies such as DeFi and other advancements in the blockchain sphere.\u201d\n\nNot all mining software is designed with beginners in mind, but projects like GoMining with easy-to-use and quick-start mining features are changing that, allowing almost anyone to participate in Bitcoin mining without installing complex hardware.\n\nLearn more about GoMining"

        "content": "Swan denies customers\u2019 funds were lost in the Fortress hack.\n\nThe company has a range of security measures to prevent asset loss.\n\nRipple acquired Fortress and made whole customer losses.\n\nCryptocurrency hacks continue to plague the industry, undermining trust across the board. Blockchain security firm Peckshield underscored the scale of the problem by reporting that more than $3 billion was stolen by hackers in 2022.\n\nInfrastructure firm Fortress is the latest to fall prey to hackers, following the disclosure last week of a third-party API security breach in which an undisclosed amount was stolen. In the fallout, Swan Bitcoin, which uses Fortress for custody purposes, denied being affected by the hack.\n\nSwan Assures Customers\n\nSwan has addressed concerns that the Bitcoin stolen in the Fortress hack was siphoned from user holdings. A post from the company\u2019s X account stated that, during the hack, Swan customers\u2019 coins were safely held in cold storage with sub-custodian BitGo.\n\nThe tweet further sought to reassure customers that Swan utilizes various security procedures, including video calls, physical access, and on-chain visibility, to prevent asset loss.\n\nSwan client coins are in insured cold wallets at BitGo and did not move during the reported incident at Fortress. The coins are protected by video calls and physical access, and are not subject to any incidents at Fortress.\n\n\n\nSwan set up this agreement with Fortress to use BitGo\u2026 \u2014 Swan Bitcoin Adoption Team (@SwanBitcoin) September 11, 2023\n\nSwan managing director Steven Lubka explained that the \u201ctri-party\u201d model, involving Swan, Fortress, and BitGo, was implemented after the Prime Trust incident and required daily reconciliations between all parties and BitGo\u2019s approval to authorize transfers.\n\nPrime Trust filed for bankruptcy in August following a string of controversies that culminated in Nevada regulators placing the firm in receivership, which refers to a remedy for secured creditors to recover amounts owed. Prime Trust was Swan\u2019s custodian before Fortress\u2019 appointment, leading to Swan being heavily panned over the association, with this latest incident doing little to reassure Swan users that things have changed.\n\nMeanwhile, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe wasted no time joining Swan to distance his company from the fallout of the security breach.\n\nFortress Breached\n\nBelshe took Swan\u2019s lead, clarifying that BitGo was also unaffected by the hack. The BitGo CEO posted a lengthy tweet detailing his disappointment with Fortress on numerous counts, highlighting that the firm minced words to downplay the incident and suggest that customers had, in fact, not lost funds.\n\nBelshe further revealed that Fortress had contacted BitGo following the hack but ignored their advice to disclose the matter sooner. Fortress went public with the information on September 7, stating that it had suffered a security breach related to third-party API integrations at the end of August.\n\nAlthough it mentioned that four customers were affected by the incident, the company did not reveal the amount hackers stole. Fortress was subsequently acquired by Ripple, which paid to cover the resulting losses from the hack.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nSwan\u2019s Bitcoin maximalist principles clash with Ripple being the ultimate custodian of its customers\u2019 BTC.\n\nPrime Trust and Fortress were both founded by Scott Purcell, a fact Swan was doubtless aware of.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWhile Swan customers may have escaped unscathed, the Fortress hack has reignited doubts about Swan\u2019s partner selection process and due diligence procedures.\n\nDiscover the details behind the most expensive Bitcoin transaction fee ever recorded here:\n\nUser Pays $500,000 for a Single Bitcoin Transaction: Details\n\n\n\nUnderstand Brian Armstrong\u2019s take on the upcoming US presidential election here:\n\nCoinbase CEO: Crypto to Take Center Stage in 2024 US Election"

        "content": "The US-based asset management firm, Franklin Templeton entered the race to obtain approval for the first US exchange-traded fund (ETF) that directly invests in Bitcoin. Franklin Templeton filed an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today (Tuesday), joining the ranks of other asset managers like Fidelity and BlackRock.\n\nIf the SEC gives the green light, Franklin Templeton intends to rely on Coinbase Global as the custodian for the ETF\u2019s Bitcoin holdings, while Bank of New York Mellon will handle the cash component of the fund.\n\nGrowing Interest in ETFs Fuels Bitcoin\n\nThe rise in the price of Bitcoin throughout the year can be partially attributed to the growing optimism that the largest asset management firms, including BlackRock and now Franklin Templeton, are showing an interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs. This interest has sparked hopes that the SEC will be more inclined to approve such a fund despite previously rejecting such applications.\n\nThe supporters of spot Bitcoin ETFs argue that their introduction would open digital currencies to a broader base of investors, potentially driving the value of Bitcoin up. However, the SEC has raised concerns about the potential fraud and market manipulation in the past when rejecting similar applications.\n\nThe path toward spot Bitcoin ETF approval took a significant turn in August when Grayscale Investments secured a victory over the SEC, Finance Magnates reported. A federal appeals court overturned the SEC\u2019s rejection of Grayscale\u2019s application to transform its Bitcoin trust into a spot Bitcoin Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that Read this Term ETF. The court dismissed the objection by the SEC as arbitrary and capricious, citing a lack of clear explanation.\n\nFranklin Templeton has been making notable strides in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. In 2021, the company launched a money market fund that leverages blockchain technology to record share ownership. The Franklin Onchain US Government Money Fund is currently valued at USD $295 million.\n\nShift to Ethereum ETFs\n\nAbout a week ago, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) submitted two applications to the SEC, seeking approval for the creation of the VanEck Ethereum ETF and the ARK 21Shares Ethereum ETF.

        "content": "In the latest episode of The Market Report, Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman delves into Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) latest bounce at $25,000, which some analysts and influencers argue represents a short-term buying opportunity. Pechman explains that Bitcoin\u2019s inverse correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index has only held for 40% of the previous 20 months, meaning it is likely not a good metric to anticipate price movements.\n\nThe show then shifts focus to a recent Glassnode report revealing that the amount of BTC changing hands is at its lowest since October 2020, citing investors\u2019 \u201capathy\u201d and \u201cexhaustion.\u201d Pechman argues that bulls got tired after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s relentless action to pursue Coinbase and Binance. Ultimately, Pechman disagrees that Bitcoin\u2019s recent movement to $25,000 presents an opportunity for buyers, given that the short-term risk-reward ratio near the current price level is around 50:50.\n\nFor the show\u2019s next segment, Pechman analyzes the prediction made by Davis Hui, vice president of Bitcoin miner Canaan, that BTC will hit $100,000 in 2024 based on the halving and a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. First, Pechman explains that BlackRock\u2019s $10 trillion in assets is merely a mirage, as 55% is stuck in fixed-income investments and $2.8 trillion is already invested in other ETFs such as commodities, the S&P 500 index, global emerging markets and alternative investments.\n\nFurthermore, Pechman raises the risk of current holders deciding to flip their positions previously bought at $60,000, $50,000 or even $40,000 if Bitcoin\u2019s price were to shoot up, meaning the offer side is never predictable regardless of miners\u2019 incentives. Lastly, Pechman explains that a spot Bitcoin ETF has been a dream for the past eight years, and nothing has changed to refute the SEC\u2019s reasons for dismissal, namely stablecoin trading volumes and unregulated offshore exchanges.\n\nCheck out the latest episode of The Market Report, available exclusively on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Does Your Portfolio Need a Boost? How One Asset Could Be Exactly What Investors are Looking For. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's no secret that Bitcoin (BTC -1.40%) is one of the most volatile assets. For this reason and possibly others, most investors shy away from giving the world's most valuable cryptocurrency a spot in their portfolios.\n\nHowever, as time marches on and Bitcoin continues to prove its worth in an increasingly digital world, there's mounting evidence that owning even just a little Bitcoin might be one of the best ways for investors to boost their portfolios over the long term.\n\nWhat the numbers say\n\nIn an August study, crypto asset manager Bitwise Investments analyzed how varying degrees of Bitcoin allocation would affect a traditional 60/40 portfolio -- and the results were astounding. The composition of the research was fairly straightforward. In the hypothetical portfolio, 60% was invested in equities in the form of the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT -0.35%) and the remaining 40% was designated for bonds using the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND -0.49%).\n\nBitwise also chose to focus on Bitcoin's performance from January 2013 to June 2023 since Bitcoin's price ascension from 2010 to 2013 was more than 1,500,000%. This is unlikely to happen again and would likely skew results. Lastly, to capture how varying degrees of allocation affected portfolio performance, Bitwise analyzed Bitcoin based on it making up 1%, 2.5%, and 5% of a portfolio.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. Over the 10-year time frame that the study analyzed, the traditional 60/40 portfolio without any Bitcoin allocation returned a healthy 64%. But when adding just 1% of Bitcoin, performance jumped to 78%. At 2.5% of Bitcoin, the portfolio more than doubled to 101%, and bumping exposure to 5% resulted in an astounding 144% increase.\n\nStriking a balance\n\nThese results alone are intriguing and highlight the value Bitcoin presents for investors looking to adequately diversify while also increasing performance. But Bitwise took the analysis a step further. Adding to its evaluation of performance based on varying allocations, Bitwise also considered the impact rebalancing the portfolio over particular time frames would have.\n\nAfter applying rebalancing strategies on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis to each of the designated allocations, Bitwise found that the quarterly rebalancing produced the best returns while minimizing volatility.\n\nTo combine the results of allocation levels and rebalancing strategies, Bitwise discovered that the ideal amount of Bitcoin exposure would be at 5%, with a quarterly rebalancing. This strategy struck the perfect balance of maximizing performance while limiting volatility as overall risk significantly increased over the 5% level.\n\nThe Bitcoin effect\n\nIn an effort to capture the overall potential Bitcoin exposure provides to portfolios, regardless of the level of allocation, Bitwise compiled additional data from its analyses to highlight the misconceptions around Bitcoin's volatility and performance.\n\nAcross all scenarios of allocation and rebalancing, results proved that \"positive contribution from a bitcoin allocation does not come at the price of greater volatility.\" In fact, the study found that Bitcoin provided a boost to all portfolios' Sharpe ratios, which measures risk-adjusted return and performance.\n\nPerhaps the most important discovery from the analyses was Bitcoin's usefulness over longer time spans. Bitcoin would have contributed positively to a diversified portfolio's returns in 70% of one-year periods, 94% of two-year periods, and 100% of three-year periods since 2014, assuming quarterly rebalancing.\n\nThe multiple benefits Bitcoin produced, even at a 1% allocation, highlights its ability to favorably impact portfolios over the long term. Admittedly, higher levels of allocation for those with shorter time horizons and lower risk tolerances might not be recommended. For investors with a goal of holding for three years or longer, however, few other assets can provide positive benefits without introducing additional risk."

        "title": "Paxos confirms it's responsible for paying a $500K Bitcoin transaction fee - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The account that overpaid $500,000 in fees on Sept. 10 for a Bitcoin transfer belonged to Paxos, according to a Sept. 13 statement from the company. Paxos claimed that end users have not been affected and all user funds are safe. Paxos is most well-known as the issuer of stablecoins, including PayPal USD (PYUSD) and Pax Dollar (USDP), but also runs a crypto brokerage firm that carries Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe statement comes after users on X (formerly Twitter) were speculating that PayPal may have been responsible for the transaction due to a related wallet account that had been identified by analytics platform OXT as belonging to PayPal. A Paxos representative told Cointelegraph that PayPal was not responsible, as the error was its own, stating:\n\n\u201cPaxos overpaid the BTC network fee on Sept. 10, 2023. This only impacted Paxos corporate operations. Paxos clients and end users have not been affected and all customer funds are safe. This was due to a bug on a single transfer and it has been fixed. Paxos is in contact with the miner to recoup the funds.\u201d\n\nThe mistaken transaction was first discovered on Sept. 10, shortly after it had occurred. According to blockchain data, the sender paid fees of approximately 20 BTC (over $515,000 worth at the time) to send just 0.07 BTC (worth less than $2,000 at the time). At the time, Casa wallet co-founder Jameson Lopp declared that the sending account \u201clooks like an exchange or payment processor with buggy software,\u201d as it had made over 60,000 transactions from the same address.\n\nThe block that contained the transaction was confirmed by Bitcoin mining pool F2Pool. On Sept. 10, the pool\u2019s management offered to return the funds to whoever sent the transaction if a claim was made within three days. Otherwise, the exorbitant fee would be paid out to the pool\u2019s hashing power contributors.\n\nBefore Paxos made its statement, Bitcoin enthusiast Mononaut declared on X that PayPal was responsible for the transaction.\n\nBREAKING\n\nThe fat fingers belong to PayPal https://t.co/pKN0w5SfKB \u2014 mononaut (@mononautical) September 13, 2023\n\nAccording to Mononaut, the sending account, bc1qr35hws365juz5rtlsjtvmulu97957kqvr3zpw3, had exhibited behavior that \u201cclosely matches the behavior of a now inactive wallet [bc1qhs3gptkxem5y7yaq2yg0un2m8hae6wt87gkx4n].\u201d This inactive address was labeled \u201cPaypal\u201d by blockchain analytics platform OXT.\n\nTo add further evidence for their hypothesis, Mononaut pointed out that this old wallet address transferred its funds to the new address through an intermediate account. Bitcoin blockchain data shows that the old address labeled \u201cPaypal\u201d by OXT transferred approximately 18.5 BTC to address bc1qlm0xlahpysq2v9yh5rhcc430xjz3xknqqnyvaf on June 19. That account then sent \u200earound 5.37 BTC to the new address that later made the mistaken transaction. Lopp shared the thread, wondering aloud if PayPal would request the funds back.\n\nRelated: Coinbase to integrate Bitcoin Lightning Network: CEO Brian Armstrong\n\nPaxos later issued its statement confirming that the mistake had been its own, not PayPal\u2019s.\n\nPaxos isn\u2019t the first crypto user or company to potentially pay thousands of dollars in fees because of a mistake. In 2019, one Ethereum user lost over $300,000 when they mistakenly pasted values into the wrong fields. Luckily for them, the mining pool agreed to return 50% of the funds lost. In 2020, another Ethereum user mistakenly paid $9,500 for a $120 trade. The user claimed that the mistake had \u201cdestroyed [their] life.\u201d\n\nIn its statement, Paxos claimed that it had contacted the mining company that confirmed the transaction and is attempting to recover the lost funds."

That\u2019s a period of time when I see a singularity point where you see exponential growth, and that\u2019s also when we had growth in our company.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I would contribute my success or any sort of achievement or following number mainly to Bitget\u2019s growth,\u201d she adds.\n\nWhat type of Twitter content can you expect?\n\nChen\u2019s Twitter account offers serious variety. You\u2019ll get a glimpse into her jet-setting escapades, and who knows, you might even stumble upon some wild travel inspiration.\n\nBut when the crypto world goes haywire \u2014 whether it\u2019s lawsuits, exchanges going down or everything in between \u2014 Chen serves up honest breakdowns in bite-sized portions.\n\nWhat type of content do you like?\n\nChen has mixed feelings about Twitter, thinking it can sometimes become a raucous battleground.\n\n\u201cTwitter is basically a very noisy place. Everyone is changing their opinions and trying to be attention grabbers,\u201d Chen declares.\n\nYou open twitter and you see:\n\n\u2013 SEC suing this and that\n\n\u2013 rumors around projects\n\n\u2013 coins dropping in price\n\n\n\nFriendly reminder that Twitter isn't the real world.\n\n\n\nCrypto has made a ton of progress in 2023: \u2014 Gracy Chen @Bitget (@GracyBitget) June 12, 2023\n\nShe reveals that she enjoys seeing updates from Altcoin Daily and Coin Bureau, but she advises hardcore Crypto Twitter addicts to tear their eyes away from the screen every now and then.\n\n\u201cI would highly recommend anyone who is a heavy user of crypto information on Twitter to spend at least one hour or two away from social media and do fundamental research and talk to a group of trustworthy friends.\u201d\n\nPredictions\n\nChen firmly believes that Bitcoin exchange-traded funds are on the path to approval, though 2023 might not be the year it happens.\n\n\u201cNot this year \u2014 we only have three months left this year. Maybe early 2024,\u201d she predicts.\n\nShe hints that it could be a \u201cvery good driving force\u201d for the next bull market.\n\nA real Bitcoin ETF is coming soon.\n\n\n\nHere's how Grayscale's win against the SEC impacts you:\n\n/THREAD/ pic.twitter.com/wSxVzN5vdm \u2014 Gracy Chen @Bitget (@GracyBitget) September 1, 2023\n\nWhen it comes to Coinbase and Binance\u2019s showdown against the SEC, Chen suggests Coinbase might be in safe waters \u2014 but Binance could be in for a rollercoaster.\n\n\u201cI personally think that Coinbase is a pretty well-regulated, U.S.-driven crypto exchange, so the lawsuits might be settled by some fines.

        "content": "What a difference a day makes, at least as far as cryptocurrencies go. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) made a startling recovery in the last 24 hours and turned around a large portion of its losses from yesterday. With that, a wide range of cryptocurrency stocks followed suit and saw shares climb to varying degrees throughout the day.\n\nAmong the winners was Greenidge Generation (NASDAQ:GREE), which saw its shares jump over 6% at one point in Tuesday\u2019s trading. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), known for its supply of over 150,000 Bitcoin, and Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), currently looking into a Bitcoin ETF, also gained modestly in today\u2019s trading. Posting fractional gains in Tuesday afternoon\u2019s trading, meanwhile, were crypto mainstays Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) and crypto exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN).\n\nFranklin Resources\u2019 play is actually unusual for a couple of reasons. The biggest one, not surprisingly, is that this is the first time Franklin Resources has ever tried to set up such an operation. Secondly, it\u2019s one of the first to make the play after certain legal headaches at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were finally taken down. The more such moves are made, the better overall crypto is likely to do; getting institutional money into cryptocurrency could trigger a gold rush bigger than any seen to date.\n\nGreenidge may have had the biggest gains, but it also has one of the lightest presences among analysts. It\u2019s rated a consensus Hold, but no analyst as yet has a price target on the stock. Meanwhile, Microstrategy, a Strong Buy, offers investors 45.97% upside potential thanks to its $508.25 average price target.\n\nDisclosure"

        "title": "Build Asset Management Debuts Bitcoin-Backed Private Credit Fund in Partnership with Unchained - Business Wire",
        "content": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Build Asset Management (\u201cBuild\u201d), an investment manager focused on income and risk mitigation in public and private credit markets, announces the launch of the Build Secured Income Fund I in partnership with Unchained. The Fund is one of the first direct lending private credit funds that invests in over-collateralized consumer and business loans that are backed by bitcoin. The Fund, which began raising capital in June, seeks to offer a compelling yield profile designed to support the income needs of accredited investors and institutions while simultaneously giving borrowers in the emerging bitcoin economy access to dollar capital.\n\n\u201cSince its invention in 2008, the Bitcoin protocol has seen steady growth and adoption across the world, and we see real potential in bitcoin serving as a widely-adopted store of value and as quality collateral,\u201d says John Ruth, co-founder and CEO of Build. \u201cWe envision this fund\u2019s debut as laying pivotal groundwork for seamlessly weaving bitcoin into the economic fabric of our society while using our expertise to provide investors with a unique and differentiated income solution. Such solutions are critical in today\u2019s complex interest rate and inflation environment.\u201d\n\nBuild believes bitcoin\u2019s properties make it an exceptional form of collateral entirely unique in the credit space, specifically:\n\n\u25cf Potential for improved liquidity over traditional collateral: Because bitcoin is traded 24/7 in a highly liquid market, the collateral can be liquidated in a matter of minutes in the event of a loan default, unlike real estate or other commonly collateralized assets.\n\n\u25cf Multi-signature collaborative custody and no rehypothecation: Bitcoin's protocol ensures distinctive custody solutions that prevent rehypothecation (the use of pledged collateral assets by banks or brokers for their own purposes) by storing the bitcoin that backs each loan in visible and transparent multi-signature addresses. With keys distributed among the borrower, loan originator and a third-party agent, this setup not only prevents single points of failure but also permits transparency for the borrower and immediate access to the collateral for the lender.\n\n\u25cf Fixed supply of a scarce, fungible asset: Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity, enforced by a hard cap of 21 million bitcoin to be issued ever, along with a halving of new supply every four years, may increase the attractiveness of using the asset as collateral over time.\n\n\u201cWe founded Build to deliver solutions that improve investor outcomes in an era of disruption that probably won\u2019t mirror the investment landscape of the last 40 years,\u201d says Matt Dines, CFA, co-founder and Chief Investment Officer at Build. \u201cWe believe the unique properties of bitcoin are only just starting to be broadly understood, and we are motivated to lead the way by providing our clients new tools like this to help achieve the investment outcomes they desire.\u201d\n\nUnchained, a leader in financial services for bitcoin holders, is the originating agent and servicer of the loans purchased by the Fund. With collaborative three-party custody, 24/7 liquidity, and the transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain, Unchained\u2019s lending operation has experienced no dollar losses since its inception in 2017. These properties make the Fund a unique and potentially appealing option for accredited investors seeking yield with a reduced risk profile when compared to private credit funds backed by other assets as collateral.\n\nFor bitcoin holders, Unchained provides a way for borrowers to access US dollar capital without the need to sell their bitcoin, which often creates a significant tax event. The typical profile of loans held in the fund are interest-only, largely between $25,000 and $100,000, with an average loan-to-value ratio of 40%. The over-collateralization coupled with a strict margin call process may help manage the risk of Bitcoin price volatility and may protect against loss of principal for investors in the fund.\n\nThe private fund is accepting new investors now as a continuous offering. Investors must qualify as accredited investors or qualified purchasers before they can enter the fund.

        "content": "It's becoming clear that investor apathy in this year's crypto market is starting to hurt Coinbase , according to Mizuho analysts. The crypto exchange's trading volume historically has been influenced by moves in the price of bitcoin . But that trend has been falling apart since the beginning of the year, Mizuho managing director Dan Dolev said in a note Tuesday, calling it a \"stark\" and \"likely unprecedented\" bifurcation. Dolev highlighted that while bitcoin has risen from its fourth-quarter 2022 trough to an average of $28,500 in the third quarter to date, Coinbase's trading volumes have tumbled, from $145 billion in the first quarter to $92 billion in the second and on pace for $80 billion in the third. \"This indicates potential fatigue among retail customers,\" Dolev said. \"Unlike in prior cycles, FOMO no longer entices investors to trade bitcoin when prices rise the way it did in prior years. This could prove problematic for COIN.\" \"With retail accounting for 95% of trading revenue, we worry that the YTD rise in COIN's stock is unsustainable,\" he added. \"We expect a reality check to follow.\" Mizuho maintains its underperform rating and $27 price target on Coinbase shares. Dolev also said the spike in daily volumes that followed Grayscale's big win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug. 30 has faded, with September average daily trading volumes tracking below August levels by some 25%. Bitcoin trading volume across spot crypto exchanges is about in line with levels from Aug. 30, according to CryptoQuant. The price of bitcoin has remained stagnant in recent weeks despite having several positive developments during the same period on the regulatory and exchange-traded funds fronts. Those rallies have failed to hold, however, as the market suffers from low liquidity and volume. Others on Wall Street have said the next cycle in crypto will be led by institutions rather than retail investors and could be slower to take off as the industry and policymakers lay the appropriate groundwork for them. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "title": "$500 Million in Bitcoin Thrown Out With the Trash, Still the Strangest Crypto Tale Ever - autoevolution",
        "content": "Strange times bring forth the strangest stories, but few could hold a candle to this one. In the early days of the crypto market, one man mined thousands of Bitcoin \u2013 and then threw the hard drive with it into the trash.\n\nPhoto: BBC\n\nA tale not as old as time but as strange as the crypto bubble\n\nPhoto: Impossible_Ad_9325 / Reddit\n\nCouncil takes door number three\n\nPhoto: YouTube/Boston Dynamics\n\nIf you think viral pieces about someone losing the money for a new house in a national crypto scam are strange, you haven't heard nothing yet. That honor arguably goes to James Howells, a former IT professional from Newport, Wales \u2013 the multi-millionaire whose fortune lies in the local landfill, under tons of trash, and who just got denied (again!) from digging it up.For the past couple of years, Howells has been putting together an international team of experts, both in the field of data recovery and lost item recovery, after securing backing from two major investors. He's also been working on three approaches to the unique search and rescue mission, two of which required being granted access to the landfill by the Newport Council.His appeals have fallen on deaf ears once more, a local publication reports . Howells' appeal and his two plans have been denied on the same grounds as his previous appeals were shut down: there is no guarantee that the hard drive is at the location, the environmental risks for digging the landfill up are too great, and the operation would be a waste of council money.In the early days of the crypto market, Howells used to mine for Bitcoin out of the office in the home where he still lives today. He eventually had 7,500 Bitcoin (or 8,000, depending on which of his accounts you take into consideration) on a laptop hard drive. He placed the drive in a drawer after spilling lemonade on it, with the intention of recovering whatever was on it after it had dried.He never did because he forgot about it, just like he forgot about the Bitcoin. He ended up putting the drive in the garbage when he cleared out the room in 2013. He says he remembered the Bitcoin after he'd gone to bed, making a mental note to recover it from the trash before he took the bag to the bin.Howells' wife (now ex) woke up first, got ready for work, and took the garbage out on her way out. Howells says that he doesn't blame her for inadvertently throwing out his fortune, but they've since divorced. He's also spent the last decade trying to convince the council to allow him to dig around the landfill.And with good reason: whether you consider the crypto market the digital future or the biggest scam of modern times, there's no denying the fact that real money comes out of it. When Howells accidentally threw the drive into the trash bag, the Bitcoin on it was worth a few thousand dollars. At the peak of the crypto market, its value shot up to more than $500 million but has since dwindled to \"just\u201d $216 million as of August 2023.When we last covered Howells' strange case, he'd gathered a huge team of experts, including specialists from Ontrack, which previously assisted NASA with recovering the drive on the Columbia space shuttle that crashed on Earth in 2003, environmental specialists, and even former council workers.His number 1 plan was to concentrate his efforts on an area of the landfill measuring about 200 square meters (2,153 square feet) and 15 meters (49 feet) deep. The team would use a couple of Boston Dynamics robot dogs , landfill excavation, AI-powered sorting, and waste management to recover the drive, and Ontrack would do the rest, recovering the data on it \u2013 assuming it wasn't cracked \"in a million pieces.\"The Bitcoin fortune would then be divided into three: Howells would keep a chunk, his team would get the other, and the third would go to the council, the community, and a variety of environmental organizations. As Howells saw it, it was an everybody-wins-type of situation.Plan number 2 was the same, except it would extend to the entire landfill , so it would take as much as 3 years and a lot more money. Plan number 3 was to sue the council and force its hand. The council has clearly chosen door number 3, so they can kiss the 1/3 of the money Howells had promised goodbye.Howells says he's now put together a legal team, and they've sent the council a final warning: they have until September 18 to grant Howells access, or the matter is going to court. Howells argues that, since the hard drive left his home without his consent, it's technically theft of private property, so the council is an accomplice to theft by denying him the chance to recover it.As a slightly funnier aside, Howells says he has been unemployed all these years because he needed to focus on his rescue operation exclusively. Plus, he has no reason to work for someone else when he has $216 million buried in the ground. He swears he has no regrets about the incident but is actually proud of being an early crypto adopter Sometimes, looking at the brighter side of things reallythe only option.A spokesperson for the council says that they have no intention of reconsidering their original decision, which they communicated to Howells in 2013 and repeated several times already. Moreover, they won't be talking to the media anymore concerning the case because it's too much of a waste of time and public money."

        "title": "How to cash out your Bitcoin safely - Business Insider Africa",
        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s demand has increased dramatically. So, if you\u2019ve held onto your Bitcoin for some time, you can sell it for a profit. You may also trade Bitcoin and invest your money into something else. Regardless of your decision, you may want to know the safest way.\n\nMost people know Bitcoin as a digital currency. It doesn\u2019t exist physically but digital data in the blockchain. Blockchain technology makes Bitcoin secure; no central authority or government controls it. Its protocol limits the number of digital coins that will ever exist to 21 million tokens. This supply limit gives Bitcoin its value.\n\nAs miners near the supply limit, Bitcoin demand increases. That means you can sell the Bitcoins you bought a decade ago at a higher price. Most people purchase Bitcoin on platforms like Immediate Momentum. These allow individuals to sign up and use fiat money to buy Bitcoin. But how do you cash out your Bitcoin? Here\u2019s how to convert Bitcoin into cash.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCrypto Exchange\n\nYou can quickly sell your Bitcoins via a crypto exchange. Crypto exchanges are digital platforms that bring together cryptocurrency buyers and sellers. Some specialize in Bitcoin, but others accept various cryptocurrencies. Using these platforms to cash out Bitcoin is straightforward. Register and load Bitcoins from your wallet into your crypto exchange account. After that, place a sell order to convert Bitcoins into cash. Send the funds to the bank account you used to register once you sell Bitcoins.\n\nPeer-to-Peer Trade\n\nDirect trade is also another option for cashing out Bitcoin. And this involves selling Bitcoins to somebody else via another entity. Online peer-to-peer platforms allow sellers to get offers from willing buyers. You will agree on the fiat currency the buyer will use to pay for the Bitcoins. A crypto exchange often facilitates these transactions. Once you decide to trade, the online platform will escrow your Bitcoins and release them after you confirm receiving the fiat money you agreed with the buyer.\n\nFace-to-Face Transaction\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYou can also sell your Bitcoin at your preferred in-person location. For instance, you may find a family member or friend that wants to buy Bitcoin. However, this method requires knowledge of crypto wallets and how to transfer Bitcoins to another person.\n\nAlso, research is vital when using this method because Bitcoin\u2019s value fluctuates rapidly. Therefore, know this cryptocurrency\u2019s value when selling it. Nevertheless, you can use the current rates on a prominent crypto exchange to determine the price to sell your Bitcoin.\n\nSome places have physical shops or locations where you can sell Bitcoins. Nevertheless, be cautious when using this method to cash out Bitcoin to ensure you receive payment for your cryptocurrency. Release your Bitcoins only after receiving fiat money, especially when selling your crypto asset to a stranger.\n\nBitcoin ATMs\n\nBitcoin ATMs enable cryptocurrency users to access their cash immediately using the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin ATMs operate differently from traditional ATMs because they require you to scan a QR code to sell Bitcoin and receive payment in fiat cash. You can use the internet to find a Bitcoin ATM near you. However, prepare to pay a higher transaction fee if you use this method to cash out your Bitcoins. Also, some Bitcoin ATMs allow users to buy Bitcoin but not sell it. Others allow only users with existing accounts to use them to trade Bitcoins, and the registration process takes time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFinal Word\n\nYou can cash out your Bitcoin in various ways. Crypto exchanges provide the most popular way to sell Bitcoin and receive fiat cash payments. Nevertheless, choose a well-known and reliable Bitcoin exchange to ensure you receive your funds after selling Bitcoin.\n\n--"

        "content": "Franklin Templeton entered the spot bitcoin ETF race on Tuesday, the most recent of the traditional Wall Street investment firms that are looking to sell digital asset products alongside more upstart companies.\n\nAccording to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Franklin Bitcoin ETF would be listed on the CBOE BZX Exchange. Crypto trading platform Coinbase would be the custodian. The proposed fund doesn\u2019t have a ticker symbol yet.\n\nFranklin Templeton has $13.1 billion in assets under management across 60 exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe firm\u2019s filing comes as more traditional financial firms move into cryptocurrency ETFs. Investment giants BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investment Co. have both filed for spot bitcoin ETFs, and many experts speculate that the SEC could give those firms priority if it approves the investment vehicles.\n\nWhile the SEC allows funds that track bitcoin futures contracts, such as the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the agency has blocked and delayed proposals for ETFs that track physically backed bitcoin. The SEC has rejected more than 30 proposals for a spot bitcoin ETF since 2021, including those from Fidelity and VanEck and has blocked such funds since 2017 on the grounds that they are vulnerable to fraud and market manipulation.\n\nOn Aug. 29, however, cryptocurrency investment firm Grayscale Investments prevailed in a watershed legal victory over the SEC, when the U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit ruled that the SEC must reconsider Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The SEC had previously rejected Grayscale\u2019s application. The ruling could mean that the SEC will eventually approve spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSEC Chairman Gensler: \u2018Crypto Rife With Fraud\u2019\n\nAs the SEC faces mounting pressure to approve more cryptocurrency ETFs, Chairman Gary Gensler hasn\u2019t backed down from his position that digital assets are an unsafe investment.

Circuit or the Supreme Court. The agency could go as far as to roll back its approval of bitcoin futures ETFs if it doubles down on an anti-cryptocurrency stance.\n\nThe fund would be Franklin Templeton\u2019s first jump into digital asset ETFs.

        "title": "Bitcoin data highlights 3 key reasons why investors don't care about BTC price - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Much has been made of Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) poor price action as of late, with many analysts making the case for further bearish momentum in the weeks ahead.\n\nYet it wasn\u2019t too long ago that many investors and crypto pundits were raving about some noteworthy fundamental metrics that were, and continue to be, quite bullish.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at three Bitcoin metrics that bulls might keep in mind.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hash rate hovers near a record high\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hash rate, a metric showing the amount of computing power dedicated to mining BTC, recently hit a record high, indicating the overall strength of the network and continued interest from miners. There has never been more security in Bitcoin, and it highlights the fact that miners appear to have faith in the future of the Bitcoin network.\n\nThere\u2019s some controversy as to whether or not a high hash rate constitutes a bullish signal. Investors equate the increased hashing power as a sign of an impending price increase, while others say the opposite, or that no correlation exists at all.\n\nWhen looking at the past year\u2019s data, there does appear to be a distinct relationship between hash rate and price.\n\nBitcoin total hash rate vs. market price (USD), 1-year chart. Source: Blockchain.com\n\nThis makes perfect sense, given that miners will eventually begin to mine more when prices rise. The hash rate and miners\u2019 actions are also impacted by the Bitcoin difficulty adjustment that occurs roughly every two weeks. As the hash rate rises, so does the difficulty, meaning it requires more energy to mine 1 BTC.\n\nA higher hash rate can only sustain lower prices for so long because miners\u2019 cost of production increases with difficulty, while their profits diminish. Therefore, either the price must rise or the hash rate will fall at some point.\n\nCurrently, the price has fallen significantly relative to the hash rate. The last time this happened in June, a rally followed.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners need BTC price over $98K by the halving \u2014 Analysis\n\nIn addition to the hash rate rising, there appears to be renewed mining interest from nation-states. The country of Oman has announced plans to produce 7% of the Bitcoin hash rate less than two years from now.\n\nJUST IN: Oman plans to produce 7% of the global #Bitcoin hash rate by June 2025! pic.twitter.com/HOJDlCcyBU \u2014 Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) September 10, 2023\n\nBitcoin addresses holding 0.1 BTC at all-time high\n\nBitcoin hodlers have remained strong throughout the bear market, with the number of wallets holding 0.1 BTC or more reaching 12 million for the first time. This trend has continued despite the current range-bound price action dotted with occasional corrections.\n\nBitcoin addresses with balance of over 0.01 BTC vs. price. Source: Look Into Bitcoin\n\nThis demonstrates a degree of trust in the asset class in spite of everything else happening in the market. Adoption is growing even as prices disappoint.\n\nWhile 0.1 BTC may have once been a trivial amount, today it\u2019s significant, as this represents about $2,500 at current prices. The fiat value can be much higher when priced in other currencies. 12 million entities having amassed this much Bitcoin shows how seriously the world has begun to take such an investment.\n\nBitcoin balances held on exchanges trend down\n\nThe number of wallets holding significant amounts of Bitcoin has also risen, while the amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges has been trending lower since the collapse of FTX in November 2022. This trend has ramped up since April 2023. This indicates that individuals are taking self-custody of their coins, possibly highlighting their disinterest in selling in the near future.\n\nBTC price vs balance held on exchanges one-year chart. Source: Coinglass\n\nOver the last week, the BTC balance held on exchanges has declined from 1.88 million to 1.84 million. Historically, an influx of coins to exchanges has tended to precede a time of selling pressure, while outflows from exchanges have buoyed the Bitcoin price.\n\nTaken together, these three metrics show that investors\u2019 thesis for buying Bitcoin has grown stronger than ever. Bitcoin miners keep mining, hodlers keep hodling, and individuals continue to take custody of their coins.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Is Bitcoin Mining Legit? Protecting Your Personal Information\n\nBitcoin mining has gained significant attention in recent years as a way to earn cryptocurrencies and potentially make real money.\n\nHowever, it is essential to understand the process and the potential risks involved.\n\nIn this article, we will explore what bitcoin mining is, how it works, and the importance of protecting your personal information throughout the process.\n\nBy the end, you will have a comprehensive understanding of Bitcoin mining and the steps you can take to safeguard your data.\n\nAlso read: Crypto: 6 of 25 ETFs are non-Bitcoin, Ethereum-centric.\n\nBitcoin cryptocurrencies and graph statistic background\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are created and added to the blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions.\n\nAdditionally, it involves solving complex math problems through a process called \u201cproof of work.\u201d\n\nMiners compete to solve these math problems, and the first miner to find the correct solution is rewarded with bitcoins.\n\nAlso read: Franklin Templeton Files for the Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe Process of Bitcoin Mining\n\nTo better grasp how Bitcoin mining works, let\u2019s break down the process into a few key steps:\n\nTransaction Verification: When someone initiates a Bitcoin transaction, it needs to be verified by miners. Miners ensure that the transaction is valid and complies with the blockchain rules. Competing to Solve Math Problems: Miners use powerful computers to compete and solve math problems. These math problems require significant computing power and electricity. Adding Transactions to the Blockchain: Once a miner successfully solves a math problem, they add the verified transactions to the blockchain. This process ensures the integrity and security of the Bitcoin network. Rewards for Miners: Miners are rewarded with newly created bitcoins for their efforts in solving math problems and adding transactions to the blockchain. This serves as an incentive for miners to continue the mining process.\n\nThe risks of mining\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nWhile bitcoin mining can be a legitimate way to earn cryptocurrencies, there are risks associated with the process.\n\nOne of the most significant risks involves the protection of personal information.\n\nFurthermore, hackers and scammers often target Bitcoin miners and mining enthusiasts to gain access to their personal data.\n\nIs Bitcoin mining legit with the threat of malware?\n\nOne common method used by hackers is the distribution of malware. Malware is malicious software designed to gain unauthorized access to computers and steal sensitive information.\n\nFurthermore, hackers can install Bitcoin mining malware on unsuspecting users\u2019 computers, allowing them to use the resources of those computers for their mining operations.\n\nProtecting your personal information\n\nTo protect your personal information while engaging in Bitcoin mining, it is crucial to follow these essential steps:\n\nStay vigilant: Be cautious of suspicious emails, websites, or applications related to Bitcoin mining. Hackers often use phishing techniques to trick users into revealing their personal information. Keep an eye out for any signs of scams or malicious activities. Use Reliable Security Software: Install a reliable security solution with built-in protection against malware, phishing attempts, and online fraud. This will help detect and block any potential threats to your personal information. Be Mindful of Passwords: Create strong and unique passwords for your mining accounts and ensure that you never share them with anyone. Consider using a password manager to securely store your passwords. Secure Your Network: Ensure that your home network is secure by using strong encryption, such as WPA2, and regularly updating your Wi-Fi router\u2019s firmware. This will help prevent unauthorized access to your mining activities and personal information. Regularly Update Software: Keep your mining software and operating system up-to-date with the latest security patches. Updates often include important security fixes that can protect against known vulnerabilities. Encrypt Your Data: Consider encrypting your mining data and personal files using encryption software. Encryption adds an extra layer of protection, making it more challenging for hackers to access your sensitive information. Use Two-Factor Authentication: Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a unique code sent to your mobile device, in addition to your password. Educate yourself: Stay informed about the latest security threats and best practices for protecting your personal information. Educating yourself will help you make informed decisions and avoid falling victim to scams or malware attacks.\n\nSource: Wazirx\n\nConclusion: Is Bitcoin Mining Legit?\n\nIn conclusion, are you still wondering, \u201cIs Bitcoin Mining Legit?\u201d\n\nTo some, yes. Bitcoin mining can be a legitimate way to earn cryptocurrencies, but it is essential to understand the risks involved. Protecting your personal information should be a top priority throughout the mining process.\n\nBy following the steps outlined in this article and staying vigilant, you can help safeguard your data and enjoy the benefits of Bitcoin mining without falling victim to scams or hackers.\n\nRemember, knowledge and proactive measures are your best defense in the world of Bitcoin mining.

        "content": "In a move that further legitimizes Bitcoin in institutional finance, the global investment giant Franklin Templeton filed a regulatory Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, seeking approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe development comes at a time when the race to launch the first US spot Bitcoin ETF is hotly contested, with entrants including incumbents like Fidelity and BlockRock, as well as upstarts like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nFranklin Templeton, managing approximately $1.5 trillion in assets, is looking to capitalize on the growing demand for Bitcoin investments. Their proposed ETF, if approved, would provide investors with a more accessible and regulated means to gain exposure to the world's leading cryptocurrency.\n\nThe filing outlines plans for the Franklin Templeton Digital Asset Trust, which aims to track the performance of Bitcoin.\n\nSeveral other investment firms have submitted similar applications in recent years, but none have yet received SEC approval.\n\nStill, over the past few years, Bitcoin has garnered attention as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, driving institutions to diversify their portfolios.\n\nIn their filing, Franklin Templeton highlighted the benefits of a Bitcoin ETF, such as improved liquidity and ease of trading for investors, without the need for them to directly hold and manage cryptocurrency assets. This approach is expected to be more appealing to conservative investors who are still hesitant about the complexities of Bitcoin custody and security.\n\nHowever, the road to launching a Bitcoin ETF in the United States has been a challenging one, with the SEC consistently emphasizing the need for robust investor protections and market surveillance. Franklin Templeton's application will be subject to a thorough regulatory review, which could take several months before a final decision is reached.\n\nIf approved, the Franklin Templeton Digital Asset Trust would join the growing list of cryptocurrency ETFs available to U.S. investors, including the many Bitcoin Futures ETFs now live on various ex\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Greenidge Generation continues to mine Bitcoin, profit while it violates NY climate law - Gothamist",
        "content": "More than a year has passed since the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation rejected the air permit application of Greenidge Generation, a Finger Lakes power plant that fuels a Bitcoin-mining operation by burning natural gas.\n\nAccording to publicly available documents, the cryptomining company is on pace for its most lucrative year to date as its appeal undergoes an administrative review with the state. The company is also operating with a water permit that expired last year.\n\nLocal community members and advocacy groups have pushed for Greenidge\u2019s closure ever since 2018 when its air permit was up for a customary five-year renewal. In June 2022, the DEC rejected the renewal application on the grounds that the company had violated the Community Leadership and Climate Protection Act, or CLCPA \u2014 the state\u2019s signature climate law that requires all industries and sectors to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by the end of this decade. Cryptocurrency mining consumes large amounts of energy due to the large computer farms needed to solve the complex algorithms that release new coins.\n\nThe DEC\u2019s assessment at the time was that Greenidge had no evidence of any plans to significantly reduce its actual emissions.\n\nA month later, the company\u2019s water permit came under jeopardy. The DEC cited the facility for operating without fish screens on its 7-foot-diameter intake pipes, which suck in nearly 140 million gallons of water from Seneca Lake each day at a maximum rate of 68,000 gallons per minute. Doing so can be deadly for fish and other aquatic life that gets sucked in, and fish screens are an inexpensive and standard practice at power plants, according to Edwin Cowen, a civil engineering professor at Cornell University. In January, the screens were installed after more than five years of operation without them.\n\nGreenidge is appealing the air permit decision with an administrative law judge at the DEC\u2019s Office of Hearings and Mediation Services, as part of the agency\u2019s standard process for enforcement. This judge is an \u201can impartial person designated by the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation who independently evaluates the evidence,\u201d according to the DEC.\n\nIn the meantime, the company has amassed a total of 1,368 Bitcoins for the first half of this year \u2013 a 16% increase over the same period last year. That amount of Bitcoin would be valued around $35 million as of Tuesday. Adding in its other Securities and Exchange Commission filings during its first three years of operation, the company has produced 7,111 Bitcoins currently valued at $186 million since the mining operation started in 2020.\n\nGreenidge did not respond to a request for comment from Gothamist.\n\nWithout a strict timeline for proceedings, environmental groups fear that upstate cryptominers could continue to operate and pollute for years as a result of multiple appeals even if the administrative law judge upholds the DEC\u2019s permit denial.\n\nThis loophole could be attractive for other cryptomining operations looking to acquire defunct fossil fuel plants upstate."

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $25,729, down 0.53% while Ethereum (ETH), Tether USDt, BNB , USD Coin, XRP Dogecoin, Cardano and Solana fell up to 2%.ETH was trading at $1,580.67 while Dogecoin was at $0.06124.\"In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin briefly lost its crucial support at $25,000 for the first time in almost three months. For BTC to not enter panic mode, $24,500 support remains sacrosanct. This is the level above which BTC has been trading for almost 6 months now. As for ETH, which fell 2.8%, the support of $1,600 has been breached and it is currently trading around $1,550,\" Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk said.In Hudda's opinion, a major catalyst for SOL\u2019s ($17.95) sell-off is still Wednesday's expectation of FTX unlock, pointing out that this cryptocurrency was already down by around 50% from its recent high in July. \"Additionally, given that a majority of the SOL is time-locked for FTX, we could very well see a 'sell the rumor, buy the news\u2019 event playing out on Tuesday,\" he added.Prospects of cryptocurrency, which has an inverse relationship with the US dollar, will be hinging upon the movement in the USD as investors in different asset classes await US CPI Data slated for release today, along with the US Producer Price Index (PPI) data and the retail sales data which is expected to be published on Thursday.Among the top-performing cryptocurrencies, MKR leads with a remarkable gain of 120%, followed by OMG with 35%, ZIL with 26% and MATIC with 15%. The biggest losers include ENS with a significant drop of 69%, WAVES with 64%, COTI with 38%, GNS with 28% and REP with 26%.\"The 'Three Black Crows' candlestick pattern on the 4-hour time frame signals a continuation of the bearish trend. Bitcoin is currently in oversold territory with indicators such as the RSI below 30 indicating an exhaustion of sellers, which may lead to a brief bullish correction before another downtrend. MACD is also in a sell zone with bearish histograms below zero,\" Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO, Unocoin said.Vishwanath said that the Bitcoin price was currently below the 50-day EMA at $25,500, reinforcing bearish sentiment and BTC could face resistance around $25,400 and a small bullish correction to $25,600 may precede a deeper decline towards $24,800. \"The descending trend line at $25,600 is a significant barrier, but an upside breakout could push Bitcoin to $26,400 or even $46,000,\" he added.A break below $24,800 could lead to support at $24,000 the Unocoin CEO said.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "title": "Will a Spot-Based Bitcoin ETF Ever Be Available? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The bitcoin community has been anticipating the debut of a spot-based Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). For years, investors have been anticipating the advent of such a financial product, which would allow them to acquire exposure to Bitcoin's price changes without having to deal with the complications of holding and keeping the digital commodity.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds\n\nBefore digging into the prospects of a spot-based Bitcoin ETF, it's critical to understand the nature of these investment vehicles. An ETF is a sort of investment fund and exchange-traded product that has stock exchange-tradable shares. A Bitcoin ETF, for example, would draw its value from the price of Bitcoin, allowing investors to purchase and sell shares that track the cryptocurrency's performance.\n\nBitcoin ETFs are classified into two types: futures-based and spot-based. Bitcoin futures contracts, which are financial derivatives connected to the future price of Bitcoin, are invested in by futures-based ETFs. Spot-based ETFs, on the other hand, seek to directly own and store physical Bitcoin, closely following its price swings.\n\nRegulatory Obstacles\n\nOne of the major impediments to the introduction of a spot-based Bitcoin ETF is regulatory scrutiny. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States has often expressed worry about the possibility of market manipulation and fraud in the cryptocurrency market. These problems have resulted in a number of rejections of proposals for spot-based Bitcoin ETFs throughout the years.\n\nThe SEC's main concerns about spot-based Bitcoin ETFs are market surveillance and custody. The Commission is adamant about having strong safeguards in place to protect investors and ensure the safe custody of underlying assets. Regulators want robust oversight to detect and deter fraudulent activity in the bitcoin business.\n\nThe Impact of Bitcoin ETFs Based on Futures\n\nWhile spot Bitcoin ETFs are still elusive, their futures-based counterparts have made great progress. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) became the first futures-based Bitcoin ETF to get SEC clearance in October 2021. This watershed moment in the cryptocurrency investment scene allowed investors to obtain exposure to Bitcoin via a regulated ETF structure.\n\nThe SEC's clearance of BITO indicated that it is willing to examine cryptocurrency-related financial products under certain circumstances. It also emphasized the SEC's preference for futures-based products, which it believes provide better regulatory supervision and surveillance than spot-based alternatives.\n\nThe Difficulties of Spot-Based Bitcoin ETFs\n\nSpot-based Bitcoin ETFs have distinct obstacles that set them apart from futures-based rivals. One of the most critical difficulties is the lack of a secure and dependable custodial solution for Bitcoin storage. To prevent theft, loss, or mismanagement of digital assets, safe storage and custody are critical.\n\nFurthermore, spot-based ETFs must manage market manipulation and price volatility, both of which are present in the cryptocurrency market. The SEC needs sophisticated measures to monitor and deter fraudulent activity, guaranteeing that the underlying asset of the ETF, in this case, Bitcoin, is not subject to manipulation.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of regulatory clarity surrounding cryptocurrencies complicates the creation of spot-based Bitcoin ETFs. The regulatory framework for digital assets is continually changing, with different regulations and norms being implemented by different jurisdictions. While addressing the SEC's concerns, ETF sponsors must traverse this complex web of requirements.\n\nPerspectives for the Future\n\nWhile the legal environment and hurdles are daunting, the prospects for a spot-based Bitcoin ETF are not completely gloomy. Several variables could potentially pave the way for the future establishment of such an ETF.\n\nFor starters, the SEC's view may be influenced by the bitcoin market's continuous development and maturing. Regulators may get more comfortable with the idea of spot-based ETFs as the market evolves and institutionalizes. Increased market surveillance, liquidity, and industry standardization may all help to reduce some of the concerns about market manipulation.\n\nSecond, the development of regulated cryptocurrency custodians may alleviate the custody issue. One of the primary regulatory concerns could be alleviated if established financial institutions enter the bitcoin market and provide secure storage options.\n\nThird, foreign developments in bitcoin legislation may have an impact on the SEC's decision. If other nations successfully establish spot-based Bitcoin ETFs with proper regulatory safeguards, the SEC may reconsider its position.\n\nFinally, regulatory coordination and conversation between the bitcoin business and regulatory bodies are critical. An open and positive debate can assist authorities in better understanding the complexities of the cryptocurrency business and how to undertake effective regulation without impeding innovation.\n\nInvestor Interest\n\nInvestors' appetite for a spot-based Bitcoin ETF remains strong. ETFs are an appealing alternative for investors wishing to add Bitcoin exposure to their portfolios due to their ease of use and familiarity as investing vehicles. Furthermore, an ETF would give institutional investors with a regulated and efficient mechanism to obtain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially contributing to significant capital inflows into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe approval of Bitcoin ETFs based on futures contracts, such as BITO, has proven investor interest in these products. It's logical to believe that a spot-based ETF that more closely tracks Bitcoin's price swings would create even more investor interest.\n\nSEC Faces Dilemma Following Court Ruling on Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has handed the SEC a significant setback in its quest to regulate Bitcoin ETFs. The court ruled in favor of Grayscale in a lawsuit against the SEC, potentially opening the door for a Bitcoin ETF approval. Previously, the SEC denied Grayscale's request to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF, citing concerns about market manipulation.\n\nThe court's ruling directly challenges the SEC's reasoning for rejecting spot Bitcoin ETFs in recent years. The SEC has argued that it cannot approve such ETFs due to the lack of a regulated crypto market of sufficient size to prevent manipulation. However, the court pointed out that the SEC had previously approved a futures-based Bitcoin product, implying that if one is allowed, the other should be as well, as both markets are interconnected.\n\nThe court stated that the SEC's denial of Grayscale's proposal was \"arbitrary and capricious\" because the regulator failed to explain its differing treatment of similar products. While this ruling doesn't address the manipulation concerns, it questions the SEC's inconsistent stance on Bitcoin-related ETFs.\n\nThe SEC now faces several decisions. It can appeal the case, potentially prolonging the process. Alternatively, it could approve one or more of the nine pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications, aligning with the court's ruling. The applicants include Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Ark/21 Shares Bitcoin Trust, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust, and others.\n\nAnother option is to delay a decision, as the SEC has up to 240 days to approve or deny applications, meaning a decision might be deferred until January 10, 2024. Lastly, the SEC could devise new arguments against approval, although it's unclear what those might be.\n\nThis development leaves the SEC at a crossroads, with potential implications for the broader cryptocurrency market and its growing integration with traditional finance.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe enigmatic spot-based Bitcoin ETF continues to enchant the cryptocurrency and investing sectors. While regulatory obstacles and constraints remain, recent developments, like as the licensing of futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, provide rays of hope.\n\nThe future of spot-based Bitcoin ETFs is dependent on a fine balance of regulatory scrutiny, industry growth, and technological advancements. It remains to be seen if authorities will accept spot-based ETFs as a legitimate and secure means of accessing the bitcoin market as the sector evolves.\n\nInvestors and industry stakeholders are keeping a careful eye on the regulatory landscape, hoping for the day when a spot-based Bitcoin ETF will be accessible. Until then, the industry must be patient and proactive in addressing regulatory concerns while encouraging bitcoin innovation. The introduction of a spot-based Bitcoin ETF would surely be a watershed moment in the continuous integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance."

Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $25,879.58, up 0.80% while Ethereum (ETH), Tether USDt, BNB , USD Coin, XRP gained up to 0.69%.Other crypto tokens such as Cardano, Dogecoin , and Solana fell up to 1.07%.ETH was trading at $1,582.98, up 0.33% while Dogecoin was at $0.06067, lower by 0.17%.Cryptocurrencies have an inverse relationship with the US dollar. The dollar index was trading at 104.67 with a slightly negative bias.In the last seven days, Bitcoin has gained by 0.57% while ETH is down by 2.28% during this period, Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX on the Crypto Market said. \"The Exponential Moving Average for 10-day EMA indicates 'Buy' in BTC at $25,858 and 200-day EMA indicates 'Sell' at $27,005. Meanwhile, 10-day SMA indicates 'Buy' at $25,817 and 200-day SMA indicates 'Sell' at $27,655,\" Menon said.Edul Patel, CEO & Co-Founder of Mudrex attributes the price surge in Bitcoin above $25,900 to renewed interest in the Bitcoin Spot ETF race. He said that Franklin Templeton, a major player in the asset management industry, has submitted an application to the US SEC, which could have caused this positive market sentiment. \"Notably, the number of wallets holding 0.1 BTC reached an all-time high of 12 million recently, which suggests growing trust among investors in Bitcoin. Ethereum, on the other hand, continues to trade around the $1600 mark,\" Patel said.Among the top gainers, MKR rose 125%, followed by OMG with a 35% increase, ZIL with 26%, REEF with 10% and BTG with an 8% gain, Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO, Unocoin informed while highlighting biggest losers as ENS which is down 69%, WAVES down 64%, COTI down 38%, GNS down 28% and REP down 26%.On the strategy front, Vishwanath said, \"Bitcoin technical analysis reveals strong bullish trend. Primary technical indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average of Convergence (MACD) indicate a favorable buying zone. Additionally, the 50-day exponential moving average supports a continued bullish trajectory as long as Bitcoin remains above $25,600. A decline below this level could test the support at $25,400 and the critical $24,950 level. Conversely, a break above the $26,500 resistance may target the $27,000 and $27,500 levels\".(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "It is now two years after El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender. Since September 7 2021, when the daring decision was made by President Nayib Bukele\u2019s government, numerous events of significance have transpired.\n\nThe Terra Luna ecosystem has crashed, the FTX debacle has occurred and on a more positive note, an African country, Central African Republic (CAR) sort of followed El Salvador\u2019s trajectory in 2022.\n\nRelated post: Central African Republic launches official crypto, Sango Coin\n\nHowever, has the El Salvador Bitcoin Law bettered the livelihood of its citizens? Are the pros more than the cons? Is it advisable for other countries to toe El Salvador\u2019s path? Let\u2019s have a look.\n\nThe state of Bitcoin as El Salvador\u2019s legal currency\n\nThe landmark decision, championed by President Nayib Bukele\u2019s government, demonstrated the trust vested in Bitcoin and it was well received by crypto enthusiasts at the time.\n\nHowever, two years down the line, trends have shown that the decision by the ambitious president might not be going as planned. Integrating Bitcoin into daily life has presented numerous challenges to El Salvadorians.\n\nFirstly, like almost every other developing country, cash is still king in El Salvador and almost 70% of its population is unbanked. Also, assessments say the Bitcoin transition leaves behind those who do not have a smartphone (predominantly older Salvadorans) and those without internet access.\n\n\n\nSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele delivers his annual address to the nation marking his second year in office at the Legislative Assembly in San Salvador on June 1, 2021. (Photo by MARVIN RECINOS / AFP) (Photo by MARVIN RECINOS/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAdditionally, it can be found out that the project was not well thought out before it was implemented because many Salvadorans were clueless about Bitcoin before it was found out their country planned to make it legal tender. A poll of around 1,300 Salvadorans by the Central American University leading up to the rollout showed only about 10% of respondents fully understood cryptocurrency.\n\nRead also: Central African Republic (CAR) creates a 15-member committee to draft crypto bill\n\nAlso, it was discovered that many citizens just downloaded the Chivo Wallet App, spent the $30 bitcoin incentives and ditched the app, and bitcoin usage altogether.\n\nNayib Bukele takes pride in purchasing Bitcoin with government funds. To date, the government has acquired over 2,000 bitcoins. But since reaching a high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, the price of a single bitcoin has fallen, reducing the value of the country\u2019s Bitcoin holdings by over 60%.\n\nShould any country make Bitcoin a legal tender at this point?\n\nAs a nascent and speculative asset, it is not advisable for a country to embark on the experimental journey that El Salvador is attempting, at least for now.\n\nCentral Africa Republic, in April 2022 sort of followed the Central American country\u2019s footprint, although theirs was much on its proposed blockchain-based Sango Project. The reception in the African country has not been positive and no development of significance has been heard of the project recently.\n\nAlso, economists have speculated on a link between the El Salvador Bitcoin bonds and its debt crisis. This put the country in a terrible fix because the country has been chided by the International Monetary Fund which has constantly told Nayib Bukele to discard Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nWhat could be deduced from the whole scenario is that Bitcoin City plans, the Sango Project and other \u2018revolutionary ideas\u2019 being embarked on are too utopian, especially for developing countries in Africa.\n\n\n\nTop court in Central African Republic (CAR) rules against crypto purchase of e-residency, land and citizenship\n\nCAR aims to create a crypto island and a citizenship scheme based on cryptocurrency investment while the majority of its citizens still lack access to basic infrastructural developments like electricity, internet and smartphones.\n\nAlso, with major financial institutions like the IMF at odds with Bitcoin, making that move would complicate relationships with regional and international agencies. With this, it is important to consider the challenges attached before embarking on a project that might eventually end up as a bubble, affecting the lives of millions, in the process.\n\nLastly\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s decision to embrace Bitcoin as legal tender is a historic moment in finance. It demonstrates the nation\u2019s boldness in embracing innovation for the benefit of its citizens. Even though the country faces numerous challenges, its commitment to Bitcoin remains steadfast and could be applauded."

        "content": "TensorFlow is the most popular machine learning platform and the Node version, TensorFlow.js, makes it easy to use in a JavaScript application. In this article, we\u2019ll combine two of the most interesting technologies of the day: cryptocurrency and AI. We\u2019ll train a neural network to make a price prediction based on a set of historical Bitcoin prices, then check it against the actual price of Bitcoins during a given date range.\n\nStart the project\n\nYou\u2019ll need Node/NPM installed to start. Then you can create a new directory and run npm init , and accept the defaults. Next, install TensorFlow by entering npm i tensorflow/tfjs . That's the only dependency you need for this demo.\n\nThe application consists of three files:\n\npredict.js to handle the command-line interaction.\n\nto handle the command-line interaction. fetchPriceData.js to get the price data.\n\nto get the price data. > trainAndPredict.js to make predictions.\n\npredict.js is typical Node.js for handling command-line arguments. There are some niceties added for cleaning up the arguments, which we won't bother with here. The basic idea is that the user runs predict.js and passes in three arguments:\n\nThe token symbol (like Bitcoin, Solana, and so on)\n\nThe end date\n\nThe number of days to go back\n\nIf you don\u2019t provide anything, the program defaults to Bitcoin, ending today, going back 90 days.\n\nSet up the prediction\n\nWe\u2019re using the CoinGecko API, which is particular about how it returns historical data. If the time range covers more than 90 days, it\u2019ll automatically use a daily interval instead of hourly. Our code will handle either, but by default, we\u2019ll use three months of hourly data, ending today. (CoinGecko wants the timestamps in seconds, not milliseconds, so that explains the odd juggling of 1000s in calculating start and end dates.)\n\nThe predict.js file is shown in Listing 1.\n\nListing 1. predict.js\n\nconst fetchPriceData = require('./fetchPriceData'); const trainAndPredict = require('./trainAndPredict.js'); const [tokenSymbol] = process.argv.slice(2); // Set default if argument not provided const defaultTokenSymbol = 'bitcoin'; // CoinGecko likes timestamps in seconds, not ms const endDate = new Date(Date.now()) / 1000; const startDate = new Date((endDate * 1000) - 90 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Use default values if arguments are not present const finalTokenSymbol = tokenSymbol || defaultTokenSymbol; async function main(){ try { const { timePrices, predictTime, actualPrice } = await fetchPriceData(finalTokenSymbol, startDate, endDate); const results = await trainAndPredict(timePrices, predictTime); console.log(`Prediction for ${new Date(predictTime)}: ${results} `); console.log(`Actual: ${actualPrice}`); } catch (error) { console.error('Error:', error); } } main();\n\nThis code won\u2019t run until we create the two modules for it to import. predict.js uses those modules, fetchPriceData and trainAndPredict , to get the price data and run the AI. The fetchPriceData module returns three things:\n\nAn array of timestamps and prices\n\nA timestamp used to predict the price of Bitcoins\n\nThe actual price at that time\n\nWe\u2019ll use the actual price to compare the AI's prediction to what really happened.\n\nGet the price data\n\nTo get our price data, we use the CoinGecko API to define the fetchPriceData module, as shown in Listing 2.\n\nListing 2. fetchPriceData.js\n\nasync function fetchPriceData(tokenSymbol, fromTimestamp, toTimestamp) { try { const url = `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/${tokenSymbol}/market_chart/range?vs_currency=usd&from=${fromTimestamp}&to=${toTimestamp}`; console.info(\"Getting price data from: \" + url); const response = await fetch(url); const data = await response.json(); console.info(`Got ${data.prices.length} data points`); if (data && data.prices) { const lastElement = data.prices.pop(); const pricesButLast = data.prices.slice(0, data.prices.length - 1); return { timePrices: pricesButLast, predictTime: lastElement[0], actualPrice: lastElement[1] }; } else { console.log('No price data available.'); return { timePrices: [], predictTime: null, actualPrice: null }; } } catch (error) { console.error('Error fetching data:', error.message); return { timePrices: [], predictTime: null, actualPrice: null }; } } module.exports = fetchPriceData;\n\nThe CoinGecko API is found at api.coingecko.com/api/ . We'll use the market_chart/range endpoint, which lets you define a date range and token ID. The vs_currency parameter specifies what flat currency to use as the scale (in our case, it\u2019s hardcoded to usd ). You can find more information about the CoinGecko API by reading its documentation and introduction. It\u2019s a full-featured API and you can use most of it without an API key.\n\nWe interpolate the arguments sent over from predict.js into the endpoint URL, like so:\n\nhttps://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/${tokenSymbol}/market_chart/range?vs_currency=usd&from=${fromTimestamp}&to=${toTimestamp}\n\nIf you actually plug in some data here, you can open the URL in a browser and get a look at the format; for example, try plugging in:\n\nhttps://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/bitcoin/market_chart/range?vs_currency=usd&from=1684013673.171&to=1691789673.171\n\nNote that the times are in Unix timestamp format.\n\nWe use this URL with the Fetch API, which was integrated into Node in version 14. Then, we navigate the JSON structure to get the actual price list at data.prices . This holds two-dimensional arrays with [timestamp, price] as the structure.\n\nTrain and predict\n\nNext, we do a bit of manipulation that might seem strange, but the idea is to take the last time/price couplet and remove it from the end of the data set. We do this so the AI model can train on the rest of it, and then we can give the model the last timestamp, get a prediction, and compare it to the real price.\n\nOnce we have that, we return an object with three fields holding our data:\n\n{ timePrices: pricesButLast, predictTime: lastElement[0], actualPrice: lastElement[1] }\n\nBack in predict.js , we receive this data and we're ready to call trainAndPredict . It takes the time/price data and a timestamp and returns a value, which is the prediction. Listing 3 has the code for the trainAndPredict module.\n\nListing 3. trainAndPredict\n\nasync function trainAndPredict(timeAndPriceData, newTimestamp) { // Extract timestamps and prices from the data const timestamps = timeAndPriceData.map(([timestamp, price]) => timestamp); const prices = timeAndPriceData.map(([timestamp, price]) => price); // Normalize and scale the data const minTimestamp = Math.min(...timestamps); const maxTimestamp = Math.max(...timestamps); const minPrice = Math.min(...prices); const maxPrice = Math.max(...prices); const normalizedTimestamps = timestamps.map(ts => (ts - minTimestamp) / (maxTimestamp - minTimestamp)); const normalizedPrices = prices.map(price => (price - minPrice) / (maxPrice - minPrice)); // Convert data to TensorFlow tensors const X = tf.tensor1d(normalizedTimestamps); const y = tf.tensor1d(normalizedPrices); // Create a simple linear regression model const model = tf.sequential(); model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, inputShape: [1] })); model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, inputShape: [1] })); model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, inputShape: [1] })); // Compile the model model.compile({ optimizer: 'sgd', loss: 'meanSquaredError' }); // Train the model await model.fit(X, y, { epochs: 100 }); // Normalize the new timestamp for prediction const normalizedNewTimestamp = (newTimestamp - minTimestamp) / (maxTimestamp - minTimestamp); // Predict the normalized price for the new timestamp const normalizedPredictedPrice = model.predict(tf.tensor1d([normalizedNewTimestamp])); // Scale the predicted price back to the original range const predictedPrice = normalizedPredictedPrice.mul(maxPrice - minPrice).add(minPrice); return predictedPrice.dataSync()[0]; } module.exports = trainAndPredict;\n\nListing 3 is where we start to get into the machine learning code. From here forward, it\u2019s helpful to understand basic machine learning concepts.\n\nTraining the model\n\nWe begin by extracting the two data elements, time and price, into separate variables. We then normalize them. Preprocessing data with normalization is common in neural networks. Essentially, we are making sure that both data sets are close to each other in spread. Specifically, we compress the values of both to the range of 0 to 1. This ensures the gradient descent algorithm, which finds the smallest error, works more efficiently and helps it avoid being trapped in local minima.\n\nThe normalization operation for both values consists of finding the maximum and minimum values, subtracting the minimum from the actual value, then dividing by the maximum minus the minimum.\n\nNext, we use the data to create tensors, the basic building block in TensorFlow. Tensors are like vectors on steroids, with n-dimensions. They support complex operations for interactions between the dimensions. TensorFlow lets you model the data as tensors, and then use that data to train your model against. You can learn more about the practical use of tensors in TensorFlow by reading the TensorFlow guide.\n\nIn our case, we only need tame tensors: a couple of one-dimensional vectors for the times and prices. We get these by calling tensor1d() .\n\nWe then create and add layers to the neural network. We use a simple \u201csequential\u201d network, with each layer in a column, and add them with model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, inputShape: [1] })) . Each of these is a layer of neurons in the network. The \u201c dense \u201d designation means that each neuron connects to all the other neurons in the next layer. These are very basic layers, and there is a huge amount of configuration that you can use in TensorFlow, like how many layers, how many neurons, the type of layer (dense, convolution, Long Short-Term Memory, etc.), the activation function, and so on. You can also define custom networks and neuron properties.\n\nNext, we compile the model with the optimizer set to \u201c sgd \u201d (stochastic gradient descent) and the mean square error loss function. Again, this is all open for configuration to help improve the model performance.\n\nRunning the predictor\n\nNow, we are ready to actually run the training with await model.fit(X, y, { epochs: 100 }) , where epochs is the number of cycles to run the data through the network. (Too many epochs can lead to overfitting on the training data.)\n\nFinally, we can make a prediction using the timestamp (which we also normalize), with this call: model.predict(tf.tensor1d([normalizedNewTimestamp])) . To get back to a price, we denormalize the prediction. This is normal JavaScript math, except for the .mul() method, which is part of TensorFlow's support for tensor operations; in this case, element-wise multiplication. In our case, we only have a single predicted value, not an array, so it just performs normal multiplication.\n\nIf we run this code, we'll see something like what's shown in Listing 4.\n\nListing 4. Running the predictor\n\n$ node predict Prediction for Fri Aug 11 2023 21:00:01 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time): 30595.5546875 Actual: 29380.31012784574 $ node predict solana Prediction for Fri Aug 11 2023 22:00:54 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time): 24.18000602722168 Actual: 24.5108586331892\n\nHow did we do?\n\nIn the first case, we get a Bitcoin prediction and in the second, a Solana prediction. Both use the last 90 days of hourly data.\n\nIn both cases, the prediction is in the ballpark, but not terribly accurate. Why is that? The answer is, because there is no real relationship between the timestamps and the prices. That was a very naive and silly approach to predicting Bitcoin prices.\n\nNevertheless, it gave us a good look at all the fundamental components of using TensorFlow with a cryptocurrency API feed. From here, a whole world of possibilities open up.\n\nYou can find the full project code for this demo in my GitHub repo."

        "title": "Why Blackrock Wants High Bitcoin (BTC) Price, SEC\u2013Ripple Lawsuit Cost Ripple (XRP) 3 years of Adoption, an - The Economic Times",
        "content": "In this article, we will explore the reasons why Blackrock is aiming for a higher Bitcoin (BTC) price, how the SEC-Ripple lawsuit has cost Ripple (XRP) three years of adoption, and finally how Tradecurve Markets has experienced a boom in growth over the past few months. Let's look at each of these topics in more detail.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Markets <<\n\nTradecurve Markets (TCRV)\u2019s Stellar Surge: 150% and Rising\n\nAs Tradecurve Markets transitions into its fifth phase, the token price climbed to $0.025, with more than 35 million being acquired in just one week.\n\nSo, what's fueling this excitement? At its core, Tradecurve Markets is an avant-garde trading platform envisioned to meld the benefits of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. By seamlessly integrating the prime features from both trading environments, Tradecurve Markets resonates with a diverse spectrum of traders.\n\nA standout aspect of Tradecurve Markets is its versatile trading palette, enabling transactions across a diverse set of assets. Be it cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities, or corporate stocks, traders can consolidate and oversee their investments on a singular platform.\n\nYet, the real USP of Tradecurve Markets is the removal of cumbersome KYC/AML formalities, empowering traders to embark on their journey with minimal hassle. All it takes is an email registration and an initial cryptocurrency deposit for traders to get started.\n\nGiven these innovative features, it's clear why market analysts are earmarking Tradecurve Markets as a formidable contender against the likes of established giants such as Binance and Kraken. With the road ahead looking bright, there's a palpable sentiment that TCRV's value might soar well beyond the $1.00 mark in due course.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) ETFs and the Market's Jitters\n\nBitcoin has recently slumped from $31,800 to under $26,000 after delays to Bitcoin ETF approvals. Market participants are now commenting that Blackrock wants a lower Bitcoin price before they enter the market.\n\nThe perception that a depressed Bitcoin price would allow BlackRock to rake in higher profits upon the ETF launch may seem logical at first glance. However, diving deeper into the mechanics and implications makes the idea less straightforward.\n\nBlackRock, an esteemed global financial institution, has always prioritized market stability and the trust of its investors. Deliberately benefiting from a significant dip in Bitcoin's value could risk the broader reputation and acceptance of the crypto market.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) keeps a watchful eye on any signs of market manipulation while ensuring robust investor protection. Any suggestion that BlackRock might be involved in manipulating Bitcoin's price would not only tarnish its reputation but could also derail its attempts to secure regulatory green lights for its ETFs.\n\nRecent price action suggests that Bitcoin buyers were overly bullish on the initial ETF news by leveraging margin positions. The subsequent lack of bullish updates caused the price to dip under support, where a long squeeze began.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Markets <<\n\nRipple (XRP)'s Legal Quagmire: Setbacks and Surges\n\nIn a recent statement on X (previously known as Twitter), renowned attorney John Deaton lamented the significant opportunity cost the SEC\u2013Ripple lawsuit had on Ripple (XRP).\n\nThe legal battle has cost Ripple three years of adoption, technology development, and establishing relationships with global partners. Other crypto projects have taken this time to make significant progress in their respective areas, leaving XRP far behind them.\n\nHighlighting the peculiar nature of the lawsuit, Deaton also referenced MoneyGram's association with Ripple. MoneyGram, a global leader in payment processing, had no backlash from the SEC regarding a decision to leverage Ripple.\n\nYet, despite adherence to due diligence and transparency by Ripple's partners, the SEC opted to initiate a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, ushering in an era of uncertainty and setbacks for XRP in the U.S. market.\n\nPrice-wise, the news that Ripple won the SEC case sent the token soaring by over 100% in a single day. However, that full move has fully retraced and Ripple is back trading under the $0.55 support/resistance.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve Markets (TCRV):\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurvemarkets.com/\n\nhttps://app.tradecurvemarkets.com/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis is an advertorial.

        "title": "How Bitcoin is boosting financial inclusion & empowering the unbanked - Business Insider Africa",
        "content": "Many people, especially in developing countries, face many challenges when accessing financial services. Unfortunately, the inability to access financial services and loans hinder them from participating in economic activities. The World Bank's 2017 report indicated that 1.7 billion adults are unbanked globally. These individuals need access to financial services like credit and savings accounts to start and grow businesses.\n\nThis report showed that 56% of the unbanked adults are in China, Bangladesh, Mexico, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, and Nigeria. Limited financial literacy, strict regulations, inadequate infrastructure, and poverty are some of the reasons for financial exclusion. Unfortunately, most unbanked people use risky, expensive, and unreliable financial services.\n\nHow Bitcoin Boosts Financial Inclusion to Empower the Unbanked\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin, they had this notion in mind. They knew that accessing and using financial services reduces poverty while enhancing economic growth. While Bitcoin dominates the crypto world, other digital currencies have emerged. Some are even products of various countries' central banks. For instance, you can invest and try luck in oil trading with online trading apps like Oil Profit. Nevertheless, many see Bitcoin as the beacon of hope for those with limited access to financial services. Here's why.\n\nEasy Access\n\nBitcoin allows individuals to access and use financial services from their mobile devices. To set up a crypto wallet and start receiving Bitcoin, you require a Smartphone that connects to the internet. That way, you can receive Bitcoin payments and transfer them. Also, you can join crypto exchanges to trade Bitcoin for profits.\n\nCurrently, several decentralized finance platforms provide various services to the unbanked. For instance, you can use these platforms to save money and access loans and insurance without the restrictions of traditional banks.\n\nFaster and Low-Cost Transactions\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nConventional financial institutions charge high fees for most transactions, including international remittances. Bitcoin does not require intermediaries because transactions are peer-to-peer, reducing costs significantly. When El Salvador made Bitcoin a legal tender, citizens' remittance costs dropped by 65%. Thus, even small businesses can lower transaction costs by embracing Bitcoin as a payment method.\n\nBesides, Bitcoin transactions are faster because they do not involve intermediaries. Miners validate Bitcoin transactions within minutes. Thus, merchants can receive payments faster and invest funds in their operations by embracing this cryptocurrency.\n\nBorderless Transactions\n\nBitcoin's decentralized network facilitates cross-border transactions without intermediaries. This cryptocurrency enables individuals to transfer and receive funds globally without traditional bank accounts. And this is particularly beneficial for individuals in places with limited conventional banking infrastructure and migrants.\n\nFinancial Empowerment\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto wanted people to enjoy total control over their finances. This cryptocurrency can act as your bank. And you can access it anytime, anywhere. And this is particularly vital for people in places with economic and political instability or limited banking access. Bitcoin enables you to preserve wealth, enjoy financial autonomy, and protect your investment against inflation.\n\nEntrepreneurship Opportunities\n\nThe unbanked population can access the global economy by embracing Bitcoin. This digital currency enables individuals to engage in digital entrepreneurship by fostering the creation and growth of new business models. And this promotes economic growth by creating opportunities that individuals can exploit and boost their livelihoods.\n\nFinal Word\n\nBitcoin is a beacon of hope for the unbanked populations in many countries. It promotes financial inclusion by enabling borderless transactions, enhancing access to financial services, empowering people with financial autonomy, and reducing transaction costs. If the unbanked population embraces Bitcoin, it can exploit the opportunities that Bitcoin presents and achieve economic empowerment by participating in global economic activities. Nevertheless, understanding how this virtual currency works and the economic growth opportunities it presents is vital for unbanked and financially excluded people to benefit from it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n--"

        "content": "Elena is an expert in technical analysis and risk management in cryptocurrency market. She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nThe recent events in the cryptocurrency markets have led to the decline of Bitcoin\u2019s price after reaching a local peak. The market was influenced by a series of positive news that created a euphoric sentiment among investors, such as BlackRock\u2019s ETF application, Ripple\u2019s victory against the SEC, and other developments.\n\nHowever, Mark Yusko, Founder, CEO, and Chief Investment Officer of Morgan Creek Capital, has now answered if this was a natural market cycle or a result of some hidden agenda by insiders who bought earlier and sold at the top. He also talks about the role of BlackRock and other institutions in the market dynamics.\n\nIn an interview with the host of Altcoin Daily, Mark said that what really smart investors have done over the years is they actually go out and short a little bit of the asset and then tell everybody how crappy the asset is in interviews and stuff, and then go buy it when the price goes down.\n\nSo, if you were somebody who was on the verge of being approved for an ETF and you were going to take massive shares and you wanted to buy the asset cheap, you might be contributing to downward pressure in the short run. He thinks that it probably wasn\u2019t BlackRock or others buying that was pushing it up, but rather people.\n\nHe still thinks that BlackRock will be the first one approved. One of the challenges of Bitcoin is that it is pretty closely held, so not much of the total market cap actually changes hands on a day-to-day basis.\n\nMark mentioned that people are getting back to fundamentals and saying that all the selling that was going to happen has happened and all of the liquidations and some leverage happened when they put Binance in the corner."

        "content": "Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction as BCH Breaches $200 Resistance \u2013 Time to Buy?\n\nBitcoin Cash / Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH), the cryptocurrency that powers the Bitcoin Cash layer-1 blockchain that was created back in August 2017 after a hard fork from the original Bitcoin blockchain amid concerns about Bitcoin\u2019s scalability and transaction speed, is trying to get back above the $200 mark.\n\nIt was last changing hands close to $199 and is broadly flat on the day, after finding strong resistance around $210 on Tuesday, when the BCH bulls failed to push the cryptocurrency back to the north of its 100 and 50DMAs and downtrend from the late June high.\n\nBCH has been in a downtrend since a massive pump in June, which was at the time attributed to news that BCH will be one of the few cryptocurrencies listed on by crypto exchange EDX Markets.\n\nEDX Markets, which is backed by a number of major financial institutions like Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Citadel, launched just a few months ago and observers think that the exchange will be looked on more favorably by regulators than its competitors like Coinbase.\n\nPrice Prediction \u2013 Where Next for Bitcoin Cash (BCH)?\n\nBCH\u2019s failure to muster a meaningful break back to the north of the $200 level, as well as above the key aforementioned resistance levels is a concerning sign for the cryptocurrency\u2019s near-term price prospects, and price predictions look set to remain bearish as a result.\n\nIndeed, BCH looks on course to retest recent lows in the $160 area, should the cryptocurrency continue to fail to snap its recent downtrend.\n\nThis is a key support zone, marked by the July 2022 highs and August 2023 lows, while the 200DMA also resides in this area.\n\nIf the bulls were to aggressively buy BCH upon a retest of $160, that would be a strong sign that the bull market ignited back in June remains intact.\n\nIf not, a fallback to the low $100s and back into the late-2022/early-2023 ranges is on the cards.\n\nTime to Buy Bitcoin Cash (BCH)?\n\nGiven the prospect of likely further declines for BCH, crypto investors willing to exercise some patience may want to wait to buy Bitcoin Cash.\n\nAs mentioned above, $160 could be a much better area to get involved, as this could easily mark a near-term price low.\n\nAlternatives to Consider\n\nIt\u2019s always smart for crypto investors to hedge their bets, given the unpredictability of the market.\n\nOne excellent Bitcoin Cash (BCH) alternative that crypto investors should consider is a new coin being launched by Wall Street Memes, one of the internet\u2019s largest retail investing communities.\n\nWall Street Memes, with its over 1 million following across various social media channels, has traditionally described itself as \u201cthe king of stonks\u201d (stocks for the uninitiated), but is also looking to claim the crown of being \u201cthe king of crypto\u201d, with the launch of its very own meme coin token $WSM.\n\nThe presale of $WSM has been a resounding success, with over $25 million raised, and dozens of major crypto industry influencers and analysts backing the coin for major success.\n\nAnd investors are running out of time to get involved, with the presale scheduled to end in under 14 days.\n\nGet in now on a token that could match or even surpass the likes of Pepe Coin, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.\n\nBuy $WSM Here\n\nDisclaimer: Crypto is a high-risk asset class.
