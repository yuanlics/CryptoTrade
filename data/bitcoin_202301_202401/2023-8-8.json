        "title": "SEC Should Reject Bitcoin ETF Filings Because They Will Expose Investors to Fraud, Manipulation, and Other Investor ... - Better Markets",
        "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014Scott Farnin, Legal Counsel, issued the following statement on the filing of Better Markets\u2019 Comment Letters (found here and here) to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in response to multiple proposed rule changes filed by national securities exchanges to list and trade shares in spot bitcoin-based exchange traded products (\u201cETP\u201d):\n\n\u201cThe crypto industry\u2019s track record is clear when it comes to consumers, investors, and financial stability. The industry has suffered $2 trillion in losses; multiple enforcement actions, bankruptcies, and criminal prosecutions; and dozens of lawsuits for lying, cheating, and stealing. Meanwhile, the principal beneficiaries of the crypto craze are the criminals who use it to facilitate ransomware, money laundering, and illegal conduct of all types. It is within this context that the SEC must evaluate latest wave of Bitcoin ETF filings this month.\n\n\u201cFor years the SEC has rightfully rejected multiple attempts by national securities exchanges and sponsors to list and trade shares in spot bitcoin-based ETPs. Our comment letters urge the SEC to remain consistent with its previous orders disapproving such filings and reject the eight proposed rule changes pending before the agency.\n\n\u201cThe Exchange Act is explicit in providing that any proposed changes to national securities exchange rules must be designed to \u2018prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices\u2019 and \u2018to protect investors and the public interest.\u2019 The proposed rule changes at issue, which would enable the listing and trading of shares in spot bitcoin-based ETPs, fail to meet those statutory requirements and must be rejected.\n\n\u201cThe spot bitcoin markets (1) have a history of artificially inflated trading volumes due to rampant manipulation and wash trading; (2) are highly concentrated; and (3) rely on a select group of individuals and entities to maintain bitcoin\u2019s network. These are features of the bitcoin network that make a proposed spot bitcoin-based ETP extremely vulnerable to manipulation by bad actors, posing unnecessary risks to investors and the public interest. The proposed rule changes offer little to neutralize these threats. Their reliance on the surveillance of other markets to detect and address manipulation is wholly inadequate. For example, the CME bitcoin futures market is not a regulated market of significant size, and the surveillance-sharing agreements with Coinbase would add little or no value in detecting and deterring manipulation of any proposed spot bitcoin-based ETP. Products that pose such clear threats to investors and fail to comply with the core requirements of the law must be rejected.\u201d\n\nRead our full comment letters here and here.\n\n###\n\nBetter Markets is a non-profit, non-partisan, and independent organization founded in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to promote the public interest in the financial markets, support the financial reform of Wall Street and make our financial system work for all Americans again. Better Markets works with allies\u2014including many in finance\u2014to promote pro-market, pro-business and pro-growth policies that help build a stronger, safer financial system that protects and promotes Americans\u2019 jobs, savings, retirements and more.

        "title": "Bitcoin Isn't Going Away, Says David Rubenstein - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nThis is perfectly timed because Novogratz has been the pinata of Bitcoin when it goes down. It's been the genius of Bitcoin when it goes up and all of a sudden Larry showed up at the door to say, Hey, big, respectable firms can prosecute and do Bitcoin. Link Lawrence Fink of BlackRock to Mike Novogratz. Well, what's happened is people, as you suggest, make fun of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But now the establishment of Larry Fink at BlackRock is now saying they're going to have an ETF if approved by the government in Bitcoin. So you're saying, wait a second, the mighty BlackRock is willing to have an ETF in Bitcoin. Maybe Bitcoin is going to be around for a while. Lisa wants to jump in here, but I'm going to cut to the news moment. Is Carlyle announcing this morning a Bitcoin advocacy? No, I don't think so. But there's no doubt that Bitcoin is something that I wish I had bought it at $100 a bitcoin when Mike Novogratz started buying, it's now at $29,000. So he's made a lot of money and a lot of people who bought it at $100 or less are feeling pretty good now. It went up as high as 61,000, I think even down to 31,000 or even 29,000. Now, there's still a pretty good profit if you're bought in 100. We all wish we would have bought it at 100 and to write it up. It's one thing for BlackRock to come up with an ETF because they believe the proposition of Bitcoin. It's another because they see a profitability proposition where they can, you know, basically take advantage of the interest other people have. I mean, isn't that more of what this is that basically Wall Street is saying if there is a market for it and we can viably make one for them and make some money, why not? Well, remember, Wall Street is in business to make money and this is something they can probably make money off. You have to remember, the United States government has been somewhat skeptical of it. I think Democrats in the Congress and particularly the people regulating the FCC are skeptical of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But outside the United States, there's a lot of interest in it. I think FCX really hurt when it went bankrupt and it hurt the the crypto industry. But a lot of people around the world want to be able to trade in a currency that their government can't know what they have and they want to be at a moving around, rightly or wrongly. And so I don't think Bitcoin is going away. I think the Republicans on Capitol Hill have been pretty supportive of it. There's a difference between having a seamless cross-currency payment, basically saying that instead of going to Western Union, I can go and just transfer something in Bitcoin if it has a stable enough price. That's one proposition. But the proposition of Bitcoin as a store of value, that could kind of be bid up the way that gold or silver could seems to have been sparked with the advent of yield suddenly that you can get for actual money. I mean, isn't that sort of the feeling that you're getting? Well, there's no doubt that when when interest rates are as high as they are, you don't need to have gold or other kinds of things to get you some solid return, because when you get 5% on Treasuries, but eventually 5% will be coming down at some point. I don't think Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies that are the better ones, the better known ones, Bitcoin. And so a number of others are going to go away. There's enormous interest around the world in being able to have something you can transfer without the government knowing about it and keep it private. And you know, you can say, well, people shouldn't do that, but that's not going to stop people from doing it. Mr. Novogratz And Mr. Gensler, what did he say about the efforts of our chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who's the chairman of the SEC, is not a big fan of cryptocurrencies. I think that's fair to say. But he lost a major case recently in court where he was trying to argue that one of the cryptocurrencies ripple was was a security and he lost that case. So I think the SEC has not been able to convince these the government yet, or at least the courts that cryptocurrency is such a dangerous thing. And I remember a lot of people in the government now are thinking that Gary Gensler won't be the chairman of the SEC for ever going to go. I mean, these guys just wait them out, right? I think that's a strategy that's very popular in Washington, waiting out regulators who don't like."

        "content": "The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization briefly shot past $30,000 Tuesday evening, a sudden moment of volatility for Bitcoin in a month of comparative steadiness.\n\nThe token reached a high of $30,177 at about 5 p.m. ET before quickly falling to just above $29,800. The cryptocurrency is now trading at a similar mark after briefly jumping to $30,043. In the past week, Bitcoin is up nearly 2%.\n\nThe almost $1.2 trillion market for cryptocurrencies\u2014of which Bitcoin constitutes almost half\u2014is also up, about 1%, in the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. Crypto prices are not in line with the broader stock market, as the S&P 500 is down nearly 2% and the Nasdaq almost 3% in the same time frame.\n\n\u201cThe rise in Bitcoin price so far is only about 3% off of recent lows,\u201d Chris Bendiksen, Bitcoin research lead at CoinShares, told Fortune in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s well within its historic daily volatility profile, so it shouldn\u2019t really warrant much excitement.\u201d\n\nFollowing lows of almost $16,000 to start the year, the price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market cap has almost doubled after a disastrous 2022.\n\nIn the beginning of June, when Bitcoin was trading near $27,000, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued both Binance and Coinbase, two of the largest exchanges, and the broader crypto market tumbled, with Bitcoin nearly touching $25,000.\n\nHowever, just days later, BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, filed an application for a Bitcoin spot ETF, or a way for more traditional investors to gain exposure to the daily price swings of the cryptocurrency. Soon after, a flood of other firms filed applications for their own Bitcoin spot ETFs, and the price of the cryptocurrency soared to a year high of over $31,000.\n\nBitcoin hasn\u2019t pushed past that high-water mark since, but it has plateaued in a surprising bout of stability for a usually volatile asset.\n\n\u201cIn order to rekindle proper excitement in the markets,\u201d CoinShares\u2019 Bendiksen added, \u201cI believe we need to see a convincing breakout above $32,000, followed by a prolonged period of price holding above those levels.\u201d"

        "content": "MicroStrategy now owns roughly 0.75% of bitcoins in circulation and has shown no intention of slowing down its purchases.\n\nThe company\u2019s bitcoin (BTC) buy-and-hold strategy isn\u2019t exactly risk-free, one analyst said \u2014 though another industry watcher said the company is likely to only stop, and perhaps sell, if absolutely necessary.\n\nMicroStrategy owns 152,800 BTC \u2014 bought for $4.53 billion, or $29,672 per bitcoin. Its holdings have steadily ticked upwards, with the company buying in bull and bear markets alike.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to stop,\u201d said Lance Vitanza, managing director of equity research at TD Cowen.\n\nThe company did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nNo end in sight\n\nThe business intelligence software company run by bitcoin bull Michael Saylor kicked off its bitcoin acquisition strategy in August 2020.\n\nIt more recently bought 12,333 BTC for $347 million between April 29 and June 27 \u2014 its largest acquisition since June 2021. It then added 467 BTC to its stash in July.\n\nExecutives have been clear on earnings calls that the company plans to continue accumulating BTC over time using excess cash and net proceeds of capital markets transactions, including issuing convertible notes.\n\nMatthew Weller, global head of research at StoneX, said the company has become well-known for its \u201chybrid corporate strategy\u201d of converting profits from its core software intelligence business into BTC \u2014 an asset it views as a superior store of value.\n\n\u201cHaving already gone so far along this path, it\u2019s hard to see MicroStrategy stopping its bitcoin buying spree with any excess cash the operating company generates,\u201d Weller told Blockworks.\n\nVitanza said he expects the firm to limit buys to when market conditions are attractive \u2014 based upon the price of BTC and the price at which MicroStrategy can issue securities, either debt or equity.\n\nThe firm\u2019s stock price was $377.84 through Wednesday\u2019s close \u2014 up 160% on the year. The price of BTC was $29,390 at that time, a 77% increase from the start of 2023.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s bitcoin buys are very much dependent on the relationship between those both prices, Vitanza argued.\n\n\u201cI am confident that the company has a model that is very specific and that has that algorithm plugged in.\u201d Vitanza said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though they\u2019re just sitting there waking up in the morning saying, \u2018Hey, you know what, the stock\u2019s at $390 and bitcoin\u2019s at $30,000\u2019 \u2014 it feels like a good mix.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy indicated in an August 1 filing that it had entered into a sales agreement with Cowen and Company, Canaccord Genuity and Berenberg Capital Markets to sell up to $750 million of stock with one or more of those entities.\n\nOn an earning call last week, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang said MicroStrategy could use the proceeds for \u201cgeneral corporate purposes,\u201d including to buy more bitcoin, or to repurchase or repay its outstanding debt.\n\nKang noted the company terminated its prior $625 million at-the-market (ATM) equity offering \u2014 of which about $290 million of capacity remained \u2014 to replace it with the $750 million facility.\n\n\u201cThey looked at it and said $290 million isn\u2019t enough, so that tells us something,\u201d Vitanze said. \u201cI would have expected that they would have continued to use the old facility until it was closer to zero. But the fact that they [wanted] to blow this thing up to a bigger size makes me think they are buying in the near term, or they were.\u201d\n\nBerenberg Capital Markets analysts said in an August 1 research note that they expect MicroStrategy to hold 156,800 BTC \u2014 4,000 BTC more than it does now \u2014 by April 2024.\n\nWhat are the risks, and when could they sell?\n\nMicroStrategy is not buying bitcoin based on six month price projections, Vitanza said.\n\nThe strategy, rather, he said, is based on the idea that over many years bitcoin will become an increasingly accepted form of money while fiat currencies continue to devalue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they will sell it just to recognize gain,\u201d Vitanza said. \u201cBecause what are they going to do with the money? They\u2019re going to put it into a fiat currency, which is then going to be devalued at 10% per year.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy would only sell bitcoin if they are in need of operational capital, to pay taxes or pay off dollar-denominated debt, the TD Cowen research managing director said. The company\u2019s outstanding debt and convertible notes amount to $2.2 billion.\n\nAbout half of that is set to come due as early as 2025, Vitanza said.\n\n\u201cIf the financing markets are awful and the company has no cash, then they might be in a position that they\u2019re forced to sell bitcoin to generate the dollars that they need to pay off their debt,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s unlikely, in my opinion, but I think that\u2019s kind of the only scenario.\u201d\n\nIn terms of risks for MicroStrategy, buying too much bitcoin is not one of them, Vitanza said. But buying bitcoin in a way that investors don\u2019t deem prudent could cause some to look to other vehicles to gain bitcoin exposure.\n\nRead more: MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin Buy Draws Criticism\n\nAnother such way could be via a spot bitcoin ETF \u2014 a product the Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet allowed to come to market, but that some believe could launch in the coming months after filings by BlackRock, Fidelity and others.\n\nWeller said the prospect of such a fund hitting the market after about a decade of attempts from a range of issuers could pose a \u201cbig risk\u201d for MicroStrategy.\n\n\u201cMany investors buy MicroStrategy stock as a widely available proxy to get exposure to Bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if a simple, low-fee alternative emerges, much of the current demand for the stock may dry up, leaving the highly-valued, slow-growing operating company to manage an unwieldy volatile balance sheet.\u201d\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF, if approved, \u201cwon\u2019t offer the same kind of leverage yield that MicroStrategy offers,\u201d Saylor said during the company\u2019s August 1 earnings call.\n\nA portion of institutional investors, however, will opt for a bitcoin ETF to get involved in the space, he acknowledged.\n\n\u201cMicroStrategy wouldn\u2019t be the right option for them because they really just need to be able to buy an unlimited amount of bitcoin, without worrying about not tracking the bitcoin price and with clarity and transparency,\u201d Saylor said. \u201cSo I think that will expand the pie\u2026and MicroStrategy is going to continue to be thoughtful and responsible about managing our business in order to find ways to get incremental bitcoin for our investors.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Retrieve Bitcoin and Ethereum Public Blockchain Data with Amazon Managed Blockchain Query | Amazon Web Services - AWS Blog",
        "content": "Over the past two years, public blockchain adoption has been driven by three primary use cases:\n\ndecentralized finance (DeFi), which provides an open financial system built using smart contracts on public blockchains\n\nnon-fungible tokens (NFTs) that certify ownership of digital assets and enable broad transferability of those digital assets\n\ndigital currency payments that enable value transfer without intermediate institutions\n\nIn addition to the adoption driven by the early Web3 innovators, regulated enterprises are also increasing their use of public blockchains. For example, financial institutions such as Ita\u00fa Bank and Fidelity are entering into the cryptocurrency space as trusted, regulated custodians and exchanges. Other institutions, such as Nasdaq, are enabling cryptocurrency for traditional finance as technology providers. Media companies such as Warner Music Group and consumer companies such as Nike continue to incorporate NFTs into their event ticketing and loyalty programs. Payment processors such as Visa and Mastercard are offering cryptocurrency debit cards and solutions for merchants.\n\nHowever, the growing adoption has also highlighted one of the growing challenges of building with blockchain, which is data. The immutability of blockchain transactions, a strength of the technology, means that the data can only grow with time. And although this data is stored publicly and can be accessed by everyone, transforming this information into a performant and accurate format that can be accessed efficiently at scale by applications is a challenge for many customers.\n\nIn this post, we describe the general challenges of working with blockchain data and introduce how Amazon Managed Blockchain Query, a feature of Amazon Managed Blockchain, can help you access blockchain data quickly so you can focus on building differentiators for the mainstream businesses and consumers.\n\nChallenges of blockchain data\n\nAt a high level, the challenges of preparing blockchain data is similar to many other big data problems: complicated ETL (extract, transform, and load) processes, disparate sources of information, and expensive storage.\n\nFirst, the method in which blockchain data is stored poses challenges for application use. Blockchain data is essentially stored as a ledger of state transformations between each block. That is, the information captures what changed from block n to block n+1, such as balance changes in addresses or new smart contracts being deployed. This structure, although well-suited for ensuring data integrity and security on a decentralized network, isn\u2019t ideally suited for tasks like data analysis or developing applications that need to run complex queries. There are no simple data views that can serve commonly requested data in a performant manner that application builders are used to. Take for example a wallet developer, who needs to load the historical wallet balance of a user in seconds. To run the queries efficiently, they would first need to download the entire blockchain ledger (which could be several hundreds of gigabytes in size and requires connecting to blockchain nodes) from multiple blockchains such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon. Following this, the data would need to be indexed in a database system that allows efficient queries\u2014a task that presents a significant computational challenge, especially when dealing with larger blockchains.\n\nSecond, in order to provide real-time data, developers have to adapt their system for blockchain finality, which is the assurance that that past transactions can never change. Because blockchains are global and decentralized, it takes a certain time (or number of blocks) for the network to reach an agreement, or consensus, about the blockchain\u2019s legitimate state. During this time, which could range from minutes to hours, data received by a blockchain node may be replaced by another dataset that is recognized by the network as legitimate. In busy times with many transactions being submitted to different nodes, blockchains may revert transactions from multiple blocks. This characteristic of eventual finality is challenging for developers because in such cases, they have to correct the data they have already processed and calculated (such as balances), while still keeping up to date with the streaming information from the blockchain. This also causes problems in situations demanding real-time data for decision-making processes. Take for example a financial application interacting with public blockchains. A high-value trade could potentially be run based on a confirmed transaction in the system. However, this transaction could be later reversed if the network acknowledges another chain as the true one. The financial implications of such a reversal could be significant, demonstrating the inherent risk and complexity associated with streaming real-time data from the blockchain.\n\nThird, developers must assimilate data from multiple sources to construct a complete picture of transactions and interactions in a manner that is easy for humans to understand. With applications now expected to be deployed across multiple blockchains, developers have to process information from different blockchains with potentially different standards. Data stored on the blockchain includes critical information such as the from address, to address, transaction amount, and address of the token smart contract. Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum both store data in completely different structures, and as such, developers who wish to access data from these blockchains must navigate these differences in data structure and JSON-RPC API options to extract that data in a usable manner.\n\nFourth, developers sometimes have to rerun smart contracts to understand the fine-grained details of their operations. This is one of the most resource-intensive challenges when working with blockchain data. Smart contracts are self-running contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. However, the current flexibility in how different smart contract developers code their functions and emit events on the blockchain makes tracking vital information such as balances or transaction details an arduous task. To interact with the distributed applications on the blockchain, such as decentralized lending platforms or decentralized exchanges, transactions often involve calling multiple smart contracts. Smart contracts often interact with each other and their behavior can vary based on the blockchain\u2019s state. Consequently, obtaining an accurate understanding of what a smart contract was doing at a specific point in time often entails recreating the entire state of the blockchain at that moment and tracing the transactions. For example, consider a music artist offers a token-gated event where only holders of that artist\u2019s Non-Fungible Token (NFT) collection on a given date would be admitted to a live concert. To verify the exact conditions under which an individual may be granted access to the event \u2014such as the token balance of a given user\u2019s wallet at a historical point in time or the exact NFT that user owned\u2014a developer might have to recreate the entire state of the blockchain at a given time to determine who should and should not be granted access to the event, depending on smart contract design. This process is computationally expensive and time-consuming, presenting considerable challenges in terms of efficiency and scalability.\n\nAMB Query \u2013 Key Features\n\nIn this section, we discuss key features of Managed Blockchain Query and how it supports builders\u2019 blockchain data needs.\n\nCost-efficient public blockchain data\n\nManaged Blockchain Query provides standardized APIs to retrieve blockchain data from multiple public blockchains, starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum, without requiring you to provision or manage infrastructure for blockchain nodes nor maintain indexing infrastructure to extract, transform, and load blockchain data for use in your applications. Managed Blockchain Query APIs offer predictable pricing by allowing you to pay only for the API requests you make, paying per million requests based on pricing buckets that are priced according to the compute and data resources required to render the result for the API request.\n\nTo illustrate the cost-efficiency of Managed Blockchain Query, imagine you operate a custodial digital asset wallet that interacts with the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Imagine the monthly demand for this wallet requires 20 million requests for token balances for user addresses on Bitcoin and .5 million requests to get transaction events (for example, transaction inputs and outputs) for Bitcoin. Additionally, the wallet must accommodate 5 million requests for token balances for Ethereum assets and 2.5 million requests for Ethereum transaction events. The cost for this request traffic is calculated in the following table (in the us-east-1 Region).\n\nReliable and highly available\n\nWith REST APIs available in the supported Regions backed by robust data indexing infrastructure and ETL pipelines, Managed Blockchain Query provides reliable and highly available access to public blockchain data across multiple chains. Managed Blockchain Query follows the AWS high standard for reliability, so you can build your application to use Managed Blockchain Query with confidence. Furthermore, you no longer have to guess about capacity, because Managed Blockchain Query APIs scale with your request volume to service your requests at subsecond latency. Managed Blockchain Query also provides high availability, and you can expect 99.9% availability from the service.\n\nRegardless of whether you are building a proof of concept or a high-scale production workload, Managed Blockchain Query can support your blockchain data query needs.\n\nAccelerate development of Web3 applications with developer-friendly REST APIs\n\nManaged Blockchain Query offers APIs that reduce the time and complexity involved in rendering public blockchain data insights to your applications and your users. For example, with a single API call, you can retrieve a list of transactions sent and received from a given wallet address on Ethereum, which makes it easy to populate a user interface with historical transaction details. Furthermore, you can use Managed Blockchain Query to get the current finalized and historical balance for native coins (such as ETH and BTC) and non-native tokens (such as ERC20) with subsecond latency. You can use this API to retrieve individual tokens as well as to retrieve a full list of token balances for a given wallet address. Managed Blockchain Query APIs make common blockchain data insights readily available to developers to use within a myriad of applications, such as web and mobile wallets, analytics pipelines, trading applications, and more, helping developers with dependencies on blockchain data launch products faster.\n\nUse cases for Managed Blockchain Query\n\nManaged Blockchain Query delivers common public blockchain data in a simple way to developers, without requiring custom data indexing and query infrastructure. For example, imagine a digital wallet that needs to display a list of historical transactions and current balances for Ethereum tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 and native Ether (ETH). With Managed Blockchain Query APIs, this data is available with a simple REST API call. You can learn more about each API in the Managed Blockchain Query collection in Managed Blockchain Query Developer Guide.\n\nIn this section, we discuss a variety of lower-level use cases that Managed Blockchain Query APIs can address.\n\nQuery current and historical token balances on public blockchains\n\nThe GetTokenBalance API provides a way to get the balance of native coins (ETH, BTC) and various tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155), which can be used to get the current balance of an externally owned account (EOA) or a historical balance using a universal timestamp (Unix timestamp, in seconds). For example, you can use the GetTokenBalance API to get an address\u2019s balance of an ERC20 token, USDC, on the Ethereum mainnet. You can also retrieve balances of tokens in a batch by providing a list of coins or tokens for which to get balances using the BatchGetTokenBalance API.\n\nRetrieve historical transaction data for a given address\n\nWith Managed Blockchain Query, you can easily retrieve historical data from public blockchains such as Ethereum. This enables several use cases, like populating transaction history on a mobile or desktop crypto wallet or providing contextual information about a transaction based on its transaction hash. In this example, you can use the ListTransactions and GetTransaction APIs to first get a list of all transactions for a given externally owned address (EOA) on the Ethereum mainnet, and then retrieve transaction details for a single transaction in the list.\n\nGet all token balances for a given address\n\nThe ListTokenBalances API is a powerful tool for wallets, user interfaces, Web3 utilities, and more, because it returns a list of all balances for an address across both tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) and native coins (ETH, BTC) on a given public blockchain in a single API call. In this example, you can provide an EOA and a network on the Ethereum mainnet, and receive a list of token and native coin balances on Ethereum in the response.\n\nGet all tokens minted by a smart contract\n\nThe ListTokenBalances API can also return a list of all tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) minted by a smart contract when passed the smart contract address as input. For example, you can retrieve information related to NFTs minted by an ERC721 smart contract on Ethereum in a single API call.\n\nList events emitted by a given transaction\n\nThe ListTransactionEvents API allows you to retrieve a list of smart contract standard events that are emitted as a result of a given transaction, identified by its hash (transaction identifier). For example, you can use ListTransactionEvents to inspect the resulting events of a transaction that calls a function of an ERC20 token smart contract on Ethereum, such as a Transfer event.\n\nUsing AMB Query in the AWS Management Console\n\nThe AWS Management Console experience for Amazon Managed Blockchain Query offers a graphical user interface query editor that allows you to test Query APIs straight from your browser via your AWS account. To illustrate how to use the query editor, this example details how to use the ListTransactions API to retrieve a full list of transactions an EOA has been party to.\n\nNavigate to the AWS Management Console and sign into your AWS account. Then navigate to the Amazon Managed Blockchain service using the search bar and select the \u201cQuery public blockchains\u201d radio button on the right-hand side of the screen. Finally, select \u201cLaunch AMB Query\u201d.\n\nOnce on the query editor page, you must select between the Bitcoin network or Ethereum mainnet as the target for your query. For this example, select \u201cETHERUM_MAINNET\u201d from the \u201cBlockchain network\u201d dropdown.\n\nThen, select the AMB Query API you wish to run from the \u201cQuery type\u201d dropdown, which in this case will be \u201cListTokenBalances\u201d.\n\nThen, fill in both required and/or optional query parameters to finalize your request for blockchain data. In this example, provide an Ethereum externally owned account (EOA) address and any filters by date/time that are relevant.\n\nAfter adding all necessary details to your request, select \u201cRun query\u201d to receive results for your request. If no results are returned, verify that you are using an EOA that has transactions occurring within any date/time filters you have set for your request.\n\nYou may use the AMB Query editor in the AWS Management Console to test all supported AMB Query APIs and explore the Bitcoin and Ethereum data these APIs offer. AMB Query is a pay-as-you-go service billed based on your usage of APIs, thus no resources have been provisioned in your account as part of this hands-on example that need to be deleted.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this post, we addressed the common challenges builders face when working with blockchain data, as well as how Managed Blockchain Query can address many of those challenges.

        "content": "Kentucky\u2019s utility regulator has approved more than $4 million in electricity cost discounts over several years for a Bitcoin mining operation being run by Kentucky\u2019s largest coal producer.\n\nThe Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) in its Monday order said the economic development incentives offered by Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities (LG&E and KU) to Bitiki-KY, a Bitcoin mining subsidiary of coal company Alliance Resource Partners, would be unlikely to harm LG&E and KU\u2019s ratepayers, and the costs of the discounts would likely be covered.\n\nThe commission opened a case last year investigating the reasonableness of the electricity discounts, known as an economic development rider, given to Bitiki-KY and two other cryptocurrency mining operations after environmental and renewable advocacy organizations raised concerns about the incentives.\n\nThe groups \u2014 including Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, Kentucky Solar Energy Society and the Kentucky Resources Council \u2014 questioned whether the jobs created by cryptocurrency mining were worth the discounts and whether the discounts should be saved for other industries that employ more Kentuckians.\n\nAlliance promised to create five jobs and invest $25 million as part of the agreement for the discounts. During a commission hearing, one LG&E and KU employee said the utility didn\u2019t have a way to ensure employees aren\u2019t being double-counted from another part of Alliance\u2019s business.\n\nAlliance is operating high-powered computers on top of a former coal mine in Union County, not far from the sprawling coal company\u2019s largest underground mine that produced more than 10 million tons of coal in 2022. Alliance\u2019s CEO is Joseph Craft III, whose wife Kelly Craft lost an expensive race to become the Republican nominee for governor earlier this year.\n\nMining cryptocurrency requires immense amounts of electricity to power high-capacity computers that perform complicated mathematical calculations, securing online transactions of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Mining operations are compensated for solving the calculations with Bitcoin itself, valued at nearly $30,000 as of early August.\n\nThe environmental and renewable energy groups argued before the commission that LG&E and KU had not provided evidence of job creation by Alliance through its Bitcoin mining operation, nor had LG&E and KU offered evidence Alliance would have relocated its operation without the discounts.\n\nIn its Monday order, the commission said LG&E and KU is not required under existing state regulations \u201cto demonstrate minimum levels of investment or job creation\u201d as a part of the economic development incentives.\n\n\u201cBitiki has asserted that it plans to make $25 million in capital investments and its project will create five jobs,\u201d the commission order stated. \u201cThe Commission has no reason to doubt the veracity of Bitiki\u2019s assertions.\u201d\n\nLG&E and KU spokesperson Natasha Collins said the utility was \u201cpleased\u201d with the commission\u2019s decision to approve the discounts and that it determines whether to offer economic development incentives based on, in part, if a company also receives incentives from state government. Bitiki-KY in March 2022 received $250,000 in tax benefits from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority.\n\n\u201cThis helps ensure that our EDR candidates have bona fide economic development projects in the view of the Commonwealth. We rely on that vetting process as well as the plausible representations of prospective EDR customers with regard to potential job creation,\u201d Collins said.\n\nAlliance did not respond to a request for comment on the order.\n\nThom Cmar, a senior attorney for Earthjustice representing the environmental and renewable energy groups in the PSC case, said the groups were \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the commission\u2019s decision to approve the discounts. He also said the regulator\u2019s order didn\u2019t address the fact that Alliance was operating its Bitcoin mining operation with the electricity discounts suspended during the commission\u2019s investigation.\n\n\u201cIf the company in particular is already operating without those discounts, there really ought to be compelling evidence in the record as to why they need them,\u201d Cmar said. \u201cKentucky Utilities did not attempt to provide that type of evidence, and the commission made a judgment that it wasn\u2019t necessary to dig into that issue.\u201d\n\nAn LG&E and KU employee said in past commission testimony that the Bitcoin mining operation\u2019s electricity usage hinged on receiving the discounts: Alliance would likely not increase its power usage at its Bitcoin mining site from 10 megawatts to 13 megawatts without the discounts.\n\nCmar said he hopes the commission in separate investigations it is conducting will deny economic development incentives given by utility Kentucky Power to two other cryptocurrency mining operations. One of those operations would likely be the state\u2019s largest cryptocurrency mining facility and have the capacity to use up to 250 megawatts of electricity.\n\n\u201cWe just think it\u2019s important that the commission give all of these contracts close scrutiny and make sure that these economic development discounts are being used for actual meaningful economic development, and [we] don\u2019t believe that the cryptocurrency facilities for which they\u2019ve been proposed are providing that,\u201d Cmar said."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether fell during Tuesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, along with most of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Long term investors continue accumulating Bitcoin, despite the asset\u2019s recent price action, industry experts told Forkast.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin plunges under US$30,000 amid market turbulence. Is US$27,000 next?\n\nDogecoin leads declines across most top 10 cryptos\n\nBitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, trading at US$29,161 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after it fell below the US$30,000 support level on July 24. Despite struggling to rally higher in recent weeks, industry experts say that Bitcoin\u2019s accumulation remains robust among long-term holders.\n\n\u201cWhat we see today is very similar to this stage of previous cycles \u2013 an absence of speculative activity and intense accumulation with coins moving to high conviction, sticky hands \u2013 with more in cold storage than ever before,\u201d wrote Jamie Coutts, a senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, to Forkast.\n\n\u201cThe metrics we track that encapsulate asset-accumulation behavior have never been more robust. Nearly 75% of the issued supply is held in wallets where the coins haven\u2019t moved for more than six months. And for the first time, there are now over 1 million \u201cwhole Bitcoiners\u201d \u2013 people owning at least 1 full BTC.\u201d\n\nIn the crypto market, Ether rose 0.21% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,828 and declined 0.36% during the past week.\n\nDogecoin was the day\u2019s biggest loser in the top 10, after it fell 1.54% in the past 24 hours to US$0.07352, followed by Polkadot\u2019s DOT token that declined 0.57% to US$4.96.\n\nLeading the winners, the XRP coin rose 1.05% to US$0.6203, followed by Solana\u2019s SOL token that gained 0.68% to US$23.24\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 0.21% to US$1.16 trillion while market volume increased 42.48% to US$32.32 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nStory continues\n\nPayPal\u2019s stablecoin lifts NFT sales on Ethereum, top NFT blockchains\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.69% to 2,476.83 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 1.3% during the week.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales continued yesterday\u2019s decline, falling 14.92% to US$365,955 with the network slipping to the eighth largest blockchain by 24-hour NFT sales volume, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales recovered after yesterday\u2019s slump, rising 19.43% to US$8.05 million, while sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, declined 10.40% to US$563,891. Its twin collection, the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, rose 26.24% to US$630,187, becoming the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection by 24-hour sales volume.\n\n\u201cA rare day in the green with sales volume across most blockchains up double-digit percentages. Bitcoin however is still struggling,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cPaypal announcing the launch of a stablecoin has excited the NFT market a bit, as they look forward to an easy way to onboard the masses to crypto.\u201d\n\nPaypal launched the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin on Monday. The Ethereum-based token is issued by Paxos Trust Company \u2013 the U.S.-based issuer of Binance\u2019s BUSD stablecoin \u2013 and is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. treasuries and similar cash equivalents.\n\nAmong the Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast SOL NFT Composite and the Forkast POL NFT Composite were the only ones in the green for the day.\n\nAsian equities, U.S. stock futures fall as investors await key U.S. inflation data\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities declined as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, except Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 that rose for a second consecutive day. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all posted declines.\n\nInvestor appetite remained subdued, after China\u2019s trade figures showed that exports from the country fell by 14.5% in July, the biggest fall since the beginning of the pandemic. Imports also dropped at the highest pace since January.\n\nDespite yesterday\u2019s strong session, U.S. stock futures fell during Tuesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures all declining.\n\nTraders remained cautious ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data for July, scheduled for Thursday, as this can also signal the path for further interest rate decisions.\n\nOn the corporate front, investors are now anticipating earnings from companies like UPS, Zoetis and Duke Energy Corporation.\n\nEuropean equities fell on Tuesday, extending Monday\u2019s decline, with the Dax losing 0.9% and the pan-European Stoxx 600 index falling 0.71%, as markets lacked notable catalysts.\n\nSee related article: Standard Chartered\u2019s great expectations for Bitcoin in 2024\n\nUpdates with equities section"

        "content": "The launch of PayPal\u2019s stablecoin \u2014 PYUSD \u2014 is the biggest crypto news in 2023, more significant than news about any future bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nPayPal has always been an early crypto adopter relative to their banking and fintech peer group. In September 2020, they helped initiate the bull cycle by being the first large fintech to allow their millions of users to buy crypto.\n\nPayPal\u2019s entry into crypto helped legitimize it as an asset class and changed the agenda of board meetings globally \u2014 directors started asking CEOs \u201cwhat is your crypto strategy?\u201d and companies rushed to develop slide decks, partnerships and a broad suite of products: The impact could be felt globally from Mexico to Brazil and beyond.\n\nChad Cascarilla, the CEO of Paxos, summarized the industry sentiment well \u2014 \u201cBefore they were afraid to be first, now they\u2019re afraid to be left behind.\u201d\n\nPYUSD is a similar watershed moment for the industry, coming at a critical time when stablecoin volume outstanding is increasingly moving to offshore options such as USDT.\n\nPayPal entering the crypto space adds legitimacy to stablecoins and paves the way for additional companies to incorporate regulated stablecoins into their platforms or launch their own.\n\nBack to the headline \u2014 why is this bigger news than the bitcoin ETF?\n\nThrough PYUSD, PayPal is on a journey to onboard millions of people to crypto and public blockchains, while a bitcoin ETF would instead ultimately lock users into the traditional financial system. PYUSD can be sent to public Ethereum addresses 24/7/365, as opposed to ETF products that would trade only during market hours.\n\nTo be clear, the bitcoin ETF is a great milestone for our industry. But it ultimately comes with the same legacy challenges of a closed system \u2014 consumers still need accounts issued by intermediaries to access the ETF and need to pay recurring fees to hold the asset. A bitcoin ETF would enable a greater swath of the traditional financial system to gain price exposure to bitcoin, but it still does not help make public blockchains universally useful or accessible.\n\nPYUSD, however, increases both utility and accessibility, enabling anyone globally (across borders) to permissionlessly access and use trusted US dollars in legacy and novel financial products. It also further legitimizes public blockchains as reliable platforms for value exchange and innovation.\n\nWhy would Paypal launch a stablecoin?\n\nThe first reason for PayPal to launch a stablecoin is to capture payments that would otherwise be completed through other channels.\n\nA major challenge of closed loop payment systems is that they require both sender and receiver to have accounts. PYUSD, however, enables an open loop system \u2014 it\u2019s possible to use this stablecoin without even having a PayPal account at all.\n\nSaid differently, the advent of a PayPal stablecoin makes a user\u2019s PayPal balance more universally useful.\n\nIf a consumer wants to pay with PayPal but the merchant doesn\u2019t have a PayPal account, the merchant can simply provide a blockchain address and the PayPal app could issue a PYUSD withdrawal to immediately settle the transaction. Without an open system, the transaction would have been completed through a different payment channel or not completed at all.\n\nSecond, PayPal is uniquely positioned to solve the massive opportunity of fiat onboarding \u2014 they have the banking relationships, regulatory framework and infrastructure to onboard millions of dollars to millions of wallets.\n\nRead more: Why the PayPal stablecoin could be different than Meta\u2019s diem\n\nSeamless fiat on/off boarding is still a largely unsolved but important unlock for the crypto ecosystem, and a key opportunity for brands like PayPal to build recurring relationships with customers. And critically, by both being a fiat on-ramp and a stablecoin issuer, PayPal can maintain a customer relationship after onramping the dollar into PYUSD, unlike other onramps where value is derived during the transaction alone.\n\nThirdly, I expect that PayPal\u2019s stablecoin could dramatically reduce costs for their global settlement operations.\n\nPayPal makes it easy for someone like me to checkout at a small merchant on a trip to Colombia, but the merchant is charged high fees (up to 4%) to help PayPal cover the settlement costs from USD to local currency and fund the banking operations. However, if PayPal can settle the transaction in USD instead of needing to convert to local currency, they can dramatically reduce their cost basis while still providing currency conversion services upon request, perhaps even through on-chain software instead of banks.\n\nLastly \u2014 and importantly \u2014 stablecoins are good businesses, especially in high interest rate environments. Tether alone made $800+ million last quarter from stablecoin issuance. Even if PayPal can capture $500+ million from interest payments, not including the other revenue streams stablecoins unlock, they could increase their net income by almost 50% and provide recurring, low-risk free cash flow.\n\nWhere PayPal goes from here\n\nEither at launch or soon after, PayPal will likely focus on PYUSD withdrawals to private wallets, merchant payments and issuance on additional blockchains to build more reasons for users to hold and use PYUSD.\n\nI also expect their entry will formally kick off the stablecoin wars, driving many positive narratives and launches for crypto over the next six months.\n\nWhile other known stablecoin issuers are facing declining volumes or regulatory headwinds, PayPal is well positioned to expand stablecoin adoption through its advantages: A trusted brand, a strong regulatory stack and a large e-commerce network.\n\nDisclaimer: I was previously a Product Lead at Paxos from 2020-2022 and worked directly with the PayPal team.

        "content": "Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms Inc. made millions of dollars by selling power rather than producing the tokens in the second quarter as the crypto-mining industry continued to grapple with the impact of low digital asset prices.\n\nThe Castle Rock, Colorado-based company had $13.5 million in power curtailment credits during the quarter, while generating $49.7 million in mining revenue. Riot booked $27.3 million in power curtailment credits last year and $6.5 million in 2021 from power sales to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which is the grid operator for the Lone Star state."

        "content": "Binance on Tuesday became the first crypto exchange to receive full operating licenses under El Salvador\u2019s new digital assets regulation, almost two years after the Central American country became the first to declare Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nAs Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, faces scrutiny from global regulators, its approval by El Salvador\u2019s central bank and National Commission of Digital Assets represents a step forward for the embattled company, even as it\u2019s forced out of other jurisdictions.\n\nIn a statement shared with Fortune, Min Lin, Binance\u2019s new head of Latin America, touted the Salvadoran government\u2019s support of crypto, saying that it \u201cproves security and innovation are complementary assets.\u201d\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s embrace of Bitcoin has come with its own stumbles. President Nayib Bukele announced the initiative in June 2021, arguing that a new focus on Bitcoin could help drive independence for the country\u2019s economy, which is reliant on remittances and the U.S. dollar, as well as spur tourism and business development.\n\nElecting for a rapid rollout, the launch just three months later\u2014including a government-sponsored crypto wallet called Chivo\u2014was riddled with bugs and fraud. After incentivizing sign-ups with a $30 reward, Bitcoin adoption quickly slowed, with most businesses and residents sticking with fiat currency.\n\nThe Bukele administration also promised a $1 billion bond backed by Bitcoin that would help lessen its reliance on multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund, although the measure was delayed as the government dragged its feet on passing digital assets regulation.\n\nWhile the bond hasn\u2019t yet materialized, the country\u2019s legislature finally passed the law in January, which established the National Commission of Digital Assets. In April, the crypto firm Bitfinex\u2014a partner on the Bitcoin bond project\u2014became the first platform to receive a license under the new regulatory regime. The crypto payments app Strike also received one of the first licenses, with the company announcing in May that it would move its global headquarters to El Salvador. Its founder, Jack Mallers, was an early supporter of the country\u2019s Bitcoin initiative.\n\nWith Tuesday\u2019s announcement, Binance is the first exchange to receive operating licenses from both El Salvador\u2019s central bank and its National Commission of Digital Assets. According to the company, it now has approvals and registrations in 18 global markets.\n\nDespite its approval in El Salvador, and a recent victory in Dubai, Binance has been under heat from global regulators. In the U.S., it faces lawsuits from both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, plus likely imminent action from the Department of Justice. The exchange has also faced scrutiny from European authorities, with French prosecutors investigating the company for violating anti-money-laundering laws and Dutch regulators rejecting its application to become a virtual assets services provider.\n\nBinance\u2019s approval in El Salvador also comes with caveats, as the Bukele administration faces criticism for authoritarian actions, including a recent crackdown on gang activity and a push for a constitutionally prohibited consecutive term.\n\nBukele once declared himself the \u201ccoolest dictator in the world\u201d in his Twitter bio. It now reads \u201cPhilosopher King.\u201d"

Lower inflation should mean the Federal Reserve will be less likely to raise rates. Oliver Rust, head of product at independent inflation data aggregator Truflation, predicts that the inflation numbers will show that CPI spiked from 3% to 3.4% in July. \u201cOver the past three months, the rapid decline in inflation allowed consumers to regain their purchasing power, with wages growing at a faster rate than prices. This has resulted in the resurgence of rampant consumer spending, pushing up prices in the all-important food category,\u201d Rust wrote in a morning note."

There are no insiders, all the information is public. And that's what makes it clearly a commodity.\"\n\nBut as you go from bitcoin to Ethereum and other assets, Hougan said, the degree of centralized control increases and the question will eventually get more complex, an obstacle he believes legislation will solve.\n\n\"You have the two largest regulators disagreeing on whether most crypto assets are securities or commodities,\" Hougan added, referring to past classification efforts between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\n\"The right solution there is for legislators to come through and make that clear so that U.S. innovators can win in the market.\"\n\nBesides Ark, eight other organizations including Hougan's firm, Bitwise, have filed applications for a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale has also filed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot fund.\n\nShould the SEC move forward with the approval process, he said the best outcome for investors would be the approval of multiple products.\n\n\"I think there should be a fair playing field that allows us to have multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs that compete in the market,\" Hougan said. \"It will allow prices to be the lowest, it will allow competition to be the highest, [and] it will allow service to be the highest.\"\n\nDisclaimer"

        "content": "In early August, sources leaked word that officials with the United State Department of Justice were considering fraud charges aimed at Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange. However, they indicated, officials are worried that it could cause a run on the market akin to the November 2022 collapse of FTX.\n\nThose concerns have not deterred the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from levying their own charges against Binance, which in part accused the exchange and its founder, Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao, of allowing Americans to use products they are prohibited from accessing and of manipulating trading volume with a market-maker called Sigma Chain that Zhao \u201cowned and controlled.\u201d\n\nTo put the numbers in perspective, at the time of writing, Binance had facilitated $7 billion in trading volume over the preceding 24-hour period. Coinbase facilitated a relatively paltry $970 million, while KuCoin \u2014 another well-known exchange \u2014 fell short of $350 million.\n\nWith markets in flux and lingering questions over whether central banks will pull off a \u201csoft landing\u201d for the global economy in the months ahead, it\u2019s fair to wonder what the implications might be if law enforcement joins regulators in targeting Binance. For feedback, we asked a number of Cointelegraph staffers for their thoughts \u2014 and how they plan to handle their own investments if the Justice Department does file charges against Binance or its executives.\n\nCointelegraph: How do you think the market will respond if the DOJ issues charges related to Binance? Are you going to be buying or selling when that happens?\n\nJoe Hall, reporter:\n\nBitcoin will likely drop if the Justice Department issues charges related to Binance, and the broader crypto industry might faceplant. But the need for sound, decentralized, censorship-resistant money is global: Bitcoin buyers in Africa, Europe and Latin America will gobble up the dip. Personally, I\u2019m going to keep asking myself (and my Bitcoin node): Will there only ever be 21 million Bitcoin? If the answer is \u201cYes,\u201d then I will continue to earn, save and spend in Bitcoin. (Spoiler alert, the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d)\n\nCT: Where do you think the price of Bitcoin will stand on Dec. 31?\n\nJH: $38,000. Dr. Adam Back, Paolo Ardoino (chief technology officer of Bitfinex/Tether) and Giacomo Zucco (a Bitcoin consultant) have all told me they believe Bitcoin will be above $35,000 by the end of this year. They\u2019re pretty smart Bitcoin people. How high the price could go before the halving is anyone\u2019s guess, but it does feel (for the umpteenth time) that sentiment toward Bitcoin is slowly warming up.\n\nTom Blackstone, reporter:\n\nIn my experience, news like this has very little impact on the market long-term, for three reasons. First, charges don\u2019t mean much unless there is a conviction, and trials can take a very long time. Second, if one exchange goes down, another one will pop up to replace it. Third, crypto is too useful for consumers to give up, and interest in it is growing organically as more people learn about it. So, I think it will continue to be a good investment regardless of the news cycle.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? On a chart, Bitcoin has support at $15,300 and resistance at $41,000, so I would expect its price to be in that range by the end of the year.\n\nRelated: Demand is driving the price of Bitcoin to $130K\n\nJonathan DeYoung, senior copy editor:\n\nMy investment thesis is to hold on for dear life and hope that the market continues to grow over the medium to long term. I rarely, if ever, even look at what I\u2019ve saved. I try to forget it exists, and crypto pretty much never enters my brain when I think about financial planning for the near term. This offers me a level of psychological insolation from market-moving events, such as might be the case if Binance were charged.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? Now that I have no particular thoughts on.\n\nCassio Gusson, reporter for Cointelegraph Brasil:\n\nIt will be a big blow to the market. There will likely be an asset drain from Binance, and this will greatly damage the exchange\u2019s image globally. This will affect the price of Bitcoin and the entire system of assets on BNB Chain. There will likely be a new crash similar to what happened with Terra, with several investors withdrawing assets in protocol staking on BNB Chain, withdrawing assets from Binance and in exchange-related products such as PancakeSwap.\n\nIt will be a big blow to the market.

There will likely be a new crash similar to what happened with Terra, with several investors withdrawing assets in protocol staking on BNB Chain, withdrawing assets from Binance and in exchange-related products such as PancakeSwap.\n\nI\u2019ll be selling on the day it happens. I\u2019ll be buying in the next 48 hours after the event has already reached its bottom and buyers resume trading.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? I don\u2019t think it will be more than $40,000. There are studies that show that the impact of Bitcoin\u2019s halving is decreasing. We could reach $40,000 if the Securities and Exchange Commission approves a Bitcoin spot ETF. Otherwise, a maximum of $35,000.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: Even worse for crypto than central exchanges\n\nKristina Lucrezia Corn\u00e8r, editor-in-chief:\n\nIn the nascent landscape of the blockchain market, accusations leveled against major players like Binance send shockwaves through the whole industry and its closely-knit community. And these allegations not only target specific individuals but also challenge the overall credibility and reputation of our sector. What follows is a dynamic process akin to a seismic event, reshaping perceptions and redefining power dynamics within the ecosystem.\n\nBut these shockwaves aren\u2019t just disruptive; they foster growth and transformation, reinforcing the industry\u2019s values, unearthing its concealed resources, and nurturing sustainability and positive change. Amid challenges, the blockchain sector emerges stronger, fortified by its ability to embrace improvements and navigate vulnerabilities. And so does Bitcoin.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? For me personally, the value of Bitcoin is felt not as absolute numbers but rather as a comparative value with the strength of other currencies we use, and I strongly believe that in this sense, its value will only continue to grow, even while maintaining its volatility. If, on Dec. 31, one Bitcoin can buy one Tesla Model 3 [$32,740 after a tax credit, as of Aug. 8], I will even forgive Elon Musk for giving up on the bird. Maybe. (This is not investment or moral advice!)\n\nFelix Ng, editor:\n\nI\u2019ve seen enough companies collapse to know that nothing and no one is \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d crypto firm or not. That being said, it still seems unlikely that such charges would completely shut down crypto\u2019s biggest exchange.\n\nHowever, charges for Binance would likely cause a dip in crypto prices and a shifting of funds to other exchanges or cold wallets. Another exchange could rocket up to the top position. It\u2019s happened throughout the history of crypto. If there is a sharp dip, I\u2019ll be buying.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? Finger in the air? $32,000. The Christmas period has historically been a positive one for Bitcoin, so assuming BTC trades mostly sideways for the next six months, we should get a little spike near Christmas.\n\nMarcel Pechman, reporter:\n\nBinance (mostly) doesn\u2019t operate in the U.S., so the impact, if any, will be minimal. The BitMEX case, which was very similar, resulted in $100 million in fines and house arrest for the founders, and that\u2019s it. Sure, there might be additional steps for U.S. market makers currently operating on Binance international, and U.S. citizens will be forced to use a VPN at all times when using the exchange, which may reduce volumes by 20%\u201330% max. Other than that, if Bitcoin plunges solely due to Binance\u2019s case, it\u2019s a buying opportunity.\n\nIn my opinion, Tether remains the most significant risk for the ecosystem, as there\u2019s literally zero use for a stablecoin without fiat gateways (in theory).\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? No idea. Seriously. I always bet on prices staying the same for zero to six months. My guess is that an ETF approval could cause between 50% and 130% gains in two months, so if we start at $30,000, we could get to $69,000.\n\nRelated: BlackRock\u2019s misguided effort to create \u2018Crypto for Dummies\u2019\n\nRay Salmond, head of markets:\n\nIf significant enforcement action came from the DOJ, to the extent of a Red Notice being issued for CZ\u2019s arrest or Binance being shuttered \u2014 even temporarily \u2014 I think this would have a sharp, negative impact on the broader crypto market and Bitcoin\u2019s price. I\u2019ve been looking at the Bitcoin price chart literally every day for more than six years, and I\u2019ve been buying the entire time. I dollar cost average \u2014 and I no longer use derivatives heavily \u2014 so I\u2019m agnostic to price and beyond any emotional shock from Binance blowing up and the impact it could have on crypto.\n\nI pretty much view any sharp downside move in BTC and ETH as an accumulation opportunity. I also always use 1 BTC as a trading instrument, where I sell it at micro tops and rebuy at swing lows, so most of my Bitcoin has no cost beyond the cost of taxes on trading. For this reason, my risk tolerance might be different than other investors, and any sharp dip in BTC price is something I view as an opportunity. Somehow, this magic money always finds a way to go back up.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? I don\u2019t have any. The current trading range is too tight. We\u2019re still within that range, and volatility is at a multiyear low.\n\nArijit Sarkar, editor:\n\nIf the Justice Department drops charges against Binance, there will be a momentary price drop because of panic sellers. But it won\u2019t have a long-term effect. When Mt. Gox collapsed, people thought it was the end of Bitcoin because the exchange was managing 80% of the in-circulation BTC. But we\u2019re here having the same discussion a decade later.\n\nI\u2019m not going to panic sell even if the price drops. I\u2019m going to silently accumulate more Bitcoin and wait for the bull market to reap the rewards of patience.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? Bitcoin\u2019s historical performance indicates something around the $25,000 mark. I\u2019m expecting it to momentarily fall in the third and fourth quarters of 2023, mainly due to rising regulatory hurdles, the government\u2019s growing affinity toward central bank digital currencies and the ongoing concern of ecosystem collapses.\n\nHowever, this is all par for the course prior to the halving in April 2024. Bitcoin\u2019s price has shot up every time we\u2019ve had a halving event. I\u2019m utilizing the next three quarters to dollar cost average and accumulate as many Bitcoin/sats as possible.\n\nRudy Takala, opinion editor:\n\nAltcoins look appealing right now. Coins like Algorand are 5%\u201310% off their all-time lows. They could sink a little before the market picks up, but that\u2019s more likely to be a product of time capitulation than of panic sellers reacting to a Binance indictment or any other news event. I doubt most tokens will drop more than 30% from here, regardless of what happens.\n\nBTC Price on Dec. 31? $32,500. The only thing I\u2019m going to regret is that I didn\u2019t buy more.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether dip but more bullish times ahead? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin dipped on Thursday morning in Asia after briefly breaching the US$30,000 resistance level. Ether also dipped, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Cardano\u2019s ADA token led the winners. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index moved higher. However, trading volume dropped after a surge earlier in the week. U.S. stock futures logged losses Wednesday but were trading higher on Thursday morning in Asia. Investors now await key U.S. inflation data with an eye on how that will affect the Fed\u2019s decision making on interest rates.\n\nBitcoin dips but set for bullish trend\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.72% in the last 24 hours to US$29,592.49 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, but rose 1.59% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached a high of US$30,093.44 on Wednesday evening, but struggled to stay above the US$30,000 threshold.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin prices remain range bound, the token is set for a bullish trend, said Samer Hasn, market analyst at Australia-based global multi-asset broker XS.com.\n\n\u201cWe witnessed the number of open interest positions (in Bitcoin) rise to the highest level since October of 2022 with more than 10.4 billion positions on August 8,\u201d Hasn said.\n\nHe added that a high number of open interests, which includes long and short positions, generally precedes a rise in momentum and increased volatility.\n\n\u201cThe increase in the number of open positions reflects more positive sentiment among investors with more recognition,\u201d Hasn said, adding that the new offering of the PYUSD stablecoin from PayPal \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest payment companies \u2014 will increase access to cryptocurrency networks.\n\nSimilarly, spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund applications from major investment firms like BlackRock and Wisdom Tree will, if approved by U.S. regulators, provide \u201cmore access by individual investors, institutional investors, and large companies that may not be able to invest in cryptocurrencies directly,\u201d Hasn said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether dipped 0.21% to US$1,856.01 but held a weekly gain of 0.94%. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Cardano\u2019s ADA leading the winners, while Binance\u2019s BNB, Tron\u2019s TRX and Litecoin logged losses.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA rose 1.03% to US$0.3016 for a weekly gain of 0.75% after the Cardano mainnet launched the Bitcoin token cBTC on Wednesday. The launch will allow Bitcoin holders to tokenize their Bitcoin on the Cardano network as cBTC and use it in Cardano\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\n\nBitcoin, meet Cardano.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited to announce mainnet is now LIVE \ud83d\udc7c\n\n\n\nMainnet below \u26c5\ufe0f\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/j6vHNUKIlL pic.twitter.com/Li81Pr8fpn \u2014 anetaBTC \ud83d\udc7c Mainnet Live (@anetaBTC) August 8, 2023\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.31% in the past 24 hours to US$1.18 trillion, while trading volume remained flat, inching down 1.11% to US$35.54 billion.\n\nThe future is now for gaming NFTs\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.71% in the past 24 hours to 2,493.11 as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, and notched a 0.10% gain for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum and Solana NFT indexes also logged gains, while the indexes for Polygon and Cardano dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 16.72% in the past 24 hours to over US$16.31 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains all also logged losses.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Polygon-based DraftKings saw the largest 24-hour sales volume, but fell 65.56% to US$1.43 million. Still, those sales accounted for over 50% of the total NFT trading volume on the Polygon network. The collection is based on sports and betting company DraftKings\u2019 NFT games.\n\n\u201cDraftKings did huge numbers, at one point reflecting over US$4.6 million on CryptoSlam\u2019s collection rankings,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cThese are being driven by fantasy football packs in the Reignmakers series. Packs range from US$20 to US$9,999, and some with supplies of over 50k packs. You can see how with brands like DraftKings and the National Football League (NFL), and prices like that, how they can rack up millions of dollars in sales in a day.\u201d\n\nAccording to Petscher, winter in the market can be a blessing for NFTs used in play-to-earn games.\n\n\u201cThis bear market is sorta like the Great Reset for NFTs,\u201d said Petscher in a Wednesday tweet. \u201cWithout it traders would still be conditioned for unrealistic gains. Now they\u2019ll be happy for a few dollars here, maybe 20 bucks there, and then some home runs every so often. Expect to see more numbers like DraftKings, DMarket Gods Unchained and Sorare.\u201d\n\nIn CryptoSlams\u2019 NFT collection ranking, DraftKings, Mythos Chain-based DMarket, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained and Ethereum-based Sorare took up the top 5 spots by seven-day sales volume.\n\n\u201cMythos Chain, Polygon, ImmutableX, and Ethereum are all represented in CryptoSlam\u2019s Top Five Collections so far this week, and show the multi-chain future that\u2019s not just ahead of us. It\u2019s here,\u201d tweeted Petscher on Thursday.\n\nElsewhere, Canadian musician and producer Claire Elise Boucher, known professionally as Grimes, said in an interview with U.S. magazine Wired that she has earned more money from NFTs than from her music career. Boucher sold around US$6 million worth of NFTs in an auction in early 2021.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sad about what happened to NFTs and crypto, because it got polluted fast with people trying to make as much money as possible,\u201d said Boucher in the interview.\n\n\u201cBut I do want to think about compensating artists, especially digital artists. And I hope when the aggro niche dies down, we can come back,\u201d she said.\n\n(Updates with NFT section.)\n\nU.S. equity futures up ahead of key inflation data\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, after the stock market closed lower on Wednesday.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes were mixed on Wednesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s Kospi logged losses, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei moved up.\n\nInvestors are now waiting for the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) in July, which is set for release on Thursday. Analysts expect the annual inflation rate to hit 3.3% in July, up from 3.0% in June, with the monthly rate remaining unchanged at 0.2%.\n\nHowever, an acceleration in the annual inflation rate would not necessarily equate to a reverse of the recent inflation slowdown.\n\nTalking to The Wall Street Journal, Laura Rosner, founding partner at advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives, pointed to this time last year when inflation peaked in June and then slowed down in the following month.\n\nA monthly inflation rate of 0.2% in June would be consistent with the moderate inflation that the Federal Reserve wants to see, Rosner said.\n\nMeanwhile, Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said on Tuesday the Fed might be ready to pause interest rate hikes.\n\n\u201cAbsent any alarming new data between now and mid-September, I believe we may be at the point where we can be patient and hold rates steady and let the monetary policy actions we have taken do their work,\u201d said Harker.\n\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 87.0% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September, up from 86.5% on Wednesday.\n\nElsewhere, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order Wednesday to regulate U.S. investment in Chinese entities engaged in three sectors: semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies, and artificial intelligence.\n\nHowever, the sectors listed in the order were narrower than expected, which some analysts interpret as a sign that Biden\u2019s administration is seeking to improve relations with China.\n\n\u201cFor the business community, this is relatively good news,\u201d Sarah Bauerle Danzman, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and associate professor of international studies at Indiana University, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively narrow notification process and a very narrow set of prohibitions.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "content": "Traders have been sitting on their hands lately with the Bitcoin price being stuck between $29,000 and $30,000. This rangebound price action can\u2019t continue forever, though.\n\nBitcoin awaits breakout\n\nA recent report from ARK Invest entitled \u201cBitcoin \u2014 Breakout or Breakdown?\u201d notes that \u201cBitcoin\u2019s volatility dropped to a 6-year low during July, suggesting the potential for significant price action in either direction.\u201d\n\nThis is not news to anyone watching the crypto markets lately.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price Bollinger Bands echo January gains\n\nWhat traders might not be anticipating, however, is the historical price action for Bitcoin (BTC) during the months of August and September, along with the effects of monetary policy on cryptocurrency markets.\n\nMarkets haven\u2019t fully priced in Fed tightening\n\nThe ARK Invest report suggests that Federal Reserve tightening could be \u201ca leading indicator of price deflation\u201d and notes that there can be a lag associated with monetary policy.\n\nIn other words, \u201cthe real economy and inflation have yet to digest 300-500 basis points\u201d of Fed tightening. China\u2019s exporting of deflation also adds fuel to the deflationary fire, the report states.\n\nFederal funds effective rate: current and lagged. Source: ARK Invest\n\nThis puts the lagging effect of Fed tightening on course to collide with Bitcoin\u2019s halving rally in 2024-2025. If ARK\u2019s analysis proves to be correct, the next bull run will likely be tame compared to previous cycles.\n\nYet some analysts believe just the opposite: Because the Fed has finished raising rates (or is nearing the end of its tightening cycle), the macro situation is about to become even more auspicious for Bitcoin.\n\nMorpher CEO Martin Froehler recently told Forbes that he expects the 2023 Bitcoin rally to resume:\n\n\u201cWe are almost done with the interest rate hike cycle, so the current macroeconomic headwinds will soon begin to fade. Simultaneously, we are about 9 months away from the next Bitcoin halving event, which historically has always propelled the price up dramatically.\u201d\n\nKyle DaCruz, director of digital assets product at VanEck, expressed similar sentiments to Forbes by saying that Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity combined with unprecedented growth in the money supply could lead to a continued rally.\n\nIf history is any guide, however, that rally isn\u2019t likely to materialize just yet.\n\nBTC price rally to resume in 2024?\n\nHistorically speaking, August and September are the worst months of the year for the BTC price.\n\nFrom 2011-2022, August saw a positive performance for BTC only five times, with the other seven years being in the red. September is even worse, with just four out of 12 months seeing a positive performance.\n\nHistorical Bitcoin monthly price performance table. Source: Bitcoinmonthlyreturn.com\n\nWhat\u2019s more, five of the 12 negative Septembers saw only single-digit price decreases, a small move for an asset as historically volatile as BTC/USD. The average move in September has been -5%, while the average move in August stands at +0.73%.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has indeed flatlined in the past few weeks, with BTC price volatility falling to record lows.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin market observer Will Clemente notes that all of Bitcoin\u2019s negatively performing years have occurred two years post-halving, suggesting the worst of the bear market could be in the past.\n\nBitcoin's down years have all come in the second year after the halving.

As noted earlier, however, if this timeline coincides with the deflation and potential recession forecast by ARK Invest, downward pressure on the BTC price may offset many of the gains in the next potential bull cycle.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Though the show had rarely, if ever, mentioned cryptocurrency prior to its most recent episode, digital assets have steadily become a part of mainstream movies and television series, from animated shows like South Park to Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nInterestingly, Futurama did not address why the characters \u2014 even in a fictionalized comedic future \u2014 would still be mining Bitcoin in 3023. Based on the BTC halving process, estimates suggest the last block reward will most likely come in roughly 2140, at which point the incentive for miners \"can transition entirely to transaction fees\", according to the Bitcoin white paper.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises\n\nUpdate (Aug. 14 at 2:12 PM UTC): This article has been updated to include details on incentives for Bitcoin miners."

        "content": "Billionaire David Rubenstein says that Bitcoin (BTC) isn\u2019t going anywhere now due to a wave of massive interest in the king crypto spread around the globe.\n\nIn a new interview with Bloomberg, the legendary investor and co-founder of financial services titan Carlyle Group says that interest in BTC and other prominent crypto assets is ramping up worldwide as consumers increasingly covet private transactions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that when interest rates are as high as they are, you don\u2019t need to have gold or other kinds of things to get you some solid return, because you get 5% on treasuries. But eventually [that] 5% will be coming down at some point.\n\nI don\u2019t think Bitcoin and other better-known cryptocurrencies are going to go away. There\u2019s enormous interest around the world in being able to have something you can transfer without the government knowing about it and keeping it private. You can say that people shouldn\u2019t do that, but that\u2019s not going to stop people from doing it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rubenstein, even though there is a divide in opinion on crypto among US officials, the rest of the world is becoming more and more open minded. He says people have a strong desire for an alternative currency outside the purview of governments.\n\n\u201cI think Democrats in Congress and particularly the people regulating, the SEC, are skeptical of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But outside the United States, there\u2019s a lot of interest in it. I think FTX really hurt when it went bankrupt\u2026\n\nBut a lot of people around the world want to be able to trade in a currency that their government can\u2019t know what they have and they want to be moving [it] around, rightly or wrongly. And so I don\u2019t think Bitcoin is going away. I think the Republicans on Capitol Hill have been pretty supportive of it.\u201d\n\nThe SEC currently has pending lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, two of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, on allegations that the platforms have been selling unregistered securities.\n\nBitcoin is trading for $29,735 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) can easily end up below $25,000 next month, says one longtime market observer.\n\nIn a new BTC price outlook, Timothy Peterson, founder and investment manager at Cane Island Alternative Advisors, put the odds of a dip to local lows at 50/50.\n\nBTC price may see \u201clast big dip\u201d in September\n\nWhile Bitcoin bulls continue their breakout attempts above $30,000, various popular traders and analysts have their sights on lower levels.\n\nPeterson, well known for his technical insights, now believes that the typical August and September performance may yield a return to the $25,000 mark.\n\nUploading a chart of monthly performance statistics for BTC/USD to X (formerly known as Twitter), he concluded that a \u201clast big dip\u201d may hit before September is over. Put another way, BTC price downside over the next six weeks or so could top 15%.\n\n\u201cThere is a 50% chance that bitcoin will drop below $25,000 before the end of September,\u201d accompanying commentary stated.\n\n\u201cThis would be the last big dip before the next big bull run cycle commences.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD monthly returns comparison. Source: Timothy Peterson/X\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, September is traditionally a \u201cbad\u201d month for Bitcoin bulls. Since 2017, BTC price action has finished the month lower than its starting price every year.\n\nAugust, meanwhile, is a mixed bag, offering either modest gains or modest losses, with 2017 as a notable exception.\n\nBitcoin Lowest Price Forward says $100,000 by mid-2026\n\nContinuing, Peterson doubled down on Bitcoin\u2019s bullish outlook.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price can go \u2018full bull\u2019 next month if 200-week trendline stays\n\nIn addition to predicting a final significant retracement before the bull run, recent analysis gave a deadline of less than 1,000 days \u2014 less than three years \u2014 for BTC/USD to hit a giant $100,000.\n\nThis came courtesy of the \u201cLowest Price Forward\u201d metric, which delivers price prognoses for specific dates in the future.\n\nFormerly known as a calculator of Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cnever look back price,\u201d Its claim to fame lies in correctly predicting Bitcoin\u2019s last ever visit to $10,000 in September 2020.\n\n\u201cIf you dismissed Bitcoin\u2019s \u2018Lowest Price Forward\u2019 trend because of the dip in 2022, remember that Bitcoin\u2019s price normally dips below the trend after a bear market,\u201d a confident Peterson wrote in an X post on Aug. 8.\n\n\u201cBear markets are for waiting, not doubting.

        "title": "Bitcoin Lightning Network is growing, but 3 major challenges remain - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Lightning Network is a layer-2 solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, and its primary objective is to address the Bitcoin network\u2019s scalability issues. It also allows for faster and cheaper transactions by facilitating off-chain payments through a network of payment channels.\n\nThe Lightning Network has gained traction since its launch in 2018, hitting a total value locked of $140 million, but this is relatively small compared to Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) $580 billion market capitalization. However, this oversimplification disregards that this scaling solution focuses on instant transactions, not lending, yield farms or other activities that require staking.\n\nAdditionally, the number of nodes has grown by a mere 6% since June 2022. This suggests that there are significant reasons why it has not achieved mainstream adoption. Let\u2019s take a look at a few of the factors influencing Lightning Network growth.\n\nChannel balancing, finding liquidity and the associated costs impact network growth\n\nIf Lightning Network users wish to make a payment that exceeds their channel balance, they must find a well-funded node with a direct channel to the recipient to facilitate the transaction. This process can be challenging and time-consuming, especially if the recipient is not well connected within the Lightning Network.\n\nChannel balancing requires users to manage the funds in their channels effectively. Rebalancing is automatic when using apps like the Phoenix or Breeze, but it adds complexity for mid-level users relying on their own nodes. According to Viktor Bunin, protocol specialist at Coinbase Cloud:\n\n\u201cThis capital inefficiency at the edges for non-custodial users is a hard and annoying optimization problem, and it\u2019s objectively worse than an account-based model with arbitrary transaction sizing. However, it\u2019s not an unworkable problem.\u201d\n\nBesides the issue of optimizing the channels\u2019 funding, there are also the associated costs of opening and closing channels, as it requires an on-chain transaction. That can create serious issues if the median fee surpasses $5 or $10, which would drastically limit the use for the lower-income population and disincentive the network capillarity.\n\nThe risk of development hiccups could be pushing potential users away\n\nThe Lightning Network is still under development, meaning it still faces certain security risks. One concern is that if a node goes offline, it becomes unable to process payments through the channels it is connected to. This disrupts the payment process until the node comes back online, potentially causing an inconvenience for users.\n\nBunin highlights that there are no offline methods for Lightning payments, but noncustodial wallets offer \u201cclever workarounds\u201d using background tasks in mobile devices. Still, this solution might present constraints if the device\u2019s operating system limits the performance to preserve battery power.\n\nDouble-spending is a risk on any blockchain-based system, including the Lightning Network. This attack could emerge from a node being offline for too long, subsequently providing an incorrect state and returning coins to the other party. This risk emerges only if the user is not active to inform the \u201cjustice transaction\u201d or hasn\u2019t set up \u201cwatchtowers\u201d to prove that a fraud is being committed when a channel closing is requested.\n\nDragging merchant adoption and user awareness\n\nThe widespread adoption of any payment system requires acceptance by a large number of merchants and high user awareness. However, the Lightning Network faces challenges in both areas.\n\nMerchant adoption is limited due to complexities in integrating the Lightning Network into existing payment systems, concerns about Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility and regulatory uncertainties. On the other hand, efforts are being made to increase merchant adoption through user-friendly point-of-sale systems and partnerships with payment processors.\n\nFor instance, Zeus and OpenNode are popular wallets that offer a user-friendly point-of-sale app for merchants. The app allows merchants to accept Lightning Network payments with a QR code or NFC scan.\n\nAdditionally, user awareness about the Lightning Network\u2019s benefits and usage is still relatively low. Educating users about the advantages and ease of Lightning payments is essential to overcoming this limitation.\n\nWhat is the future of the Bitcoin Lightning Network?\n\nBesides the more obvious problems cited, including channel rebalancing and security risks, developers are working on payments that can be made when the receiver is offline, known as asynchronous (async).\n\nAn important milestone for this Bitcoin scaling solution has been its integration by the Binance exchange in July. The reduced fees for withdrawal are a major selling point in comparison to wrapped Bitcoin options available on competing blockchains. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed in August that the exchange is also looking forward to implementing Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning network.\n\nThis layer-2 scaling solution holds immense potential to enhance Bitcoin\u2019s transaction efficiency and scalability. As the technology matures and efforts are made to address these issues, the scaling solution may eventually gain broader acceptance and increased adoption.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin whales are major market players who can influence the price of bitcoin when they decide to buy or sell large volumes of the digital currency.\n\nBitcoin whales can significantly impact the price of bitcoin when they decide to buy or sell BTC in large quantities, making them some of the most important Bitcoin market participants.\n\nRead on to learn more about bitcoin whales, how they influence the market, and how you can spot them.\n\nWhat Are Bitcoin Whales?\n\nBitcoin whales are individuals or entities holding large amounts of the digital currency and have the potential to impact price movements with a single trade.\n\nThe widely accepted minimum threshold for a bitcoin whale is 1,000 BTC.\n\nThe term \u201cbitcoin whale\u201d is a colloquial phrase to put the size of the holding in perspective when compared to other \u201csmaller fish\u201d in the market. The wallet owner can be an individual or a group pooling resources to make significant investments.\n\nHow Do Whales Influence the Market?\n\nWhales\u2019 position as the biggest players in the Bitcoin market makes them highly influential. Their significant holdings allow them to significantly affect bitcoin\u2019s immediate demand or supply on exchanges (or via OTC trading desks) whenever they trade. As a result, the market often responds with price movements.\n\nThe price of bitcoin often rallies when a while decides to add to their bitcoin position due to the size of their trades. Conversely, if a Bitcoin whale opts to exit their position by selling a portion of their holdings, the price tends to respond with a decline.\n\nMoreover, a lot of whales\u2019 wallets are publicly tracked, which results in the wider Bitcoin trading community responding to whale\u2019s trading decisions (or expected trades), often resulting in a large price movement as many traders mirror the whale\u2019s (expected) trade.\n\nConsequently, some whales prefer trading with others directly via OTC trading desks to limit their impact on the price. However, some whales trading on exchanges may take the opportunity to move the market in the direction they want by signaling to the market that they are a large buyer or seller.\n\nThree Ways to Spot a Bitcoin Whale\n\nKnowing how to spot a Bitcoin whale can be a helpful addition to your Bitcoin trading arsenal, given its potential to impact the market with a simple buy or sell order.\n\nLet\u2019s look at three ways you can spot a Bitcoin whale.\n\nUse Blockchain Explorers : Bitcoin\u2019s public ledger allows you access to all transactions. Using a blockchain explorer such as blockchain.com, you can identify large amounts of bitcoin being moved . Analyze Trade Patterns : Whales tend to execute large trades, leading to sudden price dips or spikes. If you pay attention to trading patterns, the emergence of unusual patterns might signify a Bitcoin whale making a move. Social Media : Some bitcoin whales are active on social media, sharing their opinions on investment strategies and the bitcoin market. You can gain some insights into their potential trading activities and use information.\n\nBiggest Bitcoin Whales in the Market\n\nAccording to this bitcoin whales chart, as of July 2023, there are 2,018 BTC wallets with balances of over 1,000 BTC. Some notable whales have held onto their bitcoin for the long term.\n\nLet\u2019s look at five of the most notable, publicly known bitcoin whales.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto : The identity of Bitcoin\u2019s creator remains unknown, with no clear evidence of whether it is an individual or a group of people. Whoever they may be, they mined approximately 1 million BTC, and the wallet has remained inactive for years. Changpeng Zhao : With an estimated net worth of over $10 billion, the Binance co-founder is one of the top crypto billionaires. While the size of his BTC holdings is unknown, he\u2019s indicated in the past that crypto forms 95% of his portfolio. The Winklevoss Twins : Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss started adding bitcoin to their portfolio in 2012. At some point, they owned approximately 1% of bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply. Michael Saylor/MicroStrategy : Through MicroStrategy, his business analytics software company, Michael Saylor holds approximately 150,000 BTC. He\u2019s one of the most vocal Bitcoin advocates, especially on his Twitter account, where he shares the benefits of Bitcoin. Tim Draper : The American venture capitalist famously bought 29,656 bitcoin from the U.S. Marshalls when Silk Road assets were auctioned. He is a prominent opponent of government overreach and advocates for decentralization. The size of his current BTC holdings is unknown, but he continues to be a vocal advocate.\n\nSpotting a bitcoin whale\u2019s activities can help you make shrewd moves in the market. However, remember that even whales can make emotional decisions without rationality. Some may even seek to manipulate the market to benefit themselves. Ensure you go beyond tracking their activities and find their reasons before making decisions."

This week, the SEC closes the public comment period for many of the funds.\n\nGary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has voiced his concern over fraud and manipulation in the industry, and Grayscale has urged that any potential approval should include prior funds that have been rejected.\n\nAccording to Wood, the focus will be on marketing and communication because the majority of the fund will essentially be the same."

The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency briefly dropped to a low of US$28,724.14 on early Tuesday morning.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw outflows totaling US$107 million in the week ending August 4, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. That marked the fourth consecutive week of outflows as profit taking gathered pace in recent weeks.\n\nBitcoin-related products saw weekly outflows totaling US$111 million, the largest for a week since March. However, outflows into Bitcoin short positions stopped for the first time in the past 14 weeks, according to the CoinShares report. Allowing investors to profit when the token\u2019s price drops, the report\u2019s authors said that the stall in short position outflows suggests institutional investors may be adjusting their Bitcoin strategies.\n\nEther dipped 0.13% to US$1,824.53, and lost 1.72% over the past seven days.\n\nPaypal ramped up its efforts in the Web3 space by launching the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin on Monday. The Ethereum-based token is issued by Paxos Trust Company \u2014 the U.S.-based issuer of Binance\u2019s BUSD stablecoin \u2014 and is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. treasuries and similar cash equivalents.\n\nPaypal\u2019s stablecoin project was reportedly halted in February 2023 amid increased scrutiny from U.S. regulators toward stablecoins \u2014 including an order for Paxos to stop minting BUSD.\n\nToday, we\u2019re unveiling a new stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD).

The meme token dropped 1.65% to US$0.07325 and logged a weekly loss of 5.86%.\n\nThe month of July saw a decrease in crypto trading activities, with Bitcoin volume decreasing 13.1% during the month, Ether falling by 21.9% and stablecoins volumes down 12.3%.\n\n\u201cThe data emphasizes a moment of low activity in the market, which follows a strong uptrend in the first half of 2023,\u201d said Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset and fintech investment firm Fineqia International.\n\n\u201cSummer months are notoriously among the ones with the lowest level of trading activity and 2023 data are perfectly aligned with historical metrics on the matter. The overall outlook for 2023 remains extremely positive so far as the institutional / service providers\u2019 news seen in the past few weeks still indicates strong interest towards the market,\u201d Greco added.\n\nFor Greco, signs of that interest include multiple applications in the U.S. for exchange-traded funds (ETF) for Bitcoin and Ether. He also pointed to Hong Kong, where regulators have granted crypto exchanges HashKey Exchange and OKX licenses to offer crypto trading services to retail investors.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.11% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion, while trading volume gained 59.07% to US$32.76 billion.\n\nTremors of NFT excitement following PayPal news\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index gained 0.62% in the past 24 hours to 2,478.88 as of 10:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. However, it was still down 1.36% lower for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana, Polygon and Cardano indexes logged losses.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 15.80% in the past 24 hours to US$13.09 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. The volumes on Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Bitcoin and Cardano blockchains all logged increases.\n\n\u201cPaypal announcing the launch of a stablecoin has excited the NFT market a bit, as they look forward to an easy way to onboard the masses to crypto,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.\n\nHowever, NFT trading activity remains downbeat compared to the meteoric highs of late 2021 and 2022. Total NFT trading volume last week totaled US$87.76 million, over 60% lower than the start of the year, according to CryptoSlam.\n\n\u201cNow, sales volume is clearly lower. (But) It\u2019s not the only measurement of growth,\u201d said Petscher in a Youtube video posted Monday. Unique buyers, unique sellers and total transactions have all grown considerably since this time two years ago, he added.\n\n\u201cBut the ecosystem has matured. The NFTs are getting cheaper. The supply is getting greater. It\u2019s a different space. And it\u2019s exactly what we need to reach the masses,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nIn terms of NFT collections, Mythos Chain-based NFT marketplace DMarket posted the largest 24-hour trading volume but still dipped 4.48% to US$931,685. ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained Cards and Ethereum-based Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) ranked second and third.\n\nGrails IV, the latest NFT collection issued by NFT startup Proof, started minting on Monday.

Artists will reveal soon which should add some excitement to the space,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nChina export woes and more US rate hikes ahead?\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 11:50 a.m. on Tuesday in Hong Kong after the three major U.S. stock indexes closed higher in regular trading on Monday.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes were mixed on Tuesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and South Korea\u2019s Kospi remained flat, Japan\u2019s Nikkei logged gains, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropped.\n\nAmid the U.S. second-quarter reporting season, 79% of S&P 500 companies have released earnings higher than analyst expectations. That is the highest beat rate since the third quarter of 2021, Reuters reported on Monday citing data from Refinitiv.\n\nInvestors now await U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data on Thursday. Analysts expect core CPI to rise 0.2% in July, which would be the smallest monthly increase in the past two and a half years.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said on Monday that multiple interest rate hikes may still be needed to curb inflation.\n\n\u201cWe have made progress in lowering inflation over the past year, but inflation is still significantly above the FOMC\u2019s two percent target, and the labor market continues to be tight, with job openings still far exceeding the number of available workers,\u201d said Bowman in a Monday speech.\n\n\u201cGiven these developments, I supported raising the federal funds rate at our July meeting, and I expect that additional increases will likely be needed to lower inflation to the FOMC\u2019s goal,\u201d said Bowman.\n\nThe Fed meets on September 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 86.5% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September, and a 13.5% chance the Fed will raise rates by a further 25-basis-points.\n\nElsewhere, China\u2019s exports in July slid 14.5% year-on-year to US$201.16 billion. Imports also posted an annual decrease of 12.4%, Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency reported on Tuesday.\n\nAs the country attempts to support its economic recovery by stimulating domestic demand, the drop in July exports was the biggest decline since February 2020. The figure fell well below analyst expectations.\n\n\u201cThe government policy so far has changed but more on the property sector, and not much on boosting demand,\u201d Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd, told Bloomberg. \u201cSo the economic situation is still quite challenging.\u201d\n\n(Updates to add equities section.)"

The U.S. bond yield curve is inverted\u2014an economic event that has preceded every recession in U.S. history\u2014and the New York Times says that it\u2019s about to get even worse. Interest rates are currently at generational highs, creating devastating credit conditions for many American families. According to JPMorgan analysts, we are likely headed for a recession by the end of 2023 or early 2024.\n\nWhile inflation has finally started to cool down, there\u2019s no denying that Americans are finding life more and more unaffordable. It\u2019s no wonder why more American families than ever are reporting that their salaries aren\u2019t keeping pace with the cost of living\u2014inflation, unlimited government spending, and economic mismanagement are all to blame.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via AmericanCompass, sponsored) Major Costs for a Middle-Class Family of Four vs. Median Male Income.\n\nEnergy and commodity prices have soared to record highs within the last year, and it costs more to heat and power one\u2019s home today than it has in decades. Simply put, many of us can\u2019t afford to make ends meet, and no amount of governmental intervention appears to be working.\n\nIf a recession were to hit, who knows what kind of price we would have to pay?\n\nThe economic indicators of a recession are looming, and they aren\u2019t getting any better. Gasoline prices are about 61.5% higher than they were only a few years ago. In July, the national average price at the pump surged by over 4 cents in a single day\u2014a rare economic event that usually suggests that something has gone wrong in the international supply chain.\n\nWhen fuel prices rise, the rest of the economy feels the effects. That\u2019s because transporting goods to market requires fuel for vehicles. Every recession might not be led by a sharp rise in fuel prices, but a rise in oil prices of 50% or more has nearly always been followed by a recession.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via Bianco Research Twitter, sponsored) Surge in Energy Prices Suggest High Probability of Recession.\n\nGiven the multitude of negative economic signs in the economy, it\u2019s a small wonder why the Bankrate Economic Indicator survey puts the odds of a recession by July 2024 at 59 percent.\n\nIf you\u2019re nervous about your IRA and wondering how you can protect your life\u2019s savings, you\u2019re not alone. The good news is that many investors choose to protect against economic risks by diversifying their portfolios with recession-resistant investment assets. Namely, physical assets like gold and silver have a long history of outperforming stocks, bonds, and other conventional assets during most recessions and market downturns.\n\nTo manage risk, retirement investors often choose to add precious metals such as gold to their IRAs by working with IRS-approved custodians, brokers, and storage experts.\n\nBut are you aware that you can now do this with Bitcoin too?\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin IRA?\n\nGold IRAs and Silver IRAs are retirement accounts that hold some of their value in precious metals. Bitcoin IRAs work the same way, by holding Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as an investment asset.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin IRAs have only recently become an option for investors, more and more people are electing to create one in order to diversify their portfolios and limit their exposure to systemic market risks. They also can provide impressive upside potential for those looking to make a handsome profit\u2014for instance, Bitcoin appreciated an incredible 103.95% between July 16, 2021, and November 12 of the same year.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via Statista, sponsored) The price of Bitcoin in USD from 2013-2023\n\nThroughout its history, Bitcoin prices have volleyed up and down. The Bitcoin market has enjoyed large bull runs where many investors cashed out with new fortunes, and downturns where investors were stuck waiting for the next bull run.\n\nThe key is that Bitcoin prices generally do not reflect stock market prices or have any strong relationship to economic indicators. In a way, Bitcoin operates in a world of its own. For that reason, it is often sought after as a way to spread risk around within a diversified portfolio.\n\nAccording to market research, the cryptocurrency market is growing at a rapid pace. From 2023 until 2030, the market is expected to grow at an annualized rate of about 12%. As the general appetite for Bitcoin has risen, interest in Bitcoin IRAs has grown too. Americans have flocked to these accounts as a way to chase Bitcoin\u2019s gains over the long term and to, hopefully, more rapidly grow a retirement nest egg while reducing their tax burden.\n\nBut not so fast! Before you get started with a Bitcoin IRA, there are a few things that you should know first.\n\n1. Make Sure to Use the Right Kind of IRA\n\nRemember: Bitcoin IRAs are still in their infancy, unlike Gold IRAs. Assets like gold and silver have stored value for thousands of years and could be added to IRA accounts for 25 years now, ever since the adoption of the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act. So, of course, getting your IRA ducks in a row is the first step.\n\nTraditional brokerage accounts typically do not support crypto investing. If they do, naturally, the opportunities for live trading are nil. Consider using a trusted Bitcoin IRA administrator, such as My Digital Money, to open up a Bitcoin IRA. My Digital Money was one of the first companies in the IRA market to receive a crypto trading license and one of the first to offer all major crypto assets as part of a retirement account.\n\nAn all-in-one provider such as My Digital Money can facilitate the process of creating and managing a Bitcoin IRA from start to finish. My Digital Money is also fully transparent about its fee structure, has industry-leading user privacy policies, and uses military-grade security protocols to protect its customers\u2019 assets.\n\nYou have a choice of two types of self-directed retirement accounts you can use when establishing a Bitcoin IRA:\n\nRoth Bitcoin IRA\n\nAfter-tax retirement savings account that works just like any other Roth IRA\n\nNo upfront tax deduction with contributions\n\nZero requirements to pay taxes on gains later on when you retire and begin to take distributions\n\nTraditional Bitcoin IRA\n\nTax-deferred retirement savings account\n\nContributions reduce tax liability for the year they are made (In most cases, contributions are tax-deductible)\n\nFor 2023, annual contribution limits are $6,500 if under age 50 and $7,500 if age 50 or above (add an additional $500 to each for 2024)\n\nMust pay taxes on gains when you take distributions during retirement\n\nBoth types of IRA accounts offer tax benefits. Financial advisors sometimes note that if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket at retirement than you are now, a Roth IRA may work well, since you will pay a lower marginal tax rate on your contributions today. Conversely, individuals who expect to have a lower tax liability during retirement may opt for a traditional Bitcoin IRA instead.\n\nIf you have a Bitcoin wallet for your IRA, though, you can only fund it with your IRA. It is not legal to commingle your Bitcoin wallet with other IRA funds. If you try to skirt around this, you could wind up in some serious trouble with the IRS.\n\n2. Diversification\n\nCryptocurrency is, more than anything, a diversification tool. Unlike other diversifiers, such as precious metals, Bitcoin is a highly asymmetrical investment. In other words, the upside potential (i.e., price ceiling) is much higher than the downside risk (price floor).\n\nBitcoin appears to be mimicking precious metals as a safe haven asset amid all of the geopolitical chaos in Europe. For example, during the first week of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine (Feb. 24-Mar. 1, 2022), the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed by roughly 33%.\n\n(IronMonk Solutions via Stockcharts, sponsored) Price of Bitcoin.\n\nFor better or worse, as Russia becomes more isolated economically, the ruble declines, and the rest of the world feels spillover effects from rising oil prices and inflation, crypto has a growing role in the investment market. Its decentralized qualities and seamless and borderless P2P payments have never been more crucial than now.\n\nBitcoin represents a sea change in financial systems. The existing, traditional financial infrastructure is composed of financial services firms that are tightly regulated by governments. The new financial infrastructure being created with cryptocurrencies is being built upon open-source, decentralized software that is not controlled by any organization.\n\nDigital currencies represent a $2 trillion+ market value, currently have over 200 million users, and offer a new global financial system with improved transaction efficiency. Adding exposure to this type of asset in a retirement account could be an outstanding long-term play. Perhaps that\u2019s why over 80% of central banks worldwide are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies and why the U.S. Federal Reserve is investigating a fully digital U.S. Dollar.\n\nIn 2023 so far, Bitcoin has outperformed both gold and the stock market. This is something that it has accomplished in both 2020 and 2021 as well.\n\n3. Limited Supply = Inflation Hedge\n\nFor years, according to Reuters, gold has protected investors from excessive inflation and currency debasement.\n\nAs inflation surges, the value of the dollars you earn today may not retain its purchasing power tomorrow. Throughout history, gold has consistently managed to keep up with inflation, mainly due to its status as a limited and rare resource. During periods of political or economic uncertainty, the demand for gold tends to soar as investors seek a safe haven.\n\nPresently, we find ourselves facing a dual challenge with inflation reaching a 40-year peak and witnessing the most significant invasion of a European sovereign nation since World War II. Interestingly, Bitcoin might be even more suitable for this specific context than gold ever was. Just like gold, Bitcoin is a finite resource\u2014its blockchain protocol is designed to cap the total number of coins at 21 million. This immutable supply cannot be manipulated, and unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoins cannot be arbitrarily generated by governments or central banks.\n\nNumerous respected analysts speculate that Bitcoin could potentially supplant gold\u2019s role as a reliable store of value and a long-term hedge against inflation. Ponder this: Bitcoin currently commands around 20% of the \u201cstore-of-value\u201d market. If its market share were to expand to 50% within the coming years, even without an overall increase in demand for stores of value, its price could effortlessly ascend beyond $100,000. As a result, institutional investors are increasingly turning towards Bitcoin as a safeguard against inflation.\n\n4. Resistance to Confiscation\n\nLove it or hate it, Bitcoin is decentralized and, at present, largely secure from government intervention. It is anonymous, cryptographically protected, and resistant to confiscation, theft, and seizure. Its decentralized nature provides both security from theft or fraud, as well as financial privacy.\n\nThose are some of the reasons crypto demand has skyrocketed during the Russia-Ukraine crisis.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials are now frozen out of the traditional global financial system. Assets being seized, such as offshore bank accounts, have turned the Russian economy upside down. Ordinary Russians feel the pain, too, with the ruble worth less than half a dollar and the Russian central bank setting its overnight interest rate to a sky-high 8.5%.\n\nFrom the Ukrainian side, crypto has also served a vital need. People worldwide are donating crypto to Ukraine as a form of remittance. The anonymity of crypto donations reduces the risk of Russia seizing donations.\n\n5. Know the Risks\n\nThe undeniable long-term potential of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency stands out. However, before delving into establishing an IRA, it\u2019s crucial to consider several risks.\n\nSimilar to any investment asset, Bitcoin carries its own set of risks. Its relative novelty and susceptibility to significant price swings make it vulnerable. These risks can also be magnified due to the asset\u2019s emerging nature. Being a relatively immature asset, Bitcoin is prone to volatility, erratic price movements, cyber theft, fraudulent exchanges, and an uncertain regulatory landscape.\n\nThe concept of opportunity cost applies to Bitcoin as well, much like any other potential investment. Opportunity cost means that when you allocate funds to an IRA, you forego the chance to use that limited contribution space (typically $6,000 to $7,000 annually) for other assets. Additionally, recurring custody and maintenance fees, as well as potential costs associated with crypto trades, should be considered.\n\nThe risk of \u201cforking\u201d pertains to occasions when the Bitcoin blockchain undergoes periodic modifications and updates based on a consensus among its network users. Forking events can lead to price fluctuations that may erode investor confidence.\n\nYou can take steps to mitigate investment risks. It\u2019s essential never to invest more than you can afford to lose, and it\u2019s prudent to establish a Bitcoin IRA through a reputable provider. This ensures a more secure investment journey.\n\nTop 5 Companies for Adding Crypto to Your IRA\n\nAmid the global surge of cryptocurrency, experienced investors are increasingly considering the long-term prospects of their crypto portfolios. Surprisingly, even newer investors are gravitating towards extended timeframes, regardless of their level of experience.\n\nWhile the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency taxation remains complex and subject to change, there\u2019s a fundamental aspect that remains constant. IRA accounts offer an excellent avenue for saving towards retirement or stashing funds for the long haul, coupled with the advantage of tax deductions.\n\nJust as you would with a traditional IRA through a conventional brokerage platform, there are now companies facilitating cryptocurrency investment within an IRA structure. In this article, we will explore some of the most promising options available to crypto enthusiasts who seek a tax-efficient means of long-term investment.\n\n#1 - My Digital Money\n\nURL: www.mydigitalmoney.com\n\nPhone: 833-636-2008\n\nYears in Business: 2\n\nBitcoin IRA Annual Fees: None\n\nFull-Service Bitcoin IRA: Yes\n\nInsured Bitcoin IRA?

Many saw Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a fad and little more than a gimmicky slot machine. But, now, with inflation and geopolitical tensions, we are seeing the purpose it serves in real time. It is probably no coincidence that Colorado became the first U.S. state to accept crypto for tax payments during the second week of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nWe are still in the infancy of a new asset class that could completely transform finance. The key is to look at the long-term potential and make sure that you do your due diligence. If you are a believer, there is no reason not to take the plunge and start a Bitcoin IRA.\n\nJust do your research to find a knowledgeable, reputable Bitcoin IRA provider. One decision you will have to make is whether to go with an all-in-one firm, such as My Digital Money, that handles purchasing crypto, Bitcoin IRA management, and storage, all in-house, or with a provider that merely connects you with appropriate third parties to handle custodial management and IRS-approved storage.\n\nTo find out more about how a Bitcoin IRA can work for you, consider requesting a FREE info kit from My Digital Money or give them a call at 1-833-636-2008 for more information.\n\nREQUEST FREE KIT"

        "content": "STEVENS POINT, Wis. (WSAW) - Every day it seems like scammers are getting more creative and now there is a new scam hitting Stevens Point that involves Bitcoin ATMs.\n\nHere is how the scam works:\n\nYou receive an email from PayPal saying your account has fraudulent activity, then you will be asked to make a transaction at Bitcoin.\n\nThey may ask you to transact a certain amount of money from your account, one person in Stevens Point was asked to send $16,000. If you don\u2019t answer the first call, they\u2019ll likely keep calling until you do or you do something about it.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very direct, they tell you exactly what to do, and they won\u2019t let you hang up the phone,\u201d said Lieutenant Joseph Johnson of the Stevens Point Police Department.\n\nNow, they\u2019re telling you something bad has happened, but they can fix it.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want you to hang up the phone, they want to stay on the phone with you the entire time and walk you through the process. They say if it doesn\u2019t work here, let\u2019s drive up to Weston or go somewhere else,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nThis is exactly what one victim did. Police say she really thought she had to send this money, so she went to the Bitcoin ATM and deposited $16,000, even though one UPS worker saw the red flags.\n\n\u201cThey saw people get out on their phone and go into the store for the same exact thing, so obviously they intercepted that right away and told them, \u201cHey, you\u2019re getting scammed and explained to them why and how we knew they were getting scammed because clearly, they believed in the process,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nSo, this is what you have to remember to do your research. It\u2019s okay to be curious but be prepared to end the conversation.\n\n\u201cSame number comes up ten times, answer it. You know, if you want to answer it, answer it, but then if you know, in the first five seconds or ten seconds, \u201cYeah, this doesn\u2019t seem right,\u201d you just hang up. You know that\u2019s the part that gets you is the engagement,\u201d said Director Bureau of Consumer Protection for the State of Wisconsin Michael Domke.\n\nThis is the advice Domke gives, watch the news, see what scams are out there before you give away your money.\n\nCopyright 2023 WSAW.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crypto tokens were trading higher in Wednesday's trade ahead of key US inflation data. Bitcoin (BTC) rose 1.62% to $29,727, whereas Ethereum (ETH) was above the 1,850 level.BTC volume stood at approximately $18.1 billion, rising 34.35% in the last 24 hours.\"Bitcoin\u2019s price breached the $30000 mark in the early hours of today but consolidated to trading above the $29500 level.

        "title": "CPI report may show uptick in US inflation \u2014 How will Bitcoin price react? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The S&P 500 index is currently trading only 6% below its all-time high, which was reached in January 202. Traditionally, such a situation would be seen as a bullish sign for risk-on assets, including commodities and cryptocurrencies, but this time, it appears that investors have been using the stock market as a means of protection against the recent inflation surge, which sustained at over 4% between April 2021 and May 2023.\n\nFor Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency investors, inflation has typically been viewed as a positive factor influencing the price, as evidenced by the previous all-time highs of $65,000 and $69,000 that occurred during a period of monetary expansion and increasing inflation in 2021. However, the current situation is different because inflation is making a comeback while the Federal Reserve has been effectively reducing liquidity in the system. As a result, the impact of inflation on cryptocurrencies remains uncertain.\n\nIs the tech stock bubble bursting?\n\nThe recent seven-day decline in tech giants \u2014 including Fortinet (FTNT) with a decrease of 25.7%, Block Inc. (SQ) with a drop of 20.5%, PayPal (PYPL) down by 15%, Shopify (SHOP) down 14.8% and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) down 13.9% \u2014 has caught the attention of investors, particularly in light of the expectation of an additional interest rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee on Sept. 20.\n\nEconomists predict that the Consumer Price Index for July, which will be revealed on Aug. 10, will be around 3.3%, surpassing the previous month\u2019s figure of 3% and exceeding the central bank\u2019s 2% target. Given the latest unemployment rate of 3.5% in June, nearing a 40-year low, the Fed moving toward tightening the economy becomes more certain.\n\nGold, a traditional safe haven, has struggled to surpass the $2,000 mark on multiple occasions since 2020, indicating a lack of confidence in its ability to hedge against risks.\n\nGold price in USD (blue, right) vs. S&P 500 index (orange, left). Source: TradingView\n\nThe real estate market has also been impacted, facing limited housing supply and rising mortgage rates, as evidenced by Redfin\u2019s second-quarter revenue drop of 21% compared to the previous year. The company expects a further decline of 15% to 20% in transaction value for Q3.\n\nEven traditional safe assets like bonds are losing some of their appeal due to the ongoing increase in the United States federal debt. Investment mogul and hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman reportedly shorted 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, expressing concerns about long-term inflation.\n\nA July 31 report by the U.S. Treasury Department revealed a $1 trillion quarterly net borrowing estimate and an unexpected Fitch Ratings downgrade of U.S. debt, further fueling concerns in the financial markets.\n\nConsequently, investors are now seeking alternative markets, and Bitcoin whales have increased their leverage long positions using derivatives despite the cryptocurrency\u2019s price remaining around $29,500.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price support at $29,000 is backed by solid derivatives metrics\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures typically trade at a slight premium relative to spot markets, as sellers demand more money to delay the settlement. Healthy markets usually display BTC futures contracts trading at a 5% to 10% annualized premium, a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe BTC futures premium (or basis rate) on platforms like Deribit and OKX reached 8%, the highest in over three weeks. This higher premium signals pro traders are willing to pay an additional cost to engage in leverage longs, thus reflecting a positive sentiment toward Bitcoin.\n\nTraders can also gauge the market\u2019s sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. A 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put option open interest lags the more bullish calls and is, therefore, bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, which can be deemed bearish.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe put-to-call ratio has been below 1.0 since July 24, revealing a strong demand for call (buy) instruments. Such data suggests investors' optimism for the potential price appreciation of Bitcoin.\n\nThere is a growing indication that Bitcoin might potentially benefit from the inflation surge. However, if investors start to believe that the Federal Reserve\u2019s idea of a soft landing for the economy is unlikely and that a severe recession is on the horizon, they are likely to favor Treasurys and cash positions initially.\n\nIn the short-to-mid term, there is not much evidence to suggest that Bitcoin will experience a significant surge if inflation becomes widespread in the United States. Nevertheless, there is hope for bullish investors, as the cryptocurrency has shown solid support at the $29,000 mark.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "\"I can\u2019t even believe that people would be allowed to burn tires.\"\n\nTire Fire\n\nA Pennsylvania crypto company wants to burn tires to fuel Bitcoin mining \u2014 and community members from the area surrounding the proposed blazes are furious.\n\nIn interviews with The Guardian, residents and environmentalists of Nesquehoning, the quaint Poconos township where Stronghold Digital Mining has asked the Environmental Protection Agency for permission to burn tires to generate energy for its proof-of-concept Bitcoin mining facility, spoke out about the plan.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Carol Etheridge, who lives near Nesquehoning, told the British newspaper. \"It\u2019s terrible. I can\u2019t even believe that people would be allowed to burn tires.\"\n\nBurning tires as a means to repurpose waste into energy is legal and was once, as The Guardian notes, considered an EPA-approved alternative method to conventional fossil fuels \u2014 in a now-archived page that hasn't been updated since 2016, at least. Stronghold isn't even the first company to attempt the gambit, either: back in 2017, the similarly-generic-named Standard American Mining company partnered with a tire waste reusal outfit to concoct a similar scheme in North Carolina.\n\nThat's not to say the practice is necessarily safe. As the report explains, combusting tires can release, among other byproducts, a mega-toxic type of chemical known as \"furans,\" which have been linked to cancer and have difficulty breaking down in the environment.\n\nBurn, Baby, Burn\n\nStronghold's specialty, per its website, is repurposing \u2014 first with waste coal at its two plants in PA, and now, the company hopes, with used tires.\n\nBut as local environmentalists have argued, both its waste coal programs and its proposed tire combustion plan carry significant environmental impacts.\n\n\"There is no analysis for how [burning tires] will add to the existing burden of legacy pollution in the area,\" Rob Altenburg of the environmentalist group PennFuture told The Guardian.\n\nCharles McPhedran, a lawyer with the environmental group Earthjustice, has told everyone from The Guardian and the local NPR affiliate to Cointelegraph and the Bitcoinist blog that Stronghold is bad news. As he told the British newspaper, \"this sort of disposal of tires is a last resort.\"\n\nAlthough the mining company insists on its website that it is \"actively improving the environment,\" McPhedran pointed out to Cointelegraph that both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions rose after Stronghold took over Panther Creek Energy Facility, the former coal mine in Nesquehoning where it wants to burn tires to fuel up to 15 percent of its operation. Overall, he told local NPR affiliate State Impact, the effect is similar to burning coal for energy.\n\nThe attorney and the group he represents are now calling on the state government to deny Stronghold's application to burn tires.\n\n\"Panther Creek already poses a threat to Pennsylvania\u2019s air quality,\" McPhedran told the local Times News paper. \"Considering tire-derived fuel introduces another issue.\"\n\nMore on energy: Teen Activist Lectures Greenpeace to Stop Railing Against Nuclear Power"

With PayPal\u2019s involvement, \u201cthey could end up creating a stablecoin that gives interest \u2014 which right now would be a security \u2014 that really destabilizes the banks.\u201d\n\nFink as a Spearhead\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who formerly referred to Bitcoin as a \u201cspeculative investment\u201d but has now changed his mind, is perhaps best known for spearheading the asset management industry\u2019s adoption of the digital currency.\n\nNovogratz previously claimed that Fink had supported Bitcoin as the first \u201cglobal money,\u201d giving the virtual currency additional legitimacy within the conventional financial sector.\n\nThe approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF, in Novogratz\u2019s opinion, is the opening for institutional investment into the cryptocurrency market since it will make it \u201cvery easy for people to make large allocations into the space.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Novogratz underlined Galaxy Digital\u2019s determination to vigorously compete for a part of the ETF industry, saying:\n\n\u201cOnce it\u2019s approved, we\u2019re going to fight like cats and dogs to win market share.\u201d\n\nAlso notable is \"we're going to fight like cats and dogs for mkt share\" this is something Cathie Wood brought up on ETF IQ yest too which is: All of these ETFs will basically do the same thing (hold btc) so marketing is going to be crucial and thus, heavy and prob over the top \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 8, 2023\n\nAn ETF Might Arrive Even Sooner\n\nChris Ferraro, president of Galaxy Digital, said in answer to a query that he wouldn\u2019t be shocked if the SEC ultimately approves a prospective Bitcoin ETF to avoid being branded as \u201cobstructionist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that\u2019s where the potential ETF approval comes in saying, hey, you can\u2019t call us anti-crypto, we just approved an ETF,\u201d the author commented and added the company is thus hoping that its filing will receive the same treatment.\n\nMeanwhile, depending on the outcome of Grayscale\u2019s case against the SEC, some analysts think the wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs may arrive even sooner.\n\nLast year, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC when the agency denied its request to turn its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF..\n\n\"If the SEC loses its case against @Grayscale , as we expect, the path of least resistance would be a wave of simultaneous approvals for all spot #Bitcoin ETF applicants \u2014 including Grayscale and the other eight active filings.\" @NYCStein in @Bloomberg today. Cc @EricBalchunas \u2026 pic.twitter.com/k72W6Ek7RK \u2014 Craig Salm (@CraigSalm) August 2, 2023\n\nThe path of least resistance, according to analysts , would be the simultaneous acceptance of a number of or all spot Bitcoin ETF applicants should the SEC lose its lawsuit against Grayscale.\n\nBlackRocks\u2019s Win Would Show the SEC\u2019s Confidence\n\nJeff Feng, co-founder of SEI Labs and a former Goldman Sachs analyst, commented that BlackRock obviously believes that its ETF application will allow it to keep a strong presence in international capital markets. He added that if it becomes successful, it would demonstrate the SEC\u2019s confidence in its leadership to handle the difficulties of a novel product while also legitimizing Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cGiven BlackRock\u2019s change in its position about bitcoin over the last few years, it\u2019s clear that they do not view bitcoin and tokenization as something that can be ignored as a globally traded asset,\u201d he said .\n\nThe success of the first Bitcoin Futures ETF to receive regulatory approval is proof that the first to market will probably make a fortune. Just two days after its debut, the ProShares Bitcoin ETF recorded $1.2 billion in turnover, which is the quickest an ETF has ever done so.\n\nBecause of this alleged first-mover advantage, certain businesses, like Grayscale Investments, have asked the SEC to consider all spot Bitcoin ETF applications similarly and approve them all at once, should that be their preferred course of action.\n\nA SEC\u2019s decision is anticipated this week to be made in accordance with the 45-day window starting from the date of the initial submission."

        "title": "Free Bitcoin on Zaps experiment \u2014 but what are Zaps? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A Bitcoin (BTC) advocate based in Canada has \u201cZapped\u201d 600 people a total of 300 satoshis ($0.09, or 0.000003 BTC) each in a Bitcoin-inspired social media experiment.\n\nTo date, marketing executive Michael Degroot has doled out over $50 in Bitcoin to people around the globe. He has since been Zapped back more than 40 times, receiving more than $6.\n\nDoing an experiment on @orangepillapp I\u2019m going to be zapping & connecting with everyone who has their lightning wallet attached. ~700 people, if you aren\u2019t on there already here\u2019s my referral code. https://t.co/ADO92uEDqr I\u2019ll be updating this thread while I zap people #Bitcoin \u2014 Michael Degroot (@_mikedegroot) July 31, 2023\n\nBut what are Zaps, and how is it possible to send money around the world without an intermediary?\n\nDegroot recently signed up for the Orange Pill App, a social media platform that connects Bitcoin users from around the world. The app works similarly to Tinder or Meetups, with the mission to connect Bitcoiners in real life.\n\nThe app recently integrated Zaps, or Bitcoin tips, and according to founder Matteo Pellegrini, 20% of users have added Zaps to their profiles.\n\nZaps use the layer-2 Lightning Network, which runs on top of Bitcoin. Zaps are typically small or tiny amounts of Bitcoin, measured in satoshis, that are sent peer-to-peer.\n\nTo Zap, users have two choices: create a noncustodial Lightning wallet using a Lightning node or open a custodial Lightning wallet. When users opt for a custodial solution, a third party such as Wallet of Satoshi, Blink or CoinCorner manages the Bitcoin. They take care of routing, Lightning channels and liquidity.\n\nUsers can then create a Lightning address, known as an LNURL, to receive Zaps. Think of the LNURL as an email address, but for money. By adding this address to profiles on platforms including Orange Pill App, Geyser Fund or Nostr, users can receive Bitcoin from people all around the world, instantly and at almost no cost.\n\nBitcoin tipping, or Zapping, is mobile-first.\n\nCrucially, there is seldom a Zapping middleman, and it works well with micropayments, such as Degroot\u2019s 300 sats payment. Money remitters such as PayPal, Western Union or wire transfers charge a fee to route money around the world but are ineffective for micropayments due to high fees.\n\nZapping removes the need for a middleman, which also removes a money-making opportunity. Pellegrini explained: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost us anything when users Zap each other, and we don\u2019t, nor shouldn\u2019t, make any money off it.\u201d\n\nBrian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase \u2014 the United States\u2019 largest crypto exchange \u2014 recently confused a Lightning address, or Zap address, for an email address. It\u2019s fair to say that Zaps have yet to light up the mainstream crypto conversation.\n\nZapathon\n\nBack to Degroot\u2019s Zapathon. The Canadian \u201cmessaged and zapped every single person on the Orange Pill App who has a Lightning wallet attached to their profile,\u201d he disclosed to Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cI want to contribute to the community more, and I thought this was a way I could contribute and I could increase Bitcoiners in my network. A way to find more signal.\u201d\n\nBut while Degroot expanded his network, gaining hundreds of X (formerly known as Twitter) followers, the generous act also demonstrated the power of the Lightning Network\u2019s money transfer mechanism. Degroot Zapped 300 sats (less than $0.10) to someone living 16,000 kilometers (9,940 miles) away in South Africa, expressing: \u201cIt settled in a second, and there was no fee for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to own a business, and if someone paid us with a credit card before a weekend, it could take up to five days for those funds to reach our bank account, and cost ~2.5%.\u201d\n\nDegroot also Zapped me (please note that this was not a bribe to write this article!) It cost nothing despite the fact that we are separated by the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nZapping on Nostr\n\nWhile Orange Pill App, Geyser Fund and Stacker News are Zap-arenas, the tipping feature has been increasingly popularised by Nostr, which stands for \u201cNotes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays.\u201d In its present form, Nostr is a decentralized alternative to centralized social media platforms such as X or Reddit.\n\nZaps sent on Nostr over the past six months. Source: Nostr.Band\n\nNostr is a protocol that comes to life by integrating with clients such as Damus (for iPhone) or Snort (for desktop). Nostr recently reached 4 million users, while hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin has been zapped across the world. Curiously, the \u201clike\u201d button does exist on Nostr platforms, but Zaps are sometimes favored over likes.\n\nWhy are people giving out free money on the internet?\n\nZapping is a Bitcoiner behavior that, at first glance, doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Why give out Bitcoin to strangers on the internet, knowing that it is a scarce asset? There is only 21 million BTC, or 2.1 quadrillion sats, and it\u2019s highly unlikely that more will be mined.\n\nJeff Booth, founder of Ego Death Capital, told Cointelegraph: \u201cSo for people in Bitcoin and on Nostr, that economy is emerging, and it\u2019s really early.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor people that aren\u2019t in that world, they wouldn\u2019t see what we\u2019re talking about. If you\u2019re measuring from the existing system, you don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nI asked Nostr users why they sent sats. The responses were light-hearted, fun and moving. BitcoinSandy, a Nostrich (a Nostr user), explained that \u201cit is a really good feeling sending instant value to someone likeminded who values freedom.\u201d\n\nManlikeweks explained that Nostr\u2019s borderless and censorship-resistant properties are awesome, particularly \u201cas a person based in Tanzania and being funded worldwide without any restrictions.\u201d\n\nZapping also taps into the trend of value for value, or creator compensation. Digital creators can monetize content directly, without the need for a middleman.\n\nBitcoinBarry explained how it works in practice: \u201cI often try to give answers where I can and am rewarded to give better than suboptimal answers too.\u201d I.e., if you post useful content on Nostr, you may be rewarded with a bountiful Zap \u2014 much like you would tip a waiter in a restaurant for excellent service.\n\nNostrich JoeLibertarian spelled it out: \u201cSats speak louder than likes.\u201d You can like a post on Nostr, or you can send the post sats to truly express satisfaction and gratitude.\n\nNostr-ings attached?\n\nNostr is not without hiccups. Apple recently delisted Damus from the App Store due to the Bitcoin tipping feature. Apple said Zaps violate payment policies: \u201cIf they [users] are connected to or associated with receiving digital content, they must use in-app purchase in accordance with guideline 3.1.1.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Nostr is a protocol, not a centralized service. Clients similar to Damus have since popped up on the Apple App Store, such as Plebstr.\n\nRegarding Orange Pill App, Pellegrini explained to Cointelegraph that there is no risk of being deplatformed by Apple. Why? Pellegrini explains, \u201cWe gave Tim Cook [Apple\u2019s CEO] a free Orange Pill App membership!\u201d\n\n\u201cJoking aside, there\u2019s no feed on the app, so the zapping is via profiles that are not classified as content, unlike notes/tweets.\u201d\n\nApple can continue its crusade of Nostr platforms where content can be easily monetized, but as popular Nostr creator Walker points out, Nostr is \u201ca freedom-loving hydra.\u201d If you remove one Nostr-playground, others will pop up:\n\nApple bends the knee to the CCP and removes @damusapp from the App Store in China after one day\u2026\n\n\n\nThey will soon discover #nostr is a freedom-loving hydra\u2026\n\n\n\nCut off one head and two will grow in its place.\n\n\n\nYou cannot kill it; fighting it only makes it stronger. pic.twitter.com/D3UTFtx2mR \u2014 Walker\u26a1\ufe0f (@WalkerAmerica) February 2, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, Degroot\u2019s quest continues. He hopes to Zap every user on Orange Pill App, buoyed by the enthusiasm he\u2019s met with from fellow users:\n\n\u201cMy favorite response was \u2018Thank you for sending me those sats. I have never been zapped before \u2014 you made my day!\u2019\u201d\n\nHe concluded the experiment on Aug. 7, telling the Zap-curious to \u201cDO IT.\u201d\n\nI sent ~600 zaps for a total of 180,000 sats and was zapped back ~40 times with many people telling me they would pay it forward. Had one person send me back 50x what I sent them & another 80x to support the cause. If you have the chance to zap someone for the first time DO IT\u26a1\ufe0f \u2014 Michael Degroot (@_mikedegroot) August 7, 2023\n\nUltimately, Degroot regularly Zapped profiles who received their first-ever sats. Pellegrini summed it up sweetly: \u201cAfter all, who doesn\u2019t like some sweet sweet sats?\u201d"

        "content": "Jonelle Still, the director of investigations and intelligence at CipherTrace, a Mastercard company, recently submitted a report supporting the defense in the United States v. Roman Sterlingov, a criminal case involving the Bitcoin Fog cryptocurrency mixing service.\n\nThe company\u2019s involvement in the case comes at the behest of Sterlingov\u2019s defense attorneys and includes a 41-page report detailing Still\u2019s opinion on the efficacy of data obtained by the prosecution from blockchain investigation organization Chainalysis.\n\nAt the core of the report is the assertion that data provided by Chainalysis cannot be corroborated on-chain:\n\n\u201cThe blockchain forensics and tracing tools used in this case were misused to erroneously conclude that Mr. Sterlingov was the operator of Bitcoin Fog when no such evidence exists on-chain.\u201d\n\nSterlingov has been accused by the United States government of being the founder of Bitcoin Fog, a cryptocurrency mixing service that allegedly participated in illegal money laundering transactions in the claimed amount of $336 million.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Sterlingov was arrested in April of 2021 after a 10-year investigation resulted in the allegations. According to his attorneys, the criminal claims were based on evidence provided by Chainalysis.\n\nIn a recent podcast, Sterlingov\u2019s legal representatives, Tor Ekeland and Michael Hassard, laid out the case from their perspective. They assert that Chainalysis failed to trace transactions back to their client using data and instead merely provided the prosecution with an opinion on the matter of who founded Bitcoin Fog.\n\nEkeland and Hassard claim that the government\u2019s case is built on Chainalysis\u2019 data and the assertion that in 2019 IRS agents sent a message to \u201cwhatever they think is the help desk or whatever\u201d at Bitcoin Fog asking if the service would be good to launder Bitcoin they\u2019d earned selling \u201cmolly\u201d (a street name for 3,4-methyl\u200benedioxy\u200bmethamphetamine).\n\nRelated: Darknet crypto mixer operator pleads guilty to laundering $300M in BTC\n\nThe lawyers claim that Bitcoin Fog never responded to the message and that the IRS agents went ahead and proceeded to use the Bitcoin Fog service in what the U.S. now claims was a laundering scheme. Ekeland and Hassard say the government never actually sold molly for Bitcoin (BTC) with the intent of laundering the proceeds through the Bitcoin Fog service.\n\nThe report provided by CipherTrace highlights some of the issues surrounding the Chainalysis data, including Still\u2019s opinion that the conclusions drawn from it (that Sterlingov is the founder of Bitcoin Fog) cannot be demonstrated with on-chain data.\n\nStill, the report\u2019s author ultimately concludes that \u201cBlockchain forensics should only be used to generate investigatory leads. Standing alone, they are insufficient as a primary source of evidence.\u201d The author continues to state that it is \u201cstriking\u201d that the U.S. and Chainalysis reached the conclusions they did without \u201cany corroborating evidence for the blockchain forensics.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo prevent wrongful arrests like this one,\u201d writes Still, \u201cit is recommended that Chainalysis, and their methodologies of blockchain analysis be independently audited.\u201d\n\nAs the U.S. has seized all of Sterlingov\u2019s assets while he\u2019s on trial, his defense team and CipherTrace have aided his legal efforts pro bono."

        "title": "Could Stacks Be a Multibillion-Dollar Cryptocurrency? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrencies, explosive growth is a well-known phenomenon. With tens of thousands of digital assets, identifying the next high-growth crypto with untapped long-term potential can be challenging.\n\nHowever, amid the many options, one cryptocurrency stands out as a strong contender for the next big player in the market: Stacks (STX -3.59%). Let's explore why Stacks has the potential to be the next high-growth crypto and how it could reach a multibillion-dollar valuation.\n\nBringing unique functionality to Bitcoin\n\nStacks, currently ranked as the No. 47 most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap with a valuation of about $880 million, has made significant strides since its mainnet launch in 2021. However, the project's ultimate goal is to achieve something revolutionary -- making Bitcoin (BTC -0.64%) programmable by integrating smart contracts.\n\nAs the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has always been known for its robustness and security. Still, its lack of programmability has driven developers to other blockchains to explore decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more. Stacks aims to change this narrative by unlocking the potential of Bitcoin's underlying technology and creating a bridge between the world of decentralized finance and the world's original cryptocurrency.\n\nStacks, as a Layer-2 solution, operates independently from Bitcoin's blockchain yet remains fully compatible with it and offers support for smart contracts, which form the backbone of decentralized applications. This unique architecture enables all transactions conducted on the Stacks network to eventually settle on the Bitcoin blockchain, creating a powerful connection between the two.\n\nMoreover, Stacks can read and interpret transactions happening on the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing developers to build applications that execute based on Bitcoin-based criteria. This integration opens up a new realm of possibilities, combining the security and stability of Bitcoin with the flexibility and functionality of smart contracts, paving the way for innovative and robust decentralized applications on the Stacks network.\n\nFully programmable Bitcoin is within reach\n\nStacks' Nakamoto Release represents a significant leap forward in its mission to make Bitcoin programmable and unleash its full potential. With this upgrade, developers will gain full write access to Bitcoin, and users can seamlessly utilize their native Bitcoin within the Stacks ecosystem, eliminating any counterparty risk. This groundbreaking feature is not currently in existence but once unveiled, it will represent a landmark development in Bitcoin's move into finance.\n\nFurthermore, the Nakamoto Release enhances transaction speed and security. Bitcoin's slow transaction speeds have been a limitation, but Stacks aims to address this by introducing fast blocks that can process transactions in just five seconds. In addition, the Nakamoto Release will back Stacks' blockchain with the unmatched security of Bitcoin itself. Any attempt to compromise Stacks would require hackers to breach Bitcoin's security, an incredibly formidable challenge that safeguards the Stacks ecosystem and its users.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nThe potential of Stacks is clear, as it offers unprecedented opportunities to expand Bitcoin's use cases. Considering the immense value of Bitcoin, Stacks' impact could be monumental.\n\nBy comparison, Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchains used for application development, has about 10% of its market cap used in decentralized applications. If Stacks achieves a similar level of adoption for Bitcoin, it could create an economy valued at around $60 billion in today's prices. Although Stacks' total market cap may not reach 10% of Bitcoin's, it will serve as the supporting blockchain for this new economy.\n\nA more likely target is 3% of Bitcoin's market cap, which is one of Stacks' key objectives. A 19-fold increase from today's prices would be necessary to accomplish this, leading to an impressive total valuation of nearly $17 billion. While such progress may require some time, the innovative and transformative vision of Stacks has the potential to revolutionize the world of finance.\n\nAs things stand, Stacks already represents a solid investment choice, yet with the highly anticipated Nakamoto Release on the horizon, this cryptocurrency could move to the forefront of the industry."

        "content": "Bitcoin daily\n\nBitcoin is in the midst of its best day in almost a month. It's up 2.3%, or $752 to $29,925 as it threatens to retake $30,000 for the first time in a week.\n\nThe catalyst for the buying appears to be the Moody's downgrade of several medium-sized US banks and threats to cut larger once. The Bank of New York Mellon, US Bancorp, State Street and Truist Financial were all put on review for downgrades following downgrades to 10 smaller banks.\n\n\"Many banks' second-quarter results showed growing profitability pressures that will reduce their ability to generate internal capital,\" Moody's said in a note. \"This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline, with particular risks in some banks\u2019 commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios.\"\n\nI certainly wouldn't argue with that reasoning and hold-to-maturity losses make it difficult to raise money via debt.\n\nDuring the peak of the banking troubles in March, Bitcoin made one way move to $28,000 from $20,000 and later continued to $30,000. Signs of fresh trouble are likely aiding the price action today.\n\nTechnically, Bitcoin found something of a bottom near $28,500 as it bottomed there last week and again this week. That's a sign of a double bottom that would target $31,000.\n\nIn the bigger picture, Bitcoin bulls are excited about signs of a potential ETF approval as filings continue to roll in for BTC and ETH exchange-traded products. Reports have suggested the SEC is at least open to considering allowing ETFs and that's something that would clear the way for Americans to own crypto in retirement accounts more easily.\n\nFor broader markets, strength in Bitcoin sometimes signals burgeoning optimism so there's a potential buy-the-dip mantality that could be unfolding, though I lean towards banking troubles as the main driver. The KRE US regional bank index is down 1.9%."

This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI is a new cryptocurrency platform that claims to help investors enter the volatile cryptocurrency markets with the help of intelligent software.\n\nOur guide will conduct a detailed Bitcoin 360 AI review to determine whether the platform is legit or a scam.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI Overview\n\nBefore conducting a detailed analysis of this trading platform, the below table contains a few key features of the Bitcoin 360 AI trading platform.\n\nPlatform Type Cryptocurrency trading platform Supported Cryptocurrencies BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, XRP, ADA and more Withdrawal Time 12-24 hour withdrawal times Minimum Deposit $250\n\nVisit Bitcoin 360 AI\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI \u2013 Explained\n\nBitcoin 360 AI is a new cryptocurrency trading platform that claims to offer a unique way of trading digital assets, including some of the best cryptocurrencies. According to the platform\u2019s website, Bitcoin 360 AI deploys a reliable auto-trading software, which has the capability to automatically scan the volatile cryptocurrency markets to suggest new trades and signals.\n\nBoth new and seasoned traders with less experience or time on their hands can leverage Bitcoin 360 AI\u2019s trading software to enter the cryptocurrency markets. The platform is created via cutting-edge technology, which assists in automatically scanning and navigating popular digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and more.\n\nAfter signing up for free and making a minimum deposit of $250, users can begin using the platform\u2019s trading software to open new positions. However, the lack of information and clarity on the runners of the platform makes it difficult to verify any of the claims that the Bitcoin 360 AI claims to offer.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI \u2013 Strengths & Weaknesses\n\nTo get a better understanding of some of the platform\u2019s offerings, our Bitcoin 360 AI review will discuss some of the platform\u2019s pros and cons.\n\nPros\n\nAuto Trading software that claims to directly scans the market for new crypto signals\n\nNo sign-up fees\n\nGives access to some of the largest crypto assets\n\nCons\n\nHigh minimum deposit ($250)\n\nLack of information about the platform owners\n\nVisit Bitcoin 360 AI\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin 360 AI Operate?\n\nUnlike most cryptocurrency exchanges that act as a platform to connect users with popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin 360 AI claims to take it a step further. After joining Bitcoin 360 AI, investors can access automatic trading software that can make trades on behalf of the user.\n\nAccording to its website, the Coin App 360 AI platform leverages its in-built software, which claims to have been made with advanced technology. In an effort to discover potentially profitable trades, the software constantly scans the cryptocurrency markets in real-time.\n\nAfter creating an account with Bitcoin 360 AI, users can make a minimum deposit of $250 and then choose between an auto trading feature or the manual platform option. The automatic trading feature can be set live and will begin making trades with your funds. With the manual trading feature, investors can get signals from the platform and open new trades independently.\n\nAccording to the website, the software boasts an unparalleled performance due to its ultra-modern technology. The software can scan the markets 0.01 seconds faster than any other platform, which is one of the reasons it claims to be successful. Bitcoin 360 AI also claims to boast a success rate of 99.4%, but we cannot verify these claims due to the lack of information available without creating an account.\n\nMain Features of Bitcoin 360 AI\n\nThe sections below discuss some of the main features of the Bitcoin 360 AI trading platform, as per the information on its website.\n\nHigh-Speed Trading\n\nOne of the key characteristics of Bit App 360 AI is that it boasts the ability to scan the markets at a fast speed to make new trades. According to the platform, Bitcoin 360 AI\u2019s software can scan the markets with its technology 0.01 seconds quicker than any competitor.\n\nWith the use of artificial intelligence, the software analyzes real-time market data in order to find potentially profitable trades to suggest and make on behalf of its users. Offering high levels of customization, users can simply change to an automatic trading mode with the click of a button and give the software control over their funds.\n\nDue to the ultra-rare technology that Bitcoin 360 AI claims to offer, investors can potentially earn a high yield on their investment since the success rate is suggested to be 99.4%. However, we cannot verify any of these claims at this time.\n\nDemo Account\n\nSimilar to tools like Immediate Connect and BitiCodes, another feature which Bitcoin 360 AI has is a demo account. The demo platforms can be leveraged by new customers who are looking to test out the platform features and trading modes without risking any real funds.\n\nCoin App 360 AI claims to incorporate a backtesting feature that lets investors test their future trading signals and strategies. Thus, one can get a feel of the platform and then decide whether or not to use the Bitcoin 360 AI trading bot.\n\nData Protection\n\nOn Bitcoin 360 AI, traders can be ensured that their data and trading activities will be kept private. The website claims to use advanced technology and security measures, which will be leveraged to protect sensitive information.\n\nThe platform also suggests that it adheres to all laws and regulations to protect its customers and keep the accounts safe.\n\nFast Account Set-up and Withdrawals\n\nWith Bitcoin 360 AI, investors can quickly visit the website, enter their personal details and create an account. Since there is no requirement to download any external software, investors can simply access the main software on the trading platform itself.\n\nThe platform also guarantees that fiat withdrawals will be provided within 1-2 business days. Furthermore, there are instant cashouts for cryptocurrencies.\n\nVisit Bitcoin 360 AI\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated. Trading with unregulated brokers will not qualify for investor protection.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI Fees\n\nOne of the advantages of Bitcoin 360 AI is the lack of fees that investors must provide. Along with no account creation costs, the platform does not charge a monthly subscription fee to access the software, nor does it take any commission on trades.\n\nAccount Fees $0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees $0 Commission $0\n\nWhile the low fees may be beneficial, we cannot verify these claims without making a minimum deposit of $250 and checking out the platform.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI \u2013 Is it Scam or Legit?\n\nIn the last few years, multiple cryptocurrency trading bots have emerged. In the case of Bitcoin 360 AI, the platform claims to offer a high success rate which will help investors in generating high yields.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI also suggests that new users can leverage their demo accounts to practice beforehand. However, it is hard to verify any of the claims due to the lack of transparency and information provided. The claims of a 99.6% success rate may be a marketing tactic used to generate new customers.\n\nThere have also been rumors of figures like Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Elon Musk of Tesla being involved with Bitcoin 360 AI, but these appear to be unsubstantiated.\n\nTherefore, interested readers may want to view the platform for themselves and decide whether they think Bit App 360 AI is a worthwhile software.

The platform can be accessed over email or phone calls.\n\nHow to Get Started with Bitcoin 360 AI\n\nThe sections below provide a step-by-step analysis on how to begin trading with Bitcoin 360 AI.\n\nStep 1: Visit the Bitcoin 360 AI Website\n\nHead over to the Bitcoin 360 AI website and begin completing the registration box at the top of the page.\n\nInvestors must provide their full names, email addresses, and phone numbers to get started.\n\nStep 2: Make a Minimum Deposit\n\nAfter creating an account, you must make a minimum deposit o at least $250 or more.

However, our research found nothing of substance in this regard.\n\nDoes Elon Musk Use Bitcoin 360 AI?\n\nElon Musk might be a Dogecoin hypeman, but his stand towards other assets, including Bitcoin, is that of animosity.

So, no, there is no evidence supporting the claims stating that Elon Musk Uses Bitcoin 360 AI.\n\nDoes Jeff Bezos Use Bitcoin 360 AI?\n\nWhile Jeff Bezos once had good words to say about cryptocurrency, there is no detail exists of his crypto trades. So no, Jeff Bezos has shown no inclination to use Bitcoin 360 AI.\n\nDoes Martin Lewis Use Bitcoin 360 AI?\n\nMartin Lewis, a financial journalist, has shown no interest in crypto trading platforms like Bitcoin 360 AI. Also, there is no evidence to support that he does.\n\nBitcoin 360 AI Review Conclusion\n\nThis guide has reviewed Bitcoin 360 AI \u2013 a new crypto trading platform that claims to deploy an in-built trading software to generate new trades in real-time.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether rise; Solana leads post-PayPal stablecoin launch rally; several US banks downgraded - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Wednesday morning in Asia to trade above US$29,700. Ether also logged gains along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. Solana led the winners with an almost 5% jump. The crypto rally followed PayPal\u2019s launch of a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin on Monday. That coincided with a sharp drop in global government bond yields Tuesday after the release of China\u2019s weaker-than-expected economic data. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged higher on increased trading volumes, while U.S. stock futures traded lower as ratings agency Moody\u2019s downgraded several mid-size U.S. banks.\n\nCryptos rally\n\nBitcoin rose 2.02% in the last 24 hours to US$29,764.75 as of 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong and moved up 0.41% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency briefly breached the US$30,000 resistance level on early Wednesday morning.\n\nEther gained 1.61% to US$1,855.88 but was still down 0.82% over the past seven days. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher, with Solana\u2019s SOL leading the winners. The token rose 4.93% to US$24.19 and logged a weekly gain of 1.07%.\n\nThe crypto market received a boost from global payment giant PayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch on Monday. Known as PayPal USD (PYUSD), the stablecoin will allow users in the U.S. to make transfers to compatible external wallets, pay other customers and purchase foreign currencies using the token.\n\n\u201cPayPal\u2019s stablecoin launch is an important development for crypto within the U.S. Although the initial launch is limited, with PayPal\u2019s size and global reach, it is likely to impact global stablecoin usage and adoption going forward,\u201d said William Cai, co-founder and managing partner at U.S.-based asset management firm Wilshire Phoenix.\n\n\u201cIt is another clear signal of institutional confidence that crypto isn\u2019t going away and will emerge from this \u2018crypto winter\u2019 stronger,\u201d added Cai. \u201cStablecoin is the grease of the crypto markets. Overall increase in stablecoin market cap will coincide with a major upward trend in crypto prices.\u201d\n\nGreta Yuan, head of research at Hong Kong-headquartered digital asset exchange VDX, said that while it is not the first time major institutions have entered the stablecoin space, previous attempts met with substantial regulatory obstacles.\n\n\u201cThe recent progress of a bill aimed at establishing a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, coupled with PayPal\u2019s deep expertise in the payment industry, has the potential to set up PayPal for a more promising growth path,\u201d Yuan added\n\nMeanwhile, Ark Invest Chief Executive Officer Cathie Wood said in a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg that she expected the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve multiple spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) at the same time.\n\nThere is now a growing sense of optimism that successful ETF applications from major U.S. asset managers including BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Wisdom Tree could be the start of large-scale institutional investment in the digital asset space.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Mike Novogratz, CEO of investment management firm Galaxy Capital, reportedly said via conference call that the SEC\u2019s approval of a Bitcoin ETF was likely a matter of \u201cwhen, not if.\u201d Issuers of Bitcoin ETF would, he said, \u201cfight like cats and dogs to win market share\u201d once they received approvals.\n\n\u201cThis could have caused the 3-4% rally in Bitcoin prices overnight,\u201d said Markus Thielen, Head of Research & Strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport.\n\n\u201cA common pattern is emerging where Bitcoin prices tend to rally during US trading hours but retrace during Asian trading hours,\u201d Thielen added. \u201cNevertheless, Bitcoin is still in a trading range but a potential SEC approval could push prices higher.\u201d\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 1.71% in the past 24 hours to US$1.18 trillion, while trading volume moved up 9.37% to US$36 billion.\n\nSome pep in the step for NFTs\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index inched up 0.14% in the past 24 hours to 2,483.18 as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still down 0.90% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum NFT index also logged gains, while the Solana, Polygon and Cardano indexes dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume surged 64.03% in the past 24 hours to over US$20.4 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volume on the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains all also logged increases, while the Bitcoin blockchain saw a drop.\n\n\u201cAgain we\u2019re in the green and suddenly there\u2019s a little pep in traders\u2019 step,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really beginning to see the type of NFTs that do well in this market, which is cheaper NFTs with high volume. DMarket, Gods Unchained, Sorare and DraftKings all represent a form of gaming, all are pretty darn affordable, and all have thousands of traders. This is what the future of NFTs will really look like,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nAmong NFT collections, Polygon-based DraftKings saw the largest 24-hour sales volume. It rose 26.23% to over US$4.12 million for 85% of total NFT trading volume on the Polygon network. The collection is based on sports and betting company DraftKings\u2019 NFT games.\n\nForkast Labs\u2019 Petscher said that Paypal\u2019s stablecoin launch is providing a timely boost for the NFT industry. The global payment giant could prove successful in onboarding those unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies into the NFT space, he said Tuesday in a video uploaded to Youtube.\n\n\u201cGive them some PayPal stablecoin and then watch OpenSea integrated, and then let them buy Starbucks NFTs on secondary with their PayPal stablecoins,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cThis is huge for the world of crypto and it\u2019s huge for NFTs. This is what building looks like.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, NFTs are seeing growing interest in the art space.\n\nU.K.-based NFT platform ElmonX announced Wednesday that it will partner with international image licensing company Bridgeman Images to mint \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d \u2014 a painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci \u2014 as NFT collectibles. The painting was sold for US$$450.3 million at the Christie\u2019s auction house in 2017, making it the most expensive artwork ever sold.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci's masterpiece: Salvator Mundi \ud83d\udd2e\n\n\n\nRediscovered, restored, and auctioned for a record-breaking USD 450,312,500 in 2017, making it the world's most expensive artwork ever sold \ud83d\udcc8\n\n\n\nTwo digital collectibles drop Saturday 12th August 9AM PT only on\u2026 pic.twitter.com/nAppalhFSC \u2014 ElmonX (@elmonx_official) August 8, 2023\n\nElsewhere, Chinese artist Yue Minjun on Tuesday launched Kingdom of the Laughing Man \u2014 a collection of unique NFTs based on his artworks \u2014 on NFT platform LiveArt. The collection has logged a 24-hour sales volume of over US$978,000 and sits third in Crypto Slam\u2019s sales volume rankings, right behind Bored Ape Yacht Club.\n\nU.S. equities drop on bank downgrades, China records annual decline\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 11:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures moved higher. The U.S. stock market closed lower on Tuesday.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes were also mixed on Wednesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and Japan\u2019s Nikkei logged losses, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose.\n\nOn Tuesday, Moody\u2019s Investor Service lowered the credit rating of 10 small and midsize U.S. banks citing funding risks and weaker profitability. The ratings agency warned that it could downgrade several other major U.S. lenders including U.S. Bancorp, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and State Street Corp.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a big deal in the bigger picture of how the economy operates, because regional banks\u2019 lending is one of the main lubricants of the economy,\u201d said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at asset manager Glenmede, in a Reuters report published Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIf it slows down, the engine just doesn\u2019t work as well,\u201d Pride added.\n\nAll eyes are now on the release of U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data on Thursday. Bloomberg analysts expect the core CPI to rise 0.2% in July, which would be the smallest monthly increase in the past two and a half years.\n\nOn the U.S. inflation front, the Federal Reserve meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates.\n\nThe rate now stands at between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 86.5% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September, and a 13.5% chance the Fed will raise rates by a further 25-basis-points.\n\nMeanwhile in China, the country\u2019s July CPI posted an annual decrease of 0.3%. The Producer Price Index (PPI) also dropped 4.4% year-on-year, Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday.\n\nThe dip in July CPI data represents China\u2019s first annual decline since February 2021. However, the drop was smaller than the analysts\u2019 expectation of 0.4%.\n\n\u201cChina is in deflation, for sure, the question is for how long.\u201d Robin Xing, chief China economist for Morgan Stanley, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the policy makers how they react.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "title": "BItcoin: Navigating Economic Shifts and Financial Challenges - Coinbase",
        "content": "Summary In an environment where many global central banks are still tightening rates, it may seem premature to talk about structural shifts towards disinflation. Yet, in the US at least, we no longer seem to be beleaguered by persistent inflation fears, while the country appears to be enjoying steady economic growth, courtesy of the government\u2019s expansionary fiscal policy. Generative artificial intelligence promises greater long-run productivity and cheaper goods, which may also put a cap on inflation in the future but potentially downsize workforces. We believe that such conditions may warrant the need for loose monetary policies in the long term. Not only will central banks have to manage the supply-demand misalignments that contribute to price instability, but second order objectives may become more meaningful. Worker displacement will need to be offset by new job creation. More government expenditures will mean more borrowing which will need to be offset by lower rates to reduce the costs of debt service. All things being equal, we think that the potential combined effect of expansionary fiscal and monetary policy should support bitcoin in the long term. That is, bitcoin is not only a technologically innovative instrument but a financially innovative one. Its unique properties (as a globally accessible, decentralized supranational asset with a fixed supply) may offer relative stability against the shifting tides of fiat debasement and profligate spending. Moreover, crypto allocations can diversify fund managers\u2019 exposure to uncommon sources of risk in traditional \u201cbalanced\u201d equity vs bond portfolios.\n\nThe long bitcoin story About a year ago, the biggest concern for the macroeconomic environment was that inflation was so persistent that it wasn\u2019t clear that even manufacturing a recession would be enough to bring it down. That\u2019s a far cry from where we are today, where at least in the US, inflation seems to be under control and economic growth has been steady. Note that we are seeing some divergence between what\u2019s happening in the US compared to the rest of the world, mostly because of expansionary US fiscal policy. But overall, energy price shocks have subsided, real wage growth is negative and global supply chains are once again facilitating the supply of cheap goods. The biggest fear that many had last year was that the price alignments stemming from the pandemic were structural. That didn\u2019t seem entirely outlandish at the time because it seemed to cap off a multi-year trend of de-globalization and near-shoring. The economic era of cheap stuff seemed to be over. Instead, prudence in the eurozone helped relieve anxiety over gas shortages alongside a mild winter. Economic activity in China has slowed materially, and its stockpiling of crude oil has moderated. The value of its exports in USD terms is down for the third straight month by 14.5% YoY (July), which may incentivize the country to boost production. China\u2019s producer price index (PPI) fell 4.4% YoY last month, which may also be a precursor to lower US prices in the months ahead. Meanwhile, generative artificial intelligence (AI) may be a game changer for the world\u2019s future economic prospects. Generative AI promises to raise productivity, lower input costs and possibly moderate the size of workforces going forward. Goldman Sachs reported in late March that around two-thirds of current occupations are exposed to AI task automation and as much as a quarter to half of all work tasks. That is, AI has the potential to displace hundreds of millions of jobs at scale, while signaling a structural shift towards cheaper goods \u2013 possibly putting a ceiling on inflation. The implications of such a trend is that central banks may need to retain loose monetary policy to avert the misalignment between supply and demand. Keeping people in jobs (i.e. maximum sustainable employment) is a part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s dual mandate as well as a secondary objective for the European Central Bank. Loose monetary policy may also be required because overall government spending is increasing. For example, in the US, the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act represent US$2.1T in new expenditures over the next few years. The US government pays for this via higher taxes but more importantly, higher borrowing. In fact, the Treasury Department recently announced an increase in its supply of new issuance \u2013 boosting its net borrowing for 3Q23 alone from $733B to $1T. Very likely, we believe the Fed will need to maintain an expansionary stance in order to manage this debt burden in a sustainable way over the long run or otherwise risk a potential debt crisis. That is, they will need to lower rates or use quantitative easing to reduce the costs of servicing this debt over the long term. Structurally, we think all of this favors a long bitcoin world.\n\nWhat, me worry? What distinguishes bitcoin as a financially innovative instrument is that bitcoin is a globally accessible, decentralized supranational asset with a fixed supply. This is distinct from bitcoin being a technologically innovative instrument due to its cryptographic ability to facilitate trustless, tamper-proof transactions. In our view, what bitcoin represents as a financial instrument makes it an exceptional hedge for excessive fluctuations in money supply and falling real rates. To be clear however, we don\u2019t necessarily believe that increases in the global supply of fiat currency must translate to uncontrollable rises in the price level of goods and services. The dramatic increase in the M2 money supply in the early stages of the pandemic pressured the multilateral USD index level lower, weakening the currency\u2019s safe haven properties but leaving inflation mostly subdued at the time. (The effects of money supply growth may operate with variable lags.) Higher rates (or the prospect of higher rates) in 2022 then precipitated the USD\u2019s recovery, raising confidence in its reserve status at a time when real incomes were being eroded. We believe that bitcoin\u2019s weak performance last year was more a response to such effects of central bank tightening and the withdrawal of liquidity around the world, and not strictly to upside inflationary pressures. Moreover, the selloff in bitcoin followed a major fiscal regime shift in 2020-21 which had been triggered by the pandemic. Modern monetary theory (MMT) was employed in earnest during that time as countries responded to a unique, once-in-a-lifetime health crisis. That led many countries to spend without scrutinizing the long-term effects on debts and deficits. During this time, bitcoin played a dual role. Not only did it represent an alternative to the traditional financial system, but it operated as an important portfolio diversifier because of its low-to\u2013negative correlation to stocks and/or bonds at that time. See chart 2. That dynamic shifted last year for two separate but interrelated reasons. First, as more buyers accumulated bitcoin, the macro developments that informed their allocation decisions for the traditional financial instruments in their portfolios also impacted the non-traditional assets in their portfolios (including but not limited to cryptocurrencies). Second, and perhaps more importantly, the magnitude of the market distress in 2022 represented such a unified fundamental theme that it led investors to become more single-minded about their allocations. These factors are what we believe led to a rise in the correlation between crypto and other asset classes. Over the course of 2023, that correlation has declined sharply to a coefficient of 0.10 based on bitcoin and S&P 500 daily returns over a 90-day window. This suggests that these variables have little-to-no relationship at the moment, as the factors driving digital asset performance are once again more endogenous rather than exogenous to the crypto ecosystem. Moreover, in a recent study , we\u2019ve found that crypto allocations can diversify fund managers\u2019 exposure to uncommon sources of risk in traditional \u201cbalanced\u201d equity vs bond portfolios. That is, our multi-factor risk model shows that adding cryptocurrencies to a portfolio can increase the diversification benefits from a systematic risk perspective. Not only that, but these contributions to factor diversification tend to rise at a faster than linear pace.\n\nNew rates, new challenges Keep in mind too that the current era of high global interest rates is a limiting factor on the available universe of instruments for investors. The higher cost of capital reduces earnings expectations, for example, which partly explains why the total global equity market cap fell from $121.5T at the end of 2021 to $97.6T at the end of 2022, according to Bloomberg. Over the same period, SIFMA reports that the total outstanding of global fixed income markets fell from $134.1T to $129.8T. Among the higher yielding instruments, the size of the junk bond market is down nearly 10% from its 3Q21 highs to $1.42T, while high-yield loans are not faring much better. During the pandemic, the private credit market benefited from those declines, rising from $1T to $1.55T. But now, opportunities in private markets are starting to be impacted as well. Large asset management portfolios are already loaded up on private equity allocations, and fundraising is down 35% compared to mid-year 2022, according to Bain & Co . Moreover, not only has dealmaking slowed down, but defaults on the leveraged loans used to finance corporate buyouts are on the rise. According to Deutsche Bank , credit losses are expected to pick up in 2H23 then increase sharply next year with a peak in defaults anticipated in 4Q24. That said, more banks like JP Morgan and Bank of America believe that the US may avert a recession altogether in this cycle, which may temper such harsh credit loss forecasts. In our view, it\u2019s still too early to tell, as the line between a recession and a soft landing is fairly thin. Even if a US recession is avoided, chances are we may nevertheless see subpar growth next year. Plus, we think that despite the Fed\u2019s efforts (via liquidity backstops, for example), US regional banks continue to look fragile. As recently as August 7, ratings agency Moody\u2019s (1) downgraded the credit ratings of ten mid-sized US banks, (2) are reviewing six banks for downgrade and (3) put a negative outlook on eleven of the nation's largest lenders. In fact, we believe that investor concerns surrounding an approaching credit \u201cmaturity wall\u201d in 2H24 or 1H25 could increase excess demand for alternatives like bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies as a means of diversifying the concentration of credit risk in existing portfolios. Such developments may also coincide with the approval of one or more spot bitcoin ETF(s) in 1Q24 as well as the bitcoin rewards halving in 2Q24, both of which are events that we believe could support increased adoption overall."

        "content": "I think it is time to launch a website of cryptoscams so yes, I\u2019ve done it. It\u2019s called cryptocrim.com, a space where all the crypto criminals will be thrown into Room 101, a place where you can consign anything you hate to history (although George Orwell had other ideas).\n\nThe new site will be live soon and the reason for launching this site is that, after so many crypto scams and rip-offs, I\u2019ve decided to keep a shortlist of updates of those that are the worst or the greatest. The list will include Celsius, TerraUSD-Luna, FTX, MtGox, Three Arrows Capital, Quadriga, OneCoin and more \u2026 but, as it\u2019s just starting, let\u2019s begin with bitcoin Bonnie and crypto Clyde.\n\nWho?\n\nA married couple nicknamed \u201cBitcoin Bonnie and Crypto Clyde\u201d have pleaded guilty to laundering $4.5 billion (\u00a33.5bn) in stolen cryptocurrency.\n\nMore detail emerges:\n\nHeather Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein were arrested in New York last year after police linked their lavish lifestyle to a crypto heist, in what the US Justice Department called its \u201clargest financial seizure ever\u201d. The Justice Department managed to recover \u00a32.8bn out of the stash of some 120,000 bitcoin, which is today worth \u00a33.5bn. Prosecutors said the pair stole the bitcoin in 2016 using \u201cadvanced hacking tools\u201d.\n\nAs part of a deal, the pair pleaded guilty to money laundering, while Lichtenstein admitted to being behind the hack and Morgan pleaded guilty to an additional count of conspiracy to defraud the US.\n\nDespite her moves to hide her crimes, Morgan masqueraded as a rapper and tech entrepreneur who called herself a \u201cbad-ass money maker\u201d and \u201cthe crocodile of Wall Street\u201d in her lyrics.\n\nHeather and husband Ilya were running a crypto scam firm called Bitfinex. Folks investing bitcoin in Bitfinex did not know that the couple converted the investments into US dollars clearly in the light of day. It was purely a hack flow where money went directly from the firm into their pockets. The pair also purchased gold coins and set up shell companies to make the bitcoin funds look legitimate.\n\nSo, how did they get found out?\n\nWell, they accidentally exposed themselves by using a gift card paid for with the stolen funds from Bitfinex, when paying for goods in a Walmart supermarket.\n\n\u201cPolice were able to link the Walmart gift cards back to some of the proceeds of the Bitfinex hack, which then opened up the further investigation,\u201d said Jonathan Levin, founder of cryptocurrency investigators Chainalysis, who participated in the investigation.\n\nAmazing.\n\nI guess there are two questions:\n\n1) How did they get away with it?\n\nProsecutors claimed the couple used fake identities to create online accounts and disguise their trail of transactions by depositing and withdrawing the stolen funds from virtual exchanges and darknet markets.\n\n2) Why Bonnie and Clyde?\n\nThere are few couples who have made headlines in quite the same way as Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. The two criminals are known for a series of bank robberies, murders, and kidnappings that took place between 1932 and 1934, the height of the Great Depression.\n\nSo, welcome to 2023 where bitcoin Bonnie and crypto Clyde strike again."

Discover SCENE\n\nA friendly new protocol has just dropped on the ever-expanding Ordinals ecosystem. Dubbed .frens, the project brings the social aspect of Bitcoin onto its immutable blockchain.\n\nSpawning from the decade-old meme term fren\u2013which means friend\u2013the .frens protocol is designed to build a social graph on Bitcoin where users declare their social connections via Ordinals Inscriptions. The protocol also relies on an indexing feature that creates a reputation score depending on how many interactions a particular address has\u2014a measure of social capital.\n\nThe protocol shares its name with many other unrelated projects, including a Fren Protocol deflationary pepecoin token, a Frens Protocol oracle API, and a Frenz NFT metaverse. But the .frens protocol\u2014which relies on the Ordbit inscription service\u2014is the only one focused on social connections.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMaking friends and networking is key in real life and the digital domain,\u201d said the protocol\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Doggfather, with the latter type of interaction mostly happening on Twitter. He explained to Decrypt, however, that on the centralized Twitter platform, accounts and handles get seized daily, proving that \u201cyou don\u2019t own your network or audience on Web2 platforms.\u201d\n\nFor Doggfather, the new .frens protocol ecosystem \u201cis a way to use Ordinals to come closer to the Web3 ethos of a decentralized social network on Bitcoin.\u201d As he told Decrypt, \u201cyou own your .frens soulbound token.\u201d\n\nVitalik Buterin once proposed Soulbound Tokens (SBT), a non-transferable token that represents credentials and affiliations within DeSoc\u2014decentralized society\u2014and are linked to Souls, a type of address that establishes provenance.\n\nDoggfather uses the same vernacular as Ethereum\u2019s creator, writing in his exhaustive and elaborate .frens guide that Soulbound tokens are blockchain-based tokens representing a person\u2019s characteristics, features, traits, and achievements.\n\nHe contrasts them with Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), delineating that these cannot be transferred from your soul, or wallet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Jake Gallen, head of NFT strategy and product at Emblem, introducing .frens as SBTs on Ordinals means they are \u201cabsent of speculative principles.\u201d He told Decrypt that \u201cit's going to take some time for it to become adopted but has the ability to be a cornerstone protocol of the non-financialized sector of Ordinals.\u201d\n\nThe use-cases are plentiful, Doggfather said.\n\n\u201cOnce the .frens network reaches a critical network size, it will become a robust reputation signal to the Ordinals and Bitcoin community,\" he explained. \u201cUsers with high .frens scores will have cheaper DeFi loans, need to pledge less collateral, and their Ordinals collection drops will achieve better primary and secondary market outcomes.\"\n\nAlthough the .frens protocol remains in private beta, allowing Doggfather and his team to sort out the kinks and test the network, the creator predicts a bullish trend for anything Ordinals-related.\n\n\u201cWhether it's the .frens protocol, metaverse projects, or digital identities, these projects will outlive us,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cWe are experiencing history in the making.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin and other top crypto tokens were mostly higher on Wednesday ahead of the key economic data due later this week. The entire narrative for Bitcoin has shifted towards the Bitcoin ETF, which is less volatile of late as the $30,000-mark is a critical threshold. But macros continue to weigh.\n\n\n\nBitcoin was back in action on Wednesday as the largest crypto token gained more than 2 per cent to regain 29,500-mark. However, its largest peer, Ethereum was trading higher, rising more than a per cent but could not race past $1,850-levels. Price action in the major altcoins was on the higher side.\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s prices crossed $30,000 before settling at trading above the $29,500 level. This shift might be because of China's reduced trade figures for July and the US 10-year Treasury yield dropped. Over the past 24 hours, Solana, Shiba Inu, Hedera, and TonCoin gained Ethereum continuing trading between the $1,800-$1,900 range, said Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder at Mudrex.\n\n\n\nBarring a few exceptions, all top crypto tokens were trading higher on Wednesday. Shiba Inu and Solana gained more than 5 per cent each, while Polygon gained 4 per cent. XRP rose 3 per cent, whereas Cardano, Polkadot and Litecoin added 2 per cent each. Among the losers, Bitcoin Cash and Tron were about a per cent each.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly higher, rising up to $1.19 trillion-mark as it rose as much as 2 per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes surged about 13 per cent to $36.67 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nPolygon (MATIC) is experiencing a positive break following wider sentiment in the market postPaypal\u2019s new stablecoin news. The asset is showing signs of recovery suggesting a breakout from the descending channel.If successful, MATIC could hit the key 100-day moving average around the $0.80 area.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts RSI reading is currently at 45.7 and has started moving sideways, indicating that the asset may recover towards neutral territory. However, if MATIC is unable to break through the $0.75 barrier, price may fall. The most recent low (about $0.65) serves as an early support level.\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $0.65, $0.55\n\nResistance: $0.75, $0.80, $0.90\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "title": "Worldcoin explained: Everything you need to know - TechTarget",
        "content": "AI continues to grow at a furious pace. While there are many benefits to AI, such as time saving and writing prompts, there are also some challenges and dangers, including deepfakes and fraud.\n\nOn July 24, 2023, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman introduced Worldcoin as a new cryptocurrency that offers a new and unique method for identification to reduce the risk of fraud, and all eyes are on it -- literally.\n\nThe new cryptocurrency determines \"personhood\" with a scan of the eyes, helping to prove someone is a person and not a robot.\n\nWhat is Worldcoin? Altman, along with Alex Blania and Max Novendstern, co-founded the cryptocurrency initiative and online platform known as Worldcoin. It combines AI technologies with cryptocurrencies and blockchain in an open source protocol to give anyone access to a global economy. Worldcoin is decentralized, like other cryptocurrencies, which means the decisions are made by users and not a centralized entity, such as a bank. It took two years to develop this project. It seeks to address income inequality through a unique World ID. The World ID proves that someone is a person and not some form of bot or AI. There are three parts to this project: A unique digital identity to be used globally. A global currency via Worldcoin tokens. An app for payments, transfers and purchases using cryptocurrency or traditional assets. Learn more about the pros and cons of cryptocurrency.\n\nHow does Worldcoin work? Worldcoin is different from other popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, because it offers people a token for the future without requiring any investment funds upfront. The Worldcoin project aims to help create a global economy for all, regardless of country or economic status. To get Worldcoin, people need to scan their eyes through a sphere-shaped device called the Orb to ensure everyone is human and only signs up once. The unique identifier is taking center stage as AI continues to grow, and proving someone is a person versus a machine is vital with the rise of AI. Irises are distinct for each person, similar to fingerprints. The iris structure of the subject's eyes is used by the Orb to generate a special identifying code that serves as the person's unique identifier. The code is then saved on the Worldcoin decentralized blockchain to prevent others from replicating the code. The scans are anonymized so they cannot be traced to that person after the identifier is created. Here are the main differences between a decentralized blockchain and a centralized blockchain. Worldcoin uses a decentralized blockchain. The Orb does not store biometric data but does keep an IrisHash, which is a set of generated numbers to identify the person based on their scan. After a person receives their IrisHash and crypto wallet, they get their World ID or digital passport. People can find an Orb center for scanning in facilities across 35 countries. The Orb is about the size of a bowling ball and conducts iris scanning in-person at these centers. There are Orbs in several large cities in Africa, Asia, Europe, South America and North America, including locations in New York and California. Check out Orb locations here.\n\n3 steps for Worldcoin To complete the Worldcoin process, there are three steps: Download World App. Users can create a Worldcoin account and obtain a crypto wallet called WalletConnect to link to other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and more conventional currencies, such as stablecoins. WalletConnect also works with social media apps, such as Instagram and X.\n\nUsers can create a Worldcoin account and obtain a crypto wallet called WalletConnect to link to other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and more conventional currencies, such as stablecoins. WalletConnect also works with social media apps, such as Instagram and X. Sign up for World ID. Users can use World App without the World ID, but they cannot get the free share of Worldcoin tokens without visiting a Worldcoin Operator center and scanning their iris with the Orb to verify identity.\n\nUsers can use World App without the World ID, but they cannot get the free share of Worldcoin tokens without visiting a Worldcoin Operator center and scanning their iris with the Orb to verify identity. Receive a free share of Worldcoin and other digital currencies. A person can use their World ID in World App to get their free Bitcoin and Ethereum airdrops after confirming their distinct identity. In countries where Worldcoin tokens are available, users enter their World ID to claim their free tokens.\n\nUser privacy concerns There have been concerns from both regulators and privacy advocates with the collection of Worldcoin's data, including users' informed agreement to having one business handle all their data. According to Worldcoin, its project is entirely confidential since the biometric data is either erased or stored in an encrypted format. There are concerns that the iris scans will be available to purchase on the black market, enabling people to gain access to Worldcoin accounts."

        "content": "The crypto market is going through an exceptionally calm phase as various volatility indicators are approaching their lowest recorded levels.\n\nAmidst this tranquil environment, it is unlikely that this week\u2019s CPI data will substantially impact the optimistic outlook for Bitcoin. However, in the event of an unexpected negative surprise, such as the CPI surpassing expectations by a significant margin, there might be concerns that higher interest rates could lead to a decline in Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nMacro Scene\n\nWe anticipate this week to be eventful, with significant data releases and notable developments in cryptocurrency. Market watchers will closely monitor the July CPI Inflation data and Jobless Claims figures on Thursday. Friday will bring insights from the July PPI Inflation and Consumer Sentiment data.\n\nMoreover, this week will feature three Federal Reserve members speaking and approximately 15% of S&P 500 companies reporting their earnings.\n\nDe-Risking from MakerDAO\n\nOn the bearish side, concerns persist about stablecoins, particularly DAI. On-chain analysis indicates that a16z, a long-time MakerDAO investor, sold their last MKR holdings last week, leading to speculation that significant events may be on the horizon.\n\nThere are also signs of de-risking from MakerDAO by Circle or related entities, as the amount of USDC backing the DAI in circulation has significantly decreased in recent weeks. It might explain the selling pressure on USDC. These concerns could affect DAI and USDC, leaving GUSD and USDT in focus. GUSD had a hard time holding its peg due to 83% of it being used to back DAI, while USDT faces speculative possibilities surrounding regulatory issues.\n\nPossible DOJ Charges against Binance\n\nOne concerning story from this week is the report that the Department of Justice (DOJ) is contemplating filing criminal fraud charges against Binance. Moreover, there is concern that doing so could trigger a run on the exchange. Despite already facing lawsuits from the SEC and CFTC, criminal charges would be a significant escalation.\n\nBase And Meme Coin Mania\n\nOn the bullish side, Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum layer 2, Base, is set to launch publicly. The ability to bridge crypto both ways may create increased demand for ETH and ERC-20 tokens.\n\nAdditionally, there might be a resurgence of meme coin mania on Base, as observed on the platform so far. It\u2019s worth noting that some of these meme coins are rug pulls, and how Coinbase handles such issues will be intriguing. Barring any regulatory warnings or interventions, Base could potentially achieve the same level of success as BNB did in its early days. As always, DYOR!\n\nPositive Catalyst from Hong Kong Crypto Exchanges\n\nAnother positive catalyst comes from the recent approval granted to two crypto exchanges, Hashkey and OSL, to serve retail investors in Hong Kong. Initially, they will reportedly offer BTC and ETH. Hashkey may also include USDT and USDC, which is surprising given the regulator\u2019s stance on stablecoins being off-limits to retail investors. The restriction is likely to prevent capital flight from the mainland, a concern shared by China\u2019s new central bank governor.\n\nDespite these promising developments, the current low Google Search Trends for Bitcoin and Ethereum in Hong Kong suggest that retail investors are not actively buying BTC and ETH yet. However, the situation could change swiftly if another bullish catalyst emerges.\n\nFor now, bearish catalysts dominate the market, with many of these concerns centered around DeFi platforms.\n\nCurve Saga\n\nLast week, Curve Finance, a prominent DeFi protocol, experienced a significant setback with panic selling and withdrawals hitting hard. In just 48 hours, the TVL in Curve dropped by 50%, going from $3.2 billion to $1.6 billion, and its native CRV token saw a sharp decline of over 30%, falling from $0.73 to $0.50.\n\nThe catalyst for this crisis was a hack that exploited a dormant zero-day vulnerability present in older versions of Vyper, a third-party EVM contract-oriented, Pythonic programming language utilized by Curve and other DeFi protocols.\n\nHow Did It Happen?\n\nThe attack unfolded in two stages. On July 30th, hackers exploited pools on Curve, including Alchemix (alETH), Pendle (pETH), CurveDAO (CRV), and Metronome (mSETH), stealing around $70 million worth of assets. Following this, the CRV/ETH pool faced a second attack, capitalizing on the broken balances left behind by the initial exploit. It allowed the hackers to exchange CRV for most of the remaining ETH in the pool.\n\nImpact on the DeFi Ecosystem\n\nThe ramifications of the Curve Finance exploit extended beyond the protocol itself, impacting the broader DeFi ecosystem. It was partially due to the $100 million loan taken by Curve\u2019s founder, which was secured using the platform\u2019s native Curve DAO token. Fortunately, a white hat hacker, c0ffeebabe.eth, intervened and returned approximately $5.4 million to Curve by front-running one of the attacker\u2019s transactions.\n\nControversy and Aftermath\n\nThe losses from the exploit amounted to nearly half of the approximately $70 million in stolen assets, primarily originating from the CRV/ETH pool.\n\nPlease note that this reentrancy issue is associated with the use of 'use_eth', which could potentially place the WETH-related pools in jeopardy! @CurveFinance , please DM us if you need any help. https://t.co/vjc1RRce7w pic.twitter.com/Wz8DXJZK7Y \u2014 BlockSec (@BlockSecTeam) July 30, 2023\n\nBesides, security firm BlockSec identified and tweeted about the vulnerability in the CRV/ETH pool approximately two hours before the attackers took advantage of it. As a result, some individuals, including Curve founder Michael Egorov, have accused BlockSec of assisting the attackers by publicly disclosing a live exploit. In response, BlockSec defended its actions, stating that its intention was solely to alert users about the new issue so they could safeguard their funds.\n\nDespite BlockSec\u2019s purported good intentions, whether this was the most appropriate course of action remains debatable.\n\nThe Real Threat \u2013 Egorov\u2019s Loan\n\nHowever, we cannot attribute Curve\u2019s rapid loss of confidence solely to the exploits. In perspective, the $70 million exploit affected less than 4% of Curve\u2019s TVL at the time of the incident.\n\n1/ Yesterday, several @CurveFinance pools were exploited. Curve founder, Michael Egorov, currently has a ~$100M loan backed by 427.5m $CRV (about 47% of the entire CRV circulating supply). With $CRV down 10% over the past 24 hours, the health of Curve is in jeopardy. \ud83e\uddf5\u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/EKpQCkDs6W \u2014 Delphi Digital (@Delphi_Digital) August 1, 2023\n\nThe actual threat arose when users realized the potential cascading effect on the price of CRV, putting Curve founder Michael Egorov\u2019s \u201csleeping dragon\u201d at risk \u2013 a $100 million loan secured by $427.5 million worth of CRV.\n\nEgorov\u2019s CRV collateral constitutes approximately 47% of the entire circulating supply of CRV. If the token\u2019s price were to drop, Egorov\u2019s loans across lending platforms like Aave, Fraxlend, Inverse Finance, and Abracadabra could face liquidation. This situation would introduce even more volatility into the broader DeFi ecosystem, as the bad debt would burden many of these lending platforms due to the illiquidity of CRV tokens.\n\nThe Irony of Egorov\u2019s Bailout\n\nTo avert the risk of liquidation and further volatility, Egorov swiftly took action. He executed a series of Over-The-Counter trades to repay a portion of his loans. Additionally, he created a new liquidity pool on Curve for FraxLend\u2019s CRV/FRAX market, incentivizing users to lend FRAX and reducing the CRV/FRAX utilization rate by rewarding CRV to those participating.\n\nThe Curve OTC War updates: 17.5M CRV to 0xf51\n\n5M CRV to Justin Sun\n\n4.25M CRV to DCFGod\n\n2.5M CRV to Ox4d3\n\n2.5M CRV to DWF Labs\n\n2.5M CRV to Cream: Multisig\n\n1.25M CRV to 0xcb5\n\n3.75M CRV to machibigbrother.eth\n\n250k CRV to 0x9bf \u2014 Sandra (@sandraaleow) August 1, 2023\n\nWhile Egorov\u2019s measures have temporarily prevented liquidation and alleviated further volatility, the situation where other major whales in the DeFi space bailed him out is reminiscent of scenarios often witnessed in traditional finance. Ironic, right?\n\nLet\u2019s look at on-chain data.\n\nMore Sideways Movement Ahead?\n\nSource: GlassNode\n\nIt has been more than 840 days since the bull market\u2019s peak in April 2021. Interestingly, the current recovery in 2023 is showing some promising signs compared to the last two cycles. The market is trading at -54% below its all-time high, an improvement from the historical -64% drawdown experienced in previous cycles.\n\nNotably, the 2015-2016 and 2019-2020 cycles saw six months of sideways movement and boredom before the market eventually accelerated above the -54% drawdown. This observation suggests that a similar period of monotony may be on the horizon.\n\nSource: GlassNode\n\nDespite a blazing start to 2023, quarterly and monthly price performances have cooled off. This pattern is reminiscent of prior cycles where the initial rally off the bottom was robust but followed by an extended period of choppy consolidation.\n\nBitcoin analysts often refer to this phase as the \u201cre-accumulation period.\u201d During this time, the market is characterized by uncertainty and erratic movements as investors re-evaluate their positions and wait for new catalysts to emerge.\n\nLong-Term Holders Still HODLing?\n\nAt the end of June 2023, the Bitcoin network experienced a notable spike in mature spending, a trend commonly observed during bull markets. Long-term coin holders who have held their coins for more than 155 days seize opportunities amid a strengthening market to take advantage of favorable conditions.\n\nHowever, the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (Binary CDD) is showing muted activity due to low spending. Such low spending is typically associated with bearish phases of Bitcoin and a weakening market.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the term, Binary CDD is a binary value. If the Supply-Adjusted Coin Days Destroyed (Supply-Adjusted CDD) is higher than the average Supply-Adjusted CDD, the Binary Coin Days points to \u20181\u2019. Otherwise, it points to \u20180\u2019. This indicator shows whether long-term holders move their coins more or less than average.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nA high density of \u20181\u2019 values indicates that long-term holders are moving their coins, potentially signaling their intent to sell. On the other hand, \u20180\u2019 values indicate a period when mature coins are less inclined to move, typically observed during a scaling bull market in Bitcoin. Long-term holders often take advantage of lower Bitcoin prices to accumulate more coins during such times.\n\nThe theory behind this indicator suggests that long-term coin holders may be apprehensive about the current state of the crypto industry in the absence of a scaling bull market. As a result, they may choose to wait out the uncertainty and keep most of their coins in cold wallets for the time being.\n\nPower of BTC Price Growth On The Decline\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nIn supply and demand dynamics and market making, exchanges are crucial as significant entities in the cryptocurrency market. Alongside on-chain data, examining the behavior of actors on exchanges is one of the best methods to assess market conditions.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nThree essential factors for Bitcoin\u2019s price growth and bullish speculation by exchange participants are worth considering:\n\nThe Outflow Mean from the spot market The Inflow Mean of stablecoins to exchanges The Trading Volume of Bitcoin on exchanges\n\nAll of these reflect the necessary liquidity in the market.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nIn July, all three of these factors experienced a simultaneous decrease, indicating a decline in liquidity, which is essential for facilitating another price jump. The reduction of necessary liquidity based on these criteria can lead to temporary or mid-term adjustments in the market. Therefore, monitoring the overall liquidity trend in the coming days is paramount for market participants.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Low Volatility and Its Implications\n\nSource: GlassNode\n\nIn 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s realized volatility across various observation windows, ranging from 1-month to 1-year, has significantly decreased, reaching multi-year lows. Particularly, the 1-year volatility window is now at levels not seen since December 2016. It marks the fourth instance of extreme volatility compression in Bitcoin\u2019s history, which has historically been infamously volatile.\n\nSource: GlassNode\n\nThe current price range between the 7-day high and low is merely 3.6%, and only 4.8% of all trading days have experienced a tighter weekly trade range. Similarly, the 30-day price range has been extremely constricted, with just a 9.8% band over the last month, and only 2.8% of all months have been tighter. These tight ranges indicate a prolonged period of consolidation, a rare occurrence in the notoriously volatile Bitcoin market.\n\nSource: GlassNode\n\nThis quiet spell extends to derivatives markets for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Futures and options trade volumes for these assets are at or approaching all-time lows.\n\nMarket\u2019s Risk-Off Stance and Shifting Dominance in Futures Markets\n\nSource: GlassNode\n\nAdditionally, the market is currently displaying a relatively risk-off stance, as evidenced by Bitcoin\u2019s increasing dominance within futures markets. Between 2021 and 2022, Ethereum futures markets saw a steady rise in trade volume and open interest, surpassing Bitcoin and peaking at a 60 BTC:40 ETH split in H2-2022.\n\nHowever, in the present year, the scales have tilted back in favor of Bitcoin, indicating a shift in sentiment towards the leading cryptocurrency. This trend suggests that lighter liquidity and a reduced risk appetite motivate investors to move capital towards assets perceived as lower-risk, ultimately pushing Bitcoin\u2019s dominance higher in futures markets.\n\nOptions Market and the Volatility Crush in Bitcoin\n\nSource: GlassNode\n\nLooking at the options markets, it becomes evident how severe the volatility crush has been, as implied volatility across all contract expirations has collapsed to all-time lows.\n\nBitcoin markets are notorious for their high volatility, with options trading at implied volatility levels ranging from 60% to over 100% for most of 2021-22. However, options are currently pricing in the smallest volatility premium in history, with implied volatility (IV) ranging between 24% and 52%, less than half of the long-term baseline.\n\nThis significant drop in implied volatility raises an intriguing question. Considering that fewer than 5% of all trading days have experienced a similar price range contraction, it suggests that Bitcoin may no longer be as infamously volatile as it once was\u2014or it could imply that volatility is currently being mispriced in the market.\n\nTraders Embrace Volatility, but Recent Drop in Trade Volume Indicates Low Volatility\n\nSource: Kaiko\n\nCurrently, both BTC and ETH are experiencing 180-day volatility at multi-year lows, with percentages of 46% and 49%, respectively.\n\nBTC began the year trading at $17k and had seen its gains slow down considerably compared to previous bull markets when it experienced rapid surges over short periods. Similarly, ETH, which has historically been much more volatile than BTC, is now exhibiting similar sluggishness in its price movement.\n\nThe market\u2019s present state is remarkably subdued, prompting questions about whether heightened volatility lies ahead. With both BTC and ETH experiencing multi-year low volatility, traders are closely monitoring the situation to determine the potential direction and magnitude of future price movements.\n\nTrade Volume Continues To Fall\n\nSource: Kaiko\n\nDespite Bitcoin experiencing a remarkable surge of 75% in 2023, the trade volume in the cryptocurrency market has continued to decline. Almost all exchanges witnessed double-digit decreases in trade volume in July compared to the previous year. A collapse in long-term volatility accompanies this trend, indicating that overall market participation remains low.\n\nAmong the exchanges, U.S. platforms saw the most substantial drop in volume, averaging around an 80% decrease. However, Coinbase, benefiting from a flight to quality after the SEC lawsuit against Binance.US, experienced a comparatively smaller decline in trade volume than the broader crypto market.\n\nSource: Kaiko\n\nNevertheless, last week, Coinbase\u2019s earnings call disclosed a strong decline in altcoin and institutional trading, suggesting that the adverse regulatory environment and bear market have impacted the exchange\u2019s performance. A steady increase in the share of BTC trading on the platform mirrors this shift in trading behavior. In Q2, BTC trading rose to 40%, up from 32% in Q1, reaching its highest level since Q4 2020.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "title": "The Rise Of Bitcoin: A Game-changer In Finance - Dataconomy",
        "content": "The pioneering cryptocurrency has captivated the financial world since its inception in 2009. Its revolutionary impact on finance cannot be understated, as it ushered in the era of decentralized digital currencies.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the journey of Bitcoin and how it has transformed the financial landscape, becoming a game-changer in the world of finance.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin was created by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a revolutionary technology called blockchain, a distributed ledger system that ensures transaction transparency, security, and immutability. Unlike traditional fiat currencies,\n\nBitcoin is not controlled by any central authority, making it truly decentralized. Its limited supply of 21 million coins contributes to its deflationary nature, contrasting the inflationary tendencies of fiat currencies. Transactions conducted with Bitcoin are pseudonymous, adding an extra layer of privacy.\n\nEarly adoption and growth\n\nIn its early days, Bitcoin faced skepticism from the financial industry and regulators alike. However, as its benefits became evident, it garnered attention from tech enthusiasts and libertarians who recognized its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems.\n\nEarly adopters utilized Bitcoin for various transactions, from online purchases to remittances and cross-border transfers. The rise of Bitcoin exchanges and secure wallets facilitated the buying and selling of cryptocurrency, enabling users to participate in this digital financial revolution.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s impact on finance\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of Bitcoin has been its contribution to financial inclusion. With traditional banking services often inaccessible to millions around the globe, Bitcoin offered a decentralized alternative for the unbanked population to access financial services, empowering them economically.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s borderless nature has facilitated faster and cheaper cross-border transactions, reducing the reliance on costly remittance services. The investment and speculative aspects of Bitcoin cannot be ignored either. As the cryptocurrency gained prominence, a thriving market emerged, offering investors an opportunity to diversify their portfolios.\n\nThe era of Bitcoin witnessed the emergence of mobile-friendly trading platforms like bitcoin bank, utilizing sophisticated technologies to easily and efficiently buy and sell cryptocurrencies.\n\nChallenges and controversies\n\nDespite its rapid growth, Bitcoin has faced its fair share of challenges and controversies. Governments and regulatory bodies have grappled with how to classify and regulate cryptocurrencies, leading to uncertainty and fluctuation in the market. The highly volatile nature of Bitcoin\u2019s price has also been a point of concern for investors and mainstream financial institutions.\n\nSecurity remains a critical issue, with hacking incidents and scams impacting user confidence. The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, which requires substantial energy consumption, has raised debates about its sustainability in the long run.\n\nBitcoin as a store of value and digital gold\n\nOver time, Bitcoin has evolved from being just a means of exchange to being viewed as a store of value, often called \u201cdigital gold.\u201d Its finite supply and scarcity have led some investors and institutions to consider it a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties. Consequently, Bitcoin has gained traction in mainstream finance, with companies and institutional investors integrating it into their investment strategies.\n\nThe role of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin has paved the way for the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. DeFi leverages blockchain technology to provide financial services without intermediaries, offering features like decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and smart contracts.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature has inspired the development of DeFi applications, further expanding the potential of blockchain technology in the financial domain.\n\nCentral Bank digital currencies (CBDCs) vs. Bitcoin\n\nAs Bitcoin continues gaining prominence, central banks worldwide have been exploring introducing their digital currencies, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). CBDCs aim to combine the benefits of digital currencies with the control of a central authority.\n\nWhile CBDCs may offer advantages in terms of faster and more efficient transactions, they differ significantly from the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.\n\nFuture prospects and challenges\n\nThe Bitcoin era is expected to witness further technological advancements as we look to the future. Solutions like the Lightning Network and layer 2 protocols aim to address Bitcoin\u2019s scalability issues, enabling faster and cheaper transactions. Regulatory clarity, mainstream adoption, and environmental sustainability remain significant hurdles for cryptocurrency to overcome.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe rise of Bitcoin has truly been a game-changer in finance. From its humble beginnings, Bitcoin has disrupted traditional financial systems, offering a decentralized alternative for the unbanked and empowering users with financial sovereignty.\n\nDespite facing challenges and controversies, its potential as a store of value and investment asset cannot be ignored. As the Bitcoin era continues, it will be exciting to witness its ongoing evolution and potential to shape the future of finance and beyond.\n\nFeatured image credit: Pierre Borthiry \u2013 Peiobty/Unsplash"

        "title": "Bitcoin Fate Hangs In The Balance, 50% Chance Of Falling Below $25,000 In September - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been no stranger to dramatic price swings in the volatile cryptocurrency world. As September approaches, market analysts closely monitor BTC\u2019s possibility of plunging below the $25,000 mark.\n\nHowever, history has shown that September\u2019s struggles often pave the way for a resurgence in October, with massive rallies that rekindle investor optimism.\n\nPotential For BTC To Drop Below $25,000 Before A Promising October\n\nWhen examining Bitcoin\u2019s historical performance during September, it becomes evident that the month has posed challenges for the world\u2019s most renowned cryptocurrency.\n\nPrevious September has witnessed BTC experiencing declines of up to 13%. This downward trend has undoubtedly concerned traders and investors, raising questions about the sustainability of Bitcoin\u2019s bullish momentum.\n\nAccording to Timothy Peterson, market analyst and investment Manager, based on current market analysis, there is a 50% probability that Bitcoin\u2019s price will dip below the $25,000 threshold before September concludes.\n\nWhile a potential drop below $25,000 might cause temporary unease among Bitcoin enthusiasts, historical patterns suggest that October could be the month to look forward to.\n\nIn the past, September\u2019s price declines have often catalyzed significant rallies in the subsequent month. Observing the heatmap above, Peterson identified instances where Bitcoin rebounded with gains as high as 48% following sharp declines in September.\n\nIf Bitcoin does indeed experience a dip below $25,000 in September, it may mark the final significant correction before the commencement of a new bull run cycle.\n\nOn this note, Peterson believes that such a dip, coupled with the subsequent recovery and October\u2019s potential rally, could set the stage for substantial gains in the coming months.\n\nBitcoin Bullish Divergence\n\nAs BTC experienced a drop from $32,000 to $29,000, trader Ali Martinez highlighted a significant trend; the number of new Bitcoin addresses continued to rise steadily.\n\nThis intriguing divergence between price and network growth provides insights into BTC\u2019s potentially stable long-term uptrend.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s price exhibited a downward trajectory, the number of newly created Bitcoin addresses has consistently grown.\n\nThis divergence is noteworthy, suggesting that despite short-term price fluctuations, the network\u2019s expansion remains robust. It signifies a growing interest in Bitcoin adoption and usage, which, in turn, supports the notion of a stable and sustainable long-term uptrend.\n\nConversely, Bitcoin remains trapped within a price range of $29,200 and $28,900, a pattern that has persisted since the start of August. As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $28,960, reflecting a 0.5% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin investment was more profitable than crypto hedge fund in H1 2023 - Technext",
        "content": "A new report has shown that investors would have benefited more from buying and holding Bitcoin than investing in crypto hedge funds during the first half of 2023.\n\nAccording to a research report from Swiss-based crypto investment adviser 21e6 Capital, the classic buy-and-hold approach to Bitcoin outperformed most crypto funds by 68.8% in the first six months of the year.\n\nThis is largely due to the fact that bitcoin was one of the best-performing crypto assets in the first half of 2023, seeing massive gains from prospects of the SEC approving a Spot Bitcoin ETF. The price of Bitcoin started the year around $15,500 and climbed to over $31,400 in July.\n\nCrypto hedge funds gather money from investors to invest in crypto projects, including blockchain ventures, derivative projects, and multiple other digital asset industry projects. In other words, they are investment vehicles that gather capital from multiple investors intending to secure higher investment returns.\n\nRead also:\n\nUSDT issuer, Tether reports a total excess reserve of $3.3 billion in Q2 2023\n\nInvestors typically join a hedge fund because it is easier to bear the high management costs and brave the risks of investing in a hedge fund. The scheme has proven to be a profitable venture for players in the space in the past, and it is interesting to discover how the tides turned in favour of the typical Bitcoin investment in the first half of the year.\n\nThe 21e6 report\n\nThe Switzerland-based investment adviser 21e6 Capital AG report says on average, crypto funds generated returns of 15.2% in the first half of 2023, but bitcoin saw gains of around 84%.\n\n\u201cAll crypto fund strategies achieved positive results this year. But relative to Bitcoin, they underperformed, especially those with significant exposure to altcoins, to futures, or those strongly dependent on momentum signals.\u201d \u2013 the 21e6 report.\n\nIn the report, 21e6 Capital AG\u2019s head of marketing, Maximilian Bruckner, outlined that crypto hedge funds have been \u201cfrequently able to significantly outperform Bitcoin in previous bull runs.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe attributed much of the underwhelming performance of crypto hedge funds in 2023 to the challenging market conditions and their significant cash in late 2022.\n\nFollowing the implosion of FTX and other crypto projects in 2022, the report suggested that many crypto funds opted to take fewer risks, therefore missing out on a significant BTC price rally in H1 of 2023.\n\nThe report adds:\n\n\u201cFunds with large cash positions will underperform Bitcoin in a bull market unless the funds\u2019 assets perform significantly better than Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cDue to the general sentiment left behind by the end of 2022, many funds had larger-than-normal cash positions. Furthermore, most major altcoins also underperformed Bitcoin \u2013 a tough environment for funds.\u201d\n\nHow FTX closure made crypto hedge funds underperform\n\nDue to the sudden closure of the multibillion-dollar crypto exchange FTX in November, crypto hedge funds struggled. Persistent challenges stemming from the FTX bankruptcy affected the performance of crypto hedge funds. The fallout from the crisis has even forced the closure of some crypto funds.\n\nRead also:\n\nWith a 83% gain, data shows Bitcoin was more profitable than every other asset in H1 2023\n\n21e6 Capital tracks more than 700 crypto funds globally, as well as the regulatory performance reports of 123 funds across 70 firms, and the firm reports that the underperformance has led to the closure of about 97, or 13%, of those crypto hedge funds. For instance, crypto investment firm Galois Capital with $40 million worth of assets trapped in the FTX exchange, announced its closure in February.\n\nAlso, the closure of three crypto-friendly banks earlier this year and the continued turbulence around potential regulations contributed to the decline. Following the FTX crisis, many banks adjusted their approach to the crypto sector as a whole. Under increased regulatory scrutiny, previously crypto-friendly banks cut off ties with crypto hedge funds.\n\nIn conclusion, FTX was a prominent crypto derivatives exchange for hedge funds. But now that there is still no clear alternative to take its top position, crypto hedge funds are expected to struggle, at least in the near term."

Sources: MacroMicro and Cambridge University\n\nThe highest average cost registered in the 1-year period was $49,415 on July 17, versus a price of $30,145/BTC on the same day, for a loss of around $19,270 per mined BTC.\n\nExcept for a few single-day deviations on the chart, Bitcoin miners were mostly mining underwater, according to the presented data. This makes mining businesses hedge their position with financial products such as energy futures contracts.\n\nThe entities that suffer the most are small and medium Bitcoin miners who can\u2019t keep a profitable activity, losing market share and hashrate share for bigger miners \u2014 in a sort of economy of scale dynamic.\n\nThe most recent difficulty adjustment comes amid an energy crisis in Texas, one of the most prominent hubs for Bitcoin mining in the world, as reported by CBS News. Making energy even costier than before.\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty adjusted to 52.39 trillion\n\nThe block height 802368 was confirmed on August 9 with a positive adjustment of 0.10% on mining difficulty. It now requires 52.39 trillion hashes to a block to be considered valid.\n\nOn June 11 (block 798336), the difficulty was adjusted to an all-time high of 53.91 trillion (+6.45%), followed by a retrace on July 26 (block 800352) to 52.33 trillion hashes (-2.94%), which still holds this metric above historical data.\n\nDifficulty adjustments are directly correlated with hashrate dynamics. The more proof-of-work (PoW) that is being computed by Bitcoin miners \u2014 measured by hashrate \u2014 the higher the chances that one of these miners will find a valid block in an interval lower than 10 minutes. Also valid for the opposite direction, when less hashrate on the network also means longer times between blocks.\n\nWhat is the mining difficulty and how does it work\n\nMining through the proof-of-work system was the method chosen to secure the Bitcoin network and distribute new BTC to entities providing work and resources to the activity.\n\nTo guarantee a programmed distribution up to the maximum limit of 21 million, guaranteeing a controlled inflation of the BTC circulating supply, the Bitcoin protocol uses algorithms that help to keep the creation of a new block (with the corresponding payment of its reward) every about 10 minutes.\n\nThis algorithm works by adjusting mining difficulty. Evaluating the frequency of discovering new blocks over the last 2,015 blocks \u2014 about two weeks, assuming 10 minutes per block.\n\nIf the last 2,015 blocks are being mined in an interval greater than the desired 10 minutes, the mining difficulty needs to decrease, making it easier to mine more blocks in a shorter amount of time. The reverse is also correct: increasing the mining difficulty if the last 2,015 blocks have been discovered in an interval of less than 10 minutes between each block.\n\nAlthough the adjustment is proportional to the computational power being used in the network, it cannot exceed four times the previous value. In case, the mining difficulty adjustment always needs to be less than 300%, in a raise; or less than 75%, in a reduction.\n\nThe mining difficulty is affected by including or removing the number of \u201czeros\u201d that must go to the left of the other random characters."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) briefly broke above the $30,000 threshold within the last 24 hours, defying declining stock prices and a strengthening US dollar. Still, its stay above this pivotal mark was short-lived, as the cryptocurrency quickly retreated to approximately $29,800.\n\nHowever, although the leading crypto is already trading in the green, a far greater move may be in the cards, according to a widely-used technical indicator.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin Bollinger Bands (BB) \u201care the narrowest they\u2019ve been on the weekly since October 2020,\u201d real-time chart provider Barchart noted on August 8.\n\nBitcoin Bollinger Bands trading in the narrowest range since October 2020. Source: Barcharts\n\nWhat does it indicate?\n\nBollinger Bands serve the purpose of gauging market volatility and detecting potential shifts in price direction. When these bands contract, they imply reduced market volatility, resulting in narrower price fluctuations.\n\nFurthermore, constricted Bollinger Bands can suggest a phase of consolidation or an absence of a distinct trend. Traders often view this as a prelude to an impending price breakout. As volatility rises, the bands expand, marking the emergence of a new trend or a substantial price movement.\n\nConversely, traders may also interpret tight Bollinger Bands as an indication of uncertainty or a period warranting careful consideration.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAt press time on August 9, BTC was trading at $29,774, up 2.17% on the last day.\n\nBTC 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe maiden cryptocurrency gained 1.15% over the past week while losing around 1.7% on a monthly basis.\n\nAs can be observed from the chart, the price of Bitcoin rose above $30,100 at one point in the past 24 hours, before retreating below this psychological threshold.\n\nThe upswing came despite a drop in equity prices and a surge in the US dollar. According to blockchain intelligence platform Santiment, Bitcoin transactions are witnessing the highest profit taking in about 3 weeks. Specifically, the ratio of profit-taking versus loss-taking currently stands at 2:1, data showed.\n\nMeanwhile, long-term average trading returns are back above 20%, after sliding below 18% earlier this month.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
