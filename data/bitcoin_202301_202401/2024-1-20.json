        "content": "Nearly a dozen new investments funds that hold Bitcoin began trading last week, making it easier for anyone with a basic brokerage account to buy a slice of the digital currency.\n\nSeveral established financial institutions, including Fidelity and BlackRock, have coalesced around Bitcoin because it is the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency.\n\nBut Bitcoin remains an enigma to most everyday investors, and it\u2019s hard to separate the buzz from any true potential. It\u2019s also wildly volatile.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s a bet. And institutions are wagering that plenty of investors want in.\n\nBut putting crypto into a traditional investment wrapper does not paper over the underlying risks. Here\u2019s a look at how it works:\n\nWhat is an exchange-traded fund?\n\nExchange-traded funds are similar to mutual funds, but they can be traded on an exchange like a stock. E.T.F.s track the performance of the assets they hold, which might include a diversified basket of securities like stock or bonds, or even single commodities, like gold, silver and crypto."

        "title": "Vanguard unfazed by boycott calls after it refuses to offer Bitcoin ETFs: \u2018They won\u2019t lose a single 401k plan over it\u2019 - Fortune",
        "content": "In 2017, legendary investor Jack Bogle famously warned people to \u201cavoid Bitcoin like the plague.\u201d More than six years later, Vanguard Group Inc. is still stoking the crypto world\u2019s ire by sticking to the conservative investing approach of its late founder.\n\nAmid the euphoria unleashed by the long-awaited debut of the first fully fledged Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US, Vanguard sparked uproar last week with its pointed decision to refuse to offer the new ETFs on its gigantic trading platform.\n\n#BoycottVanguard started trending on X, accumulating thousands of posts, with users pledging to pull their money from the asset management giant.\n\nVanguard\u2019s response? To double down. The firm, which controls $8.6 trillion, has not only snubbed Bitcoin-spot products, it\u2019s yanked futures-backed Bitcoin funds from its platform, too. That means it now offers no crypto products whatsoever, unlike its peers.\n\nThe saga speaks to Vanguard\u2019s deeply entrenched investing philosophy, one that hearkens back to Bogle himself. The Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based firm was founded by the money management icon in 1975 on a bedrock of investing in stocks and bonds \u2014 assets that generate cash flow, dividends and interest payments \u2014 while eschewing commodities.\n\nVanguard has traditionally steered clear of the latter \u2014 seen lacking intrinsic value and an internal rate of return \u2014 with Bogle dismissing commodity investing as \u201ctotal speculation.\u201d Modern-day Vanguard still follows that gospel closely nearly a half-century later, with just one commodity fund out of more than 400 offered worldwide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising whatsoever that Vanguard has taken this stance given that there\u2019s ample precedent for it and more fundamentally, it\u2019s in alignment with their long-held investment principles,\u201d said Ben Johnson, head of client solutions at Morningstar Inc.\n\nThat discipline extends beyond Vanguard\u2019s own lineup of mutual funds and ETFs and into its brokerage arm as well. While commodity ETFs are available to trade, the company pulled \u201cvery speculative and highly complex\u201d leveraged and inverse products from its platform in 2019.\n\nEven as billions roll into the newly-launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, Vanguard has no plans to offer any crypto-related products, a spokesperson said.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Need Gatekeepers\u2019\n\nVanguard\u2019s rejection of crypto stands in stark contrast to its industry peers. BlackRock Inc., Fidelity and Invesco Ltd. all launched spot Bitcoin ETFs last week, while centuries-old State Street is providing fund servicing to several of the products.\n\nMeanwhile, Franklin Templeton has gone all-in on marketing its Bitcoin fund, putting laser-eyes on its X avatar of Benjamin Franklin and advocating for investors to add Bitcoin to 60/40 portfolios.\n\nTraditional finance\u2019s embrace of Bitcoin ETFs has only fueled online vitriol against Vanguard.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need gatekeepers to tell us how to invest,\u201d reads one X post with more than 2,600 likes. \u201cI\u2019ll go where me and my money are treated best,\u201d reads another with a screenshot of a Vanguard plan distribution request.\n\nStill, it\u2019s highly unlikely the #BoycottVanguard movement will even make a dent in the company\u2019s business, according to industry expert Dave Nadig.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t lose a single 401k plan over it, and an infinitesimally small number of brokerage clients,\u201d Nadig said.\n\nMeanwhile, cash continues to pour into Vanguard\u2019s lineup. Roughly $4.4 billion has been added to Vanguard\u2019s stable of 84 ETFs in the past week alone, after luring $157 billion in 2023, Bloomberg data show, more than any other asset manager. Vanguard has grown its share of the $8 trillion ETF market for 21 consecutive years, putting it on the cusp of dethroning industry leader BlackRock.\n\nDespite drawing the crypto community\u2019s disdain, Vanguard \u2014 with its rock-bottom fees and unique corporate structure in which fund investors elect its board members and effectively own the company \u2014 has still attracted something of a cult following online. On forum Bogleheads.org, any posts related to \u201cinvestment strategies based on securities or physical assets that have no underlying value or negative expected long term returns\u201d (hint: crypto) are banned.\n\nWhile shunning crypto ETFs could be a long-term risk should it ultimately put off younger investors, it\u2019s a small one relative to Vanguard\u2019s loyal base, according to Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Eric Balchunas.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, Vanguard can\u2019t keep money from coming in,\u201d said Balchunas, Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s senior ETF analyst and the author of The Bogle Effect. \u201cEven if Vanguard said, \u2018Please stop investing with us,\u2019 it wouldn\u2019t do anything. They have banked so much trust and goodwill with their customers.\u201d"

        "title": "1 Surprising Crypto Stock to Buy Before It Soars 100% - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Right now, crypto investors are laser focused on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). That's fair enough. The recent approval of the new spot Bitcoin ETFs has made Bitcoin even more popular than it already was.\n\nBut if you expand your focus, there are several stocks that stand to benefit from any future gains in Bitcoin. The one that's on my radar right now is MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR). That might sound strange, given that MicroStrategy is an enterprise software company. But if you look under the hood, you'll see why this stock could skyrocket 100% or more this year.\n\nMicroStrategy as a Bitcoin proxy stock\n\nThe first thing you need to know about MicroStrategy is that it holds a lot of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. And I mean a lot. After a recent buying spree at the end of 2023, MicroStrategy now holds 189,150 Bitcoins. That ranks first among all publicly traded companies, and it's not even close. At Bitcoin's current price of $42,500, those holdings are valued at approximately $8 billion.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIf you compare the company's overall market cap ($6.5 billion) to the value of its Bitcoin, then it becomes immediately obvious just how leveraged MicroStrategy is to the price of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin holdings are worth more than the company itself! In fact, some investors refer to MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin proxy stock because, for the past year, the stock has essentially been just a way to get access to Bitcoin without actually buying Bitcoin. As a result, over the past 12 months, MicroStrategy is up more than 100%.\n\nBitcoin proxy stock or Bitcoin ETF?\n\nBut there's just one problem. The approval of the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024 has completely shifted the narrative. The very same investors who once used MicroStrategy as a proxy stock can now invest in Bitcoin ETFs instead. Theoretically, these Bitcoin ETFs will do a much better job of tracking the price of Bitcoin. And, thus, they could eventually make MicroStrategy less appealing to investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs evidence of this, the price of MicroStrategy fell by 20% in just the first 48 hours after Bitcoin ETF approval. For the year, MicroStrategy is down 30%. On top of all that, former MicroStrategy CEO (and current executive chairman) Michael Saylor says that he is planning to sell off 315,000 shares in the company worth over $200 million between now and April. So that should put downward pressure on the price of MicroStrategy as well.\n\nWill Bitcoin go to $100,000?\n\nBut there might be two very good reasons to buy the dip on MicroStrategy. For one, investors appear to be ignoring completely the fact that MicroStrategy is actually an enterprise software company. As noted above, they are ascribing zero value to the company's core business operations (which includes artificial intelligence- and business intelligence-related software solutions), and instead simply valuing MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin proxy. So that's one additional source of value for MicroStrategy.\n\nMoreover, there's the future price of Bitcoin to consider. The Bitcoin ETF is just the first catalyst for Bitcoin this year. The second major catalyst -- the upcoming halving event -- is arriving in April. In three previous halving cycles, the price of Bitcoin has exploded, so investors are expecting the same to happen this year as well. That partially explains why Saylor plans to sell off all those company shares by April: He needs the money to invest in more Bitcoin before it goes completely parabolic.\n\nAdmittedly, this is a very risky strategy, but it's so bold it just might work. According to a growing number of influential voices on Wall Street, the price of Bitcoin could top $100,000 by the end of the year. Thus, by extension, the value of all that Bitcoin on the balance sheet of MicroStrategy should also double. And that means the market cap of MicroStrategy should also double.\n\nBefore you buy MicroStrategy\n\nJust keep in mind that investors have a number of different ways to get access to Bitcoin. They can buy it directly, via a cryptocurrency exchange such as Coinbase Global. They can buy it indirectly via a futures-based Bitcoin ETF. They can buy it indirectly via a spot Bitcoin ETF. And, finally, they can buy it indirectly via an investment in a Bitcoin proxy stock such as MicroStrategy.\n\nYour risk-reward profile will likely determine which strategy makes the most sense for your portfolio. For example, investment giant Vanguard Group has said that it would not be offering the new Bitcoin ETFs to its customers. Instead, (drum roll, please) it will be loading up on MicroStrategy.\n\nFor me, that's a pretty convincing argument that Bitcoin proxy stocks such as MicroStrategy will continue to perform well in 2024. You get indirect access to Bitcoin, plus the additional value from the underlying operations of the company. There is likely to be quite a bit of volatility along the way, so just be sure to buckle up if you plan on adding to your MicroStrategy position this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MicroStrategy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MicroStrategy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and MicroStrategy wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Why Cathie Wood Believes Bitcoin's Upcoming \"Halving\" Will Redefine the Crypto Market in 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The upcoming halving of mining rewards in the Bitcoin (BTC -4.58%) network is not like the others. Ark Invest mastermind Cathie Wood found a game-changing quality in this fundamental update that sets it apart from the first three.\n\nWill this unique event make Bitcoin a better long-term storage system for wealth than investing in gold? Let's have a look.\n\nWhat Cathie Wood said\n\nIn a recent video interview with Yassine Elmandjra, Ark Invest's director of digital assets, Wood unveiled a rarely discussed detail of Bitcoin's next halving event that could change the game for the cryptocurrency market:\n\nThe rate of growth in supply is going to be cut in half to just under 1% per year. If you compare this to gold, the gold supply has increased on average roughly 1% per year. Bitcoin's supply growth is going to drop below that. (Lightly edited for readability)\n\nWhy is this insight so important?\n\nIt goes back to the famous notion of prices in a free market reflecting the balance between supply and demand. Gold is traditionally seen as a great value-storage tool due to its limited supply and fairly slow rate of new production. But now, for the first time, Bitcoin's supply side rate of growth will suddenly drop below the inflation pace of gold.\n\n\"The steady addition of a constant amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation,\" according to the Bitcoin whitepaper that defines how this cryptocurrency works. \"In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\"\n\nSo the self-styled \"open-source peer-to-peer money,\" or digital gold, finally plays the part for which it was designed. That sure sounds like a game-changing event.\n\nBitcoin's gold-like stability\n\nBitcoin's limited supply is hardly a secret. In fact, its lifetime limit of 21 million digital coins is often held up as a reason to invest in this digital paragon of long-term stability.\n\n19.6 million of those tokens have already been mined, leaving less than 7% of the total supply for future mining efforts. With a halving of the mining rewards scheduled at roughly four-year intervals, the rate of Bitcoin growth will only slow down more in 2029, 2033, and beyond. The last Bitcoin should be mined somewhere around the year 2140. After that, mining rewards will consist of transaction fees alone.\n\nThis extremely long-term plan is hard-coded into Bitcoin's software. Changing these growth-limiting parameters would require an overwhelming agreement among the supply side stakeholders to sacrifice the fiscal stability of their own assets -- an improbable event, especially if Bitcoin actually evolves into a ubiquitous digital alternative to gold.\n\nThe impact of the next Bitcoin halving\n\nSo far, Bitcoin's halvings have always heralded a sharp increase in the cryptocurrency's price.\n\nFor instance, one Bitcoin was worth $12 on the first reward cut in 2012. One year later, the price peaked at $1,170 before backing down again. The 2016 halving sent Bitcoin prices from $640 to $19,650 in 17 months. The latest reduction in mining rewards took place in May 2020 at a price of $8,600. 18 months later, that price cycle topped out at $67,500.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results, but Bitcoin breaks that rule of thumb in some ways.\n\nThe halvings are quite predictable. They will happen roughly every four years, radically changing the economics of Bitcoin mining each time.\n\nThe mining process serves a crucial purpose in the processing of Bitcoin transactions. Without it, the blockchain grinds to a halt. Therefore, the whole system makes sense only as long as miners receive enough rewards to run a successful business. And when the mining rewards are cut in half, a steady consumption of processing cycles and electric power will produce half as many Bitcoin tokens. Bitcoin miners would go out of business if prices don't rise over time.\n\nTherefore, halvings almost inevitably lead to higher Bitcoin prices. It's not the only factor in play when market makers determine Bitcoin's real-time price, but arguably the most important and predictable pattern-making tool on the encrypted table. The inevitability of this trend will only break if Bitcoin itself goes out of fashion and shuts down. So, the pattern of dramatic price increases in the months after each halving will continue as long as Bitcoin has a future.\n\nAnd the next halving may indeed be different, as the inflation rate below gold's annual production increase suggests a game-changing level of value-guarding stability.\n\nThe crypto market as a whole, and Bitcoin in particular, still faces numerous headwinds and challenges. The progress of digital currencies can stumble on legal and regulatory roadblocks, on slow uptake of crypto-based services in the consumer market, and on unexpected technology jumps, just to name a few potential game-breakers. But the steady rhythm of scheduled mining-reward halvings will continue regardless, resulting in rock-solid stability or the end of the Bitcoin world.\n\nBitcoin deserves a modest investment today\n\nI expect the Bitcoin community to address and overcome these inevitable challenges as they come along. The supply side looks solid, as long as the global market can generate a steady or rising amount of demand for this digital asset.\n\nIn the long run, I see tremendous value in the large-scale adoption of digital currencies and blockchain networks, and Bitcoin is the 800-pound gorilla to beat in this sector. So I suggest adding some Bitcoin exposure to your investment portfolio, but I'm not going all-in on cryptocurrency quite yet -- just in case the ambitious gold-replacement plan doesn't work out."

        "content": "JPMorgan, Jane Street and other authorised participants may be using Bitcoin futures ETFs to hedge their spot ETF activities.\n\nDespite JPMorgan\u2019s CEO railing against crypto last week, his firm is a key player in the new spot Bitcoin ETF market.\n\nSpot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds continued to smash expectations last week, and some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest names are playing a crucial role despite bosses like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon continuing to criticise Bitcoin.\n\nSo-called authorised participants include JPMorgan and speed-trading giants Jane Street and Virtu Financial. All of three of these firms are included as APs for BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to SEC filings.\n\nAPs ensure spot Bitcoin ETFs launched by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity trade as close as possible to the underlying value of the Bitcoin they hold, helping investors get the best deal possible.\n\nDespite JPMorgan\u2019s role in the Bitcoin ETF ecosystem, Dimon called Bitcoin a \u201cPet Rock\u201d at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Davos \u2014 his latest in a long line of crypto-critical comments.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nEven as Dimon stayed true to his Bitcoin-bashing form, however, traditional financial firms are playing a crucial role with the new ETFs \u2014 and they\u2019re doing a good job.\n\n\u2018Crushed it\u2019\n\nThe Wall Street bigwigs \u201ccrushed it\u201d on the first day of trading, Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said.\n\nThere had been worries that the ETFs shares might trade at a higher price than the Bitcoin they represent, Balchunas said, but authorised participants ensured that risk was mitigated.\n\nBased on whether the ETF is trading above or below its net asset value \u2014 the cost of the underlying Bitcoin it holds \u2014 these firms will create or redeem shares.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIf it trades higher, they\u2019ll need to create more shares, adding supply to the market and lowering the price. If it trades lower, then managers will redeem shares for cash, reducing supply.\n\nAuthorised participants don\u2019t handle Bitcoin directly, as creations and redemptions are done with cash rather than so-called \u201cin-kind\u201d redemptions issuers had fought for.\n\nA week on from launch, these newborn ETFs continue to trade in a tight range to their net asset value.\n\nWhy does this matter? Tighter spreads mean better deals for investors, and a better chance at increasing flows into the ETFs, Balchunas said on Wednesday.\n\nSophisticated strategies\n\nThe use of cash creations and redemptions, instead of in-kind creations, means there\u2019s a \u201csettlement period gap,\u201d Coinbase\u2019s head of institutional research, David Duong, told DL News via email.\n\nThis gap is the time between authorised participants receiving buy orders and when new shares are created. As a result, authorised participants will need to protect themselves from price movements during these periods, likely using pre-existing regulated products.\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs experienced a brief renaissance following the launch of spot funds. ProShares\u2019 Bitcoin futures ETF, BITO, processed $2 billion in trading volume on the day the spot ETFs launched \u2014 beating its previous record by more than 50%, according to Coinbase.\n\nVolumes dropped about 75% a week later, trading $503 million in volume on January 18.\n\nInstitutional investors might be using these types of funds to protect themselves during the settlement period gap.\n\nLiquid pre-existing products such as Bitcoin futures ETFs act as a \u201cparking spot,\u201d of sorts, Balchunas said in December. Since BITO is highly liquid \u2014 meaning holders can sell shares into cash with ease \u2014 firms managing the spot Bitcoin ETFs can hold it as a sort of transition tool to reduce volatility risks as they create and redeem shares in the newly launched spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cDespite this drop, we view BITO as a continued integral part of the Bitcoin ETF space,\u201d Coinbase\u2019s report said, referring to the 75% plunge in trading this week.\n\nAuthorised participants \u201cwill continue to rely on regulated means of hedging themselves, such as long CME futures or long BITO when creating shares,\u201d Coinbase said.\n\nThese products give the firms protection against movements in Bitcoin\u2019s price as they arbitrage the shares back in line with the net asset value.\n\nSome of these firms may have gone a step further in their hedging strategies, according to Coinbase.\n\nBuying early\n\nCoinbase analysts, led by Duong, suspect some of these authorised participants bought Bitcoin ahead of the launch.\n\nThe crypto exchange\u2019s report said some authorised participants \u201cpotentially bought Bitcoin in anticipation of the ETF launch,\u201d while at the same time selling Bitcoin futures ETFs \u201cto hedge potential client buys and sells intraday.\u201d\n\nCoinbase\u2019s theory is \u201cconsistent with evidence in the report,\u201d Duong said, namely the compressing basis between CME Bitcoin futures and spot. Basis refers to the difference between the cash price of Bitcoin versus its futures price on the CME.\n\n\u201cFollowing the launch of the spot ETF, the basis between CME futures and spot has compressed to less than 0.5%, dropping its premium tenfold from its recent peak at the start of 2024. That may explain some of the activity described above,\u201d Coinbase\u2019s report said.\n\nAdam Morgan is a markets correspondent at DL News. Reach him at adam@dlnews.com.

        "title": "Assessing the Health of Bitcoin - Lyn Alden",
        "content": "Published January 2024\n\nWhen investing in bitcoin as an asset, or companies that build on top of the Bitcoin network as part of an asset mix, we need some set of metrics with which to evaluate the progress of the investment thesis, and by extension, the health of the Bitcoin network.\n\nIt\u2019s more than just a price on a chart; it\u2019s an open-source network with millions of users, thousands of developers, hundreds of companies, and several ecosystems built on top of it. Most Wall Street analysts and retail investors haven\u2019t actually used a bitcoin wallet, taken self-custody of the asset, sent it to others, and/or used it in various ecosystems, and yet doing so is very helpful for fundamental research.\n\nBitcoin means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. It enables portable savings, censorship-resistant global payments, and immutable data storage. If you\u2019re an American or European investor in high quality stocks and bonds, and are not thinking about the Bitcoin network from the perspective of a Nigerian, Vietnamese, Argentinian, Lebanese, Russian, or Turkish middle-class saver for example, then you\u2019ve not yet fundamentally analyzed the asset\u2019s use case.\n\nAnd on top of that, people assess the health of the network in multiple different ways. If Bitcoin doesn\u2019t conform to what they want it to be, they might conclude that it\u2019s not doing well. On the other hand, if Bitcoin fits exactly with what they want, then they might think it\u2019s doing great even if there is plenty of frictions remaining to be solved.\n\nHaving spent a lot of time studying monetary history, as well as spending time in the startup/venture space around Bitcoin and studying the technical details of the protocol in recent years, I have a handful of key metrics that I personally look at when assessing the health of the Bitcoin network. This article walks through them and sees how the network is doing in terms of each one.\n\n1) Market Capitalization and Liquidity\n\nSome people say price doesn\u2019t matter. \u201c1 BTC = 1 BTC\u201d is how they like to put it. It\u2019s not bitcoin that is volatile; it\u2019s that the world is volatile around bitcoin, man.\n\nAnd there\u2019s indeed some truth to that. Bitcoin has a fully diluted supply of 21 million bitcoin (technically 2.1 quadrillion sats, which are the smallest denomination of on-chain bitcoin), created and distributed in a pre-programmed decreasing pattern, produces blocks on average every ten minutes thanks to an automatic difficulty adjustment, and has operated with remarkable consistency since its inception with a higher uptime rate than Fedwire. I don\u2019t know what the dollar supply will be next year, but I know what the bitcoin supply will be and can directly audit its exact supply at any time.\n\nBut price is an important signal. It doesn\u2019t mean much on a day-to-day, week-to-week, or even year-to-year basis, but it certainly means something across several years. The Bitcoin network itself might be serving as a heartbeat of clockwork order in a world of chaos, but price is nonetheless a measure of its adoption. Bitcoin is competing in the global marketplace of monies now, against more than 160 different fiat currencies, gold, silver, and various other cryptocurrencies. As a store of value it\u2019s also competing with non-monetary assets like equities and real estate or other things we can own with our limited resources.\n\nIt\u2019s not really that the dollar is fluctuating in price around bitcoin as some proponents like to say. Bitcoin is the younger, more volatile, less liquid, smaller network compared to the dollar; it\u2019s indeed the one fluctuating more in price. In some years, bitcoin holders can buy a lot more property, food, gold, copper, oil, S&P 500 shares, dollars, rupees, or whatever else compared to what they could buy in the prior year. In other years, they can buy a lot less. Bitcoin\u2019s price is mainly what\u2019s fluctuating on any given intermediate-term basis, and the fact that it fluctuates affects the purchasing power of the holders. So far, the fluctuations have aimed sharply up, meaning that a holder of bitcoin can buy a lot more than they could several years ago.\n\nIf price stagnates for a long time, that\u2019s a piece of information. If that were to happen, we should reasonably ask why Bitcoin is failing to appeal to people. Is it not providing solutions to their problems? If not, why?\n\nFortunately, as the chart above shows, that has not been the case. Bitcoin\u2019s price keeps making higher highs and higher lows, cycle after cycle. It\u2019s one of the best-performing assets in history. And I would say it has held up rather well given the aggressive tightening of central bank balance sheets and the sharp rise in positive real rates over the past couple of years. Looking at on-chain indicators, its historic correlation with global broad money supply, and other factors, Bitcoin continues to enjoy long-term adoption and growth. But it must be monitored.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s liquidity. How much daily trading volume is happening on exchanges? How much transaction value is being sent around on-chain? Money is the most salable good. Liquidity is very important.\n\nBitcoin has been ranking very well in this metric too, with billions or tens of billions of dollars worth of daily trading volume against other currencies and assets, which puts it on par with Apple (AAPL) stock in terms of daily exchange liquidity. And unlike Apple where the vast majority of volume is on the Nasdaq exchange, bitcoins trade in many exchanges and currencies around the world including some peer-to-peer marketplaces. There are also billions of dollars worth of on-chain transfer volume in a given day.\n\nA way to think about liquidity (and it\u2019ll likely make you more bullish when you realize it), is that liquidity begets more liquidity. For money, that\u2019s a big piece of what the network effect is.\n\nWhen bitcoin had thousands of dollars worth of trading volume per day, someone couldn\u2019t put a million dollars into it, even spread out over weeks, without drastically moving the price. It wasn\u2019t a big and liquid enough market for them yet.\n\nAnd then when bitcoin had millions of dollars worth of trading volume per day, someone couldn\u2019t put a billion dollars into it, even spread out over weeks.\n\nAnd now that bitcoin has billions of dollars of trading volume, there are trillion-dollar pools of capital that can\u2019t put meaningful percentages into it; it\u2019s still too small and illiquid for them. If they start putting a few hundred million dollars or a couple billions of dollars per day into it, that\u2019s enough to tilt the supply/demand toward the buy side and seriously inflect the price upward. Since inception, the Bitcoin ecosystem has had to achieve certain levels of liquidity before it even gets on the radar of bigger pools of capital. It\u2019s like leveling up.\n\nSo, who would buy bitcoin when it\u2019s over $100k or $200k per coin? Entities that can\u2019t really buy it until it\u2019s that big, is who. And at $100,000 per bitcoin, each sat is worth a tenth of a cent.\n\nKind of like how the price of a 400 ounce gold \u201cgood delivery bar\u201d doesn\u2019t really matter for most people, the price of each full bitcoin (an arbitrary large unit) doesn\u2019t really matter. What matters is overall network size and liquidity and functionality. And what matters is whether their share of the network is preserving or growing its purchasing power over the long run, or not.\n\nLike any asset, bitcoin price is a function of supply and demand.\n\nSupply is fixed, but portions of it can be in weak hands or strong hands at any given time. During bull markets, a lot of new people excitedly buy in, and some longer-term holders trim their exposure and sell to those new buyers. During bear markets, a lot of recent buyers sell out at a loss, and the more steadfast people keep dollar-cost averaging into it, rarely if ever selling. Supply rotates from fast-money weak hands to vaulted-money strong hands that won\u2019t easily part with it. This chart shows the percentage of bitcoin that hasn\u2019t moved on-chain in over a year, along with the price of bitcoin:\n\nWhen bitcoin\u2019s supply is tight like that, it only takes a small spark of new demand and fresh capital inflows to raise the price significantly, since there won\u2019t be a big supply response function from existing holders. In other words, even a sharp price increase won\u2019t encourage much selling from those 70%+ of coins that have been held for over a year. But where does that demand come from?\n\nGenerally speaking, the biggest correlation I have found to bitcoin demand is global broad money supply, denominated in dollars. The first part, global money supply, is a measure of global credit growth and/or central bank money-printing. For the second part, the reason dollar denomination is important here is because the dollar is the global reserve currency and thus the primary unit of account for global trade, global contracts, and global debts. When the dollar strengthens, it hardens the debts of various countries. When the dollar weakens, it softens the debts of various countries. Global dollar-denominated broad money is like a big liquidity metric for the world. How quickly are fiat currency units being created? And how strong is the dollar relative to the rest of the global currency market?\n\nLook Into Bitcoin has a macro suite and as part of that, they show the rate of change of bitcoin price relative to the rate of change of global broad money, and I\u2019ve made a custom chart set out of it:\n\nBasically, we\u2019re comparing the exchange rate between two different currencies here. Bitcoin is smaller, but is getting harder over time thanks to its ongoing supply halvings and its supply cap of 21 million coins. The dollar is way bigger, and goes through periods of softening and hardening, but mostly it is softening and ever-increasing in supply with briefer periods of cyclical hardening. Both the fundamentals of bitcoin and the fundamentals of the dollar (global liquidity) affect the exchange rate between the two over time.\n\nSo when I am assessing the market capitalization and liquidity of the Bitcoin network, I am doing it in relation to global broad money and other major assets over time. It\u2019s fine for it to have major ups and downs; after all it is bootstrapping from zero to who knows what, and that comes with volatility. Price appreciation attracts leverage, which eventually causes crashes. Bitcoin has to keep going through cycles and shaking off leverage and rehypothecation if it\u2019s going to become widely adopted.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s notorious volatility is unlikely to diminish much until it\u2019s more liquid and more widely-held than it is now; there\u2019s no fix for bitcoin\u2019s volatility other than more time, more adoption, more liquidity, more understanding, and better user experience with the wallets, exchanges, and other applications. The asset itself is only changing slowly; it\u2019s the world\u2019s perception of it and the leverage built on top of it or ripped away from it that goes through manic and depressive cycles.\n\nWhat would make me concerned? If the bitcoin price were to stagnate despite a prolonged period of rising global liquidity, or if bitcoin were to fail to keep making higher highs and higher lows over a multi-year timeframe despite global liquidity doing so. We would then have to ask difficult questions about why the Bitcoin network is failing to take market share for a prolonged period of time. So far, it\u2019s quite healthy by this metric.\n\n2) Number of Conversion Points\n\nBitcoin has gone through a number of narrative transitions over its 15-year lifecycle, although the funny thing is that virtually all of them were discussed by Satoshi Nakamoto, Hal Finney, and many others back in 2009 and 2010 on the original Bitcoin Talk forums. But since then, the market has bounced around to emphasize different use-cases of the network over time.\n\nIt\u2019s like the parable of the blind men and an elephant. In the parable, three blind men are all touching an elephant; one touches the tail, one touches the side, and one touches a tusk. They all aggressively argue with each other over what they are touching, when in reality they are all touching different parts of the same thing.\n\nA big narrative that bounces back and forth in the Bitcoin ecosystem is whether it\u2019s a payment method or savings method. The answer of course is both, but the emphasis tends to change sometimes. Nakamoto\u2019s original whitepaper was about peer-to-peer electronic cash, although in his early posts he also talked about central bank monetary debasement and how bitcoin is resistant to that due to its fixed supply (i.e. useful as savings). Money does serve multiple roles, after all.\n\nDo I contradict myself?\n\nVery well then I contradict myself,\n\nI am large, I contain multitudes. -Walt Whitman\n\nBoth payments and savings are important, and both aspects strengthen each other. And because Bitcoin is mainly designed as a low-throughput network (which maximizes for decentralization), it primarily serves as a settlement network. Actual day-to-day coffee-scale transactions need to be done on higher layers of the network.\n\n-Bitcoin\u2019s ability to be sent from any internet user to any other internet user in the world is an essential part of what makes it useful. It provides the one holding it with the capability to make permissionless, censorship-resistant payments through points of friction. In fact, one of the first-ever use cases for it was well over a decade ago when Wikileaks was de-platformed by major payment platforms. Wikileaks then turned to bitcoin to continue receiving donations. Democracy advocates and human rights advocates in authoritarian regimes have made use of it by bypassing bank freezes and so forth. People have used it to evade unjust capital controls that try to keep them permanently locked into a rapidly debasing developing country currency.\n\n-Similarly, bitcoin\u2019s 21 million supply cap and its decentralized immutability that keeps its ruleset credible (including that supply cap) is what makes it attractive to hold. Most monies increase in supply over time with no limit, and even refined gold increases in supply by an average of about 1.5% per year, but bitcoin eventually does not. If people didn\u2019t want to hold it, and instead just converted back and forth from fiat currency to bitcoin briefly to make settlements/payments, then that would add all sorts of frictions, costs, and external points of censorship for the network. Paying with bitcoin or receiving payment in bitcoin works best when you actually want to hold bitcoin for the long term as well.\n\nSo, it\u2019s that blend of both payments and savings that is important. The key way to think about this is optionality. If you hold bitcoin for the long run, you have the option to bring that portion of your wealth with you anywhere in the world, or to make permissionless, censorship-resistant payments to any internet-connected person in the world if you want to or need to. Your money can\u2019t be unilaterally frozen or debased by any bank or government with a stroke of a pen. It\u2019s not stuck in one jurisdiction within narrow borders; it\u2019s global. Those features might not seem important to many Americans, but it\u2019s huge for a lot of people in the world.\n\nMany countries place capital gains taxes on bitcoin (and most other assets), meaning if people sell or spend it, they have to pay taxes relative to their cost basis, and they have to keep track of the accounting for that. That\u2019s a big piece of how countries maintain their currency monopolies. Over time, that might go away for bitcoin as it becomes highly adopted and as some countries make it legal tender. But that taxation is the reality for most places now, and that makes it less attractive to spend compared to fiat currency in many contexts. That contributes to me not particularly wanting to spend mine much, yet. But then again, I\u2019m in a jurisdiction and line of work where I rarely run into domestic payment frictions with my fiat systems.\n\nGresham\u2019s law states that given a fixed exchange rate (or I would argue, some other friction as well like a capital gains tax), people will spend the weaker money first and hoard the stronger money. In Egypt, for example, if someone has U.S. dollars and Egyptian pounds, they\u2019ll spend the Egyptian pounds and keep the U.S. dollars tucked away as savings. Or if each of my bitcoin transactions has a tax on it and my dollar transactions do not, I\u2019ll usually spend the dollars and keep my bitcoin. The Egyptian could spend the dollars and I could spend my bitcoin in many cases, but we\u2019re choosing not to.\n\nThiers\u2019 law states that when a money gets extremely weak beyond a certain point, merchants won\u2019t accept it anymore, and they\u2019ll instead demand payment in the stronger money. That\u2019s when Gresham\u2019s law gets overridden, and people have to spend their stronger money. When a currency utterly fails, those people who have been saving in dollars in those countries tend to begin spending them, with the dollar and other monies taking over the weaker currency even in the medium of exchange role.\n\nAnd in most economic environments, it\u2019s not just merchants selling goods and services that matter. It\u2019s also currency brokers. In Egypt or many developing countries, a random merchant like a restaurant might not accept dollars, even though dollars are treasured things that go for a premium within the country. Sometimes you need to convert to the local currency first in order to spend at an official merchant. Less official merchants are often more readily accepting of premium forms of payment.\n\nSuppose I bring a wad of physical U.S. dollars, a couple South African Krugerrand gold coins, or some bitcoin with me to a random country, and I don\u2019t bring my Visa cards. How could I acquire local goods and services? I can either find a merchant to accept one of those monies directly, or I can find a broker that will convert these harder monies to local currency for me at the fair local price. For that latter method, it\u2019s like I\u2019m entering an arcade or casino; I might need to convert my real globally salable money to this place\u2019s centralized monopoly play money while I\u2019m here, and then convert back out to real globally salable money when I leave. It sounds harsh but that\u2019s how it is.\n\nIn other words, what we need to know is how salable or convertible a type money is; not just how many merchants directly accept it or how much merchant volume is being done in a given currency. For a clear example, the amount of people paying for things directly in gold throughout the world is extremely low, and yet the liquidity and convertibility of gold is high; you can pretty easily find a buyer for a recognizable gold coin at fair market prices almost anywhere. Therefore, gold gives the holder quite a bit of optionality. Bitcoin is similar in that regard, but way more globally portable.\n\nMost fiat currencies are extremely liquid and salable in their own countries, accepted by virtually all merchants. But all fiat currencies except for the top handful quickly lose salability and convertibility outside of their borders; outside of their enforced monopolies. In this sense, they are like arcade tokens or casino chips. My physical Egyptian pounds and Norwegian kroner are nearly useless in New Jersey, for example, even in terms of finding a place to easily convert them:\n\nTo roughly quantify things:\n\n-The physical U.S. dollar has 10/10 salability in the United States, 7/10 salability in some countries, and maybe 5/10 salability in other countries. There\u2019s a range, but overall it\u2019s generally the most salable money in the world currently. Sometimes you can directly spend it, other times you have to convert it first, but either way there tends to be plenty of liquidity.\n\n-Most physical currencies also have 10/10 salability in their own countries, but they have either 1/10 or 2/10 salability everywhere else. It\u2019ll take quite a while and potentially a steep discount rate to find someone who will exchange value for them when they are outside of their host jurisdiction. Like an arcade token.\n\n-Gold has probably like 6/10 salability almost everywhere, which makes it one of the more salable bearer assets around, up there with the dollar. You can\u2019t spend it as easily as a country\u2019s local fiat currency, and very little spending volume happens with it overall, but in just about any country you can exchange it for liquid value easily. Gold is a globally-recognized liquid and fungible form of value.\n\n-Bitcoin has something like 6/10 salability in many urban centers of the world, similar to gold in that sense, but it drops down to 2/10 or so in many rural areas, similar to fiat currencies outside of their monopoly borders. But it\u2019s on the strong uptrend, and it has come that far from nothing in just 15 years. Plus, it can also be converted online in most countries to mobile phone data top-ups, digital gift cards that are spendable locally, and other forms of value, so the overall number of offline and online conversion points for those that bring their bitcoin around with them is substantial.\n\nThe right question to ask in my opinion is \u201cif I bring bitcoin with me, could I spend or convert it for value without much hassle?\u201d In urban centers of many countries, like South Africa or Costa Rica or Argentina or Nigeria as developing country examples, or basically any developed country, that\u2019s a pretty resounding yes. In other countries like Egypt, it\u2019s not really there yet. So what we need to monitor is the general direction.\n\nSo far, bitcoin is definitely becoming more salable/convertible over time in any given multi-year time period.\n\nThe Rise of Bitcoin Hubs\n\nIn my view, the most promising trend is the growth of many small bitcoin communities around the world. El Zonte in El Salvador was among the first, and it triggered the president of the country to notice it and make it legal tender across the whole country. But it also sparked other communities like Bitcoin Jungle in Costa Rica, Bitcoin Lake in Guatemala, Bitcoin Ekasi in South Africa, Lugano in Switzerland, F.R.E.E. Madeira, and many others that have become dense areas of bitcoin usage and acceptance. The salability and convertibility in those places and others are both rather high. These hubs just keep popping up.\n\nIn addition, Ghana has hosted the Africa Bitcoin Conference run by a woman name Farida Nabourema for two years in a row. She is an exiled democracy advocate from Togo who is deeply familiar with financial repression as a tool for authoritarianism, and is also a critic of France\u2019s neocolonialist ongoing monetary arrangement in over a dozen African countries. In addition, Indonesia now has a recurring bitcoin conference run by a woman named Dea Rezkitha. There are conferences in countries all around the world.\n\nAnd there are small organizations like Bitcoin Commons in Austin Texas, Bitcoin Park in Nashville, Pubkey in New York, and Real Bedford in the United Kingdom, that serve as local bitcoin hubs. It\u2019s becoming increasingly common that in a given city, there is a dedicated bitcoin community or recurring meet-up there. BitcoinerEvents.com and other sites help you find them, and they can serve as means of convertibility and salability as well.\n\nThere are also apps that let you find bitcoin merchants in your area. BTCMap.org for example lets you find merchants around the world that accept bitcoin. The 2023 BTC Prague conference and the 2023 Africa Bitcoin Conference had Fedi event apps. In addition to serving as a bitcoin wallet, this app provided schedules for all major events at the conference, included an interactive map that showed locations of merchants in the area that accept bitcoin as payment, and provided other services like AI assistants paid with bitcoin micro-transactions over the Lightning network. (As a disclosure, I\u2019m an investor in Fedi via Ego Death Capital).\n\nHere were some of the questions I asked it, without using a ChatGPT subscription but rather just within the bitcoin wallet app that reached out to ChatGPT via an API, and paid for by the end user (me in this case) using bitcoin:\n\n3) Technical Security and Decentralization\n\nMy friend and colleague Jeff Booth often uses the phrase \u201cAs long as Bitcoin remains secure and decentralized,\u201d before describing his future outlook on the asset and its macroeconomic implications. In other words, it\u2019s an if/else view that rests on the caveat that the network continues to operate roughly as it has for the past 15 years, and that the traits that make the Bitcoin network valuable continue to persist into the future.\n\nBitcoin isn\u2019t magic. It\u2019s a distributed network protocol. For it to continue to be valuable, it has to function through opposition and attacks, and has to be the best and most liquid way to do it. The concept of Bitcoin is insufficient to really matter for anything; it\u2019s the reality of Bitcoin that is important. If Bitcoin suffers from catastrophic hacks or gets captured and centralized and permissioned/censored, then it would cease to offer the use-case that it does now, and its value would be partially or entirely degraded.\n\nIn addition to network effects and associated liquidity, the focus on security and decentralization is largely what makes Bitcoin different from other cryptocurrency networks. It sacrifices performance in almost every other category: speed, throughput, and programmability, in order to be as simple, streamlined, secure, robust, and decentralized as possible. Its design maximizes for those traits above all else. All additional complexity must be built on layers on top of it, rather than embedded into the base layer, because embedding those traits into the base layer would sacrifice performance in those key attributes of security and decentralization.\n\nTherefore, monitoring Bitcoin\u2019s level of security and decentralization is important when building or maintaining a long-term thesis on the network\u2019s value and utility.\n\nSecurity Analysis\n\nBitcoin has had a very robust security track record for an emerging open source technology, but not a faultless one. As I wrote about in my book Broken Money, here is a list of some of the more notable technical issues it has faced so far:\n\nIn 2010 when it was still brand new and barely had a market price, the Bitcoin node client had an inflation bug, which Satoshi fixed with a soft fork. In 2013, a Bitcoin node client update was accidentally not backward-compatible with the prior (and widely used) node client due to an oversight, resulting in an unintended chain split. Within hours, developers analyzed the problem and told node operators to fall back to the prior node client, which resolved the chain split. Since that time over a decade ago, the Bitcoin network has enjoyed 100% perfect uptime. Even Fedwire has encountered outages and failed to achieve 100% uptime during that period (and doesn\u2019t even attempt to run 24/7/365 to begin with like Bitcoin does). In 2018, another inflation bug was accidentally added to the Bitcoin node client. However, this one was identified and discreetly fixed by developers before it was exploited, and so it never caused an issue in practice. In 2023, people began making use of the SegWit and Taproot soft fork upgrades in ways that were not intended by the developers of those upgrades, including inserting large images into the signature portion of the Bitcoin blockchain. While this is not a bug per se, it shows the risks of how certain aspects of the code can be used in ways that were not intended, and therefore shows the ongoing need for conservatism when performing upgrades in the future. Bitcoin suffers from the \u201cyear 2038 problem\u201d that many computer systems have. During the year 2038, the 32-bit integer used for Unix timestamping will run out of seconds for many computer systems, resulting in an error. However, because Bitcoin uses an unsigned integer for this, it won\u2019t run out until the year 2106. This can be fixed by updating the time to a 64-bit integer or by taking the block height into account when interpreting the wrapped-around 32-bit integer, but as far as I understand it this may require a hard fork, which means an upgrade that is backward-incompatible. This shouldn\u2019t be hard in practice because it\u2019s obviously necessary and can be done well in advance of the problem (years or decades even), but it may open a window of vulnerability. One potential way to do it would be to release an update that is backward-compatible at first, but that activates when the integer runs out and thus solves the problem. \u2013Broken Money, Chapter 26\n\nBitcoin can indeed rebound from technical problems. The basic solution is for node operators on the decentralized network to roll back to a prior update before the bug existed and reject the new updates that are causing the problem. However, we must imagine a worst-case scenario. If a technical issue goes unnoticed for years and becomes entrenched as part of the broad node network, and then gets found out and exploited, then that is a more catastrophic problem. It\u2019s still not unrecoverable, but it would be a serious blow.\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s codebase exists over years and decades, it hardens and benefits from the Lindy effect.\n\nOverall, the rate of major bugs has decreased over time, and the fact that the network has had 100% uptime since 2013 is remarkable.\n\nDecentralization Analysis\n\nFor decentralization, we can measure node distribution and mining distribution as key variables. A widely-distributed node network makes changing the network\u2019s rules very hard to do, because each node enforces the rules for its user. Similarly, a widely-distributed mining network makes transaction censorship harder to pull off.\n\nBitnodes identifies over 16,000 reachable Bitcoin nodes. Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr estimates that there are over 60,000 nodes when taking into account ones that are running privately.\n\nIn contrast, Ethernodes identifies about 6,000 Ethereum nodes, of which about half are hosted by cloud operators rather than run residentially. And because Ethereum nodes use too much bandwidth to run privately via Tor, that\u2019s probably close to the actual number.\n\nSo, Bitcoin is rather strong in terms of node distribution.\n\nBitcoin miners cannot change the core rules of the protocol, but they can determine what transactions make it into the network or not. So, miner centralization can increase the odds of transaction censorship.\n\nThe largest publicly-traded miner, Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) has less than 5% of the network hash rate. There are a couple other private miners roughly on that scale. And then there are various public and private miners with 1-2% of the network, and many with less. In other words, mining is indeed quite decentralized; even the largest players have tiny allocations of the network.\n\nEver since China banned bitcoin mining in 2021, the United States has been the largest mining jurisdiction, but is estimated to have less than half of mining hash rate. China is ironically still the #2 mining jurisdiction because mining is really hard to stamp out even with their level of authoritarianism. Other energy-rich countries like Canada and Russia have sizable mining infrastructure, and dozens of countries have small operations.\n\nMining companies usually direct their hashing power to mining pools. Mining pools are currently rather centralized, with two pools collectively controlling about half of transaction processing, and the top ten pools controlling virtually all of the transaction processing. I think this is an area for improvement:\n\nChart Source: Blockchain.com\n\nThere are, however, some important caveats. Firstly, mining pools do not custody the mining machines, which is a critical distinction. If a pool misbehaves, miners can easily switch to another pool. So while a few pools could work together to do a brief 51% attack on the network, their ability to sustain such an attack is likely very weak. Secondly, Stratum V2 has been rolling out recently, which allows miners to have more control of the block construction process than just letting the pools do all of the work.\n\nThe physical mining supply chain is also rather centralized. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and a few other foundries in the world serve as the key bottlenecks for most types of chip production, including the application-specific chips that bitcoin miners use. In fact, I would go so far as to say that I think pool centralization is an overrated risk, and that semiconductor foundry centralization is an underrated risk.\n\nOverall, ownership of active mining machines is very decentralized, but the fact that some countries have a large percentage of miners, that certain pools have a lot of mining power directed at them, and the mining supply chain has some centralized aspects, chips away at that mining decentralization to a moderate degree. I think mining is an area that could benefit from more development and attention even though the most important mining variable (the ownership and physical distribution of electrified mining machines) is fortunately very decentralized.\n\n4) Quality of User Experience\n\nIf Bitcoin is hard to use technically, then it mainly gets restricted to programmers, engineers, ideologues, and power users that are willing to put in time to learn it. On the other hand, if it\u2019s nearly effortless to use, it can spread to people more easily.\n\nWhen I looked at cryptocurrency exchanges back in 2013-2015, they were very sketchy looking. Nowadays it\u2019s generally easier to buy bitcoin on reputable exchanges and brokers, and with simple interfaces. And back in the early days, there were no dedicated bitcoin hardware wallets; people had to figure out how to manage their keys on their own computers typically. Most of the \u201clost bitcoins\u201d you hear about in the media were from that early era, when bitcoin was not valuable enough for people to pay close attention, and when keys were harder to manage.\n\nOver the past decade, hardware wallets have become more widespread and easier to use. Software wallets and interfaces have also improved a lot as well.\n\nOne of my favorite recent combinations is the Nunchuk+Tapsigner combo, which works well for modest amounts of bitcoin. The Tapsigner is a $30 NFC card wallet that can hold private keys offline inexpensively, while Nunchuk is a mobile or desktop wallet that can work with many hardware wallet types including Tapsigners for moderate amounts of bitcoin or full-feature hardware wallets for larger amounts of bitcoin.\n\nDecades ago, learning to use a checkbook was an important skill. Nowadays, many people get bitcoin/crypto wallets before they get bank accounts. Managing public/private key pairs is likely to become a more routine part of life, both for managing money and for signing things to differentiate real social content from fake content. It\u2019s easy to learn, and many people will grow up with the technology around them.\n\nThe number of bitcoin ATMs in the world according to Statista also increased by a factor of more than 100x from 2015 to 2022:\n\nAnd alongside ATMs, there has been a rise in voucher purchase methods, which I think is one of the reasons why the ATM numbers started to flat-line recently. Azteco was founded in 2019, and in 2023 they raised $6 million in seed capital in a funding round led by Jack Dorsey. Azteco vouchers can be purchased for cash at hundreds of thousands of retail points and online platforms, particularly across developing countries, and then redeemed for bitcoin.\n\nThe Lightning network ramped up over the past six years, and reached very usable levels of liquidity by late 2020.\n\nWebsites like Stacker News and communication protocols like Nostr also integrated the Lightning network, and this ultimately blends value transfer with information transfer. Browser plug-ins like Alby are fairly new, and have made it easy to use Lightning on multiple websites from one wallet, and can be used as a sign-on method for many of them instead of a username/password combination.\n\nOverall, the Bitcoin network has become easier and more intuitive to use over time, and from what I see in the development pipeline as a venture investor in the space, that will continue to be the case in the years ahead.\n\n5) Legal Acceptance and Global Recognition\n\n\u201cBut what if the government bans it?\u201d has been a common objection to Bitcoin since inception. Governments do enjoy their state-issued currency monopolies and capital controls, after all.\n\nHowever, when answering that question, we need to ask, \u201cwhich government?\u201d There are about 200 of them. And game theory is such that if one country bans it, another country can gain business by inviting people to come and build with them instead. One country (El Salvador) even recognizes bitcoin as a legal tender now. Some other countries are using capital from their sovereign wealth funds for bitcoin mining.\n\nAlso, some things are just really hard to stop. Back in the early 1990s, Phil Zimmerman created Pretty Good Privacy or \u201cPGP\u201d, which was an open source encryption program. It allowed people to send private information to each other over the internet, which is not something that most governments liked. After his open-source code found its way outside of the United States, the U.S. federal government launched a criminal investigation against Zimmerman for \u201cmunitions export without a license\u201d.\n\nIn response, Zimmerman published his full open-source code in a book, which gave it protection under the First Amendment. It was, after all, just a collection of words and numbers that he chose to express to others, or speech in other words. Some people including Adam Back (the creator of Hashcash, which eventually was used within Bitcoin as its proof-of-work mechanism) even began putting various encryption code on T-shirts, with the warning on the T-shirt that the shirt was classified as munitions and thus illegal to export or show to a foreign national.\n\nThe U.S. federal government indeed dropped their criminal investigation of Zimmerman, and encryption regulations were reformed. Encryption became a key part of e-commerce, since paying online requires secure encryption, and thus a lot of economic value could have been delayed or pushed elsewhere if the U.S. federal government had tried to persist beyond what was feasible.\n\nThese types of protests were successful in other words, and used the rule of law against government overreach, and also pointed to the absurdity and infeasibility of trying to restrict such concise and easily-spreadable information. Open-source code is just information, and information is hard to suppress.\n\nSimilarly, Bitcoin is free open-source code, which makes it hard to stamp out. Even restricting the hardware side is tough; China banned Bitcoin mining in 2021 but China is still the second largest mining jurisdiction. When China has trouble banning something, it\u2019s clearly not easy to ban. The software side is even stickier than that.\n\nA lot of countries have flip-flopped on banning Bitcoin, or ran into their own rule of law or division of power. In relatively free countries, government is not a monolith. Some government officials or representatives like Bitcoin, whereas others do not, and they are accountable to the people and to the rule of law.\n\n-In 2018, India\u2019s central bank banned banks from interacting with cryptocurrencies, and lobbied the government to prohibit cryptocurrency use entirely. But in 2020, India\u2019s supreme court ruled against them, which restored rights of the private sector to innovate with this technology.\n\n-In early 2021, amid a decade of persistent double-digit inflation of their own currency, Nigeria\u2019s central bank prohibited banks from interacting with cryptocurrencies, although they didn\u2019t try to illegalize it among the public because it\u2019s really hard to enforce. Instead, they launched the eNaira central bank digital currency, and clamped down on physical cash with much stricter withdraw/ATM limits, to try to corral people into their centralized digital payment systems. During the ban, Chainalysis assessed that Nigeria had the second highest cryptocurrency adoption in the world (mostly stablecoins and bitcoin), and specifically had the highest peer-to-peer trading volume in the world, which is how they got around the bank blockage. In late 2023, after nearly three years of an ineffective ban being in place, Nigeria\u2019s central bank reversed their decision and opened banks up to interacting with cryptocurrencies with regulations.\n\n-Back in 2022, amid heavy demand for cryptocurrencies by the public to defend against triple-digit inflation, some of Argentina\u2019s major banks were stepping up efforts to offer them to customers, but Argentina\u2019s government banned banks from offering them to customers. They cited the typical headline reasons of volatility, cybersecurity, and money laundering, but really it was about trying to slow the flight out of the their failing currency. And then in 2023, they went a step further by also banning fintech payment apps from offering digital assets to customers. But this started to be reversed after the election of Javier Milei, who is pro-bitcoin and in favor of the market determining what it wants to use as money. During Milei\u2019s campaign, economist Diani Mondino (now Argentina\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs) wrote that \u201cArgentina will soon be a Bitcoin haven.\u201d\n\n-For years, the United States Security Exchange Commission blocked spot bitcoin ETFs. Other countries had spot bitcoin ETFs with no issue, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission allowed bitcoin futures trading, and the SEC allowed futures-based ETFs (both long and short). The SEC even allowed a leveraged futures bitcoin ETF. But they repeatedly blocked all spot ETFs, which is the simplest type and which is what the market wanted. In 2023, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the SEC\u2019s allowance of bitcoin futures ETFs but not spot ETFs was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d, rather than based on reasonable and coherent arguments. By early 2024, several spot bitcoin ETFs began trading.\n\nThere are about 160 currencies in the world, and they have a sort of \u201cfinancial blood-brain barrier\u201d around them. They can control how much physical money (e.g. cash and gold) comes through ports of entry with tight restrictions, and they can control what currencies banks are allowed to operate in, what domestic and foreign bank wires they can make, and what denomination of currency accounts they can provide to their customers.\n\nEven if a developing market jurisdiction does allow broad access to dollar accounts, they can be dangerous for the holders. They are fractionally reserved and do not have FDIC insurance backed by the U.S. government and U.S. central bank. In other words, dollar deposits in developing country foreign banks are basically junk-rated and uninsured leveraged bond funds. During times of currency shortage, the dollar accounts can be forcibly converted to local currency at a fake exchange rate, or blocked from withdraw. If someone holds dollars in a domestic bank account in a country where hyperinflation occurs, they are unlikely to be getting most or any of their dollars back either.\n\nThese 160 different fiat currencies can be a real problem for a lot of people. Latin America has over 30 currencies. Africa has over 40 currencies. All of those financial borders are frictions for trade, and all of those financial borders keep people partially locked into rapidly-devaluing currency units.\n\nIn other words, if I want to pay a graphic designer from a developing country using various traditional payment methods, and they want to receive dollars rather than their local rapidly-devaluing currency, their government and banking system can block the transfer and make them receive it in local currency in any number of ways. And they can set an artificial exchange rate as well. It\u2019s tightly controlled:\n\nBut if that graphic designer elects to be paid in bitcoin or dollar stablecoins, I could send it to them with a QR code on a video call, or over a DM or email, and it goes around their banking system. For legal reasons I wouldn\u2019t send it to a country with sanctions (it would be too risky for me to do), but I\u2019m happy to do it if they\u2019re in a country that is legally acceptable for Americans to send money to and where the primary friction is on their side, which represents the vast majority of countries.\n\nAdditionally, someone can bring unlimited amounts of bitcoin and stablecoins with them globally just by having a private key. They could write it down in their luggage, store it on a device, memorize twelve words that represent the key, or stick it in a password-protected encrypted cloud file temporarily, and thus bring unlimited value density through any port of entry.\n\nI see signs at airports that say, \u201cNo cash over $10,000\u201d and chuckle to myself, because they have no way of knowing who in the line has ten million dollars or any other arbitrary value of bitcoin or stablecoins accessible to them in some way.\n\nWith this technology, those 160 financial borders that separate us all are increasingly porous. Trying to stamp out bitcoin or stablecoins or similar stuff is like trying to build sand walls to hold back the ocean tide. The ability to transfer money around banks, between any internet-connected parties, opens up global competition between monies.\n\nThis is good for most people. It\u2019s only bad for people who rent-seek off the top, constantly dilute peoples\u2019 savings and wages and channel that value toward themselves and their cronies, and that rely on obfuscation rather than transparency to finance themselves. Capital naturally flows to places with good legal protections and rule of law, and technology makes that process quicker and smoother, and makes it accessible to the working class and middle class rather than just the wealthy.\n\nThere mere holding and using of bitcoin puts governments in an awkward place if they try to ban it, especially governments that have any semblance of rule of law. They have to argue that it\u2019s a bad thing for there to exist money that can\u2019t be debased and that people can hold themselves and send to others. Or another way of putting it, they have to make the case that a decentralized spreadsheet is a threat to national security, and that such a dangerous thing as that must be banned under threat of imprisonment.\n\nInstead, the biggest legal challenges for the Bitcoin network ahead are likely in the area of privacy, and by major governments like the United States. Governments really don\u2019t want people to have any sort of financial privacy, especially at scale. Financial privacy was the default for most of history, but in recent decades it\u2019s increasingly not.\n\nThe premise from their perspective is that in order to prevent the 1% of bad people from doing terrorist financing or human trafficking or other bad things, 100% of people have to give up their rights to financial privacy and allow the government to surveil all transactions between all parties. In addition, governments have shifted much of their revenue toward income taxes, which rely on ubiquitous surveillance of all payment flows to enforce. But of course, such a thing can lead to massive overreach, and with grave consequences.\n\nIn addition, we live in an age of surveillance capitalism. We are offered myriad free services by corporations if we sign away our digital soul, meaning all of our data. What we look at, and what we spend on, is very valuable commercial information. And governments enhance this and help make it the norm because they plug into the back-end and collect that data too. Sometimes it could be for national security reasons, and other times it could be to try to control the whole population (e.g. China\u2019s social credit scores).\n\nHowever, the ability for people to self custody their own money, and send money to others, and do it in such a way that corporations can\u2019t surveil it and governments can\u2019t surveil it or debase it, is an important check on power. For corporations, there are plenty of reasons to not want them to surveil us, not least being that they are often hacked and spill that data onto the dark web. And for governments, rather than being able to surveil and freeze funds without probable cause in sweeping manner in ways that benefit them, these sorts of technologies force them to have probable cause before using targeted enforcement, which comes with cost and legal procedure.\n\nIn the 19th century and before, financial privacy was the norm because most exchange occurred via cash and coins, and there wasn\u2019t any significant technology to monitor that. The idea of monitoring everyone\u2019s transactions was a type of science fiction. Starting in the late 19th century and especially throughout the 20th century, people increasingly used banks for their savings and payments, and those banks were increasingly centralized and surveilled by governments. The telecommunication age, and the age of modern banking that it contributed to, enabled ubiquitous financial surveillance to become normal. Governments mostly didn\u2019t have to enforce privacy controls on individuals; they mainly just had to enforce them on banks, which is easy and happens behind the scenes. The rise of factories and corporations brought people off of farms and into cities, earning paychecks that they receive in their bank accounts, with taxes automatically withdrawn, and with all of their financial activities easily surveilled.\n\nHowever, as computer processing, encryption, and telecommunications kept improving, eventually Bitcoin was created and allowed for peer-to-peer pseudonymous value transfer. The more widespread Bitcoin and adjacent technologies become, and particularly private layers and methods on top of them, the more untenable it becomes for governments to maintain that existing centralized surveillance apparatus. People can begin opting out, but governments won\u2019t make it easy. They are now trying to impose bank-type surveillance and reporting requirements on individuals, which is orders of magnitude more difficult to enforce than on institutions.\n\nI suspect that there will be more Zimmerman-like conflicts in the years ahead, but this time for financial privacy. Governments will increasingly tighten these frictions around people using various privacy-preserving methods, up to and including trying to criminalize them, and the defense to such overreach is that many of them are open-source. They\u2019re just information. To restrict their creation and their usage by people who are not otherwise committing crimes, requires criminalizing the usage of words and numbers in a certain order. It\u2019s both hard to legally justify in jurisdictions that have free speech, and hard to enforce in practice because open-source code spreads rather easily. And in the United States and certain other jurisdictions, well-funded lawsuits can push back on these laws as being unconstitutional. So, I expect that period to be messy.\n\nFinal Grade: A-\n\nGrading the network is kind of a joke since it\u2019s not really quantifiable, but basically most aspects of the network are either getting better or are staying roughly the same.\n\nThe areas where we can subtract points and thus bring it down to an A- rather than an A or A+, is that miner decentralization could be better (particularly with regard to pools and ASIC production), and overall user experience and second layer application/ecosystem development could be further along than it is now. For that second item, I\u2019d like to see more and better wallets, more seamless usage of higher layers on the network, more adoption of built-in privacy features, and so forth.\n\nIf Bitcoin enters a sustained period of higher fees, as it has been in lately, then I think those second layer developments will accelerate. When fees are low, people are more likely to use the base layer and have less reason to use higher-layer solutions. When fees are high, various existing use-cases get stress tested, and users and capital gravitate toward what is working or what is being demanded.\n\nAdditionally, governments have generally been pulled, sometimes willingly and sometimes with protest, toward accepting it to some degree. However, the battle ahead is likely around privacy, and in my view that\u2019s nowhere near being finished yet. If anything it\u2019s just heating up.\n\nOverall, I continue to view the Bitcoin network as being highly investable, both in bitcoin directly as an asset, and in the equity of companies building on top of the network.\n\nThere are still areas of risk, but they represent areas of potential improvement and contribution. Part of what makes the Bitcoin network powerful, is that its open source aspect makes it so that anyone can audit the code and propose refinements to it, anyone can build layers on top of it that attach to it, and anyone can build applications that interact with it and enhance it for users."

        "content": "Blockchain hit the market in 2009 with the launch of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. In the context of bitcoin, the technology is an immutable and tamper-proof public ledger of transactions. Businesses have been looking to put these principles to use in other applications for blockchain, which is sometimes referred to as distributed ledger technology.\n\nOne of the concerns about the AI models \u2014 the kind that underpin applications like ChatGPT \u2014 is that the data they are trained on could contain biases or misinformation. That means the answers an AI system may give would contain those biases and false information.\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Blockchain could be used to prevent bias in the data that artificial intelligence models are being trained on \u2014 and that could be a \"killer use case\" for the technology, executives told CNBC.\n\nIn the case of AI, training data can be put on the blockchain. That will allow the developers of the AI system to keep track of the data that the model has been trained on.\n\nCasper Labs, a business-focused blockchain firm, partnered with IBM this month to create such a system.\n\n\"The product that we are developing, the datasets are actually checkpointed and stored on the blockchain so you have a proof of how the AI is trained,\" Medha Parlikar, chief technology officer and co-founder of Casper Labs, told CNBC during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week.\n\n\"And so as you use the AI, if it's learning and you find that the AI is starting to hallucinate, you can actually roll back the AI. And so you can undo some of the learning and go back to a previous version of the AI.\"\n\nHallucinations broadly refer to when an AI system gives out false information.\n\nBlockchain is a technology that has been spoken about for many years, and a host of industries ranging from finance to health care have been looking at ways to use it.\n\nSheila Warren, the CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, said, however, that a blockchain-based AI training data ledger could be the \"killer use case\" for the technology.\n\n\"I actually do think that the verification of an AI and sort of the checks and balances ... within an AI system, are going to be blockchain driven and blockchain backed,\" Warren told CNBC during the panel."

        "title": "1 Top Bitcoin ETF to Buy Before the Crypto Market Soars 300%, According to a Wall Street Analyst - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is currently worth $1.6 trillion, and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) accounts for 50% of that total. Bitcoin dominance (i.e., the market value attributable to Bitcoin) was also 50% five years ago, though it has ranged from 38% to 70% during that time period.\n\nWith that in mind, Morningstar analyst Michael Miller expects the cryptocurrency market to soar 300% to $6.4 trillion by 2032. If Bitcoin dominance stays at 50%, the implied upside for Bitcoin would also be 300%. Alternatively, the implied upside would be closer to 200% if Bitcoin dominance slipped to 38%, and the implied upside would be closer 460% if Bitcoin dominance increased to 70%.\n\nRegardless, cryptocurrency bulls have good reason to invest in Bitcoin, and that can be done in a few ways. The most obvious method is a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN). But creating and managing an account may be a headache, especially for investors with existing brokerage accounts.\n\nFortunately, a new type of investment product eliminates that friction: spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs reduce friction for investors\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, funds that track the price of Bitcoin. That landmark decision could draw more retail and institutional investors to the market, and the influx of capital could drive the price of Bitcoin much higher in the years ahead.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs are particularly attractive because they eliminate the headache of managing multiple accounts. Investors no longer need to buy Bitcoin through a specialized exchange, nor do they have to worry about storing the cryptocurrency with a blockchain wallet. Instead, spot Bitcoin ETFs make it possible to add Bitcoin exposure to existing brokerage accounts. That convenience is why spot Bitcoin ETFs could drive the price of the cryptocurrency higher.\n\nFor context, analysts at Bernstein believe the price per Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by 2025, implying 252% upside from its current price of $42,600. Similarly, analysts at Standard Chartered Bank believe the price per Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by 2025, implying 369% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe best (and worst) spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\nGenerally speaking, all spot Bitcoin ETFs do the same thing. They purchase Bitcoin from a cryptocurrency exchange (often Coinbase), divide the Bitcoin into shares, and sell those shares on the stock market. In other words, this is not a situation where a team of experienced asset managers could create substantial value for fund holders by trading the right securities at the right times.\n\nFor that reason, buy-and-hold investors should focus on fees or expense ratios. As mentioned, the SEC has approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, but fees vary widely between certain funds, as detailed below:\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: BITB): 0.20%\n\nArk 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKB): 0.21%\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (NYSEMKT: FBTC): 0.25%\n\niShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT): 0.25%\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (NASDAQ: BRRR): 0.25%\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: HODL): 0.25%\n\nFranklin Templeton Digital Trust (NYSEMKT: EZBC): 0.29%\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: BTCW): 0.3%\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BATS-CHIXE: BTCO): 0.39%\n\nHashdex Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: DEFI): 0.94%\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: GBTC): 1.5%\n\nPersonally, I would eliminate the bottom half of that list based on fees alone, and none more so than the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. There is simply no reason to pay 1.5% for an ETF -- that means investors would pay $15 annually on every $1,000 invested -- when an identical product could be purchased for a fraction of that cost.\n\nNext, I would consider the issuer behind the ETF. Several funds listed above are run by asset managers with plenty of experience, including Ark Invest and Fidelity. But the iShares Bitcoin Trust would be my top choice, because the fund is run by BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world.\n\nTo be clear, the issuer should matter very little, but ETFs run by larger asset managers may be less prone to liquidity problems arising from insufficient demand. For instance, the iShares Bitcoin Trust finished Jan. 18 at a 0.08% premium to its net asset value. That means investors are valuing the ETF at a 0.08% premium to the price of Bitcoin. That points to strong demand. Conversely, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust traded at a 0.27% discount to its net asset value, which hints at weaker demand.\n\nHere's the bottom line: I would avoid spot Bitcoin ETFs with an expense ratio above 0.25%, and I would absolutely avoid the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, simply because there are less expensive alternatives. Building on that, I would feel comfortable buying the spot Bitcoin ETFs run by Ark, BlackRock, and Fidelity, but the iShares Bitcoin Trust would be my first choice.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bitcoin wasn't one of them.

On X/Twitter, a disgruntled faction of the cryptocurrency community cried foul over the alleged heresy of a Bitcoin product custodied and marketed by the likes of BlackRock. The most common objection seems to be that \u201cBitcoin doesn\u2019t need an ETF\u201d and that using intermediaries to purchase it\u2014particularly ones from Wall Street\u2014perverts the ideal of decentralization.\n\nOn the more extreme end, people like self-described researcher \u201cChris Blec\u201d went so far to as to suggest that BlackRock and others might conspire to alter Bitcoin\u2019s core features. And OG Bitcoiner Max Keiser warned of a scenario where the Bitcoins held by ETFs get confiscated by the U.S. government.\n\nThis outcry is misguided. A Bitcoin ETF is a great thing for furthering the original mission of the Bitcoin project, and it\u2019s safe bet that Satoshi Nakamoto\u2014wherever he is\u2014is nodding happily at this new tool to acquire his creation.\n\nRecall Bitcoin is meant to be a type of peer-to-peer digital cash that can\u2019t be usurped by the whims of any intermediary. And if Bitcoin is meant to enable individuals to be their own bank, an ETF strengthens its case as a store of value. The way a store of value works is that you buy it with excess savings and sell it when you need to consume it at a later point. The way a censorship-resistant, seizure-resistant store of value works is that you buy it when you need the protection it affords you and sell it when you don\u2019t. In other words, people willing to hold Bitcoin without needing its raison d\u2019etre render a valuable service to those who do need it.\n\nI buy Bitcoin largely because other people will accept it. If I were living in an authoritarian regime, I would prefer to buy Bitcoin over the local currency because I know it has a global market outside of the capital controls destroying my wealth. Knowing there is a Bitcoin market that caters to even the most straight-laced investors in the world\u2019s largest capital market only strengthens that case.\n\nBitcoin was engineered for censorship resistance and portability, which means it can be taken anywhere in the world. Keeping Bitcoin safe is a matter of keeping a string of characters a secret, one that could reside in your head if need be. It\u2019s a sad sign of the times that this feature of Bitcoin is becoming more important as capricious government policies leave more and more people \u201cunbanked.\u201d Even sadder is that the use cases for Bitcoin have grown due to armed conflict and massive capital flight in recent years.\n\nBitcoin holders have always rendered a service to Bitcoin needers. Over the last decade, companies like Coinbase and Kraken have made it easy to set up accounts on their exchanges to buy a Bitcoin or a fraction of a Bitcoin. It\u2019s fair to wonder what the market is for Bitcoin ETF buyers in 2024.\n\nUnder existing regulations, it\u2019s much simpler for an ETF to be held in an IRA or a 401k than any type of crypto token because the issuers of these assets are audited in a way that\u2019s compatible with the requirements of modern financial services. Thus, ETFs can broaden the market by appealing to a different segment of potential consumers. What\u2019s more, fewer bad experiences with security and liquidity for the average Bitcoin owner mean better outcomes for the industry\u2019s reputation. For years, journalists have breathlessly covered stories about lost fortunes due to user error\u2014and come up with creative accounting methods to exaggerate their impact.\n\nTo put it another way, spot Bitcoin ETFs help solve the last-mile problem for cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency market has, to date, been saturated by ideologues and gamblers. The appearance of audited vehicles holding Bitcoin creates more liquidity globally without alienating potential users by burdening them with esoterica that early ideologues (like me) readily tolerated. Instead of making a commitment to finding security solutions that usually resemble a Rube Goldberg machine, the marginally interested, crypto-curious consumer can now enjoy an easy entry into this grand experiment. Bitcoin may not need an ETF, but it certainly needs an alternative to safety deposit boxes and Ledger devices.\n\nAverage folks, not just the tech savvy, who are Bitcoin-curious can now contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s liquidity by dipping their toe into the ETF pool. Ultimately, this should be celebrated by even Bitcoin\u2019s most old school believers\u2014not to mention the people using it as a lifeline.\n\nKathleen Breitman is a cofounder of Tezos.

        "title": "Here Come the Million-Dollar Price Targets for Bitcoin. Should We Believe Any of Them? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Due to all the bullish enthusiasm around Bitcoin (BTC -4.56%) and the new spot Bitcoin ETFs, it's unsurprising that we're starting to see some very aggressive price estimates for Bitcoin. The one that is getting all the attention, of course, is the new $1.5 million forecast from Cathie Wood and Ark Invest.\n\nWhile $1.5 million might sound like an impossibly high pie-in-the-sky number for a single cryptocurrency token, you'd be surprised at how easy it is to find million-dollar price estimates for Bitcoin. In fact, you can find $10 million, $100 million, and even $1 billion forecasts for Bitcoin. So, just how realistic are any of these price estimates?\n\nPast results are no guarantee of future performance\n\nThe most common approach for coming up with a $1 million price target, quite simply, is to look at how Bitcoin has behaved in the past and then extrapolate how it might behave in the future. Once you examine the price history of Bitcoin, you'll quickly see how easy this is. For example, it took Bitcoin approximately six months to 10x in value from $1 to $10, another six months to 10x from $10 to $100, and another six months to 10x from $100 to $1,000.\n\nSo, you can see where I'm going with this. If you rely entirely on past performance, you could fall into the trap of assuming Bitcoin can routinely increase in price by 10x every six months or so. At a current price of $50,000, that gets you to a price of $500,000 by mid-2024. If you assume Bitcoin can double in price over the following six months, then voil\u00e0! You've arrived at $1 million in Bitcoin by the end of the year. Congratulations!\n\nThere are different variants of this approach, of course. One of them involves considering the halving, a blockchain-specific event that occurs only once every four years. As a result of this halving, Bitcoin tends to skyrocket in value. If you examine the history of three previous halving events and assume Bitcoin will perform similarly after the next halving event (scheduled for April), you can come up with some dizzying price assumptions for Bitcoin.\n\nMarket sizing comparisons\n\nAnother approach to creating a $1 million price for Bitcoin involves market sizing comparisons. By comparing the value of Bitcoin to the value of another well-known financial asset, you can come up with some pretty impressive numbers.\n\nFor example, since Bitcoin is often referred to as \"digital gold,\" it could make sense to compare the market value of Bitcoin (currently around $1 trillion) to the value of all the physical gold in the world (which is about $13.7 trillion). If you buy into the argument that \"digital gold\" will eventually crowd out \"physical gold\" as a store of value, then you've found a very clever way to show that the value of Bitcoin could increase by a factor of anywhere from 10x to 15x. That gets you to a $500,000 price for Bitcoin pretty quickly.\n\nBut do the numbers make sense?\n\nMy concern is that, at some point, the numbers stop making sense. For example, given the current circulating coin supply of 20 million for Bitcoin, a target price of $1 million assumes a market valuation of $20 trillion for Bitcoin.\n\nBut think about that number for a second. That $20 trillion is nearly 7x the market cap of the world's most valuable publicly traded company (Microsoft or Apple, take your pick). It's approximately equal to the annual gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States. And it's roughly half the combined value of the S&P 500, now estimated at $40 trillion.\n\nIn short, a $20 trillion valuation for Bitcoin is possible only if there is a huge shock of some kind to the entire U.S. economy. Unfortunately, that probably means a market crash of some kind. In such a scenario, money would presumably flow out of dollar-denominated financial assets and into Bitcoin very rapidly.\n\nCathie Wood's $1.5 million price forecast\n\nWith all credit to Cathie Wood, I think she has the best $1 million valuation model for Bitcoin. It's based on looking at Bitcoin's use cases, extrapolating future growth prospects, and then aggregating the values of these different use cases. And the math behind the model is completely transparent and publicly available, so you can check the numbers yourself.\n\nThat said, I have a hard time seeing Bitcoin hitting $1 million anytime soon. Sure, Bitcoin might be trading around $1 million sometime within the next decade. But just be careful about listening to anyone who tells you that the price of Bitcoin is skyrocketing to $1 million in 2024 simply because Wall Street now has Bitcoin ETFs to sell you."

        "title": "Time to Choose: Which Bitcoin ETFs Stand Out in the Early Going, and How Different Are the Winners? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "At long last, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a handful of applications to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reflecting the spot price of Bitcoin (BTC -4.85%) tokens. Investors now have access to 11 Bitcoin-based ETFs, allowing exposure to the largest cryptocurrency even in account types that don't offer crypto-trading. And there was much rejoicing.\n\nIt's still early, but the hopeful field of Bitcoin ETF options has already started separating the wheat from the chaff. Four of the 11 funds stand head and shoulders over the rest with far more trading action and larger Bitcoin portfolios under management one week later.\n\nEach fund offers a unique spin on the idea of Bitcoin-based ETFs. Some of the lagging options may offer interesting features, but their market footprint is too small for proper coverage under The Fool's disclosure policy and general publishing guidelines. Stocks and cryptocurrencies with market caps below $200 million are below the coverage threshold, and the same limit applies to the net asset value (NAV) of ETFs. Most of the new Bitcoin names sit far below that level.\n\nSo let's take a deeper look at the four early winners instead. I'm doing this for your benefit, dear reader, but also for my own. Regular readers might recall that I might switch my own Bitcoin-fund holdings currently parked in the just-converted Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -5.76%), since that particular option comes with above-average annual fees. So what you're about to read will show you how and why I'd pick an alternative and make the jump -- or not, as the case may be.\n\nThe early winners, by the numbers\n\nETF Name and Ticker Net Asset Value (NAV) Average Daily Volume (number of shares) Annual Management Fees Grayscale Bitcoin Trust $25.2 billion 7.7 million 1.5% (No introductory fee waiver) iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT -5.82%) $698 million 22.4 million 0.25% (Introductory rate of 0.12% for the first year or first $5.0 billion assets under management (AUM)) Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust (BITB -5.80%) $355 million 3.1 million 0.2% (Introductory 0% rate for the first 6 months or first $1.0 billion AUM) Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB -5.69%) $279 million 3.4 million 0.21% (Introductory 0% rate for the first 6 months or first $1.0 billion AUM)\n\nWhat's wrong with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust?\n\nAs you can see, Grayscale's fund is far larger than the others. It's the only asset on this list that was converted from a mutual fund format instead of created from scratch last week. As such, it has built up a massive Bitcoin portfolio over the last 11 years.\n\nGrayscale has been fighting for the ETF classification for years, filing the first such application in October 2021. The old mutual fund format lacks the advanced price management features of a modern ETF, so Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust didn't always reflect the true value of its underlying cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nFor instance, the fund often traded at a generous premium to its Bitcoin value -- averaging 40% in the 6-year period between 2015 and 2020 -- before swinging to a deep discount in 2021. The fund's price dipped to an average 49% rebate from December 2022 to May 2023, as investors feared that the ETF conversion might never come:\n\nI built my Grayscale investment by buying in thirds on the outskirts of that ideal period, at discounts ranging from 25% to 40%. An important part of my investment thesis was that the full-fledged ETF would finally match the true market value of Grayscale's substantial Bitcoin holdings, and that's exactly what happened. Over the last 5 market days, the ETF has traded as a minimal discount of roughly 1%.\n\nSo far, so good. Now I'm effectively holding a Bitcoin investment in an account that doesn't offer any form of direct cryptocurrency trading. And there was much rejoicing.\n\nBut then it turns out that Grayscale's sector-leading ETF also comes with the highest management fees of any Bitcoin ETF. These annual expenses were reportedly a sticking point in negotiations for that precious SEC approval, and the firm agreed to lower its annual fee from 2% to 1.5% just two days before the final approval.\n\nMy first thought was to leave my Grayscale investment alone. A 1.5% fee may be high compared to the single-digit rates and even lower introductory fees seen in other Bitcoin ETFs, but it's small potatoes next to the potential gains of a long-term Bitcoin investment. Wouldn't trading fees and capital gains taxes undermine or even overwhelm the savings I'd see from moving to a cheaper option, anyway?\n\nAnd then it struck me. Like most modern brokerages, my trading platform doesn't charge any fees or commissions on ordinary trades in stocks or ETFs. Furthermore, that basket of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares is in a traditional IRA retirement account where taxes are levied on withdrawal and the trades along the way don't incur any additional tax charges.\n\nIn other words, I shouldn't let taxation issues limit my efforts to optimize that Bitcoin ETF position. So now I'm leaning toward making that move, squeezing the last drop of available returns from my IRA-based Bitcoin investment.\n\nGoodbye, Grayscale. What are my options?\n\nGrayscale's high management fees may be a mistake since the fund's net asset value has declined in the early going while lower-priced options posted substantial growth instead. Hence, it's time to eat Sir Robin's minstrels and look at the other three winners. Are there any game-changing differences between the iShares, Bitwise, and Ark Invest alternatives?\n\nThe iShares fund comes with a robust early uptake, building nearly a billion-dollar Bitcoin bucket in just a few days. That's hardly surprising, given the iShares series' solid reputation, competitive fees, and financial backing of its parent company, colossal investing services firm BlackRock BLK -2.08% )\n\nBitwise's fund offers the lowest fees once all the introductory rebate offers expire. Furthermore, this isn't a financial services firm dabbling in Bitcoin, but a cryptocurrency expert taking a swing at ETFs. I see that as an upside, but your mileage may vary. Bitwise also leans into its cryptocurrency focus by pledging to donate a portion of the ETF's profits to Bitcoin developers. Some critics see this as Bitwise attempting to gain some control over Bitcoin's future direction. I see a helpful effort to support the blockchain infrastructure behind the whole Bitcoin system, which should be a good thing. Finally, I kind of expected this firm to manage its own Bitcoin transactions and asset custody, as Fidelity does, but that's not the case. Bitwise leaves that duty to the Coinbase (COIN -7.17%) Custody service -- the same custodian used by every ETF in the table above. Still, low fees and deep cryptocurrency expertise make Bitwise a tempting option.\n\nThen there's the Ark 21Share fund, managed by Cathie Wood and her team of growth-stock experts. This ETF is barely large enough to merit coverage so far, offering a middle-of-the-road fee schedule and no eye-catching special features. Buying Ark's Bitcoin ETF is essentially a vote of confidence in Cathie Wood's team and its ability to effectively manage a plain-vanilla digital assets ETF in the long run.\n\nSo where will I go and what should I recommend for you, dear reader? I'm tempted to reinvest my Grayscale Bitcoin Trust holdings in the Bitwise fund, thanks to its low fees and commitment to supporting the Bitcoin development community. The Ark option was the runner-up for me, as the fund is nearly identical to the iShares alternative but with a lighter fee schedule. In another ETF race, the minimal fees of a Vanguard fund would always be a top choice but that firm sees no value in Bitcoin and won't launch an ETF in this sector anytime soon.\n\nThere you have it; I'll probably move my Grayscale investment over to the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF trust in a few days. The disclosure policy I mentioned earlier limits me from buying or selling any of these assets a few days before and after publishing articles about them, so I can't do anything today. You, on the other hand, are free to pick your favorite Bitcoin ETF and grab a few shares, as you might with any normal stock. Again, I'd recommend the Bitwise or Ark 21Share alternatives, depending on whether you crave Bitwise's developer support or not. Both Bitcoin ETFs offer rock-bottom annual fees.\n\nAnd there was much rejoicing."

        "title": "Is Coinbase in the Crosshairs? The Multimillion-Dollar Dilemma It Faces as Bitcoin ETFs Surge in Popularity. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Before Jan. 10, the only means of gaining true Bitcoin (BTC -4.85%) exposure was by directly purchasing the cryptocurrency off of an exchange, such as Coinbase Global (COIN -7.17%). But now investors can buy shares of one of 11 newly approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through conventional brokerages.\n\nThis has created some concern that the ETFs could jeopardize one of Coinbase's main uses and source of income. However, this assumption fails to paint the full picture. Here's why the ETFs will likely be a net gain for Coinbase over the long term.\n\nThe new ETF landscape\n\nWith a crowded field of choices, investors have several options for picking which new Bitcoin ETF they want to buy. Recognizing this, providers are in the midst of a fee war in an attempt to remain competitive and attract buyers.\n\nThe majority of the ETFs have an expense ratio of 0% and offer fees lower than 0.4%, and some are waiving fees for a period of time. Compared to Coinbase, which charges anywhere from 1.5% to nearly 4% depending on the method of payment, cost-oriented investors would clearly opt for Bitcoin exposure via an ETF.\n\nHere lies the potential problem concerned investors are pointing out. Based on the most recent earnings statement, Bitcoin transaction fees made up around 17% of Coinbase's total revenue. Historically, this number has tended to hover around 18% to 20%.\n\nWhile Coinbase offers investors the ability to store purchased Bitcoins on a digital wallet, rather than merely owning shares of an ETF, this isn't a priority for everybody. For many investors, simply having exposure to the cryptocurrency in the form of an ETF is enough and the low fees make them an even better option. As these new ETFs become more popular among institutional and retail investors, Coinbase faces the likely reality that revenue from Bitcoin transactions will decline. But not all hope should be lost.\n\nHow Coinbase benefits from the ETFs\n\nOne of the more overlooked aspects of the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is the role that Coinbase plays. While media attention focused on the big names sponsoring the new funds -- like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco -- a detail was glossed over.\n\nOut of the 11 Bitcoin ETFs now trading on the stock market, Coinbase serves as the custodian for eight of them. This means that Coinbase will benefit from two fees it charges. As the ETF providers buy and sell Bitcoins, Coinbase will receive a 0.2% fee. In addition, it also charges a fee to store those Bitcoins, with a varying cost structure depending on the total value in custody, ranging from 0.1% 0.2 %.\n\nThese might sound like minuscule numbers, but when considering just how much interest these ETFs have garnered in a short amount of time, those small percentages could begin to add up. Admittedly, we are still in the early days of Bitcoin's arrival on Wall Street, but it remains hard to dismiss just how much activity they are generating. Over the first three days of trading, the ETFs registered over $10 billion in volume. Furthermore, two of them -- BlackRock's and Fidelity's -- at the time of this writing ranked in the top five of total inflow among all ETFs during the past week.\n\nPopularity of the ETFs trickled to Coinbase's platform as well. On the day the ETFs were approved, it registered more than $7.5 billion in Bitcoin transactions as investor interest skyrocketed. It was the second-largest single day of trading in the company's history.\n\nQuantifying the impact\n\nIt's difficult to get hard numbers given the newness of the ETFs, but extrapolation of known fees and projected activity can shed some light on just how much money Coinbase could generate from its integral role.\n\nOne analyst firm estimates up to $30 million in custody fees annually for Coinbase. That isn't very much, considering that during the first three quarters of 2023 it generated over $2 billion in revenue. Yet this assessment overlooks one crucial aspect.\n\nCoinbase charges custodial fees based on the total dollar value held in each account. Not the total number of Bitcoins. This holds significant implications over the long term. Should Bitcoin continue its journey of price appreciation -- a reasonable assumption due to its scarcity and current trajectory -- the underlying value of the funds held in custody will appreciate. Should Bitcoin double in price, Coinbase will see those fees double as well. If there is anything Bitcoin's short 15-year history has proved, it's that increases of this size can be a piece of cake.\n\nThe other aspect that remains even more difficult to quantify, but holds greater implications, is the ripple effect that will occur in the wake of the approval of these ETFs. There is truly no way to estimate how significant of an impact they will have, but one fact remains certain: The approval stands as a momentous accomplishment in Bitcoin's evolution and holds the potential to accelerate market adoption among institutions and eventually trickle down to retail investors. As we saw with the trading surge on its platform in the days after the ETFs got the green light, the legitimization of Bitcoin and crypto in general will inevitably attract more activity and cushion Coinbase's bottom line.\n\nConsidering the long term\n\nWhile the threat of ETFs stealing Bitcoin transaction revenue warrants concern, the reality is that Coinbase's role as a custodian and position as an industry leader should prove capable of offsetting any declines. But of most importance is the landmark that the ETF approval is.\n\nNow the world's most valuable cryptocurrency has a home on Wall Street, and some of the biggest names in the financial industry want a piece of it. As interest in other cryptocurrencies grows and development of new use cases progresses, Coinbase remains one of the key beneficiaries of crypto's evolution."

        "content": "Ark Invest, founded by money manager Cathie Wood, added more units of its own spot Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded fund on Friday, taking the week\u2019s accumulation to $44 million.\n\nWhat Happened: Ark bought 316,526 units of ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (CBOE: ARKB) on Friday, and the value of the purchase based on the ETF\u2019s closing price of $41.73 was $13.21 million. At the same time, Ark sold 510,337 units of ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSE:BITO) valued at $10.25 million.\n\nBITO seeks to generate returns corresponding to the performance of Bitcoin by investing in Bitcoin futures contracts. On the other hand, ARKB is among the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs the SEC approved recently. Unlike BITO, ARKB invests directly in Bitcoin.\n\nIn multiple pair trades, the Wood-run firm bought AKRB and sold BITO in three out of the four sessions of the holiday-shortened week.\n\nThe total ARKB units Ark bought this week was 1,047,648, worth $44.09 billion, while it sold 2,026,916 units of BITO valued at $41.06 million.\n\nSee Also: What Is A Spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nA pair trade is a market-neutral strategy in which a trader bets two or more securities will diverge or converge in price. Technically, it is shorting one security while going long on another so that the bet is hedged against losses in any of the security.\n\nAs of Friday, ARKB had $309.66 million worth of Bitcoin in its holding, which is comprised 100% of the apex crypto.\n\nWood is a Bitcoin bull and expects the crypto to hit $1.5 million by 2030.\n\nProfiting From AMD Strength? Ark, through its Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW) on Friday sold 45,052 shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), with the sale likely fetching the firm $7.85 million.\n\nAMD closed Friday\u2019s session at $174.23, up 7.11%, according to Benzinga Pro data. The stock added nearly 19% for the week after sell-side analysts placed confidence in the company as one that is best positioned to profit out of the second wave of AI.\n\nThree analysts raised their price targets for AMD this week while maintaining their bullish recommendations.\n\nRead Next: Elon Musk Goes \u2018Wow\u2019 After Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood Points Out Bitcoin Is \u2018Backed By The Largest Computer Network\u2019\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock"

        "title": "Why is Bitcoin Price Dropping Despite ETF Approval? - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Zameer is a financial analyst and writer with a particular interest in cryptocurrency markets. He has been studying cryptocurrencies and their market behavior for several years and deeply understands the factors that affect the price of cryptocurrencies. His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nAfter introducing Bitcoin ETFs, the crypto market fell from $1.82 trillion to $1.66 trillion. Ethereum and other coins rose as Bitcoin\u2019s dominance fell below 50%. Bitcoin hovered around $42,500, with traders eyeing purchases below $40,000.\n\nExperts believe the immediate impact of the Bitcoin ETF approval is mostly over, expecting a more stable market. Despite the approval, Bitcoin\u2019s value unexpectedly dropped by 17.7% in the past week, reaching $40,500 from nearly $49k on January 11, despite the entry of major players like BlackRock.\n\nFactors Leading to Bitcoin Downtrend\n\nTo understand this sudden downturn, market intelligence firm IntoTheBlock analyzed on-chain data. They observed continuous inflows of Bitcoin into centralized exchanges (CEXs) for six weeks, totaling almost $2 billion in net deposits. Typically, sustained deposits into exchanges signal sell-offs, raising questions about the entities behind the selling pressure.\n\nAn important insight was the record-high average holding time for transacted Bitcoin, indicating that long-held BTC tokens were circulating. As per the research, it is linked to the outflow of individuals leaving the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nHowever, the analysis also highlighted trends in Bitcoin addresses. Those holding over 1,000 BTC increased their wallets, while those with fewer than 1,000 BTC reduced their holdings in January. Addresses holding Bitcoin for 1-12 months decreased their balances. Long-term holders slightly decreased overall Bitcoin holdings, while short-term holders increased their positions since October 2023.\n\nDespite concerns about the shift from long-term to short-term holders, IntoTheBlock argued that this scenario differs from previous market tops. Factors such as lower volume compared to previous bull markets and a limited decrease in long-term holders\u2019 balances led the platform to suggest that Bitcoin might be facing a temporary setback rather than entering a bearish trend. They anticipate the asset returning to bullish territory.\n\nAfter Short-Term Profit Taking, The Real Challenge\n\nThe other factor adding to the Bitcoin woes is the short-term impact of the spot Bitcoin ETF, which seems to be fading, as indicated by futures and options data. Since traders find the funding rate appealing, suggesting an imminent start of buying activities. Over the last 4 hours, both BTC futures and options open interests (OI) have been on the rise.\n\nThe total BTC futures open interest, covering various exchanges like CME, Binance, and Coinbase, is bouncing back with a 0.35% increase, reaching $18.31 billion. This signals a potential recovery in market interest and activity.\n\nThe ETFs on #Bitcoin have a net inflow of $782 million over the first three days.\n\n\n\nThat's more than 50% higher than ALL ETFs combined have done in 2023 in terms of volume.\n\n\n\nPeople are bearish on #Bitcoin and have a negative outlook.\n\n\n\nDon't be like that. Buy the dip and hold. \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 17, 2024\n\nMichael van de Poppe, a top analyst, says don\u2019t be negative about Bitcoin\u2019s falling price. Instead, he suggests buying when prices drop and holding onto it long-term.\n\n"

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs: The gateway to mainstream crypto adoption - The Economic Times",
        "content": "Agencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approval of 11 Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) marks a significant milestone in the history of crypto . This event signifies a new era of legitimacy and potential growth for Bitcoin, prompting widespread interest from both retail and institutional investors . Let's take a quick look at the top takeaways from this landmark development and explore its implications for the future of Bitcoin.The SEC's decision to approve 11 Bitcoin ETFs is a historic moment, introducing a new asset class to the global financial markets . This move is expected to lower barriers to entry for investors, simplifying access to Bitcoin investments through traditional investment channels.The ETF approval is poised to significantly impact Bitcoin's market value. Analysts like Tom Lee of Fundstrat and Metlem Demirors of Coinshares predict a significant increase in demand, with price targets ranging from a short-term $100,000 to $150,000 and a long-term potential of $500,000 within the next 3 to 5 years.Currently, Bitcoin stands at the 10th position among the world's largest assets. However, this ranking is expected to rise rapidly. Bitcoin is anticipated to soon surpass major assets such as Meta, Silver, and even tech giant Nvidia, reflecting its growing significance in the global asset hierarchy.There's a notable surge in institutional interest and investment in Bitcoin, particularly in derivative markets. The open interest in Bitcoin Futures on the CME Exchange has achieved a new record, reaching an unprecedented high of 36% in relative dominance. This indicates the substantial involvement of institutional investors in the derivatives market, particularly in purchasing Bitcoin Futures. Additionally, there is a notable surge in Bitcoin short positions, reflecting heightened market activity.Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving event in April, where the reward for mining new blocks is halved, is anticipated to further enhance its scarcity, thus potentially driving up its value. This supply shock, combined with a wall of institutional money that is going to come, contributes significantly to Bitcoin's appeal as a long-term investment.Another unique factor is that the percentage of Bitcoin's (BTC) circulating supply that was last active on-chain is about 70% which means that they are HODLing (a term in the crypto community meaning to hold onto the currency long-term). Now, the trend of short-term Bitcoin holders converting to long-term HODLers highlights growing confidence in Bitcoin's future. This shift indicates a belief in the enduring value of Bitcoin, despite its known volatility.Blackrock\u2019s move to cut the fee on its spot ETF to 0.25% makes Bitcoin investments more accessible and cost-effective. This strategic decision is likely to attract a larger group of investors, further embedding Bitcoin in mainstream investment portfolios. Moreover, for the first time, Bitcoin gets serious marketing budgets from these 11 ETFs.The ETF approval has triggered a global ripple effect, with other financial hubs like Hong Kong gearing up to launch additional Bitcoin ETFs. This global adoption speaks volumes about Bitcoin's increasing acceptance and potential for becoming a standard component in investment portfolios worldwide.Financial advisors the world over are beginning to recognise Bitcoin as a viable asset class and will now recommend varying allocations in investment portfolios. This change reflects a shift in the perception of Bitcoin from a speculative instrument to a legitimate investment option.Despite facing volatility and regulatory challenges, Bitcoin continues to show robust growth potential. The mainstream acceptance and institutionalisation of Bitcoin ETFs underscore a bullish outlook for the future of this digital asset.The approval of Bitcoin ETFs is more than just a regulatory development; it\u2019s a paradigm shift in the world of finance. It signifies the merging of traditional investment methods with the innovative world of cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin continues to make strides into mainstream finance, it\u2019s not only reshaping the investment landscape but also challenging the traditional notions of finance and asset management. With institutional backing, reduced barriers to entry, and a growing acceptance among the general public, Bitcoin is poised to play a pivotal role in the future of global finance. This development marks the beginning of a new chapter, not just for Bitcoin but for the entire crypto ecosystem. As we witness this historic moment, one thing is clear: the world of finance is evolving, and Bitcoin is at the forefront of this revolution.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency analyst and trader Kevin Svenson is forecasting the potential path forward for Bitcoin (BTC) over the coming weeks and months.\n\nSvenson tells his 71,300 YouTube subscribers that the S&P 500, an index tracking the stock performance of the largest 500 listed companies in the US, has previously served as a leading indicator for Bitcoin ahead of reaching a new all-time high.\n\n\u201cThe S&P is always leading Bitcoin on the all-time high breaks. And this is a good sign because Bitcoin is still 40% below its all-time high and the S&P is right near its all-time high.\n\nSo if you look back in time, the second halving [2016], the S&P 500 broke its all-time high during the second halving and about seven months later, Bitcoin broke its all-time high. That was about a seven-month difference.\n\nAnd the third halving [2020], the most recent halving, the S&P broke its all-time high and about four months later, Bitcoin broke its all-time high.\u201d\n\nOn what Bitcoin is likely to do as the S&P 500 index hovers just below its all-time high of 4,796 points reached on January 3rd of 2022, Svenson says,\n\n\u201cBitcoin is likely, I would say, less than half a year away, probably about four months away from its all-time high.\n\nSo if the S&P breaks its all-time high, well, we can be pretty sure that Bitcoin is just months away from doing the same thing and then we would be off into this bull market. That is at least what history shows us.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is trading at $41,425 at time of writing.\n\nI\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Kevin Svenson, a prominent cryptocurrency analyst and trader, has made a compelling prediction regarding the potential trajectory of Bitcoin (BTC) in relation to the S&P 500.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s potential surge to a new all-time high\n\nIn his YouTube video entitled \u201cBITCOIN WILL FOLLOW S&P 500 INTO ALL TIME HIGHS,\u201d Svenson discusses the possibility of Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs, drawing parallels to the performance of the S&P 500, stating that the S&P has consistently led Bitcoin in all-time high breaks, and this is promising as Bitcoin is still below 40% it\u2019s all-time high while the S&P is approaching its peak.\n\nThis prediction is based on his analysis of market trends and indicators, suggesting that Bitcoin could experience a significant surge in the coming months, potentially mirroring the record highs of the S&P 500.\n\nAccording to Svenson, the S&P 500\u2019s position serves as a key factor in his projection for Bitcoin\u2019s future performance. He suggests that Bitcoin may be just months away from achieving a new all-time high, aligning with the upward momentum of the S&P 500.\n\nCiting his analysis, there is a possibility of Bitcoin experiencing further upward movement before the next Bitcoin Halving. He also noted a historical pattern where a dip occurred before a bull run preceding the previous Bitcoin Halving events.\n\nHe elaborated that should the S&P 500 surpass its All-Time High, Bitcoin might also follow suit.\n\nIn October, Svenson predicted that Bitcoin\u2019s value could soar to $70,000, contingent upon certain key developments.\n\nAccording to Svenson, his prediction is backed by data-driven insights and pivotal market shifts.\n\nFirst was the crucial resistance level of $32,000, an increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility following the establishment of $32,000 and the now-approved spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund).\n\nHe further emphasized that even if Bitcoin doesn\u2019t immediately breach its all-time high, we should anticipate significant price fluctuations, particularly around the $32,000, from this analysis, the cryptocurrency market could soon witness Bitcoin breaking past the $70,000 threshold.\n\nNotably, Svenson didn\u2019t base his forecast solely on market patterns. He also draws attention to the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund).\n\nYou might also like: Peter Brandt: Bitcoin halving and ETF are much ado about nothing\n\nMore volatility expected\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent years. One of the most significant events that could impact Bitcoin\u2019s price is the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which is scheduled to occur in 2024.\n\nThe halving is a process that occurs every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years.\n\nWhen a halving occurs, the reward for mining a block of Bitcoin is cut in half. This means that fewer new Bitcoins are being created, which can lead to an increase in demand and price.\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin has always pumped after halving. In 2012, the price of Bitcoin increased from around $12 to over $266. In 2016, the price of Bitcoin increased from around $400 to over $1,900. And in 2020, the price of Bitcoin increased from around $7,000 to over $60,000.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $41,617, with a market cap of over $815 billion, according to CoinGecko\n\nRead more: Next Bitcoin halving just 15k blocks away\n\nFollow Us on Google News"

        "content": "Bitcoin: Pet Rock or gold?\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon referred to Bitcoin as a \u201cPet Rock\u201d while speaking in Davos, Switzerland, at a World Economic Forum event earlier this week, Fortune reported.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t remember, Pet Rocks were a brief fad in the \u201870s when many people were moved to fork over four dollars for a ventilated cardboard box containing a rock.\n\nMeanwhile, Oaktree Capital Management founder Howard Marks speaking on Bloomberg\u2019s Merryn Talks Money podcast, compared Bitcoin with gold in that there is a limited supply of both, and they are worth only what others are willing to pay for them. \u201cGold is a little more tried and true, but it also lacks any kind of analytical raison d\u2019etre,\u201d Marks noted, unlike real estate, companies, stocks or bonds, all of which offer returns of some sort.\n\nStill, while Dimon remains a Bitcoin sceptic and said he will speak no more on the subject going forward, he acknowledged seeing utility and promise in smart contracts enabled by blockchain technologies on Ethereum.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nDimon said: \u201cThere\u2019s a cryptocurrency which might actually do something. You can use it to buy and sell real estate and move data, tokenising things that you do something with.\u201d\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF is first to $1bn AUM\n\nBlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, called iShares Bitcoin Trust or IBIT, reached $1 billion in assets under management in about a week of trading, the first among 11 newly launched ETFs to do so, Reuters reported, citing JPMorgan data.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the ETFs tracking the biggest cryptocurrency last week, and BlackRock\u2019s IBIT had accumulated $1.07 billion in assets under management by January 17.\n\nRobert Mitchnick, BlackRock\u2019s head of digital assets, told Fortune that the considerable inflows to IBIT demonstrated strong investor demand.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a long-term commitment focused on providing investors access to an iShares quality ETF.\u201d\n\nHong Kong planning spot crypto EFTs\n\nHong Kong is planning a more flexible approach than the US towards spot crypto ETFs, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s proposed regulations for spot crypto ETFs would allow both cash and in-kind subscriptions. In Hong Kong, dealers will be allowed to use Bitcoin to subscribe to or redeem the ETF\u2019s shares, while in the US, cash must be used, the report said.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 0.23% today at $41,530.80.\n\nEthereum is down 0.82% today at $2,469.63.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading"

        "content": "Roughly a week after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first wave of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), BTC investor demand in the country has slumped.\n\nAccording to a weekly report from market intelligence platform CryptoQuant, the weak BTC demand from U.S. investors is evident in crypto exchange Coinbase\u2019s premium turning negative for the first time in 2024 amid high selling activity from short-term holders.\n\nBTC Investor Demand Slumps\n\nCryptoQuant said the spot Bitcoin ETF approval was a sell-the-news event, as expected. Although the products started trading on January 11 with record volumes, Coinbase saw high over-the-counter transfer volumes running into billions of dollars, and the funds are trading at a premium to spot Bitcoin for the first time since March 2021; BTC has witnessed a downward price pressure.\n\nBTC had lost roughly 15% of its value in days, from $49,000 to $41,500. While the asset currently hovers around $42,800 and downward pressure seems to have eased up, on-chain indicators suggest a tendency for more price corrections.\n\nCurrently, short-term investors and large BTC holders have turned into a \u201crisk-off\u201d attitude and are on a selling spree. This is seen in the Inter-exchange Flow Pulse (IFP) metric falling below its 90-day moving average for the first time since August 2021. Analysts at CryptoQuant say this is a sign that investors\u2019 BTC flow to derivative exchanges has stopped growing, suggesting caution and the tendency for price corrections.\n\nUnrealized Profit Margins Still High\n\nAccording to the report, it appears the Bitcoin market will not hit a price bottom soon as unrealized profit margins have not declined enough for sellers to be exhausted. As such, a new rally is presently not on the cards.\n\nFrom a short-term perspective, BTC has plummeted to more sustainable levels, with short-term holders\u2019 unrealized profit falling from 48% in December 2023 to 16% after the asset\u2019s latest slump. However, the profit margins may need to go below 0% before we can call a price bottom.\n\nMeanwhile, CryptoQuant predicted BTC might eventually plunge to $32,000, the short-term holder realized price, as traders paid too much to open long positions before the ETF approval."

        "content": "Perhaps the most important development in terms of global validation for BTC in its 15-year-long history came last week when the US Securities and Exchange Commission finally greenlighted nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs to be traded on financial markets.\n\nThese approvals were long-anticipated by the crypto community, as well as traditional investors, but they turned out to be a sell-the-news event, after which the price of the underlying asset slumped by 15% in a week or so.\n\nWhy Is That?\n\nVarious experts speculated ahead of the approvals whether they had already been priced in as BTC had soared from around $30,000 to approximately $45,000 in the months leading to them. Those who believed Bitcoin would drop immediately after the ETFs launched on US markets were disappointed at first as the asset flew to over $49,000 last Thursday.\n\nHowever, the situation quickly changed as it dumped by three grand by the end of the US trading day and a further $4,500 on Friday. Since then, BTC has been unable to recover a bigger portion of its losses and currently struggles below $42,000.\n\nAccording to Perplexity \u2013 a popular ChatGPT rival \u2013 one of the reasons behind these declines is profit-taking by investors who had anticipated a run-up ahead of the ETF approvals and decided to cash out a portion of their holdings.\n\nOther possible reasons include \u201cmarket expectations may not have immediately met reality, as some investors may have overestimated the immediate impact of the ETF approvals\u201d and the confusion regarding the ETF\u2019s nature, such as how creation and redemption work.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the increased market volatility following the approvals and the liquidation of leveraged positions could have impacted the price of Bitcoin,\u201d \u2013 Perplexity concluded.\n\nThere\u2019s Some Good News\n\nAlthough analysts were divided in their opinion about the immediate impact on BTC\u2019s price upon the SEC approving the ETFs, most are certain that the long-term effects on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price will be quite positive. Early research shows that over $1 billion has flown into the 11 ETFs in total, meaning that the interest is quite high.\n\nThe popular AI chatbot gave a similar opinion, saying that BTC\u2019s price could indeed reverse its recent trajectory, especially given the upcoming halving, which should take place in April.\n\n\u201cDespite these short-term fluctuations, some analysts and investors still anticipate significant upward movements in Bitcoin\u2019s price over time, driven by the approval of ETFs and other developments in the crypto world.\u201d"

        "content": "Quick Take\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s value teeters slightly over $40,000, the market undergoes significant sell pressure, partly attributable to GBTC outflows and an intriguing profit-taking trend. This trend, which CryptoSlate closely monitors, reveals long-term holders and short-term holders engaging in profit-taking at levels not witnessed in years.\n\nFrom Oct. 20, 2023, onwards, daily profit-taking has become a mainstay, mirroring the pattern seen during the bullish run from Sept. 2020 to Jan. 2021. As Bitcoin\u2019s price escalated, profit-taking followed suit with minimal realized losses.\n\nThe phenomenon continues to escalate. Yesterday, Jan. 18, the market saw a staggering $900 million worth of profit-taking, indicating investors\u2019 tendency to cash in on their earnings. This comes in the wake of Bitcoin\u2019s impressive price climb from $25,000 to $49,000 in Jan. 2024, outlinging the pivotal role of profit-taking in shaping Bitcoin\u2019s price trends."

        "content": "Introduction\n\nOn Jan. 10, 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the trading of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, an event many saw as the opening of floodgates for institutional and retail capital into the Bitcoin market. This approval came after years of anticipation and multiple rejections, highlighting the regulatory hurdles that Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have faced in their journey toward mainstream acceptance\u200b.\n\nIn their first week of trading, these ETFs saw a surge in investor interest, as evidenced by the substantial trading volumes and inflows. CryptoSlate reported that on the first day of trading alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw trading volumes exceeding $4 billion, indicating a strong market appetite for these new financial products. This debut was significant in terms of the sheer volume of trade and in setting a precedent for the type of regulated Bitcoin exposure that investors can now access.\n\nIntroducing these ETFs is not merely a new investment vehicle; it marks a paradigm shift in how Bitcoin is perceived in the financial world. For the first time, investors have the opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated framework, providing a more accessible means to invest in this digital asset. The implications of this shift are far-reaching, extending beyond the crypto market to impact traditional financial markets as well.\n\nIn this report, CryptoSlate will dive deep into the first five days of the ETFs\u2019 trading, analyzing their impact on the market. The report will cover the trading performance of individual ETFs, focusing on significant players like BlackRock and Grayscale and the broader market implications of these new investment tools.\n\nThis report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs is reshaping the investment landscape for Bitcoin and what it means for the future of digital asset trading."

        "content": "6 Shares WhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTwitter\n\nPlus\n\nOn December 10th, the SEC greenlit the trading of 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. The long wait and high anticipation of this approval by cryptocurrency investors prompted a 155% surge in bitcoin prices in 2023, reaching over $42,000. On the inaugural trading day, the new Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a substantial turnover, with $4.6 billion worth of shares exchanged, as reported by investment research firm CFRA.\n\n\"This is a key milestone in the ETF industry,\u201d stated Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFI. \u201cFor a generation of investors who have been embracing ETFs as their go-to investment vehicle, this opens the door for them to get exposure to this emerging asset class.\u201d In other terms, these funds are of a high importance.\n\nAs of January 20, Bitcoin ETFs volume has totaled $16.49 billion. Here's everything you should know about them.\n\nDistinguishing Features of the Latest Bitcoin ETFs\n\nWhile Bitcoin ETFs are not entirely novel, the recent ones bring a different approach. Previous iterations primarily relied on Bitcoin derivatives to mirror its price. These ETFs engaged in buying and selling Bitcoin futures contracts to mimic the cryptocurrency value movements.\n\nHowever, this method often led to imperfect results, with investment returns not precisely mirroring the fluctuations in bitcoin cost. \u201cIt was a broken product that never really worked,\u201d states Stephane Ouellette, founder and CEO of FRNT Financial. \u201cBuying bitcoin products in most retail accounts was very difficult.\u201d\n\nThe latest batch of ETFs resolves this issue, as spot ETFs directly own Bitcoin to track its price. According to Rosenbluth, this approach provides a potentially cleaner means of gaining exposure to the asset.\n\nETFs Boost Cryptocurrency Exposure\n\nETFs provide a convenient means of gaining exposure to cryptocurrencies. Unlike many diversified ETFs that track various investments, these new bitcoin funds focus solely on monitoring the price of Bitcoin. For retail investors, the appeal lies in the ease of purchasing Bitcoin ETFs directly through brokerage accounts, integrating seamlessly with their overall investment portfolio.\n\n\u201cThe investor that\u2019s likely to find this appealing is the one who has already bought other ETFs, whether it\u2019s tied to the S&P 500 or emerging markets or bonds or what have you,\u201d states Rosenbluth. \u201cThis is going to work just like any other ETF of yours. You buy and sell it on the market during trading hours, you get exposure to the underlying investment, and you can sell whatever it is you want in a tax-efficient way.\u201d\n\nOwning an ETF instead of holding Bitcoin directly in a dedicated account come with the drawback of an annual management fee. The expense ratios for the 11 new funds vary from 0.2% to 1.5% of your assets in the fund. However, some firms are currently waiving or reducing their fees to attract customers. Remarkably, Coinbase and other famous crypto exchanges charge traders fees for trading Bitcoin as well as other digital currencies.\n\nInflux of New ETFs in the Horizon\n\nThe initial batch of Bitcoin-backing ETFs is just the starting point, according to Stephane Ouellette. He foresees a potential race to lower fees, turning these ETFs into loss-leading products. Within the next year, major fund companies are expected to expand their crypto product offerings, exploring funds that blend Bitcoin holdings with diverse assets or incorporate trading strategies using derivatives to capitalize on specific market trends.\n\nCurrently, choosing a bitcoin ETF for your portfolio is a matter of personal preference aligned with your risk tolerance. Rosenbluth notes that opting for a fund waiving fees might offer the best cost advantage, while selecting a reputable name could instill a sense of trust in your investment choice.\n\nAs more intricate funds enter the scene, you'll need to conduct a bit more research to ascertain if a particular product aligns with your investment objectives.\n\nThe Ripple Effect of ETF Approval on the Global Crypto Confidence\n\nPositive growth in the U.S. crypto space often have a domino effect on the worldwide market sentiment. Edul Patel, CEO & Co-founder of Mudrex, emphasizes that \"the SEC's approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs will attract institutional investors who were previously cautious due to regulatory concerns. There will be increased institutional interest, which could further lead to higher liquidity and more stability in the market, which may have a global impact, including in India.\"\n\nWhile the immediate impact may be noticeable in the Bitcoin market, the endorsement of crypto investment through regulated spot ETFs carries wider significance. Edul Patel suggests that this move has the potential to attract a large investor base, fostering increased capital flows throughout various cryptocurrencies. Key industry players, including BlackRock, have already submitted filing for Ethereum spot ETFs, generating anticipation for potential approvals in this domain.\n\nLooking forward, the convergence of ETF approvals, the upcoming halving and regulatory clarity establishes a promising outlook for Bitcoin. Patel anticipates, \"the year 2024 holds immense promise for Bitcoin, as the confluence of ETFs, halving, and regulatory clarity is set to drive demand. It is expected that BTC will cross its previous highs of 69k.\" This expectation extends beyond short-term gains; Patel foresees a substantial influx of 5-7 billion in the next three months, with institutions showing a keen interest in the crypto market."

        "content": "Despite positive developments such as the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Bitcoin\u2019s price encountered significant rejection, resulting in a notable 17% decline.\n\nHowever, as the cryptocurrency approaches a crucial support region, there is potential for a renewed bullish movement.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nThe Daily Chart\n\nAnalyzing the daily chart, Bitcoin\u2019s attempt to overcome the substantial resistance at $48K was met with rejection, leading to a 17% decline towards a critical support region. It includes the middle boundary of the ascending channel and the pivotal 200-day moving average at $39K, serving as robust support for Bitcoin buyers.\n\nIf the retracement persists, the price is anticipated to find support around $39K, possibly triggering a renewed bullish surge. However, an unexpected break below the 200-day moving average could lead to a cascade, flushing out a notable amount of sell-stop orders, resulting in a long-squeeze event.\n\nThe 4-Hour Chart\n\nOn the 4-hour chart, the rejection from the $48K resistance zone extended, with the price breaking below the lower boundary of the ascending flag, indicating the presence of sellers. However, after a strong breakout, a retracement towards the flag\u2019s lower boundary is underway, potentially completing a pullback. If it happens, the retrace could pave the way for the continuation of Bitcoin\u2019s downward movement in the short term, targeting the static support range of $39K.\n\nNevertheless, Bitcoin\u2019s mid-term prospects suggest consolidation within the critical price range bounded by the substantial resistance zone at $48K and the decisive support at $39K. Nonetheless, a successful breakout from this zone will shed light on the cryptocurrency\u2019s next impulsive trend.\n\nOn-chain Analysis\n\nBy Shayan\n\nAs Bitcoin faces a notable price rejection, there is a growing concern among market participants about the sustainability of the current uptrend. Valuable insight can be gained by analyzing the sentiment in the futures market.\n\nThe following chart illustrates the Bitcoin funding rates \u2013 a key indicator in futures market sentiment analysis. It helps gauge whether buyers or sellers are executing their orders more aggressively.\n\nDespite the recent short-term correction, the funding rates have experienced a significant decline. However, it\u2019s noteworthy that the metric still shows positive values. This can be interpreted as a positive sign, suggesting that the sentiment remains bullish while the futures market has cooled off from being overheated.\n\nAs a result, there is a possibility that the price might continue its upward trajectory after completing the current correction stage."

Bitcoin wallet addresses holding over 1,000 BTC climbed to 1,510, highest level since August 2022.\n\nBTC price is $41,707, at the time of writing.\n\nAlso read: SEC v. Binance lawsuit: Federal Judge calls for court review of whether digital assets are securities\n\nBitcoin sees uptick in whales\n\nAccording to data from Glassnode, the number of addresses holding over 1,000 BTC has hit its highest level since August 2022. The total has reached 1,510. An increase in the number of large wallet addresses either signals a rise in traders\u2019 confidence on Bitcoin or whales are likely positioning themselves for a shift in BTC price trend.\n\nBitcoin: Number of Entities with Balance greater than 1,000 BTC. Source: Glassnode\n\nBitcoin traders recently realized $885 million in profit on BTC acquired between three and six months ago, at an average price of $26,000, according to Glassnode data. Traders netted a profit above 57%. If the profit-taking streaks of BTC traders continues, it is likely that whales take profits on their BTC holdings, increasing the selling pressure on the asset.\n\nAccording to CryptoQuant data, Bitcoin is in the distribution phase and the asset is not distrbited to retailers fully. A short-term correction in BTC price is likely, according to CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju. The expert believes Bitcoin is currently in a long-term bull market cycle until there is a complete distribution of the asset."

        "title": "Bitcoin's spot ETFs make a splash, but can their AUM surpass gold ETFs? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The surge of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has become a focal point in financial markets, fueling speculation about their potential to outshine traditional assets like gold. ETFs are conveniently bought and sold on regular stock exchanges, simplifying the process for everyday investors to trade Bitcoin using their standard brokerage accounts.\n\nAnother benefit is that these instruments are subject to regulatory oversight, breaking down barriers for mutual funds and professional finance managers who were previously unable to hold and manage digital assets directly.\n\nImpact of spot ETF Bitcoin on the underlying spot market\n\nETFs have a unique way of maintaining their prices in line with the value of the assets they represent, involving a process called creation and redemption. This process plays a crucial role in managing the number of ETF shares available in the market and ensuring that the ETF price stays closely tied to the value of the assets it represents.\n\nSimilar to the prices of other items that can be bought and sold, the price of an ETF is influenced by how much people want to buy it (demand) and how much people want to sell it (supply). Sometimes, the demand for an ETF can be very high or very low, causing its price to move away from the actual value of the assets it holds.\n\nTo prevent significant differences between the ETF price and the value of its assets, there are special players in the financial world called authorized participants. These participants can create or redeem ETF shares based on market demand. Creating new shares increases the supply, and redeeming shares decreases it. By doing this, they can help keep the ETF price in check and avoid significant deviations from the true value of the assets it represents.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs surpass expectations in volumes\n\nTrading for spot Bitcoin ETFs began on Jan. 11, and these products amassed a record-high $14 billion in volume in the first five days, a feat unmatched by other commodity ETFs.\n\nAnother way to put the bitcoin ETF flows in ETF context (besides showing their #s relative to past new launches) is how they stack up to ALL ETFs in past 1 week flows. Even after four days two of them are in Top 5 and three in Top 10, up there w the studs $VOO, $QQQ et al. pic.twitter.com/oduhktEqwG \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 18, 2024\n\nAs highlighted by Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg\u2019s senior ETF analyst, the only asset class that outshone Bitcoin in terms of volumes was the one tracking either the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq 100 indexes. To put things in perspective, the United States stock market capitalization stands at $52 trillion, more than 60 times larger than Bitcoin\u2019s $810 billion.\n\nMore importantly, the combined assets under management (AUM) of Bitcoin\u2019s spot ETF issuers stands at $2.8 billion, surpassing the sum of silver, crude oil and broad diversified commodities \u2014 leaving gold as the only remaining competitor.\n\nA post on X (formerly Twitter) by James Van Straten, lead analyst at CryptoSlate, depicts the precious metal gold as the absolute leader in the commodities segment, holding $96 billion worth under its ETF instruments.\n\nAs the SEC has recognized #Bitcoin as a commodity by this latest filing, see the link below.\n\n\n\n.@akibablade, and I did some digging.\n\n\n\nIn terms of AUM for all commodity ETFs, #Bitcoin would rank 2nd, with a combined value of $28 billion, with 10 ETFs, behind Gold.\n\n\n\nAs of now,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/2RZbLTPz1I \u2014 James Van Straten (@jvs_btc) January 18, 2024\n\nHowever, the AUM of Bitcoin ETFs currently represents only 3.5% of Bitcoin\u2019s current market capitalization. In contrast, even if one excludes the 63% of gold\u2019s AUM used in jewelry, coins, electronics and other applications, its ETF industry encompasses merely 2% of gold\u2019s remaining $5 trillion market capitalization.\n\nGold is not the only direct competitor in the ETF industry\n\nWhile the growth of Bitcoin ETFs has outpaced that of commodities-based ETFs, the bond market tells a different story, amassing an impressive $2 trillion in AUM globally. Similarly, the S&P 500 ETF industry\u2019s AUM surpasses $1 trillion, underscoring the enduring appeal of traditional equities.\n\nRelated: Impact of Bitcoin ETFs: \u2018Revolutionary change\u2019 or colossal \u2018dud\u2019?\n\nWhile Bitcoin ETFs haven\u2019t surpassed gold\u2019s market cap, the recent growth signals a compelling narrative. The comparison with commodities like oil, silver, and gold underscores Bitcoin\u2019s growing influence as a legitimate asset class.\n\nAs Bitcoin matures, the potential for a market cap above $1 trillion becomes increasingly plausible, affirming its position as a transformative force in the financial realm.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "\ufeff\ufeff Bitcoin overtakes Silver, Solana will launch its second smartphone and Elon Musk reveals his personal crypto holdings. These stories and more, this week in crypto.\n\nBitcoin Slips After ETF Approval\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has plunged by more than 15% since the introduction of U.S. spot ETFs last week. Analysts reported one and a half billion dollars in outflows from the Grayscale Trust, speculating that investors who were previously benefiting from GBTC discounts, are now exiting the bitcoin market entirely rather than reinvesting into the new ETFs. With estimates of another $1.5 billion invested in GBTC in secondary markets, additional profit-taking may put further pressure on bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin Tops Silver\n\nFollowing SEC approval, the Bitcoin ETFs now hold nearly $30 billion in assets, far outpacing silver ETFs which have combined assets of about $11 billion. While Bitcoin is often called a digital version of gold, the only commodity that remains more popular is, well\u2026 gold \u2013 with roughly $95 billion in funds spread across 19 ETFs.\n\nBlackRock Scooped Up Most Bitcoins\n\nWith investors piling into the new spot Bitcoin funds, CC15Capital reports that as of Friday, the nine new ETFs have purchased nearly 81,000 Bitcoins, currently worth nearly $3.5 billion, since their launch. BlackRock leads the way, amassing over 28,000 BTC for its iShares fund. Even after liquidating more than 50,000 bitcoins to cover the outflows mentioned earlier, Grayscale continues to manage the most Bitcoin among ETFs with its substantial holdings of 567,000 BTC.\n\nNew Crypto Smartphone by Solana\n\nSolana plans to launch its second crypto smartphone, as a follow up to its first phone, Saga. The new phone will have new hardware and a cheaper price point, and aims to calm the secondary market for the limited supply of existing Saga phones. Initially struggling to find a market, Saga gained traction when traders discovered it included BONK tokens, after which the phones quickly sold out in a week.\n\nJamie Dimon Dismisses Bitcoin in Davos\n\nArtificial intelligence has stolen the spotlight at Davos, supplanting cryptos as the dominant topic of conversation at the World Economic Forum. This shift underscores the surge in AI investments as the world\u2019s biggest companies are pushing their AI products and services. On the forum, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon grabbed the opportunity to dismiss Bitcoin yet again, acknowledging blockchain\u2019s potential while emphasizing that Bitcoin does nothing.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s Court Battle Resumes\n\nIn a case closely watched by the crypto industry, a Manhattan judge questioned Coinbase and the SEC about their conflicting definitions of securities. Judge Katherine Polk Failla heard arguments from both sides focusing on legal precedent defining securities. Coinbase has requested the dismissal of the lawsuit brought by the SEC.\n\nCrypto Crime Declines\n\nAccording to new research illicit cryptocurrency activity is declining overall despite a surge in ransomware incidents and cybercriminals receiving crypto payments. Chainalysis released its 2024 Crypto Crime Trends report which highlighted a decrease in funds sent to illicit cryptocurrency addresses, while noting an uptick in funds sent to sanctioned entities using stablecoins.\n\nMusk Reveals Personal Crypto Holdings\n\nElon Musk has revealed his personal crypto holdings, as his social media platform X has received another money-transmitter license, with the aim to revolutionize payments. Musk confirmed he still owns Dogecoin, revealed that SpaceX continues to hold Bitcoin and Tesla also has just over 10,000 bitcoin worth nearly $500 million.\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s happened this week in crypto, see you next week."

        "content": "Hong Kong is set to develop a more flexible regime for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), even though the US leads in both approval speed and market size, experts said.\n\nA key difference between Hong Kong\u2019s proposed rules for spot cryptocurrency ETFs and products approved in the US is that Hong Kong will allow both cash and in-kind subscriptions. Under such rules, participating dealers can directly use bitcoin to subscribe to or redeem the ETF\u2019s shares, whereas in the US, such subscriptions and redemptions are only allowed with cash.\n\nThe different approach reflects a divergence of virtual asset regulatory frameworks, where the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \u201cappears reluctant to allow licensed dealers to touch bitcoin\u201d when subscribing for and redeeming ETF shares because spot bitcoin trades are unregulated in the US, according to Andrew Fei, a partner at King & Wood Mallesons in Hong Kong.\n\nRegulators in Hong Kong last month said that they will allow retail access to spot virtual asset ETFs, and are willing to accept applications from funds hoping to offer such products to the public."

Meanwhile, crypto analyst Crypto Tony has sent shock waves through the community with a tweet predicting a potential price dip to $38,000 for BTC in the lead-up to the halving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n$BTC / $USD - Update\n\n\n\nMid range at the moment, but $38,000 i expect as we grind towards the halving in April legends pic.twitter.com/n3t3a33kXW \u2014 Crypto Tony (@CryptoTony__) January 21, 2024\n\nAs of the latest update, the current price of Bitcoin stands at $41,770, experiencing a modest 0.62% increase in the last 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency has witnessed a 5.01% dip over the past 30 days, reflecting the ongoing fluctuations in the market. The trading volume for Bitcoin has also seen a significant decrease, plummeting by 56.12% in the last 24 hours to reach $9,930,593,235.\n\nNotably, CoinGlass data indicates that in the past 24 hours alone, there has been $2.54 million worth of liquidations in BTC. This includes $628.48K in long liquidations and $1.91 million in short liquidations, underlining the current market's sensitivity to fluctuations. Crypto enthusiasts and investors are closely monitoring these developments as the countdown to the Bitcoin halving continues.\n\nBitcoin halving buzz\n\nAs previously reported by U.Today, Glassnode, a prominent on-chain analytics platform, estimates that the Bitcoin halving is approximately 97 days away. Bitcoin halving is a predetermined event that occurs roughly every four years or after 210,000 blocks have been mined. During this process, the reward that miners receive for validating transactions is halved.\n\nThis scarcity mechanism is ingrained in Bitcoin's protocol, intended to control the coin's inflation and maintain its value over time. This impending event is considered a significant catalyst for the Bitcoin price, drawing from historical price patterns where previous halving events have coincided with substantial price surges."

She has 10+year experience in writing - accordingly she is avid journalists with a passion towards researching new insights coming into crypto erena.\n\nIn a recent video, prominent crypto analyst and YouTuber Kevin Stevenson shared insights on Bitcoin\u2019s current price action and his optimistic forecast for a new all-time high in the coming months.\n\nStevenson\u2019s Predictions\n\nStevenson talked about the recent sideways movement in Bitcoin\u2019s price but emphasized that the lack of lower lows since December is a positive sign. He discussed the potential for a pullback to test oversold levels on the daily chart and why he remains unfazed by the recent downturn.\n\nStevenson highlighted the correlation with the S&P 500 and pointed out that the stock market is nearing its all-time high. He suggested that historical patterns indicate a strong likelihood that Bitcoin will follow suit just months after the S&P 500 breaks its record. Stevenson recalled instances from the second and third Bitcoin halvings, where the S&P 500\u2019s all-time high preceded Bitcoin\u2019s surge.\n\nAddressing the bearish scenario, Stevenson indicated a potential dip below the critical level of $40,200, which could lead to a retest of oversold levels, with a target around $35,000. However, he also expressed confidence in a quick comeback, referencing positive fundamental events, including ETF approvals and the upcoming halving.\n\nBitcoin ATH and S&P500 ATH\n\nStevenson states that any dips before halving, especially during pre-halving, are usually \u201cgenerational buy opportunities.\u201d He advises viewers to notice any potential dip as a buying opportunity, especially considering the historical significance of price levels before each Bitcoin halving.\n\nStevenson\u2019s analysis also focused on the synchronicity between the S&P 500 and Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. Notably, he pointed out that historically, when the S&P 500 reached its all-time high, Bitcoin followed and reached its all-time high within a few months.\n\nDrawing parallels to the second and third Bitcoin halvings, Stevenson pointed out Bitcoin\u2019s 2nd-halving and the most recent 3rd-having, where the S&P 500\u2019s milestone preceded Bitcoin\u2019s ATH.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs Bitcoin hovers above $40,000, Stevenson\u2019s analysis provides a cautious and optimistic approach, correlating Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory with the upcoming S&P 500s nearing their all-time high."

        "title": "How Big Can Bitcoin Get? - The Irrelevant Investor",
        "content": "There was more speculation leading up to the launch of the Bitcoin ETF than anything that I\u2019ve ever seen. People were debating how much money these ETFs would take in and what impact the inflows would have on the underlying price.\n\nThe nine new spot Bitcoin ETFs that came to market have collectively taken in just under $4 billion. (H/t Eric Balchunas on all this data)\n\nIBIT (iShares) and FBTC (Fidelity) took 4 and 5 days respectively to get to $1 billion in assets. The only other ETFs to get there faster were BITO, the BTC futures ETF, which took 2 days, and GLD, which took 3 days.\n\nThe volume that these things are doing is arguably more impressive than the assets. Balchunas notes that:\n\n\u201cFor context, as a group the Nine\u2019s $1.2b in daily volume puts them in Top 1% of all ETFs (w/ $GBTC as well). But even if you single them out, $FBTC & $IBIT each in Top 2%. Keep in mind the avg age of ETFs in Top 2% is prob like 14yrs old. So pretty wild to get there in a week.\u201d\n\nSo the launch of these ETFs was a resounding success. Hard stop. The price of the underlying is more of a mixed bag.\n\nThe ETFs are down ~10% since they started trading. But Bitcoin itself is up almost 40% over the last three months as anticipation of the launch grew stronger. It shouldn\u2019t be terribly surprising that it didn\u2019t go up in a straight line after the announcement of something that had been well-telegraphed. The market, every market, is pretty good about pricing stuff in. This is not to say I called this, I didn\u2019t, but I\u2019m not surprised either. Pretty normal stuff.\n\nI view crypto today as more of an asset class and less of a game-changing technological innovation. I\u2019m open-minded to the fact that this statement may look dumb in the future. Happy to change my mind if I\u2019m proven wrong. So as an asset class, how big can this thing get?\n\nBefore we try and answer that question, which is anybody\u2019s guess, let\u2019s look at Bitcoin\u2019s journey to $800 billion.\n\nSince Bitcoin\u2019s market cap first crossed $1 million, it has compounded at an eye-watering 178% annual return. Sober people should expect this to come down dramatically. For should this continue for another three years, it will have a market cap of $40 trillion, the same as the S&P 500 today. If we assume the S&P grows at 8% a year, then it would take Bitcoin 10 years to pass it with the same assumed growth rate.\n\nThe easiest analog for Bitcoin is digital gold. Hardly an original take, but reasonable nonetheless. Gold has a current market cap of ~13.5 trillion. My guess is it doesn\u2019t get there unless the broader crypto environment makes serious progress on the techno use case.\n\nBitcoin is the most polarizing instrument I\u2019ve ever seen. People either love it or hate it. There\u2019s rarely a middle ground. There will always be people who scream that it doesn\u2019t have a use case, despite how high its price goes, and there will always be people who think that everything should be priced in Bitcoin, including your home.\n\nI don\u2019t have a strong take on how big Bitcoin can be, but I do think it goes higher from here (full disclosure, I\u2019ve owned it since June 2020). Not in a straight line, obviously, but if you view it as a commodity, which I do, then I simply think demand will exceed supply for the foreseeable future. No need to make it any more complicated than that."

Stakeholders are now speculating on the halving\u2019s potential impact on BTC\u2018s value and the broader market dynamics.\n\nBTC Searches Seen Soaring Post-ETF Approval\n\nIn the year leading up to the week of January 15 to 21 2023, Google Trends data shows a rise in the popularity of the search term \u201cBitcoin.\u201d According to Google Trends, which rates search interest from 1 to 100, the term had a score of 55 during that period.\n\nThis system is based on the ratio of searches for a specific term to the total volume of searches in a certain time frame and location. A score of 100 represents the highest level of popularity for the term. By the end of March 2023, the score for \u201cBitcoin\u201d had increased to 65, reflecting a growing curiosity about and engagement with the cryptocurrency.\n\nBTC Search Popularity Skyrockets in Early 2024 After a Muted 2023\n\nThroughout much of 2023, public interest in the term \u201cBitcoin\u201d as measured by Google Trends remained relatively subdued. The lowest point came in the week of October 8th to 14th, with a search interest score of just 35 out of a possible 100. However, following this lull, there was a noticeable uptick in curiosity about Bitcoin, leading to a score of 61 by the end of October.\n\nThe peak of interest in 2023 occurred in the week of December 3rd to 9th, with the term \u201cBitcoin\u201d scoring a notable 70 out of 100. Yet, it wasn\u2019t until the second week of January 2024 that the search term for Bitcoin reached an unprecedented level of popularity, achieving a perfect score of 100.\n\nA 90-Day Google Trends Analysis\n\nA 90-day analysis by Google Trends highlights significant changes in the global search popularity of \u201cBitcoin.\u201d On January 11, 2024, the term achieved a peak interest score of 100. However, by January 15, this score had dropped sharply to 41. This pattern reflects the initial excitement around the spot Bitcoin ETFs and the subsequent decline in fervor as the buzz around these financial products began to fade.\n\nAs of the third week of January 2024, El Salvador, where BTC is legal tender, leads the world in searches for \u201cBitcoin\u201d. Meanwhile, Nigeria, Switzerland, Austria, and the Netherlands are also showing strong interest.\n\nThe topics and queries related to \u201cBitcoin\u201d during this period are predominantly centered around ETFs. \u201cExchange-traded fund\u201d has emerged as a popular related term, along with significant interest in the \u201cU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\u201d Other notable topics include cryptocurrencies like \u201cSolana\u201d and \u201cTether,\u201d as well \u201cBitcoin Dominance.\u201d\n\nGoogle Trends recorded a peak score of 55 out of 100 for \"bitcoin\" during Jan.\n\n7-13, 2024. Interest surged on Jan. 11 after the SEC approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. Research attention is now on Bitcoin's upcoming reward halving.#Bitcoin #BTC #GoogleTrends #CryptoNews \u2014 Crypto Multistream (@CryptoMStream) January 17, 2024\n\nCommon search queries include terms such as \u201cBitcoin ETF approval,\u201d \u201cBitcoin ETFs,\u201d \u201cBitcoin ETF news,\u201d \u201cBitcoin ETF approved,\u201d and \u201cETF Bitcoin.\u201d Additionally, trending topics linked to \u201cBitcoin\u201d are also focused on financial entities like \u201cBlackrock\u201d and market-related terms such as \u201cBitcoin price.\u201d This suggests a heightened interest in the investment and market aspects of Bitcoin following recent developments in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nDecline in Interest for BTC Halving Post-ETF Approval As Bitcoin approaches its next major event, the reward halving anticipated in April 2024, Google Trends data showcases a notable spike in interest for the specific query \u201cBitcoin halving.\u201d This term, reflecting focused attention on the upcoming halving milestone, reached its highest popularity with a score of 100 on January 11, 2024, coinciding with the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. However, the intense interest observed immediately following the ETF approvals has since witnessed a significant decline. The countries showing the most significant interest in the \u201cBitcoin halving\u201d term were Slovenia, Cyprus, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Austria. Despite this initial surge in queries, by January 15, 2024, search interest for \u201cBitcoin halving\u201d had fallen to 49. Bitcoin sells off after ETF approval, losing support at $45K and $43K. Price falls below $42K amid Binance ban in India. Keep an eye on $40K level for potential bearish turn. #Bitcoin #ETF #Binance #India \" \u2014 Flavius Co. \ud83e\uddcc\u221eS (@flama_co) January 13, 2024 This fluctuation in search interest underscores the short-term nature of public attention, particularly in the often volatile cryptosphere. While the ETF approvals initially heightened curiosity about Bitcoin\u2019s future, this appears to have fallen as the immediate buzz subsided. Bitcoin\u2019s Influence in FinTech Amid Fluctuating Public Interest The recent surge in search popularity for Bitcoin highlights the cryptocurrency\u2019s expanding influence. This spike in interest is a testament to Bitcoin\u2019s increasingly prominent role in mainstream economic discourse. This attention reflects not just the speculative allure of Bitcoin but also its integration in the future of finance. Bitcoin is going to $500k after the\n\nSpot ETF is approval. Here is the\n\nevidence \u2013 When Gold ETF was approved, it\u2019s\n\nmcap was around $2 Trillion.

The asset\u2019s inherent qualities of being censorship-resistant and decentralized play a significant role in its attractiveness. These features, coupled with its potential as a hedge against traditional financial systems, contribute to its sustained interest. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, only time will unveil the enduring impact and appeal of Bitcoin. Its ability to adapt to changing market dynamics, regulation, and technological changes will be crucial in determining its long-term position in the financial ecosystem."

While many expected sustained price growth post-ETF approval, the opposite has happened.\n\n1/ Bitcoin prices decreased about 10% in the past week, and even more since the approval of the Bitcoin ETF. Many expected the opposite. So let\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s going on with $BTC \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/q61CnAhuiO \u2014 IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 19, 2024\n\nAfter BTC\u2019s price peaked at $48,625 on 11th January, its value has since plummeted. The coin traded at $41,548 at press time, according to CoinMarketCap data. This marked a 15% decline in value in the last nine days.\n\nThe decline in BTC\u2019s value in the past week has been partly due to a rise in its inflows into centralized exchanges. When an asset sees a spike in exchange inflows, it suggests that selling momentum is high.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock, in the last week, BTC recorded its sixth consecutive week of inflows into exchanges. Since December, BTC\u2019s net deposits into exchanges have been nearly $2 billion.\n\nAssessing which cohort of BTC investors have sold their holdings the most in the last week, IntoTheBlock considered the average holding time of transacted BTC coins.\n\nThis metric, which reached an all-time high on 15th January and the second-highest weekly average, suggested that older coins, presumably held for longer periods, have entered into circulation.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock, this movement \u201ccould be the result of people exiting GBTC,\u201d probably due to the lean premium on the trust.\n\nLong-term holders take a step back\n\nHowever, despite the double-digit price fall in the past week, BTC whales have continued to accumulate the king coin.\n\nBTC wallet addresses with a balance exceeding 1000 BTCs \u201chave added to their wallets and those with fewer than 1k $BTC decreased their holdings in January,\u201d IntoTheBlock added.\n\nAs the coin trades below $42,000, its short-term holders (those who held the coins for less than 12 months) have gradually reduced their holdings.\n\nInterestingly, due to the coin\u2019s reaction post-ETF approval, BTC long-term holders \u201chaven\u2019t been buying as strongly as they\u2019ve done in the past months,\u201d IntoTheBlock found.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-25\n\nIn the last month, the supply of BTC held by this group of investors has dropped by -0.38%.\n\nCommenting on the significance of this, IntoTheBlock said the minor decline in long-term holdings and an MVRV ratio of 1.88 suggests that the king coin may be experiencing a \u201ctemporary setback\u201d and is yet to commence the real bull cycle."

I believe it\u2019s an asset class. \u2014 Larry Fink, BlackRock\n\nBut the cryptocurrency has failed to gain much traction as a payments system because it is expensive and cumbersome to use, a defect conceded by even its most influential supporters, such as Larry Fink, the US billionaire who runs BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a believer in it because I do believe it is an alternative source for wealth holding,\u201d he said in an interview earlier this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s ever going to be a currency. I believe it\u2019s an asset class.\u201d\n\nBut if bitcoin has no practical utility, what does that mean for its price?\n\n\u201cI believe it goes up if the world is more frightened, if people are fearful of geopolitical risk, or fearful of their own risk,\u201d Fink said. \u201cIt\u2019s no different to what gold represented over thousands of years.\n\n\u201cIt is an asset class that protects you. But unlike gold, where we manufacture new gold, we\u2019re almost at the ceiling of the amount of bitcoin that can be created.\u201d\n\nHowever, Fink predicted the blockchain technology that underpins bitcoin would eventually revolutionise finance.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to create digital currencies. We\u2019re going to use the technology for it. We\u2019re going to use the blockchain,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cETFs are step one in the technological revolution in the financial markets. Step two is going to be the tokenisation of every financial asset.\u201d\n\nBlackRock\u2019s application for a bitcoin ETF last June \u2013 when it was trading around the $US25,000 level \u2013 helped spur a huge rally in the digital currency\u2019s price as investors began to hope that the support of the giant asset manager would help allay regulators\u2019 concerns.\n\nThe crypto industry has been pushing for bitcoin ETFs for years, arguing that they would reduce transaction costs, opening the sector to more investors.\n\nInclusion in portfolios\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts say the ETFs will clear the way for the digital currency to be included in the $US100 trillion ($151.5 trillion) in investment portfolios managed by big institutions, such as banks and super funds.\n\nEven if a tiny fraction of these funds were allocated to bitcoin, it could lead to a substantial increase in the digital currency\u2019s price, given that bitcoin\u2019s total market value is about $US820 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the first few days of trading last week, spot bitcoin ETFs attracted about $US2 billion; the BlackRock ETF hit the $US1 billion mark in one week.\n\nAll the same, it is likely to take years for big institutional investors, and financial advisers, to embrace cryptocurrencies \u2013 if at all they do.\n\nAs a relatively new asset class, cryptocurrency ETFs will have to undergo rigorous due diligence and compliance reviews before big financial firms allow their advisers to recommend the products to clients.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, although some of Wall Street\u2019s initial scepticism of cryptocurrency has waned, pockets of hostility remain.\n\nEven the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, made it clear that it gave its approval reluctantly.\n\nGary Gensler, the SEC chairman, said that although the regulator had approved several spot bitcoin ETFs, \u201cwe did not approve or endorse bitcoin\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestors, he added, \u201cshould remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, index fund giant Vanguard has also indicated that it won\u2019t be offering spot bitcoin ETFs, saying they don\u2019t align with its traditional offerings of shares, bonds and cash, \u201cwhich Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio\u201d.\n\n\u2018More like roulette\u2019\n\nAnd a senior Goldman Sachs executive has warned that digital currencies are still more like roulette, rather than an asset that should be held in a retirement savings account.\n\n\u201cIf you want to go to Las Vegas, great,\u201d Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, who leads the investment strategy group at Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management, told The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cPeople can use it if they want for total speculation, but it is not an investment and people should not be investing in cryptocurrencies, in bitcoin, in the ETF, as part of an investment portfolio.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto critics say bitcoin\u2019s tendency for wilder price swings than other assets makes it an unsuitable financial product to hold wealth.\n\nFor instance, as financial markets panicked in the early stages of the global coronavirus pandemic, the price of bitcoin more than halved from its February 2020 high to its low a month later. During that time, the US blue-chip S & P 500 shed a third of its value, and gold fell 6 per cent.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the critics fear bitcoin ETFs will only exacerbate its price volatility by attracting more money and making it easier and cheaper for speculators to buy and sell the digital currency.\n\nEven some early crypto believers who were drawn to Nakamoto\u2019s vision of a payments system independent of governments, central banks and mainstream banks are unhappy at Wall Street\u2019s adoption of the digital currency.\n\nThey say the big financial institutions are corrupting the original vision that allowed individuals to escape from the power of the state, and have instead turned the digital currency into a speculative plaything.\n\nAnd they\u2019re none too pleased that the new bitcoin ETFs will be heavily dependent on Wall Street banks and electronic-trading giants to act as \u201cauthorised participants\u201d, which help to make sure the quantity of shares expands and contracts in line with investor demand."

Net fund inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs stood at $33.1 million at the close of the sixth trading day, according to data compiled by BitMEX Research.\n\nFinancial services giant Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC) accounted for the lion\u2019s share of inflows at $222.3 million. It was followed by BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF, which drew investments worth $201.5 million.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, investors poured 63.4 million into Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), $62.6 million into Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), $56.7 million into Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), $14.2 million into VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL), and $2.9 million into WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW).\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Spot Bitcoin ETF Sees Outflows of $590M on Day 6\n\nWhile other funds made gains, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) continued to see sizeable outflows, with more than $590 million in assets flowing out of GBTC on the sixth day of trading. Investors have been exiting GBTC partly because Grayscale levies a higher fee on its Bitcoin ETF as compared to rivals.\n\nThe fund outflows can also be attributed to profit-taking on Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, with some investors looking to exploit the fund\u2019s discount to net asset value. Assets worth over $2 billion have exited GBTC since it was converted into a Bitcoin ETF last week, CoinGape News reported earlier.\n\nOn the other hand, nine spot Bitcoin ETFs, minus Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, have cumulatively purchased $79,618 Bitcoin (BTC) since their launch, valued at over $3.2 billion, as per data provided by CCCapital15\u2019s X handle.\n\nETF Issuers Suck Up 796 Bitcoin On Day 6\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF issuers scooped up another net 796.6 Bitcoin on their sixth trading day, data from X (formerly Twitter) account BitMEX Research showed. This implies that a net $33 million worth of Bitcoin was added to their holdings.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that spot Bitcoin ETFs run by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise were among the top 10 most-traded ETFs in the US over the past week. Furthermore, the asset size of Grayscale and Fidelity\u2019s Bitcoin ETFs had crossed $1 billion after just five days of trading.\n\nWhile the broader impact of Bitcoin ETFs on the crypto market remains to be seen, it is already being heralded as a game-changer by many crypto pundits, with Bitcoin advocate and author Vijay Boyapati saying ETFs would boost retail investment into Bitcoin.\n\nAlso Read: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Excluding GBTC Have Bought BTC Worth $2.8 Billion Since Launch"

        "content": "In the current financial climate, experts have noted that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to maintain steady interest rates. The meeting is scheduled for January 30 and 31.\n\nThe Fed is reportedly maintaining the status quo due to recent economic data that has been better than expected. Bloomberg analysts note that the focus is now shifting to the FOMC\u2019s March meeting and beyond, with expectations that any policy easing might commence only after that.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAmid this, Wall Street closed the week positively, with the S&P 500 touching a record high on Friday. This surge, particularly evident in technology companies, has propelled the main US equity benchmark to surpass its previous peak from January 2022, as noted by the Financial Times.\n\nTech correlation: a sloppy indicator\n\nIn contrast to the surging stock market, Bitcoin\u2019s performance remains moderate. The king coin is currently priced under $42,000. It has a trading volume of $7.267 billion over 24 hours, based on CoinGecko data. This lukewarm response in the cryptocurrency market comes on the sidelines of some equity market optimism. However, the keyword here is \u2018some\u2019 considering few analysts believe this is just an early optimism before the release of quarterly results. However, there is an expectation that the market will remain upbeat.\n\nKevin Davitt, the head of options content at Nasdaq, pointed out that Bitcoin and the NDX have a fairly high correlation of 0.805. However, he mentioned that there are times when this correlation weakens, which could present investment opportunities in Bitcoin and other funds. Therefore, the stock market alone isn\u2019t an indicator of Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory.\n\nBitcoin price action subdued\n\nPantera Capital recently noted in an analysis that cryptocurrency bull cycles typically have two phases. They note that while the initial stage sees Bitcoin outperforming the alt market, it is followed by the second phrase. The latter is a period where altcoins gain prominence. This shift, according to Pantera, comes as investors seek higher-growth tokens driven by innovations, leading to altcoins outperforming Bitcoin.\n\nIf the rate cuts coincide with the halving schedule, Bitcoin is expected to clock in major gains. However, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance, which was almost 55% last week, has come down. As per TradingView, it stands at 51% at the time of writing. As investors increasingly turn towards altcoins, the market could see more pronounced growth in the broader market, but that is what can keep Bitcoin range-bound.\n\nGiven this pattern and the current macroeconomic sentiments, Bitcoin\u2019s performance in the next few weeks could continue to be in a phase of steady price action. But at this time, market confidence remains high due to the recent approval of the Bitcoin ETFs."

        "content": "Qadir Ak is the founder of Coinpedia. He has over a decade of experience writing about technology and has been covering the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2010. He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space.\n\nIn a recent analysis, Crypto World Analyst sheds light on the ongoing dynamics in the crypto market, mainly focusing on Bitcoin\u2019s recent performance. He pointed out a report suggesting that Bitcoin has completed a bearish rising wedge pattern, experiencing a downturn due to selling pressure from Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe analysis pointed out that Grayscale, a major crypto investment, recently sold approximately 10,000 Bitcoins worth over $400 million, contributing to the downward movement in Bitcoin\u2019s price. This reduction is attributed to investors moving their funds to other Bitcoin ETFs, seeking lower fees.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nOn the technical front, Bitcoin\u2019s price chart has a bearish divergence that indicates a potential reduction in bullish momentum. Bitcoin\u2019s price is likely going down, and now that it has dropped, there\u2019s a chance it might go up a bit in the short term. He said that one should not expect a huge jump, though. It\u2019s because of a small positive sign and the chance for prices to go back up slowly.\n\nThe analyst said to monitor key levels like $42,000 to $43,000. Some support exists, but reaching higher prices, like $43,000, might face challenges. It could struggle at these points even if it tries to bounce back up. It\u2019s just something to be aware of as things play out.\n\nThe analysis points out key support and resistance levels, with $40,000 identified as a critical support level. A break below this level could signal a potential trend reversal. The report encourages traders to monitor various timeframes, considering both short-term and long-term perspectives.\n\nThe analysis extends to Ethereum and other altcoins, noting similar bearish divergences and short-term challenges. Ethereum\u2019s price is expected to face reduced bullish momentum, potentially resulting in a pullback or sideways movement in the coming weeks."

        "content": "Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, experienced a sharp downturn over the week, plummeting from $49,000 to $40,300. This significant 17.8% drop can be linked to market concerns surrounding the spot BTC ETF being perceived as a \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 event, along with Grayscale\u2019s ongoing liquidation of its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nDuring this decline, sellers managed to break through the support trendline of the rising wedge pattern, suggesting that the Bitcoin price may be set for additional correction.\n\nadvertisement\n\nReversal Pattern Signals a New Correction Trend in Action\n\nA rising wedge pattern formation reflects the maturity of a recovery phase.\n\nThe BTC price above the 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci retracement level reflects the buyers having a firm grip on this asset.\n\nThe intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $12.7 Billion, indicating a 52% loss.\n\nThe recent two-month recovery in the Bitcoin price is characterized by the emergence of a rising wedge pattern on the charts. Typically, this pattern signals a potential final surge from buyers before the cryptocurrency undergoes a substantial correction.\n\nAdditionally, the underwhelming performance of the BTC price, despite the launch of the First Spot BTC ETF, has led to a sense of demotivation and concern among investors. Consequently, on January 12th, there was a significant outflow from Bitcoin, resulting in a decisive break below the support of the wedge pattern.\n\nThis breakdown caused Bitcoin\u2019s value to plummet to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, with its price currently standing at $41,8.\n\nShould the selling pressure continue, there\u2019s a possibility of the cryptocurrency\u2019s value dropping by another 15%, potentially reaching a local support level of around $35,550.\n\nNumber Of Whales Surge At Bitcoin Price Dip\n\nWhile the near-term projection for Bitcoin price seems bearish the on-chain activity reveals a notable development to strengthen the bullish outlook. Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez recently shared on the X platform that there has been a notable rise in the count of large-scale Bitcoin investors, commonly known as \u2018whales\u2019. The tweet stated:\n\nToday marks a notable uptick in #Bitcoin whales! The number of addresses holding over 1,000 $BTC has reached its highest since August 2022, now totaling 1,510. This increase in large #BTC holders could signal strong confidence or strategic positioning in the market.\n\nIn line with this development, Should the BTC value maintain stability above the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level of around $37,200, it could significantly enhance the likelihood of a robust recovery by buyers.\n\nVortex Indicator: A bearish crossover between the VI+ and VI- slope reflects the correction trend remains in action\n\nExponential Moving Average: The coin price trading above the 100-and-200-day EMA indicates the overall trend is bullish.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "content": "El Salvador made history by becoming the first nation to embrace Bitcoin as a legal tender more than two years ago.\n\nAlthough the country\u2019s financial outlook has seen positive developments, a recent study carried out by Jos\u00e9 Sime\u00f3n Ca\u00f1as Central American University unveiled a mixed sentiment regarding the correlation between the adoption of Bitcoin and perceived improvements in personal well-being.\n\nMixed Feelings\n\nAccording to the survey, 12% of the local population in El Salvador used Bitcoin at least once to pay for goods and services in 2023. This marks a significant decrease from 2022, when the same university reported that 24.4% of Salvadorans had engaged in transactions using Bitcoin.\n\nThe decline in numbers raised questions about the sustainability and widespread acceptance of the premier crypto asset in everyday transactions.\n\nAmong those who utilized Bitcoin for transactions, nearly half \u2013 49.7% \u2013 made purchases using the crypto asset only one to three times. On the other end of the spectrum, 20% of respondents used Bitcoin for 10 transactions or more, indicating a notable difference in the frequency of crypto usage.\n\nMeanwhile, Groceries topped the list, with 22.9% of respondents using Bitcoin for grocery shopping, followed closely by supermarkets at 20.9%. A surprising 15% of respondents reported using Bitcoin for transactions at veterinary clinics, highlighting the diverse range of businesses incorporating the asset into their payment systems.\n\nThe number of respondents who felt that their family\u2019s life had improved during the past year, coinciding with Bitcoin becoming legal tender, increased from 3% in 2022 to 6.8% in 2023. While this suggests a positive association, it is important to note that the majority of respondents \u2013 93.2% \u2013 did not attribute any improvements in their lives to Bitcoin usage.\n\nContrary to the positive correlation between Bitcoin adoption and personal well-being, the survey reveals a disconnect between crypto use and perceptions of the overall economic situation in El Salvador. Only 0.5% of respondents believe Bitcoin has played a role in the country\u2019s economic improvement. Instead, more than a third of respondents \u2013 34.3% \u2013 attribute the perceived economic improvement to a decline in crime rates \u2013 24.3%.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s Advancements Thus Far\n\nOn June 9th, 2021, El Salvador\u2019s government officially endorsed legislation in the official gazette, designating the digital currency Bitcoin as legal tender within the nation. The legislation became effective on September 7th, 2021, making El Salvador the world\u2019s first country to embrace Bitcoin as legal tender formally.\n\nThis decision faced considerable criticism from mainstream media and traditional financial institutions, a sentiment that amplified during the subsequent bear market.\n\nHowever, El Salvador has made significant strides since then. The country\u2019s investment in Bitcoin proved lucrative as its portfolio turned profitable amidst the bear market, reaching $42,000 in December 2023.\n\nTaking a step further, the government collaborated with stablecoin issuer Tether to introduce the \u201cAdopting El Salvador Freedom Visa Program.\u201d Applicants are required to submit a non-refundable deposit of $999 in either Bitcoin or USDT, and successful applicants undergo a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process.\n\nIn another development, the Digital Assets Commission granted approval for El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin-backed bonds, known as Volcano Bonds. According to the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC), these bonds will be accessible on Bitfinex Securities, a regulated segment of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex."

        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\nCoinbase argues stocks, Terraform Labs and Howey in 5-hour SEC face-off\n\nUnited States District Judge Katherine Polk Failla has heard arguments from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Coinbase on the crypto exchange\u2019s motion for dismissal of a lawsuit filed by the regulator in June 2022. The hearing was held for nearly five hours and provided an extensive overview of the key arguments in courts regarding the crypto space, assets and the SEC\u2019s role in regulating the industry. During the hearing, the SEC argued that buyers of tokens are also investing in the network or ecosystem behind it, indicating there is a value proposition behind a token purchase. Coinbase\u2019s attorneys, however, challenged the argument, claiming that Bitcoin \u2014 described as a commodity by an SEC attorney during the hearing \u2014 is also backed by a community and has a network.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried\u2019s parents seek dismissal of FTX clawback lawsuit\n\nThe parents of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried are seeking to have FTX\u2019s lawsuit against them dismissed, rejecting claims that they knew about the problems at the crypto exchange and knowingly benefitted from misconduct at the firm. According to a court filing, lawyers representing Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried argued that FTX\u2019s lawsuit sought to \u201ccapitalize on the sheer fact\u201d that they were the parents of the former FTX CEO. In September 2023, FTX sued Bankman and Fried for allegedly exploiting their influence and access within the FTX empire to enrich themselves.\n\nEthereum Dencun upgrade goes live on testnet after 4-hour delay\n\nThe newest upgrade to the Ethereum network, codenamed \u201cCancun-Deneb\u201d or \u201cDencun,\u201d has gone live on the Goerli testnet for the first time, according to a Jan. 17 social media post from Ethereum developer Parithosh Jayanthi. A bug delayed the network\u2019s launch for approximately four hours. Once implemented on the mainnet, the Dencun upgrade will significantly lower the cost of transactions on Ethereum layer 2s such as Optimism, Base, Polygon zkEVM and others, developers have claimed. It will also limit self-destruct operations and allow for new bridge and staking pool features.\n\nIRS steps back crypto tax rules, exempting TXs over $10K from obligations\n\nUnited States businesses won\u2019t yet need to report cryptocurrency transactions above $10,000 to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) until the tax agency releases a regulatory framework. The decision follows a revision of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS. The law came into effect on Jan. 1 and required all U.S. businesses to report crypto transactions over $10,000. However, the tax regulator has stepped back from enforcing the rule for now. The IRS said it and the Treasury intend to issue proposed regulations concerning digital asset reporting but didn\u2019t specify when they would be introduced.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs scoop up another 10,600 BTC on day 5\n\nIssuers of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) added another net 10,667 Bitcoin to their spot products on the fifth trading day amid increasing volume.

        "content": "Sat 20 Jan 2024 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nRecently, Bitcoin experienced a financial earthquake of a rare magnitude: a massive $5 billion sell-off by a single crypto whale. This gigantic transaction, large enough to shake the foundations of the market, has raised waves of speculation and analysis. The impact of this sale, combined with other factors, led to a dizzying fall in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nThe Titanic Transaction that Shook the Bitcoin Market\n\nJanuary 12th marked a dark day for Bitcoin, with a sudden and rapid decline. The cause? A crypto whale, who had acquired over 100,000 BTC during the 2021 rise, chose to sell at $49,000 in 2024. This massive sale came in an already unstable context, exacerbated by the introduction of spot ETFs.\n\nGBTC, in particular, only sold 27,000 Bitcoins, a quantity insufficient to stabilize the market according to James Van Straten. Moreover, it is suggested that FTX has not yet liquidated its GBTC position, adding an extra layer of uncertainty.\n\nThe whale\u2019s sale triggered a domino effect: mass liquidations, panic sales, and record losses.\n\nThe already fragile market succumbed to this pressure, with repercussions that were felt well beyond the usual trading circles.\n\nThe announcement of this monumental sale took traders by surprise, overturning many strategies and projections. This action illustrated the power of whales in the crypto market. Furthermore, it highlighted the fragility of investor sentiment.\n\nA Chain Reaction of Fear and Uncertainty\n\nThe sudden fall in Bitcoin\u2019s price triggered a chain reaction of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Numerous investors, fearing further declines, quickly liquidated their positions, exacerbating the market\u2019s fall.\n\nIn this ecosystem, social media and news play a crucial role. Rapid reactions to announcements significantly influence market behavior. This phenomenon underlines the importance of quick and accurate information in the crypto sphere.\n\nTen days after the historic acceptance of Bitcoin spot ETFs, the crypto market remains in shock. This decision, which theoretically should have consolidated Bitcoin\u2019s position, was quickly overshadowed by the massive $5 billion sale by a whale.\n\nNow, forecasts for Bitcoin\u2019s future are more divided than ever. On one hand, optimists see this drop as a window of opportunity, an ideal moment to buy at low prices. On the other, more cautious voices predict a prolonged period of stagnation or even decline, as a reaction to this unexpected turbulence.\n\nBitcoin finds itself at a crucial crossroads, particularly in light of the recent spot ETF approval. The next few months will be crucial to understand whether this fall represents a mere adjustment in Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory or the prelude to a spectacular rise, propelled by increasing institutional acceptance despite the panic of the miners.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program!

        "content": "Zameer is a financial analyst and writer with a particular interest in cryptocurrency markets. He has been studying cryptocurrencies and their market behavior for several years and deeply understands the factors that affect the price of cryptocurrencies. His expertise lies in his ability to use both technical and fundamental analysis to make informed predictions about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. He has a strong understanding of market sentiment and uses this to inform his trading decisions and price predictions.\n\nCryptocurrency analyst AM Crypto predicts a significant upward move for Bitcoin, with a potential target of $52,000 in the next seven days. The analyst encourages and explains the technical indicators supporting this bullish outlook.\n\nAnalyzing the daily chart, the analyst notes that Bitcoin is below the 50-day moving average, typically considered a bearish signal. However, they anticipate a short-lived decline, with potential support around $41,000 to $42,000 before a rebound.\n\nThe analyst observes positive signs in shorter time frames, such as the 30-minute and one-hour charts, including higher lows and stochastic RSI and MACD indications that suggest a potential upward movement.\n\nWhat Next For Bitcoin Price?\n\nThe expert pointed out that a few days ago, when Bitcoin crossed the $43,372 mark, they expected its price to rise quickly. Looking at the hourly chart, they saw some positive signs compared to other time frames. The stochastic RSI showed an upward trend, and there was a technical signal called a bullish divergence.\n\nHowever, the expected positive effect of this divergence hadn\u2019t happened yet, as Bitcoin\u2019s price remained below $43,000. The price seemed to be slowly going up, and for this trend to continue, it needed to stay above a certain line on the chart, pending further confirmation.\n\nThe analysis also considers key resistance levels, particularly at $42,800, and highlights the importance of breaking these levels for a sustained move higher. The analyst noted that the overall trend remains upward, with a potential breakout toward $52,000.\n\nFactors contributing to this bullish scenario include historical patterns where Bitcoin tends to rally after consolidating for an extended period. Additionally, the imbalance in liquidity on the monthly chart suggests a potential move toward $52,000. The analysis concludes with a reminder of the potential for surprise moves in the cryptocurrency market and advises caution."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency analysts are currently divided on the future trajectory of Bitcoin (BTC) in relation to Ethereum (ETH), its closest counterpart in market capitalization ranking.\n\nOne prominent analyst, known by the handle @hedge__x on X has predicted that Bitcoin\u2019s price will experience an upward trajectory in the current market cycle.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHowever, the forecast comes with a caution \u2013 the analyst suggests that despite the optimism, many investors might find themselves disappointed if the peak only reaches $100,000.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Ascent Signals Potential\n\nAmidst the varied sentiments surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s projected peak, there is a prevailing belief in the crypto space that Ethereum (ETH) holds significant upside potential.\n\nThe analyst highlighted Ethereum as a potentially more lucrative investment compared to Bitcoin. Similar predictions were made at the start of January that Ethereum would reach $10,000 which prompted a series of debates and analysis.\n\nThis perspective is anchored in the anticipation of several catalysts, prominently the potential introduction of an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) product for Ethereum. The sentiment echoes through the crypto community, suggesting that while Bitcoin may experience a peak at $100,000, Ethereum is poised for more substantial gains.\n\nThe ongoing discussion around Bitcoin\u2019s peak performance and Ethereum\u2019s potential rise highlights the complex dynamics that shape the perceptions of analysts and investors in this rapidly evolving market.\n\nFor instance, Samson Mow recently made a big claim on the X platform in his Silver comparison as the \u201cpoor man\u2019s gold.\u201d In the post, he also took a jab at Ethereum, comparing it to the link between silver and gold. He even made a direct claim that Ethereum is the \u201cstupid man\u2019s Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBrighter Upsides for ETH\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of the cryptocurrency market, analysts and investors diligently scrutinize multiple factors to make informed predictions and investment decisions. According to some market analysts, Ethereum (ETH) is poised to overtake Bitcoin as the dominant player in the market in 2024.\n\nRegulatory developments, technological advancements, and market trends are among the critical aspects under constant observation. The overall market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market is alluded to by the analyst @hedge__x\u2019s reference of \u201cTotal2\u201d in his analysis.\n\nAs debates rages on in the crypto community, attention will be on Ethereum (ETH), especially as the protocol is undergoing one of its most important upgrades thus far \u2013 the Dencun Upgrade."

        "title": "Slamdance Film Review: The Bitcoin Car - SLUG Magazine",
        "content": "Film Reviews\n\nSlamdance Film Review: The Bitcoin Car\n\nDirector: Trygve Luktvasslimo\n\nPremiere: 01.20\n\nSinging electrons, a herd of goats named after STDs and a beautiful young farm girl walk into a Norwegian Bitcoin mine. Now, stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before, although I doubt you have. The Bitcoin Car is a dark and campy Norwegian musical-comedy with a lot to say, and they say it well (and through song). The Bitcoin Car is written, directed and edited by Trygve Luktvasslimo (The Vegan Toothbrush, Shallow Water Blackout) in his feature film debut and gorgeously shot by director of photography, Rasmus West (Till Dr\u00f6mmarnas Land). This is not a film to skip out on, even if you\u2019re a self-proclaimed musical hater.\n\nThe film starts with the model, younger brother Lukas (no guys, he\u2019s a model, literally) of our lead Gloria (Sunniva Birkeland Johansen) flying home to visit his sister on her farm in Norway. Unbeknownst to Lukas (Henrik Paus), Gloria\u2014along with the rest of the residents of their island\u2014decided to sell the graveyard where their loved ones are buried while receiving a substantial compensation from a Bitcoin mine to not relocate their bodies. Keeping the money to herself, even though it\u2019s both Gloria\u2019s and Lukas\u2019 parents buried there, Gloria goldplates her old Toyota Corolla and fixes up her idyllic farmhouse with the money. Things take a turn for the worst, however, when Gloria and the other islanders start seeing the effects that the Bitcoin mine takes on their land.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack in the film\u2019s (now fairly uncommon) 94-minute runtime. Luktvasslimo attempts to explain what exactly cryptocurrency is (spoiler alert: still, no one understands) all while taking us on an emotionally complex and musically comedic journey of Gloria. The film not only covers Gloria\u2019s repercussions from agreeing to this deal but also identifies themes of love, existentialism, death and the never ending cycle that is existence and how it comes for all of us in some way eventually. The film also draws a lot of interesting parallels between the \u201cold-school\u201d way of mining and its comparison to this present day way of \u201cbitcoin mining.\u201d\n\nI understand how a foreign musical-comedy with a title like The Bitcoin Car could scare away a lot of viewers, but this is a film done right. Luktvasslimo works overtime to give each individual character a backstory and motivation then finds a way to interweave all of them together to make one coherent story and goal for everyone to achieve. West then takes all that Luktvasslimo is trying to say and curates some of the most visually stunning and intentional frames I\u2018ve seen in recent years. The duo are a match made in electron heaven. The casting itself is also an impressive feat. Johansen, Paus and Johannes Winther Farstad, who plays Gloria\u2019s love interest Viljami, each have multiple moments throughout where they absolutely steal the scene they\u2019re in.\n\nA lot of the humor in this film comes from its sporadically\u2014yet never missing the mark\u2014timed musical numbers. With songs like \u201cViljami Karjalainen\u201d and \u201cDeath Unites Us,\u201d you\u2019ll be thinking about this movie, and singing to yourself, long after it ends.\n\nIt\u2019s films like these, the weird and out-there concepts that might not be mainstream or marketable, that remind jaded artists (a.k.a. recent graduate film students like myself) why we decided to delve into the art of film in the first place: the goal is to not only say something meaningful, but to create something weird as hell that inspires those around you to keep making weird-as-hell art. I loved The Bitcoin Car and I loved that it reminded me just how much I love film. Especially the weird ones. \u2013Alliyah Uribe\n\nRead more of SLUG\u2018s comprehensive coverage of the 2024 Slamdance Film Festival."

Market charts illuminate a colossal surge in the popularity of these ETFs promptly, post-inception.\n\nAligning with this, the net inflows continued to surge this week, followed by an upswing noted in the ETFs\u2019 collective trading volume. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise appear to be corking the best ETF service providers list, attracting investors across the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, Hong Kong is setting its sights on seeking approval for the nation\u2019s first Bitcoin ETF. Venture Smart Financial Holdings Ltd, a financial services provider, shared plans for the same this week.\n\nBinance Sparks Inferences\n\nBinance, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange, issued several important notices to its users this week. The platform recently added Manta Network to its collection as Manta Pacific\u2019s TVL surpassed $800 million. Furthermore, it added a DOGE perpetual contract to its collection, offering 75x leverage.\n\nNotably, the firm also delisted specific BTC, ETH, and BNB spot trading pairs, and on the other hand, announced listing ETC, ENS, and TIA in FDUSD & USDC pairs.

        "title": "Crypto Market Weekly Review: Bitcoin Falters, While Altcoins Showed Mixed Signals - Coinpedia Fintech News",
        "content": "Sohrab is a passionate cryptocurrency news writer with over five years of experience covering the industry. He keeps a keen interest in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize finance. Whether he's trading or writing, Sohrab always keeps his finger on the pulse of the crypto world, using his expertise to deliver informative and engaging articles that educate and inspire. When he's not analyzing the markets, Sohrab indulges in his hobbies of graphic design, minimal design or listening to his favorite hip-hop tunes.\n\nWith a bullish start to the week, the Bitcoin price fails to sustain recovery, dropping back to square one as the week concludes. Further, this week, the altcoins are making waves limiting the growth as buyers struggle for a comeback.\n\nWith such a losing end to the week, the market is filled with curiosity for a trend reversal or a bounce back next week. As the technicals suggest in the analysis shared in this article, it hints at a bullish spree potentially starting next week. As the bullish dream takes a halt, the Bitcoin price prediction for 2024 is struggling to hold on to the $100,000 target.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Volatile Week Takes A Bearish Turn\n\nWith a bullish growth in the starting two days of this week, BTC price shows a recovery of 3.50%. However, starting the week\u2019s second half, Bitcoin\u2019s price fails to prolong the recovery beyond the $43K mark.\n\nHence, with the sudden loss of bullish momentum, the BTC price drops dead to the $41K support zone. Nevertheless, the increased efforts from buyers led to lower prices for rejection candles and tease a morning star pattern.\n\nThe weekly liquidation data shows $80.04 Million in short liquidations and $136.25 Million on the opposite front. With notable spikes hurting the bullsih sides during the days of correction, the bearish side projects a stronger position and warns of a downfall.\n\nWith the ongoing pivotal juncture slightly above the $40K support zone, the coming week will be crucial for the upcoming price trend in Bitcoin. The divergence in the RSI line offers a reversal possibility and attracts sideline reversal traders.\n\nHence, a bullish reversal can help the Bitcoin price revert to the $46K mark. On the flip side, a downfall under $40K can retest the $36K support zone.\n\nSecond Side Of The Crypto Coin: Altcoins\n\nDuring this tumultuous week for the crypto market, the altcoins had a bittersweet time overall. With the major coins hitting breaks, Ethereum is down by 3.69%, Binance\u2019s token BNB shows 4.36% upside, Cardano is down by 6.42%, and XRP is down by 4.60%.\n\nHeading towards the top performers and the top losers of the week. We have Flare (FLR), Siacoin (SC), and Ronin(RON) with a 7D growth of 29%, 24%, and 22%, respectively.\n\nOn the downside, we have SUI SATS and Aptos(APT), each recording a fall of 18%, 17.74%, and 17%, respectively.\n\nDeFi Market\n\nThe Total DeFi market cap has increased by 2.44% this week and shows a bullish trend of recovery continuing in 2024. The total value locked comes to $57.483 billion, a significant jump from $56.11 billion last week. However, the volume in the DeFi sector depletes from $6.92 Billion to $4.288 Billion.\n\nSource: Defillama\n\nAmongst the recovering DeFi sector, UMA, API3, and DFII.Money(YFII) are the top performers, with 154%, 52%, and 30% growth, respectively, in seven days.\n\nNFT market\n\nThe Non-Fungible Tokens market finds a bearish week as the total sales are down by 28%, and an overall market cap of $33.14B. The loss of volume is supported by a drop in active market wallets of 16%."

        "title": "The Future of Bitcoin in Light of a Spot ETF - AIER - Daily Economy News",
        "content": "On January 10, over a decade after the first Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) application, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approved eleven applications on the same day. Trading began the next day, January 11. The recent round of approvals comes after much anticipation. The first-ever application for a Bitcoin spot ETF was back in 2013, from Gemini, a company co-founded by the Winklevoss brothers. The SEC rejected Gemini\u2019s application in 2017 as well as subsequent application from the same company again in 2018.\n\nExchange-Traded Funds allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility without having to invest in Bitcoin directly. Note that the SEC usually refers to ETFs as ETPs (Exchange-Traded Products); ETFs are just one type of ETPs.\n\nThe general sentiment across the Bitcoin-sphere was one of excitement. Bitcoin Magazine called the SEC\u2019s approval \u201ca historic milestone in the evolution of Bitcoin adoption within traditional financial markets.\u201d Investor Balaji Srinivasan called it \u201cthe spiritual reversal of Executive Order 6102\u201d (referring to FDR\u2019s 1935 seizure of America\u2019s privately-held gold). For many, the SEC\u2019s reluctant approval was seen as a bit of institutional validation for Bitcoin \u2013 especially after years of dismissal by the likes of establishment figures such as Warren Buffet, Jamie Dimon, and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nEven in SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s public statement announcing the Bitcoin spot ETF approval, he warned that \u201cbitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing.\u201d (Gensler conveniently overlooks that fiat currencies, including the US dollar, are also used for all of the above).\n\nGensler also noted that the SEC essentially had little choice but to approve the Bitcoin spot ETFs since \u201cThe US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that the Commission failed to adequately explain its reasoning in disapproving the listing and trading of Grayscale\u2019s proposed ETP\u2026\u201d\n\nBut a refreshing bit of sentiment came from SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce in a statement of her own. In the statement, Peirce accused the SEC of treating Bitcoin spot ETPs unequally to (more harshly than) other types of ETP applications over the years. As she put it, \u201cThe goalposts kept moving as the Commission slapped \u2018DENIED\u2019 on application after application.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Peirce\u2019s full statement deserves a read, but the final paragraph in particular reflects what I think is a principled stance consistent with a free society:\n\nI am not celebrating bitcoin or bitcoin-related products; what one regulator thinks about bitcoin is irrelevant. I am celebrating the right of American investors to express their thoughts on bitcoin by buying and selling spot bitcoin ETPs. And I am celebrating the perseverance of market participants in trying to bring to market a product they think investors want. I commend applicants\u2019 decade-long persistence in the face of the Commission\u2019s obstruction.\n\nA personal perspective\n\nWhether regulators that happen to be more hostile to Bitcoin (and \u201ccrypto\u201d more generally) like it or not, the SEC\u2019s Bitcoin spot ETF approval does provide a strong counter-narrative to the \u201cBitcoin is for drugs, money laundering\u201d objection. The approval certainly has the potential to substantially increase Bitcoin\u2019s purchasing power over time (which we can easily measure using its fiat-denominated price) as new institutional money flows into Bitcoin.\n\nThere are two things to watch for here, however: one regarding Bitcoin\u2019s consensus and the other regarding self-custody.\n\n1. Consensus\n\nAs Bitcoin has a highly-decentralized governance model, no single stakeholder or multiple colluding stakeholders (miners, full node operators, programmers, users, exchanges, wallet providers, payment processors) are able to change it to their own benefit without reaching an overall consensus from the others. Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin\u2019s creator, understood incentives and a bit of game theory.\n\nAs huge financial institutions increase their holdings (directly or indirectly) of Bitcoin over time, there is likely to be enormous pressure to bend Bitcoin\u2019s rules towards, say, compliance with the US Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions. (To understand the present regulatory climate, note that in 2022, OFAC began sanctioning crypto mining operations in Russia and even Ether wallet addresses alleged to be connected to North Korean hackers).\n\nIn Bitcoin, existing norms serve as a Schelling point: a consensus point where people converge without much coordination. As such, it isn\u2019t difficult to imagine a so-called hardfork happening over competing visions of the Bitcoin protocol, resulting in a split into two separate coins, both calling themselves \u201cBitcoin\u201d (this wouldn\u2019t be the first time). The first \u201cBitcoin\u201d would be regulator-friendly and institutionally backed. The second would be a permissionless, censorship-resistant, \u201cOG\u201d Bitcoin, as I will refer to it here for simplicity.\n\nIf such a split were to happen, we could imagine regulators in the United States and Europe, for example, forbidding cryptocurrency exchanges from facilitating trades of the \u201cOG\u201d Bitcoin that exists today. Additionally, miners of the \u201cOG\u201d Bitcoin could come under heavy attack for various reasons (with a green energy agenda, for example), pushing their operations to countries less politically aligned with the United States and Europe. (And, as a side note, this would even further complicate the American and European governments\u2019 ability to sanction any country at will).\n\nTo be clear, none of these attacks on the free and open \u201cOG\u201d Bitcoin payment network would kill it. Far from it. But it does push its stakeholders to the fringes, legally speaking. Additionally, what Bitcoin\u2019s political and regulatory enemies overlook is that the more they ramp up attacks against it using (sometimes) legally questionable and authoritarian means, the more they \u2013 quite ironically \u2013 increase the value proposition for a free and open payment network. That is, crackdowns against it create new demand for it. This is because people who find themselves living in authoritarian regimes seek out tools to maintain some element of human dignity.\n\n2. Self-custody\n\nAs for self-custody, it is worth a quick revisit of what Satoshi originally had in mind. His whitepaper called Bitcoin a \u201cPeer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\u201d Peer-to-peer meant no centralized third-party custodians needed. In fact, getting away from centralized third-parties altogether was the key breakthrough that Bitcoin achieved after a couple of decades of Cypherpunk debates and previous attempts. (See my detailed table for more on this).\n\nAs David Waugh rightly noted, taking self-custody of Bitcoin yourself protects you against a government that \u201cmight be able to seize the asset manager\u2019s bitcoin or order it to liquidate the ETF.\u201d\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the US Treasury Department refers to self-custody (\u201cnon-custodial\u201d) cryptocurrency wallets in a sort of derogatory manner, labeling them \u201cunhosted wallets\u201d \u2013 a name that implies that a legitimate way of doing payments (from Treasury\u2019s point of view) is for cryptocurrency users to trust third parties (a \u201chost\u201d) that can be easily coerced by the regulatory apparatus to hand over user funds at will. But even if we dismiss the risk of a predatory state, the exchanges themselves can be unreliable, to say the least. Blockchain analytical service Glassnode noted that in the aftermath of the FTX collapse of November 2022, both institutional and retail users withdrew funds from centralized exchanges, en masse, resulting in significant net outflows, with users moving funds into self-custody. Self-custody radically protects property rights.\n\nFinal words\n\nWhile the SEC\u2019s long-overdue approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF deserves a bit of celebration, watch out for what\u2019s next. The state apparatus will, for the most part, increasingly treat Bitcoin as a regulated financial product \u2013 something that BlackRock and the rest of Wall Street can profit from. As such, it is likely to turn even more hostile to the peer-to-peer open payment network concept that Satoshi envisioned. Nation-states remain jealous of Bitcoin\u2019s competition with their inflationary monopoly money."

The asset management titan removed existing crypto products from its platform, meaning it offers no exposure to cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis decision aligns with Vanguard\u2019s established conservative investment principles, which trace back to late founder Jack Bogle\u2019s disrespect for commodities he viewed as lacking permanent value.\n\nAs other major players like BlackRock and Fidelity launch spot Bitcoin ETFs amid major hype, Vanguard is sticking to its old view to avoid risky assets.\n\nThe BoycottVanguard campaign that emerged on social media is unlikely to impact the firm meaningfully. Vanguard continues to attract assets rapidly, taking in $4.4 billion last week.\n\nIts low fees and unique corporate structure cultivate extreme customer loyalty, shielding it from defection over the crypto decision.\n\nWhile the insult could eventually separate younger investors, that risk appears marginal next to Vanguard\u2019s broad mainstream appeal."

While he has always received backlash for these statements, this time around, he was defended by the Conbase CEO Brian Armstrong.\n\nCoinbase and JPMorgan got each others\u2019 back\n\nJPMorgan CEO recently, for one last time, lashed out at Bitcoin during the World Economic Forum at Davos. Dimon stated that Bitcoin\u2019s use cases are limited to avoiding tax, anti-money laundering as well as for conducting fraud and sex trafficking.\n\nHe went on to add that while he did not want to tell other people what to do, his personal advice was to get involved. He added that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are nothing but \u201cpet rocks\u201d that do nothing.\n\nThis statement of his came a month after Dimon requested Senator Elizabeth Warren to shut Bitcoin down. But at the same time, he noted that he doesn\u2019t care for the involvement of the likes of BlackRock and other asset managers being involved with spot BTC ETFs and that this was the last time he would ever publicly speak about digital assets.\n\nThis was addressed by Cathie Wood, ARK Invest\u2019s Founder and CEO, who stated,\n\n\u201cIn 2004, I remember that one of the reasons investors were excited that JPMorgan bought Bank One was that its CEO, Jamie Dimon, was so tech savvy. Tech oriented investors at the time admired him enormously. Jamie, I would like to introduce you to Brian Armstrong.\n\nInterestingly, despite being an inherent member of the crypto space, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong chose to defend Dimon instead of berating him as he tweeted,\n\nWe\u2019ve met, and JPM has been a great partner to us. Even if we don\u2019t fully agree on Bitcoin, I have a lot of respect for Jamie as a CEO and have learned a lot from him.

        "content": "As the weekend unfolds, Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a notable uptick, trading at $41,700 with nearly 1.40% increase on Saturday. Despite this positive momentum, skepticism remains as The New York Times maintains a cautious stance on Bitcoin\u2019s prospects. Adding to the wary outlook, the RBI Governor has flagged cryptocurrencies as a risk to the stability of the Indian Rupee, urging investors to proceed with caution.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has reported a loss of $2.3 million by the cryptocurrency exchange Debiex due to alleged romance scams, highlighting the vulnerabilities within the crypto space. Furthermore, the strength of the US Dollar Index (DXY) is seen as a potential threat to Bitcoin\u2019s recovery, compounded by the selling pressure from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\n\nWith such diverse factors at play, investors are pondering whether it\u2019s the opportune moment to buy into Bitcoin and Ethereum as the latter taps the $2,500 mark.\n\nRBI Governor Cautions: Cryptocurrency Threatens Rupee Stability\n\n\n\nGovernor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Shaktikanta Das, has spoken about the serious risks that come with cryptocurrencies, particularly for developing nations. Das underlined the possible effects on the monetary system, currency stability, and financial stability. He voiced worries about cryptocurrencies\u2019 lack of underlying assets and their ability to replace money in payment systems and banking.\n\nDas highlights the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies and sees considerable risks, even in spite of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission having approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The governor\u2019s cautious approach increases the regulatory obstacles that cryptocurrencies must overcome and may lead to more volatility in the market.\n\nCFTC Reports: Debiex Exchange Hit by $2.3M Romance Scams\n\n\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has labeled cryptocurrency exchange Debiex as a \u201cfraudulent digital asset platform,\u201d accusing its senior staff of orchestrating romantic deceptions to defraud money.\n\nCFTC Charges Bogus Digital Asset Platform with Fraud and Misappropriation in an Online Romance Scam: https://t.co/RpskNapy7i \u2014 CFTC (@CFTC) January 19, 2024\n\nThe CFTC\u2019s report alleges that Debiex representatives engaged in forming intimate relationships with potential clients, gaining their trust, and subsequently persuading them to open and fund trading accounts. This scheme reportedly siphoned over $2 million, with five victims currently identified over two years.\n\nThese romance scam allegations add to a series of challenges within the cryptocurrency industry, potentially impacting investor sentiment and activity by undermining the trust and credibility of crypto exchanges.\n\nUS Dollar Rally and GBTC Sell-Off Endanger Bitcoin\u2019s Recovery\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index\u2019s (DXY) rally, up 2.71% from its December 27 low, poses a challenge to Bitcoin\u2019s price recovery. Bolstered by robust retail sales and positive economic data, the DXY has seen significant gains. Concurrently, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has experienced substantial outflows, with around 38,000 BTC withdrawn since January 11, when spot Bitcoin ETFs were introduced.\n\nEconomist Peter Schiff attributes these GBTC outflows as a key factor preventing Bitcoin\u2019s price rise. Technical analysis suggests Bitcoin could potentially fall back to around $34,000, having been repelled at the $48,000 level, which aligns with the upper limit of an ascending parallel channel."

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Jan. 19 opened comments on proposals related to options trading on Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOne SEC notice concerns a proposed rule change allowing Nasdaq to list and trade options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nA second SEC notice concerns a proposed rule change that would allow Cboe Exchange Inc. to list and trade options on various Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs). Though the text of the notice does not indicate which funds the proposal applies to, Cboe BZX is responsible for listing and trading the majority of spot Bitcoin ETFs approved this January, including those from Ark Invest, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity, GlobalX, and Franklin Templeton.\n\nOptions trading would introduce new investment strategies for each fund. Specifically, this approach would allow investors to engage in leveraged trading, potentially earning greater returns at a higher risk.\n\nSEC could decide on approval in coming months\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart commented on the development, noting:\n\n\u201cThe SEC has already acknowledged the 19b-4\u2019s requesting the ability to trade options on spot Bitcoin ETFs. This is faster than SEC typically moves. Options could be approved before end of February if SEC wants to move fast?\u201d\n\nSeyffart\u2019s other statements indicate the SEC could make its a decision around Feb. 15 at the earliest, or around Sept. 21 at the latest.\n\nSeyffart also noted that each proposal was posted on Jan. 16, meaning that the SEC published its latest notices after three days. He said the latest developments are \u201csignificantly faster\u201d than other 19b-4 rule change proposals, which reached similar stages after more than 14 days.\n\nThe text of each document, however, indicates slightly earlier filing dates for each proposal. Nasdaq (on behalf of BlackRock) filed its proposal on Jan. 9 and submitted an amendment on Jan. 11. Cboe filed its proposal on Jan. 5.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Bitcoin dumped once more yesterday to a new monthly low of under $40,500, but it reacted well and dumped above $42,000 hours later.\n\nThe altcoins continue to be quite sluggish, with little to no movements, aside from LINK, which has jumped by around 5%.\n\nBTC\u2019s Declines\n\nThe primary cryptocurrency had two completely different weeks. Last week, it soared past $49,000 on the day that 11 spot BTC ETFs reached the US markets and dumped by more than three grand later. The landscape worsened as Friday was coming to an end. Overall, BTC had lost over $7,000 in about 36 hours in what turned out to be a sell-the-news event.\n\nAfter recovering some ground and reaching $43,000 during the weekend, the asset calmed and traded sideways for almost a week. However, another price decline occurred yesterday when Bitcoin dropped below $41,000 and then to $40,400 (on Bitstamp) for the first time in over a month.\n\nIt managed to bounce off and even soared past $42,000 briefly, but the overall negative sentiment kept the pressure on, and BTC dropped back down to $41,500, where it stands now as well.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets.

LINK has jumped by more than 5% and trades above $16. Cardano\u2019s native token follows suit with a 3% increase that has pushed the asset to over $0.5. Uniswap and Litecoin are also well in the green, followed by Dogecoin, Tron, and Binance Coin.\n\nIn contrast, Avalanche has retraced by 4% to $32, Solana is down by 3% and is close to breaking below $90, and MATIC has shed 3% of value and is down to $0.76.\n\nFurther losses come from the likes of ARB, LDO, OP, INJ, and NEAR. The total crypto market cap has declined by about $10 billion overnight but still stands inches above $1.6 trillion on CMC."

        "title": "Here's Why Bitcoin (BTC) Price Is Falling After Spot Bitcoin ETFs: CryptoQuant - CoinGape",
        "content": "Bitcoin price loses steam after the spot Bitcoin ETFs\u2019 approval and listing on exchanges, falling over 15% from $48,969 to $40,297. In a paradigm shift, trading volumes dropped significantly on crypto exchanges..\n\nMoreover, there\u2019s a narrative in the market over Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) selling Bitcoin holdings, but CryptoQuant team asserts it\u2019s not actually the case. They also predict a short-term correction.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBitcoin Selling By Holders\n\nCryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno, said it\u2019s a wrong narrative circulating in the market that the current Bitcoin price correction is due to GBTC selling Bitcoin holdings.\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) sold about 60K bitcoins, but other 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise have a combined net purchase of about 72K bitcoins. It indicates that the inflow is indeed increasing, with trading volumes exceeding billions.\n\nThe Bitcoin selloff has come from holders including short-term traders and whales. They capitalized on the \u201csell-the-news\u201d event to book profit of the recent rally.\n\n\u201cSeveral On-chain metrics and indicators still suggest the price correction may not be over or at least that a new rally is still not on the cards. Short-term traders and large Bitcoin holders are still doing significant selling in the context of a risk-off attitude. Additionally, unrealized profit margins have not fallen enough for sellers to be exhausted,\u201d as per CryptoQuant insights.\n\nPopular analyst CredibleCrypto noted that definitive data is proving that ETF flows are net positive at +5,000 Bitcoin bought per day since launch, which is 10 times the effect of the upcoming halving. However, recent \u201cPA doesn\u2019t seem to reflect that. This literally proves that there are other, more significant factors at play that have a greater influence on PA in the short/mid term.\u201d\n\nRead More: Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Inflows of $33.1 Million on Day 6\n\nBTC Price To Witness Short-Term Correction\n\nCryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju in a post on January 20 revealed that Bitcoin in distribution phase is not fully distributed to retailers. He warns about a short-term correction in BTC price, after a 15% correction in the last few days.\n\nHowever, he added that this long-term bull market cycle will continue until Bitcoin is fully distributed to retailers. The long-term outlook remains positive.\n\nBTC price jumped 1% in the past 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $41,659. The 24-hour low and high are $40,297 and $42,134, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has decreased by 16% in the last 24 hours, indicating a decline in interest among traders.\n\nAlso Read:"
