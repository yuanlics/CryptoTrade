        "content": "Has bitcoin historically enhanced portfolio returns?\n\nFidelity found that bitcoin boosted a portfolio's returns during specific periods in the past, though it also came with substantial volatility.\n\nFrom August 1, 2010 (when monthly pricing for bitcoin first became available) to August 31, 2022 (the study's defined end date), bitcoin generated average annual returns of 186.7%. Note that a significant portion of these gains were made in the early days of trading, which may have experienced more volatility than it will see going forward.\n\nIn 2018, the bitcoin futures market launched, which enhanced pricing efficiency and brought in new market participants. Since that time, bitcoin has generated average annual returns of roughly 8.8%.\n\nOf course, it's important to note that past performance is no guarantee of future results. Bitcoin is an emerging asset that comes with extreme volatility. Investors should keep in mind that its value has both the potential to significantly increase or decline in the future, as year-to-date performance has shown.\n\nTo help analyze bitcoin's risk, Fidelity ran a simulation that added varying amounts to a traditional 60/40 portfolio (i.e., a mix of 60% stocks and 40% bonds). This was based on historical performance of all assets from January 1, 2018 (after the first bitcoin futures contracts started trading) to August 31, 2022. The goal was to evaluate the proportion of risk bitcoin would account for if it replaced part of the stock portion, bond portion, or equal amounts of both stocks and bonds.\n\nThe study found that even a small allocation of bitcoin meaningfully increased volatility, which includes both increases and decreases in simulated prices. For example, replacing 1% of the stock or bond portion (or 0.5% from each) with bitcoin contributed about 3% of the portfolio's overall volatility. The study also found that the risks increase exponentially. Replacing 5% of the stock portion, or 2.5% from both stocks and bonds, with bitcoin contributed 21% of portfolio volatility."

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nThomas Trutschel | Photothek | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin continued its climb Monday as traders took news of another crypto bankruptcy in their stride and placed bets on a Federal Reserve \"pivot\" to cutting interest rates. The price of the No. 1 token briefly topped $23,100 Monday, after touching $23,333.83 Saturday for the first time since Aug. 19, according to Coin Metrics. The jump brings bitcoin up almost 39% since the start of January. Ether , the second-biggest digital coin, rallied as high as $1,664.78 on Saturday. That's the first time it has surpassed $1,600 since Nov. 7, 2022. It was last trading at $1,637.40 apiece. Bitcoin has kicked off 2023 on a positive note, with investors hoping for a reversal in the monetary tightening that spooked market players last year. The Fed and other central banks began cutting interest rates in 2022, shocking holders of risky asset classes, like stocks and digital tokens. Publicly-listed tech stocks and private venture capital-backed start-ups particularly took a beating, as investors sought protection in assets perceived as safer, such as cash and bonds.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon A chart showing bitcoin's year-to-date price performance; the digital currency has climbed nearly 39% since the start of January.\n\nWith inflation now showing signs of cooling in the U.S., some market players are hopeful that central banks will start easing the pace of rate rises, or even slash rates. Economists previously told CNBC they predict a Fed rate cut could happen as soon as this year. \"Fed tightening seems to be lighter and inflation less of a risk,\" Charles Hayter, CEO of crypto data site CryptoCompare, said in emailed comments to CNBC. \"There is hope there will be more caution to rate rises globally.\" The Fed is likely to keep interest rates high for the time being. However, some officials at the bank have recently called for a reduction in the size of quarterly rate hikes, wary of a slowdown in economic activity. The world's top digital currency, bitcoin, is \"increasingly looking like it has put in its bottom,\" according to Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno. Bitcoin short sellers have been squeezed by sudden upward moves in prices, according to Ayyar. Short selling is an investment strategy whereby traders borrow an asset and then sell it in the hope that it will depreciate in value. A wipe-out of those short positions sparked by the rising price of bitcoin has added \"fuel to the fire,\" Ayyar said, as short sellers are forced to cover their bets by buying back the borrowed bitcoin to close them out.\n\nWhat crypto collapse?\n\nInvestors don't seem to have been greatly perturbed by the collapses of top crypto companies, stemming from the fallout of digital currency exchange FTX's insolvency in November.\n\nLast week, the lending arm of New York-based crypto investment firm Genesis became the latest casualty of the crypto crisis, seeking bankruptcy protection in a \"mega\" filing listing aggregate liabilities ranging from $1.2 billion to $11 billion. \"The Genesis debacle has been playing out for a while and is likely priced in already. FTX, on the other hand, has already had a significant impact on many investors, on market psychology and on the prices of several toxic assets,\" Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of crypto investment advisory firm Quantum Economics, told CNBC. \"It should be noted however that the price on bitcoin itself is quite limited since FTX didn't have any on their balance sheets.\" Bitcoin is still about 67% off its all-time high, despite its recent surge. The latest crypto plunge is different from past cycles, in large part due to the role played by leverage. Major crypto players became entangled in risky lending practices, offering lofty yields that many investors now say were unsustainable. This began in May with the collapse of terraUSD \u2014 or UST \u2014 an algorithmic stablecoin that was supposed to be pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar. The failure of UST brought down terraUSD's sister token luna and hit companies with exposure to both tokens. Three Arrows Capital, a hedge fund with bullish views on crypto, plunged into liquidation because of its exposure to terraUSD. Then came the November collapse of FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. It was run by Sam Bankman-Fried, an executive who was often in the spotlight. The fallout from FTX continues to ripple across the cryptocurrency industry. Roughly $2 trillion of value has been erased from the overall crypto market since the peak of the crypto boom in November 2021, in a deep downturn known as \"crypto winter.\"\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "Bitcoin ATMs, synonymous with crypto ATMs or BTMs, are automated teller machines that allow users to buy or sell Bitcoin on-the-go using cash, debit or a cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nWhat Is a Bitcoin ATM? Bitcoin ATMs are standalone, internet-enabled kiosks that facilitate cryptocurrency-related transactions, most notably buying Bitcoin with cash.\n\nWhile traditional fiat kiosks connect a user to their bank account to perform an assortment of services, Bitcoin ATMs are still primarily one-way operations, where users feed cash into the machine to purchase digital currency. Newer models, such as Coin Cloud ATMs, allow users to withdraw cash for crypto, create a printed paper wallet and direct purchased Bitcoin to a hardware wallet.\n\nThese standalone, internet-connected kiosks generally comprise a touch screen interface, QR scanner, bill acceptor and dispenser.\n\n\u201cUnlike traditional ATMs, crypto ATMs don\u2019t require customers to have a bank account ... This means that anyone who is interested in investing [in crypto] can start building a portfolio immediately.\u201d\n\nCrypto-compatible ATMs can be found near specialty shops, grocery stores, gas stations, airports, restaurants, banks and malls. Users can check online sites, such as this map posted on Bitcoin\u2019s website, to locate one of the 38,638 Bitcoin ATMs worldwide nearest to them.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency ATMs make cryptocurrency accessible through their easy-to-use technologies while also lowering barriers to entry for investors,\u201d said Daniel Polotsky, founder and chairman of the board at CoinFlip, the third-largest Bitcoin ATM operator in the United States. CoinFlip hosts 10 percent of crypto ATMs nationwide, which offer instant access to an assortment of leading digital currencies.\n\n\u201cUnlike traditional ATMs, crypto ATMs don\u2019t require customers to have a bank account,\u201d Polotsky said, \u201cThis means that anyone who is interested in investing [in crypto] can start building a portfolio immediately.\u201d\n\nMore on Starting a Crypto Portfolio How to Invest in Cryptocurrency\n\nHow Do Bitcoin ATMs Work?\n\nThe installment of Bitcoin ATMs put passersby just a few steps away from crypto exchanges. Like a traditional bank auto-teller, there are instructions to guide users through a reasonably intuitive process.\n\n\u201cDepending on the size of your transaction [and the ATM model], all that\u2019s required is cash, a crypto wallet and a phone number,\u201d Polotsky said. Identification may be needed for transactions of a higher amount. Other than that, Polotsky advised to have a crypto wallet set up before visiting a kiosk.\n\n\u201cA crypto wallet is necessary to securely store your assets,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow along to learn how to interact with a crypto teller the next time you see one in the wild.\n\nHow to Use a Bitcoin ATM\n\nStep one: A user must activate the screen by touching the monitor. Then, they would select whether to buy or sell Bitcoin and disclose the value range they wish to buy or sell within on the following screen.\n\nStep two: Depending on the selected option, a user may then be prompted to provide identification. Some Bitcoin ATMs require one to verify a phone number, take a photo and/or scan a government-issued ID, such as a driver\u2019s license or passport, in order to prevent fraud for all transactions. Transactions of a lower amount, however, typically require little to no identification. This machine, found in a Canadian mall, for example, has a set threshold of $3,000 Canadian dollars, or around $2,250 U.S. dollars, and only requires the user\u2019s crypto wallet address to perform the transaction.\n\nFrom here, the steps will vary in respect to a user\u2019s needs.\n\nWhen Buying\n\nStep three: Crypto wallet addresses are necessary to record a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. At this stage, a user would then provide their wallet address by scanning the QR code associated with the account.\n\nStep four: Cash is inserted into the ATM\u2019s bill feeder for the desired amount of Bitcoin.\n\nStep five: The ATM processes the transaction. The ATM will deposit bitcoin in one\u2019s bitcoin wallet, which may take up to 10 minutes depending on network traffic.\n\nWhen Selling\n\nStep three: After the appropriate level of identification is submitted, the user would then input the exact amount they want to sell. If they haven\u2019t already in the previous step, the user may be prompted to input a phone number in order to receive an SMS notification once the machine has successfully processed the transaction.\n\nStep four: Once the sale amount is finalized, a receipt prints, containing instructions and a QR code. Stepping away from the machine, the user must send their Bitcoin to the code provided, an address linked to the ATM machine, within a specified amount of time using a smartphone. Here, the user accesses their crypto wallet via their app of choice, scans the QR code, hits send and authorizes the transaction.\n\nStep five: The ATM will then process the transaction, which may take up to 10 minutes. If the user inputted a phone number, they will get a text informing them when the withdrawal is ready.\n\nStep six: With ticket in hand, the user returns to the machine, but selects \u201credeem ticket\u201d instead of \u201csell\u201d on the options menu. Once the user scans the QR code, the ATM processes the request and dispenses the sale amount in cash.\n\nFind out who's hiring.

Re-introducing new tech in recognizable forms benefits those that may want to participate but have otherwise felt too intimidated to get involved.\n\n\u201cATMs are a familiar way for people to interact with conducting financial transactions,\u201d Chen said, noting their potential to welcome in a new wave of crypto investors.\n\nNo Bank Account or Identification Required\n\nChen, who is also an early stage Silicon Valley-based investor and lectures about the future of finance and entrepreneurship at the University of California, Berkeley, also pointed out that some individuals may opt for a Bitcoin ATM as their ability to work in the medium of cash allows users to forgo any type of banking that may need to be arranged prior to a transaction.\n\nPrivacy\n\nOn that note, Bitcoin ATMs offer an unmatched level of privacy. With online exchanges, users are required to share sensitive information, including debit or credit card details or bank account information in order to buy and sell Bitcoin. Bitcoin ATMs users only need to share minimal information.\n\nFurthermore, Chen highlights the new level of anonymity \u2014 or pseudonymity \u2014 that Bitcoin ATMs provide users, as some machines only require a phone number and do not require users to input any personal identification at all.\n\nMore on Anonymity in Blockchain What Role Does Anonymity Play in Web3?\n\nChallenges (and Risks) of Bitcoin ATMs\n\nAt a time when countries are still grappling with cryptocurrency as a whole, Bitcoin ATMs add another layer of complexity that governing agencies must consider. Fortunately, with traditional banking networks well established, a system of regulation already exists.\n\nChallenges and Risks of Using a Bitcoin ATM High fees\n\nUninsured funds\n\nTransaction limits\n\nAvailability\n\nFraud and scams\n\nFor instance, in the United States, all Bitcoin ATM companies are bound by federal anti-money laundering laws. This means that every operator must register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act. Even so, regulation so far has been lax at best, as found by a New Jersey oversight agency, CNBC reported, with law enforcement officials convinced that the machines are aiding in illicit activity such as money laundering and drug trafficking. As Politico points out, \u201cLegitimate companies may run most of these machines, but some are set up by unlicensed operators.\u201d\n\nHigh Fees\n\nSky-high fees are the main deterrent for active crypto users when it comes to visiting a Bitcoin ATM.\n\nIn traditional banking, flat rates are incurred for out-of-network usage. These rates have an average combined cost of $4.66, as found by Bankrate in a 2022 study, and an average surcharge that presents as $3.14 per transaction.\n\nBitcoin ATMs, however, charge a percentage based on the transaction amount. Most operators charge a 15 percent fee to buy Bitcoin and anywhere from 0 to 15 percent to sell, according to crypto kiosk mapping service Coin ATM Radar. Comparatively, that same transaction made on an online crypto exchange would likely sustain a 1.5 percent transaction, or \u201cgas,\u201d fee, which have historically ranged from under 1 percent to under 5 percent.\n\nUninsured Funds\n\nIn lieu of bank backing, Bitcoin ATMs do not provide insurance against theft or loss. If there are issues with a transaction, customer support may not be as readily available as well-established institutions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for investors to do their own research and consider self-custodial options,\u201d Polotsky said, which may be as simple as vetting any third-party involvement \u2014 such as an exchange or digital wallet provider \u2014 and routinely storing one\u2019s crypto offline, in cold storage. Accountability from both ends, users and providers, is ideal.\n\n\u201cWe use proactive blockchain analytics to proactively determine whether a wallet is connected to any criminal activity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it is, we block the wallet address so that it cannot be used for transactions at CoinFlip.\u201d\n\nTransaction Limits\n\nSimilar to both traditional bank auto-tellers as well as online crypto exchanges, Bitcoin ATMs exercise a daily transaction limit. According to Investopedia, this range typically spans from $10 to $10,000, but it depends on the operator. For example, Polotsky\u2019s company CoinFlip features four tiers, with the lowest ranging from $20 to $900 and the highest from $8,005 to a maximum of $16,000 per day.\n\nAvailability\n\nWhile Bitcoin ATMs have multiplied by the thousands in the decade since inception, they\u2019re no match for online exchanges in terms of availability, which remain just a web search away.\n\nFraud and Scams\n\nThe FBI discovered a trend where scammers leveraged Bitcoin ATMs, phishing emails and QR code tech to trick victims in fraudulent schemes. These cybercriminals would couple a QR code \u2014 containing the scammer\u2019s wallet address \u2014 with an urgent message via email, then direct the victim to a physical crypto ATM to complete the transaction, according to the FBI.\n\n\u201cIt is important for users to be aware of these risks and take steps to protect their personal information when using a crypto kiosk.\u201d\n\nBitcoin ATMs also provide easily accessible, hard-to-trace outlets for crypto users with ill intent. A lack of identification could have unknowing victims lose out on their funds in the event their private key is discovered, whether through their own mishandling or covert measures.\n\n\u201cData sniffers and spy cameras can be installed into these ATMs, allowing criminals to steal a user\u2019s personal information, which can be used to steal their cryptocurrency in the future,\u201d said Kemmerer of CoinLedger. Additionally, crypto ATM operators may try to complicate oversight efforts designed to prevent fraud and protect user data in defense of their business.\n\n\u201cIt is important for users to be aware of these risks and take steps to protect their personal information when using a crypto kiosk,\u201d Kemmerer added."

        "content": "Crypto became far less damaging to the environment in 2022 after Ethereum, the second biggest blockchain, lowered its carbon emissions by 99%. That puts a bigger spotlight on bitcoin, which is estimated to have emitted 86.3 million tons of carbon in 2022.\n\nNuclear power may be able to help. Cumulus Data has completed a data center connected to Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear power station, with plans to this year begin hosting the space for Bitcoin mining company TeraWulf. The center's completion, which was announced last week by Cumulus Data, sets it up to be the first nuclear-powered bitcoin mine in the US.\n\nIt means that any bitcoin mined through the center will emit next to no carbon.\n\nMining bitcoin requires enormous amounts of energy. Computers around the world race to solve complicated cryptographic puzzles, with the first to do so being rewarded with new bitcoin. The more computational power at your disposal, the greater your odds of solving the problem first. To be competitive, bitcoin miners setup warehouses filled with computer rigs dedicated to the process, guzzling vast sums of electricity.\n\nBecause renewable energy sources tend to be cheaper, bitcoin miners often setup their operation close to solar, wind or hydro farms. It's estimated that over 55% of bitcoin is mined using renewable energy, a point crypto proponents often make to argue that bitcoin is in fact good for the environment due to its encouragement of renewable energy. But bitcoin's emissions remain gargantuan, and nuclear energy is increasingly being seen as a way to reduce it.\n\nCumulus Data's arrangement is one of many. Oklo is an energy startup that plans to build a small nuclear plant; it's signed a 20-year deal with bitcoin-mining firm Compass Mining. Miami's pro-crypto mayor has tried to attract bitcoin miners from China by offering up the city's ample nuclear power.\n\nThe system by which bitcoin is mined, via computers competing to solve a puzzle, is called \"proof of work.\" Its purpose is to make bitcoin unhackable: You'd need to control over 51% of the computational power in bitcoin's network to overwhelm the system. Last year, Ethereum switched from proof of work to a system called \"proof of stake\" in which people deposit ether into the network for a chance to be chosen to \"verify\" transactions, for which they're rewarded with ether tokens.\n\nIn essence, proof of work has people expending electricity in order to earn bitcoin, proof of stake has people deposit money in the system. As a result of the switch, Ethereum's carbon footprint has shrunk by over 99%. There is no significant proposal for bitcoin to make the same switch."

        "content": "First opened in 1937, the coal-fired power plant outside the village of Dresden in the Finger Lakes region is one of many upstate power plants decommissioned in recent decades due to inefficiency and excessive greenhouse gas emissions. But the plant received a new lease on life in 2014, when Atlas Holdings acquired it and retrofitted it to burn natural gas rather than coal.\n\nGreenidge Generation, a subsidiary of Atlas Holdings, applied to the state Department of Environmental Conservation for a Title V air permit that would enable them to restart electricity generation. In that application, Greenidge said the plant would only operate part time, providing wholesale electricity to the state\u2019s power grid at times of peak demand. Greenidge\u2019s air permit was issued in 2016, with renewal scheduled for September 2021.\n\nThe Dresden plant restarted operations in 2017. At first, it only operated when demand on the grid and the price of electricity were especially high.\n\n\u201cIt was serving the grid and providing electricity solely to the grid,\u201d said Mandy DeRoche, deputy managing attorney in the Clean Energy Program at Earthjustice, which represents environmental groups opposed to Greenidge. \u201cSo we can see from the emissions profile and the days of operation, hours of operation, that they came online only a couple days a year. Each of those years, they correspond with heat waves and cold snaps.\u201d\n\nBut Greenidge soon discovered a way to monetize its electricity generation all year long.\n\nA lucrative opportunity\n\nIn the years after the Dresden plant restarted its operations, an increasing number of cryptocurrency mining companies set up operations in upstate New York, lured by relatively cheap electricity prices. Greenidge realized that it had access to a particularly cheap source of energy, since it owned its own power plant, and began investing in bitcoin mining.\n\nStarting in 2020, Greenidge began operating the Dresden plant nearly full time, using most of the power generated to power its own bitcoin mining rigs rather than selling it to the grid.\n\n\u201cAs both the cryptocurrency markets and the power markets are constantly fluctuating, we do whichever is more profitable at any given time \u2013 either sell the generated power or mine crypto with that power,\u201d Greenidge Chief Financial Officer Tim Rainey told Forbes in 2020.\n\nAs it became a leading company in the cryptocurrency mining space, Greenidge went public on the Nasdaq stock exchange through a reverse merger and took out large loans to finance the purchase of more mining rigs and a second power plant/crypto mining facility in South Carolina.\n\nEmissions create a downside\n\nAs the Dresden plant was now running around the clock, its total greenhouse gas emissions spiked \u2013 jumping from about 40,000 tons of carbon dioxide in 2019 to more than 200,000 tons in 2020.\n\nEnvironmental advocates protested, arguing that the state Department of Environmental Conservation had only authorized the operation of a part-time power plant, not a full-time cryptocurrency mining facility.\n\nThe department ultimately rejected this argument. But the agency was more receptive to advocates\u2019 claim that Greenidge\u2019s operation of the Dresden plant could violate the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, a landmark climate law that the state enacted in 2019.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big change between the 2016 permit and the 2021 application for the renewal is that groundbreaking climate law passed that does not allow for emissions increases to interfere or be inconsistent with the emissions reductions in New York state,\u201d DeRoche said.\n\nAfter a monthslong public comment hearing and repeated delays, the department\u2019s Division of Environmental Permits denied Greenidge\u2019s air permit renewal on June 30, 2022.\n\n\u201cBased on the information in the Application as prepared and submitted by Greenidge, as well as public comments and other relevant information, the Department hereby determines that the Facility\u2019s continued operation in its current manner would be inconsistent with or would interfere with the attainment of the Statewide GHG emission limits,\u201d the agency wrote in a letter explaining its decision.\n\nUncertain fate\n\nGreenidge immediately appealed the decision, and it is currently being reviewed by an administrative law judge. If the judge upholds the state Department of Environmental Conservation\u2019s denial of the permit, then Greenidge would likely appeal the decision in state court. Until Greenidge exhausts all of its appeals \u2013 which could take a year or more \u2013 the Dresden plant will be allowed to continue using the expired air permit.\n\nBut it\u2019s possible mining operations at the Dresden plant could grind to a halt well before that. Like other crypto mining companies, Greenidge has been hit hard by the collapse in bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nOn Dec. 20, the company agreed to sell most of its mining hardware to NYDIG, a creditor to whom it owes $74 million, and warned investors that it may soon have to file for voluntary bankruptcy protection. Greenidge did not respond to a request for comment on this article.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock, worth roughly $15 per share in early 2022, is now worth less than $1 per share, putting it at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq."

        "title": "Crypto miners seek financial lifeline with intense battle for bitcoins - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nCryptocurrency miners are turning their machines back on as the rallying price of bitcoin offers a vital lifeline to their cash-strapped businesses.\n\nThe value of the token has emerged from the doldrums to soar by more than a quarter this year against the dollar, incentivising the owners of huge warehouses of servers for mining to accelerate their use in the battle to secure more bitcoins.\n\nThe average hashrate, or the computing power directed towards mining bitcoin, rose to a record 280 exahash \u2014 or quintillion \u2014 operations per second on January 20, according to data from Hashrate Index, a mining information service.\n\nThe upsurge in activity is a sign that the battered sector may be crawling back to life after being buffeted by high energy costs and the slumping price of the cryptocurrency. The activity level has more than doubled from a low point in July, when the crypto market was hit by a credit crisis.\n\nMiners race each other to solve cryptographic puzzles that validate batches of transactions and create new blocks in the blockchain, a ledger of deals. That makes them the guarantors that bitcoin deals are trustworthy in a system that bypasses third parties such as banks and exchanges. The winner is rewarded with new coins.\n\nMany are sat on large quantities of mining equipment and capacity, bought with cheap money in 2021 and early 2022 in anticipation of turning a profit from the rising price of coins. But bitcoin prices slumped 65 per cent last year and energy prices soared, forcing many companies to switch off servers to save money. Others, such as Core Scientific, could not withstand the pressure and filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cThe sentiment among miners is better than in a long time,\u201d said Jaran Mellerud, an analyst at Hashrate Index. \u201cFor many bankruptcy threatened players, the sudden increase in the bitcoin price is a lifeline.\u201d\n\nThe rebound has underpinned investor optimism in listed companies like Marathon Digital Holdings, which has soared 155 per cent this year, and Hut 8, which has climbed 134 per cent.\n\nBut miners still face a long haul back from the brink. Turning on their servers is expensive. An algorithm adjusts the \u201cdifficulty level\u201d of mining bitcoin when new computers enter or exit the network, to ensure that the token is mined at its regular interval of roughly every 10 minutes.\n\nThe influx of miners has raised that level. It now takes miners a record 37tn hashes or guesses before verifying a block, according to BTC.com, so the losers expend ever-larger quantities of energy for nothing.\n\nThey are also facing a squeeze from politicians around the world, who see the miners\u2019 computers sucking up large amounts of power, draining local resources or damaging the environment. Others see the profits they make as a taxable asset.\n\nThe Canadian provinces British Columbia and Manitoba have barred new connections to their grids for 18 months, while Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, Quebec\u2019s public utility provider, has filed a request to reallocate 270 megawatts of power it had set aside for the mining industry.\n\nIn December, the lower house of Kazakhstan, host of the world\u2019s third largest share of mining activity, approved a bill that will impose a corporate tax on miners and curtail their energy usage.\n\n\n\nParaguay, which has an abundance of cheap hydroelectric power, rejected legislation that would have capped the tariffs imposed on miners to 15 per cent.\n\n\u201cMiners are becoming very selective about where they build out their infrastructure,\u201d said Joe Burnett, an analyst at mining advisory firm Blockware Solutions. \u201cA few years ago people were really just focused on cheap power but now it\u2019s become a lot more critical to look at which political jurisdiction is more favourable and isn\u2019t going to shut down our operations.\u201d\n\nMiners say they have become an unfair target. The Bitcoin Mining Council, an industry group, estimated in July that just under 60 per cent of global mining energy use was sustainable, although the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance puts the figure at about 37 per cent.\n\n\u201cThere is a fake environmental argument being waged against the mining industry,\u201d said Samir Tabar, chief strategist at Bit Digital, a mining company with operations in New York, Texas, Nebraska and Georgia. \u201cIt seems that no matter what bitcoin miners do, even if we use 100 per cent renewables, nothing is OK.\u201d\n\nErcot, the organisation that operates Texas\u2019s power grid, will launch a voluntary curtailment programme for large energy consumers like bitcoin miners to reduce their power use during high demand periods, until it develops a permanent regime to deal with shortages.\n\nBut that pinch point may provide an unexpected opportunity. Miners with power purchase agreements, which lock in the price they pay for energy, are able to sell power back to the grid. Riot and Hive Blockchain have earned $4.9mn and $3.1mn respectively in December.\n\n\u201cCurtailment is the future of mining,\u201d said Burnett. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t make financial sense to mine, you might as well sell [energy] back to somebody.\u201d"

        "title": "Is crypto dead in New York? - City & State New York",
        "content": "Early last year, the cryptocurrency industry was still flying high. A single bitcoin was worth about $40,000, major cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase, FTX and Crypto.com ran ads during the 2022 Super Bowl featuring major celebrities encouraging viewers to invest in crypto. New York City\u2019s newly elected mayor took his first three paychecks in bitcoin and talked up the industry at every opportunity. And cryptocurrency mining companies lured by cheap electricity prices upstate were flocking to New York.\n\nA year later, things look very different. Bitcoin is worth about $20,000, and the mayor has mostly stopped talking about it. FTX filed for bankruptcy, and its charismatic founder (and major political donor) Sam Bankman-Fried is under federal indictment for allegedly defrauding customers. And the state Legislature has passed a new law limiting the ability of cryptocurrency mining companies to take over upstate power plants.\n\nThe future of the cryptocurrency industry in New York has never been less certain. But to figure out where the industry is going, we first have to understand how it got here.\n\nMining moratorium\n\nBy design, mining cryptocurrencies like bitcoin require an astronomical amount of computing power and consume large amounts of electricity. The high electricity consumption is not just a side effect of bitcoin\u2019s protocol; it is the very source of bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nBitcoin relies on a \u201cproof-of-work\u201d mining system, which means that new bitcoins are awarded to computers known as \u201cminers\u201d that solve impossible mathematical equations. The only way for the computer to solve them is through random guesses. When a miner does happen to randomly stumble upon the correct solution, they receive a small amount of bitcoin as a reward.\n\nFor some time after bitcoin was initially introduced in 2009, it was possible for ordinary users to mine bitcoin using their home computers. But the equations have gotten increasingly difficult over the years, and it now requires entire data centers full of mining hardware to have any real shot at successfully mining bitcoin. Now, bitcoin mining is largely the domain of professional cryptocurrency mining companies, which raise millions of dollars to finance the construction of large data centers and to purchase the large quantities of electricity needed to power their mining rigs.\n\nThe increasing consolidation of bitcoin mining, and the industry\u2019s expanding need for more electricity, has led to a curious trend \u2013 cryptocurrency companies have started buying their own power plants.\n\nThe trend started with Greenidge Generation, which in 2020 turned an unprofitable upstate natural gas plant into a dedicated mining facility.\n\nMore recently, the Canadian cryptocurrency mining company Digihost acquired a natural gas plant near Buffalo, and it has plans to turn it into a dedicated bitcoin mining facility. Environmental groups have sued the state Public Service Commission, which must approve the transfer of any power plant, to try to block the sale.\n\nIn an attempt to prevent more bitcoin mining companies from taking over fossil fuel-based power plants, Assembly Member Anna Kelles sponsored a proof-of-work bitcoin mining moratorium bill that was signed into law last year. The bill will prohibit the state Department of Environmental Conservation from granting or renewing the Title V air permits of fossil fuel-based power plants that engage in proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining for two years.\n\nSince power plants cannot legally operate without valid Title V air permits, this will eventually prevent fossil fuel-based power plants from engaging in crypto mining when their current permits expire. Neither Greenidge nor Digihost will be affected by the moratorium, since they already have the necessary air permits, but the bill will prevent any more plants from pivoting to crypto \u2013 at least for the next two years.\n\nThe moratorium only applies to cryptocurrency mining companies that own fossil fuel power plants; miners that just buy their electricity from the grid or own hydropower plants will not be affected.\n\nIn addition to imposing the limited moratorium, the law requires the department to produce a full environmental impact statement detailing the effects of cryptocurrency mining on New York\u2019s environmental goals.\n\nKelles told City & State that it was necessary to implement a limited moratorium as soon as possible because there are currently 49 decommissioned fossil fuel power plants in New York state that could easily be purchased and brought back online by crypto mining companies.\n\nThe crypto industry opposed Kelles\u2019 bill, instead advancing a competing bill co-sponsored by Assembly Member Clyde Vanel.\n\nVanel, the chair of the Assembly Internet and New Technology Subcommittee, is a strong supporter of the cryptocurrency industry who personally owns 10 different types of cryptocurrency and has introduced multiple bills related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. Last year, he co-sponsored a bill to create a Cryptocurrency & Blockchain Task Force. The task force \u2013 which would have included a diverse group of stakeholders, including academics, industry representatives, investors, regulators and policymakers \u2013 would have studied the issue and then eventually issued a report.\n\nAlthough both the Kelles and Vanel bills ultimately passed the Legislature, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed Kelles\u2019 bill into law and vetoed Vanel\u2019s bill. Vanel told City & State that he was considering reintroducing the task force study bill in the current legislative session.\n\nThe politics of regulation\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry has long decried the state\u2019s regulations, mostly because New York is one of the few states that actually does attempt to regulate the industry.\n\nIn 2015, the state Department of Financial Services issued new regulations requiring anyone engaged in \u201cvirtual currency business activity\u201d to apply for and receive a special state license. This virtual currency license, known as a \u201cBitLicense,\u201d can be difficult to obtain. Over the past eight years, only 22 entities have received a BitLicense.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry has repeatedly criticized this virtual licensing regime. In 2021, for example, the cryptocurrency news site CoinDesk published an op-ed titled, \u201cKill the BitLicense,\u201d which argued that the BitLicense had prevented innovative cryptocurrency startups from flourishing in New York.\n\nIndustry-friendly politicians also advocated for reforming the BitLicense system.\n\n\u201cThe New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) has the dubious distinction of being the single worst regulator of crypto in the country,\u201d Rep. Ritchie Torres declared last year in a Daily News op-ed titled \u201cA liberal case for cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s regulatory regime has the cost of inhibiting job creation and innovation without the actual benefit of protecting a single consumer or investor,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic case of bureaucracy trumping efficacy.\u201d\n\nAt the time it was published in March, bitcoin was worth more than $40,000 and the industry seemed on the cusp of mainstream legitimacy and real political power.\n\nNew York City had just elected Mayor Eric Adams, a proud bitcoin fan. One of the mayor-elect\u2019s first moves was to hitch a ride to Puerto Rico on the private jet of Brock Pierce, a child actor turned crypto billionaire. Adams also converted his first three mayoral paychecks to bitcoin and promised to make New York a crypto hub, which among other things involved touting the creation of a worthless new cryptocurrency called \u201cNYCCoin.\u201d\n\nPierce wasn\u2019t the only crypto billionaire seeking to influence politics. Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old founder of Bahamas-based crypto exchange FTX, established himself as a major political donor and philanthropist by donating tens of millions of dollars to political candidates across the country. In 2022, he was the second-largest donor to Democratic Party candidates, and recipients of his donations included U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Rep. Gregory Meeks and Torres. (The Intercept reported that Bankman-Fried also hosted a fundraiser for Torres, but the representative denied it.)\n\nBankman-Fried claimed publicly that he was donating to candidates who shared his passion for preventing the next pandemic, though many recipients of his largesse also happened to sit on powerful committees that could influence the federal government\u2019s approach to cryptocurrency regulation.\n\nIn particular, Bankman-Fried advocated for the passage of a bill, co-sponsored by Gillibrand, that would have classified cryptocurrencies as commodities instead of securities. This would have ensured that cryptocurrencies were not subject to the very strict regulations placed on investment securities and the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s enforcement of those regulations. Instead, the crypto industry would be regulated by the comparatively more friendly Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The legislation would also have moved congressional oversight of the industry from the House and Senate financial services committees to the chambers\u2019 respective agriculture committees.\n\nTorres, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, told City & State that he did not support Gillibrand\u2019s bill, since it would have taken power away from his committee.\n\nAsked whether cryptocurrencies should be regulated as securities or commodities, he said that there was no one-size-fits-all solution.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a crypto asset that resembles a security, it should be subject to SEC regulation, and if it resembles a commodity, it should be subject to CFTC regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the digital asset is a stablecoin, it should be subject to the Federal Reserve, which regulates our national currency. So the nature of the digital asset ought to determine the nature of the regulation.\u201d\n\nBankruptcies and lawsuits\n\nIn the past year, numerous cryptocurrency exchanges and lending companies have declared bankruptcy, and hundreds of thousands of customers who invested in these companies have lost access to their funds.\n\nThe trouble started in May, when the stablecoin Terra \u2013 which was never supposed to be worth less than $1 \u2013 declined in price. Companies that owned Terra lost money, which meant they could no longer afford to pay back their loans, which meant that their creditors lost money, and so on. As the contagion spread throughout the industry, a number of cryptocurrency firms \u2013 including Three Arrows Capital, Celsius, Voyager and BlockFi \u2013 filed for bankruptcy.\n\nBankman-Fried and FTX attempted to acquire BlockFi and Voyager to protect their customers from losing their money. But in November, it was revealed that FTX had also lost many of its customers\u2019 deposits. FTX declared bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried was soon arrested, extradited to the United States and indicted on federal charges related to securities fraud, commodities fraud and campaign finance violations. The price of bitcoin sank below $20,000.\n\nCompared to citizens of other states, New Yorkers were relatively protected from the cryptocurrency downturn \u2013 since many of the crypto companies that have lost customers\u2019 deposits were never allowed to operate in the state in the first place.\n\n\u201cNew Yorkers for the most part have been insulated and protected from the downfall of Voyager, of Celsius, of FTX.\u201d Vanel said. \u201cOne of our agencies, DFS, came out with something called the BitLicense. It was enacted and put in place in 2015. And since then, no New Yorker that abided by the rules has gotten caught in Celsius, Voyager, FTX.\u201d\n\nThese days, even Torres seems supportive of the BitLicense, albeit with tweaks.\n\n\u201cI have one criticism of New York state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes too long to get a BitLicense. It should not take three years. But having said that, New York is regulating crypto more effectively than the federal government. If the SEC or the CFTC had had the same kind of framework that DFS adopted back in 2015, then a scandal like FTX could have been prevented.\u201d\n\nNeither the state Department of Financial Services nor state Attorney General Letitia James have been shy about going after cryptocurrency companies that have failed to follow the state\u2019s regulations.\n\nIn February 2021, the state attorney general reached an $18.5 million settlement with the stablecoin Tether and its affiliated cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which required both companies to stop operating in the state. The company was cagey about disclosing proof of its cash reserves and its murky relationship with sister company Bitfinex, and the state attorney general\u2019s office accused it of hiding $850 million in losses.\n\nLater that year, James sued Coinseed for allegedly defrauding customers and forced the company to shut down.\n\nIn June 2022, the state attorney general secured a $1 million settlement with BlockFi for offering unregistered securities.\n\nThis month, James filed a lawsuit against former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky for allegedly defrauding investors. Even more lawsuits against cryptocurrency companies are expected in the coming months.\n\nThe Department of Financial Services, meanwhile, just reached a $100 million settlement with Coinbase for failing to comply with the state\u2019s anti-money laundering laws.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nAfter the major disruptions of the past year, the future of the cryptocurrency industry in New York is more uncertain than ever.\n\nThe signing of Kelles\u2019 bitcoin moratorium bill promises to reshape the upstate cryptocurrency mining landscape. Miners may have to embrace hydropower and other renewable energy sources to power their bitcoin mining operations. Another possibility is that the industry will increasingly abandon proof-of-work mining.\n\nWhile proof-of-work was the original method of mining cryptocurrency, alternatives do exist. A number of newer cryptocurrencies, including Solana, use an approach called \u201cproof-of-stake,\u201d which uses orders of magnitude less computing power and electricity. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, switched from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake last year.\n\n\u201cWe put all this emphasis on (proof-of-work) cryptocurrency mining, but it is the dinosaur,\u201d Kelles said. \u201cIt was the first one created, but if you are looking at newer technologies, they are very nimble, and that is where a lot of the innovation is happening.\u201d\n\nKelles said that she would like to see bitcoin switch to proof-of-stake, though she doubts that it ever will.\n\nTorres is also a fan of proof-of-stake: \u201cAll cryptocurrency should transition to sustainable alternatives to proof of work for the sake of combating climate change.\u201d\n\nOver the past eight years, New York state has proven that it is possible to comprehensively regulate the nascent crypto industry. But so far, the state\u2019s approach has not been replicated by other states or the federal government. Last year, California\u2019s governor vetoed a bill that would have introduced a virtual currency license modeled on New York\u2019s BitLicense.\n\nOn the federal level, cryptocurrency remains a largely unregulated sector, but it will not remain that way forever. And when Congress does finally take steps to seriously regulate the industry, it seems likely to look to New York\u2019s approach as a model to emulate.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is hopeful that the feds will take the right lesson from New York\u2019s experience.\n\n\u201cI would hope that the BitLicense is a ceiling rather than a floor for regulation,\u201d said John Olsen, the New York state lead for the Blockchain Association. \u201cIn some respects, it\u2019s worked very well, but enshrining in the country standards of that magnitude, I think, would force a lot of companies to rethink domiciling in the United States simply because of the costs required to actually operate legally.\u201d"

        "title": "Congo's Oldest National Park Bets on Bitcoin - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nIn Congo\u2019s Virunga National Park, compounding issues from the pandemic and violent conflict have had a dramatic impact on tourism, leading park administrators to turn toward green-energy-based Bitcoin mining.\n\nVirunga National Park has had a storied history since its founding in 1925. The oldest national park in The Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is arguably one of the oldest in Africa, especially considering that older parks were established with titles like \u201cGame Preserve No. 3.\u201d Having once been the largest park in the Congo, it sits on the border with two other countries, and has since split between them. The largest piece, however, remains in the Congo, where it is home to thousands of endangered species, including a gorilla that only exists in the park. And it is in trouble.\n\nA series of significant problems has led to park authorities\u2019 decision to begin bitcoin mining in the national park. The park\u2019s status on the border between three nations has engulfed it in various humanitarian crises, like the Congo Wars and the Rwandan Genocide. Although refugees can certainly disrupt endangered habitats, the real danger has come from the fighters. Armed militias from these conflicts can come to poach timber and animals, extract oil, even set up permanent bases and more. And while these threats are bad enough to discourage visitation, the global COVID-19 pandemic further hurt tourism revenues, wiping out 40% of park revenue.\n\nIt is for these reasons that park director Emmanuel de Merode has pursued a radical solution: using park facilities to mine Bitcoin. Three hydroelectric dams exist within the park, which can readily convert excess electricity into bitcoin with zero carbon emissions. The operation began in late 2020, and now includes thousands of mining rigs. Some 70% are owned by Big Block Green Services, which has partnered with the park and purchases electricity, while the other 30% are owned directly by the park itself. De Merode seemed unconcerned about market fluctuation, claiming that, \u201cWe\u2019re not speculating on its value; we\u2019re generating it. If you buy bitcoin and it decreases, you lose money. We\u2019re making bitcoin out of surplus energy and monetizing something that otherwise has no value. That\u2019s a big difference.\u201d\n\nThis radical solution is right at home in a climate of growing Bitcoin adoption in Africa. As international Bitcoin conferences take off, major developers worldwide are already planning to build the infrastructure that can meet growing demand. Virunga turning to decentralized cryptocurrency is just another example of how well Bitcoin can penetrate into new markets, and how its use-cases beyond pure speculation to power a strong community. Although Virunga National Park is facing real dangers near its 100-year anniversary, Bitcoin can show it a bright future for 100 more.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "JONESBOROUGH, Tenn. (WJHL) \u2014 Washington County\u2019s lawsuit against utility BrightRidge and Bitcoin mine operator Red Dog Technologies will likely go to trial before this fall, the county attorney told county commissioners Monday night.\n\nCommissioners voted overwhelmingly Nov. 28 to reject a settlement proposal that would have allowed Red Dog to build a new Bitcoin mine at the Washington County Industrial Park to replace one in Limestone that started operating in late 2020.\n\nCommissioners sued BrightRidge in November 2021, claiming the mine didn\u2019t meet zoning requirements and that no permit for it had been granted. BrightRidge leases property to Red Dog next to its Bailey Bridge Road substation in the New Salem community and it was BrightRidge that initially applied for a rezoning to allow what it said would be a \u201cblockchain data center.\u201d\n\nGRIID Infrastructure, Red Dog\u2019s parent company, was the planned user of the space and a Bitcoin mine is a type of blockchain data center, but county commissioners were never told about a Bitcoin mine or a user other than BrightRidge when the utility applied for the rezoning in February 2020.\n\nThe lawsuit came months after residents near the mine complained of its noise in May 2021. The mine has continued to operate throughout the duration of the lawsuit.\n\nWilkinson talked at greater length with commissioners in a closed executive session Monday night. She did say in response to a question from Commissioner Richard Tucker that \u201cthe lawsuit that Washington County filed was never dismissed while settlement was under discussion.\u201d\n\nShe said the day after the county\u2019s 13-2 vote to reject the settlement proposal, her office contacted Washington County Chancery Court, where the suit is filed, \u201cto advise them that settlement was not an option under those terms.\u201d\n\nHer office explained some scheduling issues that defense attorneys had raised considering the coming holidays. As of Monday morning, no updates had been filed in the case, but Wilkinson said that was going to change soon.\n\n\u201cJust this week we have heard back from the court to discuss different trial dates,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cThat would be the next step.\u201d\n\nWilkinson said she has already discussed dates with Angie Charles, Washington County\u2019s planning director and the primary plaintiff in the case, about her schedule.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting to hear from all counsel that all of the parties are available,\u201d Wilkinson said. Plaintiff Washington County stands ready for trial as and when the court sets it, which I would expect to be before the fall.\u201d\n\nGRIID, meanwhile, has had a deadline extended for it to go public through a \u201cspecial purpose acquisition company\u201d (SPAC) called Adit EdTech. The SPAC\u2019s shareholders voted overwhelmingly to allow a six-month extension past a previous January deadline.\n\nA report by GRIID filed in early December as part of an Adit EdTech Securities and Exchange Commission filing reveals that GRIID had suffered net losses of almost $37 million through the first nine months of 2022, compared to a net profit of $5.1 million for the same period of 2021. GRIID has operating losses of $13.7 million in the first nine months of 2022, with most of the remainder of its net losses coming from interest expenses.\n\nIn 2021, GRIID had an operating profit of $14.6 million as Bitcoin prices were higher.\n\nThat report also revealed that GRIID\u2019s entire Bitcoin mining capacity is just 68 megawatts (MW). About 25 MW of that is at the Limestone site.\n\nIn addition to lower prices for Bitcoin, GRIID paid more for electricity in 2022.\n\nGRIID has had to borrow additional funds at very high interest rates in recent months. The company\u2019s interest expense in the first nine months of 2022 was $22.7 million, compared to just $2.6 million in the first nine months of 2021.\n\nThe company had to rework its lending agreement with Blockchain Access Limited in mid-2022. Rather than a line of credit with the company it now has a $57 million term loan."

        "title": "Could This Feature Make Bitcoin Go Parabolic in 2023? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "While 2022 was a down year for cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin (BTC 2.04%), the most valuable asset in the industry, losing 65%, things are taking a positive turn in 2023. As of Jan. 21, Bitcoin is up 36% so far on the year, and bullish supporters are hoping this is a microcosm of what's in store over the next 12 months.\n\nIt's really anyone's guess where Bitcoin's price goes next. But an exciting feature could carry this top cryptocurrency to new heights in 2023. Let's take a closer look.\n\nBuilding for speed and scalability\n\nSince its first verified transaction in January 2009 until now, Bitcoin has primarily only been used as a store of value. Bitcoin's defining characteristic, which is that there will only ever be 21 million coins created, makes many believe that as demand to own it increases over time, the fixed supply translates to a higher price. The comparison you've most likely heard is that Bitcoin is like a digital version of gold, a novel way to store wealth in a world that is only becoming more digital.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin was created with decentralization and security as non-negotiable traits. Not only are there thousands of miners across the world that help verify new transactions on the blockchain, but Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus mechanism makes it almost impossible for the network to be attacked. This is a great setup to have.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin's lack of scalability is an issue, as it can only process 3.5 transactions per second, according to bitinfocharts.com. In order for Bitcoin to evolve from a store of value to a medium of exchange, it needs to become faster at settling transactions.\n\nLuckily, a layer 2 solution, known as the lightning network, is in the works. The lightning network is built on top of the main Bitcoin blockchain, and it essentially creates channels between different parties who want to transact frequently with each other. For example, I might open a channel with my local coffee shop or gym. Any time I buy a cup of coffee or pay my monthly membership fee, balances are updated on the lightning network. These channels can be closed at any time, at which point the transaction is sent to the Bitcoin layer for final settlement.\n\nThe benefit of lightning is that it reduces the data load on the primary Bitcoin blockchain, as transactions are settled far less frequently. Lightning solves the problem of speed, scalability, and costs.\n\nA major fintech company like Block has already enabled free payments for its 49 million monthly Cash App users by connecting with the lightning network. Any additional news about the ongoing development and adoption of the lightning network should be closely followed in 2023, as this key feature's progress could catapult Bitcoin's price in short order.\n\nMacro factors matter\n\nBitcoin's price has skyrocketed quickly before. It was up 1,300% in 2017, 85% in 2019, 309% in 2020, and 1,120% in 2021, so it's not completely out of the question for it to go parabolic in 2023. With Bitcoin's price rising rapidly so far this year, \"hodlers\" are certainly hoping for the momentum to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever, it's hard to overstate how important macroeconomic factors are to the price action of risky assets, a category where Bitcoin firmly belongs. The Federal Reserve started adopting a policy of monetary tightening in March last year, actions taken to curb soaring inflation that took hold of the economy. Immediately, we saw growth tech stocks, as well as cryptocurrencies, plummet.\n\nI'm always skeptical of any explanations that so-called financial experts provide as to why a particular asset moved up or down in a short period of time. But I think Bitcoin's rally to start the year has something to do with inflation cooling down in recent months. And this has many hoping that the Fed will pause its rate hikes, or maybe even reverse course, sometime in 2023.\n\nAn accommodative central bank, a growing economy, and positive investor sentiment are critical ingredients for Bitcoin to continue its climb throughout the year. While progress with the lightning network is definitely something to keep an eye on, at least for now, Bitcoin's price is fully dependent on investor enthusiasm in the near term."

        "content": "2023 is off to a precarious start, with the market higher but a lot of uncertainty in the air about economic and market conditions moving forward.\n\nCrypto has begun to poke its head out with the price of Bitcoin (BTC 2.16%) rebounding nicely and recently topping $21,000 in hopes of cooling inflation and a weakening dollar. While I don't know what the future holds this year, if inflation keeps cooling and the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates, there is a chance for a more bullish year for the broader crypto market.\n\nIn a bull market and more of a risk-on environment, I see the potential for the popular meme token Shiba Inu (SHIB 1.88%) to beat Bitcoin in 2023. Here's why.\n\nA more volatile token\n\nBitcoin is the pioneer of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, which is a big reason it has become the world's largest and most trusted cryptocurrency. Altcoins like Shiba Inu tend to move with a high correlation to Bitcoin.\n\nBut as people and institutions all over the world have adopted Bitcoin and it's become more ingrained into the mainstream financial system, the price of Bitcoin has become more stable than the altcoin market, not that one would necessarily call Bitcoin stable in the grand scheme of things.\n\nWhile things can always change quickly in crypto, since the pandemic, when the price of Bitcoin falls, I expect altcoins to fall more and have more downside. But on the flip side, when Bitcoin rises, I would expect altcoins to swing higher, making the volatility both a pro and a con for many altcoins.\n\nArguably the most viral cryptocurrency\n\nFew altcoins have been more volatile or created more buzz than the meme token Shiba Inu, which now has over a $6.5 billion market cap.\n\nShiba Inu rose to prominence as a joke on Dogecoin (DOGE 1.13%), which started the meme token craze. Even in 2022, when the crypto market fell into a crypto winter, Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, reported that Shiba Inu was one of the three large most-watched cryptocurrencies in 2022, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH 1.38%).\n\nAnd this buzz has continued into 2023, with Shiba Inu ranking first on CoinMarketCap's trending list as recently as Jan. 9, so there is really no token better than going viral and generating buzz than Shiba Inu.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has also generated interest due to its soon-to-be-launched Shibarium layer 2 protocol, which \"provides the benefits of scalability, faster transaction times, lower fees, and an expanded development framework\" for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. This is the first time developers are attempting to really improve the technical capabilities of Shiba Inu, so it will be interesting to see how it plays out.\n\nHow Shiba Inu wins in 2023\n\nI'll clarify here that I still much prefer owning Bitcoin over Shiba Inu. I also think that Bitcoin's further stability is more evidence of its growing acceptance and long-term viability.\n\nBut I could see Shiba Inu outperforming Bitcoin this year under the right conditions. We'll really need more favorable buying conditions and more of a risk-on environment. That means more signs of cooling inflation and the Fed ending its rate-hiking campaign and potentially cutting rates later this year as well.\n\nI also think investors need to regain some confidence back in the industry, especially after the FTX bankruptcy and the contagion it has spread. But if crypto escapes the crypto winter and goes on a bull run, I would expect Shiba Inu to outperform Bitcoin due to its greater volatility and virality."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has an important new price target for bulls to meet \u2014 and it is closer than it seems.\n\nAs noted by Philip Swift, co-founder of trading suite Decentrader, $25,000 is now a critical BTC price level.\n\nBitcoin price rally near \"a lot of liquidity\"\n\nAfter putting in 40% gains in January, Bitcoin continues to consolidate around the $23,000.\n\nOpinions are split as to what will happen next \u2014 after more than a year of bear market, plenty of market participants expect a dramatic correction and even new multi-year lows of $12,000 or worse.\n\nOthers believe that the good times can continue and even see BTC/USD reach $30,000 before checking its relief rally.\n\nIn the meantime, however, some are focused on another line in the sand much closer to current spot price.\n\nFor Swift, the area around $25,000 is now especially significant. This, he noted in a tweet on Jan. 24, is where bears begin to get liquidated en masse.\n\nIt is also the site of Bitcoin\u2019s 200-week moving average (WMA), a key trend line which has been absent from the chart since the middle of 2022, when it failed to act as support. Bitcoin has since spent a record amount of time below the 200WMA, which currently sits at around $24,750.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of liquidity from $24,700 - $25,900 which lines up with the 200WMA and the area just above it,\u201d Swift commented.\n\nBTC/USD liquidity chart (screenshot). Source: Decentrader\n\nAnalysis of an accompanying liquidity chart shows that leveraged short positions will start seeing liquidations once BTC/USD passes $23,400 \u2014 so far, this is exactly where the rally has encountered momentum problems.\n\n\u201cThis level continues to act as resistance,\u201d trader and analyst Rekt Capital wrote in part of commentary about the topic, noting that Bitcoin\u2019s latest weekly close was also lower.\n\n\u201cBTC needs to reclaim this ~$23400 as support to move higher, otherwise there is a risk of a new Lower High forming relative to the Summer 2022 highs.\u201d\n\nSuch a scenario would mean BTC/USD fails to crack its local highs from August, these in themselves marking brief respite in the 77% drawdown from the all-time highs seen in November 2021.\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: Rekt Capital/ Twitter\n\nAugust 2022 highs keep bulls in check\n\nContinuing, Rekt Capital drew attention to the fact that the summer highs also present a resistance zone on longer timeframes.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price stays near $23K as data shows hodlers not selling BTC\n\nAnalyzing the monthly chart in his latest YouTube update, he underscored the need to break through that resistance, which is still \"reaffirming itself.\"\n\n\"If this continues to be the case, then we could set ourselves up for a dip just to reaffirm this level as support,\" he argued, referring to the monthly range lows, which Bitcoin lost thanks to the FTX debacle.\n\nA short-term prediction suggested that \"some consolidation could take place for as long as it needs to take place before there is a break to either side of the range.\"\n\nA trip below the range low, Rekt Capital added, was nonetheless not out of the question.\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart.

        "content": "Disclaimer: This article has been updated for clarity regarding the veracity of certain claims to the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym used by the creator(s) of Bitcoin, whose true identity remains unknown. The name was used to author the original Bitcoin (BTC) white paper in 2008 and to create and deploy the first Bitcoin software in 2009. Nakamoto\u2019s true identity has never been revealed, and they have remained an enigma in the world of cryptocurrency. They are estimated to have mined around 1 million BTC in the early days of the network, which would make them one of the wealthiest people in the world.\n\nSome believe that Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym for an individual, while others maintain that it could be a group of people.\n\nMany have been nominated as possible inventors while others have made the claim that they themselves are the inventor of Bitcoin. Below is a list of just a handful of such individuals. Newcomers to the crypto industry should note that these claims are highly disputed and that no official conclusion has been reached regarding the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nNick Szabo\n\nNick Szabo is a computer scientist, legal scholar and cryptographer known for his research on digital contracts and digital currency. He is credited with developing the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written into the code. Szabo first proposed the idea of smart contracts in 1994 in an article titled \"Smart Contracts: Building Blocks for Digital Markets.\u201d\n\nSzabo is also known for his work on digital currency and cryptography and is considered a pioneer in digital money. He created a precursor to Bitcoin called \u201cBit Gold,\u201d which he described in a series of blog posts in the late 1990s.\n\nSzabo speaking at an event. Source: The U.S. Sun\n\nSzabo is considered by many to be a likely candidate for the true identity of Nakamoto, but he has denied it.\n\nHe is also a legal scholar and has written extensively on the legal implications of digital contracts and digital currency. He is an advocate of digital freedom and privacy and has written on the intersection of cryptography and civil liberties.\n\nHal Finney\n\nHal Finney was a computer programmer and early Bitcoin contributor. He was one of the first people to run the Bitcoin software and was an active member of the community in the years following its creation. Finney was also a developer of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption software, which is widely used to secure email communications.\n\nHal Finney and his wife Fran Finney. Source: Braiins\n\nHe was a well-known figure in the Bitcoin community and was recognized for his contributions to its development. He was also a vocal advocate for Bitcoin and wrote extensively on the technology\u2019s potential in various forums and social media platforms.\n\nFinney denied the claims that he created Bitcoin but acknowledged having received the first Bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto. He passed away in 2014 due to complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative disease of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscle movement. He was widely respected and honored within the Bitcoin community.\n\nDorian Nakamoto\n\nDorian Nakamoto is a retired Japanese-American engineer and physicist whose name was put forward as a potential Satoshi Nakamoto in a 2014 article by Leah McGrath Goodman in the magazine Newsweek.\n\nDorian Nakamoto denied the allegations, stating that he had never heard of Bitcoin before the article was published and that he had no involvement in creating the cryptocurrency. He also said he was not fluent in English and felt that the interviewer had taken his statements out of context.\n\nNakamoto thanks the Bitcoin community in a YouTube video. Source: Dara Kerr/CNET\n\nDespite his denial, the article sparked a media frenzy, with journalists and members of the public staking out Dorian Nakamoto\u2019s home and attempting to contact him for interviews. The attention caused a great deal of stress for him and his family, and he later sought legal advice to deal with the situation. Dorian Nakamoto\u2019s name was later removed from the list of potential candidates. He has been a private person since then, and not much is known about him or his activities.\n\nCraig Wright\n\nCraig Wright is an Australian computer scientist and businessman who has publicly claimed to be Nakamoto. Wright first made the claims in 2016 and later provided some technical information that according to him provided evidence to support them.\n\nWright has been a controversial figure in the cryptocurrency community, and his claims to be Nakamoto have been met with great skepticism. Many experts in the field have stated that the evidence presented by Wright is insufficient to prove his claim, and some have accused him of fraud.\n\nThree videos from the September trial in Oslo. Kinda sums it up. pic.twitter.com/diBfHNB3HD \u2014 hodlonaut 13%er \u26a1 (@hodlonaut) January 24, 2023\n\nWright is also known for his involvement in various lawsuits and legal disputes, including a multibillion-dollar lawsuit against the estate of Dave Kleiman, a computer scientist and cybersecurity expert who was also considered a potential candidate for Nakamoto, and several conflicts with other members of the cryptocurrency community.\n\nAdam Back\n\nAdam Back is a British computer scientist and cryptography expert who has been involved in developing various blockchain and digital currency projects. He is best known as the creator of Hashcash, a proof-of-work system used to prevent spam and denial-of-service attacks, which was proposed in 1997 and later served as an inspiration for Bitcoin\u2019s mining mechanism.\n\nAdam Back. Source: Blockstream\n\nBack is a respected figure in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry and has been involved in various projects and companies. He is also an active member of the cypherpunk community, a group of activists and technologists who advocate for using cryptography to protect privacy and civil liberties.\n\nBack has denied being Nakamoto but remains a vocal advocate for privacy and has spoken out against government surveillance and the erosion of civil liberties. He is also known for his research on distributed systems, writing several papers and articles on the subject.\n\nWei Dai\n\nWei Dai is a computer scientist and cryptographer known for his contributions to the development of digital currency. He is best known for his work on digital cash and electronic payment systems and is considered one of the field\u2019s pioneers.\n\nDai\u2019s most notable contribution is the creation of B-money, an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system proposed in 1998. The concept of B-money served as an inspiration for the development of Bitcoin, and many of the ideas presented in Dai\u2019s B-money paper were later incorporated into the Bitcoin white paper.\n\nDai has denied being Nakamoto. He remains a member of the cypherpunk community.\n\nVili Lehdonvirta\n\nVili Lehdonvirta is a Finnish economist and researcher on digital culture and economies. He is a senior research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute of the University of Oxford, where he researches digital labor, platform economies and digital currencies. Lehdonvirta has published several papers and articles on digital currencies and online marketplaces and has been a speaker at various conferences and events on the topic.\n\nProfessor Vili Lehdonvirta. Source: Oxford Internet Institute\n\nLehdonvirta\u2019s name has been suggested as a potential Nakamoto due to his early research on digital currencies and online marketplaces. However, there is no concrete evidence linking him to the creation of Bitcoin, and Lehdonvirta himself has denied being Nakamoto. He has also been involved in various policy-making processes and has provided expert testimony on digital economy-related issues to governments and international organizations.\n\nAs noted above, these are only a small number of individuals who have claimed or been nominated as the true face behind the inventor of Bitcoin. As the crypto industry continues to develop and grow, there will likely be more theories, and it is possible that the world may never know for certain who is the real Satoshi Nakamoto."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) rallied 11% between Jan. 20 and Jan. 21, reaching the $23,000 level and shattering bears' expectations for a pullback to $20,000. Even more notable is the move brought demand from Asia-based retail investors, according to data from a key stablecoin premium indicator.\n\nTraders should note that the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index also gained 5.1% between Jan. 20 and Jan. 23, fueled by investors\u2019 hope in China reopening for business after its COVID-19 lockdowns and weaker-than-expected economic data in the U.S. and the Eurozone.\n\nAnother bit of bullish information came on Jan. 20 after U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller reinforced the market expectation of a 25 basis point interest rate increase in February. A handful of heavyweight companies are expected to report their latest quarterly earnings this week to complete the puzzle, including Microsoft, IBM, Visa, Tesla and Mastercard.\n\nIn essence, the central bank is aiming for a \u201csoft landing,\u201c or a controlled decline of the economy, with fewer job openings and less inflation. However, if companies struggle with their balance sheets due to the increased cost of capital, earnings tend to nosedive and ultimately layoffs will be much higher than anticipated.\n\nOn Jan. 23, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode pointed out that long-term Bitcoin investors held losing positions for over a year, so those are likely more resilient to future adverse price movements.\n\nLet's look at derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nThe Asia-based stablecoin premium nears the FOMO area\n\nThe USD Coin (USDC) premium is a good gauge of China-based crypto retail trader demand. It measures the difference between China-based peer-to-peer trades and the United States dollar.\n\nExcessive buying demand tends to pressure the indicator above fair value at 103%, and during bearish markets, the stablecoin\u2019s market offer is flooded, causing a 4% or higher discount.\n\nUSDC peer-to-peer vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKX\n\nCurrently, the USDC premium stands at 103.5%, up from 98.7% on Jan. 19, signaling higher demand for stablecoin buying from Asian investors. The movement coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s 11% daily gain on Jan. 20 and indicates moderate FOMO by retail traders as BTC price approached $23,000.\n\nPro traders are not particularly excited after the recent gain\n\nThe long-to-short metric excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the stablecoin market. It also gathers data from exchange clients\u2019 positions on the spot, perpetual and quarterly futures contracts, thus offering better information on how professional traders are positioned.\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nExchanges' top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe first trend one can spot is Huobi and Binance\u2019s top traders being extremely skeptical of the recent rally. Those whales and market makers did not change their long-to-short levels over the last week, meaning they are not confident about buying above $20,500, but they are unwilling to open short (bear) positions.\n\nInterestingly, top traders at OKX reduced their net longs (bull) until Jan. 20 but drastically changed their positions during the latest phase of the bull run. Looking at a longer, three-week time frame, their current 1.05 long-to-short ratio remains lower than the 1.18 seen on Jan. 7.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners\u2019 worst days may have passed, but a few key hurdles remain\n\nBears are shy, providing an excellent opportunity for bull runs\n\nThe 3.5% stablecoin premium in Asia indicates a higher appetite from retail traders. Additionally, the top traders\u2019 long-to-short indicator shows no demand increase from shorts even as Bitcoin reached its highest level since August.\n\nFurthermore, the $335 million liquidation in short (bear) BTC futures contracts between Jan. 19 and Jan. 20 signals that sellers continue to use excessive leverage, setting up the perfect storm for another leg of the bull run.\n\nUnfortunately, Bitcoin price continues to be heavily dependent on the performance of stock markets. Considering how resilient BTC has been during the uncertainties regarding the bankruptcy of Digital Currency Group\u2019s Genesis Capital, the odds favor a rally toward $24,000 or $25,000.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s mining industry has been relatively stable compared to the bearish price action and the tumultuous fallout of exchanges and lending companies.\n\nThe network\u2019s hash rate dipped slightly toward the end of 2022, primarily due to an unprecedented blizzard in the U.S., and has since recovered strongly to surpass its previous peak above 270 EH/s. It was particularly encouraging to see that the hash rate was holding well above summer 2022 lows, despite the aftermath of the FTX collapse.\n\nBitcoin 7-day average hash rate. Source: Glassnode\n\nHowever, despite the recent robustness in a variety of metrics, the mining industry faces many challenges that will likely restrict its growth moving forward. The hurdles include low profitability, a threat from a new generation of efficient machines and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which will slash block rewards by half.\n\nBTC mining remains a stressed industry\n\nWhile the hash rate of Bitcoin's network has improved, miners are still under a lot of stress due to low profitability. The earnings of Bitcoin miners have shrunk to one-third of their value from the peak. Before the May 2022 price collapse, miners made more than $0.22 daily per TH/s, a figure which has now dropped to $0.07.\n\nThe percentage share of small-sized miners with breakeven prices above $25,000 has dropped from 80% in 2019 to 2% by 2022, which is a positive sign of an end to miner capitulation.\n\nThe sustainability of mid-sized miners with breakeven prices between $20,000 and $25,000 depends on the capital efficiency of participants. The struggle for them is to survive until the bullish trend commences, hoping to benefit from the next bullish cycle.\n\nThe significant drop in prices of mid-sized machines suggests that their demand has slowed down. According to CoinShares, reducing machine prices will allow capital-rich entities to \u201creduce their capital expense cost per TH/s and increase output without incurring additional ongoing cash-costs\u201d by buying hardware at a cheap rate. However, this will come at the expense of existing miners, which will likely restrict the industry's growth as a whole.\n\nAverage price of Bitcoin ASIC mining machines. Source: Hashrate Index\n\nMoreover, the firms with weak financials will also not be able to take advantage of the slowdown by raising debt, especially as central banks are hiking borrowing interest rates globally.\n\nIndependent research firm The Bitcoin Mining Block Post arrived at a similar conclusion about the industry\u2019s growth in 2023. Their analysts predict that the cost of miners \u201cwill move sideways and gradually trend upwards\u201d as it did in 2020.\n\nPressure from more capable ASICs and the upcoming BTC halving\n\nThe existing Bitcoin mining industry also faces significant challenges from the arrival of new and efficient machines and reduced rewards after the eventual halving in 2024.\n\nSince June 2021, more energy-efficient miners have been arriving, offering more than 100 TH/s per joule. This trend accelerated by Q2 2022 with the launch of new hardware equipment that had more than twice the efficiency of existing miners at the time. The breakeven prices of some of these miners are below $15,000.\n\nThe launch dates of miners with their power ratings. Source: Hashrate Index\n\nThe increase in efficiency will likely flatten out for the next couple of years due to limitations in microprocessor chip size. The most efficient miner produced by Bitmain, the S19 XP, has a 5 nm chip. Going below this size significantly increases the cost and risk of production errors.\n\nStill, as more of these types of equipment flood the market, the mining difficulty for existing players will increase and slowly drive them out. Thus, only competitive miners who can successfully expand and sustain operations will survive this phase.\n\nOn top of that, the miners will also have to prepare for the March 2024 halving event. CoinShares research pointed out that, given how halving will directly impact the miners, \u201ca potential strategy by mining companies may be to focus on reducing operating expenses above their cash-costs (including overhead, debt, hosting, etc.).\u201d\n\nWill miners realize profits in 2023?\n\nThe above data suggests that the worst days of miner capitulation could be finished. However, the industry remains under considerable pressure with regard to the current challenge of BTC accumulation.\n\nMiners continue to be prominent sellers in the market. An update from Coinbase Institutional on Jan. 19 stated that \u201ccrypto miners have started to be a bit more aggressive in selling.\u201d\n\nThe one-hop supply metric of Bitcoin miners is calculated from the total holdings of addresses that received tokens from mining pools. The indicator recorded a slight uptick in miner balance since the start of 2023. However, the total amount is still below 2019 lows, pointing to the challenges of a swift recovery unless the price favors miners.\n\nBitcoin one-hop miner supply. Source Coinmetrics\n\nThe fact that miners are continuing to sell with little hope of recovery in the short term could ruin the hopes of those expecting a parabolic run in 2023. Nevertheless, the good news is that the worst days of capitulation might be in the past. While slow and steady, miners can continue to grow, start accumulating again and help stage the next bullish rally.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "If CBDCs Are the Future of Money, What Does That Mean for Bitcoin? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The concept of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) -- digital money backed and issued by a central bank -- has been bubbling under the surface for the past few years. Now, it looks like it is ready to take off. The topic has already been debated at this year's World Economic Forum in Switzerland, and Bank of America (BAC 0.20%) just released a report suggesting that central bank digital currencies have the potential to revolutionize the global financial system. According to that report, these digital currencies represent \"the most significant technological advancement in the history of money.\"\n\nIn many ways, it's a question of when, not if, this transformational change is going to happen. According to the Atlantic Council, 114 nations around the world are exploring the introduction of CBDCs, and 18 of the G20 nations are in the advanced stages of launching one. So, if CBDCs are \"the future of money,\" what does that mean for Bitcoin (BTC 2.16%)? After all, wasn't Bitcoin supposed to be the future of money?\n\nScenario 1: CBDCs fail to take off\n\nWhile some nations -- such as China -- are well advanced in the pilot stages of their CBDC rollouts, other nations lag behind. The United States, notably, is far behind other nations when it comes to a CBDC rollout. In September 2022, the White House released a report titled \"Technical Possibilities for a Central Bank Digital Currency,\" and it's clear there are a lot of potential stumbling blocks. For one, as the paper points out, there is concern about equitable access and what impact a \"digital dollar\" might have on the average U.S. citizen. There are also a number of purely technological issues to sort out.\n\nFor reasons such as these, it's easy to imagine a scenario in which CBDCs never really get off the ground, and Bitcoin emerges as the winner when it comes to digital currencies. In many ways, that was the vision that many people had for Bitcoin at the outset. For more than a decade, crypto enthusiasts have argued that Bitcoin should replace traditional fiat currencies. From this perspective, CBDCs are just reinventing the wheel. If you buy into this narrative, then Bitcoin is a strong long-term buy and hold, because it will be the future of money.\n\nScenario 2: CBDCs and Bitcoin coexist\n\nOf course, it's possible central banks will manage to work out all the intricacies of CBDCs and launch them into the market. But that doesn't mean the average person is going to use them. For example, due to their complexity, CBDCs might just be used as tools to facilitate transactions between central banks and commercial banks, or as a way for the government to interact directly with citizens. But they might never go mainstream. For example, you might pay taxes with a CBDC account, or you might receive a stimulus check via a CBDC account, but you wouldn't shop online and pay for your purchases with your CBDC account.\n\nThis is probably the most likely scenario, simply because there could be a massive outcry from the private sector if any of today's major financial players -- such as commercial banks -- are disintermediated out of the system. And private citizens might respond quite negatively if they think CBDCs are being used by central banks to gain sensitive information or data about them, such as their precise spending patterns.\n\nScenario 3: CBDCs replace Bitcoin\n\nIn this scenario, CBDCs become a huge hit, people realize the limitations of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and cash disappears. In this potential future, the past decade will be seen as just a period of experimentation with digital currencies. Historians will say that Bitcoin helped pave the way for national CBDCs, but lament the fact that the original crypto has largely been relegated to the dustbin of history.\n\nThe possibility of a course of events like this may be a reason why some predict that Bitcoin will eventually go to zero. They realize the immense forces at work in the financial system, and the need for central banks and sovereign governments to retain their authority and power for this system to work. If you believe in the likelihood of this scenario, then Bitcoin is not a suitable long-term investment option, because regulators will eventually find a way to limit its scale and reach.\n\nIs Bitcoin the future of money?\n\nI'm bullish both short term and long term on Bitcoin. If you read through the technical papers about CBDCs, it's striking how cryptocurrencies already solve many of the problems that CBDCs are supposed to solve. For example, one big issue is financial inclusion, or the need to include everyone in a new digital financial system. What easier way is there than by empowering people to create their own mobile blockchain wallets in order to hold Bitcoin, such as they are already doing in El Salvador?\n\nUltimately, digital currencies have the potential to revolutionize the global financial system, as Bank of America suggests. The only question is who will be the ultimate winners here. Right now, I'm putting my full faith in Bitcoin. Governments are good at many things, but not at financial innovation."

        "title": "Bitcoin derivatives data shows room for BTC price to move higher this week - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "This week Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to a 2023 high at $23,100 and the move followed a notable recovery in traditional markets, especially the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, which gained 2.9% on Jan. 20.\n\nEconomic data continues to boost investors\u2019 hope that the United States Federal Reserve will reduce the pace and length of interest rate hikes. For instance, sales of previously owned homes fell 1.5% in December, the 11th consecutive decline after high mortgage rates in the United States severely impacted demand.\n\nOn Jan. 20, Google announced that it would lay off 12,000 workers, more than 6% of its global workforce. The bad news continues to trigger buying activity on risk assets, but Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, chief U.S. equity strategist at JPMorgan, expects weaker earnings guidance to \u201cput downward pressure\" on the stock market.\n\nThe fear of recession increased on Jan. 20 after Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said that a soft recession should be tolerated if it meant bringing inflation down.\n\nSome analysts have pegged Bitcoin\u2019s gains to a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection \u2014 allowing the troubled Genesis Capital to seek the reorganization of debts and its business activities. But, more importantly, the move decreases the risk of a fire sale on Grayscale Investments assets, including the $13.3 billion trust fund Grayscale GBTC.\n\nLet\u2019s look at derivatives metrics to understand better how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nBitcoin margin longs dropped after the pump to $21,000\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because it allows investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nFor example, one can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only short the cryptocurrency as they bet on its price declining. Unlike futures contracts, the balance between margin longs and shorts isn't always matched.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin lending ratio increased from Jan. 12 to Jan. 16, signaling that professional traders increased their leverage longs as Bitcoin gained 18%.\n\nHowever, the indicator reversed its trend as the excessive leverage, 35 times larger for buying activity on Jan. 16, retreated to a neutral-to-bullish level on Jan. 20.\n\nCurrently at 15, the metric favors stablecoin borrowing by a wide margin and indicates that shorts are not confident about building bearish leveraged positions.\n\nStill, such data does not explain whether pro traders became less bullish or decided to reduce their leverage by depositing additional margin. Hence, one should analyze options markets to understand if the sentiment has changed.\n\nOptions traders are neutral despite the recent rally\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign whenever arbitrage desks and market makers are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nThe indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put options premium is higher than risk call options.\n\nIn short, the skew metric will move above 10% if traders fear a Bitcoin price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 10% skew.\n\nBitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nAs displayed above, the 25% delta skew reached its lowest level in more than 12 months on Jan. 15. Option traders were finally paying a premium for bullish strategies instead of the opposite.\n\nRelated: Genesis bankruptcy case scheduled for first hearing\n\nCurrently, at minus 2%, the delta skew signals that investors are pricing similar odds for bull and bear cases, which is somewhat less optimistic than expected considering the recent rally toward $22,000.\n\nDerivatives data puts the bullish case in check as buyers using stablecoin margin significantly reduced their leverage and option markets are pricing similar risks for either side. On the other hand, bears have not found a level where they would be comfortable opening short positions by borrowing Bitcoin on margin markets.\n\nTraditional markets continue to play a crucial role in setting the trend, but Bitcoin bulls have no reason to fear as long as derivatives metrics remain healthy.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Back in the day, acquiring Bitcoin with a debit or credit card used to be extremely challenging; even tech-savvy individuals experienced great difficulties with acquiring the lucrative cryptocurrency.\n\nThankfully, a lot of reputable and trusted exchange platforms are now available, like eToro, Binance, Coinbase and CoinMama. These exchanges allow for bitcoins to easily be purchased with credit or debit cards.\n\nIndividuals will need to create a bitcoin wallet before they can utilize the full potential of bitcoin exchanges. Wallets are quite easy to make and can be stored on a phone, on a computer, online, or in a physical way, such as a piece of paper or some sort of cold storage method.\n\nAnother thing to bare in mind when purchasing your bitcoin, is the fees that the exchange will charge yon each transaction \u2013 make sure you look at what the charges will be and compare them across the exchanges we have listed below to be sure of getting the best deal with your bitcoin purchase.\n\nIn this post we have put together a list of the most reputable online exchanges for purchasing bitcoin using your debit or credit card. There are also crypto-only exchanges that could be a better fit for crypto traders. While it is relatively harder to transfer your fiat currency into cryptos, making the jump from one crypto exchange to another is simple.\n\nThe are numerous crypto exchanges out there will all offer something different to their clients. No matter what you want to do in the world of cryptocurrencies, this post will help you find the right tools for the job!\n\nCoinbase: Our Top Pick & Easiest Method\n\nCoinbase is the globe\u2019s largest exchange platform. Currently, the platform is fully functional in the United States, Canada, Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Singapore.\n\nThe platform allows users to instantly purchase bitcoins with a credit or debit card. You simply need to create an account on the platform, confirm some personal details, and log in.\n\nCoinbase may be one of the best choices for people that live in the US, as they are up to date on all the tax laws that US citizens and residents need to follow. Some users were upset that Coinbase shared all its clients\u2019 trading history with US tax authorities, but this is necessary for any company that wants to interact with the US financial system.\n\nIt is actually a benefit for people that have to follow US tax law, as the penalties that the US Internal Revenue Service can impose on late taxes are severe. Anyone who lives in the US and trades cryptos needs to be well-educated in their tax responsibilities.\n\nOccasionally, Coinbase may prompt users to upload some form of government-issued identification \u2013 this can be in the form of Driving License, Passport etc. It is recommended to verify your account with as much ID as you can this then increase your purchase limits, allowing you to buy more bitcoin with credit or debit card.\n\nAs time goes on, you will also find that your purchasing limits increase, for much larger orders ( in the thousands ) you will need to add your bank details and send a wire transfer.\n\nOnce the verification process is complete, users can navigate over to their profile and find an option to add payment methods to their account. Users can link their PayPal account, bank account, or debit/credit card. Keep in mind that purchases made directly through bank accounts take up to five days to get verified.\n\nAll the cryptocurrencies purchased through Coinbase are sent directly to your Coinbase wallet. The platform doesn\u2019t charge any fees for the use of debit cards. However, it does charge a small fee of 3.7 percent per credit card transaction.\n\nFor further information, take a look at our full Coinbase review.\n\nVisit Coinbase\n\nCoinMama\n\nCoinMama is a large bitcoin brokerage that allows users to acquire coins with their debit or credit cards. It is based in Israel and has a global client base. The platform issues small fees for transactions. To make up for this, however, the limits for how many bitcoins a user can buy are much higher in comparison to Coinbase.\n\nUsers can acquire up to $5,000 of coins per day or up to $20,000 per month. All users need to do to use CoinMama is to set up an account, log in, and navigate to the profile page section to fill in personal information.\n\nFollowing this, users will be introduced to a page that allows them to select how many bitcoins they would like to purchase, and once a fitting amount has been selected, users will be allowed to add their preferred payment methods and bitcoin addresses.\n\nUsers will also be required to verify their phone number and email address. CoinMama does not require most users to upload their government-issued ID. After completing the aforementioned steps and passing the verification process, users will be able to acquire bitcoins through CoinMama.\n\nOne of the things that sets CoinMama apart from other exchanges is its high purchase limits, and willingness to deal with just about anyone. It has very few restrictions on who can use the exchange, which is good news for people who don\u2019t live in North America or the EU.\n\nCoin Mama has a great looking platform that will allow its clients to trade in numerous major and minor cryptos. On the downside, it isn\u2019t the cheapest exchange out there.\n\nSome of the larger exchanges that allow the use of credit cards to purchase cryptos aren\u2019t always going to be competitive with crypto only exchanges. Looking into your options for crypto-crypto trading could make sense if you plan on trading a lot.\n\nFind out more in our full review.\n\nVisit Coinmama\n\nBitPanda\n\nBitPanda is a large and trusted bitcoin exchange platform based out of Austria. Its biggest drawback is that it only offers its services to residents of Europe. It is fully automated, which makes transactions fast and secure.\n\nThe platform also allows users to acquire Ethereum. BitPanda bares the same verification processes as the other major exchanges. However, the purchase limits for credit card transactions are over $2,000 a day, with up to $75,000 per month.\n\nOther payment methods allow purchases of up to $10,000 per day or $300,000 per month. Transaction fees are also quite low, making BitPanda a great option to buy bitcoins with credit or debit cards for citizens of European countries.\n\nBitPanda will allow you to hold GBP, USD, EUR, CHF, as well as 25 different cryptos in the same account. Being able to hold numerous fiat and cryptos in the same account is convenient, and could be useful for people that want a lot of flexibility when it comes to their asset structure.\n\nIf you plan on buying a lot of crypto at BitPanda, the exchange will probably want to know where the money is coming from. Austria has a heavily regulated banking system, and large amounts of money passing through your account will attract attention.\n\nOverall BitPanda is worth considering if you want to buy a bunch of crypto with a credit or debit card, and live in the countries it serves. BitPanda also supports loads of other payment and withdraw options, like SEPA, Neteller and Skrill.\n\nRead our Bitpanda review here.\n\nVisit BitPanda\n\nCEX.IO\n\nCEX.io is one of the world\u2019s oldest bitcoin exchanges that operates in the United States, Europe, and certain South American countries.\n\nCEX.io is wildly popular and quite well trusted by the cryptocurrency community. It was one of the most powerful forces in crypto mining for a short time, but today the company focuses on trading cryptos. It offers a range of services and levels of verification.\n\nTrading fees on the platform are fairly low. However, the verification process is more extensive than on other exchanges. Occasionally, users may be prompted to upload a picture of themselves along with some form of government-issued ID. CEX.io operates under the same principles as most other popular bitcoin exchanges.\n\nIt is important to understand that CEX.io offers both a cryptocurrency brokerage service, and an exchange. The fees that CEX.io charges on its brokerage platform can be high, but the fees for trading cryptos with them are much lower.\n\nThere are also restrictions in place that prevent people from using CEX.io. Depending on where you live, you may or may not be able to use certain funding options, or use the platform at all.\n\nIf you are from one of the following countries, you can\u2019t buy cryptos from CEX.io with a credit card:\n\nAfghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iceland and Vietnam.\n\nIf you are from one of the following countries, you won\u2019t be able to fund your account with a wire transfer:\n\nAfghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Eritrea, Ethiopia, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Tunisia, Turkey, Vietnam, Yemen, Zimbabwe, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Kenya, Liberia, Libya and Guinea.\n\nResidents of the following US States will be denied an account at CEX.io:\n\nAlabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Guam, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.\n\nAs long as you aren\u2019t on those lists, you should be able to use any of the tools that CEX.io has. You will need to go though an extensive verification process to deal in larger amounts of cryptos, but that is becoming the norm at most exchanges that deal with fiat currency.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have any direct experience with the customer service department at CEX.io, is has gained a reputation for being less than helpful. Be sure to dig into the information that is available online before deciding on a crypto exchange, so you are making an informed decision.\n\nFull Review of CEX located here.\n\nVisit CEX\n\nChangelly\n\nChangelly is a cryptocurrency exchange which is associated with converting one type of currency to another. It also allows you to buy most of the major cryptos with a credit card, and have the cryptocurrency sent to your crypto wallet.\n\nIts platform is really easy to use and offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies to choose from. They also offer purchasing of some currencies in USD and they accept payment via Mastercard or VISA so they provide an easy way to obtain bitcoin from your bank or credit card facilities.\n\nChangelly is a very trusted exchange with a \u201cGreat\u201d rating on TrustPilot, having been around for over 2 years now with no problems. Changelly is easy to signup for with just email verification required which means you can your chosen currency in your wallet fairly quickly.\n\nThe process of registering and buying cryptos from Changelly is straightforward, but you should have some sort of hardware or software wallet, and know how to send cryptos to it.\n\nChangelly has connections with some of the biggest crypto exchanges operating today, like Bittrex and Poloniex. By having access to crypto market makers, Changelly offers its customers leading rates on purchases and exchange, as well as deep liquidity for big orders.\n\nYou will need to be able to verify your identity to use a credit or debit card with Changelly, but it may be as easy as entering a SMS code for smaller purchases after you supply basic personal information.\n\nIf you want to deal with an established crypto exchange that offers some of the best rates in the industry, it is worth checking out Changelly.\n\nOur review of Changelly is here.\n\nVisit Changelly\n\nCrypto-Only Exchanges Could be Useful as Well\n\nOnce you own cryptos, there are a number of exchanges out there to choose from.\n\nThe following exchanges don\u2019t offer direct purchase of cryptos with credit or debit cards (though that may change at any time, so check before you dismiss them outright), but they do offer great trading platforms and low rates on crypto trading.\n\nOne of the most important things to consider is what your goals in the crypto world are. Some people just want to grab a few tokens and hold onto them for the long term. If you are looking to make a long-term investment in cryptos, then buying a few with a credit or debit card and storing them on a secure wallet is fine.\n\nThe fees that you pay to buy and transfer cryptos won\u2019t really matter in the grand scheme, as your expectation for price movements is far higher than a few percent. If you are looking to trade cryptos actively, then it is far more important to look into the fees that an exchange charges.\n\nCrypto only exchanges can have extremely low rates, and some also offer token pairs that are difficult to find elsewhere.\n\nBinance\n\nBinance have grown rapidly into one of the world\u2019s most used crypto exchanges. It was founded in China, but is now serving its clients from the crypto-wonderland of Malta.\n\nOne of the biggest selling points for Binance is the fact that it offers two kinds of trading platforms. It has a basic platform for people that are new to crypto trading, and an advanced platform for traders that need more functionality.\n\nLike most crypto-only exchanges, there is little in the way of KYC for new clients that don\u2019t need to trade in large amounts of cryptos. A level 1 account will get you a daily withdrawal limit of 2BTC, and a level 2 account will earn you a withdrawal limit of 100BTC.\n\nA level 2 account will require photo ID, and there are higher withdrawal limits available for people that need one. If you need to move a lot of crypto through Binance just drop them a line, and they will let you know what you need to provide in terms of ID verification.\n\nBinance\u2019s fees are super low, and can also be discounted by using their token. If you want to learn more about the exchange, check out our review right here.\n\nVisit Binance\n\nNote: If you are in the USA, you will need to register with Binance.US\n\nVisit Binance US\n\nBittrex\n\nBittrex still doesn\u2019t accept credit or debit cards, but it will allow you to deposit money in USD via a wire transfer. The exchange was founded in 2014 and is based in Seattle, Washington. It has definitely been in the top 10 global exchanges when it comes to daily turnover, and has a good reputation for customer service.\n\nThe great part about Bittrex is the sheer number of BTC pairs it supports. There are at least 450 BTC pairs on the exchange, and also some other options for people that want to trade in other major cryptos. While the company won\u2019t allow its clients to use credit or debit cards, it does offer bank transfers at good rates.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind with Bittrex is that if you want to fund your account with fiat currency, there is a minimum deposit of $10,000. That amount might seem high to some people, and there are lots of other options out there if you need an exchange who will take a smaller amount of money to get started.\n\nBittrex was founded by a software engineer who worked at Amazon and Blackberry that specializes in data security. The exchange has a reputation for keeping its clients cryptos safe, and the trading platform it offers is on par with any of the other crypto exchanges on this list.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Bittrex, check out our full review here.\n\nPoloniex\n\nPoloniex has established itself as one of the foremost North American crypto exchanges. In addition to having a large daily turnover and deep liquidity, Poloniex was taken over by Circle, which is backed in part by investment bank Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhile it is a great exchange that offers crypto traders a lot, Poloniex isn\u2019t going to be right for everyone. It is strictly a crypto-only exchange that doesn\u2019t deal with fiat currency at all. That means that you can only fund it with cryptos, not bank transfers or any kind of credit or debit card.\n\nPoloniex does offer its clients Tether, which is a stablecoin that is tied to the US dollar. It isn\u2019t a perfect system, and the value of Tether does vary from day to day. If fiat currency isn\u2019t a concern, and you are happy to deal solely in cryptocurrencies, Poloniex is one of the best exchanges out there to learn more about.\n\nOn the plus side, Poloniex was the first crypto exchange to be regulated by the SEC and FINRA. The USA is one of the strictest countries when it comes to financial regulations, and that puts Poloniex a step above offshore exchanges that have far less regulatory oversight to deal with.\n\nThe trading platform that Poloniex offers its clients is geared toward experienced traders, and it might not be a perfect fit for everyone. Its fee structure is extremely competitive, and the exchange offers deep liquidity and a huge range of tokens.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about Poloniex, have a look at this in-depth review (LINK).\n\nHADAX\n\nHADAX is an interesting idea from Huobi. If cryptos are the wild west of the financial world, HADAX is the unknown frontier of the crypto wilderness. Huobi created the platform to allow the trade of smaller tokens, which can be extremely volatile.\n\nIf you are looking for an exchange to trade in major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH or XRP, HADAX probably isn\u2019t the exchange for you. The platform was set up to allow its users to vote on which tokens should be listed via HT tokens, which makes the listing process both decentralized and autonomous.\n\nHADAX doesn\u2019t deal in fiat currency, and will only accept deposits in cryptos. On the plus side deposits are accepted with no charge, and the trading fees on the platform are low. If you are looking to get into some extremely speculative digital assets, HADAX could be worth a look.\n\nFinding Other Exchanges\n\nBefore jumping on any exchange that you come across selling bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s vital that you do your due diligence pertaining to the platform. Make sure that the platform you are looking to use has a good and trusted reputation, and read reviews.\n\nThere are many scammers out there, as well as shady exchanges. It is not uncommon for unscrupulous bitcoin exchanges to steal their users\u2019 credit card information and other sensitive data.\n\nIf you are looking for other options for the purchase of Bitcoin, you are in luck. There are many ways to get Bitcoin if you don\u2019t want to share much of your personal data online, though you will need to jump though a few hoops to make the deal happen.\n\nFeel Like Using Cash to Buy Bitcoin?\n\nOne of the biggest selling points for Bitcoin was its near total anonymity. Now that most exchanges where you can buy and trade cryptos are going to ask for some form of ID verification (especially if you want to buy your cryptos with fiat currency), it is much harder to get into Bitcoin without sharing personal information.\n\nWhile it is nearly impossible to buy Bitcoins without leaving some sort of transactional evidence behind, there are options for people that want to buy cryptos with cash. Here are a few ways you can go right from cash into cryptocurrency, as long as you are willing to walk the path less traveled.\n\nBuy at a Bitcoin ATM\n\nBitcoin ATMs have been installed in many places, especially in North America and the EU. While turning a bunch of cash into Bitcoin with crypto ATMs isn\u2019t going to be easy, they can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptos with relative anonymity.\n\nThe first major downside of buying Bitcoin in person is that most crypto ATMs have a limit on how much can be bought at one time. If you only want to pick up a few hundred dollars or euros worth of BTC or ETH they could be a good option, but stashing tens of thousands of dollars away on the sly with crypto ATMs isn\u2019t going to be easy.\n\nAdditionally, there are almost certainly going to be people and cameras around wherever a crypto ATM is located. The people working at the store will probably remember that you show up every few days with a stack of cash to buy cryptos, or at the very least a security camera will keep a record of it.\n\nWhile certainly not a perfect solution for everyone, Bitcoin ATMs are a viable options to turn your cash directly into cryptos. If there are a lot of them where you live, you might be able to do a few laps around the metro area and pick up an appreciable amount of crypto on the DL.\n\nLocalBitcoins\n\nLocalBitcoins is an interesting platform. Started in 2012 in Finland as an easy way for people to trade Bitcoin on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis, it remains a great tool for people that want to bypass the cryptos exchanges.\n\nThe process of using LocalBitcoins is pretty simple. All you have to do is open an account, and provide some basic personal information. There are a number of ways to pay for the Bitcoins, including \u2018cash in the mail\u2019, which opens up a whole range of bartering options.\n\nRemember, LocalBitcoins is a P2P exchange, so it is important to make sure and research the counterparty you are considering a trade with. Make sure they have done a lot of deals, and haven\u2019t raised any red flags with previous clients.\n\nThe fees that LocalBitcoins charges are generally quite low, and are usually only applied to the person that took out the advert. On the flip side, the rate that Bitcoins are sold at on the platform tends to be above market rate, and the amount of liquidity if obviously much lower than a crypto exchange.\n\nIf you want to learn more about LocalBitcoins, check out our full review here.\n\nVisit LocalBitcoins\n\nWrapping up \u2013 Final Thoughts\n\nWhile there certainly are risks involved with purchasing bitcoins from exchanges using your bank cards, it\u2019s also one of the easiest ways to acquire this cryptocurrency.\n\nIn fact, it is comparable to how regular shopping is done online. However, buying bitcoins with credit and debit cards usually entails high fees and can leave buyers exposed to risk. Fees for purchases made with bank accounts are generally lower.\n\nKeep in mind that bitcoin purchases on exchanges with stolen credit or debit cards are impossible due to the verification processes that exchanges have put in place to protect buyers. Anonymous purchases of bitcoins are also impossible due to the verification processes.\n\nUnfortunately, pre-loaded debit or credit cards don\u2019t work on most popular exchanges. If you are in possession of a prepaid debit or credit card, you may have to refer to LocalBitcoins to purchase bitcoins.\n\nIndividuals should devote a lot of time to researching exchanges and platforms before buying any bitcoins. Due to the verification processes implemented on most, it would be truly terrible to have your personal information or government ID fall into the hands of some scammers or shady platform.\n\nIt\u2019s also highly recommended that users transfer their bitcoins from exchange platforms directly to their personal bitcoin wallets to keep acquired assets safe from theft.\n\nKeep in mind that you aren\u2019t limited to using one exchange. This means you can own accounts on all of the reputable exchanges, like Coinbase, BitPanda, CoinMama, LocalBitcoins, CEX.io and Changelly. This is perfect for users who feel restricted by exchange platform transaction limits."

Discover SCENE\n\nThe podcasting revenue model is getting a Bitcoin facelift.\n\nLooking to expand its footprint beyond gaming, mobile payment firm ZEBEDEE announced Tuesday its partnership with the \u201clisten-to-earn\u201d podcast platform Fountain to give listeners and podcasters the ability to earn Bitcoin using the app.\n\n\u201cWith this partnership, we\u2019re supporting a new type of business model and economic activity, not just for the payments space, but in general,\u201d ZEBEDEE\u2019s chief strategy officer Ben Cousens said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLaunched in October 2019, ZEBEDEE is a Bitcoin-centric gaming firm that releases games through its mobile app. ZEBEDEE recently launched two new play-to-earn games, Bitcoin Chess and Bitcoin Scratch, a digital scratch-card game with mobile game studio Viker.\n\nWith play-to-earn games, a user plays online games and receives rewards with real-world value. Listen-to-earn aims to do something similar for podcasters, creating a direct link between podcasters and their audience and letting listeners earn Bitcoin for every minute they tune in.\n\nInstead of an expensive and sweeping ad campaign, the listen-to-earn model aims to only spend money on listeners who actually want to listen.\n\n\u201cWhen money moves as seamlessly as information, or in this case, audio, it just opens up a world of possibilities, and we\u2019re happy to be pioneering what that means in the podcasting space alongside Fountain,\u201d Cousens said.\n\nFountain, ZEBEDEE and \u2018listen-to-earn\u2019\n\nFountain launched its listen-to-earn program in June 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe program allows listeners and podcasters to get rewarded for the value they provide. Fountain users will earn money for their first hour of daily podcast listening.\n\nTo draw in listeners, the platform uses RSS feeds to make podcasts from other platforms available to its listeners. Using the Fountain app to listen to their favorite podcast, users earn small amounts of Bitcoin, called sats or satoshis, after the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nWhen the user is ready to cash out, they connect to the ZEBEDEE app to withdraw.\n\n\u201cThis type of Value for Value exchange is the future of content creation,\u201d Fountain\u2019s founder and CEO Oscar Merry said in a press release.\n\n\u201cA few years from now, we\u2019ll look back at when we paid subscriptions for content platforms that aren\u2019t related to how much we actually use those platforms and laugh at how basic and inefficient it was,\u201d he said."

German Bitcoiners took to Twitter and social media to share photos and videos of the illuminated logo, which was then shared by prominent Bitcoin Twitter accounts.\n\nThe man behind the B, a German Bitcoiner going by the name of Tilo, told Cointelegraph why the idea came to him:\n\n\u201cWe just want to call attention on Bitcoin! We\u2019re fans of guerilla actions like this and will keep on track.\u201c\n\nTilo is CEO of an events agency that will host the \u201cBest of Blockchain\u201d conference this year. He explained that the process is simple for setting up light displays: \u201cWhat you need is a mixer, power station, special Bitcoin logo.\u201d Tilo had tried the process at the end of last year, but it didn't go as planned. \u201cThe beamer I used was too weak,\u201d he explained.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Bitcoin logo or themes have been projected onto iconic buildings.

At the time, GBTC was trading in the $7.46-$9.48 range versus $12.25 in January 2023.\n\nGBTC price, of course, recovered alongside Bitcoin, rising roughly 40% from its November lows. The recovery in January also helped reduce the GBTC \u201cdiscount\u201d from nearly 50% to 40%, according to YCharts.\n\nGBTC daily price chart.

Source: Cathiesark.com\n\nMoreover, Ark's reduction in shares since November appears in line with its officially \u201cbearish view\u201d on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, as mentioned in its December report, which stated that:\n\n\u201cThe Digital Currency Group (DCG) appears to be one of the biggest questions marks in the crypto industry at this time.\u201c\n\nThe company also expressed concerns about Genesis Global, a cryptocurrency lender owned by DCG. Genesis filed for bankruptcy while claiming $1 billion to $10 billion in liabilities to over 100,000 creditors.\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale has been unable to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF following rejections from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As Cointelegraph reported, an approval from the SEC could reset GBTC's discount to zero.\n\nNonetheless, as of Jan. 23, GBTC's share weight in Ark's portfolio has actually increased to 0.52% compared to its November 2022 low of 0.35%.\n\nGBTC shares' weight (purple) across Ark ETFs.

Source: Cathiesark.com\n\nOverall, Ark appears to be only increasing its exposure to the Bitcoin market, particularly as Wood is well known for her consistent $1 million by 2030 BTC price prediction.\n\nCan the GBTC price rally continue?\n\nSimilarly, Greenery Financial, an investment strategy firm, confirmed that it had shifted its GBTC exposure to ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) due to the above-mentioned risks around DCG.\n\n\u201cAny bad news, be it Cathie Wood selling out of GBTC or DCG going bankrupt, will spark the same fears and doubt - of uncertainty - and likely cause an expansion of the discount once again, \" the firm warned in its SeekingAlpha note, saying:\n\n\u201cWith Bitcoin having no real catalyst in the short term and plenty of potential downside catalysts, there are plenty of risks here from the NAV side as well.\u201c\n\nNonetheless Bitcoin and GBTC prices may keep on rallying through Q1 from a technical perspective.\n\nOn the daily chart, GBTC has reclaimed its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave in the chart below) near $9.68 as support.\n\nRelated: Grayscale files brief in ETF suit against SEC, oral arguments may come within months\n\nUpward momentum could see it test the 200-day EMA (the blue wave) near $15 if it continues to float above the 50-day EMA wave, similar to what happened in March-April 2022.\n\nGBTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe technical upside target falls in line with what Pat Tschosik, senior portfolio strategist at Ned Davis Research, predicted about the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.\n\nHe argued that GBTC price could not only double by mid-2023, but also narrow the extant discount gap with Bitcoin's spot price.\n\n\u201cWe recommend GBTC [\u2026] as a way to play Bitcoin because it has a \u2018potential NAV kicker rebate,\u2019 which not only means it would go up if Bitcoin goes up, but also closing its current large 35% rebate on NAV,\u201d Ned Davis Research said in a note to clients.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Over the past few years, a number of companies have attempted to act as the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank, promising lucrative returns to customers who deposited their bitcoin or other digital assets.\n\nIn a span of less than 12 months, nearly all of the biggest of those companies have failed spectacularly. Last week, Genesis filed Chapter 11, joining Voyager Digital, Celsius and BlockFi on the list of companies that have either filed for bankruptcy protection or gone out of business.\n\nThis subset of the industry grew as cryptocurrency enthusiasts were looking to build their own parallel world in finance untethered to traditional banking and government-issued currencies. But lacking safeguards, and without a government backstop, these companies failed in domino-like fashion. What started with one crypto company collapsing in May spilled over onto one crypto lending firm and then the next.\n\nFurther, government regulators started clamping down on crypto lending companies\u2019 ability to advertise their services, saying that their products should have been regulated by securities regulators.\n\nThe collapse is reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis, but on a much smaller scale. There are no worries that the collapse of these crypto firms will impact the broader economy.\n\nCrypto lending companies like Voyager, Genesis and BlockFi were trying to do what banks do in traditional finance: take in crypto deposits, give depositors a dividend on their stored crypto, and then make loans to earn a profit. It\u2019s what the banking industry has done for hundreds of years, but with government-sanctioned currencies.\n\nThe biggest drawback to crypto lending is the lack of safeguards. There is no deposit insurance, government stopgap, or even a privately run entity to protect depositors if their crypto bank were to fail. This was fine when crypto prices were moving higher because the collateral banks were accepting in exchange for the loans was increasing in value.\n\nDemand for crypto deposits was so high, firms were willing to pay a yield of 10% of more on depositors\u2019 crypto holdings.\n\nBut then crypto prices started falling and kept falling. Bitcoin, for instance, plunged from over $65,000 in November 2021 to below $17,000 last November. As a result, much of the underlying collateral these firms were holding became worth less than the loans they had issued, effectively making several \u201ccrypto banks\u201d insolvent.\n\nThe first two crypto lending firms to collapse were Celsius and Voyager Digital. The companies had been exposed to both falling crypto prices as well as risky loans made to crypto hedge funds like Three Arrows Capital, which was forced to liquidate and go out of business in June.\n\nBlockFi, another crypto lender, turned to then-crypto giant FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried for a rescue. Bankman-Fried gave BlockFi a financial lifeline, one of several moves that earned Bankman-Fried plaudits as a savior or financial backstop for the crypto industry.\n\nBut FTX\u2019s own bankruptcy in November, caused by high-risk lending to its affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research, caused BlockFi\u2019s financial lifeline to wither away. BlockFi\u2019s own bankruptcy became an inevitability. In a show of how intertwined these crypto lenders became, Genesis made billions in loans to Alameda.\n\nSaddled with bad loans, many of these high-tech firms experienced a very old phenomenon: depositors wanted their money back, and a bank run started.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT?\n\nThe tens of thousands of customers at these crypto lending firms are now waiting to see if their assets can be recovered or found in bankruptcy court, which could take months or even years. At Genesis, more than $900 million in customer funds are now locked up in bankruptcy.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether crypto lending will see a return any time soon. After FTX failed, crypto exchange giant Binance announced it would start its own fund to provide rescue financing for a crypto firm in trouble, an idea that has its origins in government-sponsored central banking or deposit insurance.\n\nFurther, the crypto industry seems to coming around to the idea of some sort of regulation, which would provide a minimum of safeguards to depositors or investors that does not exist at the moment. There were several bills pending in Congress last year, but with the change in control to the Republicans in the House of Representatives, it\u2019s not clear whether the broader GOP has an interest in regulating the crypto industry."

        "title": "Bitcoin price surge: Breakthrough or bull trap? Pundits weigh in - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "While Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a strong price pump to kick off the new year, many industry pundits are not convinced the cryptocurrency will continue its upward trajectory \u2014 at least in the short to mid-term.\n\nThe impressive price surge \u2014 which saw BTC experience 14 days of consecutive price increases earlier this month \u2014 has called on many to consider whether the surge marks a significant \u201cbreakthrough\u201d or is indicative of a \u201cbull trap.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph on Jan. 23, James Edwards \u2014 a cryptocurrency analyst at Australian-based fintech firm Finder \u2014 said the argument for a \u201cbull trap\u201d is stronger, warning the recent surge could be \u201cshort-lived.\u201d\n\nHe stated that while the BTC price moved upwards over the weekend, the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 also made similar rallies:\n\n\u201cThis suggests to me that the rally in crypto is not unique, and instead part of a wider market uplift as inflation figures stall and a risk-on appetite appears to return to investments. So Bitcoin is just enjoying the effects of positive sentiment that originated elsewhere. This is likely to be short-lived.\u201d\n\nEdwards added that cryptocurrency markets still have some \u201csignificant hurdles to clear before a new bull market can begin.\u201d\n\nAmong those obstacles, he mentioned include the continued fallout over FTX\u2019s collapse and the recent Chapter 11 filing by Genesis on Jan. 19.\n\n\u201cAs such, we\u2019re going to see further sell-offs and downsizing as crypto firms adjust their balance sheets and dump tokens onto the market to cover debt and try to stay afloat,\u201d he explained.\n\nIn a statement to Cointelegraph, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone wasn\u2019t confident in the BTC price trajectory either, citing recessionary-like macroeconomic conditions as too big of a barrier for BTC to overcome.\n\n\u201cWith the world leaning into recession and most central banks tightening, I think the macroeconomic ebbing tide is still the primary headwind for Bitcoin and crypto prices.\u201d\n\nThe sentiment was also shared among some on Crypto Twitter, with cryptocurrency analyst and swing trader \u201cCapo of Crypto\u201d telling his 710,000 Twitter followers on Jan. 21 that BTC\u2019s push past resistance looks like \u201cthe biggest bull trap\u201d he has ever seen:\n\nI've been checking charts all this time, avoiding noise from Twitter. The way the upward movement is happening, the way htf resistances are being tested... it clearly looks manipulated, no real demand.\n\n\n\nOnce again, the biggest bull trap I've ever seen. But they won't trap me. \u2014 il Capo Of Crypto (@CryptoCapo_) January 21, 2023\n\nHowever, not all industry pundits were as bearish.\n\nCryptocurrency market analysis platform IncomeSharks appeared bullish, having shared a \u201cWall St. Cheat Sheet\u201d chart with its 379,300 Twitter followers on Jan. 22 making a mockery of the bears who think the latest price movements are indicative of a \u201cbull trap.\u201d\n\n#Bears at the Denial stage. \"It's just a bull trap\" \"It's all manipulation\". Waiting for the Panic part next... pic.twitter.com/Lo6nWyZPD2 \u2014 IncomeSharks (@IncomeSharks) January 22, 2023\n\nSem Agterberg, the CEO and co-founder of AI-based trading bot CryptoSea, also recently shared a flood of posts expressing positive sentiment toward BTC price action to his 431,700 Twitter followers, suggesting that a \u201cBULL FLAG BREAKOUT\u201d toward $25,000 may soon be on the cards.\n\nMeanwhile, others have refrained from making a forecast on the price, likely given the unpredictability of crypto markets.\n\nHere's my technical analysis of where Bitcoin's price is going. pic.twitter.com/cOFueErgGq \u2014 Dan Held (@danheld) January 21, 2023\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price consolidation opens the door for APE, MANA, AAVE and FIL to move higher\n\nAt the time of publication, Bitcoin was priced at $22,738, while the Crypto Fear and Greed Index was at \u201cNeutral\u201d with a score of 50 out of 100.\n\nThe cryptocurrency managed to break out of the \u201cFear\u201d zone on Jan. 13 \u2014 which was then scored at 31 \u2014 after the BTC price increased for seven consecutive days."

He noted:\n\n\u201cThis is just the start of the asset sales from BlockFi and other crypto firms in Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph reached out to BlockFi for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.\n\nBlockFi\u2019s attempt to liquidate its loans is likely part of efforts to pay off its creditors, which according to its bankruptcy filing in November, number over 100,000.\n\nAt the time of its bankruptcy, it was reported that BlockFi sold $239 million of its own cryptocurrency assets to cover the bankruptcy expenses and warned approximately 70% of its staff that they would lose their jobs.\n\nRelated: BlockFi bankruptcy filing triggers a wide range of community reactions\n\nEarlier this week, BlockFi petitioned the court in a Jan. 23 declaration to release funds to allow bonuses for key employees in a bid to retain them amid the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nBlockFi\u2019s chief people officer Megan Crowell told the court that without financial incentives, it\u2019s unlikely the company will be able to retain its employees.\n\nCrowell said it is highly likely many staff will leave the company without competitive compensation, noting that it would add further financial impact to the company down the road."

        "title": "Bitcoin Basics: A Beginner's Guide to Cryptocurrency - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Bitcoin Basics: A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Cryptocurrency\n\nDisclaimer: The text below is an advertorial article that is not part of Cryptonews.com editorial content.\n\nThe world is abuzz about bitcoin, which has left people wondering about bitcoin. More and more individuals today are interested in exploring digital currency, and its future. The following article will hopefully help demystify cryptocurrency.\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\n\nA cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency, secured by cryptography, which makes it impossible to double spend. Several cryptocurrencies are decentralised networks based on blockchain technology, or a distributed ledger enforced by a network of computers.\n\nHow does cryptocurrency work?\n\nMost cryptocurrencies work without the backing of a central bank or government. Rather than relying on government guarantees, a decentralised technology called blockchain underpins the operation of cryptocurrencies. These do not exist as a stack of notes or coins. Instead, they live on the internet. As a result, they must be regarded as virtual tokens, the value of which is determined by market forces created by those seeking to sell or buy them.\n\nIt is formed through a procedure known as mining, which involves employing computer processing power to solve complicated problems to earn coins. Users can furthermore purchase the currencies from brokers, which can then be stored and spent using encrypted wallets.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nThe widespread use of blockchain technology began in 2009, when its innovative use successfully launched the currency. It is a digital, append-only ledger that can be used to record any kind of asset, from goods and services to smart contracts, patients, and more. It is completely transparent in that the transactions are accessible to anyone. Unlike traditional currency controlled by a central bank, bitcoin is not directed by any entity. In other words, no single authority can manipulate the value. It is exchanged electronically by users through cryptographic addresses. Investors should stay updated with the latest bitcoin news to acquire more information on the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin-The Gamechanger\n\nFollowing the 2008 financial crisis, when the world realised there were problems with existing financial systems, Bitcoin emerged as a gold rush of opportunity. It was also the very first cryptocurrency developed through the blockchain, which changed the way people perceived money.\n\nPurpose of bitcoin:\n\nIt was created as a way for people to send money online. This digital currency was intended to offer an alternative payment system that would operate free of central control and be used just like traditional currencies.\n\nHow does bitcoin work?\n\nWith the help of the underlying technology, Bitcoin achieves the elimination of intermediaries. Each of them is a digital asset that can be stored at a cryptocurrency exchange or in a digital wallet. The coins represent the value of Bitcoin\u2019s current price; however, partial shares of the coin can be owned. Satoshi is the smallest denomination of each Bitcoin, sharing its name with the creator.\n\nBlockchain helps to eliminate intermediaries by replacing the trust that they bring to the table with cryptographic proof using CPU computing power. The transactions are recorded in a public ledger known as the blockchain. This enables users to trace the history of bitcoins and prevent them from spending coins they do not own.\n\nKey features of bitcoin:\n\nHere are the top features of bitcoin:\n\nIt is decentralized.\n\nThe network is a truly decentralised financial asset, as the validation procedure requires unanimous consensus among the nodes, prior to creating a block reward. Individual users are in full control of their bitcoins without the presence of any central authority that can seize or manipulate control of the bitcoin network. In other words, decentralisation acts as a check and balance system before blocks are added to the chain. This network is a core feature, making bitcoin completely unique.\n\nCensorship resistant:\n\nBitcoin is not only the most censorship-resistant cryptoasset, but also the most censorship-resistant network currently in existence. This is achieved through a process known as \u201cproof-of-work,\u201d which is how bitcoin is mined. Unwarranted search and seizure of private property and wealth is a long-term affair.\n\nImmutable:\n\nEvery transaction on the network is stored in a block linked to a previous block of transactions. Blockchain technology is immutable, and thus no entity can alter the information on the network. The transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in the blockchain. Immutability makes the network a lot more trustworthy and reliable, whilst setting it apart from other asset classes where forgery, a lack of transparency, or corruption can pose a risk to the investor.\n\nCapped supply:\n\nThere will never be more than 21 million bitcoins. This capped supply is built into the core of Bitcoin\u2019s code. There is no way one can exchange it unless there is unanimous consensus by a decentralised body of custodians who are elected to service. Bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply has become one of the key value propositions for the incentive and market demand to continue validating the network.\n\nReduced risk for merchants:\n\nGiven the nature of cryptocurrency, the payments are not of the traditional kind. This eliminates all hassle, helping merchants avoid any negative aspects of the system, such as credit card fraud, processing fees, and chargebacks. As bitcoins cannot be reserved, and do not carry any personal information, they promote security among merchants, who feel protected from any losses that might otherwise result from fraudulent credit card use.\n\nPros of bitcoin:\n\nHere are the top benefits of bitcoin:\n\nAccessibility and liquidity:\n\nAccessibility is one of the biggest benefits of cryptocurrency. It is a versatile currency that takes only a few minutes to transfer to another user. Moreover, it can also be used to purchase goods and services from the ever-growing list of places that accept it. This also simplifies spending and exchanging money, with the added benefit of having little to no fees applied. The coins can also be sold at any moment.\n\nMaintains anonymity and transparency:\n\nAlthough it is not completely anonymous, the users are identified by numerical codes and comprise multiple public keys. This ensures that there is no public tracking, and transactions cannot be traced back to the user. The transactions can be viewed permanently, which gives you transparency that safeguards them from fraudulent activities. Moreover, only the wallet owner can know the number of bitcoins.\n\nIndependence from central authority:\n\nThe decentralised currency is not regulated by a central bank or a single government. This means that authorities are likely to not freeze and demand your coins. Furthermore, there is no feasible way to implement a tax on bitcoin. Theoretically, it gives users autonomy and control over money, as the price is not linked to government policies.\n\nLightning-fast transactions:\n\nFiat currency takes days and weeks for transactions to complete. Bitcoin is different, and whether it is 10 a.m. or 2 a.m., you will get the money in an instant. There are no intermediaries involved, which eliminates waiting time and hassle. There are no limits, and the transfer cannot be reversed. All you must do is key in the bitcoin address and transfer away. There are no limits, and the transfer cannot be reversed.\n\nNo inflation:\n\nAnother big problem with traditional payment systems is that they can often lead to inflationary pressures. However, its decentralised nature minimises restrictions and creates an economy with a fixed supply of BTC in the market. This also means that you will never need to worry about digital assets depreciating due to loss in value over time, as bitcoin is limited by the number of bitcoins existing.\n\nSecurity:\n\nThey cannot sign or obtain your funds unless they have access to the private key for the crypto wallet. If you lose your private key, there is no way to recover the funds. In addition to this, transactions are secured by the nature of the blockchain system and the distributed network of computers verifying transactions. As computing power is added to the network, it gets a lot more secure. Any attack on the network to change the blockchain needs optimum computing power to confirm multiple blocks before the rest of the network can verify the accuracy of the ledger.\n\nPrivacy:\n\nBitcoin transactions are anonymous, making them ideal for people who prefer privacy. The BTC wallet owners comprise one or more public keys that act as their bitcoin address(es), which form the only information required to execute a transaction. Unlike the credit card system, where the billing address, name, and other information are needed to process a payment, in bitcoin, all you must do is key in the receiver\u2019s address.\n\nIf you are not sure how bitcoin helps, you can read the latest bitcoin news to stay updated.\n\nFuture of bitcoin:\n\nThe next decade could prove of significant importance to Bitcoin\u2019s evolution. Currently, cryptocurrency is poised between being a store of value and a medium of daily transactions. Investors and cryptocurrency enthusiasts have doubled down on their optimism regarding its future. The oncoming decade could prove pivotal for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more broadly.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAlthough it offers some exceptional benefits, many people still view it as a risky investment. However, like any investment, putting your money in Bitcoin requires proper research to make informed choices."

        "content": "Jameson Lopp is the co-founder & CTO of Casa. In this interview, we discuss why Casa has extended custody support to Ethereum, important security lessons from the Luke Dashir hack, Bitcoin security & inheritance planning, and how AI came of age in 2022 with the release of ChatGPT.\n\n- - - -\n\nLast year provided the most brutal examples of why \u201cnot your keys, not your coin\u201d should be the first thing anyone new to the ecosystem learns. Dave Portney\u2019s infamous tweet questioning where his Bitcoin was after FTX blew up, showed how generally unaware people are of the risks associated with exchanges, and the importance of custody in relation to ownership.\n\nHowever, there are also those who quite reasonably need greater protection than that offered by a hardware wallet. There are many examples of people losing access to their Bitcoin held off-exchange. Further, the hacking of Luke Dashir\u2019s security setup shows the risks of bespoke security solutions. This is where Casa comes in - providing multisig custody solutions for Bitcoin holders.\n\nCasa has now extended its service provision to Ethereum. For Bitcoin maximalists this may be viewed as a red line having been crossed. For those who hold Bitcoin and Ethereum, this may provide a practical one-stop shop solution that convinces them to take their holdings (including Bitcoin) off exchanges. There are merits to both sides of the pragmatism versus maximalism argument, which is sure to continue to be debated throughout 2023.\n\nAnd yet, history may relegate the significance of the collapses in crypto in 2022 behind last year's massive advances in AI technology. ChatGPT, in particular, has the potential to revolutionise the employment market: online customer services, copywriting, journalism, consulting, academia, computer programming\u2026 the disruption to white-collar workers could be unprecedented.\n\nDespite being less than 2 months old, ChatGPT has led to a pervading wave of excitement and hysteria. It is a wake-up call of how technology can rapidly interrupt the assumed order within society. The issue is that it will be followed not only by advances in its own capabilities, but other technologies will follow in biotechnology, VR, nanotechnology etc. etc. etc. Are we on the edge of the greatest revolution to impact humans?"

        "title": "Bitcoin continues price rally, posts best January returns since 2013 - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has shown the highest return since October 2022 and has the best January in 10 years in monthly returns.\n\nSince the start of the year, BTC has enjoyed remarkable growth from $16,583.18 to $23,060.14 as of press time \u2013 amounting to about 39% return in 23 days.\n\nOver this month, the economy has grown across multiple sectors, with gold and the S&P500 up 19% and 13%, respectively, since last November. BTC has established itself as an important part of investment portfolios while experiencing outstanding price rallies.\n\nHowever, since the coin exceeded over $69k in November 2021, BTC has struggled for stability. For most of 2022, BTC plummeted owing to macro factors in the global market, insolvencies, and controversies rocked the industry. The coin with the highest market cap lost a significant portion of its value, dipping to $15,700 last November.\n\nPossible factors behind the recent price rally\n\nCrypto whales are likely behind the price surge, according to recent market research by Kaiko. As revealed, trade sizes have increased on Binance, which reflects that Whales are gaining confidence in the market.\n\nLikewise, inflation is slowing down in the U.S. after a series of combative measures from the Fed. The consumer price index decreased 0.1% in December every month, consistent with Dow Jones estimates.\n\nFurther, as bitcoin prices have dropped, several miners have been forced to leave the industry. Miners often accumulate massive amounts of digital currency, which makes them some of the biggest sellers. When miners sell off their bitcoin holdings to pay off debt, they remove much of the remaining selling pressure.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin\u2019s upcoming halving sometime between March and May 2024 could provide traders with some excitement for New Year\u2019s.\n\nWhat the Future holds\n\nWhile attention is presently on the next Fed meeting, experts are watchful that the outcome of the meeting can make or break the bull run of BTC. Due to next year\u2019s halving event for BTC, they believe things will improve for BTC in the future.\n\nWhen the halving events took place years ago, the price of BTC soared. The last event, which took effect in 2020, saw BTC soar from $8,821 to $10,943 within 150 days. Mostly, the crypto community viewed the halving event to have a remarkable impact on the price of BTC as it helps to contract supply and increase its value.\n\nProfessor Carol Alexander of the University of Sussex told CNBC in December that bitcoin will see a \u201cmanaged bull market\u201d in 2023, reaching $30,000 in the first quarter and $50,000 in the second.\n\nAccording to a CryptoSlate analysis of Bitcoin (BTC) metrics, the market has reached its bottom as investors continue accumulating BTC and pushing illiquid supply to 80%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current market cap stands at $445.58 billion \u2013 up from 407.38 billion a week ago."

        "content": "A key feature of the Bitcoin blockchain network (and all blockchains, for that matter) is that it is a public digital ledger, and all transaction data is publicly available. This allows Bitcoin to be fully decentralised.\n\nThe downside of this transparency, however, is that anyone can access and extract transaction data from the network. While there are internal protocols and privacy measures in place, as well as techniques like coin mixing that one could use to conceal transaction data, they aren't solid enough to prevent someone from acquiring and publishing it. One reason for implementing Taproot was to enhance the privacy and security of sensitive user data by allowing only essential transaction data to remain public.\n\n\n\nSpeed and performance were other issues with the Bitcoin network that Taproot aims to solve. The cryptographic signature technology that was used to record keys and signatures of transactions before Taproot had a longer commit time and took up more space on the network. The new Bitcoin Taproot signature (called Schnorr signature technology) aims to enhance speed and performance."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThough inflows into crypto products reached $37.3 million last week, more than two-thirds of that amount (68%) was into short investment products, digital asset investment firm CoinShares said in a new report Monday. Compared to the previous week, last week's total inflows are nearly four times as high.\n\nGermany and Switzerland led inflows in Europe ($14 million and $10 million, respectively), while Hong Kong, on the other hand, saw outflows from long investment products to the tune of $11 million.\n\nAmerican investors were the most skeptical, however, with 95% of inflows in the U.S. moving into short Bitcoin products.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoinShares\u2019 weekly reports cover investment inflows and outflows in popular ETPs, mutual funds, and over-the-counter (OTC) trusts referencing Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other altcoins. Importantly, these are not direct investments into the cryptocurrencies that these products represent.\n\nLast week also saw the trading volume for crypto investment products rise to $1.6 billion, which is above the 90-day average of $990 million, with total assets under management reaching $29 billion\u2014the highest since September last year.\n\nHowever, the devil is in the details, as the narrative is dominated by short-BTC inflows ($25.5 million), almost five times the inflow for long-BTC products, which accounted for a mere $5.7 million.\n\nThis represents the largest weekly inflow in short products since July 2022 ($51 million), the report continues.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSuch a picture is very much in line with the division of opinions within the crypto investor community.\n\nInvestors are split on whether the recent market\u2019s upward trend, which saw Bitcoin briefly surpass $23,000 over the weekend, is just the beginning of a new bull run, or a so-called \u201cbull trap.\u201d"

        "content": "Ether\u2019s (ETH) rally versus Bitcoin (BTC) is not only showing signs of exhaustion but is also in danger of breaking below a key technical support level.\n\nETH slides vs. BTC in the second half of January\n\nThe ETH/BTC pair declined nearly 9.25% on Jan. 24 from its local top of 0.0779 BTC established on Jan. 11. Since the start of the year, Bitcoin has been slightly outpacing Ether in terms of United States dollars, rising 38% versus 35%, respectively.\n\nETH/BTC daily candle price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nInterestingly, Ether\u2019s pullback versus Bitcoin has landed its price at the bottom of its EMA ribbon range, as shown below.\n\nETH/BTC weekly candle price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe EMA ribbon indicator shows numerous exponential moving averages of increasing timeframe on the same price chart. Dropping below the ribbon range increases an asset\u2019s likelihood of seeing an extended down-move.\n\nIn other words, breaking lower would increase its possibility of declining by more than 20% from its current price levels.\n\nConversely, rising above the ribbon range raises the asset\u2019s chances of a broader rally.\n\nEther\u2019s price capped by key descending trendline\n\nThis week, ETH/BTC dropped to the 55-week exponential moving average (the red wave) \u2014 a bottom wave \u2014 of its EMA ribbon indicator, as shown below. Buyers took control near the 55-week EMA, prompting Ether to recover a mere 0.35% versus Bitcoin to 0.0708 BTC on Jan. 24.\n\nRelated: This $25K BTC price target would spell misery for Bitcoin shorters\n\nBut now, the likelihood of retesting the EMA ribbon bottom is high due to a multi-month descending trendline resistance (black trendline in the chart below), where sellers have been more active as of late.\n\nETH/BTC weekly price chart focusing on descending trendline resistance. Source: TradingView\n\nTherefore, one cannot rule out the possibility of ETH/BTC breaking below the EMA ribbon range, similar to how the pair did in May 2022 in the wake of the Terra collapse.\n\nBack then, Ether fell by over 25% versus Bitcoin to 0.0490, a level coinciding with its 200-week EMA (the blue wave).\n\nTherefore, if a similar breakdown occurs in the coming weeks, the ETH/BTC pair may test the 200-week EMA near 0.0550 BTC as its primary downside target, or roughly a 20% price drop from current levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The podcasting revenue model is getting a Bitcoin facelift.\n\nLooking to expand its footprint beyond gaming, mobile payment firm ZEBEDEE announced Tuesday its partnership with the \u201clisten-to-earn\u201d podcast platform Fountain to give listeners and podcasters the ability to earn Bitcoin using the app.\n\n\u201cWith this partnership, we\u2019re supporting a new type of business model and economic activity, not just for the payments space, but in general,\u201d ZEBEDEE\u2019s chief strategy officer Ben Cousens said in a statement.\n\nLaunched in October 2019, ZEBEDEE is a Bitcoin-centric gaming firm that releases games through its mobile app. ZEBEDEE recently launched two new play-to-earn games, Bitcoin Chess and Bitcoin Scratch, a digital scratch-card game with mobile game studio Viker.\n\nWith play-to-earn games, a user plays online games and receives rewards with real-world value. Listen-to-earn aims to do something similar for podcasters, creating a direct link between podcasters and their audience and letting listeners earn Bitcoin for every minute they tune in.\n\nInstead of an expensive and sweeping ad campaign, the listen-to-earn model aims to only spend money on listeners who actually want to listen.\n\n\u201cWhen money moves as seamlessly as information, or in this case, audio, it just opens up a world of possibilities, and we\u2019re happy to be pioneering what that means in the podcasting space alongside Fountain,\u201d Cousens said.\n\nFountain, ZEBEDEE and \u2018listen-to-earn\u2019\n\nFountain launched its listen-to-earn program in June 2022.\n\nThe program allows listeners and podcasters to get rewarded for the value they provide. Fountain users will earn money for their first hour of daily podcast listening.\n\nTo draw in listeners, the platform uses RSS feeds to make podcasts from other platforms available to its listeners. Using the Fountain app to listen to their favorite podcast, users earn small amounts of Bitcoin, called sats or satoshis, after the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen the user is ready to cash out, they connect to the ZEBEDEE app to withdraw.\n\n\u201cThis type of Value for Value exchange is the future of content creation,\u201d Fountain\u2019s founder and CEO Oscar Merry said in a press release.\n\n\u201cA few years from now, we\u2019ll look back at when we paid subscriptions for content platforms that aren\u2019t related to how much we actually use those platforms and laugh at how basic and inefficient it was,\u201d he said."

        "title": "These 3 Stocks Don't Look Like Crypto Companies -- But They Are - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "When most people think of crypto companies, they typically think of cryptocurrency mining companies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and financial institutions heavily involved with crypto assets. However, there are a growing number of companies that have extensive exposure to crypto without many people even realizing it.\n\nOne way to find these crypto stocks is by checking out the official holdings of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that specialize in blockchain and crypto. For example, if you take a look at the holdings for the Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF (NYSEMKT: STCE), which launched in 2022, you can see a number of names that seem incongruous at first. Three names particularly stand out: MicroStrategy (MSTR 7.35%), Overstock.com (BYON 0.76%), and AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC -0.46%).\n\n1. MicroStrategy\n\nOn the surface, MicroStrategy looks just like a typical software analytics company. The company provides software solutions to a wide range of financial services, retail, healthcare, and technology companies. But what it is best known for is the extensive amount of Bitcoin (BTC 2.16%) it holds on its balance sheet. As of Dec. 27, MicroStrategy held 132,500 Bitcoins, now worth over $2.7 billion. Given that the total market cap of MicroStrategy is just over $2.5 billion, it is easy to see how buying this company's stock is really just a proxy for buying Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, the former CEO (and now executive chairman) of the company is none other than Michael Saylor, one of the biggest Bitcoin bulls in the world. On the MicroStrategy website, there's an orange Bitcoin button -- once you press it, you'll be redirected to a new site with a collection of videos from Saylor extolling the virtues of crypto and Bitcoin.\n\nSaylor has publicly predicted that the price of Bitcoin is going to $500,000, and he is positioning MicroStrategy to take advantage of this stratospheric new valuation. Until this year, it primarily meant accumulating more and more Bitcoin for the company. But in 2023, the company also plans to expand the number of software and enterprise infrastructure solutions it can provide related to the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which enables fast, secure, low-cost Bitcoin payments.\n\n2. Overstock.com\n\nIf you thought Overstock was just a discount retailer specializing in furniture and home furnishings, you would be mistaken. When it launched during the dot-com boom, Overstock.com made its name by becoming a high-profile e-commerce website where you could buy just about anything at significantly reduced prices. However, Overstock.com has embarked on a strategic overhaul in recent years that has often emphasized blockchain and crypto.\n\nThe first step occurred in 2014 when Overstock.com became the first major e-commerce site to accept Bitcoin. Then, in 2017, Overstock.com became the first major retailer to accept a wide range of altcoins, including Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE). Moreover, at about the same time, Overstock.com created a wholly owned subsidiary called Medici Ventures, which invests in blockchain and crypto companies. Prior investments have included start-ups that specialize in everything from crypto tokens to digital wallets.\n\n3. AMC Entertainment\n\nFinally, there's AMC Entertainment, which is more than just a movie theater chain these days. Quite simply, the company has realized that the previous generation of entertainment is coming to an end. So what do you do for an encore when people prefer to stream movies at home rather than go to the local cinema?\n\nThe answer, quite simply, is crypto. In 2021, the company announced it would begin accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment for movie tickets. In addition to Bitcoin, AMC Entertainment now accepts Dogecoin and Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) as a form of payment. And the company is also exploring a wide range of other initiatives related to film and cinema, including new NFT collections related to blockbuster films and possibly even a new crypto token tied to its business operations.\n\nHow to value these crypto companies?\n\nBefore you think about investing in these stocks just because they are \"crypto companies,\" just keep in mind how fiendishly hard it can be to value these stocks. In the example of MicroStrategy, nearly all of the company's valuation is tied up with Bitcoin, so it might not seem difficult. But what about Overstock.com and AMC Entertainment, where it is a lot harder to figure out how much of future cash flows are attributable to crypto?\n\nFor now, the only one of these crypto companies currently on my watchlist for 2023 is MicroStrategy, given its price has skyrocketed 74% since the end of December. It will be interesting to see how the company plans to offer new Bitcoin Lightning Network solutions to clients, and whether that can move the needle on Bitcoin's acceptance as an online payment solution.\n\nWhen I'm looking through the holdings of ETFs, that's the type of catalyst I would like to see. The next time you peruse the holdings of an ETF, look for an interesting company doing unexpected things in a hot niche or sector."

        "content": "BTC\u2019s MVRV rests above 1, indicating that t he market might have entered a bullish mid-term stage.\n\nOpen Interest has been on a steady increase since the year started.\n\nThe recent rally in Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] price in the last few weeks led to a sharp increase in the coin\u2019s market-value-to-realized-value ratio (MVRV), which according to CryptoQuant pseudonymous analyst Greatest Trader, implied that the market might have entered a bullish mid-term stage.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nGreatest Trader assessed BTC\u2019s price historical performance in the last four cycles and found that the king coin\u2019s MVRV fell below one during the bearish market phases, signifying that the coin was undervalued and a bear market bottom was in formation. Whenever the MVRV was pushed above one, \u201cBitcoin experienced a surge, and the bull market started,\u201d Greatest Trader found.\n\nA bull run was underway in the current market with the MVRV above one. But, according to Greatest Trader, the recent rally in price might be followed by \u201csudden moves and high volatility.\u201d\n\nWhat to expect in the short term?\n\nDaily chart assessment revealed bullish sentiment lingered in the BTC market and has so been since the year started. With increased coin accumulation in the past few weeks, BTC\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were both pegged at 84 at press time. At this spot, BTC was currently overbought.\n\nAdditionally, the coin\u2019s on-balance volume has risen consistently since the year began. At press time, this was 515,034. An upward trend in OBV suggests that the volume of buying is greater than the volume of selling, which is typically a bullish signal for the asset\u2019s price.\n\nFurther, the dynamic line (green) of the leading coin\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) rested above the center line at a positive 0.30 at press time. A rising positive CMF above the zero line is a sign of strength in the market.\n\nThe strength of the bullish trend in the BTC current market was confirmed by the position of the Average Directional Index (ADX). As of this writing, the ADX (yellow) was 51.\n\nWhen an asset\u2019s ADX is above 25, this indicates that the current market trend is strong. With an ADX of 51, the buyers\u2019 strength might become irrevocable by BTC sellers in the short term.\n\nLastly, BTC\u2019s Open Interest has been on a rally since the year started, data from CoinGlass revealed. At $11.13 billion at press time, BTC\u2019s Open Interest has risen by 21% since 1 January. A rising Open Interest is an indication of growing bullish sentiment, which further drives the growth of an asset\u2019s price."

        "content": "DUNDEE, Michigan (WTVG) - Internet scams can happen anywhere, even in a small town.\n\nPolice in Dundee, MI, say a 71-year-old man recently fell victim to a con that\u2019s making the rounds in our area. It started with a pop-up on the internet claiming to be from the man\u2019s bank. The message gave him a number to call.\n\nThe scammer then told the man his bank account was hacked, and that he needed to transfer out his money and convert it to Bitcoin to keep it safe.\n\n\u201cSo, he was asked to get out $15,000 two days in a row to basically empty out his savings account. He followed directions to go to a bitcoin machine in Dearborn, MI, where he deposited money over two days, and he was even warned by the scammer, \u2018If the bank asks you what you\u2019re doing, tell them you\u2019re making some home repairs.\u2019 Because they\u2019re telling him that a bank employee is actually involved with the hacking of his information,\u201d explained Acting Dundee Police Chief Lieutenant Randy Sehl.\n\nLt. Sehl said once that money was deposited in the foreign account, it was converted into digital currency. That made the cash in the machine obsolete and off-limits.\n\n\u201cWe asked why we couldn\u2019t get the money out of the machine. Actually, that\u2019s just an avenue for the money to go across seas. It\u2019s all electronically transferred once it\u2019s put in there. It\u2019s not really the machine or the owner of the machine\u2019s responsibility for that because the crime had already happened. So, we\u2019re working all avenues to try to get the money back, but it\u2019s not looking good right now,\u201d said Lt. Sehl.\n\nDundee Police are working with Homeland Security and the F.B.I. on the case.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has recently initiated an upward trend, breaking above key resistance levels and moving averages. In November 2022, BTC found support at the $16,000 level, and on January 12th and 13th, it has since surpassed the 100-day and 200-day moving averages at $18,000 and $19,600, respectively.\n\nThis is a significant bullish sign for the market as it suggests that adequate demand will likely return. However, there is also a bearish divergence between the price and the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily timeframe.\n\nThis particular technical pattern suggests that a correction will likely occur soon, which can guide traders in charting their next move. To stay responsive to chart movements, traders often use pivot points to evaluate probabilities and make quick decisions."

        "content": "Whole Foods\n\nWhole Foods is a grocery store chain that specialises in natural and organic products. In 2019, it announced that it would begin accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies at certain store locations via the Flexa app.\n\nThis move enabled customers to use their digital assets to purchase groceries at Whole Foods, expanding the use cases for cryptocurrency beyond speculative investments.\n\nTesla\n\nTesla is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles, renewable energy, and energy storage. In 2021, it announced that it would begin accepting payments in Bitcoin for its products.\n\nThis move positions Tesla as one of the first major companies to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, and it could potentially lead to more widespread adoption of cryptocurrency in the retail industry.\n\nRakuten\n\nRakuten is a Japanese e-commerce giant that accepts multiple cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Ripple.\n\nIt is one of the most famous online retailers in Japan, and accepting cryptocurrency enables it to cater to the growing number of cryptocurrency holders in Japan and around the world. It also helps Rakuten to be at the forefront of innovation and technology.\n\nNewegg\n\nNewegg is an online retailer that specializes in computer hardware and consumer electronics. In August 2014, Newegg announced that it would begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment on its website.\n\nNewegg accepts Bitcoin through a partnership with BitPay, a cryptocurrency payment processor.\n\nWhy are retailers accepting cryptocurrency?\n\nThere are several reasons why retailers are beginning to accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment.\n\nFirst, cryptocurrency offers a fast, secure, and decentralized method of payment. Transactions made with cryptocurrency are processed almost instantly and are secure due to the use of cryptography.\n\nSecond, cryptocurrency can help retailers reach a wider audience. As more and more people begin to use and invest in cryptocurrency, retailers who accept it as a form of payment can tap into this growing market.\n\nThird, accepting cryptocurrency can help retailers save on transaction fees. Traditional payment methods, such as credit cards, often come with high transaction fees. In contrast, many cryptocurrency payment processors charge lower fees.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, more retailers are beginning to accept it as a form of payment. Overstock.com, Expedia, Microsoft, Dell, and Newegg are among the well known retailers that now accept payments in cryptocurrency.\n\nRetailers are accepting cryptocurrency because it offers a fast, secure, and decentralised method of payment that can help them reach a wider audience and can help them save on transaction fees.\n\nAs more retailers begin to accept cryptocurrency, it is likely that we will see even more widespread adoption of this digital currency."

Investing in Bitcoin now is a good idea because the price can rise considerably in the coming years. In addition, the tax benefits associated with holding Bitcoin are very attractive.

It is difficult to predict what will happen in the future. However, it is important to note that the crypto-currency market is very volatile and there can be significant ups and downs. Therefore, it is important to make careful and well thought out investment decisions.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin now is a good idea because it is a crypto-currency with great potential. It is a great way to diversify your portfolio as it offers many benefits, including greater security and lower transaction fees. In addition, it is considered by many financial experts as a good long-term investment opportunity. As far as buying Bitcoin in January 2023 is concerned, it depends on your financial situation and risk level. If you are looking for a long-term investment, then buying Bitcoin in January 2023 may be a good option. If you are looking for a short-term investment, then you are better off investing now, in order to take advantage of the increase in value of Bitcoin.\n\n5 reasons why Bitcoin is a high-potential cryptocurrency in 2023\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is the largest and oldest crypto asset, which makes it exceptionally trusted and well-known.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin has a limited supply (maximum of 21 million coins), which makes it valuable and rare.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is highly liquid and can be exchanged for all major fiat and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is regularly updated and improved by the open source community, making it a safe long-term investment.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is decentralized, which means it is not controlled by a central authority and is therefore immune to political manipulation.\n\nBitcoin is one of the most promising and high potential cryptocurrencies for the year 2023. There are many reasons why Bitcoin is a crypto-currency with high potential. First of all, Bitcoin is one of the most popular and widely used crypto-currencies, which makes it a great choice for investors. In addition, Bitcoin is backed by state-of-the-art technology that makes it very safe and secure. In addition, the cryptocurrency market is growing rapidly and Bitcoin is at the forefront of this movement. Finally, Bitcoin has a large ecosystem of users that support its long-term growth. Considering all these reasons, it is clear that Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency with great potential and it would be wise to invest in Bitcoin in January 2023.\n\nHow can I buy Bitcoin at no cost?\n\nJanuary 2023 is an interesting date to buy Bitcoin. However, the best way to buy Bitcoin without fees is to do so on a reliable online exchange platform, which allows you to buy and sell digital currencies without fees. Also, by always checking the terms and conditions and fees associated with the exchange, you will be able to buy Bitcoin at no extra cost. Once you have found a reliable platform such as Blackbull, you can buy Bitcoin using payment methods like bank transfers, credit cards or even digital wallets. Finally, if you want to buy Bitcoin in January 2023, you need to make sure that you have chosen the right platform and that you are aware of the fees and risks involved in investing.\n\nOnce you buy Bitcoin, you'll need to store it safely. The best way to do this is to use a digital wallet that can be downloaded to your computer or mobile device. You can also use a hardware wallet which is a physical device that stores your private keys and allows you to transfer and receive Bitcoins. In addition, you can choose to invest in Bitcoin investment funds that are professionally managed and aim to invest in Bitcoin-related businesses. Finally, before you jump into Bitcoin investing, make sure you understand the risks and opportunities associated with this currency.\n\nOnce you have safely stored your Bitcoin, you can start using it to make transactions. There are many platforms and apps that allow you to buy, sell and transfer Bitcoins. You can also use wallet and exchange services to store and trade your Bitcoins. It is important to note that Bitcoin transactions are usually irreversible, so it is important to make sure that you are transacting with reliable people and services. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is very volatile, and prices can fluctuate significantly from day to day.\n\nWhy buy CFD bitcoin?\n\nCFDs, or Contracts for Difference, allow traders to speculate on the price of an asset, such as bitcoin, without actually owning the underlying asset. This can be beneficial for several reasons, such as the ability to go short and profit from bitcoin price decrease, or the ability to trade with leverage, which can amplify potential profits. However, it's important to note that CFDs also amplify potential losses and can be a high-risk investment.\n\nChoose Blackbull to buy bitcoin\n\nBlackbull is a trading platform that allows individuals to buy and sell various assets, including bitcoin. One of the main benefits of using Blackbull to buy bitcoin is that the platform provides a user-friendly interface that is accessible to both experienced and novice traders. Blackbull also offers a variety of features such as social trading, where users can copy the trades of other successful traders, and a virtual trading feature, which allows users to practice trading with virtual money before investing real funds. Additionally, Blackbull is a regulated platform, which can provide users with an added layer of security. However, it's important to keep in mind that Blackbull is not available in all countries and it's always recommended to research and understand the risks before investing.

        "title": "Promising Future of Bitcoin Experts Foresees It Eventually Replacing Fiat Money - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Looking at the promising value of BTC, experts foresee bitcoin replacing fiat money for trading before 2040.\n\nAlthough it is exceedingly impossible to predict the coin\u2019s value thus far in advance, a number of events could significantly alter the structure of the cryptocurrency markets. The digital token Bitcoin really does have the chance to surpass fiat money (global banking) in just under three decades, according to pioneers of the crypto industry. Further optimistic experts foresee bitcoin replacing fiat money by 2040. The most well-known cryptocurrency in the market, Bitcoin, routinely sets new price records! The coin collection peaked on November 10, 2021, at $68789.63. the $66,930.39 mark set on October 20, 2021. Following BTC\u2019s milestone, large cryptocurrency whales are snatching coins faster, increasing demand for BTC while simultaneously reducing supply, which is causing BTC to rise.\n\nOne of the best investment opportunities available now is Bitcoin. Many people continue to think they can make enormous profits when they invest in Bitcoin, despite the fact that the price can change dramatically. Based on prior Bitcoin price forecasts for 2022 and earlier seasons, experts believe in the promising future of bitcoin.\n\nLong-term favorable conditions are predicted by the technical analysis of the USD and Bitcoin markets. The forecast chart also indicates that a foundation is emerging for the bullish market, which has a goal value of about 100,000 USD. We can anticipate a return to the flag\u2019s lateral edge at 70,000 USD since Bitcoin is now selling at its lower limit. Such movements can unquestionably be seen as the start of a bullish trend on a lesser TF chart, which may last until the winter.\n\nSince the time of BTCs inception, three key factors have influenced the price of bitcoin.\n\nSupply Level- Bitcoin has one distinctive quality all its own: a finite supply. Only 21 Bitcoin units were ever created, and there are presently 20 million available for use. According to some experts, the market demand is still increasing even while the supply is fixed. Other analysts argued that because Bitcoin is in such short supply and individuals are vying for ownership, it is preferable. People buy Bitcoin while also taking psychological aspects into account.\n\nHigh Adoption of Bitcoin- The rising adoption rate is yet another important element driving up the price of bitcoin. According to bitcoin expert Kate Waltman, many people are now prepared to buy and experience the amazing world of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, cryptocurrency technology is gaining traction more quickly than people did when the internet initially emerged. With that hypothesis, the high rate of adoption of this cryptocurrency will raise the price of Bitcoin even more. Statistics from a digital firm that manages assets show that annual growth in Bitcoin adoption has been 113%.\n\nHalving: A process called halving is one of the key drivers of the current increase in the price of bitcoins. A computational attempt to reduce the number of circulating coins by 50 percent is called halving.\n\nConclusion\n\nAnalysts and spectators indicate that Bitcoin will continue to rise in value. In 2023, there is still an opportunity for Bitcoin. However, nobody is able to predict with certainty what will happen to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies this year. Nevertheless, despite its extreme fluctuation, Bitcoin has continued to be one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in over the long run, similar to earlier years.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Low demand for leverage gives insights into the current Bitcoin investor psychology.\n\nBTC enjoys demand in the derivatives market courtesy of a strong recovery in open interest.\n\nGlassnode alerts just revealed that the amount of HODLed or lost Bitcoin is now at a 5-year high. This reflects the positive price action that the cryptocurrency has delivered in the last few weeks. This means BTC investors have been accumulating but despite this, leverage has been on a decline.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nBitcoin trading with leverage gained popularity in the last few years. A great tool for traders when the market is going their way but not so much when things go sideways.\n\nMany crypto traders have unfortunately suffered huge losses in the 2022 bear market and even during the current recovery. This is why it is interesting to see lower demand for leverage despite heavy HODLing.\n\n? #Bitcoin $BTC Amount of HODLed or Lost Coins just reached a 5-year high of 7,562,069.403 BTC Previous 5-year high of 7,561,969.550 BTC was observed on 04 November 2022 View metric:https://t.co/dJK8rxBVD3 pic.twitter.com/9PLAK2TH8i \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) January 22, 2023\n\nBitcoin\u2019s estimated leverage ratio has been declining since the end of December 2022. The last time it was as low as it currently is was in May 22. But what does this really mean for the market?\n\nIt suggests that more BTC investors are opening their eyes to the risks associated with leverage. Especially considering the highly volatile and uncertain nature of the crypto market.\n\nThis might actually be a good thing for BTC holders because it means there is not a heavy risk of leverage-induced liquidation. The liquidation of heavily leveraged trades is among the reasons why many have lost their BTC holdings in the past.\n\nBitcoin bulls are still dominant but for how long?\n\nBitcoin is still experiencing healthy demand, especially from the derivatives segment despite the lower demand for leverage. Open interest bottomed out just after mid-December after which a bullish pivot was observed. This might be a sign that investors in the segment, especially institutional buyers have also been accumulating.\n\nThe BTC bulls are starting to experience an increase in friction despite this demand from the derivatives market. A good example of this is the pivot we observed on the Bitcoin exchange reserve metric which suggests that there might be some incoming sell pressure. Unsurprisingly, exchange inflows outweighed exchange outflows at press time.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nExchange flows have notably decreased in the last few days, which suggests that buying pressure might be losing its momentum. This means profit-taking may pave the way for an influx of sell pressure, especially after the rally in the last three weeks.\n\nWhat to expect?\n\nNow that the bulls are slowing down, the expectations of some retracement are notably higher. However, the low leverage may indicate that many BTC holders have a long-term bias, thus the low focus on leveraged trades. A potential implication is that we may see a weak retracement."

        "content": "When we're talking about the value of any cryptocurrency, we have to take into account the idea that we're dealing with largely unregulated market action. Anyone can pretty much say anything they want about Bitcoin in any sort of public forum, and no government will have the authority to tell them to stop. For example, a tweet shared by CryptoWhale this week suggested that he'd give $1,000 to anyone who retweeted his message if Bitcoin's value did not hit $10,000 by the end of 2022. This is the sort of thing that could be the basis of a legal investigation if it were tied to a regulated stock.\n\nOf course, this sort of public influence has been the subject of some major legal action in the recent past. Elon Musk's tweets about Tesla were the subject of some SEC scrutiny in 2019, and in 2022 his purchase agreement with Twitter has already landed him in trouble since the agreement said he's not to \"disparage the Company or any of its Representatives\" in his tweets about the deal. Neither Bitcoin nor any other cryptocurrency has such protection.\n\nElon Musk or any other major influencer can tweet about Bitcoin all day long, regardless of how much they have invested in the coin at any given time. If Elon Musk says something on Twitter about Tesla, Tesla's value on the stock market could fall, and Musk's associations with Dogecoin could make the value of the dog-themed coin fall. If Elon Musk announces that Tesla is no longer accepting Bitcoin payments, the entire cryptocurrency market falls."

        "content": "With the expansion of the cryptocurrency sector, mining Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming increasingly mainstream, and the construction of the first nuclear-powered data center in the United States that is expected to host Bitcoin mining services has recently been completed.\n\nIndeed, a zero-carbon data center manufacturer Cumulus Data, a subsidiary of an independent power producer Talen Energy, has completed the powered shell for its first data center powered by a 2.5-gigawatt nuclear power station, World Nuclear News reported on January 18.\n\nThe 48-megawatt, 300,000-square-foot data center is directly connected to the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in northeast Pennsylvania, and its 1,200-acre campus is expected to host Bitcoin mining and cloud computing services \u2013 the first of its kind in the U.S.\n\nSolving the energy \u2018trilemma\u2019\n\nCommenting on the development, Cumulus Data and Talen Energy CEO Alex Hernandez said:\n\n\u201cOur flagship Cumulus Susquehanna data center campus is positioned to welcome its first tenant and commence commercial operations this year. We look forward to advancing our mission to solve the energy \u2018trilemma\u2019, which we define as the rapidly increasing consumer demand for zero-carbon, low-cost, and reliable electricity by data center customers.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, on top of this 48-megawatt powered shell, two additional ones are in advanced development in phase 1 of the project, with a planned aggregate capacity for the campus of 475 megawatts. Cumulus Data had also identified another 18 Talen Energy sites with the potential for data centers directly connected to the power station.\n\nThe development of the zero-carbon Bitcoin mining facility called the Nautilus Cryptomine at the campus was first announced in August 2021, when Talen Energy signed a deal for a joint venture with a U.S.-based cryptocurrency mining firm TeraWulf.\n\nAlthough the operations on the construction of the Bitcoin mine were briefly suspended in early December last year, TeraWulf recently said it was in the early phase of ramping up its mining operations, for which it expects to provide 50 megawatts of net mining capacity in Q1 2023.\n\nEnvironmentally friendly Bitcoin mining\n\nIn another low-cost Bitcoin mining effort, the Virunga National Park in eastern Congo is mining Bitcoin using hydro-electricity to provide the necessary funding to protect the forests and wildlife in Africa\u2019s oldest protected park, affected by years of militia violence, deforestation, and poor government assistance.\n\nZero-carbon Bitcoin mining is possible using sunlight as well, with the help of solar panels. In order to successfully operate this way, an Antiminer S19, which uses 72 kWh per day, would require a 14 kWh solar system, or about 35 standard 400-watt solar panels.\n\nIn March 2022, Finbold also reported on Peter Egyed, also known as AZ Hodl, installing an off-grid solar array for his Bitcoin mining operation, for which he expected to make a return on investment (ROI) within 36 months."

The data center is powered by a direct link to the Susquehanna nuclear power station, which has a capacity of 2.5 gigawatts.\n\nNuclear power has the potential to become a significant source of electricity for the bitcoin mining sector.\n\nBy providing stable, carbon-free electricity, nuclear reactors will contribute in sustaining the cryptocurrency ecosystem, fostering its expansion, and accelerating the mainstream adoption of bitcoin assets.\n\nA rendering from 2021 of the data center campus next to the Susquehanna power plant (Image: Linxon/World Nuclear News)\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty jumped 10.26% to a new all-time high of 37.59 trillion on Monday, as some U.S.-based mining enterprises resumed operations after being knocked offline by snow cyclones.\n\nGlobally, cryptocurrency mining requires enormous quantities of electricity. According to one analyst, it consumes 77.78 TWh of energy, which is similar to Chile\u2019s energy demand.\n\nThose nuclear power plants that are unable to dispose of 100 percent of their electricity can use the excess energy for crypto mining to aid in the decarbonizing process of the sector, which environmental activists have long clamored for.\n\nBitcoin Mining Center Ready To Accept Tenants\n\nThis year, Cumulus Data CEO Alex Hernandez said the flagship Susquehanna data center site will accept its first subscriber and begin commercial operations.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to advancing our goal of solving the energy \u2018trilemma\u2019 which we define as the rapidly increasing consumer demand for zero-carbon, low-cost, and reliable electricity by data center customers,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nTalen Energy announced in 2021 a partnership with the American bitcoin mining company TeraWulf to construct the Nautilus Cryptomine on the site.\n\nTeraWulf stated in a recent update that it was in the in the first phases of kickstarting its mining process and anticipated that the cryptomine would deliver 50-megawatts of total mining output to TeraWulf in the first quarter this year.\n\nEven though it may seem strange to attach a cryptocurrency data center to a nuclear power facility, CO2 emissions and rising electricity costs are becoming extremely important considerations for companies with extensive data center infrastructure.\n\nNuclear power plants provide a steady, zero-carbon energy source.\n\nBTC total market cap at $445 trillion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com\n\nNuclear Power & Bitcoin Mining: A Perfect Pair\n\nThe unique value proposition for both sectors is made possible by the confluence of surplus and carbon-free, nuclear-generated electricity.\n\nNot only will nuclear reactors develop a new revenue stream by mining cryptocurrency, but they will also assist in decarbonizing an industry and increase bitcoin\u2019s appeal to a large group of institutional investors with environmental, social, and governance aspirations.\n\nVladimir Galabov, director of cloud and data center research at Omdia, stated:\n\n\u201cNuclear power has its place in supporting the data center cut its greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\n\nAs the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $23,091, up 9.1% in the last seven days, data by Coingecko show.\n\nFeatured image from Cryptoslate"

        "content": "As technology and the cryptocurrency industry progress, new options become available to earn digital assets, including generating Bitcoin (BTC) by playing video games, and one developer has upgraded his vintage Nintendo console to generate the decentralized finance (DeFi) asset while playing Super Mario.\n\nSpecifically, Christian Moss, developer and co-founder at Zebedee (ZBD), a Bitcoin-powered platform that allows developers to put money in their games and gamers to earn money by playing them, has upgraded his original Nintendo to do just this, as he demonstrated in a video posted on January 23.\n\nWith @zebedeeio you can put bitcoin into anything!\n\nIn preparation for @advbitcoin I wanted to see if I could add bitcoin into a Super Mario running on my original NES, every time you get a coin it sends you some sats! pic.twitter.com/KPIvO09oo7 \u2014 Christian Moss (@MandelDuck) January 23, 2023\n\nHow it went\n\nAs Moss started playing Super Mario Bros. 3 on his Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) upgraded via Zebedee, the game sent him 10 satoshis or \u2018sats\u2019 (the atomic unit of Bitcoin) each time he scored a coin in the game, as evidenced in the split-screen video of the game and his phone payment notifications.\n\nTaking into account that 100 million satoshis equal one Bitcoin (10 sats = 0.0000001 BTC or $0.002299 at press time), this would be a slow, albeit very fun, way to generate a profitable amount of the maiden digital asset, especially if the game is among one\u2019s favorites.\n\nIn the comments to the video, Moss gave a tip to a fellow Bitcoin Gameboy game developer on how to implement the system, stressing that, if the game can do basic HTTP requests, then it would be easy to send sats with the Zebedee API.\n\nThe developer also said he would be presenting his project at the Bitcoin-exclusive conference Advancing Bitcoin, which is set to take place on March 2-3 in London, promising to write a detailed tutorial for anyone interested in repeating his experiment.\n\nSimilar endeavors\n\nInterestingly, this isn\u2019t the first time someone has enabled a video game console to earn cryptocurrency. In late March 2021, Finbold reported on a pseudonymous vlogger who modded his Nintendo Game Boy to enable it to mine Bitcoin, after failing to find an appropriate graphics processing unit (GPU) in stores.\n\nHis solution was to connect the Game Boy to a computer using Raspberry Pi Pico through the console\u2019s link port, normally used to perform Pok\u00e9mon trading and other things. The Raspberry Pi Pico allowed him to build an adapter from a link cable to USB. That said, the game console could only pump out 0.8 hashes per second."

This currency was said to have been invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, although the real name of its inventor remains in the dark. The core idea behind Bitcoin is to provide users with almost complete anonymity with each transaction.\n\nThe key thing that you have to realize about Bitcoin is that it doesn\u2019t have a physical form; only balances that are safeguarded on a public ledger which is accessible by everyone. Bitcoins are not associated or backed by any bank or government, which makes it particularly appealing for players that can\u2019t use traditional payment methods in real-money poker sites due to governmental restrictions.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to get down to the nitty-gritty of all the technicalities involved with Bitcoin, because it may be a bit overwhelming. And honestly, you don\u2019t need to worry yourself with learning all the terminology in order to use Bitcoin for playing online poker. So, we\u2019ll show you straight away how to deposit and withdraw Bitcoin on poker sites.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning the mechanics of Bitcoin, here\u2019s a handy video that could help you get familiar with the subject.\n\nWeUseCoins\n\n\n\nHow Do Bitcoins Work?\n\nIt\u2019s quite a simple procedure of buying and selling bitcoins using regular money from the currency of your choice. Namely, there are multiple services which can be accessed online, offering bitcoins for sale.\n\nThe interesting segment about this phenomenon is how to explain its value. Overall, one can perceive at as intrinsic value, interconnected with the actual bitcoin. Just like anything else on the market, it can fluctuate in regards to its supply and demand ratio.\n\nTypes of Bitcoin Poker Rooms\n\nThere are three types of poker rooms which allow players to participate with bitcoin as a currency.\n\nThe first type is bitcoin-only poker sites. These are specialized poker sites which only allow players who use bitcoin as a method of payment. Here, there is no other option, which is why there are no currency convertors. In this line of thought, there is not fee for conversion as well. The second type is bitcoin-inclusive poker sites, as these online poker rooms have the standard array of accepted currencies, but they also accept players who use bitcoins. A convertor is provided here, as bitcoins understandably vary in value from one currency to the next. As for the final type, it\u2019s important that you know how bitcoins are actually kept and stored. Namely, e-wallets have been present for quite some time in this field, which makes them a familiar term by now. Considering their digital \u2018physique\u2019, bitcoins are stored in such e-wallets. Hence, there are also poker rooms which allow bitcoins as a payment method, but only through Neteller.\n\nHow to Use Bitcoin on Online Poker Sites \u2014 Step-by-Step Guide\n\nRegister on a Crypto Exchange Platform In order to use BTCs on poker sites, you must obtain them first.

The procedure may seem daunting, but after a while, you\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s actually easier to withdraw from poker sites using Bitcoin than the traditional credit card or wire transfer.\n\nAdvantages of Using Bitcoin for playing Online Poker\n\nUsingcan seem a bit complex for beginners, but in reality, it\u2019s easy as pie. We\u2019ll walk you through the entire process.\n\nAlthough certain skeptics may appear a bit surprised by the end of this list, the use of bitcoin does have a beneficial effect. To be quite frank, using Bitcoin in poker sites is not all roses. But let me assure you that there isn\u2019t such a thing as a perfect payment method \u2014 they all have their own pros and cons.\n\nCompared to other payment providers, Bitcoin is vastly beneficial to poker players and I\u2019m going to explain why.\n\nEasier Accessibility Poker is a part of the heavily regulated online gambling industry. In most countries in the world, gambling laws are strict, and not everyone has the luxury of being able to access their favorite poker rooms. US poker fans certainly know what I\u2019m talking about. Even if you manage to find a poker site that accepts players from your country, or go to an offshore-based poker site, you may not be able to deposit funds to it. For instance, most banks in the US will not authorize payments targeted towards out-of-state regulated poker sites. By using Bitcoin, you can circumvent these nagging restrictions. As we said earlier, Bitcoin is not subject to any governmental or banking laws. That means that if you manage to find a Bitcoin poker site, there is no law or regulation that could prevent you from making a deposit.\n\nUnrivaled Anonymity Bitcoin is tailor-made for the poker industry due to the level of anonymity it provides. Some of the finest poker sites prioritize anonymity and that gives them the edge over their competitors. Privacy is much sought-after by undercover poker players. It allows them to win real money at poker tables without revealing their real name and address. Not only does Bitcoin provide anonymity at the poker table, but it also allows players to transfer winnings to a bank account without having to elaborate where they came from. This is particularly beneficial for those living in countries where gambling winnings are taxable.\n\nLow to Non-Existent Fees decentralized digital currency, and as such, allow players and poker operators to transfer value directly. This eliminates the need for the middle man to take their cut. Therefore, the fees are lower. It\u2019s a win-win situation for everyone. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, were created as adigital currency, and as such, allow players and poker operators to transfer value directly. This eliminates the need for the middle man to take their cut. Therefore, the fees are lower. It\u2019s a win-win situation for everyone. Transferring bitcoin to real-money poker sites might only involve mining fees, which are quite low. Or in some instances, the poker operator itself may charge a fee. But generally, Bitcoin fees are much lower compared to those of traditional payment methods.\n\nTop-Notch Safety Due to its cryptographic nature, Bitcoin is probably safer than traditional payment methods. Bitcoin transactions are verified and encrypted several times at various points on the network. Furthermore, once you make your Bitcoin deposit on a real-money poker site, the funds will go directly into cold storage with keys that are kept safely offline and away from prying eyes. I have yet to hear about a major theft on a Bitcoin poker site.\n\nUndeniably Fair Putting your faith in a poker operator may be easier said than done, especially if you\u2019ve heard of all those rogue platforms where players got ripped off. As a player, how can you be sure that the flop, the turn, or the river aren\u2019t rigged in favor of the poker site? That\u2019s where BTC poker sites come into play. Bitcoin and crypto gambling sites use algorithms for generating odds that are provably fair, courtesy of blockchain technology \u2014 the underlying technology of all cryptocurrencies. All the top poker sites integrate provably fair features to ensure that their games are genuinely fair and random.\n\nDisadvantages of Using Bitcoin for Playing Online Poker\n\nBitcoin is slowly gaining momentum in the poker industry, but it has not yet been adopted by all the biggest poker sites. That means that the number of Bitcoin-friendly poker platforms is still limited.\n\nAnother drawback of using Bitcoin in online gambling is that its value is widely unstable and unpredictable. This may not present an obstacle for casual players, but for high stakes players, it can be a deal-breaker.\n\nLast but not least, you can only access Bitcoin physically from whatever device you\u2019re using. What this means is that Bitcoins could get permanently lost in case of a hard drive crash, or if your device gets stolen. With no way of getting them back, you could lose a massive amount of money in only a few seconds.\n\nBitcoin Poker Sites vs. Real-Money Poker Sites\n\nThere are several differences between Bitcoin and traditional payment methods, such as credit/debit cards and e-wallets. For one, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are not dependent on banks like e-wallets, for example.\n\nBitcoin uses wallets, which are similar in concept to your e-banking or PayPal/Skrill/Neteller wallet. The big difference between using a Bitcoin wallet and a payment provider like PayPal is that the latter is tied to a bank account, which means that it\u2019s more prone to hacker attacks and account freezes.\n\nAlso, Bitcoin fees are much lower than fees associated with using credit and debit cards on poker sites, or even e-wallets, for that matter.\n\nAnother difference is seen in the speed of transactions. Bitcoin transactions are lightning-fast, even when withdrawing funds from poker sites, which isn\u2019t the case with all payment methods, particularly bank wire transfers that take several working days to process.\n\nConclusion\n\nThat\u2019s it guys \u2014 you now have the knowledge to use Bitcoin in online poker sites. It has a bit of a learning curve, no doubt about it. The upside is that, once you get the hang of it, it\u2019s actually one of the most straightforward payment methods, with a lot less friction than credit card or wire transfer.\n\nSince there aren\u2019t many Bitcoin poker sites to choose from, it may be easier for you to simply pick one from my site. All of my picks are reliable and safe, and I\u2019ve been using these poker sites myself for years now.\n\nIf I can be of assistance with anything else, feel free to contact me \u2014 I\u2019ll be more than willing to help you out.
