        "title": "Bitcoin is already up 50% this year \u2014 beating stocks and gold - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nFilip Radwanski | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin is up 50% this year despite the collapse of major crypto-focused banks, beating major stock indexes and commodities. On Jan. 1, bitcoin began trading at just over $16,500. On Wednesday, it was hovering around the $25,000 mark, thanks to a rally that began on Sunday. The surge in price this year comes after bitcoin crashed 65% in 2022 after a number of major collapses of projects and hedge funds, bankruptcies, liquidity issues and the failure of FTX, one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges. The recent rise has come as somewhat of a surprise, given the closure of Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank, two of the biggest lenders to the crypto industry. And Silicon Valley Bank, viewed as the backbone of the technology startup industry, also failed.\n\n\"Bitcoin's 50% surge in 2023 is a reflection of how beaten down it was post the FTX collapse, the changing interest rate outlook and the failure (& resurrection) of SVB,\" Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto trading platform Nexo, told CNBC. From its peak of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, bitcoin is still down more than 60%. Here are some of the main reasons bitcoin is up.\n\nBank collapses\n\nWhile the collapse of Silvergate, Signature Bank and SVB sent shockwaves through financial markets, bitcoin's rebound could also be fueled by those very failures, according to Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno. \"This past week's events around the failure of SVB and other banks have also shone a spotlight on the power of decentralised currencies that people can fully custody and own,\" Ayyar said. \"Decentralised finance is beginning to hit home in terms of a concept to many more people now.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nBitcoin is called a decentralized currency because it isn't issued by a single entity like a central bank. Instead, it relies on an underlying technology called blockchain and its network is maintained by a community. U.S. regulators had to step in to guarantee customer deposits at these banks, however. Nexo's Trenchev said the intervention \"reminded investors about the structural deficiencies of the U.S. banking system and the U.S. dollar underpinning it, reasons why we've seen a flight to Bitcoin this week.\" Bitcoin proponents have claimed the digital currency is a way for investors to protect themselves against central bank moves, particularly quantitative easing and looser monetary policy, which they say erodes the value of fiat currency. Proponents point to bitcoin's finite supply as a key feature of it being a store of value.\n\nInterest rate outlook\n\nThe bank collapses came after a year of interest rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve. SVB's issue was that it had to sell off assets, mainly Treasurys, to shore up its balance sheet as depositors withdrew funds. But it sold those assets at a hefty loss because interest rate rises had pushed the price of Treasurys lower. Some analysts have suggested the stress on the financial sector could slow down the pace of rate hikes from the Fed, which could help risk assets, such as stocks and bitcoin. That came even after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said days before the bank collapses that rates are likely to be higher than policymakers anticipated.\n\n\"In the space of a few days we'd turned from a hawkish Powell to an environment where economists were predicting the Fed might not even hike rates in March, benefiting Bitcoin,\" Trenchev said. \"It's been said that the Fed will only stop hiking rates when they break something, and now that something is broken, attention has turned to Bitcoin.\"\n\nBitcoin vs. stocks"

        "title": "Is Bitcoin a Safe-Haven Asset Now? Recent Data and Market Experts Say Yes - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC 1.63%) has been a hot topic in the financial world for years, with opinions about the cryptocurrency running the gamut from a \"revolutionary new asset class\" to a \"dangerous speculative bubble.\" One thing that most experts can agree on, however, is that its volatility has historically made it a less-than-ideal safe-haven asset. But recent market movements seemed to have changed that tune. There are fewer sad trombones and more sparkly vibraphone grooves in the Bitcoin canticle nowadays.\n\nBut is the cryptocurrency really ready to serve as a long-term vault for your hard-earned wealth? Let's look closer at Bitcoin's suitability for that august role in light of recent data and expert analyses.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nBitcoin has been on a tear since the beginning of 2023, rising 45% since the start of the year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.19%) index is up by a mere 0.8% over the same period, and gold has gained 2.6%.\n\nZooming out to a three-year view, you'll find that Bitcoin has outperformed the traditional safe havens of gold and broad stock market indexes again. This time, gold is up by 19%. The S&P 500's dividend-adjusted total return stops at 49%. Over the same span, Bitcoin soared 367% higher.\n\nAnd if you allow me to go back six years instead, incorporating the surge of 2017 and the 2018 crypto winter into the data, we can see how a $10,000 investment in Bitcoin has performed against gold and the S&P 500 since the spring of 2017:\n\nOf course, past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, and its value could plummet just as quickly as it has risen. The chart above, impressive as it is, also shows many dramatic price drops over the years.\n\nBut it seems that Bitcoin has finally established itself as a contender in the category of safe-haven assets. As investors seek out alternatives to traditional value stores, like precious metals or diverse stock market indexes, Bitcoin's unique characteristics and limited supply could make it an attractive option for those looking to protect their wealth against inflation and currency fluctuations.\n\nAnd that's right in line with the original intentions of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's unknown inventor (or group of inventors). The cryptocurrency was designed to resist inflation through a lifetime maximum of 21 million digital coins, and 19.3 million of them are already minted. This capped long-term supply is similar to the limited amount of gold on the planet, which is why Bitcoin bulls often refer to it as \"digital gold.\"\n\nExpert analysis\n\nDespite its volatility, some market experts believe that Bitcoin could continue to serve as a safe-haven asset in the future. Beyond the gold-like supply-and-demand equation, some Bitcoin gurus point to the growing interest from institutional investors and large corporations. As a result, the cryptocurrency may be becoming more mainstream and accepted as a legitimate asset class.\n\nIn fact, companies like Tesla (TSLA -4.54%) and Block (SQ 4.91%) have even added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, further signaling their confidence in the cryptocurrency. Taking that idea to its next logical step, business software builder MicroStrategy (MSTR 10.85%) has converted most of its cash reserves into Bitcoin -- and keeps buying more coins financed by a combination of cash flows, loans, and stock sales.\n\ndeVere Group CEO Nigel Green calls the current banking crisis a \"springboard event\" for Bitcoin as traditional-minded investors start to treat the digital asset as a safe port in the storm. The financial shake-up may inspire others to follow in the steps of Tesla, Block, and MicroStrategy. Massive long-term inflation of the U.S. dollar is a critical part of this scenario: \"Investors are therefore looking for alternative currencies, such as cryptocurrencies,\" Green writes in a recent press release. \"Moving forward, these will increasingly compete with traditional, fiat ones, and this will help trigger the decreasing dominance of currently leading international currencies.\"\n\nWhat's next for Bitcoin holders with \"diamond hands\"?\n\nNobody knows for sure where Bitcoin is going next. The crypto winter may be thawing as we speak, or another cold snap could bring Bitcoin prices down again in 2023.\n\nBut I think it's abundantly clear by now that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and that Bitcoin will probably be a reliable store of wealth for many years. MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor may be onto something after all. Truly committed Bitcoin bulls with diamond hands should see stellar results a few years down the road.\n\nThat being said, I still don't want to convert my entire net worth into Bitcoin and take out loans to buy more. Leave that to the professional risk-takers for now. Instead, I'm happy with a modest Bitcoin position that could serve me well in the long run without adding much short-term risk. It's a good place to park cash you won't need for at least a year or two, allowing Bitcoin to get over speed bumps and challenges on the road to sustained wealth. In fact, that's how I think about all investments. Saintly patience is arguably the best quality an investor could have. Just ask Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch."

        "content": "Bitcoin nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have captured the crypto world\u2019s attention fast, opening new opportunities for the oldest blockchain and digital art enthusiasts. Since their explosion in 2020, NFTs have been typically minted and traded on Ethereum-based platforms, besides other blockchains, such as Cardano and Solana.\n\nHowever, a new protocol known as Ordinals was launched in January 2023 by former Bitcoin Core contributor Casey Rodarmor, who exploited the 2021 Bitcoin Taproot upgrade to expand the cryptocurrency capability and enable on-chain Bitcoin-native NFTs.\n\nTaproot offered a way to expand the base layer\u2019s block capability by condensing the size of transactions requiring less data usage and encouraging the use of smart contracts on Bitcoin. The upgrade considerably increases the types of transactions possible on Bitcoin, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT applications.\n\nBy February 2023, the world\u2019s largest issuer of NFTs, Yuga Labs, had already announced the creation of TwelveFold, a new NFT collection issued on Bitcoin, thereby endorsing Bitcoin NFTs and avouching their success.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Bitcoin NFTs, how they differ from the most popular Ethereum-based alternative, and how to create and sell them.\n\nWhat are Ordinals?\n\nOrdinals are serial numbers imprinted in a single, unique satoshi (sat), the smallest unit of Bitcoin (BTC), through the ordinal theory that assigns them in the order in which they are mined. The first satoshi in the first block has the ordinal number 0, the second has the ordinal number 1, and the last satoshi of the first block has the ordinal number 4,999,999,999.\n\nColored coins were the first representation of such a concept back in 2012, being crypto assets repurposed to represent something of value by adding metadata information. Counterparty is another attempt to embed data into regular Bitcoin transactions. However, it has its own XCP token, required for some functionality, making it officially like an altcoin and not an extension or second layer for Bitcoin.\n\nThe ordinal theory rewards satoshis with numismatic value, allowing them to be collected and traded as rarities. Satoshis are given individual identities to be tracked, transferred and ingrained with meaningful arbitrary data, such as pictures, text or videos, through a Bitcoin transaction that remains permanently part of the blockchain. Such data can be viewed in Ordinals-compatible wallets, such as the Sparrow wallet, and online explorers.\n\nInscriptions\n\nThe process of assigning assets to individual satoshis is called inscription. Inscriptions are digital artifacts native to the Bitcoin blockchain, the digital equivalent of physical artifacts.\n\nThey are fully on-chain, do not require a sidechain or a separate token, and use the Ordinals protocol to inscribe sats with content on ord, an index, an explorer and a wallet that relies on Bitcoin Core for private key management and transaction signing.\n\nOrd allows tracking the location of specific satoshis and their ordinal numbers and can be viewed with the Ordinals explorer. In contrast with traditional NFTs that rely on off-chain content stored on the interplanetary file system (IPFS), inscriptions are gifted with Bitcoin\u2019s immutability and security. They are permissionless and uncensorable digital artifacts since they can be sold without a royalty.\n\nHow to create Bitcoin NFTs\n\nThe Ordinals ecosystem is in full development, but its accessibility is still restricted to two primary ways to mint an ordinal NFT.\n\nThe first method to inscribe Bitcoin Ordinals requires some technical skills, running a full Bitcoin node and then installing Ord on this node to inscribe satoshis into an Ordinals wallet and make Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs. Two types of Bitcoin wallets can process Ordinals; they both must be Taproot-compatible and have a \u201ccoin control\u201d capability to avoid spending Ordinal satoshis as network fees or sending them accidentally in another transaction.\n\nThe Sparrow wallet is only recommended for receiving Ordinals to avoid sending Ordinals sats inadvertently. However, using it does not require running a full node. Here\u2019s how to set up a Sparrow wallet.\n\nAn Ord wallet requires running a full node on 500GB capacity. Unlike the Sparrow wallet, an Ord wallet allows you to create inscriptions and freeze the inscribed sats to prevent accidental spending. Here\u2019s how to set up an Ord wallet.\n\nRegardless of the wallet you\u2019re using, make sure to have some Bitcoin available to pay for the transaction fee.\n\nThe second method is more straightforward and involves using a no-code tool, such as Gamma or Ordinalsbot.com, to inscribe your ordinal NFT. Here\u2019s how to mint your Ordinal on Gamma:\n\nSelect the type of file you\u2019d like to use to mint your Bitcoin NFT.\n\nUpload the necessary file from your computer.\n\nSet up the transaction fee depending on how long you\u2019d like to wait for your Ordinal to be minted.\n\nCopy and paste the Bitcoin address where to send the digital artifact, which needs to be an Ordinal-compatible address or a Taproot address.\n\nWait for the NFT to be minted. Such a wait depends on the fee you paid for the process to be completed and may be hours or even days. You\u2019ll be able to track the minting status through a link you\u2019ll receive by email.\n\nView your minted Ordinal on OrdinalsViewer.\n\nHow to trade Ordinals\n\nWhile proper infrastructure and marketplaces to trade Bitcoin Ordinals are being built, the digital artifacts are traded peer-to-peer over-the-counter (OTC) in dedicated Discord servers, with escrows as intermediaries and tracked on Google sheets.\n\nCompared to the more popular NFTs traded via Ethereum and other blockchains, Bitcoin Ordinals trading appears to be an obsolete method. Yet this hasn\u2019t contained people\u2019s interest in Bitcoin NFTs, with hundreds of thousands of newly minted digital artifacts emerging within only a few weeks from launch.\n\nThe Ordinals market is entirely trustless, using the secure, partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBT) technology, which allows users to easily sign transactions in cold storage, and atomic swaps with no intermediary and a market fee of 2.7%. A system to verify creators is being developed to include creator royalties of 4.2%.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin NFTs\n\nTaproot-compatible wallets must be used to buy Bitcoin Ordinals, such as the Ordinals wallet, the Xverse and Hiro wallets. The Ordinals wallet is very straightforward to use, and the others are also similar:\n\nCreate an account, secure your seed phrase, and deposit funds into the wallet.\n\nSelect the Ordinals you wish to purchase and click \u201cBuy Now.\u201d\n\nOnce the transaction has been executed, the Ordinals will be added to your wallet.\n\nHow to sell Bitcoin NFTs\n\nSimilar to buying a Bitcoin NFT, you\u2019ll need to pick a Bitcoin Taproot-compatible wallet and download it.\n\nCreate an account, secure your seed phrase, and upload your inscription. The fee will depend on the file size and how fast you\u2019d like the transaction completed.\n\nOnce your file has been inscribed onto the blockchain, you can view it on the Ordinals.com inscriptions page.\n\nYou can freeze the Ordinals to make sure you do not spend them.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to use a peer-to-peer OTC market, usually, the Bitcoin Ordinals Discord server, to sell your inscription.\n\nIt is recommended that particular attention is placed on these trades. Being in an unregulated peer-to-peer OTC market, platforms are full of scammers trying to catch the latest Bitcoin NFT craze.\n\nOrdinals vs. traditional NFTs\n\nA few differences distance Ethereum-based traditional NFTs from Bitcoin Ordinals, although they both tend to be grouped under the same umbrella of digital art. The creator of Bitcoin Ordinals, Casey Rodarmor, defines Bitcoin NFTs as authentic digital artifacts because they are on-chain and enjoy all of the good properties Bitcoin holds. Here are the main differences:\n\nBitcoin inscriptions are always immutable, while Ethereum-based NFTs can technically be changed or deleted by the contract owner. Traditional NFTs must be audited to become immutable, which requires deep knowledge of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solidity.\n\nBitcoin inscriptions always have on-chain content, making it impossible to be lost. It is durable and scarcer because inscription creators must pay fees proportional to the size of the content. In contrast, Ethereum NFT content can be off-chain and stored on platforms such as IPFS and could be lost.\n\nBitcoin inscriptions are more secure because the blockchain is the most secure. Inscriptions can be sold with PSBT without needing a third party, such as an exchange or marketplace, to transfer them on the user\u2019s behalf. On the other hand, Ethereum NFTs tend to grant intermediary platforms unlimited permission over a user\u2019s NFT, and the use of complex smart contracts may be challenging to interact with for the regular non-techie who wants to trade digital art.\n\nUnlike NFTs, which are minted as completely new tokens, Ordinals have the raw file data inscribed directly onto the sats on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBitcoin NFTs controversy\n\nThe new Ordinals protocol has raised an important question and sparked a heated debate among the NFT community. Should Bitcoin just be money, or should it expand its functionality to other use cases? Is the Ordinals protocol an attack on the Bitcoin network?\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain has traditionally been used only for payment transactions due to its limited block size and network architecture. Such infrastructure favors solutions built on top of the blockchain as additional layers to increase the network\u2019s programmability and scalability.\n\nThe latest Ordinals craze has raised many eyebrows among the BTC community. Some are concerned it could distract from Bitcoin\u2019s primary use case as a medium of exchange and whether Ordinals make good use of block space. Ordinals can be images, audio clips or even games inevitably requiring space that is subtracted from the financial data, significantly slowing down on-chain confirmation times.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s fungibility\n\nBitcoin\u2019s fungibility \u2014 one of the main properties of money \u2014 is also challenged by Ordinals. This is because inscriptions are imprinted in one satoshi, making it a rare unit, just like numismatic coins are rare physical objects used for collections.\n\nOrdinal satoshis become individual identities that can be tracked, transferred and imbued with meaningful information, such as text or an image, making the sat unique and turning it into a de facto NFT. On the other hand, the traditional stance views all satoshis as equal, or they begin to lose a significant trait of money.\n\nFull node costs\n\nA few weeks after the project was launched, a record-breaking-sized block of 4MB was created, raising concerns among the community about the future efficiency and costs of the blockchain and its full nodes. The average size of a Bitcoin block had never exceeded 1.5MB until the launch of Ordinal NFTs.\n\nInscription contrarians fear that increasing the Bitcoin blockchain size due to the big transactions and blocks would raise the requirements and costs for devices running a full node. The counterargument is that for the Bitcoin blockchain to be securer, its blocks must be full, which would justify users paying a higher fee.\n\nThe debate will unfold in the future as the Ordinals market takes a more robust shape and new opportunities arise. Ultimately, Bitcoin\u2019s true spirit and value reside in its resilience to guide the market in the direction the people want."

        "content": "Digital artifacts have come to Bitcoin, essentially breaking Ethereum and Solana\u2019s virtual duopoly on NFTs. But many have expressed their disdain for the technology based on inventor Casey Rodarmor\u2019s Ordinal protocol. And with good reason.\n\nOrdinals\u2019 inscription feature enables storage and tracking of NFT content on the BTC blockchain, but as industry observer \u201cBitcoin is Saving\u201d notes, \u201cjust because you can, doesn\u2019t mean you should.\u201d\n\nIndeed. Ethereum, with its proof-of-stake model, is much better positioned and equipped to accommodate the NFT industry and support responsible artists as they explore the next frontier of the new cultural economy.\n\nEthereum\u2019s code change to Proof of Stake enabled its validation process to use 99.95% less energy than a Proof of Work (PoW) protocol, like that used for Bitcoin transactions. By reducing the electricity needed to validate a transaction, Ethereum severed the lifeline PoW blockchain platforms provide to climate-destroying fossil fuel power plants used by Bitcoin miners. NFT artists now have a clear technology option that doesn\u2019t contribute to climate pollution.\n\nThe virtual reality artist known as Sutu, for example, leverages the resources that enable creativity to flourish around evolving technology while embracing global equity and environmental stewardship.\n\nIn championing the conscious crypto creator movement, Sutu highlights the social and financial viability of sustainable and transparent NFT practices. His limited-edition Neonz collection of 10,000 retro-futuristic avatars on Tezos sold for around a million dollars while publicizing clean NFT practices and demonstrating innovative avenues the arts community can follow to harness technology in the pursuit of sustainability.\n\nOrdinals give serial numbers to satoshis, Bitcoin\u2019s micro fractional currency, making them unique and non-fungible. Creators can then inscribe a satoshi with digital content \u2014 a picture, scanned document, video clip, etc. Moreover, by taking advantage of the cryptocurrency\u2019s Taproot and Segregated Witness features, these inscriptions can be as large as 4 megabytes, certainly large enough to accommodate these media. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nThe Rolling Stone Culture Council is an invitation-only community for Influencers, Innovators and Creatives. Do I qualify?\n\nThat\u2019s where much of the problem arises.\n\nBitcoin originally was intended to facilitate financial transactions only, and it has done an effective job of carrying out this task. But flooding the BTC blockchain with bulky, cumbersome NFTs causes several critical problems:\n\n1. It threatens to lock \u201csmall blockers\u201d who rely on the chain\u2019s limited scale to eke out revenues and small profits.\n\nThese players often are part of cottage industries in disadvantaged communities who cannot hope to compete with syndicates and Bitcoin pools to mine the larger blocks. As Bitcoin is Saving observed, \u201cmarginalized peoples in developing countries will have to pay more to run their Bitcoin nodes and send transactions.\u201d For example, a few days after the launch of Ordinal inscriptions, Luxor mined a block weighing in at 3.96 MB. While many blocks can grow to that size given thousands of financial transactions, this one contained only 63 because one is a 3.94 MB digital image.\n\n2. It obliterates Bitcoin\u2019s original intent.\n\nIf often-frivolous NFT projects grow legs on the Bitcoin blockchain, they may clog the entire process of precious bandwidth. Think of NFT inscriptions as farm tractors on the freeway. They take up multiple lanes and move slowly. Smaller financial transactions, which the chain was built and intended to serve, get stuck in the queue and cannot get around the lumbering traffic in front of it. They must bide their time until the tractor reaches its destination and pulls off the road. As the Luxor example shows, a single block could accommodate more than 10,000 financial transactions or one NFT.\n\nRelated\n\n3. It can cause costs to rise.\n\nBecause Ordinal inscriptions are performed, conducted and stored on Bitcoin\u2019s main network, the added congestion will put pressure on the supply of miners\u2019 ability to record data efficiently. Keeping these assets on-chain is a low-return use of resources that will drive up fees and transaction costs. And because NFT inscriptions will draw bigger payoffs, miners will likely favor them over the recording or financial dealings. Merchants, investors and other stakeholders will either have to match the higher NFT fees or be left behind.\n\n4. It opens the door to spam, bloatware, malicious data and socially unredeeming \u201cartifacts.\u201d\n\nRodarmor already has been forced to acknowledge this drawback and scramble to remove an extreme pornographic inscription from the front page of Ordinal\u2019s website. The offending satoshi, which was on the site for about 30 minutes, has been taken down but the image can never be expunged. Trending Andrew Tate Was Arrested After Adin Ross Blabbed About His Escape Plans Kristen Stewart Uncensored: 'I Want to Do the Gayest Thing You've Ever Seen in Your Life' SXSW, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott Spar About Bands Pulling Out in Protest of Military Sponsorship Will Congress Ban TikTok? Here's What's Going On\n\nOpening Bitcoin to NFTs compounds the blockchain\u2019s already difficult path to scaling and facilitating adoption. Legitimate financial transactions will feel the pinch as large NFT nodes soak up the available space and squeeze small miners and nodes out of the most profitable workflows.\n\nThe inscription practice also brings into question Bitcoin\u2019s fungibility and anonymity. If a few satoshis contain NFTs that fluctuate in value, they are different from their peers. Making some of the several satoshis unique could allow them to be easily traced, removing privacy protection, which is one of the blockchain\u2019s most valuable assets."

And I would sell my bitcoin right into this rally.\n\nCramer\u2019s previous support for Silicon Valley Bank\n\nCramer recently supported was Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), telling viewers of his show \u2018Mad Money\u2019 last month to buy stock in the now defunct bank.\n\nHowever, Cramer has been known to make an inverse call \u2014 even spawning several memes and even indexes based on picking the opposite of what Cramer recommends.\n\nQuantbase\u2019s Inverse Cramer Index is up 105.31% vs. benchmark since it\u2019s launch March 31, 2017.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s inverse Cramer surge\n\nFollowing the announcement by U.S. authorities that deposits in failed banks would be protected, BTC price surged to nearly $25,000 \u2014 representing a 20% increase since Friday\u2019s lows. The price rise caused a rally among major cryptocurrencies and crypto-related companies.\n\nHowever, the collapse of these banks is anticipated to result in a significant slowdown in Fed rate hikes, and it is now considered unlikely that there will be any further rate hikes."

On March 14, the BTC/USD pair surged to a 2023 peak at $26,550 after the news.\n\nBut, while the macroeconomic conditions may currently favor risk-on buyers, certain on-chain and market indicators hint at a potential correction in the near term.\n\nBTC flows back to exchanges as price rises\n\nOn March 13, Glassnode\u2019s exchange flow data recorded the most significant inflow to exchanges since May 2022. This means more supply on exchanges and potentially higher selling pressure.\n\nThe coin days destroyed indicator, which measures the time-weighted transfers of Bitcoin, also shows a small spike, indicating that old hands are moving coins. The indicators might signal profit booking by long-term holders, which can lead to a correction.\n\nBitcoin exchange netflow volume. Source: Glassnode\n\nBitcoin funding rates, RSI jump\n\nMoreover, the funding rate for Bitcoin perpetual swaps is also elevated with the latest Consumer Price Index print. In other words, more traders are betting on the upside with leveraged positions, increasing the risk of a correction.\n\nFunding rate for Bitcoin perpetual contracts. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe sharp price movement has also recorded a significant spike in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a technical momentum indicator, with a reading of as high as 82. This means that BTC/USD is generally considered \u201coverbought\u201d in the short term.\n\nBTC vs. USD painting a bearish pattern\n\nBTC price is currently forming a broadening wedge pattern, which depicts the heightened level of volatility. Both buyers and sellers are pushing the price beyond support and resistance levels, with the reversals coming quickly.\n\nBTC/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBuyers failed to stage a pattern breakout on March 14, and are now facing resistance at its ceiling of $26,700. At the same time, there is a chance that the price will correct back toward the bottom of the pattern, around $19,500, in the coming days.\n\nOn the contrary, if Bitcoin\u2019s price breaks above the top trendline, the bulls will likely pile in to push the price toward $30,000. There are potentially welcome signs for the bulls that this could happen \u2014 namely in the BTC options and futures markets.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, there\u2019s still room to run, as the indicators have yet to reach previous peak levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) increased by 28% between March 12 and 14, reaching $26,500, its highest level since June 2022. Some may attribute the gains to the Consumer Price Index\u2019s (CPI) 6% year-over-year increase in February, even though the figure was in line with expectations.\n\nThe inflation metric reached its lowest level since September 2021, which is a positive development, but it does not validate the United States Federal Reserve\u2019s attempt to reduce the metric to 2%. Most likely, risk markets, such as stocks and cryptocurrencies, soared after regional bank stocks recovered from their March 13 lows.\n\nAt 10:30 am Eastern Time, First Republic Bank (FRC) shares were trading 54% higher, followed by Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL) gaining 46% and KeyCorp (KEY) gaining 15%. The 30-year average mortgage rate decreased to 6.6% from 7.1% on March 7. Consequently, reduced mortgage rates have the potential to improve the housing market, which partially explains the rally.\n\nThe unexpected decline in mortgage rates may present an opportunity for price-sensitive homebuyers and homeowners waiting for a chance to lock in a lower rate. According to data from Realtor.com, a buyer of a median-priced home still faced a monthly mortgage payment that was 49% higher than it was one year prior.\n\nDespite the possibility of a recession in the U.S. due to high interest rates, China\u2019s economic outlook remains positive. Li Qiang addressed reporters on March 14 for the first time since assuming the position that oversees the State Council, China\u2019s highest executive body. According to Qiang, non-state-owned enterprises in China will have greater room for development.\n\nLet\u2019s look at derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nBitcoin margin markets signaling a market deficiency\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because it allows investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nFor example, one can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins and buying Bitcoin. On the other hand, borrowers of Bitcoin can only take short bets against the cryptocurrency.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nSince March 13, OKX traders\u2019 margin lending ratio has been above 35, indicating a significant mismatch in favor of Bitcoin longs. Readings above 40 are uncommon and driven by a high stablecoin borrowing cost of 25% per year.\n\nOne should refer to the BTC option markets to confirm whether professional traders are effectively expecting further price increases.\n\nOptions traders are far from excited\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become less risk-averse. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign whenever arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nThe indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the premium for protective put options is higher than the premium for risk call options.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 8%, and generalized excitement has a negative 8% skew.\n\nRelated: SVB and Silvergate are out, but major banks are still backing crypto firms\n\nBitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nOn March 13, when Bitcoin broke above the $22,000 resistance level, the BTC options\u2019 main risk gauge exited the fear zone that had been in place for three days. As options traders assigned the same risk assessment to bullish and bearish strategies, the 25% delta skew entered a neutral zone.\n\nHowever, it would be incorrect to conclude that the negative 5% skew seen briefly on March 14 indicates excessive optimism or bullishness. Analysts and pundits frequently jump the gun and celebrate quick reversions, but anything between -8% and +8% remains in the neutral zone.\n\nAccording to the pricing of options contracts, derivatives data indicates that professional traders maintained their long positions using margin markets and exited their bearish stance on March 13. Given the improvement in macroeconomic market conditions, Bitcoin bulls are well-positioned to drive the price above $26,000.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "content": "The ongoing crisis of banks in the United States has many positive implications for Bitcoin (BTC), according to an executive at the hardware wallet firm Trezor.\n\nOn March 14, Bitcoin broke $26,000, a price level not seen since June 2022, posting the biggest gains this year so far. The multi-month high followed a series of shocking events in the U.S. banking industry, with banks such as Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Silvergate and Signature shutting down operations.\n\nAccording to Trezor Bitcoin analyst Josef T\u011btek, the current sharp rise of Bitcoin\u2019s price \u2014 which is the fastest rise in price so far in 2023 \u2014 appears to be a direct result of the \u201capparent fragility of the banking system.\u201d\n\nT\u011btek said that the current banking crisis could potentially make Bitcoin emerge as a safe haven and risk-off asset. He emphasized that Bitcoin was created soon after the world encountered the financial crisis of 2008 and was \u201clikely a response to the unfairness of bailouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe current events are a timely reminder of why we need Bitcoin,\u201d T\u011btek said, adding that the current events are not so good for many crypto businesses and assets that are centralized, referring to Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC). The analyst stated:\n\n\u201cThe current demise of certain banks is definitely good for Bitcoin as such, but not a good environment for custodians of any kind, and once again we reiterate that one the safest environments is to self-custody assets.\u201d\n\nAccording to T\u011btek, the recent events with Silvergate and SVB clearly show that counterparty risk in the banking system is a \u201cserious problem,\u201d though it is sometimes well hidden. He added:\n\n\u201cBanks no longer actually hold our money, but lend it out and buy volatile assets with it. Depositors are, in fact, the banks\u2019 creditors. Understandably, people are looking for alternatives such as Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nT\u011btek also suggested that Silvergate\u2019s collapse was a \u201cdirect result of its business relationship\u201d with the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, while SVB\u2019s collapse was a result of \u201cpoor risk management.\u201d He went on to say that SVB had a large exposure to long-term treasuries, which tanked in price as a result of the abrupt interest rate hikes, while the bank failed to have hedges in place. \u201cSVB had little connection to the crypto industry,\u201d T\u011btek added.\n\nRelated: SVB crisis: Here are the crypto firms denying exposure to troubled US banks\n\nT\u011btek\u2019s remarks come amid Signature Bank board member and former U.S. Congressperson Barney Frank arguing that the latest U.S. banking events are connected to crypto.\n\n\u201cI think part of what happened was that regulators wanted to send a very strong anti-crypto message,\u201d Frank stated, claiming that issues at Signature were \u201cpurely contagion from SVB.\u201d"

        "title": "How to Buy Bitcoin on Coinbase - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "Affiliate disclaimer: Please note that some links on Bitcoin Market Journal are affiliate links. If you click and make a purchase or open an account we may receive a commission. This is at no cost to you, but helps to support the growth of BMJ.\n\nThere are multiple ways to buy bitcoin, but perhaps the easiest and safest way is through an exchange like Coinbase. This article will show you how to buy bitcoin on this popular exchange. When you\u2019re ready you can get started right here.\n\nLaunched in 2012, Coinbase is a popular site for crypto investors, primarily because it is easy to use. Coinbase reports over 110 million verified users \u2013 that\u2019s more than Charles Schwab, with 33.6 million active brokerage accounts.\n\nGetting Started\n\nHere is what you need before you get started:\n\nA valid email address\n\nA valid photo ID (such as a driver\u2019s license)\n\nA bank account or credit card\n\nCoinbase has no minimum account size. That means you can buy bitcoin at Coinbase and then ship it to your private wallet, leaving a zero account balance at Coinbase if you like. Perhaps the safest way to hold bitcoin is in your own private wallet, in case the exchange gets hacked.\n\nYou will need valid identification, such as a driver\u2019s license or photo ID. You will upload your ID directly on the Coinbase website. For security purposes, Coinbase does not allow you to send your ID by email.\n\nYou also need a bank account or credit card to make purchases. During due diligence, Coinbase will send a few pennies to your bank account; then you must verify the amount to Coinbase. All this is for verification and authentication purposes. Like any bank or money transmitter, Coinbase must comply with Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering laws.\n\nOpen Your Coinbase Account\n\nOnce you are ready to sign up for an account, go to the account signup page, where you will see this:\n\nSimply fill in the required fields to open your account. You will be prompted to upload your ID and verify your bank account or credit card as you go. Simply follow the prompts as they appear to complete account set up.\n\nOnce you have opened an account at Coinbase, you will see a dashboard with the price of bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and other coins listed, along with your current balance of each coin and the market\u2019s top movers.\n\nBuying Bitcoin\n\nTo buy bitcoin, scroll up to the top of the main Coinbase page and click on Buy/Sell. A screen will pop up that looks like this:\n\nYou can specify a dollar amount of bitcoin you want and by clicking the \u201cPreview Buy\u201d button you can see the amount of BTC you would receive for that amount. In this case, the purchase is for $100 worth of bitcoin or 0.00428171 BTC.\n\nYou will see the order to buy 0.01411305 BTC for $100, with a $2.99 Coinbase fee, which is 2.99 percent of the purchase price. The price of bitcoin was $22,656.84 at the time of the sale.\n\nHit \u201cBuy now\u201d Then you will see the confirmation of your purchase. Note that the amount of bitcoin purchased could be slightly different than on the preview screen as Coinbase is constantly updating the purchase based on the market price. In this case the preview showed 0.01411305 BTC for $100, however we ended up getting 0.01428165 BTC for $100 because the price of bitcoin dropped slightly in the 30 seconds or so it took to complete the transaction. This worked in our favor this time, but that might not always be the case.\n\nYou can always see the purchase by clicking on Bitcoin from your Home screen and then switching to the \u201cPrimary balance\u201d tab. It will show all the purchases made from your Coinbase account, how much BTC you received, and how much fiat you paid. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t show the fees paid, which would be a nice addition.\n\nSetting Up Recurring Buys\n\nOne approach to buying an investment with a fluctuating price like bitcoin is dollar cost averaging. Dollar cost averaging is buying a fixed amount every month to average in your cost basis. Dollar cost averaging works well for investors who are buying stocks or cryptocurrencies on a fixed monthly budget.\n\nCoinbase allows you to set up this kind of recurring transaction straight from your dashboard if you wish. Simply click the dropdown in the middle of the Buy/Sell page (it defaults to \u201cone time purchase\u201d but there are several options to choose from) and choose the frequency of your recurring purchase.\n\nConclusion\n\nCoinbase is a good way to get started with buying bitcoin and altcoins because of its ease of use. It also offers sales of Ethereum, Litecoin, and Cardano, as well as Polygon, Solana, and Polkadot. Overall, there are currently 172 assets available for trading, and 212 assets you could hold in the Coinbase wallet.\n\nYet Coinbase has limitations. Its fees are quite a bit higher than other exchanges. Also, Coinbase does not offer Ripple XRP or several other popular currencies like Tron and Dash. A review of other crypto trading sites can be found here.\n\nThe market is huge, with about 9,000 altcoins currently.

        "content": "Bitcoin Country seeks to generate world-class Bitcoin and Lightning engineers through a new program utilizing the university system.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Office has announced a new six month educational program entitled \u201cCUBO+\u201d that aims to produce elite-level Bitcoin and Lighting developers through the Salvadoran university system.\n\nAccording to the Office, the program, beginning in May, will consist of a relatively small group of students, under 25, narrowed down from some of the brightest students in El Salvador\u2019s universities. The first group will be through students at the University of Don Bosco. They will be competing for the inaugural Plan B Fellowship, funded by Tether and Fulgur Ventures. The project is a result of the recently announced agreement between El Salvador and Lugano, Switzerland for the world\u2019s first Bitcoin Embassy in the Swiss city.\n\nThe program will be led and taught by some of the brightest minds in Bitcoin who will be announced soon. Classes will range in topics from high-level technical development specific to Bitcoin, to distributed technologies such as Holepunch, Nostr and Web5. Private funding is responsible for the program, and all students who qualify for the Plan B Fellowship will receive a stipend in order for them to cover the costs of the course.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first two months of the program will be online, followed by a two week in-person bootcamp, featuring intense full-day courses located in San Salvador. The remaining months will include close online mentorship with the top names in Bitcoin.\n\nThe information shared with Bitcoin Magazine described how the program will become a framework upon which others can utilize as an open-source standard for high-level Bitcoin education. Educational experts are participating in the course design which promises to set the standard for other nations to follow.\n\nStudents who complete the course will be presented with various options for continuing their Bitcoin journey, including the option to take on a full-time job at reputable Bitcoin companies. Otherwise, entrepreneurial opportunities and continuing education will be available.\n\nThe name Cubo+ is derived from a project that President Nayib Bukele started in his Mayor position of San Salvador. When he was mayor, the city would erect buildings in areas that were impoverished, and these buildings served as libraries and community centers for furthering education. The program hopes to draw on this inspiration for building El Salvador\u2019s future.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) saw a sharp uptick over $26,000 as the United States Department of Labor released the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for February 2023.\n\nCPI rose 0.4% last month on a seasonally adjusted basis, with the department noting that the all-items index denoting inflation increased by 6% over the last year. The Labor Department notes that inflation saw its lowest 12-month increase since the period ending September 2021.\n\nCNBC reported that conventional markets were volatile following the release, while cryptocurrency markets reacted positively. Bitcoin saw a surge in price alongside Ether (ETH), according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nCPI measures the average change over time in consumer prices for a basket of goods and services. It\u2019s calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and is used as an indicator of inflation.\n\nCPI reflects the spending patterns of consumers on items such as food, housing, transportation, clothing, medical care and recreation. It\u2019s used to adjust wages, benefits and social security payments for inflation, measure economic performance and set monetary policy.\n\nThe U.S. Labor Department\u2019s statement notes that the shelter index was the largest contributor to the monthly all-items increase, accounting for 70% of February 2023\u2019s CPI increase. Indexes for food, recreation, household furnishings and operations also contributed.\n\nThe food index increased 0.4% last month, while the food at home index rose 0.3%. The energy index decreased by 0.6%, while natural gas and fuel oil indexes also declined in February.\n\nThe broader cryptocurrency community offered a variety of takes on March 14. Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner of Morgan Creek Digital, weighed in on the CPI update in a series of tweets, highlighting Bitcoin\u2019s price appreciation in response to the latest inflation numbers:\n\nBitcoin continues to accelerate in response to high inflation, a legacy banking crisis, and lack of predictability in the Fed's response. \u2014 Pomp (@APompliano) March 14, 2023\n\nBitcoin proponent and Custodia Bank founder and CEO Caitlin Long, highlighted BTC\u2019s price performance in the wake of a tumultuous week that saw the likes of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closed by U.S. regulators:"

        "content": "Episode 7 of Cointelegraph\u2019s Crypto Trading Secrets podcast is now live. This week\u2019s episode features an interview with crypto trader Zoran Kole, who goes by @Captain_Kole1 on Twitter. Kole shared his opinions in response to a number of questions asked by host Benjamin Pirus during the episode\u2019s recording on March 1 \u2014 including his views on what he thinks has most impacted the price of Bitcoin (BTC) so far in 2023 (as of the show\u2019s recording), and whether or not that may remain the case for the remainder of the year.\n\nBitcoin started off 2023 trading between $16,000 and $17,000, according to Cointelegraph\u2019s BTC price index. The asset found itself up near $24,000 toward the end of January and surpassed $25,000 in February. The coin subsequently dropped back down below $20,000 in March, but has since moved up past $26,000.\n\n\u201cThere have been murmurs that Binance is buying up a lot of the Bitcoin using their BUSD,\u201d Kole said. Binance USD (BUSD) is a stablecoin under the Binance brand but issued by Paxos Trust Company, and it faced regulatory uncertainty in February. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has asserted that Paxos wholly owns and oversees BUSD. Kole, however, thinks 2023\u2019s price action so far may be the result of prolonged price suppression and people\u2019s desire to gain back their 2022 losses:\n\n\u201cTo phrase it more simply, in 2023, I think the allure of making it back in one trade is kind of the reason that prices have propelled up since the beginning of the year.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kole doesn\u2019t exactly think that rationale will remain in play for the whole year. He explained:\n\n\u201cI do expect a lot of range-bound behavior to occur. So, all the buyers that were able to buy $15,000, $16,000, $17,000 are probably going to look to distribute somewhere in the upper $20,000s, lower $30,000s. So, I do think we\u2019re going to see quite a bit of chop going into the end of the year.\u201d\n\nKole also answered several other questions during the episode, including giving his thoughts on potential future cycles for BTC.\n\nCheck out this and other episodes from Cointelegraph\u2019s Crypto Trading Secrets podcast on Cointelegraph\u2019s podcast page, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts or TuneIn.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "title": "Bitcoin hash rate continues to rise, but DeFi is under threat: Report - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The beginning of 2023 raised hopes that the blockchain industry was on the path toward recovery, but weaker-than-hoped financial performance and a bout of negative news in February have cast doubts on this outlook. However, these headwinds do not affect all sectors of the industry uniformly. Nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and security tokens have managed to decouple from the broader environment and showed positive signs in February, but the rest of the market remains cautious.\n\nFor those serious about understanding the crypto space\u2019s various sectors, Cointelegraph Research publishes a monthly Investors Insights report that dives into venture capital, derivatives, decentralized finance (DeFi), regulation and much more. Compiled by leading experts on these various topics, the monthly reports are an invaluable tool to quickly get a sense of the current state of the blockchain industry.\n\nDownload and purchase this month\u2019s report on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.\n\nCan the mining industry consolidate its finances?\n\nThe bear market has witnessed multiple news stories about struggling miners, particularly publicly traded United States mining operations with high levels of debt that correspondingly suffered from lower Bitcoin (BTC) prices. However, the release of new, highly efficient mining hardware in 2022 \u2014 such as Bitmain\u2019s Antminer S19 Pro and S19 XP and Microbt\u2019s WhatsMiner M53 \u2014 has resulted in efficiency gains of up to 30%, according to data from Hashrate Index. Cointelegraph Research\u2019s August 2022 trends report pointed investors to the release of this new hardware and projected that the Bitcoin network\u2019s hash rate would rise as a result.\n\nSince August, the hash rate has indeed kept hitting new all-time highs despite the bearish market conditions, which traditionally cause a drop. Iris Energy has purchased 44,000 Antminer S19j Pro miners, with CleanSpark adding 20,000 S19j Pro+ miners to its arsenal as well. This is despite Iris Energy defaulting on debt obligations back in November.\n\nStaying ahead of the rest of the network is critical in the mining sector. Those who manage to raise capital and procure new electricity-saving hardware earlier than others will be able to turn significant profits before the difficulty catches up again. For miners that manage to raise this capital, there may be hope.\n\nIntensifying regulatory pressure on the DeFi sector\n\nMeanwhile, regulators are stepping up their enforcement actions and threatening the backbone of the DeFi sector. On Feb. 12, it was revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had initiated a crackdown on Paxos, a major stablecoin issuer. The SEC sent Paxos a Wells notice, informing the company of the regulator\u2019s intention to file a lawsuit against it for offering unregistered securities \u2014 and specifically referring to Binance USD (BUSD) as the security in question. In the aftermath of the notice, BUSD lost over 40% of its market capitalization.\n\nAs stablecoins provide safe ways for traders to take profits, this crackdown is a major threat to the industry. Many fear that Paxos will not remain the only target and that these actions will become widespread. Labeling stablecoins as securities is a surprising move by the SEC, given that there are no obvious expectations of profit from them.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the SEC\u2019s action will be followed up with similar steps against Tether and its USDT (USDT) stablecoin, which is allegedly being used by North Korea and Venezuela to evade sanctions. Other key developments in this area can be found in the Regulation and DeFi sections of this month\u2019s Investor Insights Report from Cointelegraph Research.\n\nThe Cointelegraph Research team\n\nCointelegraph\u2019s Research department comprises some of the best talents in the blockchain industry. Bringing together academic rigor and filtered through practical, hard-won experience, the researchers on the team are committed to bringing the most accurate, insightful content available on the market.\n\nDemelza Hays, Ph.D., is the director of research at Cointelegraph. Hays has compiled a team of subject matter experts from finance, economics and technology to bring the premier source for industry reports and insightful analysis to the market. The team utilizes APIs from various sources to provide accurate, useful information and analyses.\n\nWith decades of combined experience in traditional finance, business, engineering, technology and research, the Cointelegraph Research team is perfectly positioned to put its combined talents to proper use with the latest Investor Insights Report.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are for general informational purposes only and are not intended to provide specific advice or recommendations for any individual or on any specific security or investment product."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nHow have nearly 3,000 Africans adopted Bitcoin\u2014often called \u201cthe internet of money\u201d\u2014without actually having access to the internet?\n\nThe answer lies with Machankura, a tool built by software developer Kgothatso Ngako for using Bitcoin with nothing but a feature phone. No computer, smartphone, or internet service is required.\n\n\u201cI had set up a raspberry pi running both a Bitcoin and Lightning node and was trying to figure out what I could build on top of it,\u201d Ngako told Decrypt via direct message. \u201cA USSD project was intriguing because quite a lot of African Bitcoiners were already talking about building a wallet for feature phone users.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe challenge was accepted on Twitter.\n\nUSSD stands for Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, a protocol used in telecommunications networks for sending short text messages. It's similar to Interactive Voice Response, with which a mobile network operator\u2019s customer service might tell you which numbers to press for accessing a particular service, but in text form.\n\nWith Machankura, mobile phone users across a range of African countries can access the app by dialing a specific code, depending on their location and the service they wish to access. Its services include sending or receiving Bitcoin, checking one\u2019s balance, or even bartering Bitcoin for goods and services on Bitrefill.\n\n\n\nThe tool can even interact with the Lightning Network, a layer-2 payments system that enables instantaneous and virtually free Bitcoin transactions.\n\nNgako chose a UX solution called The Lightning Address to enable phone users to easily identify lightning addresses for both sending and receiving satoshis. Standard lightning invoices look like long random strings of text that must be copied and pasted, a function that feature phone users don\u2019t have.\n\n\n\nThe developer said there are now 2,900 people using Machankura, spread across 8 countries in which it is active: Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia. Going by figures previously posted from the app\u2019s Twitter page, that\u2019s a 10X increase since August.\n\nAs Bitcoin adoption grows, tools like Machankura could expand to serve an estimated 2.9 billion people on Earth who still lack internet access.\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe the tool could help \u2018Bitcoin the un-Bitcoined,\u2019\u201d opined Ngako. \u201cPayment technology is very dependent on network effects. Both receiver and sender need the ability to send and receive for the payment technology to be adopted.\u201d\n\n"

        "content": "The previous six months should have been extremely beneficial to Ether\u2019s (ETH) price, especially following the project\u2019s most significant upgrade ever in September 2022. However, the reality was the opposite: Between Sept. 15, 2022 and March 15, 2023, Ether underperformed by 10% against Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nETH/BTC price ratio on Bitfinex, 2-day. Source: TradingView\n\nThe ETH/BTC price ratio of 0.068 had been holding since October 2022, a support that was broken on March 15. Whatever the reason for the underperformance, traders currently have little confidence in placing leverage bets, according to ETH futures and options data.\n\nBut first, one should consider why Ether\u2019s price was expected to rise in the previous six months. On Sept.15, 2022, the Merge \u2014 a hard fork that switched the network to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism \u2014 occurred. It enabled a much lower, even negative, coin issuing rate. But more importantly, the change paved the way for parallel processing that aimed to bring scalability and lower transaction costs to the Ethereum network.\n\nThe Shapella hard fork, expected to take effect on the mainnet in April, is the next step in the Ethereum network upgrade. The change will allow validators who previously deposited 32 ETH to enter the staking mechanism to withdraw in part or in full. While this development is generally positive because it gives validators more flexibility, the potential 1.76 million ETH unlock is a negative consequence.\n\nHowever, there is a cap on the number of validators that can exit; therefore, the maximum daily unstake is 70,000 ETH. Moreover, after exiting the validation process, one may choose between Lido, Rocket Pool or a decentralized finance (DeFi) application for yield mechanisms. These coins will not necessarily be sold on the market.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Ether derivatives data to understand if the recent drop below the 0.068 ETH/BTC ratio has affected investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nETH futures recovered from a state of panic\n\nIn healthy markets, the annualized three-month futures premium should trade between 5% and 10% to cover associated costs and risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount (\u201cbackwardation\u201d) relative to traditional spot markets, it indicates traders\u2019 lack of confidence and is regarded as a bearish indicator.\n\nEther 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nDerivatives traders became uncomfortable holding leverage long (bull) positions as the Ether futures premium moved below zero on March 11, down from 3.5% just two days prior. More importantly, the current 2.5% premium remains modest and distant from the 5% neutral-to-bullish threshold.\n\nNonetheless, declining demand for leverage longs (bulls) does not necessarily imply an expectation of negative price action. As a result, traders should examine Ether\u2019s options markets to understand how whales and market makers price the likelihood of future price movements.\n\nRelated: Lark Davis on fighting social media storms, and why he\u2019s an ETH bull \u2014 Hall of Flame\n\nETH options confirm a lack of risk appetite\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign showing when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection. In bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 8%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -8%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nEther 30-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nOn March 3, the delta skew crossed the bearish 8% threshold, indicating stress among professional traders. The fear levels peaked on March 10, when the price of Ether plummeted to $1,370, its lowest level in 56 days, although the price of ETH rebounded above $1,480 on March 12.\n\nSurprisingly, on March 12, the 25% delta skew metric continued to rise, reaching its highest level of skepticism since November 2022. It happened just hours before Ether\u2019s price rose 20% in 48 hours, which explains why ETH traders shorting futures contracts faced $507 million in liquidations.\n\nThe 3% delta skew metric currently signals a balanced demand for ETH call and put options. When combined with the neutral stance on the ETH futures premium, the derivatives market indicates that professional traders are hesitant to place either bullish or bearish bets. Unfortunately, ETH derivatives metrics do not favor traders expecting Ether to reclaim the 0.068 level against Bitcoin in the near term.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

Clearly [the SVB collapse] has shaken faith in traditional banks.\u201d\n\nNigel Green, CEO of financial consultancy firm deVere Group, said that long-term inflation of the US dollar and other fiat currencies could also see bitcoin\u2019s function as a stable store of value \u2013 it has a fixed supply of 21 million coins \u2013 continue to be realised over the coming years.\n\n\u201cInvestors are looking for alternative currencies, such as cryptocurrencies,\u201d he said. \u201cMoving forward, these will increasingly compete with traditional, fiat ones, and this will help trigger the decreasing dominance of currently leading international currencies.\u201d\n\nWhile those within the crypto industry blamed the banking problems on issues with centralised financial systems, others blamed the banks\u2019 involvement with digital assets.\n\n\u201cAs the impact of FTX\u2019s collapse continues to ripple outward, today we are seeing what can happen when a bank is over-reliant on a risky, volatile sector like cryptocurrencies,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, chair of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\n\u201cAs the bank of choice for crypto, Silvergate Bank\u2019s failure is disappointing but predictable.\u201d\n\n( )\n\nCrypto figures disuputed this assessment, claiming that the bank\u2019s collapse was a result of not having enough cash to back up depositors demands.\n\nMarcus Sotiriou, a market analyst at the publicly listed digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said Silvergate\u2019s demise \u201cwas not a crypto problem\u201d, claiming that there was bias among some politicians towards the traditional financial sector.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear agenda, in my opinion, against all crypto businesses from US politicians,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe could well see companies that provide digital asset trading infrastructure move offshore because of this stance.\u201d"

In fact, due to the aforementioned, there has been a new wave of sustained interest in the crypto-market, especially blue chip coins such as BTC and ETH.\n\nRead BTC\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nHolding on\n\nHowever, new addresses planning to buy BTC may have a tough time doing so as currently, long-term investors make up 73% of the overall supply. These long-term investors are less likely to sell their holdings and are more prone to HODL their BTC.\n\nThis would make it difficult for new investors to get their hands on BTC at discounted rates.\n\nTo investors realizing that they might want to own some Bitcoin now that the Fed is already intervening, good luck getting what's left.

You're not getting my coins, and there are many others like me. pic.twitter.com/0sAZxskXl9 \u2014 Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) March 13, 2023\n\nAs the popularity of Bitcoins continues to rise, so will its prices, which would make it harder for new addresses to buy BTC.\n\nThe hike in BTC\u2019s growing popularity cannot be attributed solely to the USDC incident, however, as recent developments related to BTC inscriptions have also contributed to the same.\n\nBTC inscriptions have now allowed for NFTs to be minted through the Bitcoin network. They now make up for 63% of all inscription activity. NFTs such as Bitcoin Punks, Rocks, and Taproot Wizards have been showing huge potential for Bitcoin\u2019s NFT market.\n\nAside from NFTs, other services such as naming systems have also generated interest in the Bitcoin network. The same was evidenced by the popularity of Sats Names, with the latter recording 46,000 new registrations over the last 2 weeks.\n\nDue to all these factors, it is unlikely that new addresses could get a hold of new BTC at lower rates anytime soon. However, there are other indicators that suggest that there may be an incentive for some BTC holders to sell their current holdings.\n\nThe lure of profits\u2026\n\nAccording to Santiment, the MVRV ratio for BTC has hit a new high over the last few days. This suggested that a vast majority of BTC holders could sell their coins for a profit.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nEven though long-term holders may not be as incentivized to sell their holdings, many of the short-term holders that are still active could end up exiting their positions.\n\nThis could drive BTC\u2019s prices down and give new investors an opportunity to buy BTC at an attractive rate."

        "content": "Another basic economic principle that whales can take advantage of says the price of an asset will increase if the demand exceeds supply. With this in mind, an individual or group of bitcoin whales can initiate buying pressure. If the coin supply does not meet this high demand, the price of BTC will surge. This buying spree may trigger the fear of missing out ( FOMO ) among other traders. As a result, traders will likely start to buy BTC in the hopes that the price will continue to rise. Once BTC surges to the desired price, the whale can start selling at a profit."

However, a few stablecoins lost their pegging to the US dollar amid the crisis but mainstream tokens, particularly, the US dollar were flexing muscles.\n\n\n\nBitcoin advanced another 10 per cent, hitting $24,000-mark. A flight from stablecoins pushed Bitcoin's store of value higher. Its largest peer Ethereum was trading 5 per cent higher and was hovering around $1,700-levels. Altcoins outperformed the blue chips tokens, rallying up to 40 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe closure of three crypto-friendly banks, Silvergate, SVB, and Signature, is likely to result in short-term liquidity issues since these banks acted as the primary ramps for dollars into crypto assets.

However, the gains were capped and some tokens saw some profit booking during the early trading hours in Asia.\n\nTraders expect that the worst is over for the digital token market after the global fallout triggered by the American banking sector. Coupled with this, the US inflation numbers were in-line with the expectation, hinting that aggressive rate hikes by the US Fed are likely to be scrapped.\n\nBitcoin briefly topped the $26,000 market before giving up some gains.

This is BTC\u2019s highest since June 2022. The fact that BTC has only one strong near-term resistance in its golden pocket at $25,959 should further give merit to its bullishness\n\nBut it has shed its gains and is trading below $25,000 again.

        "title": "The Bitcoin (BTC) Whale, Who Sold At $69K, Has Started Accumulating RenQ Finance (RENQ); The Reason Will ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market is full of surprises, and it\u2019s not uncommon for investors to make bold moves. Recently, news broke out that a Bitcoin (BTC) whale who sold at $69K has started to accumulate RenQ Finance (RENQ). This move has left many investors wondering what could have motivated the whale to make such a shift.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look at RenQ Finance (RENQ) and explore why the whale might have chosen to invest in this project. We\u2019ll also examine some of the unique features of RenQ Finance (RENQ) and explain why it could be a smart investment choice for 2023.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Whales Restrategize with a focus on New Coins\n\nBitcoin (BTC) whales, or large cryptocurrency holders, are now strategizing with a focus on new coins. RenQ Finance (RENQ) is one of these coins. These whales, known for their ability to manipulate the cryptocurrency market with their massive holdings, have been identified by tracking their activities through known whale addresses, order books, sudden changes in market capitalization, and trades on crypto exchanges.\n\nIn the past, Bitcoin (BTC) whales have caused volatility in the market by putting up massive sell orders for their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, keeping the price lower than other sell orders. However, now they seem to be shifting their focus towards new types of coins.\n\nOne reason for this shift in strategy could be the growing interest of traditional firms in cryptocurrency. Companies like MicroStrategy have acquired large amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) and issued company debt to buy more. As these traditional firms enter the market, Bitcoin (BTC) whales may see opportunities in newer, lesser-known coins that can potentially offer higher returns.\n\nThe focus on new coins by Bitcoin (BTC) whales indicates a changing landscape in the cryptocurrency market, where traditional firms are becoming more involved, and investments in lesser-known coins are becoming more attractive.\n\n>>>>> BUY RENQ TOKENS HERE <<<<<\n\nWhy whales are choosing to Invest heavily in RenQ Finance (RENQ)\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) is a multi-chain non-custodial decentralized exchange that elevates decentralized trading by offering users a direct trading option via the RenQ wallet app. RenQ Finance (RENQ) aims to connect all isolated blockchains and establish a cross-chain asset exchange network, all while providing the DeFi ecosystem with all necessary underlying support. This will provide every digital asset owner with a truly safe, free, and transparent DeFi service.\n\nWhales are choosing to invest heavily in RenQ Finance (RENQ) for a few reasons. The RenQ wallet app is one of the main benefits of RenQ Finance (RENQ). The RenQ wallet app provides users with all of the benefits of centralized exchanges in a decentralized setting. It combines all DEXs into a single dApp, giving users access to a diverse range of liquidity sources. Users can engage in various DeFi activities such as Swapping, Staking, Lending, and Borrowing, among others, as well as a whole new set of features available only through large centralized exchanges. The best part is that you can do all of this without having to create a new account on each trading platform you visit.\n\nAnother reason whales invest heavily in RenQ Finance (RENQ) is its governance mechanism allowing users to vote on proposals and decisions affecting the platform\u2019s development.

        "content": "Authorities have seized and taken down the website of ChipMixer\n\nThe crypto mixer was used to launder funds stolen from Binance, Ronin Bridge, and FTX\n\nBitcoin mixer \u2013 ChipMixer has been shut down by authorities, as per an announcement by Europol. The operation involved the collaboration of regulatory authorities from various countries. The operation also resulted in the seizure of four servers, over 1909.4 Bitcoins (BTC) \u2013 over $46.6 million (nearly EUR 44.2 million), and 7 TB of data.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nMultiple agencies collaborate to bring down the Bitcoin mixer\n\nUnited States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Homeland Security Investigation, and Department of Justice took part in taking down the platform. Germany\u2019s Federal Criminal Police Office and General Prosecutors Office Frankfurt-Main also headed the operations. Others included Belgium\u2019s Federal police, Poland\u2019s Central Cybercrime Bureau, and Switzerland\u2019s Cantonal Police of Zurich. The press release further said,\n\n\u201cThe ChipMixer software blocked the blockchain trail of the funds, making it attractive for cybercriminals looking to launder illegal proceeds from criminal activities such as drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, ransomware attacks, and payment card fraud.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Europol claims that the Bitcoin mixer, launched in mid-2017, was used to launder over $2.87 billion in cryptocurrencies. A majority of this activity was related to markets in the darkweb, stolen cryptocurrencies, and illegal goods trafficking.\n\nNotably, ransomware groups like Mamba, Dharma, Zeppelin, and others have the Bitcoin mixer to launder illegally obtained funds. In addition, the regulatory authorities are investigating the platform\u2019s possible association with the funds related to the now-bankrupt crypto exchange \u2013 FTX. The authorities are investigating whether the mixer was used by hackers to launder FTX\u2019s funds, which totally amounted to $372 million. As per an on-chain sleuth, ZachXBT, ChipMixer was used to launder 360 BTC of FTX\u2019s funds.\n\nThe Bitcoin mixer was also used by hackers to launder money stolen by Ronin Bridge, according to a report by Slowmist. Hackers had sent 26,021.89 BTC to Chipmixer. The same platform was used by Binance hackers in August 2019, with over 5,300 BTC sent for mixing.\n\nThe current action has resulted in the shut down of the website. However, the authority has not announced any arrests related to the case. The press release further read,"

        "content": "Share this article URL Copied\n\nWhen Max Mellenbruch began creating Kialara ten years ago, few people had heard much about bitcoin, let alone crypto art. The idea of a cold-storage wallet to preserve private keys over a long period of time, safeguarding them against physical deterioration, was quite innovative for its time.\n\nArt and security\n\nA decade later the concept, designed in a manner that cannot be opened without being destroyed, has gained the admiration of a loyal customer base keen to collect the different aesthetic and conceptual themes developed for each edition. Besides the protection of a meticulously hand-assembled housing of precision-machined SUS304 stainless steel, beauty itself plays the role of preserving the bitcoin balances untouched, turning Kialara into an intriguing piece of contemporary art.\n\nThe latest edition, Kialara Builders, a tribute to the technologies that led to the advent of Bitcoin, is crowned with a shiny chunk of .999 Monocrystalline silicon, perhaps the most important technological material of the last few decades. The protagonist is a little robot made up of mining parts representing the incessant \u201crace towards the block\u201d undertaken by each miner that makes up the Bitcoin network worldwide.\n\nA forthcoming edition will mark a transition towards a trustless wallet model enabled by self-custodial design. With this release, Kialara is responding to a growing Bitcoin trend, as BTC supply held outside centralized exchanges continues to increase. The \u2018Builders\u2019 edition is available for purchase on the Kialara website now where individuals can also sign up for Kialara\u2019s mailing list and be notified when the new edition is released.\n\nAbout Kialara\n\nCollectors appreciate Kialara\u2019s brilliant integration of innovative cold-storage engineering with world-class fine art. This integration is so absolute that the only way for owners to access the BTC they have funded within is to destroy the art. That is the Kialara\u2019s paradox\u2014 and it\u2019s genius. The Kialara provides not only an unprecedented level of physical protection, but also powerful aesthetic and psychological motivation to hold onto one\u2019s crypto fortune."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have been on a roller coaster ride in recent years, with extreme volatility and unpredictable price swings.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin (BTC) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) are two cryptocurrencies that have shown resilience in the market and are poised to drive the next bull run.\n\nIn this article, we will explore three reasons why these two cryptocurrencies have the potential to be major players in the upcoming cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) \u2013 The King of Cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization that far exceeds any other cryptocurrency. Its history of resilience, withstanding multiple market crashes, has earned it the nickname \u201cdigital gold.\u201d Additionally, the current macroeconomic environment, with unprecedented levels of money printing and inflation, has made Bitcoin an attractive hedge against inflation.\n\nMoreover, institutional adoption of Bitcoin has been on the rise. Companies such as Tesla, Square, and MicroStrategy have invested billions of dollars in Bitcoin, adding credibility and mainstream appeal to the cryptocurrency. The entry of large institutional investors and banks into the Bitcoin market has brought a new level of legitimacy and stability to the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event, which will reduce the block reward for miners by half, will further reduce the supply of Bitcoin, potentially leading to an increase in demand and a price rise.\n\nAfter the anticipated last bitcoin halving in 2040, block rewards will no longer be in the form of bitcoin. Instead, miners will receive fees from users of the network who buy and sell bitcoin, providing them with incentives to continue processing transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) \u2013 An AI-Driven Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Platform\n\nRenQ Finance (RENQ) is a relatively new cryptocurrency that has been gaining popularity due to its unique features and strong community support. RENQ is an AI-driven decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aims to provide users with a high level of security, transparency, and speed. The platform allows users to earn interest on their investments and provides them with access to a range of financial products and services.\n\nOne of the key features of RenQ Finance is its low transaction fees and fast transaction times, making it an attractive option for those looking to participate in DeFi. RENQ holders have voting rights and can shape the direction of the platform, adding a layer of community governance to the platform.\n\nRenQ Finance has also been making significant strides in expanding its ecosystem, with several partnerships and collaborations. Moreover, RenQ Finance\u2019s partnership with CertiK, a leading blockchain security company, has provided investors with an added layer of security, making it a trustworthy investment option.\n\n>>>>> BUY RENQ TOKENS HERE <<<<<\n\n3 Reasons why Bitcoin (BTC) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) will drive the next bull run\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) are two cryptocurrencies that have gained a lot of attention in recent years. Both have unique features that make them stand out in the crowded cryptocurrency market. Here are three reasons why these two cryptocurrencies are expected to drive the next bull run:\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Halving Event\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. This scarcity is maintained through a process called mining, which involves solving complex mathematical equations to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. However, the number of new coins that can be mined per block is halved approximately every four years. This event is known as the Bitcoin halving, and it is designed to slow down the rate at which new coins are created and help maintain the scarcity of Bitcoin. The previous two halving events in 2012 and 2016 were followed by significant price increases, and experts expect the next halving in 2024 to have a similar effect on the price of Bitcoin.\n\nInstitutional Adoption\n\nOne of the main drivers of the current bull run is the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors. Large companies like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square have all invested significant amounts of their treasuries into Bitcoin, citing it as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. This trend is expected to continue as more companies recognize the benefits of owning cryptocurrencies and seek to diversify their portfolios.\n\nRenQ Finance also has the potential for institutional adoption due to its focus on governance and community engagement. The platform\u2019s strong emphasis on transparency and accountability makes it an attractive investment option for institutional investors looking for secure and reliable investment opportunities.\n\nGrowing Demand\n\nThe demand for cryptocurrencies is steadily increasing, driven by factors like increasing inflation, geopolitical instability, and the growing popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. As more people recognize the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies, the demand for them is likely to increase, driving up their prices.\n\nRenQ Finance is uniquely positioned to benefit from this growing demand due to its user-friendly interface and simple investment process. The platform\u2019s focus on community engagement and governance also makes it an attractive option for investors looking for a cryptocurrency that prioritizes transparency and accountability.\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin and RenQ Finance are two cryptocurrencies that are expected to drive the next bull run. The Bitcoin halving event, institutional adoption, and growing demand are all factors that are likely to contribute to their success in the coming years.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nPresale: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Are We in a Bitcoin Supercycle? - Money.ca",
        "content": "In this article\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the price surge in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and is it sustainable? Many believe we\u2019re actually in the middle of a Bitcoin supercycle. This is an exciting time to be an investor in cryptocurrency, but you should have an understanding of what\u2019s going on before you jump in.\n\nBitcoin has entered a new stage of mainstream acceptance. Now more than ever, it\u2019s seen as a legitimate investment that can deliver real value. Bitcoin is gradually becoming less of a speculative investment and more of a form of asset storage. Just as you diversify your portfolio across different financial securities and different currencies, you should consider diversifying into cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin is only growing in accessibility, acceptance, and utility. More e-commerce stores are adding cryptocurrency as an acceptable form of payment, and there are constantly more ways to spend your Bitcoin, such as with cards that work at brick-and-mortar stores. Recently the first Bitcoin ETF was approved in Canada, making Bitcoin accessible to investors on the traditional stock exchange.\n\nWhat is a supercycle?\n\nA supercycle is a phenomenon where the bullish increase in the price of a market security causes its price to increase further.\n\nThink of it as a positive feedback loop: people become interested in an investment so they start buying it, which drives up the price, and that makes more people confident about it and encourages them to buy more so the price goes up further, and so on.\n\nTypically, the term \u2018supercycle\u2019 is used to refer to a decades-long bullish run of commodities, but lately many financial analysts have been applying the term to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has been incredibly popular over the past decade, but especially so since the COVID19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin has entered a new stage of mainstream acceptance. Now more than ever, it\u2019s seen as a legitimate investment that can deliver real value. Bitcoin is gradually becoming less of a speculative investment and more of a form of asset storage. Just as you diversify your portfolio across different financial securities and different currencies, you should consider diversifying into cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin is only growing in accessibility, acceptance, and utility. More e-commerce stores are adding cryptocurrency as an acceptable form of payment, and there are constantly more ways to spend your Bitcoin, such as with cards that work at brick-and-mortar stores. Recently the first Bitcoin ETF was approved in Canada, making Bitcoin accessible to investors on the traditional stock exchange.\n\nThe ever-increasing interest and investment in Bitcoin is driving its price higher. Furthermore, because it seems that more and more investors will be jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon, we can expect its price to continue to go up. This exactly why many are saying we\u2019re in the middle of a Bitcoin supercycle!\n\nHow COVID legitimized Bitcoin\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has hit everyone hard, but Bitcoin seems to be the exception. A global crisis that tanked the traditional stock market and brought the global economy to a standstill only served to showcase exactly how powerful cryptocurrency is. Where do you put your money when the world economy is in turmoil? The answer is in an asset that\u2019s free from cumbersome political and geographical hang-ups.\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency, in general, is one of the most useful ways to diversify your investments and store cash, because it\u2019s not tied to one country or currency. Bitcoin is the ultimate global asset and is being heralded as the \u201cGold 2.0\u201d on which the rest of our monetary system is based.\n\nBitcoin price predictions\n\nBitcoin traded under $1 per coin from 2009 to 2011. In 2013, it peaked at $1,242 only to crash back down to between $300 to $600 for the majority of the following 4 years. In 2017, we saw the first big run-up of Bitcoin, peaking at over $18,000 in December of that year. It experienced another pullback before getting pushed to a new high in 2020 and it\u2019s continued its climb ever since. Bitcoin is now valued at over $58,000 USD and still headed higher.\n\nThe Winklevoss twins have been bullish on crypto since the beginning and insist it\u2019s going to $500,000. More modest estimates peg it at $200,000 to $250,000 for 2021, and others still insist it will eventually hit $1 million. Only time will tell who is right, but the general consensus is that Bitcoin is going to continue to go up for the foreseeable future.\n\nAre we currently in a Bitcoin supercycle?\n\nIt\u2019s been around since 2009, but Bitcoin is still a very new financial security with a relatively short price history. Because of this, it\u2019s difficult to reliably assess patterns in Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that we are in the middle of a Bitcoin supercycle.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market cycle appears to be about 4 years long, consisting of a run-up followed by a dramatic pull-back. This market cycle is centred around Bitcoin halving events which happen approximately every 4 years. A \u201chalving event\u201d is when the reward of mining new Bitcoin blocks drops by 50%. This will continue until all 21 million Bitcoins are mined. We just completed one of these halving events in 2020, which means we are again at the beginning of another 4-year Bitcoin market cycle.\n\nThe Bitcoin market cycle consists of four distinct phases: accumulation, continuation, parabolic, and correction. Here\u2019s a breakdown of each:\n\nAccumulation phase\n\nAs you may guess from the name, this is when investors accumulate Bitcoin. This phase happened at Bitcoin\u2019s launch, and also occurs following the phase of the Bitcoin market cycle, the correction phase. The accumulation phase is the best time to buy Bitcoin in order to maximize overall returns.\n\nContinuation phase\n\nAs investors accumulate Bitcoin, the price gets pushed higher until it enters its continuation phase. The Bitcoin halving events occur in the continuation phase, spurring a new wave of accumulation that kicks off the parabolic phase.\n\nParabolic phase\n\nThe parabolic phase is marked by Bitcoin hitting all-new highs in price. Many investors will capture profits, selling partial or all of their holdings, which can result in significant price corrections. This phase is marked by extreme volatility!\n\nCorrection phase\n\nAfter all the excitement of the parabolic phase, Bitcoin is due for a correction. Historically Bitcoin has seen an average 80% price drop during the correction phase, so when this hits, expect it to hurt.\n\nWhere are we now?\n\nWe are now in the parabolic phase of the Bitcoin market cycle which is always defined by extreme volatility and investor euphoria. It\u2019s an exciting and profitable time to invest! The parabolic phase will be followed by a correction phase, in which we will see a dramatic pullback in Bitcoin\u2019s price. However, there\u2019s no way of knowing yet what all-time high Bitcoin will hit before the pullback phase begins.\n\nGiven the growing interest in Bitcoin by institutional and retail investors alike, as well as the increase in the availability of products and platforms to invest in Bitcoin, all signs point to the price continuing to go up. No matter what, 2021 will be a very exciting time to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nHow to invest during a Bitcoin supercycle\n\nWhen it comes to investing in a supercycle, the sooner you get in, the better. The very nature of a supercycle is continuous bullish price movement, which means you\u2019re likely to see your investment continue to go up.\n\nIf you\u2019re not already investing in Bitcoin, now is the time to start. You can begin with as little cash as you can spare, and use a trading app to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies right on your mobile device. You have no excuse to stay on the sidelines anymore!\n\nWealthsimple Crypto also offers one of the best and easiest to use platforms for buying cryptocurrency. There\u2019s no minimum balance required to open an account, and you can invest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. If you\u2019re already a Wealthsimple Trade user, you\u2019ll find it super simple to toggle between the traditional stock market and the cryptocurrency exchange platform.\n\nWhen it comes to investing in Bitcoin during a supercycle, the same strategy that works for all your investments is applicable here: invest small amounts that you can afford on a consistent basis. Putting $100 into Bitcoin every week or two is more than enough to enjoy the rewards of investing in cryptocurrency without breaking the bank.\n\nIs the end of a supercycle a super crash?\n\nYou might be thinking the only possible end to a Bitcoin supercycle is a dramatic pullback, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly less likely we will see the same dramatic dips characteristic of Bitcoin in the past. While it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see many dramatic dips of 20% (or more) in Bitcoin\u2019s price, its general trend will continue upward for 2021.\n\nIn the coming months and years, expect to see Bitcoin increasingly accepted at your favourite stores, and more readily available as an investment product at your bank or brokerage. You may be paying for your morning takeout coffee with Bitcoin by the end of the year!\n\nWe will be due for a price correction at the end of the parabolic phase of the Bitcoin market cycle, but that seems to be a ways away yet. And when it does happen, it\u2019s really just a time to buy more.\n\nWhat does this mean for the Canadian investor?\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency are here to stay, and if you don\u2019t add some to your portfolio you run the risk of being left behind. But don\u2019t forget to balance your hopes and dreams with your tolerance for risk! Now is not the time to move all of your money out of traditional investments like stocks and bonds and into cryptocurrency. But it is a great time to start investing in Bitcoin and enjoy a great upside over the long term.\n\nRecommended reads:"

        "content": "It's a new era for Dough From Dough pizzeria in Gloucester, as from Wednesday 15 March 2023, diners can pay for their pizza using Bitcoin.\n\nThe pizza joint on Westgate Street is the first in the county to accept the cryptocurrency as payment, alongside traditional methods.\n\nCryptocurrencies have hit the headlines for their popularity amongst disillusioned workers who have seen their hard earned savings diluted by inflation.\n\nBitcoin's promise of a finite monetary supply that cannot be tampered with by governments and bankers has seen investors around the globe ploughing their savings into the digital currency, instead of relying on saving accounts they've seen being eroded over the years.\n\nThat's what Dough From Dough owner, Dan Snowdon, is keen to tap into, as he hopes to attract diners not just from around the county, but from across the world.\n\nThe 36-year-old chef said: 'We wanted to make a move that was going to encourage people from outside Gloucester into the city. I discovered there was a huge community of people out there who want to spend their Bitcoin on physical goods, so I thought why not!\n\n'People are making hundreds, if not thousands a day, investing in Bitcoin or trading Bitcoin, so I thought why not give them a place to spend it?\n\n'The fact no one else is doing it is a perfect opportunity for me to get in before the rush and be the first.\n\n'I hope it brings in a lot of customers who wouldn\u2019t have chosen us unless we offered this service.\n\n'My hope has always been to create a place where people will come into the city centre from all over the world to try our pizza.'\n\nThe Gloucester Rugby fan created a hub for rugby and food when he took over the pizza restaurant, which was formerly known as Hooker & Eight.\n\nNow called Dough From Dough, the restaurant serves pizzas with memorable names including the Cherry and White Margherita; the Sin Bin created by rugby player, Lewis Ludlow; the Green Green Grass of 'Holm; as well as the provocative Cheltenham Average - a jokey tribute to the veg supreme supermarket classic.\n\nSeating up to 40 diners in its pizzeria, it also does takeaways which diners can pay for in Bitcoin too.\n\nIt's open from Wednesday to Saturday for dinner, with lunch served from Thursday to Saturday, too."

        "content": "Introduction Cryptocurrency has undeniably gained popularity in recent years. With no indication of slowing down, Bitcoin, the first and most well-known digital money, is leading\u2026\n\nIntroduction\n\nCryptocurrency has undeniably gained popularity in recent years. With no indication of slowing down, Bitcoin, the first and most well-known digital money, is leading this new financial revolution. To invest in bitcoins, you can visit online trading platforms like thequantumai.app\n\nHowever, what exactly is it about Bitcoin that has others so curious? What makes it unique?\n\nThis essay will look more closely at the justifications for blockchain as the future\u2019s money. We\u2019ll examine the top five reasons people think Bitcoin will skyrocket in popularity and value over the following years.\n\nReasons Why Bitcoin Is a Good Alternative to Fiat Money\n\nOne of the strongest justifications for understanding Bitcoin\u2019s potential and how it may develop into the money of the future is that it offers a competitive alternative to fiat money. Governments issue fiat money, which may be accepted as legal cash and has a fixed value.\n\nBitcoin is a substitute for fiat money because\n\nIt is decentralized since no one entity is in charge of determining its worth or how widely it is used.\n\nWith just 21 million BTC ever generated and no other BTC currencies issued after that, it has built-in scarcity.\n\nIt establishes confidence between two parties by having an accessible public ledger that anybody can use to audit transactions.\n\nBecause of its cryptographic nature, transactions are safe, quick, and affordable.\n\nBecause of its immutability, transactions that have already been performed cannot be changed or reversed.\n\nOne of bitcoin\u2019s most intriguing qualities is its ability to function as a different currency. We could develop a payment system that is safer and more effective by creating a system that does not depend on a central authority or middleman for its legitimacy.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s advantages in terms of security and transparency\n\nBitcoin is the most secure currency out there. It is mainly impervious to censorship and theft since no reserve bank or a single controller can control the system. Every Bitcoin transaction is cryptographically protected inside the blockchain, a decentralized database almost hard to hack or alter.\n\nAlso, the blockchain makes all Bitcoin transactions visible to the public and verifiable. As a result, every transaction can be checked for accuracy and traced as it travels across the network. Traditional national banks cannot provide the amount of visibility into financial operations at any moment that this level of openness affords financial entities, such as banks and governments.\n\nTo sum up, Bitcoin has the following benefits over conventional fiat currencies in terms of security and transparency:\n\nThe network is entirely decentralized using Bitcoin, with no one entity in charge.\n\nIt is resistant to hacking attempts thanks to cryptography.\n\nProspects for Growth and Competition of Bitcoin\n\nOne of its most fascinating features is the potential for the expansion and disruption of Bitcoin. Technology is transforming banking, government, finance, and our way of life. The top five reasons why Cryptocurrency will eventually replace fiat money are listed below.\n\nSimple and Safe Transactions\n\nUnlike conventional currencies, which depend on intermediaries like banks or financial organizations to monitor transactions, Bitcoin enables risk-free direct money transfers between users. It\u2019s safe, quick, and inexpensive in fees or paperwork.\n\nLow costs\n\nSince no intermediaries are involved, bitcoin transactions are inexpensive compared to conventional money transfer networks like credit cards. The result might be significant cost reductions for both consumers and businesses.\n\nSecurity of Identity\n\nBitcoin provides an unmatched degree of identity security compared to conventional payment methods since it runs on a distributed platform where all operations are secured and protected. It means you won\u2019t need to be concerned about disclosing your account details or personal information each time you make an online transaction.\n\nPossibility of Growth\n\nBitcoin\u2019s potential for disruption increases dramatically as more businesses adopt it, and it continues to gain popularity. It may result in a whole new financial structure that puts more power back in the hands of the people rather than being governed by major institutions or governments.\n\nTransparency\n\nHow individuals spend their money and who sends them users may find money simply by looking at the public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions. It enables us to monitor information previously unattainable with other conventional currencies, giving us a greater insight into how money moves across our ecosystem on a macro level.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Bit is a powerful decentralized asset with the potential to become the world\u2019s next primary reserve currency. With its tight supply restrictions, rising demand, secure network, and affordable fees, Cryptocurrency has much room for growth. With its enormous popularity and acceptance, Bitcoin will probably remain a well-liked digital asset.\n\nThe ideal method for anybody interested in Bitcoin to become engaged is to learn about the asset, comprehend the concept and its possibilities, and then purchase some BTC. It will provide the person access to electronic support and allow them to use its fantastic potential."

        "content": "OpenAI\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) platform ChatGPT has proven its usefulness in providing information on a wide range of topics, including the cryptocurrency sector, and its newest iteration was able to list all the reasons why the existence of Bitcoin (BTC) was necessary.\n\nIndeed, Michael Saylor, who is the founder and chairman of the enterprise analytics platform MicroStrategy, has asked GPT-4 why the world needed Bitcoin, and the AI platform has provided him with a detailed response containing eight specific reasons, as quoted by Saylor in a tweet published on March 15.\n\nFrom decentralization and accessibility to security\n\nAs the primary argument for the flagship digital asset, ChatGPT placed decentralization \u2013 the fact that no single entity, like government or financial institution, can control it, in turn providing more freedom, autonomy, and resistance to censorship and manipulation.\n\nSecondly, the AI tool singled out Bitcoin\u2019s ability to provide access to financial services to unbanked and underbanked individuals, such as in regions with limited or unavailable traditional banking systems, who only need a smartphone and internet access to use the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the third place are the fees of Bitcoin transactions that can be lower \u201ccompared to traditional financial services, especially for cross-border transactions,\u201d as ChatGPT highlighted, stressing this can also reduce costs for both customers and businesses involved in international transfers.\n\nFurthermore, \u201cBitcoin transactions are recorded on a public, tamper-resistant ledger called the blockchain,\u201d so \u201ctransactions can be easily verified and traced, reducing the risk of fraud and corruption.\u201d\n\nDeflationary, private, and programmable\n\nAs the chatbot also correctly observed, Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million BTC, which makes it a deflationary currency, reducing the risk of inflation, which tends to \u201cerode the purchasing power of traditional currencies over time.\u201d\n\nThe sixth pro-Bitcoin argument listed by GPT-4 was the greater degree of privacy when transferring assets compared to traditional transactions, thanks to the crypto transfers only being linked to a public address instead of sensitive personal information.\n\nIn the seventh place is Bitcoin\u2019s value as an investment and a method of diversification of financial portfolios, as the AI tool noted that the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) asset by market cap had demonstrated its \u201cpotential for significant growth in value over time.\u201d\n\nLast but not least, is the fact that:\n\n\u201cBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies enable programmable money through smart contracts, which can automate and streamline various financial processes and transactions, leading to increased efficiency and new business models.\u201d\n\nBullish future?\n\nBitcoin already has many believers in its bullish future who are well aware of its advantages, including Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the best-selling personal finance book \u2018Rich Dad Poor Dad,\u2019 who has long argued for Bitcoin as the alternative to the United States dollar, which he considers \u201cfake money\u201d and a threat to the economy.\n\nAt the same time, the maiden crypto has recently hit new multi-month highs and has demonstrated chart patterns and indicators suggesting that another bull run was in play after a period of uncertainty, having kicked off with a potential target of $1 million in the next couple of years, as Finbold reported."
