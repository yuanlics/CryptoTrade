        "content": "Although hovering around the $100 range since mid-2022, Bitcoin Cash has skyrocketed after it was listed by a new crypto exchange that\u2019s backed by big-time TradFi players\u2014Citadel Securities, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab.\n\nThe new exchange, EDX Markets, offered only four cryptocurrencies at launch: Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. The price of Bitcoin Cash has more than doubled over the past week since the announcement, trading near $235 as of Tuesday morning. The coin\u2019s price was up nearly 20% over the past 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin Cash got a boost when it was not named a security in the Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase filed earlier this month. EDX listing the token has given investors more confidence that regulators may be ignoring it.\n\nIn a 2018 video from a crypto event hosted by Bloomberg and Fidelity, now-SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said Bitcoin Cash, along with two other EDX-listed cryptocurrencies, Litecoin and Ether, were not securities. That statement differed from the SEC chairman\u2019s oft-repeated stance that every crypto except Bitcoin is a security.\n\nBitcoin Cash was created following a dispute between Bitcoin\u2019s users and developers over different visions for the future of the blockchain. In 2017, a group that wanted Bitcoin to focus more on consumer payments split, or forked, the blockchain to create Bitcoin Cash.\n\nDespite being valued at vastly less than its namesake\u2014Bitcoin was trading near $30,700 on Tuesday morning\u2014Bitcoin Cash is still a top 20 cryptocurrency, with a market cap above $4.5 billion."

        "content": "More than $3 million worth of Bitcoin just moved after 13 years of dormancy. Two wallets holding 50 BTC each, mined back in 2010, were moved to different wallets.\n\nIt is unclear who the owners of the cryptocurrency are but they are the sixth and seventh whales to have moved large quantities of BTC this year.\n\nThe movements come as the price of the largest digital asset soars following renewed institutional investor interest. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up nearly 15% in seven days, trading hands for $30,381, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe term \"whales\" refers to investors who hoard huge amounts of Bitcoin and don\u2019t touch it for years.\n\nSuch investors\u2014also known as \u201cHODLers\u201d\u2014are the most successful. Those who buy BTC and sell it quickly usually lose out, while those who buy it and sit on it for years tend to make a profit.\n\nThis is because Bitcoin experiences short-term volatility but in the long-term its price has appreciated massively. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap back in July 2010 was worth a fraction of a cent.\n\nDr. Kirill Kretov, a developer of tools for automated trading and blockchain analyst, previously told Decrypt that Bitcoin mined back in 2010 was probably down to computer experts experimenting with the technology but that it was hard to know whether the Bitcoin had since landed in the hands of commercial entities.\n\n\"There is this unique spirit of crypto anarchy and technological pioneering behind such elder addresses,\" Kretov told Decrypt. \"It's like a way-back machine, and thousands of people are left to speculate about why those bitcoins were transferred now.\"\n\nHe also mentioned that there's a theory that \"elder\" whale wallets shift BTC to send each other signals about when it's time to pump the price of the world's oldest and largest cryptocurrency.\n\n\"There are some researchers who take notes on price charts about those awakenings, trying to predict the future price,\" he said. \"Luckily, I'm not one of those.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOther whale movements include a holder in April who hadn\u2019t touched their coins for a decade shuffling $7.8 million-worth of BTC to new wallets.\n\nNumber of Bitcoin Whales Drops to Lowest Level Since 2019\n\nAnd just last week, a long-term investor moved 50 BTC after 11 years of inactivity to a new wallet."

        "content": "Forget caffeine, tobacco and any other stimulants the normies might be into. Nothing gets you going like the thrill of the shill. You\u2019re not a whale, but you aspire to be. Your free time is spent instigating fights with ETH maxis on Crypto Twitter and praying the bottom is in. You bleed bitcoin.\n\nAnd now you can level up your passion for the space and take a dip in water that, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is from the Fountain of Youth: Bath water warmed by the blood, sweat and tears of hard-working bitcoin miners.\n\nOh no, this is no joke. Bathhouse in Brooklyn (a bathhouse in Brooklyn) is keeping its pools nice and toasty thanks to its bitcoin mining operation.\n\nHeat is a byproduct of the computing power required to mine bitcoin. The spa uses heat exchangers to transfer the heat from their ASICs to the water, according to Bathhouse. As water cools, it is circulated back to the miners to be warmed up again. Recycling at its finest.\n\nThe spa shared details of its joint mining-heating operation on social media this week, and some of their patrons were less than enthused, calling the project \u201cunhinged,\u201d \u201coff-putting\u201d and \u201cso cringe.\u201d\n\nTo be frank, get rekt. It\u2019s bitcoin juice. If I lived in New York, I\u2019d buy the $55 day pass just to drink the stuff. It\u2019s just as silly to spend time worrying about these miners\u2019 environmental and financial impact as it is to heat your pools with bitcoin in the first place.\n\nBut heating pools in Brooklyn isn\u2019t the only way to make full use of your miners. Hey, I get it. Not everyone is a big public pool person. But the opportunities to maximize your miners\u2019 true potential are only limited by the scope of your creativity.\n\nWhite noise machine \u2014 Having trouble sleeping? Look no further than the trusty Antminer. The incessant squeaking from a nearby train yard has me tossing and turning all night. I could run a rig on my bedside table, right next to my casual bedtime read \u2014 War and Peace. The constant din would give me some of the deepest REM cycles of my life.\n\nI\u2019d also imagine that a miner will work wonders lulling your fussy infant to sleep. Added benefit: The mechanical vibes will be right at home in the ever-popular cyberpunk-themed nursery.\n\nYour favorite veggies, year round \u2014 Set up a few miners in your greenhouse, and the heat thrown by these suckers could take your little radishes to new heights. Your neighbors will start asking for your secret, and you can tell them the truth: \u201cA little satoshi here, a little bitcoin there.\u201d\n\nAir Bitcoin \u2014 You\u2019re reclined in first class, sipping on a glass of champagne. The plane engine, albeit loud, is moving you along at 500 miles an hour. You\u2019re pondering your in-flight movie options. Should you go with a classic? They do have your favorite, the 2004 smash hit Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2. The person assigned to the seat next to you never showed up, and you have all the legroom you could want.\n\nSomeone gently taps you on the shoulder, must be the flight attendant. You slide the silky face mask off of your eyes, and surprise! You\u2019re not going to Bali. You\u2019re in your living room, sitting in a lawn chair, clutching a sweating bottle of Miller Lite. The calming hum of the airplane you were enjoying just moments ago? Mining rigs, making your in-flight fantasies a reality.\n\nNo-no Ma \u2014 Tired of your neighbor kid practicing F\u00fcr Elise on the cello? Point a couple of miners in the right direction, and show that kid who\u2019s the real neighborhood noisemaker.\n\nA quick list, but talk about real-world use cases! I\u2019m starting to think you could use the heat to power an at-home foot spa. Frying an egg is a solid option, albeit uninspired. Maybe I\u2019ll try jumping rope with the extra long cables? Through bitcoin, all things are possible.\n\nHannah Finnerty is Blockworks\u2019 editorial operations manager and is based in the US.

        "content": "Bitcoin dipped but held above the US$30,000 threshold on Monday morning in Asia, with nearly all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies rising. The gains follow a number of traditional financial institutions showing interest in launching crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the U.S. securities regulator approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs in the country on Friday. In the NFT market, a whale has been selling off Bored Ape Yacht Clubs.\n\nBitcoin little changed\n\nBitcoin edged down 0.35% to US$30,444 over the last 24 hours to 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose 15.44% in the past seven days.\n\nEther gained 1.18% to US$1,898, with a 10.32% weekly gain.\n\nPolkadot led gains among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies with a 3.28% 24-hour rise to post a weekly gain of 14.28%. Beside Bitcoin, Litecoin was the only token on the list edging lower, dropping 1.48% over the past 24 hours but up 14.24% for the week.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the nation\u2019s first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF offered by Florida-based Volatility Shares, CoinDesk reported. The \u201c2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF\u201d is set to start trading on June 27 on CBOE BZX Exchange, according to the fund\u2019s website.\n\nThe ETF will not invest directly in Bitcoin but seek to benefit from increases in the price of Bitcoin futures contracts for a single day, according to its prospectus. The fund will correspond to two times the return of the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll index.\n\nThis comes after BlackRock and WisdomTree recently filed applications with the SEC to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. The regulator has given a greenlight to a number of futures-based crypto ETFs but has not approved spot products.\n\n\u201cThe turbulences of 2022 have led to a decline in confidence in crypto-native institutions, presenting traditional financial institutions with a prime opportunity to enter the crypto market,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast last week.\n\nAdditionally, New York-headquartered investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. launched euro-denominated transactions on its blockchain-based payment system, JPM Coin, Bloomberg reported on Friday.\n\nJPM Coin allows clients to transfer euros or dollars held with their JPMorgan accounts immediately and at any time of the day, unlike traditional banking transactions that usually operate during business hours.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club dump\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.25% to 2,905.28 in the 24 hours to 9:40 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index, however, is up 1.08% for the week.\n\nNFT transactions on Ethereum fell 2.49% over the past 24 hours to US$18.38 million, while transactions on the Bitcoin network surged 138% to US$3.6 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\n\u201cEthereum is still struggling with tumbling prices, especially in Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) whose average sales price remains in the low- to mid-US$70,000 range,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nOver the past few days, NFT whale Jeffrey Huang, also known as Machi, has dumped dozens of his BAYC holdings. On Saturday, Machi sold 19 BAYC NFTs in one transaction on marketplace Blur for 651.56 Ether, or roughly US$1.22 million.\n\nThe floor price of BAYC stood at 37.4 Ether on Blur on Monday morning in Asia, gaining 4.18% over the past day but losing 13.52% over the past week.\n\nSales of BAYC jumped 26.11% over the past 24 hours to US$3.43 million, adding to weekly sales of US$13.11 million. BAYC was the most-sold collection for the past day and week in terms of transaction value.\n\nEthereum-based Azuki NFT transactions rose 25.68% in the past 24 hours to US$3.07 million, the highest after BAYC.\n\nAzuki\u2019s floor price on Blur rose 1.78% in the past day but was down 9.21% for the week.\n\nU.S. stock futures rise\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin. Image: Wikimedia Commons\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher as of 10:40 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.19%, and S&P 500 futures added 0.24%. Nasdaq Futures rose 0.32%.\n\nEquity markets across Asia were mostly mixed with investors unsettled by events in Russia over the weekend when Wagner Group mercenaries marched toward Moscow in what appeared to be a rebellion against the military leadership.\n\nThe group later halted the advance, but it raised concern about instability in Russia as it may undermine the leadership of President Vladimir Putin. Oil prices rose on concern about supply disruptions from Russia, the world\u2019s third-largest producer of crude oil.\n\nIn macroeconomic developments, Japan\u2019s services producer price index rose 1.6% year-on-year in May, according to official data released Monday.\n\n\u201cJapan\u2019s economy, despite being affected by factors such as past high commodity prices, has picked up as private consumption, for example, has increased moderately,\u201d the Bank of Japan said Monday in the summary of opinions of June 15-16 monetary policy meetings.\n\nOn U.S. inflation and interest rates, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank is in consensus on the need for more interest rate hikes this year.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 71.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, and a 28.1% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged at the next meeting on July 26.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

        "title": "BlackRock\u2019s ETF application led to the biggest crypto inflows in a year. But how much Wall Street influence is too much? - Fortune",
        "content": "After a year of falling prices, SEC lawsuits, and company failures, news of BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application earlier this month was a welcome reprieve: Bitcoin hit a 52-week high.\n\nThe news helped fuel the highest inflows to cryptocurrencies in a year\u2014nearly $200 million, according to a report by CoinShares\u2014but that\u2019s not without risk. Despite support from the market, BlackRock still faces an uphill battle. The Securities and Exchange Commission has never approved a spot Bitcoin ETF, rejecting at least 30 attempts in the past, according to Bloomberg, mostly because the agency says it\u2019s concerned about market manipulation.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, along with any others that get approved, may lead to a rush of investment and a new bull market that sends the price of Bitcoin soaring. At the same time, market players say Wall Street effectively controlling millions of tokens as portfolio assets could give TradFi firms outsize influence over the space.\n\nIncluding even one-third of all Bitcoin in financial products could be harmful to the overall network, causing it to deviate from its original purpose, said Steven Lubka, head of Swan Private at Swan Bitcoin, a financial services firm.\n\n\u201cYou always want to see a world where a healthy amount of people own Bitcoin and self-custody and use it directly, for the network to kind of truly maintain what is, in my opinion, its original purpose\u2014and what gives it value,\u201d he told Fortune.\n\nThere\u2019s also the risk that BlackRock and its peers could use their influence to push for changes to the underlying Bitcoin blockchain, such as pushing for a \u201cfork\u201d that would create two separate cryptocurrencies, Lubka added. Bitcoin was forked once before, after users and developers disagreed over its future, resulting in the creation of a new coin, Bitcoin Cash.\n\nIf there was another fork, BlackRock\u2019s ETF prospectus says it gets to decide which of the two cryptocurrencies is the \u201creal Bitcoin,\u201d despite what investors or other users of the blockchain think, Lubka said. This likely would lead the firm to dump all of its holdings in whichever coin isn\u2019t selected.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re sitting on 5 million Bitcoin, that means they\u2019re going to sell 5 million of the other fork,\u201d Lubka said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to tank the price.\u201d\n\nOthers like Jay Jog, cofounder of Sei Labs, disagree. Jog said Wall Street firms may gain more influence with the approval of these ETFs, but it\u2019s doubtful companies like BlackRock would push for major changes to Bitcoin because of the myriad potential legal and financial implications.\n\n\u201cThese entities, they\u2019re going to have so much money at stake,\u201d Jog told Fortune, \u201cthat even if there is the possibility for them to act maliciously by taking advantage of their stake in the network, from an economic standpoint, it makes no sense for them to do that.\u201d\n\nWhile there is some risk, both Lubka and Jog ultimately believe that the entry of traditional financial firms is something that will benefit Bitcoin\u2014and crypto overall.\n\nThe entry of traditional financial firms to the market has often spurred big inflows. When ProShares, the manager of several traditional finance ETFs, launched one of the first Bitcoin futures ETFs, in 2021, there was an influx of $1 billion into digital assets in a single week, according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.\n\nOn the back of the spot ETF application by BlackRock, Invesco and WisdomTree each filed its own, soon followed by that $199 million deluge of inflows\u201494% of which went into Bitcoin\u2014according to CoinShares.\n\n\u201cParticipation among institutional investors has been scant so far, mainly due to reputation concerns associated with such investments,\u201d Butterfill told Fortune in an email. \u201cBut now, with BlackRock deciding to launch an ETF, many anticipate other institutions to follow suit.\u201d"

        "content": "Wall Street players are now backing crypto as institutional investors show support for bitcoin ETFs. Yahoo Finance crypto reporter David Hollerith checks out bitcoin's year-to-date performance and the outlook for bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Crypto prices lower today but momentum has been strong this year. And now some of the biggest names in finance are making new bets on cryptocurrencies adding competition and momentum to the space. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith has more on that story. And David, nothing like a boost of confidence from Wall Street to get investors bullish on crypto again.\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Akiko, the big finance player moves that we've seen in the last two weeks obviously started with BlackRock filing an ETF. We also saw ETX markets begin trading. And they're backed by Fidelity Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities. And that's a new crypto exchange that doesn't interact with individuals but serves more like a traditional exchange.\n\nAnd then we have Deutsche Bank also applying to custody crypto assets. And outside of BlackRock, a lot of these moves were previously telegraphed as far back as a year. But obviously, this came at a really good time, I guess you would say for the space, just given that a lot of this year so far the story has been regulatory enforcements in the US leading to lawsuits. And that's still a lot of what we're looking at to determine where things are going.\n\nRegulation, of course, in the US is a really big deal. But we've seen obviously-- the Bitcoin price has surged a lot and then the total crypto market cap has followed along with that. And we've seen even just higher inflows into Bitcoin associated exchange traded products. So there's a lot of enthusiasm about this. Most of it actually was previously reported but I think that it highlights-- it's a reminder that cryptocurrency hasn't gone away as much as it might seem sometimes.\n\nAnd we see earlier this month, in fact, the SEC filing charges against the two largest crypto exchanges in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: And David, to that point, at least up until this point when you take into account the massive run that we've seen in the price of Bitcoin up what about 80% year to date. It hasn't yet had a massive impact but I guess you can make the argument that it's coming off a very depressed level after the implosion of FTX. But what do you think are the key things that investors need to watch for when they're trying to figure out where Bitcoin, where crypto is headed in the second half?\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah. Always a good question. I think it's fair to think about it this way, which is that regulation has really dominated cryptocurrency asset prices. Maybe Bitcoin the least but still Bitcoin has sagged on bad regulatory news. So regulation is still going to be a major focus. But as things get cleared up, at least I think with the BlackRock and ETX announcements, there's a signal that US businesses or financial institutions, I should say, are still interested in getting involved in the space.\n\nAnd I think that brushes aside some of it. That being said, from what I've heard from crypto hopefuls in Washington, it sounds like there are two bills that are getting ready to be voted on in the House in July. And I've heard optimistically that one of those two bills could be passed in the House by the end of the year. There's a lot less optimism for what could happen in the Senate.\n\nAnd then that being said, the most important lawsuit as far as the ETF goes is the Grayscale lawsuit. Grayscale is suing the SEC for not approving its spot Bitcoin ETF or approving a conversion of its existing product. So the verdict for that case comes out at the beginning of September, and that's going to be really important. And we don't have the exact information, we don't know, but it'd be hard to imagine that the SEC would even consider approving an ETF before that verdict is reached.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: I know you'll be following those developments closely, David Hollerith, thank you."

        "content": "HSBC Hong Kong, the biggest bank in the special administrative region of China, is now permitting trades of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs.\n\nOn Monday, crypto outlets The Block and CoinTelegraph, citing a tweet from Chinese blockchain journalist Colin Wu, reported that HSBC had become the first bank there to let customers trade Bitcoin and Ether ETFs listed on Hong Kong\u2019s exchange.\n\nSCOOP: HSBC, the largest bank in Hong Kong, today allows its customers to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs listed on the Hong Kong exchange, and is also the first bank in Hong Kong to allow it. The move will expand local users\u2019 exposure to cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong. pic.twitter.com/vH0LieSVGw \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 26, 2023\n\nWu added in a tweet that some of the crypto ETFs listed in Hong Kong include the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF.\n\nThe news comes after the region\u2019s banking regulator earlier this month pressured several of the biggest banks in Hong Kong, including HSBC, to accept crypto exchanges as clients. In an April letter sent by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to the banks, the regulator said that due diligence should not create \u201can undue burden\u201d to accepting crypto clients, the Financial Times reported.\n\nHong Kong has recently warmed to crypto publicly, in contrast with the outwardly cold stance taken by leaders in mainland China. Earlier this month, Hong Kong instituted a licensing scheme for crypto exchanges and reinstated retail crypto trading for select cryptocurrencies.\n\nSome in the industry have speculated that Hong Kong\u2019s openness to crypto could eventually lead to a thaw in mainland China\u2019s cryptocurrency ban.\n\nMeanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing several applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF, including from the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock. The SEC has so far denied all such previous applications.\n\nCrypto industry players hailed the move on Monday. Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of crypto exchange Gemini, said in a tweet that the development was more evidence that Asia is overtaking the U.S. when it comes to crypto.\n\n\u201cHong Kong has just beat the USA to the punch on a bitcoin ETF\u2026and ether ETF,\u201d Winklevoss wrote.\n\nBitcoin and Ether on Monday morning were trading down, about 1%, near $30,300 and $1,800, respectively."

        "title": "Speculation mounts BlackRock bitcoin ETF will get green light - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nSpeculation that BlackRock will finally break the US regulators\u2019 decade-long resistance to exchange traded funds based on bitcoin has fuelled a rally in the token to its highest level in a year.\n\nOptimism among crypto traders has soared in the two weeks since the world\u2019s largest money manager filed an application to run the first publicly traded spot bitcoin ETF in the US. Bitcoin, the most popular digital token, has soared by a fifth to more than $30,000.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s application has pitted a group with a substantial record of ETF approvals against the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has repeatedly rejected industry efforts for an ETF based on trading in the underlying bitcoin asset.\n\nSupporters argue a cheap and regulated asset in the world\u2019s largest investment market would encourage more investors and hope the financial muscle of the asset manager will succeed where others have failed. The SEC has three months to assess the application.\n\n\u201cThe BlackRock ETF is likely to be approved,\u201d said Dave Weisberger, chief executive and co-founder of CoinRoutes, an algorithmic trading platform for the digital asset industry.\n\n\n\nBlackRock has \u201cpretty much undercut all the SEC\u2019s arguments other than \u2018meh, we don\u2019t like bitcoin\u2019, so I think they have a very reasonable chance,\u201d he added.\n\nDozens of asset managers have applied to launch such a fund since the Winklevoss twins, the entrepreneurs, made the first filing in 2013, when bitcoin was trading at about $1,000.\n\nDigital assets dashboard Click here for real-time data on crypto prices and insights\n\nThe SEC has yet to pass an application for an ETF based on the underlying bitcoin asset, which is traded on unregulated exchanges. The agency says it cannot offer investors guarantees the market is free from fraud and manipulation.\n\n\n\nThe only crypto-ETFs the US has approved are based on bitcoin futures contracts, which are listed and monitored on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a regulated market.\n\nBoth ETF and crypto markets are hoping to ride in BlackRock\u2019s slipstream. Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise, Ark Investment Management and Valkyrie have all had spot bitcoin ETF filings rejected in the past but have refiled their applications, with some modifications. Ark is ahead of BlackRock in the filing queue, with the SEC due to make a ruling on its application by August 13.\n\nThe discount to the net asset value of the $18.9bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world\u2019s largest crypto fund, has narrowed sharply to a nine-month low of 31.3 per cent. Grayscale is suing the SEC for its refusal to allow it to convert GBTC into an ETF, a move that, if allowed, would probably see the discount disappear.\n\nPart of the optimism stems from BlackRock\u2019s formidable record. According to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, the asset manager has had 575 filings approved by the SEC and only one rejection. He put the odds of approval on this occasion at 50-50. Both BlackRock and the SEC declined to comment.\n\nIts application is also subtly different from those that have gone before. The chief difference is that the Nasdaq exchange, where the iShares Bitcoin Trust would be listed, \u201cis expecting to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with an operator of a United States-based spot trading platform for bitcoin\u201d.\n\nIn previous rejections the SEC has said a deal on surveillance \u201cwith a regulated market of significant size\u201d was one way for an applicant to meet its obligations to prevent fraud and manipulation in the underlying market.\n\nCoinbase is the proposed custodian for the fund and widely expected to be BlackRock\u2019s chosen exchange.\n\n\u201cIf Nasdaq is able to enter into an agreement with an exchange such as Coinbase, that could theoretically clear a pathway towards approval since it would directly address the SEC\u2019s main concern\u201d, allowing regulators \u201cto monitor for and pursue bad actors\u201d, said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, a financial adviser.\n\nHowever, Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America, at Morningstar, felt BlackRock was only \u201cedging closer to addressing [the SEC\u2019s] concerns\u201d.\n\nWhile a surveillance-sharing effort with a cryptocurrency exchange \u201cis certainly better than having zero insight into the underlying market\u201d, he argued that manipulation could still be occurring on other exchanges, which would influence the price of bitcoin.\n\nGeraci suggested the new EDX Markets exchange, which launched this week, \u201ccould be the exact solution needed to get the SEC comfortable\u201d.\n\nThe marketplace is backed by Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities and only allows accredited members to trade on it, much like Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. But Geraci admitted it needed to generate sufficient volume for the SEC to consider it as \u201csignificant size\u201d.\n\nMoreover, the SEC also sued Coinbase this month, alleging it violated US securities law by failing to register as a broker, national securities exchange or clearing agency. Coinbase has vowed to fight the suit and continue as usual.\n\nClick here to visit Digital Asset dashboard\n\n\u201cThe SEC\u2019s reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America\u2019s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance,\u201d said Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer.\n\nArmour was unconvinced by the trust structure argument but retained an open mind.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s 575-to-1 record is \u201cthe only reason why we would expect it to be approved\u201d, he added. \u201cThere is a reputational risk that comes with the filing. You feel that they wouldn\u2019t do this if there wasn\u2019t a reason.\u201d"

The crackdown has had a limited impact on the token's price, which already bottomed out at around $25,000, according to Lee.\n\nAt the same time, the uncertainty has opened the door for some bigger names on Wall Street to enter the market. That includes the likes of BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, which this month filed with the SEC for the creation of a bitcoin ETF.\n\n\"There's been sort of a stage exit stage left for a lot of players, but then we've replaced them with, you know, some of the traditional players that have a lot of credibility,\" Lee said. \"Like the Blackrock and the Citadels coming into bitcoin.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNews of the ETF sent the token rallying over 21% from June's low. The coin is trading at around $30,626 on Monday.\n\nBitcoin also benefits from being a risk-on asset, he added, and given the the gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, historic trends show that the token is set to keep climbing.\n\nOver all, the cryptocurrency has been on a gradual, though volatile, rise in 2023. It jumped considerably in the spring, as decentralized assets like bitcoin looked more appealing during the banking turmoil sparked by the fall of Silicon Valley Bank in March."

About $187 million, or 94% of the total flows, went to Bitcoin. Total assets under management now stand at $37 billion \u2014 the highest since before the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, the data shows."

        "title": "What Does Blackrock's Bitcoin ETF Mean for Crypto? - Morningstar",
        "content": "Bryan Armour: BlackRock (BLK) shocked the financial world when it filed for the iShares Bitcoin Trust on June 15, becoming the most prominent filer for a spot Bitcoin ETF after years of rejection of the strategy by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The surprised filing came on the heels of the SEC's lawsuit against Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, making the timing in BlackRock's partnership with Coinbase and the filing even more odd.\n\nBlackrock Would Make Bitcoin Legitimate\n\nAs the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock would immediately give legitimacy to the Bitcoin market in need of it. Between the SEC's crackdown in high-fee, imperfect Bitcoin ETFs currently on the market, an iShares spot Bitcoin ETF would be a welcome facelift. Whether that means investors should buy this fund should it hit the market is another question. Bitcoin is highly volatile, and its future is uncertain. There's not a fundamental value to lean on for investors, so this consideration should outweigh all others, including fund structure. Aside from investment merit, it's worth understanding where a spot Bitcoin ETF would fit in with other offerings available in the U.S. Currently, the Bitcoin ETF market is composed of three types of funds \u2013 grantor trusts, futures-based ETFs, and Bitcoin-adjacent equity funds. A spot Bitcoin ETF like the one BlackRock is proposing would create a fourth bucket because it doesn't fit in the others.\n\nWho Are Blackrock's Competitors in the Bitcoin Space?\n\nCurrently, the largest Bitcoin offering in the U.S. is Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, ticker GBTC. It operates more like a closed-end fund than an ETF, meaning investors have faced large premiums and discounts in its price versus NAV that have nothing to do with Bitcoin. The iShares Bitcoin Trust would have continuous offerings like other ETFs, meaning authorized participants would be able to create and redeem shares at NAV at any time. This would help keep the ETF's price in line with its NAV. Grayscale currently doesn't allow redemptions. So, investors' only option is to sell at the prevailing price, which is currently heavily discounted.\n\nHow Will Blackrock's Bitcoin ETF Work?\n\nFutures-based Bitcoin ETFs do a better job of tracking Bitcoin's price, but they also introduce other differences from holding Bitcoin. First, the intention of these funds is to hold the front month futures contracts. But futures contracts expire. Each month, the portfolio managers must roll into the next month's futures contract, often at a slightly higher price. This creates an added cost for the fund that a spot Bitcoin ETF wouldn't incur. The exchange that lists Bitcoin futures, the CME, also imposes position limits to avoid any one firm from controlling too much of the market. Should that occur, as it did in 2021 when ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, ticker BITO, launched, the portfolio managers had to move further out on the futures curve by buying longer-dated futures contracts. A rule of thumb is the longer a futures contract has until expiration, the less closely it will track the asset spot market.\n\nIn terms of its ability to track the price of Bitcoin, a spot Bitcoin ETF like the one proposed by BlackRock would clearly be an upgrade over currently available options. It would likely also come with lower fees. Grayscale charges a 2% fee while BITO charges 95 basis points, and this is one cause for investors that's highly likely to improve should BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF come to market.\n\nWhy is Blackrock Filing a Bitcoin ETF Now?\n\nThe ultimate question is why now for BlackRock's filing? There have been over 30 past filings for spot Bitcoin ETFs, but this is BlackRock's first. Perhaps it could be due to the impending decision of Grayscale's lawsuit against the SEC about rejecting a spot Bitcoin ETF, or perhaps BlackRock thinks it has the right approach to surveillance to quell the SEC's concern over manipulation of the Bitcoin market. We will all stay tuned to find out.\n\nEditor's Note: This ETF will not be available for sale in the UK"

But one market expert told Forkast that this won\u2019t last long.\n\nSee related article: JPMorgan begins euro payments on its blockchain platform: Bloomberg\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin Cash rose 15% to US$222.46 in the 24 hours to 2 p.m. in Hong Kong on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap data. Another Bitcoin hard fork, Bitcoin SV, also rose nearly 50% in the past week. It is currently at US$37.23 after gaining 5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV typically trade in low volumes, said Benjamin Stani, the director of business development and sales at crypto trading platform Matrixport.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s mostly sentiment related \u2014 both are not tokens that are widely used and generally considered coins from the past cycle,\u201d said Stani, clarifying that there was no fundamental upgrade on Bitcoin forks to lead to long-term growth.\n\n\u201cThe narrative I\u2019m hearing is that Bitcoin forks obviously should get the same treatment as Bitcoin from the Securities and Exchange Commission, i.e. be considered commodities,\u201d Stani told Forkast via Telegram message.\n\nThe U.S. SEC has been aggressively policing local crypto entities on the basis that most cryptocurrencies could be seen as securities.\n\nBitcoin Cash was created in 2017 as a hard fork to Bitcoin to increase the block size on the network to allow faster and more affordable transactions. A hard fork is a permanent update to a blockchain protocol that makes the new network backward-incompatible with previous blocks.\n\nBitcoin Cash is also among the four cryptocurrencies that are offered on EDX Markets, the new compliance-focused crypto exchange backed by Wall Street giants such as Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab.\n\nLast week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have \u201cstaying power\u201d as an asset class.\n\nSee related article: How Dubai and Hong Kong are shifting crypto\u2019s power dynamics: Opinion"

Additionally, more traditional financial institutions are venturing into the U.S. digital asset industry, with asset manager Fidelity reportedly preparing for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application.\n\nAll top 10 cryptos rise\n\nBitcoin climbed 1.3% to US$30,606 over the last 24 hours to 7:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 8.51% over the past seven days.\n\nEther rose 1.63% to US$1,887 for a gain of 5.61% for the week.\n\nAll top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher, with Polygon leading the gains on a 3.26% jump and a 5.96% weekly gain.\n\nFidelity is close to filing an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., The Block news site reported on Tuesday, citing a source familiar with the matter. This follows a wave of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF applications submitted by asset managers this month, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco and Bitwise, indicating institutions are confident in the profit potential in digital assets.\n\nHowever, all the applications will need approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission and Fidelity\u2019s previous attempt to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. in 2021 was rejected. It did however launch the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF in Toronto, Canada, in December 2021. The ETF has risen 75% since the beginning of this year.\n\nInvestors are also reacting to reports HSBC, one of the world\u2019s top 10 banks, is reportedly offering Bitcoin and Ether futures ETFs on its investment platform for bank customers in Hong Kong.\n\nHSBC did not respond to requests seeking clarification on exactly when the products became available to clients as they were listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange in December. However, the development is seen as significant as the bank has traditionally been frosty toward cryptocurrencies, preventing clients from transferring funds from HSBC accounts directly to crypto exchanges.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAlthough these crypto ETFs [in Hong Kong] are based on CME futures and are not physically backed like many of the [exchange traded products] in Europe, this is certainly very positive news for investors in the region who want to get regulated exposure to price movements in Bitcoin and Ethereum,\u201d Bradley Duke, co-CEO at Europe-based ETC Group, said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap rose 1.21% to US$1.19 trillion, with trading volume dropping 8.08% to US$35.49 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nAzuki Elementals NFTs take off\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.79% to 2,876.23 in the 24 hours to 8:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 0.72% for the week.\n\nThe decline was mainly driven by the Forkast ETH NFT Composite, which fell 1.54%, said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThis may reflect traders selling their existing assets to buy the new Azuki Elementals collection,\u201d Petscher added. \u201cIt also reflects a major sell-off in the main Azuki and Beanz collections, as traders had been buying those in order to have a shot at the [Elementals] presale [on Tuesday].\u201d\n\nNFT trading volume on Ethereum jumped 307% to US$67.19 million over the past 24 hours, while volume on the Bitcoin network fell 81.61% to US$1.56 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\n\u201cAs expected, Azuki exploded and gave Ethereum its biggest day of sales volume of the year,\u201d Petscher said, adding that with wash trades removed, it should be the most sales since May 2022 when Otherdeeds NFTs were minted.\n\nNotably, CryptoSlam\u2019s top four collections by trading volume are all Azuki-related collections. The new Azuki Elemental Beans collection saw total transactions of about US$36.36 million with the new Azuki Elementals recording US$4.87 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that these big volume days may be healthy, but big mints also extract liquidity from the ecosystem,\u201d Petscher said Tuesday on Twitter. \u201cWill we see some big secondary sales that then flow back into existing projects or will this be another cycle of liquidity being extracted?\u201d\n\nAsia stocks mixed, China industrial profits sink\n\nChinese Premier Li Qiang. Image: Getty Images\n\nAsia equity markets were mixed on Wednesday morning following Wall Street\u2019s overnight rally mainly driven by rebounding home sales and strengthened consumer confidence.\n\nHowever, U.S. stock futures edged lower as of 10:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 0.04%, S&P 500 futures slipped 0.16%, and Nasdaq Futures dropped 0.36%.\n\nIn China, profits at industrial firms sank 18.8% in the first five months of this year, on the back of a slowing post-Covid economic recovery, according to official data released Wednesday.\n\nPremier Li Qiang said at the so-called Summer Davos Forum on Tuesday in China that the country was still on track to hit its annual growth target of around 5%. \u201cGDP grew by 4.5% in the first quarter year-on-year, and is expected to expand faster in the second quarter than in the first,\u201d Li said.\n\nElsewhere in the region, South Korea\u2019s consumer sentiment index climbed in June to beat expectations and reach the highest since May last year.\n\nIn Australia inflation eased more than expected in May. Its monthly consumer price indicator rose 5.6% in the 12 months to May, the smallest increase since April 2022, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data showed Wednesday\n\n\u201cWhile prices have kept rising for most goods and services, many increases were smaller than we have seen in recent months,\u201d Michelle Marquardt, head of prices statistics at the ABS, said in a Wednesday statement.\n\nWhile the economic indicators out of the U.S. this week showed the economy is holding up despite inflation and higher interest rates, investors will hear more from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell when he speaks at events in Europe. Last week he said there may be more rate increases this year in the U.S.\n\nPowell will speak at the European Central Bank Forum in Sintra, Portugal, on Wednesday and again on Thursday at the Banco de Espa\u00f1a Fourth Conference on Financial Stability in Madrid, Spain.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 76.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, and a 23.1% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged at the next meeting on July 26.\n\n(Updates to add South Korea data in equities section.)"

Source: Cointelegraph\n\nAccording to the crypto influencer, it all started over 10 years ago, when a member of his community told him about BTC and asked him to have a look at it. At first glance, Jeremie, who is also a software developer, believed that it was a scam given th the double-spending problem was \u201cconsidered to be not solvable.\u201d He explained:\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Okay, I'm gonna read the source code since I\u2019m a software developer and tell you how it\u2019s a big scam.\u2019 I read the source code, read the white paper and realized, oh no, this is not a scam.\u201d\n\nAfter determining that BTC may be the solution to a huge problem in the monetary system, he made what became a trending video, asking his community to purchase at least $1 worth of BTC. However, what happened was a bit different that what he expected. He expected his community to be grateful for the information he shared, but they did not respond the way he thought they would.\n\n\u201cOnce in a while, something comes along that makes poor people rich because they got it really, really cheap. This was one of them. I thought I was gonna be the hero to my community, but no, they thought I was crazy. They actually thought I was losing my mind,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Rising institutional interest is a \u2018bullish\u2019 sign for crypto: SEBA Bank exec\n\nWhile people may have missed out on the opportunity to buy BTC at that price, Jeremie believes it\u2019s not too late to get into crypto. According to the influencer, only 2% of the population currently holds Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). However, a problem is that people want to have an entire coin, according to Jeremie, who said:\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to have a whole Bitcoin. Nobody wants to go into a store and say, \u2018Can I get 1/100,000,000th of an apple?\u2019 They want the whole thing. So, although Bitcoin is divisible, the divisibility is part of its Achilles heel.\u201d\n\nThe developer suggested that it may be optimal to have a satoshi-based Bitcoin wallet that shows balances differently. The software developer believes showing people that \u201cfor a whole dollar, you could get a few hundred thousand Bitcoin satoshis\u201d could potentially attract more people. \u201cIt\u2019s not as appealing to have that decimal spaces than a whole Bitcoin,\u201d he added.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

Let\u2019s discuss and learn all about it.\n\nBlack Rock Bitcoin ETF: The Gateway to Mainstream Adoption\n\nThe Black Rock Bitcoin ETF has attracted significant interest within the financial realm as an exchange-traded fund that focuses exclusively on Bitcoin. By investing in this ETF, individuals can benefit from Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations without possessing the actual cryptocurrency, meaning the risk is less. This ETF effectively connects conventional finance with cryptocurrencies, appealing to institutional investors and those desiring a regulated investment option.\n\nComparing Black Rock Bitcoin ETF with direct cryptocurrency ownership has various benefits. First off, it offers simplicity and accessibility that attracts a broader spectrum of investors. Some security issues with traditional Bitcoin exchanges are reduced when trading on licensed exchanges. Additionally, the ETF structure promotes liquidity and transparency, attracting institutional investors who have previously hesitated to enter the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe significance of the Black Rock Bitcoin ETF lies in its potential to accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin among mainstream investors. Introducing a regulated investment vehicle tied to Bitcoin reduces barriers to entry and establishes a sense of trust and legitimacy in the market. This development could lead to increased institutional participation, which may contribute to the long-term stability and growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum: The Catalyst for Altcoin Season\n\nThe efficiency and adaptability of Ethereum render it a desirable investment prospect. As the foundation of countless DApps and digital initiatives, Ethereum has become a dominant force in the cryptocurrency industry. Thanks to its robust infrastructure and vibrant developer community, the Ethereum platform is constantly improving and innovating. Ethereum is likely to be an accurate store of value, and its staking functionality makes it possible to earn passive revenue.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s price movements often dominate headlines, Ethereum has the potential to act as a catalyst for altcoin surges. After a 2-day short struggle with altcoins such as Cardano and Chainlink, they have returned to their position. As the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum\u2019s price movements often influence the overall sentiment and performance of the altcoin market. Ethereum can create a domino effect, driving up the value of other altcoins. This presents investors with opportunities to capitalize on the growth potential of various altcoins.\n\nCaged Beasts: The Altcoin You Need\n\nIn the realm of altcoins, meme coins have gained considerable attention due to their unique appeal and community-driven nature. Caged Beasts is an emerging meme coin that has captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. With a focus on community engagement and utility, Caged Beasts aim to stand out in a crowded market and establish itself as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nTheir referral bonus provides an additional 20% on Tether (USDT) tokens, increasing the potential for passive income generation. And owing to a novel referral program, early investors are able to go on an exhilarating journey with these additional advantages. Caged Beasts have piqued people\u2019s interest with their attractive staking incentives and alluring memes by creating a thriving ecosystem and encouraging a sense of belonging among investors. Given its numerous positive elements, Caged Beasts have the ability to transform how meme currencies are used.\n\nBlack Rock Bitcoin ETF\u2019s emergence as a regulated investment vehicle for Bitcoin paves the way for mainstream adoption and opens doors for institutional investors. Ethereum\u2019s position as a leading blockchain platform and influence on altcoin performance highlights its significance in the crypto market. Meanwhile, Caged Beasts represent meme coins\u2019 creative and community-driven nature with utility, appealing to investors seeking unique and engaging opportunities.\n\nCaged Beasts Website: https://cagedbeasts.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CAGED_BEASTS\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CAGEDBEASTS"

        "content": "On the latest episode of Cointelegraph\u2019s Macro Markets, analyst Marcel Pechman explores how Turkey\u2019s recent interest rate increase might attract hundreds of millions of new cryptocurrency investors, and how China\u2019s looming economic crisis could affect Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto globally.\n\nTurkey\u2019s central bank has increased the interest rate by 6.5% to 15% in a dramatic attempt to fight inflation. The move comes as the local currency, the lira, dropped by 80% against the United States dollar in five years.\n\nAccording to Pechman, whether the U.S. dollar holds its dominant position as a global reserve currency doesn\u2019t matter. Turkey and Argentina\u2019s 70% inflation in 2022 are perfect examples of how decentralized cryptocurrencies might be the sole lifeguard for hundreds of millions \u2014 if not billions \u2014 of people who cannot save and transact in foreign currencies.\n\nThe next part of the show discusses whether China\u2019s economic weakness impacts Bitcoin and how its central bank digital currency could increase demand for cryptocurrencies. Goldman Sachs economists reduced their estimates for Chinese gross domestic product growth to 5.4%, citing \u201cchallenges from the property market, pervasive pessimism among consumers and private entrepreneurs, and only moderate policy easing.\u201c\n\nPechman shows how the iShares MSCI China exchange-traded fund has been a better proxy for Bitcoin\u2019s price and explains the importance of the Chinese economy to global growth. Ultimately, for Pechman, if the Chinese stock market goes down, the odds are cryptocurrency prices will be pressured as well.\n\nLastly, Pechman presents a bullish case for cryptocurrency adoption during a recession \u2014 or lower growth, in China\u2019s case \u2014 including stimulus checks being used to buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nMacro Markets runs exclusively on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel, so make sure to like and subscribe today!"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin Cash surged, making up for any losses in the past 30 days\n\nThe surge attributes to a technological upgrade, and also to the increased interest of a close cousin\n\nWhat are Bitcoin Forks?\n\nBitcoin Cash, one of the few altcoins not contested by the SEC has seen a 24% surge in the past 24 hours. The surge is the highest the cryptocurrency has seen since January, making up for any losses incurred in the past month.\n\nA Comeback Story\n\nBitcoin Cash has gained attention on both the investor side and the developer side recently.\n\nBCH received a significant upgrade in the month of May that improved its viability as a payment solution while improving its security protocols.\n\nThe token stands out due to its payment-only application, focusing on the fulfillment of smart contracts.\n\nMore importantly, BCH is at the center of a pivotal point in the history of the crypto market. A sudden rush of crypto ETFs has been taking over the news for the past 48 hours.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset management company, has officially applied for a spot Bitcoin trading ETF that enables the company to establish an exchange to address the needs of its institutional clients.\n\nOn top of that, Charles Shwab, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Citadel Security backed the launch of EDX Markets, the industry\u2019s new crypto exchange that serves both retail and institutional clients.\n\nHowever, the important thing to note here is that these exchanges are planning on trading on SEC-approved cryptocurrencies, i.e., Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum.\n\nNaturally, that increases the interest in these specific coins. With the crypto world now racing to get its hands on Bitcoin, the first obvious alternative to keep in mind is Bitcoin Cash.\n\nSoft Fork Vs Hard Fork\n\nA quick history lesson: Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, effectively creating the first-ever blockchain. Nakamoto then wrote some rules onto Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, creating what is now known as the Genisis Block, the first block on the chain.\n\nBlocks are used to store information regarding a certain asset or a certain set of protected data.\n\nAs Bitcoin gained popularity, more and more users created blocks, hence creating a blockchain. However, As blocks increased, so did the difficulty to apply new rules to the blockchain.\n\nShould a user decide to apply new rules, that don\u2019t comply with preexisting rules, to the blockchain, it creates a fork, a new blockchain. That process is referred to as a hard fork.\n\nA soft fork is when a user on the blockchain applies new rules that comply with the existing set, effectively upgrading the blockchain along with all users involved in it.\n\nBitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin, created in 2017 when Bitcoin developers couldn\u2019t agree on the process to be adopted when facing issues that compromised the structure of the blockchain.\n\nMind you, Bitcoin Cash is neither the only nor the first Bitcoin fork. There was Bitcoin XT in 2015, which doesn\u2019t even exist anymore. There are also Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited which were created in 2016.\n\nBut, seemingly, Bitcoin Cash is the last fork standing among a sea of failed forks. And, now that the SEC affirms that Bitcoin cash is among the list of cryptocurrencies it does not see as securities, the 2017 fork seemingly has a bright future of increasing in both value and demand."

        "title": "BlackRock Bitcoin ETF: How to Buy Into Crypto Exchange-Traded Fund Launched by World's Largest Asset Manager - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nObtaining SEC approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF could become a reality for BlackRock\n\nTo be part of this potential offering, one has to become BlackRock customer through iShares\n\nThe action follows the denial of many other ETF proposals, including those from WisdomTree, Grayscale, and VanEck\n\nThe largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, recently announced it plans to introduce a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in order to provide investors with proximate exposure to the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Coinbase Custody would serve as the custodian partner for BlackRock\u2019s proposed iShares Bitcoin Trust. Prior to 2022, the company introduced a spot Bitcoin private trust for institutional clients in the United States.\n\nWhat is Spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nIt is important to define the main difference between spot Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin Futures ETFs.\n\nAlthough investors can currently invest in Bitcoin futures ETFs, the United States has not yet approved a spot Bitcoin ETF. A spot Bitcoin ETF is backed by real Bitcoin (BTC), whereas a Bitcoin futures ETF is backed by derivatives on the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe number of options available to American investors would increase with the addition of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIs This the Right Time for Spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF has yet to be introduced in the United States because to opposition from the SEC. Currently, the SEC and Grayscale are engaged in a legal dispute over whether the company will be permitted to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. Later this year, a decision on that matter is anticipated.\n\nOther businesses have submitted and then withdrawn applications to start spot Bitcoin funds. There might be an overabundance of those products on the market if the SEC caves.\n\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently commented the legal fight between Grayscale and the SEC, which arose when the agency rejected the digital asset manager\u2019s proposal to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF, may also be the reason behind BlackRock move.\n\nThe alternative view is that BlackRock is preparing for a scenario in which the SEC loses the Grayscale case and suddenly opens the door to Bitcoin ETF since they are aware of this possibility. Balchunas asserted that BlackRock has a strong track record of obtaining Bitcoin ETF approval.\n\n\u201cFun fact: BlackRock\u2019s record of getting ETFs approved by the SEC is 575-1. That\u2019s another reason this is so big. They don\u2019t play around,\u201d he stated.\n\nIf they ever start trading, ETFs often take months to launch after an initial filing. According to Aisha Hunt , principal at asset management legal firm Kelley Hunt & Charles, the proposed BlackRock fund would probably encounter strong opposition from the SEC, and the filing could be withdrawn before an ETF is ever established.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s was already famous for pumping stocks and this decision was made at a time when cryptocurrency values are still well off their all-time highs, and the sector is coming under more and more scrutiny in Washington, D.C. The action follows the denial of many other ETF proposals, including those from WisdomTree and VanEck.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nPROS CONS Spot Bitcoin ETF \u00b7 Investors can access Bitcoin directly without needing to register with a cryptocurrency exchange or establish a wallet \u00b7 Diversification of the portfolio \u00b7 Regulation for investor protection. Investors in a spot Bitcoin ETF gain by investing in a regulated instrument issued by a licensed issuer rather than an uncontrolled off-market cryptocurrency exchange \u00b7 Traditional exchanges have trading hours that are limited, as opposed to cryptocurrency exchanges, which are open 24/7 \u00b7 Fees for managing ETFs Futures Bitcoin ETF \u00b7 Due to the simplicity of setup, lack of custody fees, and other criteria for spot ETFs, they might have cheaper management fees \u00b7 Decay and divergence potential \u00b7 There is no physically-backed Bitcoin in the ETF \u00b7 Traditional exchanges have trading hours that are limited, as opposed to cryptocurrency exchanges, which are open 24/7\n\nHow to Become BlackRock ETF Customer?\n\nIn order to enable ETF trading, BlackRock created iShares . With a portfolio of more than 1,250 products, iShares is the market leader in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) worldwide. iShares ETFs, a division of BlackRock, leverage knowledge and innovation to advance the financial sector and the interests of our investors.\n\nAccording to the company , iShares ETFs can be bought and sold during normal trading hours through the one\u2019s broker or trading platform. To trade iShares ETFs, one can use any online, discount or full-service brokerage account.\n\niShares ETFs are traded in Canada on the NEO platform or the Toronto Stock platform.\n\nThey are available for trading at any time throughout regular market trading hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM), and all stock-specific trading methods, including market, limit, and stop orders, are permitted.\n\nWhy Invest With BlackRock \u2013 Why BlackRock Stands Better Chances?\n\nDue to the promise of a \u201csurveillance-sharing agreement\u201d between exchanges, Blackrock\u2019s (BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust application to the SEC this week may have a better chance than prior attempts by other fund managers.\n\nOn page 36 of the aforementioned Nasdaq 19b-4 filing (where the proposed ETF will be listed), it is indicated that Nasdaq would be involved in entering into a surveillance-sharing agreement with an operator of a spot trading platform for Bitcoin (BTC) in order to mitigate against market manipulation.\n\nSurveillance-sharing agreements permit the exchange of data regarding customer identification, clearing activities, and market trading activity, which greatly reduces the likelihood of market manipulation.\n\nAccording to Graeme Moore , Head of Tokenization, Polymesh Association, not just the company\u2019s size as the largest asset manager in the world, but also the planned surveillance-sharing agreement, known as the \u201cSpot BTC SSA,\u201d is what differentiates this application.\n\nCardano\u2019s Founder Calls BlackRock Greedy\n\nHowever, not everyone seems to approve the BlackRock\u2019s move. The creator of the Cardano blockchain, Charles Hoskinon, is among those who aren\u2019t really thrilled about it. Hoskinson lambasted those who applauded the participation of the massive asset management company in a tweet , alleging that their actions revealed dubious morals, mental health, and greed.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1669471985611538433\n\nFurthermore, Hoskinson came to the conclusion that maximalists, who have extreme beliefs in favor of a single cryptocurrency, are zealots out to destroy the entire sector.\n\nHoskinson\u2019s stance indicates his disapproval of those who demonstrate fierce allegiance to a single cryptocurrency and reject any kind of accommodation or cooperation. Maximalists frequently assume that their preferred cryptocurrency is the best option available and discount the potential advantages of other projects or institutional support."

The update cuts the amount of token rewarded to its miners, which has been the main source of revenue for those companies, in half every four years until the supply reaches its 21 million cap in about 2140.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nIn the U.S., several aspirants have submitted proposals for an ETF that would provide exposure to Bitcoin\n\nEvery application for a spot market Bitcoin ETF has been turned down so far by the SEC\n\nCameron Winklevoss, warned the \u201cwindow\u201d to buy Bitcoin before the ETF \u201cfloodgates\u201d open is \u201cclosing fast\n\nA spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded funds (ETFs) have evolved into something of a big deal for the cryptocurrency world ever since the initial application for a U.S. Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was submitted in 2013.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF tracks the value of Bitcoin as its underlying asset. The complexity of exchanges, digital wallets, and private keys, according to proponents of a Bitcoin ETF, remains a formidable barrier to entry for novices to the crypto space. These investors may obtain exposure to Bitcoin through a Bitcoin ETF without actually holding any of the cryptocurrency themselves.\n\nAround the world, Bitcoin ETFs have shown up in countries including Canada, Brazil, and Dubai where they are really considered a big deal. The ProShares Bitcoin futures ETF also debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2021.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which provides direct exposure to Bitcoin as opposed to futures contracts, has, to date, denied every application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The possibility of market manipulation among cryptocurrency traders has been mentioned by the SEC on numerous occasions as one of their worries.\n\nIt All Started With Gemini\n\nIt has taken a while for there to even start talking about a Bitcoin ETF. The SEC has been holding up the creation of a trust that operates like a Bitcoin ETF since the Winklevoss twins initially proposed it in 2013. Over the past few years, it has frequently postponed making decisions on a number of big deal Bitcoin ETFs, leading companies like VanEck to withdraw their applications out of concern that the SEC will reject them.\n\nThe SEC formally denied the Winklevoss twins\u2019 application for a Bitcoin ETF in July. The Securities and Exchange Commission indicated that, in a nutshell, it does not think that investors would be sufficiently safeguarded from fraud and manipulation in the young market.\n\nAccording to the SEC, \u201cThe Commission thus cannot, on the record before it, conclude that bitcoin markets are uniquely resistant to manipulation.\u201d in the 92-page paper outlining how the decision was made.\n\nMany Have Failed \u2013 Or Gave Up\n\nThere is a long series of unsuccessful spot Bitcoin ETF applications, and the SEC has so far, as was already mentioned, denied each and every one of them. Some of the biggest companies tried but were still rejected. Here are some of the biggest SEC rejections:\n\nGlobal X\n\nIn July 2021, Global X Digital Assets submitted an application to the SEC. The proposed Global X Bitcoin Trust would be administered by the Bank of New York Mellon and traded on the Cboe BZX platform.\n\nThe SEC rejected the spot ETF proposals from Global X and NYDIG in March 2021.\n\nKryptoin\n\nIn October 2019, Delaware-based Kryptoin submitted their initial application for a Bitcoin ETF, with the proposed Kryptoin Bitcoin ETF Trust to be listed on NYSE Arca. In April 2021, the financial services firm attempted an additional Bitcoin ETF with a new plan that called for the Trust to be listed on Cboe\u2019s BZX Exchange. The service providers that would help with the launch of its ETF were included in its updated filing, including the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, which would act as custodians for the Trust\u2019s Bitcoin holdings.\n\nAfter several push-backs, the SEC rejected Kryptoin\u2019s application at the end of 2021.\n\nFidelity/Wise Origin\n\nThere was a spike in applications for Bitcoin ETFs in March 2021, including one from Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust that seemed like a big deal. According to the application for The Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, Fidelity Service Company Inc. would act as the trustee and Fidelity Digital Assets would be the custodian of the Bitcoin used to back the ETF.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s worries about market manipulation, according to Cboe Global Markets, have been \u201csufficiently mitigated\u201d as a result of growing investor participation and institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency, which have \u201cfacilitated the maturation of the Bitcoin trading ecosystem,\u201d according to a proposal to list Fidelity\u2019s Bitcoin ETF that seemed like a big deal and was submitted in May 2021.\n\nFidelity\u2019s ETF was rejected in January 2022, but now it is striking again.\n\nGrayscale\n\nGrayscale, a manager of cryptocurrency investment funds, has made no secret of its goal to turn its GBTC Bitcoin trust into a full-fledged Bitcoin spot ETF. The trust currently oversees well over 600,000 BTC, which are worth close to $20 billion at the current exchange rate. It started the procedure by formally filing a conversion application in October 2021.\n\nThe SEC rejected Grayscale\u2019s application in June 2022, claiming that the business had not taken sufficient steps to guard against potential fraud. Immediately after, Grayscale started legal action against the regulator, calling its justification for rejection \u201cillogical.\u201d\n\nVanEck\n\nOne of the first companies to apply for a Bitcoin ETF was VanEck. The VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust, created in collaboration with SolidX, was their first attempt at a Bitcoin ETF, and it debuted back in 2018.\n\nThe VanEck Bitcoin Trust application was submitted to the SEC in December 2020, with shares of the trust scheduled to trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Although the application was withdrawn in September 2019, VanEck made a second attempt to launch a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBefore rejecting VanEck\u2019s second Bitcoin ETF filing in November 2021, the SEC continually postponed making a decision on it.\n\nA third application was submitted in the middle of 2022, and the SEC again hesitated before denying it in March 2023.\n\nDespite SEC\u2019s Crackdown on Crypto \u2013 Bitcoin Seems To Be Covered\n\nSince its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has been synonymous with cryptocurrencies, making it a constant topic of conversation. Throughout the regulatory mess the US Securities and Exchange Commission produced, Bitcoin has also managed to avoid being examined.\n\nAccording to SEC Chair Gary Gensler in an interview with CNBC, unlike other cryptocurrencies that past SEC leaders had evaluated, Bitcoin is a commodity. Gensler stated: \u201cSome, like Bitcoin, and that\u2019s the only one, Jim, I\u2019m going to say because I\u2019m not going to talk about any of these tokens [that] my predecessors and others have said [are] a commodity.\u201d\n\nThis may be a reference to a lecture by former SEC Director William Hinman, who used ether as the foundation for his defense of the securities vs. commodities debate.\n\nGary Gensler was observed at a presentation identifying a few cryptocurrencies that he deemed to be \u201cnot securities\u201d even before being appointed as the SEC Chair. In his presentation, Gensler named four cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe SEC recently announced a flurry of allegations against Coinbase and Binance, two of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, launching a legal conflict that will help shape the future of cryptocurrencies. Although there are significant differences between the two lawsuits, at their core, both Coinbase and Binance are charged with failing to register their exchanges with the SEC.\n\nBoth of these businesses have made up their minds to contest the accusations leveled against them and are getting ready for a lengthy battle.\n\nBlackRock Fever and Why It\u2019s Important?\n\nBlackRock stunned the financial community on June 15 when it filed for the iShares Bitcoin Trust, becoming the most notable filer for a spot Bitcoin ETF after the US Securities and Exchange Commission had rejected the approach for years. The timing of BlackRock\u2019s relationship with Coinbase and the unexpected filing, which followed the SEC\u2019s action against Coinbase (COIN) and Binance, is puzzling.\n\nBlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world, would lend much-needed respectability to the Bitcoin market right now. An iShares spot Bitcoin ETF would be a welcome upgrade in light of the SEC\u2019s crackdown on the high-fee, unreliable Bitcoin ETFs now on the market. If this is the case, it raises the question of whether investors need to purchase this fund when it does so. Bitcoin\u2019s future is uncertain and it is very volatile. Investors cannot rely on a fundamental value, hence this factor should take precedence over all others, including fund structure.\n\nAside from its potential as an investment, it\u2019s important to comprehend how a spot Bitcoin ETF would compare to other products offered in the US. Grantor trusts, futures-based ETFs, and equity funds with exposure to Bitcoin are the three types of funds that make up the Bitcoin ETF market at the moment. The BlackRock-proposed spot Bitcoin ETF would add a fourth bucket because it doesn\u2019t fit in the existing three.\n\nWhat Does BTC Spot ETF Mean For the Crypto Market?\n\nThe co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, Cameron Winklevoss, declared on June 21 that he thinks \u201cThe Great Accumulation\u201d of Bitcoin between institutions and retail investors has started.\n\nHe said that purchasing Bitcoin before the ETFs become public is comparable to buying stock prior to an IPO and that the \u201cfloodgates\u201d for purchasing Bitcoin are \u201cclosing fast.\u201d\n\nThe Great Accumulation of bitcoin has begun. Anyone watching the flurry of ETF filings understands the window to purchase pre-IPO bitcoin before ETFs go live and open the floodgates is closing fast. If bitcoin was the most obvious and best investment of the previous decade, this\u2026 \u2014 Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) June 21, 2023\n\nSome observers believe that the investing behemoth BlackRock\u2019s recent application for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the US Securities Exchange Commission, which was followed by those of Fidelity, Invesco, Wisdom Tree, and Valkyrie, is what caused Bitcoin\u2019s 19% price increase to $30,240 since June 16.\n\n5 Bitcoin ETF applications in 5 days!\n\n\u2013 Blackrock\n\n\u2013 Fidelity\n\n\u2013 Invesco\n\n\u2013 Wisdom Tree\n\n\u2013 Valkyrie \u2014 Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) June 21, 2023\n\nIn his own piece, MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor added his two cents, speculating that growing institutional demand may eventually force out retail investors.\n\nThe window to front-run institutional demand for #Bitcoin is closing. https://t.co/JQP6ZZSarV \u2014 Michael Saylor\u26a1\ufe0f (@saylor) June 20, 2023\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) last week. The Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) made its debut on the Chicago Board Options (CBOE) BZX Exchange on Tuesday, June 27.\n\nAccording to the BITX SEC filing, the company \u201cseeks investment results that correspond to two times (2x) the return of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index.\u201d\n\nAmid reports of potential spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and other well-known companies entering the digital currency market, the price of Bitcoin has risen above $30,000. Despite an increase of more than 80% in 2023, the price of Bitcoin is still more than 50% behind its record high reached in November 2021."

        "title": "Bitcoin needs to survive recession to show bulls 'divergent strength': Strategist - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin prices hover above $30,000 as the crpytocurrency is facing headwinds tied to the potential recession. Mike McGlone, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Macro Strategist, highlights the outlook for Bitcoin, while also commenting on how geopolitical pressures are hitting oil prices.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Meanwhile, Bitcoin hovering around that $30,000 mark after getting a boost from the potential launch of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF. But our next guest warns that this won't shield the asset from its first US recession. Mike McGlone Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Macro Strategist joins us now.\n\nMike, good morning, first off. So tell us about how-- so crypto had been going through what we call a crypto winter, which includes Bitcoin obviously. So but it's seen a bid recently. Why do you say that it is-- I mean, this seems like it's temporary, I guess?\n\nWell, Bitcoin both hope it's not temporary. The key reason it had this bid recently because the BlackRock-- the BlackRock application for ETFs. Most people think that means they will be approved in the US. But that's still an if statement. It might not happen this year.\n\nThe key thing to remember about Bitcoin is when this whole situation started with COVID, it went down when the-- with the NASDAQ. It went up with all the liquidity. It's gone back down. Now it's gone back up with the stock market.\n\nSo for it to show divergence strength away from the stock market, I think it has to probably get through this recession, which we all know is coming. If you look at the yield curve, it's a matter of time. And to see if it can show divergence strength with the stock market going down as the Fed has pointed out. They are not going to be there to cut rates, which probably is bearish for equity markets.\n\nOr does Bitcoin outperform on the way up? I look at it as, it's got to prove itself. And at 30,000, about 3,100 this weekend-- or 31,000 this week. And I think it's just a little bit too risky here, particularly if we tilt over to recession, it brings most assets, risk assets lower.\n\nStory continues\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Hey, Mike. It's Julie. It is fantastic to see you. So it sounds like you don't think it's going to hold above 30 certainly in the near or even medium term?\n\nMIKE MCGLONE: Well, I'm much more worried that of the whole tide going out because of this recession and the risk that everybody's priced in for the bullish scenario. The Fed's going to ease. The Fed is going to save us. Yet Jerome Powell says he's not going to.\n\nLook at the interest rate expectations, there's not going to-- there's still price for higher rates. So we're getting liquidity pools, meaning higher rates in England, in Canada, in most of the rest of the world. And that's just not a good environment for an expanding global economy that's maybe tilting over to recession.\n\nPeople are hoping for, yeah, even if we go for recession, the Fed will ease and save these risk assets. The key point is, Bitcoin is still very much trading like a risk asset, like the stock market. Now you look at things like gold and treasury bonds, they might be better off.\n\nSo it's got to prove it. And the best way to prove it is to get through this recession and prove it. Otherwise, it's just a faster version of the stock market, which I think most people are looking for this fastest-- faster horse in the race to transition to trade more like maybe gold and long bonds.\n\nAnd basically, you have to be bullish to stock market here and expect Bitcoin outperform. Otherwise, to me the key risk is the tide goes out and Bitcoin is the fastest horse in the race and it kind of leads the way.\n\n- Mike, so we also know there's been a crypto crackdown, if you will, when you think about Coinbase, Binance. What do you make of the regulatory climate for crypto? It seems to be simmering recently. But it could just be a back burner thing right now.\n\nMIKE MCGLONE: It's going to last for a while, but this is a revolutionary technology. And oftentimes, that's what humans do when something comes in that they don't understand. Which is OK.\n\nThe key thing about the crackdown I think is prudent is we have to purge some of the massive speculation in space. All revolutionary technologies have massive speculation.\n\nI was reading this weekend about RCA, the radio company went from 3 to 300 and then back down. These things happen. But there's 25,000 cryptos in each purge. And then there's Bitcoin, and Ethereum, and crypto dollars. That's very significant revolution in technology.\n\nThe key thing is Bitcoin is going so far, so fast and it still just has a-- it's got to prove it's not just going to go up more than the stock market. And that's the key thing that most of our viewers and listeners have not lived through a true stock bear market where it drops 20%, the Fed doesn't save you, and then it drops another 20%. To me, that's the risk in the broad market.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Mike, I want to turn to more traditional commodities now, especially in the back of the news out of Russia over the weekend where the coup seems to have been averted. We are seeing a little bit of a lift to oil price but not that much.\n\nBut maybe this is a reminder for us, right, that the situation still happening. The markets have sort of adjusted to this as the status quo. But that can change, right?\n\nMIKE MCGLONE: Well, it is great to see you, Julie. I glanced down to see you on the screen a little bit. I haven't seen in a while since working with you at Bloomberg.\n\nBut crude oil commodities are a bear market. They're down. They were down almost 30% for a little while from the pink. Down 20% now on a year over year basis.\n\nAnd the key question you have to ask yourself is what's going to stop this and save it. Typically, it takes a long and variable lag at the Federal Reserve easing. What are they doing? They're still tightening.\n\nNow you see what's happening in China. China's leader made a major mistake of his unlimited friendship with Mr. Putin. And what's that doing overall, to me, it's tilting the whole world towards recession. China is having a problem and all the data is disappointing. That's the body in motion. You have to ask yourself what stops it?\n\nSo I see crude oil is more likely to head towards 50, maybe even 40 priced on what has already happened. Natural gas has already done that. Natural gas went from 10 to 2 and now it's bouncing.\n\nAnd I see the whole commodity market in a bear market. And the question is, I don't see anything stopping it. So I think the best commodity might be continue to perform well in the next year or so is probably gold as we tilt towards recession.\n\nAnd maybe we eventually get a Federal Reserve pivot or ease. But for a commodity bottom in the commodity market, typically, we are way too early. Typically, you need to see a lag to easing and we haven't even started that yet.\n\n- But, Mike, OK, so you're saying, you're seeing crude head down to 50. Right now we just put up a chart where crude is sitting near $70 a barrel. You know, I mean that seems-- I just-- that seems like such a sharp drop from where we are now.\n\nAnd the talk of a recession is starting to kind of be pushed back from a lot of analysts and economists that we speak to. What's the-- what's the base case for crude heading to $50 a barrel?\n\nMIKE MCGLONE: So I like to ask, what part of an inverted curve, plunging commodities, and the Federal Reserve over most central banks still tightening leads to the recession being over?\n\nRight now, we're seeing a bounce. But I did make the call for $50 a barrel a long time ago when it was much higher and it was on the way up. That is the trajectory.\n\nThe key thing is that's what it always does is commodities always go towards near the cost of production in the long term and particularly when the economics get a little dicey.\n\nAnd that's happening right now. $50 is the average cost of production in the US. And natural gas, the average cost of production is around two. That's where the markets bottom.\n\nSo right now, the key question I like to ask you, and our viewers, and everybody else is what stops this bear market in crude oil? OPEC's trying to help by cutting supply. But typically, what happens when OPEC keeps cut supply is that happens in bear markets. They're responding to what they see in the macro in a prudent way for a cartel that's trying to boost prices.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Mike, presumably, if indeed there were some sort of resolution to the conflict in Ukraine, some sort of change in leadership in Russia, you could foresee, envision a scenario where you would actually have a pretty big increase in oil supply, right? I mean, probably wouldn't happen right away. But would that be the outcome?\n\nMIKE MCGLONE: Well that, I think that's a good point. First of all, I would expect grain prices to go lower. They already have because the supply elasticity picked up. Remember, Brazil had a bumper crop last year because of prices. Crude oil would probably collapse.\n\nI think it would be very good for the global economic situation that that pressure from this war would be alleviated. To have a change in power, it depends on who comes in and how they do it.\n\nBut overall, that would be a relief and it would accelerate the commodity bear market, I think. And that's the key thing to remember is, we're in a bear market. What stops it?\n\nTypically, you need some major catalysts. And usually, it's from a demand side. And usually from a demand side, you need global economic demand pull and typically, need some help from some Fed and central banks.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Mike, great to see you. Mike McGlone, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Macro Strategist. Be well. Thanks.\n\nMIKE MCGLONE: Thank you."

        "content": "Ever since the news BlackRock would be filing for a spot bitcoin ETF in the US earlier this month it seems as though tradfi (traditional finance) has been making a land grab on digital assets.\n\nWhile BlackRock was not the first to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), its move has been viewed with extra heft with asset managers including WisdomTree, Invesco and crypto index manager Bitwise Asset Management all reapplying with previously rejected filings.\n\nOthers are expected to follow and it is clear to see why. BlackRock has been denied by the SEC just once in 576 attempts when filing to list new ETFs in the US.\n\nConversely, the SEC is 33-0 in rejecting spot bitcoin ETF filings, highlighting how any decision hangs in the balance.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Eric Balchunas gives the filing a 50% chance of succeeding.\n\n\u201cThe deluge of other issuers refiling is part of why BlackRock\u2019s [move] is so monumental and deserves the jump in odds because they know they would kick start all this, annoying the SEC, whom they are close with\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cThey filed anyway, it heightens the, \u2018what does BlackRock know?\u2019 variable in my opinion.\u201d\n\nWhether or not BlackRock succeeds in its filing the move underlines tradfi\u2019s commitment to crypto, even after a bleak \u2018crypto winter\u2019 \u2013 sparked by the collapse of terra and FTX \u2013 and as the SEC sets its sights on crypto exchanges.\n\nBitcoin has rallied 20% in the week since BlackRock filed on 15 June, surpassing the $30,000 mark for the first time since April this year, with the move tipped to renew demand from institutional investors, according to Saxo Bank.\n\nWhile this would serve US institutions initially, the more established European crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) market would also likely feel the impact of a player such as BlackRock entering the fray.\n\nDenys Peleshok, head of Asia at CPT Markets, said: \u201cThe initiative could reinforce the sentiment of increasing interest from large and institutional investors for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.\n\n\u201cA successful launch of a bitcoin ETF could open the way for more inflows from individuals and professional investors alike. The investment vehicle could lower the barrier of entry into the market and attract significant volumes of investment into bitcoin in particular.\u201d\n\nTradfi\u2019s influence on crypto was extended further earlier this week with the launch of a new exchange backed by Fidelity International, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities trading digital assets including bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and bitcoin cash.\n\nThe SEC now has a big decision to make. Should BlackRock\u2019s filing be successful, it is unlikely asset managers will look to stop at bitcoin ETFs, with other coins and multi-asset products likely to follow suit."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the dominant force in the world of cryptocurrencies, enjoying widespread adoption and popularity. Recent market developments have seen BTC reaching impressive price levels. This article explores how Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence affects other coins, specifically Caged Beasts (BEASTS) and PepeCoin (PEPE).\n\nBitcoin Hits $27,388 on Bitstamp!\n\nWith Bitcoin (BTC) hitting $27,388, the coin almost reached a new high for June. Despite the initial obstacles caused by the SEC\u2019s legal action against Binance and Coinbase, BTC shrugged it off and returned to its comfort zone just below $27,000. Even Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, the CEO of trading firm Eight, couldn\u2019t contain his excitement, saying, \u201cBack to $27K! That bounce from the 200-Week MA was awesome. Brace yourselves for the new uptrend to $38-42K on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nOther popular traders seem to agree. They\u2019re calling the BTC price correction \u201cover,\u201d and Rekt Capital, a trader, confirmed that Bitcoin tested and held the 200-week MA as solid support! Analysts believe that by 2025, BTC will be valued at a minimum of $82,711.81 and a maximum of $90,466.04.\n\nCaged Beasts: Liberation Through Innovation\n\nCaged Beasts (BEASTS) is a meme coin with a mission to liberate individuals from the constraints of traditional financial systems. As a community-driven token, BEASTS not only encourages participation but actively engages with their fan base, and gives them a say over its future developments.\n\nBEASTS has incentivized investors to get in on the token early by introducing a two-way referral program. Through personalized referral codes, participants can receive 20% of the deposit made by users who join using their code, while the referred investors also receive an additional 20% in BEASTS tokens.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s resurgence is likely to have a positive impact on Caged Beasts. As BTC\u2019s price rises, it often generates a renewed interest in the broader crypto market. This increased attention can and often does ripple down to the meme coin sector. Between BTC\u2019s bull market, meme coin season, and a list of lucrative benefits, it looks like BEASTS is primed to join the ranks of meme coin royalty alongside Dogecoin!\n\nStory continues\n\nPepeCoin: Facing Challenges Amidst Falling Prices\n\nPepeCoin (PEPE), a popular meme coin, has recently experienced significant price depreciation. With a staggering decline of over 78% from its all-time high, PepeCoin has been on a downward trajectory, losing value consistently. The token has dropped more than 17% in the past seven days and over 54% in the last 30 days, rightly causing distress among investors!\n\nReports indicate that a majority of PepeCoin investors are currently holding their portfolios at a loss, with only a small profit percentage. Analysts express concerns about the continuous price decline, suggesting that early investors may face the risk of losing their profits entirely, while latecomers might find themselves immersed in losses. However, some analysts are optimistic that BTC\u2019s bull market might provide the much-needed impetus for PepeCoin to leap over its hurdles!\n\nBitcoin\u2019s return to bullish ways has far-reaching implications for various cryptocurrencies. The renewed interest in BTC will likely ripple through the market and can drive increased visibility and participation for Caged Beasts in addition to reviving PEPE!\n\nFollow the Links For More Information on Caged Beasts!\n\nWebsite: https://cagedbeasts.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CAGED_BEASTS\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CAGEDBEASTS"

        "title": "Will $30K be a new springboard for Bitcoin bulls? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After a failed rally above $31,000 on June 23, Bitcoin (BTC) has sustained the $30,300 resistance for the past three days. Curiously, this happened while gold reached its lowest level in three months, trading at $1,910 on June 22, down from a $2,050 peak in early May.\n\nInvestors now question how solid Bitcoin\u2019s $30,000 support is. So analyzing what caused the recent price rally is essential to understanding how traders are positioned on BTC margin and futures markets.\n\nWhy did BTC price break above $30,000?\n\nSome analysts attribute Bitcoin\u2019s recent 21.5% gains in 11 days to BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing. But other events might have fueled the cryptocurrency gains. For instance, on June 26, HSBC Bank in Hong Kong reportedly introduced its first local cryptocurrency services using three listed crypto ETFs.\n\nMoreover, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, a Bitcoin futures fund, experienced its largest weekly inflow in a year at $65 million, with its assets topping $1 billion. It was the first BTC-linked ETF in the United States and is one of the most popular among institutional investors.\n\nBut, more importantly, the U.S. crypto regulatory environment may be improving after a period marked by enforcement actions from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) aimed at exchanges supposedly operating as unregistered securities brokers.\n\nRelated: How security, education and regulation can mitigate rising crypto scams\n\nOn June 25, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman said that financial institutions had been left in a \u201csupervisory void\u201d in terms of emerging technologies, including digital assets. Bowman added that policymakers have been relying on \u201cgeneral but non-binding statements,\u201c leaving substantial uncertainty and imposing new business requirements after significant investments have been made.\n\nIn that sense, a draft bill in the U.S. House of Representatives aims to prohibit the SEC from denying digital asset trading platforms registration as a regulated alternative trading system. Published on June 2, the proposed legislation would allow such firms to offer \u201cdigital commodities and payment stablecoins.\u201c\n\nBitcoin margin, futures suggest bullishness\n\nNow let\u2019s look at Bitcoin derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned amid improved regulatory perspectives and a sizable institutional inflow.\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because they allow investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nOKX, for instance, provides a margin-lending indicator based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. Traders can increase their exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only bet on the decline of a cryptocurrency\u2019s price.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin-lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin-lending ratio bottomed at 17 on June 20 but has improved over the past four days. The movement indicates a prevalence of margin longs as the present 24x ratio favors bullish stablecoin lending.\n\nStill, investors should analyze the Bitcoin futures long-to-short metric, which excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets.\n\nExchanges\u2019 top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nTop traders at Huobi vastly increased their longs between June 22 and June 24 as Bitcoin price broke above the $30,000 resistance.\n\nOn the other hand, OXK\u2019s top traders initially increased their shorts on June 22 and June 23, but subsequently reverted their positions by adding bullish bets.\n\nLastly, the top traders at Binance started adding longs on June 21 and have kept increasing bullish positions until June 23.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s $30,000 support showing strength\n\nOverall, Bitcoin bulls have added leverage-long positions using margin and futures markets backed by the positive momentum from multiple spot Bitcoin ETF requests, heavy institutional inflow and a more rational approach from U.S. lawmakers.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s regulation-by-enforcement approach is not backed by some U.S. Federal Reserve governors and has faced some serious backlash in the U.S. House of Representatives. For example, Representative Warren Davidson has introduced the SEC Stabilization Act, citing \u201congoing abuse of power\u201d and demanding the removal of Gary Gensler as chair of the SEC.\n\nGiven the favorable scenario toward cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin bulls should now have the upper hand to sustain the $30,000 BTC price support level in the coming weeks.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin mining company Hut 8 Mining today announced it has arranged a $50 million credit facility through Coinbase Credit, the subsidiary of America\u2019s largest crypto exchange.\n\nThe Canadian company said it\u2019ll use proceeds from the loan \u201cfor general corporate purposes.\u201d\n\n\"This credit facility gives us additional financial flexibility,\" Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton said in a statement. \"At the same time, it ensures that we can maintain our dynamic Bitcoin treasury management strategy going into the halving.\"\n\nAs of May 2023, Hut 8\u2019s holdings stood at 9,233 BTC, worth roughly $280 million at current prices.\n\nSharing details of the agreement, Hut 8 said the facility provides a $15 million term loan that is expected to be funded either at or shortly after the closing of the agreement.\n\nFurthermore, the loan agreement includes an option for an additional $20 million delayed-draw term loan tranche, which can be accessed through a second borrowing between one and two months after the closing.\n\nFinally, there is an option for a third $15 million delayed-draw term loan tranche, provided within 15 business days following the completion of the previously announced merger between Hut 8 and U.S. Data Mining Group, better known was U.S. Bitcoin Corp.\n\n\"We have one of the largest self-mined Bitcoin stacks of any publicly traded company, and this credit facility allows us to maintain our HODL strategy while giving us financial flexibility,\" a spokesperson for Hut 8 told Decrypt.\n\nA New Bitcoin Mining Giant Prepares to Enter the Fray\n\nHut 8 has established itself as a significant player in the Bitcoin mining sector, demonstrating a commitment to holding onto its BTC holdings despite the considerable financial challenges faced by the industry during the bear market of 2022.\n\nUnlike several other major Bitcoin mining firms such as Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain, which at one point last year had to sell more Bitcoin than they produced, the Toronto-based company has remained dedicated to its \"long-standing HODL strategy,\" retaining its holdings rather than liquidating them.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe \"HODL strategy\" refers to the practice of holding onto cryptocurrencies for the long term, often driven by the belief in the potential appreciation of their value over time. In case of Bitcoin, as many proponents of the world's largest cryptocurrency argue, this strategy could also be profitable considering the halving events that happen approximately every four years.\n\nBitcoin halving is a built-in mechanism designed to control the issuance of new Bitcoins and maintain scarcity of the leading cryptocurrency. Each halving results in Bitcoin miners' reward reduced by half. The purpose is to gradually reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, ultimately leading to a maximum supply of 21 million coins.\n\nIn February this year, Hut 8 and U.S. Bitcoin Corp, a Florida-based Bitcoin mining company, announced \u201ca merger of equals,\u201d with the to-be-established entity to be based in the U.S.\n\nWhen completed, the merger is expected to result in creation of one of the largest crypto mining entities in North America with facilities across Ontario, Nebraska, and Texas."

They offer traders exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures based on derivative contracts that trade on commodity exchanges.\n\nThe specific offerings are CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF, a representative from HSBC Hong Kong confirmed to Decrypt.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nFidelity, an asset management firm with over $4 trillion under its management, might be making big moves on Bitcoin\n\nAn even bigger firm, Blackrock, has already applied for a Bitcoin spot trading ETF\n\nStakeholders are not happy about the world\u2019s wealthiest taking over a market that was meant to be decentralized\n\nCrypto expert, Andrew Parish raised a flag concerning Fidelity, the world\u2019s third-largest asset management making moves on the Bitcoin trading market. Parish predicts that Fidelity is either going to apply for their own Bitcoin ETF and/or move to take over Grayscale \u2014 Grayscale runs 17 cryptocurrency trusts, including single and multi-asset funds.\n\nUPDATE: @DigitalAssets and @Fidelity is about to make a seismic move in crypto via both $BTC and $ETH . Sources expect Fidelity to either make a bid for @Grayscale or quickly launch their own spot #bitcoin ETF. One or both are coming, soon. **Blackrock and Fidelity will own\u2026 \u2014 Andrew (@AP_Abacus) June 18, 2023\n\nFidelity is one of two giant asset management firms potentially making moves in the Bitcoin trading space. The other company is Blackrock, the world\u2019s biggest asset management firm, with an asset portfolio of over $9 trillion.\n\nBlackrock, which owns major stakes in prominent brands like Spotify and Uber, has applied for a Bitcoin spot trading ETF. Blackrock\u2019s ETF application is yet to be approved by the regulating committee. However, only one of Blackrock\u2019s 576 ETF applications has ever been denied before. That one denied request was because the company was insufficiently transparent regarding its business goals for said ETF.\n\nUnderstandably, the crypto (namely Bitcoin) community is not excited about corporations that already controlled fiat currencies potentially taking control of the Bitcoin market. But, technology and regulations might just be paving the way for that transformation.\n\nWho Is Fidelity?\n\nFidelity was established in 1946, under the management of FMR, which is a company owned and run by the Johnson Family, one of the US\u2019s richest families. The company manages assets that are worth over $10 trillion starting December 2022.\n\nThe company\u2019s description depicts it as \u201ccrypto curious\u201d since it experimented with mining Bitcoin back in 2014. More recently, Fidelity launched a crypto-only arm, called Fidelity Digital Assets, or FDA for short. Ever since FDA received New York Trust Charter and launched its European operations in 2020.\n\nThe company Fidelity may take over, Grayscale, offers the option to investors to invest in crypto assets by buying shares in its trust. Grayscale has also been trying to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a spot Bitcoin ETF for years, but the SEC has been in the way the whole time. It got to the point where Grayscale actually sued SEC over the matter.\n\nAddendum: wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Fidelity offer staking soon. pic.twitter.com/GRyYx6u5cH \u2014 Andrew (@AP_Abacus) June 18, 2023\n\nAn Even Bigger Shark In The Water\n\nLearning that Fidelity is potentially making moves on the crypto market is alarming enough for stakeholders. But, knowing that Blackrock has already applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF spells near certainty that the Bitcoin market is about to witness a huge balance shift.\n\nLong story short, Blackrock is the world\u2019s biggest asset management firm. Needless to say, a company that owns more assets than any other organization entering the crypto space will not only influence the prices and availability of Bitcoin but also cause a power shift in the market, effectively controlling market prices.\n\nBlackrock\u2019s application noted that the company will be using Coinbase as its crypto custodian. In 2019, Coinbase acquired Xapo, an institutional-scale crypto custody tool.\n\nConsidering Coinbase is currently facing a lawsuit filed by the SEC, alleging that the crypto exchange traded in \u201cunregistered securities\u201d, some worry that the SEC might take Coinbase out of the picture, leaving Blackrock to freely takeover Xapo.\n\nBitcoin Stakeholders React Differently\n\nLogically, knowing that a major corporation might start buying Bitcoin in large sums would result in the market hiking up the price of Bitcoin. That all sounds well and good for some Bitcoin holders who look forward to their possessions gaining higher values. However, many, if not the majority of, Bitcoin holders, enthusiasts saw Bitcoin (and altcoins) as a way out of the fiat market that is strictly controlled by the richest corporation and politicians.\n\nFor that very reason, the crypto community is divided into two factions:- First are those who welcome Blackrock and Fidelity, waiting for their Bitcoins to get pricier, hence increasing their personal wealth. The other faction is made up of ones who fear for the future of crypto, seeing that Blackrock and Fidelity signal an omen of the end of a decentralized market, once again controlled by a handful of powerful individuals."

        "content": "ARK Investment Management, a pro-Bitcoin (BTC) firm founded by veteran investor Cathie Wood, is reportedly ahead in the race for a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nIn mid-June, the investment firm BlackRock filed an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF, triggering notable optimism in cryptocurrency markets.\n\nSeveral reports suggested that BlackRock could become the first issuer of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States should it receive approval, but that might not be the case, according to some executives and analysts.\n\n\u201cOther applicants will be able to amend their filings with similar agreements at little cost,\u201d ARK analyst Yassine Elmandjra reportedly said.\n\nElmandjra stressed that ARK and the European asset manager 21Shares filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot Bitcoin ETF in April. \u201cThat now is the only one ahead of BlackRock\u2019s,\u201d he added.\n\nMore industry observers, including Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, also argued that ARK and 21Shares should be ahead of anyone for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201c21Shares, ARK and Cboe [Chicago Board Options Exchange] are first in line because their next SEC decision date is Aug. 13, 2023, and we don\u2019t yet have a date for the other 19b-4 applications like the one from BlackRock,\u201d Seyffart stated.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s filing for the iShares Bitcoin Trust has triggered a wave of reactivated Bitcoin ETF filings. Companies like crypto fund manager Valkyrie, WisdomTree and Invesco re-filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs, with Bitwise also reportedly trying again for a BTC ETF.\n\n\u201cAnd our bull case for spot bitcoin ETF approval can basically be summed up in four words: \u2018What does BlackRock know?\u2018\u201d Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on Twitter. ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci took to Twitter on June 26 to express similar sentiments.\n\nMany industry observers have highlighted the timing for BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF filing, with some alleging that the firm could have insider information about the SEC\u2019s BTC ETF policies.\n\nNew t-shirt drop via @EricBalchunas\u2026\n\n\n\nI will say, seems hard to believe this is all coincidence:\n\n\n\nBlackRock files for spot btc ETF\n\n\n\n4 other issuers quickly follow suit\n\n\n\nEDX crypto exchange launches (backed by Fidelity, Schwab, etc)\n\n\n\n2X leveraged btc futures ETF allowed by SEC pic.twitter.com/5CfG7ThcLg \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) June 26, 2023\n\nDespite growing optimism over the potential arrival of a spot Bitcoin ETF to the U.S. market, many experts believe that such products are not coming in the near future.\n\nThe SEC is unlikely to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF in 2023 as it hasn\u2019t progressed much since the Winklevoss twins filed for one back in 2017, Wilshire Phoenix\u2019s partner Wade Guenther told Cointelegraph.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETF fever returns: Biggest inflow to ProShares\u2019 BITO in a year\n\n\u201cThere really hasn\u2019t been a lot of development since the first time many of these sponsors filed their initial spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d Guenther said, adding:\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that a spot Bitcoin ETF will be available to the public anytime soon because there\u2019s still a certain amount of time for review. So it could be not until next year, potentially the year after that, we could see a spot Bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nPreviously, ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci predicted that the world would not see a spot Bitcoin ETF in 2023.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin 2023 in Miami comes to grips with \u2018shitcoins on Bitcoin\u2019"

It\u2019s borderless, it\u2019s global, there\u2019s no action of one country that can change that trajectory. So I\u2019ve never been more bullish. \u2026 I feel really excited about the industry.\u201d\n\nLennon also discussed the lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, the Howey Test and whether politics are involved in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuits against crypto organizations.\n\nShe said companies have a strong incentive to stay in the U.S., but that it also makes sense for them to explore where else in the world may be more crypto friendly.\n\n\u201cIf you look at other places in the world, there are Bitcoin spot ETFs, there is clear regulation of how different coins are regulated or not,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think we\u2019re going to move in a direction where we get some clarity, but it\u2019s going to be because of all of these pending lawsuits. I think in five years, we\u2019ll have gotten some clarity from some of these lawsuits. I think there may also be congressional action.\u201d"

        "title": "Should You Back Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV as Price Doubles? Analyst's Warning - CCN.com",
        "content": "Recently, focus has been on Bitcoin (BTC) and the two hard forks that broke off from the main chain: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV). BSV and BCH prices have soared over the past week, outperforming even BTC.\n\nOn the grounds that the majority of cryptocurrencies could be viewed as securities, the U.S. SEC has been vigorously monitoring domestic crypto companies.\n\nJerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, stated last week that digital currencies like Bitcoin had \u201cstaying power\u201d as an asset class.\n\nPowell allegedly stated that stablecoins used for payments are viewed by the central bank as a kind of money during a monetary policy hearing on Capitol Hill on last week.\n\nHe also claimed that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have \u201cstaying power\u201d as an asset class. Additionally, he asserted that stablecoin regulation should be strengthened by the central bank.\n\nBCH Rises But Not for Long\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency\u2019s offshoot, Bitcoin Cash , has increased in value by almost 108% over the past week as speculators hope that American regulators will classify the Bitcoin-based altcoin in the same category as commodities.\n\nBenjamin Stani, the director of business development and sales at crypto trading platform Matrixport said he heard rumors that Bitcoin forks obviously should get the same treatment as Bitcoin from the Securities and Exchange Commission, i.e. be considered commodities.\n\nIt makes sense looking at the graph that shows BCH price being pretty bland and then, after Powell\u2019s speech, rising up.\n\nHe, however, warned that the overall rise is probably mostly sentiment related \u2014 \u201cboth are not tokens that are widely used and generally considered coins from the past cycle,\u201d said Stani , adding that there was no fundamental upgrade on Bitcoin forks to lead to long-term growth.\n\nHowever, the other reason for the current price increase in Bitcoin Cash appears to be the introduction of EDX Markets, a platform for institutional investors.\n\nFinancial behemoths Fidelity, Schwab, and Citadel Securities support EDX Markets, which is not registered with the SEC but has considerable clout thanks to its well-known backers.\n\nThe only cryptocurrencies that are listed on the platform are Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. The market has viewed this exclusive listing as a vote of confidence in Bitcoin Cash, especially in light of the SEC\u2019s increased scrutiny of other blockchain initiatives.\n\nIn order to address differences of opinion among the Bitcoin community regarding scalability and transaction capacity, the Bitcoin network underwent a fork in 2017 that produced Bitcoin Cash.\n\nThe great blockers and the minor blockers, two factions with various proposals, soon developed. The big blockers\u2019 support for larger blocks of transactions resulted in the \u201chard fork\u201d that gave birth to Bitcoin Cash in August 2017. By splitting the Bitcoin blockchain in two, Bitcoin Cash was given its own ledger.\n\nA change in how the market views Bitcoin Cash may be indicated by its inclusion on a platform built for institutional investors. Despite its contentious beginnings and several forks, Bitcoin Cash\u2019s performance over the past few months indicates it is gaining favor with professional investors.\n\nBitcoin SV Rise Boosted by China and UK\n\nAfter a second split in Bitcoin Cash in 2018, Satoshi\u2019s Vision, led by Australian computer scientist and self-declared Bitcoin creator Craig Wright, was born. BSV trades quite similarly to the original Bitcoin. That\u2019s advantageous right now since over the past few days, investors have flocked in droves to the most popular cryptocurrency.\n\nIn the last seven days BSV jumped by 54% and the force behind this boom could be the emergence of China back into the cryptocurrency space.\n\nChina recently modified its perspective on cryptocurrency. Beijing recently released a whitepaper named \u201cWeb3 Innovation and Development White Paper (2023)\u201d that emphasized the importance of Web3 technology for the advancement of the internet.\n\nThe global markets might be severely impacted if China were to entirely withdraw the cryptocurrency prohibition or soften its stance, which would increase demand and drive up prices. However, based on what has been happening, there are still a lot of rumors swirling about everything right now.\n\nA week ago, parliamentarians in the United Kingdom have approved a new law that would classify cryptocurrency as a regulated industry there.\n\nThe Financial Services and Markets Bill (FSMB), which was approved on Monday by the House of Lords, the upper chamber of Parliament, now moves on to the legislative process.\n\nThe comprehensive measure, which is over 340 pages long, was unveiled in July in an effort to make the most of Brexit-related freedoms and give authorities more control over the British financial system.\n\nAlthough a proposal to regulate stablecoins within the nation\u2019s payment regulations was included in the initial bill, revisions to treat all cryptocurrency as a regulated activity and provisions to oversee crypto advertising were introduced later as the bill moved through Parliament."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe market share of Bitcoin across all cryptocurrencies has surpassed 50%.\n\nAnalysts feel that a potential DeFi summer is unlikely, and that Bitcoin\u2019s decline below $30,000 is unimportant\n\nSEC still hasn\u2019t announced a specific date when it will decide whether to approve BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies quickly surged late on June 19, , helped by market excitement surrounding BlackRock offer for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on Bitcoin.\n\nOnce more, Bitcoin has achieved a big milestone. \u201cBitcoin dominance,\u201d a metric used to gauge its influence over the whole crypto market cap, has officially surpassed the 50% threshold.\n\nAs of Monday, June 20, according to TradingView data, Bitcoin has a slight majority of the market. This shows that of the $1.1 trillion market valuation of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin represents 50% of the total. According to information from CoinMarketCap , the market valuation of Bitcoin as of right now is over $521 billion.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Could Be Approved Imminently\n\nAccording to entrepreneur, investor and Bitcoin proponent David Bailey , After years of unsuccessful attempts by other companies, BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund could finally be approved.\n\nHeard a compelling case today that the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF could be approved imminently (days to weeks). Wouldn\u2019t that be something? A decade of failed attempts, BlackRock shows up and they can get it immediately. A testament to our corrupted financial system. Poetic really. \u2014 David Bailey\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf7 redeemGBTC.com (@DavidFBailey) June 19, 2023\n\nBlackRock\u2019s entry into the Bitcoin ETF market, according to Bailey, the CEO of BTC Inc. and a board member at the University of Alabama, may tilt the scales in favor of regulatory adoption.\n\nBailey\u2019s most recent remarks regarding the likely approval of BlackRock\u2019s BTC ETF are based on the asset management company\u2019s June 15th filing with the SEC.\n\nIf approved, the ETF would give investors a way to invest in Bitcoin without really possessing it, which may have a big impact on the price of BTC.\n\nStill, an analyst under the Twitter name Credible Crypto commented that instead of being a reason for fear, Bitcoin\u2019s decline below $30,000 is a crucial stage in the cryptocurrency\u2019s upward trend toward new annual highs.\n\n\u201cThe situation with Bitcoin right now is like a kerosene-soaked rag in the middle of a forest filled with dead trees \u2013 all it will take is a single spark of demand (could be in the form of a number of positive fundamental catalysts \u2013 the reason behind the spark doesn\u2019t matter) to set that rag on fire. And once that rag is on fire, the move-up will start. Slowly at first, then all at once \u2013 just as a forest fire starts from a single spark and soon becomes an uncontrollable blaze, obliterating anything and anyone in its way,\u201d he said.\n\nThe SEC has Not Specified a Deadline for its Decision\n\nETF approval by the SEC can be a protracted and difficult procedure. ETF plans must be evaluated by the SEC to make sure they are in the best interests of investors and that they adhere to all applicable rules and regulations.\n\nSince the SEC has raised worries about the possibility of fraud and market manipulation in the cryptocurrency market, the agency has typically taken several months to review and approve Bitcoin ETF proposals.\n\nThe SEC has already turned down many proposals for Bitcoin ETFs due to worries about market volatility, liquidity, and the possibility of fraud.\n\nThe regulator, on the other hand, may soon be more receptive to licensing a Bitcoin ETF, according to some analysts, given recent developments like the increased institutional acceptance of Bitcoin.\n\nThe fact that BlackRock, one of the biggest asset managers in the world, is supporting the new Bitcoin ETF, in light of these developments, could be a game changer, claims Bailey. According to him, authorities may find it simpler to approve the product in a matter of \u201cdays to weeks\u201d due to BlackRock\u2019s name and clout in the financial sector.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the SEC hasn\u2019t announced a specific date when it will decide whether to approve BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF or any other pending ETF proposals. A proposal may not be approved at all, or it may take several months or even years, due to the agency\u2019s often opaque approval procedure.\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) Reacted By Jumping Over 12%\n\nBlackRock\u2019s knock-on effects have boosted investor optimism and driven Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to new heights.\n\nBefore the markets closed on Friday, GBTC saw a gain of more than 12%, with share prices reaching $15.12, according to Yahoo Finance . In celebration of Juneteenth, a federal holiday marking the day word reached Texas that slaves had been freed, U.S. markets were closed on Monday.\n\nWith the help of Grayscale\u2019s flagship product, GBTC, investors can trade shares in trusts that hold pools of Bitcoin, with each share intended to reflect the current price of Bitcoin. This allows investors to obtain exposure to Bitcoin without having to purchase and hold the commodity directly.\n\nAccording to YCharts , the so-called \u201cGBTC Discount,\u201d which measures the price difference between Bitcoin and other currencies, reached a monthly low of -36.61% when the price of Bitcoin was $26,436. The net asset value (NAV) of GBTC\u2019s Bitcoin holdings is different from the price of the shares, and this is referred to as the discount.\n\nBullish Days Ahead?\n\nBut today seems to be a bullish day for investors. BlackRock\u2019s flawless track record for ETF applications (now at 575-1) has given GBTC a breath of fresh air despite what seems to be an ongoing legal struggle with the SEC.\n\nThe SEC has been unrelenting in its \u201canti-crypto\u201d attitude, suing a number of well-known business figures in recent weeks. Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, is well-known for having instructed a course on Bitcoin and blockchain technology at MIT. He has been a fierce opponent of the cryptocurrency industry."

The region\u2019s central bank and regulator specifically questioned companies like HSBC and Standard Chartered on why they were not taking any crypto exchanges as clients.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin 2023 in Miami comes to grips with \u2018shitcoins on Bitcoin\u2019"

        "content": "Bitcoin slipped 0.04% on Tuesday afternoon in Asia but remained above US$30,000. Ether also dropped, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed after a week of gains led by crypto-related exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the U.S.. Asian equities and U.S. stock futures gained while European markets traded mixed.\n\nSee related article: Singapore outlines design framework for interoperable networks in collaboration with financial firms\n\nBitcoin, Ether dip in 24 hours, but post weekly gains\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.04% to US$30,402 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, but strengthened 13.32% in the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data. Prices of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization have been on the rise since a number of traditional institutional players showed interest in introducing Bitcoin exchange-traded-fund (ETF), indicating its mainstream acceptance.\n\n\u201cRetail investors have been steadily accumulating Bitcoin over the years, and a significant portion of the supply remains untouched by long-term holders,\u201d Rajagopal Menon, Vice President of WazirX, India\u2019s largest crypto exchange by volume, told Forkast in an emailed response.\n\n\u201cWith the influx of institutional investors and the consequent surge in Bitcoin demand, the limited supply and illiquid nature of Bitcoin are poised to propel its price higher,\u201d Menon added.\n\nEther, world\u2019s second-largest crypto exchange, fell 0.97% to US$1,875 in 24 hours, but has risen 8.41% on the week.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA token was the biggest loser among top 10 cryptos, dropping 2.63% to US$0.2828, which brought its weekly gains to 9.11%. Solana was the second biggest loser in the top 10, falling 1.26% to US$16.73 in the last 24 hours, but has gained 4.76% in the past seven days.\n\nThe U.S. SEC filed lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance.US and Coinbase in the week of June 5. In doing so, it named several altcoins as financial securities, including Cardano, Solana, Polygon and BNB.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has surged to a new yearly high, leaving the altcoin market trailing, partly due to the U.S. SEC declaring them securities. This shift in liquidity dynamics, where funds seem to be flowing from altcoins to Bitcoin\u2026 indicates the potential for Bitcoin to sustain its upward trajectory, potentially at the expense of altcoins,\u201d Menon of WazirX added.\n\nBitcoin Cash, the spin-off of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, gained over 108% in the last seven days as investors hope the Bitcoin-based altcoin receives the same categorization as commodities by U.S. regulators. Bitcoin Cash rose 13.9% to US$220.68 in the 24 hours to 5.10 p.m. in Hong Kong on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has been outpacing Wall Street recently. It is attracting an increase in exposure and interest from institutional investors, which typically include pension funds, hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds,\u201d Nigel Green, chief executive of financial advisory firm deVere Group, said in an emailed statement on Monday. \u201cInvestors should \u2018follow the big money\u2019 as institutional funds flow into Bitcoin,\u201d Green added.\n\nCrypto exchange Bybit said on Monday it has received a license to operate a crypto exchange and provide custody services in Cyprus. The license from the regulatory authorities in Cyprus would allow the company to provide services including trading between crypto and fiat currency pairs, financial services related to crypto assets, and custody solutions tailored to clients in Cyprus and E.U. member states.\n\nSeychelles-based crypto exchange Bitget said on Monday it has launched a local website and a fiat gateway in Turkey, enabling local users to trade on Bitget using the Turkish Lira (TRY). Fiat Gateway serves as a bridge connecting traditional financial systems and digital assets, enabling transactions between fiat currencies like USD, EUR, or TRY, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization fell 0.09% to US$1.18 trillion, while total crypto market volume rose 11.12% to US$35.63 billion.\n\nAzuki NFT collection outsells BAYC on Ethereum\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 1.24% to 2,878.63 in 24 hours to 5.30 p.m. in Hong Kong, but has gained 0.21% over the past seven days.\n\nThe Forkast ETH NFT Composite also dropped 0.42% to 988.48, bringing its weekly losses to 1.28%.\n\nNFT sales volume on Ethereum rose 18.50% to US$18.62 million in 24 hours, while that on the Bitcoin network fell 23.06% to US$4.94 million, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nSales of Ethereum-based Azuki increased 98.3% to US$4.4 million, making it the most-sold collection in the last 24 hours, as NFT enthusiasts await the Tuesday minting of Azuki\u2019s new Elementals collection.\n\n\u201cRight now this is the talk of NFTs, and traders are looking for liquidity to have their chance at this mint, or to have enough funds to purchase on secondary,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThe narrative in the NFT space is that Azuki seems primed to give BAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club) a run for being the top NFT collection,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nBAYC ranked second by sales volume, gaining 1.88% to US$2.17 million in the last 24 hours.\n\nAsian markets, U.S. stock futures gain; European markets mixed\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAsian markets mostly rose after Chinese Premier Li Qiang said on Tuesday that the world\u2019s second largest economy would achieve its annual growth target of around 5%. He also expects China\u2019s economy to grow faster in the second quarter than in the first. His comments come after S&P Global lowered its outlook on China\u2019s economic growth on Monday.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite gained 1.23% and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.97%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index gained 1.88%, but Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 lost 0.49%.\n\nChina\u2019s latest Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), which is an indicator of the health of manufacturing and service sectors, is due for release later this week. China\u2019s GDP grew by 4.5% in the first quarter of this year, official data showed.\n\n\u201cDomestic demand [in China] is moderating. Demand for consumables, as well as real estate, is shrinking amid subdued confidence,\u201d according to a Monday report by Singapore\u2019s DBS bank.\n\n\u201cIncome growth has yet to catch up with the pre-Covid time. Weakening investment growth also points to softening demand,\u201d the report added.\n\nEuropean equities were mixed on Tuesday, after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said inflation remained too high. The European Central Bank has been increasing interest rates since last year, amounting to 400 basis points of raises so far, with market expectations of two more rate hikes later this year.\n\nThe benchmark STOXX 600 dropped 0.13% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 rose 0.02% during Tuesday afternoon trading hours in Europe.\n\nAccording to a Reuters poll of economists, the Bank of England (BoE) will raise borrowing costs further to tackle persistent inflation. Last week the central bank, in a surprise move, increased interest rates by half a percentage point to 5%, the highest since 2008.\n\n\u201cThe U.K. is poised for a modest economic upturn due to lower energy prices, government support measures, and a robust labor market. However, trade prospects may remain lackluster due to the sluggish economies of major trading partners,\u201d data and analytics company GlobalData said in its \u201cMacroeconomic Outlook Report: UK\u201d on Monday.\n\n\u201cBusinesses also face a high cost of financing which remains another area of concern. Although the inflation rate is projected to ease, it is expected to stay at an elevated level of 7% in 2023, down from 9.1% in 2022 but much higher than the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%,\u201d GlobalData said.\n\nU.S. stock futures strengthened as of 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.06%, and the S&P 500 futures gained 0.23%. The Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 0.48%.\n\nIn the U.S., indicators for this week on the state of the economy include home sales, consumer confidence reports and jobless claims.\n\nInvestors continue to assess the interest rate situation in the world\u2019s largest economy, following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s comments last week that indicated more rate hikes later this year. Current interest rates in the U.S. are between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006.\n\n\u201cGiven the risk of a U.S. economic recession in the second half of 2023, investing in bonds may across various Asian markets could enable a diversification of risks, as well as help attract capital into the Asian bond markets,\u201d Swa Wu, a Hong Kong-based investment director of fixed income at Schroders, said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe end of the U.S. rate hike cycle means the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar may come to a pause. This would present an opportunity for other currencies to strengthen and enhance the appeal of non-US dollar-denominated Asian bonds, and further attract capital to the asset class,\u201d she added.\n\n(Updates with equities section)"

        "content": "The Canadian Bitcoin (BTC) mining company, Hut 8 Mining, has secured a credit facility from a subsidiary of the United States-based cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase.\n\nHut 8 officially announced on June 26 that it entered a $50 million credit agreement with Coinbase Credit. The credit facility involved Hut 8\u2019s subsidiary, Hut 8 Holdings, as the borrower.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the loan proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The credit facility provides a $15 million term loan that is expected to be funded at or subsequently after closing.\n\nThe loan provides an option of getting an additional $20 million delayed-draw term loan tranche in a second borrowing between one and two months following closing. The facility also offers a third option of drawing an additional $15 million delayed-draw term loan tranche.\n\nThe last tranche would be the third borrowing provided within 15 business days following the completion of the previously announced merger between Hut 8 and U.S. Data Mining Group, also known as US Bitcoin, the announcement notes.\n\nAccording to Hut 8 CEO Jaime Leverton, the credit facility provides the firm with additional financial flexibility. He mentioned the importance of the credit facility in the context of the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which is set to reduce the BTC miner block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.\n\nLeverton stated:\n\n\u201cAt the same time, it ensures that we can maintain our dynamic Bitcoin treasury management strategy going into the halving.\u201c\n\nBitcoin halvings have been traditionally linked with bull runs, Hut 8's senior vice president for communications Erin Dermer noted in an email to Cointelegraph. \"So maintaining a strong Bitcoin stack could prove to be advantageous for us,\" she said, adding:\n\n\"We have one of the largest self-mined Bitcoin stacks of any publicly traded company, and this credit facility allows us to maintain our HODL strategy while giving us the financial flexibility to manage our business.\"\n\nHut 8 has emerged as a major Bitcoin miner that continued to hodl BTC despite massive financial issues faced by the BTC mining industry.

        "content": "Solity Network, a leading technology company, has unveiled its latest innovation: the Bitcoin Insights Dashboard.\n\nMunich, Germany, June 27, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Solity Network, a leading technology company, is thrilled to unveil its latest innovation: the Bitcoin Insights Dashboard. This innovative platform aims to alter the way individuals and businesses comprehend the fundamental workings of Bitcoin by giving a comprehensive view of its liquidity and exclusive monitoring of changes.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominant market position makes it an essential starting point for anybody exploring the cryptocurrency market. It\u2019s a springboard for learning everything about the fascinating nuances of the crypto domain. Bitcoin gives investors a solid foundation to explore the vast crypto environment and discover its untapped possibilities.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin is the initial gateway for numerous investors stepping into the realm of cryptocurrencies. Being the most widely recognized and adopted digital currency, Bitcoin garners a significant portion of the liquidity within the cryptocurrency space. Consequently, any alterations or developments concerning Bitcoin directly and immediately impact the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nHowever, it is often underestimated that risks exist not only within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols but also within Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) networks, especially when combined with DeFi protocols. To illustrate this point, let\u2019s consider the example of a significant price drop. Such an event can have an impact not just on DeFi protocols but also on the underlying L1 and L2 networks. Understanding the significance of L1 networks becomes crucial in this context.\n\nThe Solity Network platform offers a comprehensive and real-time Bitcoin Insights Dashboard to address this interconnectedness. This tool provides users with up-to-date data and in-depth analysis of the evolving dynamics of Bitcoin. Furthermore, by presenting a comprehensive overview of Bitcoin\u2019s liquidity, the dashboard empowers users to monitor fluctuations and correlations within the cryptocurrency market closely. This capability enhances risk assessment and facilitates informed decision-making within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a statement by Marijo Radman, the CTO and Co-Founder of Solity Network, he mentioned: \u201cFor DeFi to go mainstream the underlying dynamics of Bitcoin and its interconnectedness to the DeFi space have to be understood in depth.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBling Financial develops and publishes iOS and Android games that riff on familiar and well-trodden genres and formulas, ranging from the solitaire card game to bubble-popping puzzle games. But there\u2019s a compelling twist in the mix: You can earn small amounts of Bitcoin or Ethereum by playing.\n\nThis feature is not enabled by default when you start playing Bling games like Sweet Bitcoin, Ethereum Blast, or Bitcoin Pop. Luckily, it\u2019s easy to start earning Bling Points while you play levels and watch ads, and then those Points can be converted into BTC or ETH and then deposited into a Coinbase account, or converted into U.S. dollars and sent to a PayPal account.\n\nWant to earn a little crypto while gaming? Here\u2019s another way to do so.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow do I turn on crypto earnings?\n\nBy default, Bling\u2019s games just look and play like standard mobile games\u2014albeit ones with a lot of video ads in the mix. To earn cryptocurrency for playing, you\u2019ll need to enable the feature by signing in with an account.\n\nJust tap the \u201cGet Started\u201d button at the top of a Bling app screen and then choose whether to log in with a Google or Facebook account or Apple account if you're using iOS. Tapping the downward-pointing arrow at the bottom also unearths an option to log in with an email address instead. Once logged in, you\u2019ll earn Bling Points that can be redeemed for Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nScreenshots from Sweet Bitcoin, a Bling Financial game. Image: Decrypt\n\nRecently, Bling Financial has launched a daily bonus feature across its games to keep players coming back regularly. You'll earn bonus points while playing, with daily challenges that you can complete to upgrade your tier level, thus boosting your rewards.\n\nBut if you don't play daily, then you'll lose \"spicy peppers\" to feed your pet, and thus fall lower down the ranks and get less of a points boost. Basically, it comes down to this: Play regularly, and earn more points that can be converted into crypto.\n\nScreenshots from Bling Financial's bonus system. Image: Decrypt's GG\n\nWhich games does this work with?\n\nAs of this writing, Bling offers nine mobile games across iOS and Android that offer crypto rewards. Some are developed by Bling and others were created by other studios, but the in-game interfaces are largely identical\u2014and they all share the same Bling account so you can earn across games. Here are the games available so far, although this list may change over time:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin Blast ( iOS | Android )\n\nBitcoin Blocks ( iOS | Android )\n\nBitcoin Food Fight ( iOS | Android )\n\nBitcoin Pop ( iOS | Android )\n\nBitcoin Solitaire ( iOS | Android )\n\nBitcoin Sudoku ( iOS | Android )\n\nEthereum Blast ( iOS | Android )\n\nSweet Bitcoin ( iOS | Android )\n\nWord Breeze ( iOS | Android )\n\nHow do I cash out?\n\nYou\u2019ll need to use the Bling Financial website to cash in your earned points for cryptocurrency and deposit your winnings. Simply click the \u201cCash Out\u201d button in the upper right corner of the Bling website, and then log in with the same account you used in the Bling app.\n\nConverting Bling Points to Bitcoin. Image: Decrypt\n\nBling will show you how much you\u2019ve earned. In this example, I have nearly 60,000 Bling points, which equates to 0.00000060 BTC\u2014or about $0.04 worth of Bitcoin as of this writing.\n\nYou can then choose either Bitcoin or Ethereum, and have the earnings transferred to a Coinbase account\u2014or you can choose U.S. dollars and send that to a PayPal account. After cashing out, you\u2019ll have to wait seven days to do so again.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published on June 26, 2023 and last updated with new details on March 13, 2024."

        "content": "Bitcoin Price Prediction as Bulls Push BTC Up From Recent Bottom at $26,200 \u2013 Where is BTC Heading Next?\n\nBitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, experienced a recent dip that saw its price reach a bottom at $26,200.\n\nHowever, a surge of bullish activity has propelled BTC back up, raising questions about its future trajectory.\n\nTraders and investors eagerly await insights into where Bitcoin is headed next. Will its upward momentum continue, or is there potential for a reversal?\n\nIn this Bitcoin price prediction, we will explore various factors and trends to provide a Bitcoin price prediction and shed light on the future direction of BTC.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nIn analyzing the technical aspects of Bitcoin, we observe a persistent absence of notable price movements. Bitcoin maintains its trajectory within a well-defined range, bounded by an upper limit near the 26,800 level and a lower limit around 26,300.\n\nA closer analysis of the 4-hour timeframe reveals the presence of doji candles followed by candles with limited movement.\n\nThis pattern reflects a prevailing sense of indecision among investors, as they await a compelling fundamental trigger to catalyze a breakout.\n\nNevertheless, the current landscape sees Bitcoin confined within a narrow trading range, lacking a significant catalyst for directional movement.\n\nShould Bitcoin succeed in surmounting the resistance level at 26,600, it can potentially target the subsequent level at 27,350.\n\nNotably, this upside potential finds support in the existence of a triple tap pattern discernible in the 4-hour timeframe.\n\nIt is important to recognize the inherent challenges of surpassing triple tops; however, heightened demand for Bitcoin may serve as a propelling force behind a breakthrough.\n\nIn such a scenario, Bitcoin would encounter further resistance levels at 27,450 and 28,300.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Source: Tradingview\n\nConversely, a breach below the support level at 26,250 would pave the way for a downside movement, with potential targets at subsequent support levels of 25,900 and 25,400.\n\nConsidering leading and lagging technical indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) exhibit oscillatory behavior within the buying and selling zones.\n\nThis underscores the ongoing indecision prevailing among investors. Moreover, the four-hour candles of Bitcoin demonstrate fluctuations around the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), signifying a lack of a clear market direction.\n\nIn light of these technical observations, vigilance is advised at key levels of interest, specifically at 26,750 and 26,250, as they hold the potential to serve as breakout points. While Bitcoin remains ensconced within its current range, consolidation is expected to persist.\n\nHowever, a breakout from this range would present lucrative trading opportunities, irrespective of the direction Bitcoin ultimately follows.\n\nBuy BTC Now\n\nTop 15 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2023\n\nKeep yourself updated on the latest initial coin offering (ICO) projects and alternative cryptocurrencies by regularly exploring the handpicked collection of the top 15 most promising digital assets to monitor in 2023.\n\nThis thoughtfully curated list has been compiled by industry experts from Industry Talk and Cryptonews, guaranteeing that you have access to professional recommendations and valuable insights.\n\nStay ahead of the curve and uncover the potential of these cryptocurrencies as you navigate the constantly evolving landscape of digital assets.\n\nDisclaimer: The Industry Talk section features insights by crypto industry players and is not a part of the editorial content of Cryptonews.com.\n\nFind The Best Price to Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency"

        "content": "Meltem Demirors Explains Why the Next Bitcoin Halving \u2018Will Be Different\u2019\n\nAlmost everyone in the crypto community is going into 2020 talking about Bitcoin halving, with many predicting price rises and more market movement. But one expert says that the next halving \u2013 expected to take place in or around May next year \u2013 will be completely different from previous halvings due to increased BTC market \u201cdirectionality.\u201d\n\nMeltem Demirors. Source: a video screenshot, Youtube, Bloomberg Technology\n\nSpeaking on the Unchained Podcast, Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at digital asset management firm CoinShares, stated that there is a \u201cmuch bigger market for Bitcoin\u201d today compared to the last halving, which took place back in July 2016.\n\nWhile there \u201cwas no directionality in the crypto market\u201d in 2016, and investors could \u201conly really go fundamentally long\u201d with their BTC investments, things have now changed.\n\nDemirors claimed,\n\n\u201cThere are [now] bigger firms involved in Bitcoin. So I think that directionality in a much deeper market for Bitcoin is going to change the way people trade around the time of the halving.\u201d\n\nAnd the CoinShares executive said that there were even more favorable market conditions in store for Bitcoin \u2013 with demand rising and supply falling.\n\nShe commented that the fact that \u201cpeople want exposure to Bitcoin in their retirement accounts\u201d and there were now \u201ctens if not hundreds of places where traders can trade [crypto] derivatives\u201d would impact prices when halving effectively reduces the amount of BTC that is left to mine.\n\nDemirors remarked,\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll be interesting to see how people trade around the halving \u2013 particularly some of the high-frequency trading firms.\u201d\n\nAs reported, for the most part, expert traders and commentators believe that the market has already taken the 50% reduction in new bitcoins into account when trading. Investors know that 50% fewer bitcoins will be generated each day from May, so they\u2019ve paid a higher rate in the present than they would have if Bitcoin weren\u2019t halving.\n\nHowever, a contrary school of thought argues that the halving isn\u2019t really priced in, either not fully or not at all. Some point out that many casual traders of bitcoin aren\u2019t in fact aware of the halving, so haven\u2019t been paying a higher price for a cryptocurrency that will become harder to obtain next year. For example, looking at Google Trends data for the \u201cbitcoin halving\u201d search term, one can see that searches for the term haven\u2019t come anywhere close to being as popular as they were in July 2016, at the time of the last halving.\n\nAlso as reported, experts working in the sector predict certain developments with some degree of assurance: Bitcoin mining machines will become more advanced and powerful, energy consumption will move increasingly towards renewables, and production costs will be squeezed downwards. Yet on the other, the difficulty of predicting bitcoin\u2019s price makes it correspondingly difficult to predict just how profitable mining will be and whether miners will hoard or sell BTC in anticipation of next year\u2019s halving."

        "content": "How Many People Own & Use Bitcoin in 2022?\n\nSource: Adobe Stock\n\nBitcoin is the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, with millions of users and holders across the globe. But how many people actually own or use bitcoin? That\u2019s what we are diving into in this guide. Read on to learn more about the latest bitcoin usage statistics.\n\nBitcoin Adoption Has Been Growing Exponentially Since its Launch\n\nBitcoin was created as a digital peer-to-peer payment network, creating a cheaper and faster way for people to make cross-border payments. Additionally, due to bitcoin\u2019s unique features, including a limited supply and a disinflationary monetary policy, it also established itself as a store of value, an inflation hedge, and a popular investment asset.\n\nIn a little over a decade, Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization temporarily touched $1 trillion dollars, representing close to 1% of the total market capitalization of all publicly traded companies. It\u2019s no wonder that publicly traded companies, and financial institutions have started adding bitcoin to their balance sheets.\n\nBitcoin mainly came to be appreciated as an investment opportunity that could help diversify an investment portfolio as it has traditionally had limited correlation with assets like stocks and bonds. It also appealed as a great hedge against central bank monetary policies and global economic uncertainty.\n\nOn the back of this, Bitcoin has experienced massive growth since its inception, retaining its dominance as the most traded cryptocurrency in the world since day one.\n\nHow Many People Own Bitcoin in the United States?\n\nThere is no definitive way to determine how many bitcoin users there are due to the pseudonymous nature of the Bitcoin network.\n\nAs a result, we can only estimate how many holders and users there are based on several data points, including the number of wallets created, the number of active wallets, user numbers at leading Bitcoin companies, and third-party research that has used similar methodologies to arrive at an estimate.\n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at what the numbers say about bitcoin users in the US.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence, a research firm, estimates that there will be more than 25 million bitcoin owners by the end of 2022, a 16.7% growth over last year.\n\nConversely, a survey conducted in 2021 by the New York Digital Investment Group found that roughly 22% of the US adult population, 46 million Americans, own bitcoin. Responses were received from 1,050 participants with incomes above $50,000 and a margin error of 3.1%, which is regarded as statistically significant.\n\nThough another report from the US-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini in 2021 had a larger sample of 3,000 people but estimated only 21.2 million people own cryptocurrencies. In the same report released in 2022, it says one in five people in the US own cryptocurrencies, which implies 20% of the current US population of 332, 403,650. That is 66,480,730 people owning cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe report didn\u2019t specify the cryptocurrencies, but we can reasonably expect that at least 50% hold bitcoin, which is more than 33 million bitcoin owners. The research sample size for the Gemini Crypto 2022 report is 2,300 adults.\n\nJudging by the data points we have collated, we can say that there are probably between\n\nHow Many People in the World Use Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin on-chain data shows there are now more than one billion wallet addresses. But people can have more than one wallet address or keep their bitcoin on centralized custodial exchanges, making it tough to estimate the actual number of people that use bitcoin in the world.\n\nInterestingly, the global crypto exchange Coinbase has over 100 million verified users globally, many of which hold bitcoin.\n\nCrypto analytics company, Intotheblock, reported in May 2022 that the number of addresses holding bitcoin surpassed 40 million.\n\nHow Many People Use Bitcoin Every Day?\n\nThe Bitcoin network currently processes around 250,000 transactions per day and has around 1,000,000 daily active addresses.\n\nBitcoin reached over 330,000 daily transactions in December 2020, and 400,000 in early January 2021.\n\nHow Many People Will Use Bitcoin in the Future?\n\nCrypto.com\u2019s market size report says the number of cryptocurrency owners globally will reach one billion by the end of 2022, with bitcoin likely as the leader of the pack.\n\nThough this forecast was made during a bullish sentiment in the market, and might not happen in 2022, it\u2019s expected that the crypto market will continue to grow in the future.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to envision a future with bitcoin. While the digital currency has already successfully established itself as an investment asset for all types of investors, the growing application of bitcoin as a payment layer (primarily powered by the Lightning Network) could help the digital currency to become a globally used and accepted currency, which could see the number of bitcoin holders and users exceed one billion in the coming decade."

        "title": "Game Theory of Bitcoin Adoption by Nation-States - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Game Theory of Bitcoin Adoption by Nation-States\n\nSource: Adobe/Alexey Napalkov\n\n\u201cEven if other countries do not believe in the investment thesis or adoption of bitcoin, they will be forced to acquire some as a form of insurance.\u201d\n\nThe competition \u201cwill most likely be in the form of mining\u201d Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cCountries with the least to lose in terms of monetary sovereignty are more open towards adopting bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIs the race on? This is a question that at least some people have been asking ever since El Salvador made bitcoin (BTC) legal tender in September, and with the Swiss city of Lugano doing essentially the same thing at the beginning of March, it\u2019s arguably only a matter of time before other countries rush to embrace bitcoin.\n\nThis is pretty much the conclusion reached by a recent report from Fidelity Investments, whose analysts Chris Kuiper and Jack Neureuter wrote that countries \u2014 even those that don\u2019t really \u201cbelieve\u201d in bitcoin \u2014 will be \u201cforced\u201d to acquire some sooner or later. As Kuiper and Neureuter argue, this is because the cost of not doing so (when others are creating BTC stockpiles) could be extremely steep.\n\nAnd industry figures speaking with Cryptonews.com largely agree with this analysis, with most affirming that some kind of game theory is at play here. And while they also suggest that a race to acquire bitcoin by nation-states should push the cryptocurrency\u2019s price up massively, they remind that the divisibility of BTC won\u2019t make it too expensive for retail investors and users to acquire for themselves.\n\nGame theory = Worldwide bitcoin adoption?\n\nFidelity\u2019s analysts also cited game theory in their report, noting that history has repeatedly demonstrated that capital always flows where it\u2019s welcomed the most. Basically, any country that nurtures innovation (i.e. by acquiring or adopting bitcoin) will gain an advantage over its peers, who as a result will be compelled to follow suit, for fear of being left behind.\n\nAs they wrote, \u201cWe also think there is very high stakes game theory at play here, whereby if bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers. Therefore, even if other countries do not believe in the investment thesis or adoption of bitcoin, they will be forced to acquire some as a form of insurance.\u201d\n\nKuiper and Neureuter also contended that a small cost can be paid by nations today, basically as a hedge against a potentially much larger cost in the future.\n\n\u201cWe therefore wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see other sovereign nation-states acquire bitcoin in 2022 and perhaps even see a central bank make an acquisition,\u201d they concluded.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that officials from Lugano may have read this conclusion, with the city\u2019s officials signing a deal early in March with stablecoin issuer Tether to encourage businesses to accept bitcoin (and USDT). Speaking about the deal, Lugano Mayor Michele Foletti\u2019s remarks basically echoed those of Fidelity\u2019s analysts.\n\n\u201cLugano is investing in its future [\u2026] We strongly believe in this technology, the potential to scale the technology [\u2026] will build a better and more open, transparent and smart city,\u201d he said back then.\n\nAnd if you ask pretty much any analyst or figure working within the crypto sector, according to them, there\u2019s a very high probability that other jurisdictions will also turn to BTC and crypto in one way or another.\n\n\u201cCountries that adopt Bitcoin first will advantage their citizenry,\u201d Human Rights Foundation\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer, Alex Gladstein, said.\n\nSamson Mow also agrees with the Fidelity analysts, with the CEO of game developer Pixelmatic also citing game theory in his explanation. (This March, Mow left Bitcoin-focused firm Blockstream, where he served as the chief strategy officer, to focus on \u201cnation-state bitcoin adoption\u201d.)\n\n\u201cThe game theory around Bitcoin will drive nation-states to compete for Bitcoin acquisition and it will most likely be in the form of mining it. The second-order benefit will be that Bitcoin will lead more nation-states to seek energy independence in order to ensure their Bitcoin mining operations are unable to be disrupted by externalities,\u201d he told Cryptonews.com.\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s no shortage of people in crypto who are more or less assured that central banks and/or nation-states will have to acquire bitcoin to some extent. For Nigel Green, the CEO and founder of financial consultancy deVere Group, it\u2019s \u201calmost inevitable,\u201d with a growing number doing so in the \u201cnear term.\u201d\n\n\u201cCentral banks, particularly in countries where there are weaker national currencies, will be witnessing in real-time the benefits of owning digital, global currencies in our increasingly tech-driven, globalized world. We can expect them to be running advanced modeling about what would happen to their economies should they fail to move early,\u201d he told Cryptonews.com.\n\nGreen also suggests that recent geopolitical issues, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, will be exacerbating the urgency of this move, particularly as the case for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general is laid bare on a global scale.\n\nHowever, when looking at the process of nation-by-nation adoption, some analysts argue that it won\u2019t be the most developed nations that lead the way.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen with El Salvador, countries with the least to lose in terms of monetary sovereignty are more open towards adopting bitcoin. I believe we will see the \u201cnext Salvador\u201d in Latin America or Africa,\u201d said Trezor Brand Ambassador Josef T\u011btek.\n\nThe second country to make serious moves towards bitcoin adoption may be even more important than the first one, according to T\u011btek, as it will confirm the emerging trend and could add momentum and impetus to the resulting race.\n\nPriced out by nation-states?\n\nWhen exactly this will happen is probably anyone\u2019s guess, although the macroeconomic (and political) instability of the current period may accelerate the overall process, as some commentators suggest.\n\nAnd when it does happen, commentators are generally unanimous in the opinion that the price of bitcoin will skyrocket.\n\n\u201cIf a number of countries begin to compete for Bitcoin holdings, we will see a massive increase in Bitcoin price. Bitcoin in the [USD] 30-40k range is incredibly undervalued,\u201d said Samson Mow.\n\nNo analyst is really willing to give a precise figure, but most say that the rise would be substantial, given how limited the supply of BTC is.\n\n\u201cBitcoin price would likely rise massively, mostly because such purchases would greatly increase bitcoin\u2019s legitimacy in the eyes of everyday people. Bitcoin would graduate from an obscure crypto-anarchic money as it\u2019s still largely perceived now, to a serious monetary asset that everyone should consider,\u201d said Josef T\u011btek.\n\nAs exciting as this might seem for current holders of bitcoin, it raises the possibility that a massive rise in BTC would make the cryptocurrency extraordinarily expensive for \u2018ordinary\u2019 people to acquire. And assuming that it is adopted by nation-states and made legal tender, acquiring it would become necessary.\n\nHowever, experts remind that Bitcoin is highly divisible, meaning it can accommodate huge price rises while still be usable for small transfers.\n\n\u201cAs bitcoin\u2019s are divisible into 100,000,000 \u2018satoshis,\u2019 even when bitcoin hits USD 1 million, satoshis will only cost around USD 0.01.

        "content": "Who Owns the Most Bitcoin? A Closer Look at the Largest Holders\n\nSince launching around 13 years ago, bitcoin has been distributed far and wide to millions of wallets. These Bitcoin wallets are owned by individuals, public companies, private entities, and even governments. Among these holders, a few stand out because of their large bitcoin holdings.\n\nRead on to learn who owns the most bitcoin and how much they own.\n\nWho Owns the Most Bitcoin in the World?\n\nLarge bitcoin holders with 1,000 or more BTC are known as whales. They can be individuals, companies, institutional investors, and even countries. What follows is a list of the entities and individuals that own the most bitcoin.\n\nTop Known Individual Holders\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the individuals that hold the most bitcoin.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto (~1.1 million BTC)\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto was not only Bitcoin\u2019s founder but also the first miner to add blocks of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain. He mined approximately 22,000 blocks from January 3, 2009, until he left the project in 2011, acquiring 1.1 million BTC in exchange for his contribution. As of October 12, 2022, this amount is worth over $21 billion. Satoshi\u2019s bitcoin stash is stored across an estimated 22,000 addresses. These coins have never been used except for several test transactions.\n\nThe Winklevoss Twins (70,000 BTC)\n\nAfter settling a dispute with Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg in 2008 for $65 million, the twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss amassed a great deal of wealth in crypto assets. They reportedly own 70,000 BTC and have invested in many crypto businesses through their VC firm, Winklevoss Capital. The twins have also invested in other cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin and established the crypto exchange Gemini in 2014. They were on Forbes 2022 blockchain and crypto billionaires list.\n\nTim Draper (29,000+ BTC)\n\nVenture Capitalist Tim Draper, known for his early investments in companies such as Skype and Tesla, first purchased bitcoin in 2012. This was followed by a purchase of 29,656 BTC for $18.7 million two years later via a U.S. Marshals\u2019 auction of bitcoin confiscated from the infamous dark web marketplace, Silk Road. Draper may have bought more BTC in the years that followed.\n\nMichael Saylor (17,732 BTC)\n\nMichael Saylor is a well-known Bitcoin maximalist. You\u2019ll often find him publishing bullish Bitcoin tweets or making headlines through his company MicroStrategy, which is constantly buying bitcoin, even during crypto bear markets. On a personal note, however, Saylor reportedly owns at least 17,732 bitcoin. The American entrepreneur revealed his personal bitcoin holdings in a November 2021 interview.\n\nMany other individuals own a lot of BTC but have not publicly disclosed the amounts. For example, this data from River Financial shows six unknown individuals with more than 49,000 BTC in their possession.\n\nSource: River Financial\n\nTop Companies Holding Bitcoin\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the companies that hold the most bitcoin.\n\nPublic Companies\n\nMore than 20 public companies have added bitcoin (BTC) to their balance sheets. Below are the top four holders.\n\nMicroStrategy (130,000 BTC)\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) is a prolific bitcoin buyer. Since making its first purchase in August 2020, the company cannot help but buy more. Based on the purchase history on Buy Bitcoin Worldwide, MicroStrategy has made more than 20 bitcoin purchases, bringing its total holdings to 130,000 BTC as of September 20, 2022. The company may have inspired other public companies to add BTC to their balance sheets.\n\nIn its most recent purchase, MicroStrategy bought 301 BTC in September for $6 million despite the bear market. The average buying price per coin was $30,623. Earlier that month, the company filed to sell $500 million in stock to buy more bitcoin.\n\nGalaxy Digital Holdings (40,000 BTC)\n\nGalaxy Digital (GLXY) is a financial services and investment management firm that is also involved in Bitcoin mining. The company has 40,000 BTC in its holdings.\n\nVoyager Digital Limited (12,260 BTC)\n\nVoyager Digital (VYGVQ) may have held 12,260 BTC when it filed for bankruptcy in July 2022. Crypto exchange FTX will acquire the assets of the bankrupt crypto broker after winning a bid in late September 2022. Voyager cited the bear market and Three Arrows Capital\u2019s collapse as the reasons it was filing for bankruptcy. Three Arrows had defaulted on a loan given by one of its subsidiaries.\n\nTesla, Inc. (10,725 BTC)\n\nTesla (TSLA) bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in February 2021 (about 4,200 BTC), causing a flurry of excitement in the crypto space. The company\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk, tweeted \u201c#bitcoin,\u201d a post that resulted in a 17% surge in the digital asset\u2019s price. Tesla also revealed plans to accept bitcoin as a form of payment.\n\nNevertheless, the excitement of this news was short-lived because a few months later, Tesla suspended car purchases using BTC. It said it would resume BTC payments once Bitcoin mining with renewable energy reached 50%. Moreover, it sold 75% of its bitcoin holdings during the 2022 crypto bear market adding $936 million to its balance sheet. This move was contrary to Musk\u2019s 2021 tweet saying: \u201cTesla will not be selling any Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nOther public companies that own bitcoin are Coinbase Global, Argo Blockchain PLC, Hut 8 Mining Corp, and Bitfarms Limited, among others.\n\nPrivate Companies\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the largest known bitcoin holders among private companies.\n\nMt. Gox (141,686 BTC)\n\nMt. Gox was one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges. It was launched in 2010 and handled 70% of all global Bitcoin transactions by the time it ceased operations in early 2014. The Japanese exchange was a victim of several hacking attacks that led to the loss of users\u2019 funds. The exchange filed for bankruptcy in April 2014.\n\nA September 2022 announcement revealed that Mt. Gox clients are close to receiving a $3 billion bitcoin payout that will redistribute stolen funds. The now-defunct company reportedly holds 141,686 BTC.\n\nBlock.one (140,000 BTC)\n\nBlock.one is the company behind the cryptocurrency EOS (EOS). The company was sued by investors in 2020, alleging its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was a securities sale. It is also facing resistance from the EOS community, which believes the company is no longer working toward the network\u2019s best interest. Block.one still owns 140,000 bitcoin.\n\nThe Tezos Foundation (17,500 BTC)\n\nThe Tezos Foundation is a Swiss-based entity that supports the Tezos protocol and ecosystem. It reportedly holds approximately 17,500 BTC.\n\nCountries & Governments\n\nSome of the notable countries and governments that have reportedly accumulated bitcoin holdings include the Ukraine government (46,351 BTC), El Salvador (2,381 BTC), Finland (1,981 BTC), and Georgia\u2019s government (66 BTC).\n\nTop 3 Largest Bitcoin Wallets\n\nAt the time of writing, over 900,000 addresses held 1-1,000,000 BTC balances, according to BitInfoCharts\u2019 Bitcoin Rich list .\n\nAs you can imagine, few addresses hold extremely large amounts of the digital currency. For instance, there were only five addresses with BTC balances ranging from 100,000 -1,000,000. These addresses account for 4.32% of the bitcoin in circulation. As the bitcoin amount drops to 10,000, 1,000, 100, and 10, the number of addresses holding these balances increases, as shown in the table below.\n\nSource: BitInfoCharts\n\nBinance and Bitfinex have the largest Bitcoin wallets. One Binance cold wallet holds 252,597 BTC, while the other has 143,314 BTC. On the other hand, Bitfinex\u2019s cold wallet contains 168,010 BTC. The crypto exchanges may not necessarily own all these coins because they also hold users\u2019 Bitcoin deposits. The three wallets contain 2.9% of Bitcoin\u2019s total circulating supply. As of October 13, 2022, there were 19,177,431 BTC coins in circulation.\n\nSource: BitInfoCharts\n\nThe total number of Bitcoin wallets is around 200 million, but this doesn\u2019t exactly reflect the number of Bitcoin owners, as one person or entity could own more than one wallet.\n\nFinal Words\n\nAs a new or current Bitcoin investor, it\u2019s important to remember that the largest holders have accumulated their Bitcoin portfolios over time and may have had large amounts of capital at their disposal.\n\nThey may also have had the advantage of being early adopters, having had the opportunity to buy a lot of bitcoin for a comparatively small amount of money in the early years of Bitcoin. So if you are looking to build a large investment position in bitcoin, it\u2019s ok to take your time and remember to never invest what you cannot afford to lose.\n\n"

        "title": "Is It Time To Begin Talking Seriously About Bitcoin Tail Emissions? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "Is It Time To Begin Talking Seriously About Bitcoin Tail Emissions?\n\nSource: AdobeStock / miomio13\n\nIt\u2019s almost a truism that Bitcoin (BTC)\u2019s major selling point is its hard supply cap, limiting its total possible circulation to BTC 21 million. However, contrary to this received wisdom, there seems to be a growing chorus of people who worry that a hard cap isn\u2019t without its problems, and that Bitcoin will run into difficulties when its block rewards become too small (and later stop completely).\n\nA recent surge in discussion about this issue was incited by developer Peter Todd, who in July published a paper titled, \u201cSurprisingly, Tail Emission Is Not Inflationary.\u201d Basically, Todd noted that \u201cno proof-of-work (PoW) currency has ever operated solely on transaction fees,\u201d and that the lack of rewards may make block production unstable in the future.\n\nGiven how well respected Peter Todd is within cryptocurrency circles, many other serious commentators have taken his arguments as the launchpad for an exploration of whether Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy needs to be modified in the not-too-distant future. And there does seem to be support for the introduction of so-called tail emissions, even if this support isn\u2019t unanimous.\n\nMixed support for Bitcoin tail emissions\n\nIt\u2019s not too hard to find industry figures who\u2019d support the introduction of tail emissions, which in practice means that block rewards would continue indefinitely. In other words, Bitcoin\u2019s famed hard cap of 21 million would effectively be abolished, although it\u2019s likely that any perpetual reward would be small.\n\n\u201cI have been very vocal for two years already, about needing tail emissions at some point in time in Bitcoin. These tail emissions will only be necessary after four or five halvings, so in about 15-20 years,\u201d says Dr. Julian Hosp, the CEO and founder of Cake DeFi.\n\nHosp argues that most Bitcoin hardliners either don\u2019t understand the need for tail emissions, or are burying their heads in the sand in order to maintain the simple \u2014 and attractive \u2014 narrative of the supply cap.\n\nOf course, many people who\u2019d oppose tail emissions would insist that they do understand Bitcoin\u2019s monetary system, and that even so, they don\u2019t think tail emissions are necessary, at least not for a long time.\n\n\u201cGenerally I welcome the discussion around Bitcoin\u2019s long-term viability. But I believe the block subsidy will be sufficient for the next couple of halving eras (so well into the 2030s), after which ideas such as changing Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy may be more pressing than they are today,\u201d says Trezor Brand Ambassador Josef Tetek.\n\nFor Tetek, any attempt to change the issuance limit of BTC 21 million \u201cwill fail,\u201d largely because it\u2019s a \u201ccrucial part of Bitcoin\u2019s DNA.\u201d For others, seeking to change the cap isn\u2019t necessarily doomed to fail, but would almost certainly be a protracted and contentious process.\n\n\u201cSuch a protocol change, which would change Bitcoin\u2019s fundamental economics and can be implemented only by a hard fork, will be a long and difficult process for the bitcoin community to reach consensus on,\u201d says Nishant Sharma, the founder of BlocksBridge, a consulting and advisory firm for the bitcoin mining industry.\n\nBasically, the fundamental point is that Bitcoin and its advocates have spent so long championing the cryptocurrency based on its cap, that performing a U-turn now may involve something like a paradigm shift.\n\n\u201cI think that it will be challenging to make an effective argument for bitcoin tail emissions. Much of the adoption of bitcoin was made from an argument that the mining schedule would fall off a cliff,\u201d says developer Bryan Bishop.\n\nOther figures simply refuse to be drawn into the debate, with one Bitcoin developer (who prefers to remain unnamed) replying to Cryptonews.com by suggesting that our questions are all \u201cquite speculative,\u201dand that \u201cno one knows at this point in time\u201d as to where monetary policy may end up.\n\nTransaction fees alone\n\nAt the core of arguments that a tail emission is needed is the sub-argument that transaction fees alone won\u2019t be enough to support Bitcoin and the mining it depends on.\n\n\u201cTransaction fees may be enough, but that would mean that fees would go up dramatically over time. I would rather see a super tiny amount of inflation and low transaction fees, than fees alone having to pay for the security provided by miners,\u201d suggests Julian Hosp.\n\nCasual observers may assume that Bitcoin developers would be strictly opposed to tail emissions. However, Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop also works on his own experimental digital currency Webcash, and in the latter\u2019s case he admits that he\u2019s considering adding inflation at the end of its supply schedule.\n\nAccording to Bishop, such inflation is intended to \u201c(1) allow people to continue mining, and (2) to pay for the server expenses or other operational costs.\u201d\n\nThat said, Webcash isn\u2019t a direct analog to Bitcoin, since \u201cmining doesn\u2019t secure the network, so there\u2019s much less danger to this sort of alternative architecture,\u201d Bishop adds.\n\nOther commentators argue that transaction fees would be enough to secure Bitcoin, and that expense base layer fees would be offset by increasing adoption of layer-two networks such as Lightning.\n\n\u201cAs Bitcoin adoption spreads around the world, onchain transactions will likely become in high demand and the transaction fees will rise accordingly. That, however, doesn\u2019t mean that ordinary users will be priced out \u2014 it\u2019s more likely that most of Bitcoin\u2019s economic activity will happen on further layers such as the Lightning Network, with Bitcoin\u2019s base layer (blockchain) serving the role of ultimate settlement,\u201d says Josef Tetek.\n\nThis is also more or less the view taken by Nishant Sharma, who essentially argues that a rising BTC price will make transaction fees more viable.\n\n\u201cAs Bitcoin\u2019s usage continues to increase, the transaction fees earned by miners will likely grow inversely in relation to the decreasing block rewards. Additionally, if the market sentiment continues to drive bitcoin\u2019s price up, it would increase both the income streams for miners,\u201d he tells Cryptonews.com.\n\nSet in stone?\n\nGiven these mixed views, it\u2019s likely that the future will be determined more by practice than by predetermined decisions.\n\nThat is, if the Bitcoin network becomes relatively insecure or unstable in the future as a result of the drying up of block rewards, then more people will come around to the idea of tail emissions. If it doesn\u2019t, and if transaction fees emerge as sufficient, then the weight behind a shift in monetary policy will likely be negligible.\n\nYet for some, there\u2019s no chance of a change, and no desire right now to entertain the possibility of one.\n\n\u201cI think Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy is truly set in stone at this point and any attempt to change it will be met with an opposition stronger than 2017\u2019s blocksize war. I will definitely be among those running a full node enforcing the 21 million limit,\u201d says Josef Tetek.\n\nOn the other hand, miners carry the biggest influence in Bitcoin, and if a big enough majority supports a shift, then a shift will occur, with Bitcoin splitting (again) into two.\n\nAs Nishant Sharma concludes,\n\n\u201cWith both Bitcoin and bitcoin mining becoming increasingly institutional, the discourse around such proposed changes will change and we may see protocol changes that were unthinkable in the past.\u201d\n\n____\n\nLearn more:\n\n\u2013 Galaxy Digital\u2019s Novogratz Doubts Bitcoin Will Pass USD 30,000 Barrier Soon\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Could Fall to USD 13.6K This Year, Panel Says After Adjusting Predictions Once Again\n\n\n\n\u2013 Q2 Saw Over 59% of Bitcoin Mining on Sustainable Energy Mix \u2013 Bitcoin Mining Council\n\n\u2013 Bitcoin Miners in Q2 Sold 660% of What they Sold in Q1 \u2013 Report\n\n\n\n\u2013 5 Ways to Earn Sats in the Bitcoin Lightning Network Economy\n\n\u2013 As Bitcoin Scales With Lightning Network, What Role Does Litecoin Have to Play?\n\n\n\n\u2013 Report on Lightning Network-Powered DeFi and NFTs Dismissed Even by Bitcoin Advocates\n\n\u2013 The Words We Use In Bitcoin: Words, Language, Terminology, and Linguistic Attacks"

        "title": "How Will Bitcoin Halving Affect Its Security? - Cryptonews",
        "content": "How Will Bitcoin Halving Affect Its Security?\n\nAltcoiners say that due to Bitcoin halvings the security of the network will drop. \u201cBitcoin could run today with one-tenth of the mining power and be very very secure without any problems.\u201d\n\nSource: iStock/ranplett\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the most secure cryptocurrency with the most secure blockchain, remind the legions of Bitcoiners who argue that the cryptocurrency\u2019s increasing hashrate is enough to ensure that it never succumbs to a 51% attack.\n\nHowever, skeptics argue that Bitcoin\u2019s halving block rewards put this much-fabled security at risk. By reducing the quantity of new BTC given to those who mine the cryptocurrency, there will be less financial incentive to maintain the Bitcoin network\u2019s high hashrate, in theory making 51% attacks more feasible.\n\nNonetheless, other commentators believe that the increasing value of transaction fees will be enough to ensure Bitcoin\u2019s security. Because even with declining (or non-existent) block rewards, Bitcoin\u2019s rising value and adoption would mean that the rewards accruing from transaction fees will incentivize mining, they say.\n\nThe pessimistic view of Bitcoin security\n\nIt\u2019s already common knowledge that Bitcoin\u2019s next halving will take place this May, when the reward for being the first to confirm a block will be reduced from BTC 12.5 to 6.25. After this, the next halving will take place after another 210,000 blocks have been mined, and so on, until Bitcoin\u2019s supply cap of BTC 21 million has been reached in around 120 years.\n\nThe next three halvings will reduce the block rewards down to BTC 3.125, 1.56250000 and then 0.78125000. According to Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, CEO of AVA Labs, the developer of the AVA blockchain, such reductions will be enough to seriously weaken Bitcoin\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cAs the amount of awards given to the miners dwindles down, the security of the network will drop,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the security drops sufficiently, we may even see massive double-spend attacks targeting exchanges. This would, in turn, trigger exchanges to extend their confirmation times. At some point, the attackers might have access to so much hashpower that no reasonable number of confirmations may be sufficient to guarantee security.\u201d\n\nSirer adds, \u201cI give Bitcoin at most 3 more halvings, that is 12 years, before the rewards given to the miners drop to the point where intervention is necessary.\u201d\n\nAs reported, he argues that removing Bitcoin\u2019s supply cap would solve this.\n\nThe optimistic view of Bitcoin security\n\nOn the face of it, Sirer\u2019s argument looks plausible \u2013 block rewards are unquestionably getting lower, and after 30 halvings they will be reduced to nothing.\n\nStill, other people in the industry argue that transaction fees will be more than enough to incentivize Bitcoin mining. Kraken\u2018s director of business development, Dan Held, is one of these.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen Bitcoin\u2019s subsidy decrease dramatically through halvenings, we\u2019ve seen the block reward [new BTC and transaction fees] grow to exponentially higher levels,\u201d he tells Cryptonews.com.\n\n\u201cAnd as the block reward value grew massively, we\u2019ve seen transaction fees as a percentage of the block reward continue to grow as well, demonstrating that long term security should be fine with only transaction fees.\u201d\n\nBy both \u201cblock reward,\u201d Held is referring to newly minted BTC and transaction fees. And according to data from Coin Metrics, the amount paid daily in USD in transactions has been rising over the long term.\n\nSource: Coin Metrics\n\nAs reported, Bitcoin all-time cumulative transaction fees hit a symbolic amount of USD 1 billion recently. At the same time, Bitcoin all-time miner revenue (transaction fees plus block rewards) reached USD 15 billion.\n\nIn July 2016 (when the previous halving took place), the total value of all Bitcoin transactions for a single day of confirmations was only USD 30,700. On March 12, 2020, this figure was roughly USD 192,200. However, it\u2019s still small compared with block rewards.\n\nMiners Revenue\n\nTotal value of coinbase block rewards and transaction fees paid to miners.\n\nSource: Blockchain.com\n\nSo block rewards are still highly important to miners, but the point is that transaction fees as a percentage of total block rewards are growing, as Dan Held suggests. Moreover, if Bitcoin gains wider adoption, and if its price rises, the value of fees will increase.\n\nGeorge Agathangelou, the chief marketing officer at blockchain credential firm Block.co, agrees with Held\u2019s analysis. He believes that Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate will continue to rise even with declining block rewards.\n\n\u201cIn my view, the long-term reduction in block rewards will not undermine Bitcoin\u2019s security if the current trend in the Bitcoin hashrate continues to rise,\u201d he tells Cryptonews.com.\n\n\u201cWe do notice that significant investments in mining farms are being allocated around the world, while at the same time the hardware performance of mining rigs is also increasing. As a result, I would expect that the hashrate will continue to rise in the future and that Bitcoin\u2019s security will keep on rising despite the block rewards reduction.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonopoulos stressed on multiple occasions that even if the number of miners would drop by 50%, the miners who stick around and wait for the mining difficulty re-targeting, would be twice as profitable afterwards: \u201cThat is a pretty good incentive to stick around.\u201d\n\nAlso, according to Antonopoulos, \u201dBitcoin could run today with one-tenth of the mining power and be very very secure without any problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I know? Well, we had one-tenth of the mining power year and a half ago. It was very very secure then. So nothing really happens when the block subsidy runs out, nothing really happens when the halving happens, nothing happens if a bunch of miners turn off their equipment other than a slight delay in block issuance which then gets adjusted in less than two weeks. This is a dynamic system that is constantly adapting to change,\u201d he said at the end of 2019.\n\nBitcoin mining profitability vs. hashrate\n\nSource: bitinfocharts.com\n\nAdoption = Security\n\nThe bottom line is that, if Bitcoin continues to enjoy increasing adoption, its security will rise in parallel. If not, it may be in trouble.\n\nAs Dan Held explains, fees are \u201cdirectionally proportional to both the value of the network and usage. In other words, the block reward [newly minted BTC and fees] equilibrates towards adoption. There isn\u2019t a situation in which there is a disconnect as participants in this game are only financially incentivized (there is no altruism).\u201d\n\nGeorge Agathangelou agrees. \u201cAs long the price of bitcoin is above the average cost to mine a bitcoin, there will always be incentives to enter the market as a miner.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMining hardware break-even price"

        "content": "The Canadian Bitcoin mining firm, Hut 8, has secured a $50 million credit facility from Coinbase Credit, a subsidiary of the US-based cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase. The facility will be used for general corporate purposes and will be backed by bitcoins held by the exchange.\n\nHut 8 announced the development today (Monday), noting that the agreement involves its subsidiary, Hut 8 Holdings, as the borrower.\n\nHut 8\u2019s New Credit Facility\n\nAccording to the statement, the facility comprises a $15 million term loan expected to be funded at or after closing the deal. Moreover, the credit facility provides an option to get an additional $20 million in delayed draw term loan tranche in a second borrowing between one and two months after the deal has been closed.\n\nFurthermore, Hut 8 has the option of accessing an additional $15 million delayed draw term loan tranche in a third borrowing within 15 business days after the completion of the previously announced merger between Hut 8 and US Data Mining Group, also known as US Bitcoin.\n\nKeep Reading Broadridge Boosts Derivatives Trading with New Platform for Institutional Clients\n\nHut 8 and US Bitcoin merged in February in a deal that resulted in one of the largest North American crypto mining companies. After the merger, the new mining entity is now among the largest miners in the region in terms of hash rate, sharing the top spot with firms, such as Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain, according to a filing with the SEC.\n\nAhead of Bitcoin Halving\n\nHut 8\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Jaime Leverton, said the credit facility gives the mining firm \"additional financial flexibility.\"\n\n\"At the same time, it ensures that we can maintain our dynamic Bitcoin treasury management strategy going into the halving,\" she added. Bitcoin halving is an anticipated event that will reduce the rewards given to miners by half.\n\nBitcoin miners were most recently affected by crypto winter, which was characterized by low prices for digital assets and the collapse of major cryptocurrency companies. One of the miners, Core Scientific, filed for bankruptcy last December and recently filed a chapter 11 plan.\n\nNomura's new exec; toolkit for responsible use of AI; read today's news nuggets."

Discover SCENE\n\nHSBC Hong Kong customers can now trade Bitcoin and Ethereum futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), broadening access to digital asset derivatives in the emerging Asia crypto hub.\n\nThe ETFs, which are traded as securities, were listed on HSBC Hong Kong\u2019s so-called \u201cEasy Invest\u201d mobile app on Monday. They offer traders exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures based on derivative contracts that trade on commodity exchanges.\n\nThe specific offerings are CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF, a representative from HSBC Hong Kong confirmed to Decrypt. The news was first reported by Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSCOOP: HSBC, the largest bank in Hong Kong, today allows its customers to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs listed on the Hong Kong exchange, and is also the first bank in Hong Kong to allow it. The move will expand local users\u2019 exposure to cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong. pic.twitter.com/vH0LieSVGw \u2014 Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 26, 2023\n\nHSBC is the largest bank in Hong Kong, Wu said, and HSBC is the first lender in Hong Kong to allow its customers access to digital asset ETFs.\n\nAdding ETFs to its investment platform offers HSBC Hong Kong investors access to derivatives, without which customers might seek out access on an unregulated exchange, possibly using a VPN, Sei Labs co-founder Jeff Feng told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clear opportunity for [HSBC] to get ahead and offer this one product that is otherwise not allowed in Hong Kong,\u201d he said, adding there\u2019s a \u201cclear customer need.\u201d\n\nThe CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF and CSOP Ethereum Futures ETF are managed by CSOP Asset Management, a firm that saw the two products listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in December of last year. The two ETFs were the first in Asia to track digital asset futures, according to the firm\u2019s website.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoth ETFs invest in futures contracts that trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), making them an \u201ceasy transparent way for investors to capture the performance\u201d of Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to CSOP Asset Management.\n\nThe Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF is managed by Samsung Asset Management Hong Kong and invests in CME contracts as well, but launched in January of this year.\n\nWhile there\u2019s robust demand for spot access to crypto among retail investors in Hong Kong, Feng said that the demand for derivatives is equal, if not greater. And ETFs allow companies to offer exposure to crypto without opening themselves to regulatory risk in a nascent industry to which Hong Kong has only recently signaled openness.\n\n\u201cIf all of the centralized exchanges are getting this much regulatory scrutiny, it wouldn't be too wise to go out and try to launch another,\u201d Feng said of crypto exchanges more generally. \u201cIt's much safer to do what's already been proven. There's a clear playbook.\u201d\n\nFutures ETFs correlated to the performance of digital assets are nothing new in the United States. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not approved a spot-based Bitcoin ETF yet\u2014BlackRock wants to change that\u2014ProShares' Bitcoin futures ETF launched on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021.\n\nFeng said the \u201csimplicity and convenience\u201d of ETFs make them a much more palatable option for retail traders compared to other derivatives, such as options, where traders need to understand concepts like strike prices and gamma.\n\n\u201cWhen you have simplicity, what you eventually will get is volume,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will eventually speculate because it\u2019s just so easy.\u201d"

        "title": "What Bitcoin Price Models Flashing Green Reveal - Is Crypto Winter Turning to Spring - Cryptonews",
        "content": "What Bitcoin Price Models Flashing Green Reveal \u2013 Is Crypto Winter Turning to Spring\n\nBitcoin has been pumping since the start of 2023. The world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was last changing hands close to $21,000, up a stunning 27% so far on the month. That means Bitcoin is on course for its best monthly gain since October 2021, despite the month still having 15 days to go.\n\nIn light of the recent surge, Alternative.me\u2019s popular Bitcoin fear and greed index moved out of \u201cfear\u201d for the first time since April 2022 over the weekend, hitting 52 before dropping back to 45 on Monday.\n\nThe latest rally has attracted the usual predictable scepticism from bears on social media, many of whom have been dismissing Bitcoin\u2019s most recent recovery as a \u201cbull trap\u201d. In fairness, selling rallies was the playbook for 2022.\n\nThis Rally Could Be Different\n\nBut 2023 is going to be a vastly different year to 2022. 2022 was a year characterized by 1) big upside inflation surprises in key global markets like the US and Europe and 2) aggressive subsequent rate hikes from the likes of the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank. The recent shift in economic data, particularly in the US, suggests that 2023 is much more likely to be a year of downside inflation surprises and easing expectations for Fed tightening.\n\nAs a result, this latest Bitcoin rally feels different. One closely followed options market indicator shows that investors have become the most optimistic on Bitcoin\u2019s six-month performance outlook since the start of 2022.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 180-day call-put skew recovered into positive territory on Monday for the first time in a year, according to crypto derivatives data analytics firm Amberdata. That means bullish cash options expiring in six months now cost more than bearish put options of the same expiry.\n\n\u201cWe see the current rally in digital assets as a market reversal and NOT a bear market rally,\u201d said 3iQ\u2019s head of research Mark Connors in a recent email to clients. Connors noted that recent less hawkish commentary from Fed policymakers suggests that the sharp reduction in money supply of 2022 may be ending.\n\nThese Indicators Suggest Crypto Winter Turning to Spring\n\nOther widely followed technical indicators are also supportive of the idea that the crypto winter might finally be coming to an end. Firstly, Bitcoin has broken convincingly back to the north of its 200-Day Moving Average for the first time since December 2021.\n\nJust as April 2021\u2019s failed attempt to get back above the 200DMA ended up as a key market turning point (Bitcoin would go on to fall a further 67% in 2022), the Bitcoin bulls are hoping that January\u2019s bullish 200DMA break could signal the start of a new bull market.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, \u201csince the 200-day SMA is so widely observed by market analysts, it tends to carry significant weight on investor psychology when it is broken convincingly\u2026 It is often considered a minimum macro bull/bear threshold level\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s latest rally has also sent it back to the north of its Realized Price for the first time since early November, which according to Glassnode, was last at around $19,700. That means the average Bitcoin holder is now holding an unrealized profit and is \u201cunder a smaller degree of acute financial stress\u201d.\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, Bitcoin is back to the north of both its 200DMA and Realized Price for the first time since December 2021."

Discover SCENE\n\nRiot Platforms\u2014one of the largest Bitcoin mining companies in the world\u2014is set to boost its hashrate capacity to new heights after purchasing 33,280 mining rigs from MicroBT, a leading manufacturer of the machines needed to mine new coins.\n\nThe Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) order adds up to $162.9 million, making it a standout purchase even among a slew of similar investments from competing firms this year. The machines themselves, however, aren\u2019t scheduled for delivery until December 2023, and won\u2019t be deployed until the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\u201cRiot is excited to announce our first order of Bitcoin miners for our Corsicana Facility from MicroBT,\u201d said Jason Les, CEO of Riot, in a press release. \u201cThese new models are among the most powerful and efficient miners ever made for Bitcoin mining and are designed and produced specifically for immersion cooling systems.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCorsicana, Texas is a business-friendly community located just 50 miles southeast of downtown Dallas on Interstate 45.\n\nThe ASIC models purchased by Riot include the M56S+ and M56S++, the latter of which was released in late April. It boasts a power efficiency of 22 joules per terahash (J/TH), and a maximum hashrate of 230 terahashes per second (TH/s).\n\n\n\nA \u201chash\u201d is an attempt to answer the complex mathematical problems miners must solve to construct a new Bitcoin block. Mining machines consume energy generating as many guesses as possible to be the first to solve the problem and to mine the next block, which carries a current reward of 6.25 BTC.\n\nOne terrahash is a trillion hashes, while one exahash is one quintillion hashes. Riot\u2019s latest purchase is set to bring its hash rate capacity up by 7.6 EH/s, to a total 20.1 EH/s across the company\u2019s facilities.\n\nThe company has also secured an option to purchase an addition 66,560 M56S++ miners under the same terms, which will be valid through the end of next year. If executed, Riot\u2019s hashrate capacity would increase to 35.4 EH/s.\n\nAccording to data from ycharts, the Bitcoin network\u2019s total hashrate currently sits at 398 EH/s.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Les, next year\u2019s deployment will \u201cfurther enhance our already strong fleet efficiency in advance of the upcoming Bitcoin halving.\u201d The halving, expected in April 2024, will decrease miners\u2019 block rewards to 3.125 BTC, and is largely expected to pump Bitcoin\u2019s price in the months that follow.\n\nCleanSpark CFO Gary A. Vecchiarelli also referenced the halving when discussing his company\u2019s acquisition of two Georgia mining facilities for $9.3 million last week. On Tuesday, the NASDAQ traded Iris Energy (IREN) also confirmed plans to expand capacity, causing their stock to rise 21% on the day."

Just like Crypto Emporium, delivery fees depend on the type of watch and the location of the buyer.\n\nNonetheless, this is one of the best places to buy entry-level luxury watches. For instance, it offers nearly 50 Tag Heuer watches for under $10,000. Prices start at $1,290, which is for the Tag Heuer Formula 1 Quartz 41mm. With that said, Prestigetime also sells luxury watches for those on a much higher budget.\n\nFor instance, a Hublot Big Bang UNICO 42mm 441.JY.4909.RT Yellow Sapphire can be purchased for just over $93,000. A Hublot Big Bang UNICO 42mm 441.ox.1118.LR.0999 is retailing for $75,000, while a DeWitt Academia Quantieme Perpetual GMT Nebula costs almost $60,000. Other popular watch brands include Rolex, Omega, and Cartier.\n\nHowever, Prestigetime does not list any watches by Richard Mille or Patek Phillippe. Moreover, ultra-luxury collectors will not find any watches for over $100,000. Another drawback of Prestigetime is that its website is a bit outdated. This makes it challenging to find the perfect watch, as filters are limited.\n\n3. Breitling \u2013 Mid-Range Luxury Watches With NFT Ownership\n\nBreitling is a luxury watch brand that is renowned for timeless quality. This luxury watchmaker is popular with collectors that seek mid-range timepieces. The vast majority of watches are in the $20,000 \u2013 $60,000 range.\n\nAt the higher end, this includes Premier B21 Chronograph Tourbillon 42 Willy, which retails at $57,000. Then there\u2019s a Navitimer 1959 Edition at just under $40,000. There are also luxury watches for under $10,000. This includes a Chronomat B01 42 ($9,750) and a Premier B01 Chronograph 42 ($9,100).\n\nAnother reason to choose Breitling each watch comes with its own NFT. This makes the process of transferring ownership of the watch seamless, as it simply requires a transaction on the blockchain. The main drawback with Breitling is that it does not list other luxury watch brands.\n\n4. Timepiece Bank \u2013 Huge Selection of Rolex Watches\n\nTimepiece Bank is a traditional watch store that was launched in 2004. In addition to fiat money, the platform also supports crypto. In fact, Timepiece Bank has partnered with BitPay, so plenty of cryptocurrencies are supported. This includes some of the best meme coins, such as Dogecoin. We found that Timepiece Bank is one of the best online stores to buy a Rolex.\n\nThis is because entry-level buyers will find Rolex watches from just \u20ac6,950. This is for a Rolex Oyster Perpetual that has never been worn. But it can\u2019t be sold as new as it has previously been taken out of the box. Those with a slightly higher budget will find a range of Rolex Datejust models, which retail for \u20ac10,750.\n\nThe most expensive Rolex watch offered is a Cosmograph Daytona at \u20ac165,000. In addition to Rolex, Timepiece Bank lists dozens of other luxury watch brands. This includes everything from Bulgari and Gucci to Hublot, Richard Mille, and Patek Philippe. All luxury watches come with a minimum warranty period of two years.\n\nCustomer service is offered via email and Whatsapp. Finally, Timepiece Bank offers a 14-day refund policy on the proviso the watch hasn\u2019t been used or damaged.\n\n5. Jomashop \u2013 Multi-Product Store With Luxury Watches\n\nJomashop is another option to consider when exploring how to buy watches with Bitcoin. This option is suited for watch collectors with an unprecedented budget. This is because Jomashop sells watches that are worth several million dollars. For example, the PATEK PHILIPPE Grand Complications Hand Wind Blue Dial Men\u2019s Watch 6300G-010 retails for $7.6 million.\n\nWhile a RICHARD MILLE Tourbillon Pablo Mac Donough Black Dial Watch RM 53-01 sells for $1.2 million. One of the best watches for under $1 million is the ROLEX Rainbow Sapphire Daytona Chronograph Automatic Chronometer Diamond Black Dial Unisex Watch 116595 RBOW-0001, retailing for $775,000.\n\nLooking for something under $2,000? If so, Jomashop has a huge range of Tag Heuer watches, both new and pre-owned. Jomashop is a multi-product store, as it offers other items in addition to luxury watches. This includes sunglasses, fragrances, jewelry, and handbags. As such, Jomashop offers some of the best things to buy with Bitcoin.\n\nWhy Buy a Watch With Crypto?\n\nDiscussed below are some of the key benefits when electing to buy luxury watches with Bitcoin.\n\nSafety\n\nUsing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to buy luxury watches is extremely safe. This is because payments are made externally, on a wallet-to-wallet basis. The transaction will be posted to the blockchain, ensuring full transparency.\n\nThis safety net is in contrast to traditional payment methods. After all, it is far from safe to enter credit card details for a high-value purchase.\n\nLow Transaction Fees\n\nAnother thing to consider when exploring how to buy watches with Bitcoin is transaction fees. Irrespective of how much is being sent, crypto transaction fees are not based on the transaction size.\n\nFor instance, the same fee will be applicable when sending $100 and $1 million worth of Bitcoin. This is ideal for buying high-value watches online.\n\nCash Out Without a Bank\n\nLooking to sell some Bitcoin, but don\u2019t want to go through a bank? If so, buying a luxury watch is a great way to achieve this goal.\n\nAfter all, the transaction can be completed in a matter of minutes, and buyers can select a luxury watch to meet their goals.\n\nThe watch can then be stored long-term as an investment product. Just remember that buying a watch with Bitcoin will still be classed as a taxable event in most countries.\n\nDiversification\n\nWhile many collectors buy watches as fashion accessories, others do so for investment reasons. This is because luxury watches will often appreciate in value, similar to real estate.\n\nAs such, this offers a great way to diversify away from the crypto space and into another alternative investment market. Recent estimates suggest that luxury watches will increase by 69% every decade.\n\nBut this will ultimately depend on the specific timepiece. For instance, the same study suggests that Rolex is the most reliable watch to buy as an investment.\n\nCashback\n\nWhen discussing where to buy watches with Bitcoin, we mentioned that Crypto Emporium offers cashback on all purchases. This amounts to 4% of the purchase amount, which is huge.\n\nFor example, buying a $10,000 watch would yield $400 in cashback. The cashback is paid 30 days after buying a watch and paid in digital tokens via a crypto giveaway.\n\nIs it Safe to Use Bitcoin When Buying Watches?\n\nAs discussed above, buying watches with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is extremely safe. This is because the payment is made from a private wallet. Just like depositing funds into a crypto exchange, the wallet\u2019s private keys are never shared with the watch store.\n\nHowever, it is important to choose carefully when assessing where to buy watches with Bitcoin. After all, not all watch stores are legitimate. On the one hand, there are estimated watch stores like Crypto Emporium, which has been in business since 2018.\n\nFurthermore, Crypto Emporium is a crypto-only watch store, as it is a specialist in processing blockchain transactions. However, we also came across crypto watch stores that appear to be scams. As such, watch buyers should do some due diligence on the store before proceeding.\n\nFull Guide on How to Buy a Watch With Bitcoin\n\nReady to buy a watch with Bitcoin? Below, we offer a full step-by-step walkthrough on how to buy a watch with Crypto Emporium.\n\nStep 1: Open an Account\n\nFirst, visit the Crypto Emporium website and click on \u2018Create Account\u2019.

On Tuesday, it was up 2.2%.Fidelity did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.A spot bitcoin ETF is a publicly-traded investment vehicle that tracks the price of bitcoin and offers investors exposure to the asset class. On the other hand, futures-based bitcoin ETFs track the price of bitcoin futures contracts and have been viewed more favorably by the SEC Fidelity had previously dipped its toes in the crypto ETF space. It applied for a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021, but its proposal was rejected by the SEC, which said it did not meet the standards to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices.SEC Chair Gary Gensler's tough approach to crypto companies has earned him the \"bad cop\" reputation among industry players.The regulator is also locked in a dispute with Grayscale Investment , which sued the SEC for rejecting its application last June to convert its flagship spot Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF."

        "content": "As US Seized Gold in 1933, Is There a Threat to Bitcoin in the 2020s?\n\nIn 1933, the US banned the hoarding of gold and ordered citizens to deliver their gold to the Fed. While it\u2019s more difficult to ban crypto, just remember \u2013 not your keys, not your coins.\n\nA fragment of the Executive Order 6102. Source: Wikipedia\n\nA sharp global recession seems to be inevitable. Could the US or any other government shut down crypto exchanges or ban the ownership of cryptoasset?\n\nAt first glance, this seems like an extreme and unlikely scenario. However, figures within the crypto industry believe that it could become a real possibility if, in the US case, USD suffers severe inflation during a long recession.\n\nBy closing exchanges and custodian services, the US government would attempt to limit the number of people exchanging increasingly devalued USD for bitcoin (BTC) and other coins.\n\nHowever, while there\u2019s an outside chance that the US government might move to close exchanges and ban the ownership of crypto, it\u2019s unlikely that any such move would be effective in stopping Americans from holding and trading crypto. That is, so long as they moved their coins off any US-based third-party platforms before the government swooped in. In theory, the same scenario would play out in other countries too.\n\nExecutive Order 6102\n\nOn March 12, Messari founder Ryan Selkis tweeted a warning to his 100,000 followers:\n\nBy \u201cFDR era,\u201d Selkis is referring to former president Franklin Delano Roosevelt. On April 5, 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102, which decreed that all US citizens \u201care required to deliver [\u2026] all gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates now owned by them to a Federal Reserve Bank, branch or agency.\u201d The hoarding of gold, similar to the stacking sats, was forbidden back then in order to help the Federal Reserve to increase the money supply during the depression. Also, a penalty of USD 10,000 and/or up to five to ten years imprisonment were introduced.\n\nHowever, back then, the Federal Reserve Act still required 40% gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued, while today the US dollar is not backed by gold (or BTC for that matter).\n\nIn either case, it seems that Selkis is concerned that the Trump administration would do for cryptoasset what FDR did for gold. And it would seem that a number of other people working within the crypto industry agree with him.\n\nSpeaking to Cryptonews.com, CryptoMondays partner Lou Kerner agrees that the need to limit the impact of crypto hoarding on fiat monetary systems might impel the US government (and possibly other governments) to close down exchanges or even seize crypto.\n\n\u201cThe most popular reason used by governments is to ban the use of cryptocurrencies and the services that support their use is illicit activity,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s broadly believed that governments are most concerned about the impact it could have on their own monetary system if citizens had choice.\u201d\n\nIndeed, other governments have taken harsh restrictive measures against crypto for reasons related to capital controls. Most notoriously, the Chinese government banned crypto exchanges (not BTC) in 2017, largely due to fears over capital flight (i.e. people sending or trading money overseas).\n\nSo it\u2019s certainly not inconceivable that other governments \u2013 including the US government \u2013 could take similar steps if the coronavirus pandemic triggered recession results in a deep depression and high USD inflation. While hyperinflation is not likely in the US, some estimate that the USD may devalue in the next 12 months.\n\nCurrent exchange outflows\n\nGiven that this threat can\u2019t be dismissed, voices within the industry recommend taking crypto off third-party platforms wherever possible.\n\n\u201cNot your keys, not your coins, is a popular phrase because governments can always seize your assets, whether its on a crypto exchange, or at Chase Bank,\u201d says Lou Kerner, who agrees that traders should seek to use their own wallets with their own private keys in order to safeguard their crypto.\n\nIn fact, it would seem that some traders are already beginning to move crypto off of exchanges. As reported, BTC outflow from exchanges has been growing daily since March 18.\n\nLikewise, Coin Metrics recently said that BitMEX has experienced \u201cmass liquidations\u201d since March 13, with its holdings of BTC falling by 22%.\n\nSource: Coin Metrics\n\nIt\u2019s hard to confirm whether this exodus is happening because people fear government action. Asked whether people were preparing for possible closures or seizures, Lou Kerner suggests that the outflows may be caused by a variety of reasons.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of crosscurrents going on at the same time. Hard to know exactly what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says. \u201cWhales tend to have their own wallets. So it could be that whales are owning a larger percentage of the coins.\u201d\n\nAnd obviously, with 6.6 million people claiming for unemployment in the United States, it could be that more people are liquidating their crypto in order to put extra USD in their pockets. Marcus Swanepoel, co-founder and CEO of crypto exchange Luno, warned recently that in case of a massive global recession even the long-term hodlers may be forced to sell their BTC to survive.\n\n\u2018It largely doesn\u2019t matter\u2019\n\nBut even assuming that, in the worst-case scenario, the US government does attempt to shut down US-based exchanges and prohibit cryptocurrency ownership, will this make a massive difference? Wouldn\u2019t a ban on bitcoin and other cryptoassets be more or less unenforceable?\n\n\u201cGovernments do what they believe is in their best interests,\u201d says Lou Kerner, agreeing that a ban could be a possibility. \u201cI think the important point is that it largely doesn\u2019t matter. China has banned Google and Facebook and Twitter. But they\u2019re still things.\u201d\n\nAgain, in the case of China, the government\u2019s banning of cryptoexchanges hasn\u2019t prevented Chinese people from owning cryptocurrencies and trading them on various platforms, including over-the-counter (OTC). For example, according to a small poll conducted by PANews in October 2019, 8% out of 300 surveyed Chinese students hold some kind of cryptoasset, while 17% in total have held crypto at some point.\n\nSo even if the US government succeeded in shutting down US-based exchanges, US citizens and residents would technically still be able to trade crypto on international, decentralized, peer-to-peer platforms. And even if the government banned ownership of crypto outright, it would still be hard to trace crypto held on private wallets. Moreover, without regulated crypto exchanges that know who their customers are it would be even harder to track crypto owners. (Let\u2019s hope the government won\u2019t get access to a user database on your exchange.)\n\nTo conclude, while it seems that the general consensus is that crypto bans are not 100% effective, it doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t hurt. Just stay vigilant and remember \u2013 not your keys, not your coins.\n\n___\n\nLearn more: Hey, Gov\u2019t Officials! Do You Still Think You Can Ban Bitcoin?"

        "content": "This Bitcoin Chinese New Year Trade Has Been A winner for Last 8 Years\n\nImage Source: Pixabay\n\nBitcoin has extended gains over the weekend ahead of celebrations for the Lunar New Year holiday and the Spring Festival throughout Southeast Asia, rallying to its highest level since August.\n\nThe flagship cryptocurrency surged to over $23,000 on Saturday, gaining as much as 10% at one point compared to the earlier day, data by CoinMarketCap shows. The coin has reached a local high of around $23,282, a level not seen in more than five months. As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $22,900, almost flat over the past day.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, also registered significant gains, reaching a local high of around $1,674, a level not seen since September last year when its much-anticipated Merge upgrade went through. The total market cap has passed the $1 trillion mark.\n\nThe rally comes as Bitcoin has historically performed well at the start of the Lunar New Year holiday celebrated across much of Asia, often referred to as Chinese New Year. According to Markus Thielen, head of research at Matrixport, the Lunar New Year holiday is considered a good entry time for investors. He said:\n\n\u201cBuying Bitcoin at the end of the first day of Chinese New Year and selling it 10 trading days later would have returned +9%, on average, with all of the last eight years (2015-2022) showing positive returns. The beginning of the Chinese New Year has been an attractive entry timing for long positions.\u201d\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are up around 38% and 35% year-to-date. While a mix of factors might have impacted crypto\u2019s impressive start this year, the market managed to gather momentum after new data released by the U.S. Department of Labor last week indicated a cooldown in inflation.\n\nThe annual inflation rate fell to 6.5% in December, compared to 7.1% in November. Lower inflation is usually viewed as bullish for risk assets like crypto as it puts pressure on the US Federal Reserve to slow down interest rate increases.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto bulls expect the crypto market to continue its upward movement, Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, anticipates Bitcoin to reach between $35,000 to $44,000 this year, and Ethereum between $2,400 to $3,200. However, he has still warned investors to be wary of near-term risks. He said:"
