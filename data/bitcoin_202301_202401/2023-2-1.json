        "title": "There\u2019s a wild theory that the price of Bitcoin is being propped up\u2014and the academic who proved manipulation in 2017 suspects it may be happening again - Fortune",
        "content": "Back in 2017, John Griffin, a professor of finance at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, noticed something strange. Griffin follows a totally different beat from typical business school finance profs who explore, say, how business cycles influence commodity prices or Fed policy sways the term structure of interest rates. The 6-foot-2 former high school football star views himself as a crusader for good, a moral sleuth who, as he tells Fortune, \u201clooks to expose financial evil, to shed light on the world and expose dark things in the markets.\u201d After the Great Financial Crisis, Griffin became a devout Christian. He has since dedicated his distinguished career to righteous forensic digging that\u2019s unearthed abuses ranging from insider trading to mortgage fraud to the doctoring of bond ratings during the financial crisis.\n\nAs Griffin and Amin Shams, then a doctoral candidate at McCombs who\u2019s joined Griffin in several gumshoe investigations, screened for misdeeds in 2017, they were fascinated to see that a little-known token that\u2019s supposed to be backed one-for-one to the dollar was getting printed in large quantities. That clue led the pair to another: When new batches appeared, the price of Bitcoin seemed to jump. It looked like someone, or a group, was using that freshly printed \u201cfree money\u201d to inflate Bitcoin\u2019s price for their own profit. He and his coauthor Shams sifted through an incredible 200 gigabytes of trading data, equal to the troves that the Smithsonian Institution collects in two years, and followed sales and purchases from 2.5 million separate wallets.\n\nIn 2018, they coauthored a groundbreaking study showing that a single, still unidentified, Bitcoin \u201cwhale\u201d almost singlehandedly drove the token\u2019s giant run-up in late 2017 and early 2018 by distorting the trading in the token.\n\nToward the end of 2022, another mystifying trend caught Griffin\u2019s eye. Despite the crypto crash and myriad other negative forces, every time Bitcoin briefly breached the $16,000 floor, it bounced above that level and kept stubbornly trading between $16,000 and $17,000. Almost unbelievably, as the crypto market has continued to unravel into 2023, Bitcoin has gone in the opposite direction, trading up 35% since Jan. 7 to $23,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very suspicious,\u201d Griffin told Fortune. \u201cThe same mechanism we saw in 2017 could be at play now in the still unreal Bitcoin market.\u201d\n\nFor Griffin, the way normally super-volatile Bitcoin went calm and stable in the stormiest of times for crypto fits a scenario where boosters are uniting to support and juice its price. \u201cIf you\u2019re a crypto manipulator, you want to set a floor under the price of your coin,\u201d added Griffin. \u201cIn a period of highly negative sentiment, we\u2019ve seen suspiciously solid floors under Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThough manipulation is unproven, the signs are troubling\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that no definitive proof of chicanery has so far emerged. \u201cThe space is bigger now so it\u2019s harder to dig the data,\u201d says Griffin. \u201cSophisticated players may be expert at hiding their identities.\u201d We have seen credible leaks asserting that major market participants call meetings of the sector\u2019s elite when they fear a crypto leader plans to make what they consider a reckless, industry-endangering move. But no evidence has surfaced that the players are gathering to coordinate buying of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. For example it's well known that earlier this fall Changpeng Zhao (known as CZ), chief of Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange and other crypto crypto leaders believed that Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s hedge fund Alameda was attacking Tether, the then-wobbling coin whose reliability is crucial to the industry\u2019s well-being, and reportedly encouraged him to stop. (Tether\u2014symbol USDT\u2014by the way, was also at the center of the 2017-18 manipulation exposed by Griffin and Shams.)\n\nIt's possible that evidence of cozy, clubby practices will come to light in the numerous bankruptcy proceedings, lawsuits, and criminal investigations now pending in the crypto-verse. \u201cNow that SBF is being charged, he\u2019ll turn on the other players and could accuse them of collusion,\u201d predicts Alex de Vries, an economist at the central bank of the Netherlands who runs Digiconomist, a site that tracks Bitcoin\u2019s carbon footprint. The collapse Genesis's lending business has set Barry Silbert, the head of its parent Digital Currency Group, at the throats of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, cofounders of floundering exchange Gemini. The brothers claim that DCG owes the $900 million that Gemini\u2019s depositors loaned to a Genesis program that paid high interest rates and threaten to sue DCG and Silbert, whom they accuse of stonewalling and denying DCG's true liability. Put simply, as onetime allies battle in court, the secrecy surrounding trading in concert, if it exists, could well crumble.\n\nGriffin is far from the only prominent observer who\u2019s wary of bad behavior. In a blog post on Nov. 30 titled \u201cBitcoin\u2019s Last Stand,\u201d European Central Bank Director General for market operations Ulrich Bindseil and ECB adviser J\u00fcrgen Schaaf dismissed Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence as \u201can artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance.\u201d Two leading figures on Wall Street told this writer on background that Bitcoin\u2019s price action, by resisting a flood of bad news, looks phony and different from a normal free market ruled by independent buyers and sellers.\n\nBitcoin has showed amazing stability amid negative sentiment\n\nThe leading sign that Bitcoin\u2019s benefiting from coordinated buying: its astoundingly steady performance, forming the base for a takeoff to five-month highs following the FTX debacle that seemed likely to send the mainstay token reeling. From Nov. 5, the day before the FTX reports started spreading, to Nov. 9, Bitcoin (based on closing prices) dropped from $21,300 to $15,900, its lowest reading since late 2020, for a fall of 25%. Then the normally careening coin went, by Bitcoin standards, flat. In the 62 days between Nov. 10 and Jan. 11, it traded in the $16,000s and $17,000s for all but one day. In the 50 days from Nov. 22 to Jan. 11, its closing prices hovered in a narrow band, from a low of $16,200 and a high of $17,900, a difference from bottom to top of 10%.\n\nThis initial period of supersmooth sailing was atypical, to put it mildly. Fortune data editor Scott DeCarlo ran a detailed analysis and found that since the start of 2017, Bitcoin has never fluctuated in any of the 40 consecutive 50-day spans by less than 19%, and varied by over 30% in three out of four seven-week time frames. The median low to high reading was 44%. Hence, Bitcoin at peak FTX-induced turmoil showed both its smallest swings ever by a wide margin, and divergence from low to high that was one-fourth to one-fifth its average over the past six years.\n\nThen, from Jan. 12 to 24, Bitcoin began a bizarre upward march. During those two weeks, it rebounded by 28% from $17,935 to $23,000, its best price since August and well above the number when FTX fears began raging. This occurred while the market was digesting the bankruptcies of lender BlockFi on Nov. 28; Core Scientific, one of the largest publicly traded miners, on Dec. 21; and the Genesis lending arm a month later.\n\nYou\u2019d think that the turmoil surrounding Bitcoin would have shaken the confidence of small investors and institutions alike in crypto, leading to lots of selling pressure and sharply falling prices. Indeed, sentiment on social media turned heavily against Bitcoin following the FTX catastrophe. Reflecting the sinking enthusiasm was a steep retreat in trading activity. At Coinbase, volumes in Q4 were well below Q3 readings, and down 52% from Q1.\n\nCould there be alternate explanations for Bitcoin's robust performance? A number of experts who follow crypto trading from day to day see no plot to inflate the prices, but a well-functioning market. \u201cI don\u2019t see a cabal of insiders,\u201d says Andrew Thurman, a researcher at Blockchain analytics provider Nansen. \u201cThe price movements in Bitcoin are notoriously cyclical by nature. Often the best explanation is the most boring one. In this case, the price of Bitcoin is rising because there are more buyers than sellers. If anything, fallen players such as Celsius and FTX were selling Bitcoin and pushing down prices to prop up their own coins.\u201d Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at Norwegian crypto data analysis firm Arcane Research, agrees. \u201cI don\u2019t see a group holding up prices. Now we have a balanced dynamic. The forced selling following the FTX collapse has to some extent been absorbed and we\u2019re seeing no further forced selling,\u201d a phenomenon that\u2019s aided Bitcoin\u2019s recent rebound to over $23,000.\n\nBut there's no question that Bitcoin's post-FTX sturdiness, capped by its new jump, is a gigantic gift to the enterprises whose fortunes wax and wane with Bitcoin\u2019s price. The stocks for exchanges, miners, and lenders all took a big leg down in the days after meltdown. But since hitting two-year lows in December, miners Riot, Marathon, and Bitfarms have jumped 92%, 150%, and 189% respectively as of Jan. 27. Coinbase, one of the world\u2019s largest exchanges, has advanced 85% from its pre\u2013New Year\u2019s trough, adding $7 billion in market cap. Riot, Bitfarms have all rebounded to near their plateaus just prior to the FTX disaster.\n\nOne of the players most desperate for a boost got a big one. At MicroStrategy, cofounder and executive chairman Michael Saylor loaded his hybrid software provider and Bitcoin speculator with $2.4 billion in debt to buy coins, and when prices fell below $16,000 on Nov. 11, owed far more on his loans than the value of his cache of tokens. If Bitcoin kept dropping, MicroStrategy was heading for big trouble. But Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence has lifted MicroStrategy\u2019s holdings out of the red and sent its stock price from $166 in mid-November to $258 on Jan. 27, a gain of 55%.\n\nCrypto operates on a narrower edge than virtually any other financial sector. The factor that determines whether the big crypto players mint profits or tumble into bankruptcy is the price of Bitcoin, the benchmark that in turn leads the prices for other coins. Much of the crypto world has already shattered. But a lot more stalwarts were due to go down unless Bitcoin found a decent foundation after the FTX downfall shook that slender edge.\n\nGriffin and Shams\u2019 findings from the 2017\u201318 rigging are echoing today\n\nThe Griffin-Shams study of the forces behind the 2017\u201318 Bitcoin bubble provides a guide to the strategies that could be pressing a thumb on the sales post-FTX. Griffin and Shams, now a professor at Ohio State\u2019s Fisher College of Business, first published their 118-page report in 2018, and it appeared two years later in the prestigious, peer-reviewed Journal of Finance.\n\nFor the team, a tipoff for possible manipulation was that Bitfinex, the large exchange closely related to Tether, wasn\u2019t providing much transparency about the supposed stablecoin. \u201cWe saw blogs speculating that Bitfinex wasn\u2019t providing full backing for the coin,\u201d recalls Griffin. \u201cIf someone\u2019s printing money by printing Tether that\u2019s unbacked by fiat currency, it could cause a bubble in Bitcoin,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the hypothesis.\u201d\n\nGriffin and Shams found that two practices converged to spur those huge, sudden gains. The first: a flood of newly created coins that gave the fraudster the currency to goose Bitcoin. The second is the approach that\u2019s most relevant today, in which the manipulator or manipulators agree that every time the price drops to a target level, they\u2019ll jump in to push it well above that benchmark.\n\nThe pair saw a strong and questionable pattern in Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin had its biggest spikes when two things happened: Prices started dropping, and lot of Tether was being printed. Then, as now, Tether was the most important \u201cstablecoin,\u201d or cryptocurrency supposedly supported one-to-one by reserves in fiat currency. Tether\u2019s effectively a stand-in for the dollar; each coin is supposed to be backed by the equivalent of one greenback in fiat currency. Tether is issued by an arm of iFinex, a Hong Kong company that also owns what was then the world\u2019s largest exchange, Bitfinex.\n\nThe authors focused on the 1% of all one-hour intervals between the beginning of March 2017 and end of March 2018 that featured the largest combinations of large Tether issuance on Bitfinex, and big Bitcoin buys on two other exchanges, Bittrex and Poloniex. Just before the start of each period, Bitcoin prices were under pressure. But in each case, it appeared that a single huge buyer rode to the rescue, pushing the token sharply higher by the end of the 60-minute interlude. The \u201cwhale,\u201d whose identity remains a mystery, was using Tether to buy Bitcoin and hike its price. \u201cWe saw a regular pattern of very sizable price reversals,\u201d recalls Shams.\n\nThe 95 one-hour spans that witnessed those big Tether and Bitcoin inflows accounted for nearly 60% of Bitcoin\u2019s immense gains over those 13 months.\n\n\u201cTether is used as cash to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,\u201d notes Shams. Although the market cap of Tether is a fraction of Bitcoin\u2019s, Tether\u2019s trading volumes are higher. Given its importance in trading, the printing of Tether without backing creates \u201cnew money\u201d the way the Fed does when it prints excess quantities of dollars. \u201cThe issuing of Tether without backing inflated the amount of currency chasing the same supply of Bitcoin,\u201d Griffin told Fortune. \u201cThe Tether created from thin air was inflating the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nOnce the whale obtained the newly minted Tether, it traded the coins for big quantities of Bitcoin on Bittrex and Poloniex. Those large buys reversed the downward trend in Bitcoin and boosted its price well above its level before the dip began. \u201cThis player either showed clairvoyant market timing or exerted an extremely large effect on Bitcoin\u2019s price,\u201d states the study. Today, it\u2019s clear that Tether wasn\u2019t holding full reserves behind the coins in this Bitcoin boom period, so that \u201cit\u2019s almost mechanical that money from nowhere would boost the price,\u201d notes Griffin.\n\nAfter the paper appeared, Tether Ltd. insisted that its conclusions were flawed and maintained that Tether couldn\u2019t be used to balloon Bitcoin prices. But a Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation found otherwise. In October 2021, the CFTC won a $41 million settlement from Tether and its owners for failing to back its coins with dollars as advertised. The CFTC found that \u201cTether held sufficient reserves to back\u2026tokens in circulation only 27.6% of the time in the 26-month sample from 2016 through 2018\u201d and \u201ccomingled reserve funds with Bitfinex\u2019s operational and customer funds.\u201d Says Griffin, \u201cBitcoin and Tether aren\u2019t used for buying things like cars and pizzas, they\u2019re used for buying other coins. So in that closed system, a relatively small amount of manipulated buying, spurred by creating new coins from nothing, can cause an outsize increase in the Bitcoin price.\u201d\n\nThe whale mastered setting a floor and kept the floor rising\n\nThe authors also found that the sizable purchases frequently happened when Bitcoin\u2019s price reached certain thresholds, just below multiples of $500. \u201cWe saw far more purchases at those benchmarks,\u201d says Griffin. \u201cThe whale kept establishing price floors, and those floors kept rising. It wasn\u2019t a club. It was one entity. But when the whale held the price at the thresholds, that made it look as if Bitcoin was safe at those floors. That made it look safe for funds and small customers to buy Bitcoin, driving the price still higher.\u201d Adds Shams, \u201cAround round number price levels of Bitcoin, we saw activities consistent with creating price supports.\u201d\n\nGriffin suspects that a similar dynamic is operating today. He says that collusion to prop up Bitcoin would mean that a clique of buyers agrees to purchase together when the price nears a floor. Let\u2019s say that trigger is $16,000, a figure Bitcoin almost always remained just above during its time of extreme stability. If Bitcoin experiences heavy sales threatening to drive its price below $16,000, in our example, the whale club enters en masse. \u201cThat $16,000, for example, could serve as a coordinating mechanism,\u201d says Griffin. The manipulators could drive the price up to near $17,000, then sell part of their winnings in many small trades that don\u2019t move the market. They could pocket big profits just letting the price bounce back and forth in the tunnel between $16,000 and $17,000.\n\nGrowing confidence that Bitcoin won\u2019t breach $16,000 would encourage more speculators to join in the buying. Then the group can agree to set a new floor at $18,000. \u201cIn crypto, a group of manipulators can push Bitcoin to higher floors unless a big party moves against them,\u201d says Griffin. But it\u2019s much harder to short Bitcoin than to short stocks or bonds. We aren\u2019t seeing evidence of another group moving to drive down the price, giving a stronger hand to any possible club of bulls. \u201cMost of the players in the space have a strong incentive to maintain a price floor,\u201d says Griffin.\n\nIn conclusion, Griffin says, the Griffin-Shams study showed concrete proof of manipulation in 2017 and 2018, and that a single individual did the rigging. \u201cWe don\u2019t have concrete analysis this time,\u201d he says. \u201cThe truth may emerge in specific stories, if there is collusion.\u201d The lesson, he says, \u201cis that the Bitcoin market remains highly vulnerable to manipulation.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin in the wake of the FTX debacle has registered a wondrous performance. Maybe too wondrous to be trusted."

        "title": "Five reasons why millionaires are back investing in Bitcoin - FinTech Magazine",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the leading decentralised digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network without a central authority, has become the focus of investors recently due to several factors.\n\nIn fact, a recent report by the financial services company deVere Group, analysed data that revealed an astonishing 82% of millionaires are now seeking advice on Bitcoin investment.\n\nAccording to the report, Eight out of 10 high net worth (HNW) individuals have asked their financial advisers about including cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, into their portfolios over the last 12 months - despite the market experiencing a difficult year in 2022.\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains a highly speculative and volatile investment, its growing mainstream acceptance and increasing institutional adoption have made it a focus for investors looking for alternative investment opportunities. It is important for potential investors to thoroughly understand the risks and volatility associated with Bitcoin before investing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive reasons why HNW investors are buying up Bitcoin\n\n# 1 Scarcity\n\n\n\nBitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, making it a scarce asset, which has attracted investors looking for an alternative to traditional investments. Its \u2018limited edition\u2019 availability means that even though its value has risen, and plummeted, and risen over the years, as the world\u2019s most popular crypto currency, it will, most likely, always hold a reasonable price.\n\n\n\n\n\n# 2 Volatility\n\n\n\nStrangely enough, Bitcoin's volatility is one of the reasons why its so popular with investors. The price can fluctuate greatly in short periods of time, creating potential for high returns, but also higher risk. For big ticket market players who can afford to watch and wait for the value to rise, it's a good bet.\n\n\n\n\n\n#3 Decentralisation\n\n\n\nThe decentralised nature of Bitcoin has made it attractive to investors who are seeking to diversify their portfolios away from traditional financial systems that are often subject to government control and regulation. Privacy is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain as governments continuously seek to regulate and control the crypto market.\n\n\n\n\n\n#4 Increased institutional adoption\n\n\n\nIn recent years, major financial institutions and corporations have shown increasing interest in Bitcoin, lending credibility to the asset and further fuelling investor interest. El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender in 2022, while banks are expanding their cryptocurrency services in a bid to keep up with the more agile and innovative fintechs.\n\n\n\nJPMorgan, like many other major legacy financial institutions, including Fidelity, BlackRock and New York Bank Mellon, have also begun to offer crypto-related services to their clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n#5 Macroeconomic factors\n\n\n\nThe economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as low interest rates and increased monetary stimulus, has also contributed to a rise in Bitcoin's popularity among investors.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Bitcoin is growing in popularity again?\n\nSpeaking about the results of the recent study, Nigel Green, the CEO and founder of deVere Group, notes: \u201cIn 2022, the crypto market delivered its worst performance since 2018, with Bitcoin, the headline-grabbing market leader, falling about 75% during the year.\n\n\u201cThe price drops came as investors reduced their exposure to risk-on assets, including stocks and crypto, due to heightened concerns about inflation and slower economic growth.\n\n\u201cYet against this backdrop of the so-called \u2018crypto winter\u2019, HNWs were consistently seeking advice from their financial advisers about including digital currencies into their portfolios.\u201d\n\nHe continues: \u201cInterestingly, this typically more conservative group was not deterred by the bear market and adverse market conditions. Instead, they were looking to either start including or increasing their exposure to crypto.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that these high-net-worth clients are increasingly aware of the inherent characteristics of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin which has the core values of being digital, global, borderless, decentralised and tamper-proof.\n\n\u201cWealthy investors understand that digital currencies are the future of money, and they don\u2019t want to be left in the past.\u201d\n\nMany of these HNWs who were polled will also have seen a consistent surge in interest being expressed by institutional investors, including Wall Street giants, who bring further capital, influence and confidence to the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the crypto winter thawing?\n\nThe deVere CEO believes that this momentum of interest is set to build further as the \u2018crypto winter\u2019 of 2022 is thawing.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is on track for its best January since 2013 based on hopes that inflation has peaked, monetary policies become more favourable, and the various crypto-sector crises including high-profile bankruptcies are now in the rear-view mirror,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency is up over 40% since the turn of the year and this will not go unnoticed by HNW clients and others who want to build wealth for the future.\u201d\n\nGreen added, \u201cIf HNWs were expressing such huge interest in the 2022 bear market, as market conditions steadily improve, they\u2019re going to be amongst the first to capitalise in the forthcoming bull run.\u201d\n\n\n\n"

Bitcoin runs DOOM.\n\nTo the delight of crypto Twitter and Reddit circles, someone has uploaded a cloned version of the 30-year-old video game classic DOOM to the Bitcoin blockchain as an inscription on the network\u2019s own NFT protocol, Ordinals.\n\nThanks to a happenstance loophole enabled by Bitcoin\u2019s Taproot upgrade pushed in Nov. 2021, a budget (read: free) version of DOOM has been permanently etched on a single satoshi via block 774526, which was added to the blockchain on Wednesday morning.\n\nBeing written to Bitcoin means the functional game will forever live on the immutable blockchain. As long as the network is online, folks can play this version of DOOM.\n\nWeb browsers are still required to compile the code, but forcing unconventional technologies to run DOOM is a meme in tech culture. Crafty hackers have made DOOM run via pregnancy tests, calculators, ATMs, smart watches, toasters and Pelotons \u2014 even \u201cunhackable\u201d crypto wallets, among other zany conduits.\n\nWhile the clone is fun in its own blocky-and-basic way, an actual copy of the real DOOM looks destined to make it to the Bitcoin blockchain sometime soon (a Reddit thread from Feb. 2018 suggests DOOM was once playable on Ethereum, however the linked YouTube video is now unavailable).\n\nDOOM on Bitcoin via a single satoshi\n\nMeanwhile, Ordinals continues to pepper conversation amongst Bitcoiners as the community parses what bringing NFTs to the oldest blockchain really means for the future of network and the NFT ecosystem writ large.\n\nThe protocol notably just enabled the biggest-ever Bitcoin block to be mined. A high-definition \u201cTaproot wizard\u201d was inscribed to a satoshi this week, clocking a 3.96MB transaction \u2014 close to Bitcoin\u2019s 4MB block size limit (originally 1MB but stretchable via SegWit).\n\nAs for the DOOM Ordinal, it was only 31.2 KB big.\n\nRemember: It\u2019s not the size that matters.

        "content": "You couldn\u2019t miss it if you tried. From YouTube adverts starring celebrity comedians to incessant news stories touting another broken price record, \u201cit\u201d was cryptocurrency, a movement taking the world by storm in 2021 and 2022. Largely born out of libertarian currents in the wake of the last financial crisis and limited in scope to Internet subcommunities for years, crypto had finally entered into the mainstream.\n\nHarvard was not immune from this explosion of enthusiasm. On campus, the first-ever undergraduate organization focused on blockchain was founded, while internships and offers of employment at cryptocurrency firms became ubiquitous and irresistible.\n\nThough the highs of 2021 have mostly subsided and the allure of a blockchain future has been greatly diminished by scandals such as the spectacular collapses of the LUNA \u201cstablecoin\u201d network and the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, it still remains unclear why crypto, a technology more than a decade old, was only able to have its moment in the sun over the past couple of years.\n\nThe classic answer given by pundits has been \u201ceasy money,\u201d the notion that rock-bottom interest rates set by the Federal Reserve had made it far too tempting for deep-pocketed investors to go all in on moonshot ideas like upending the global monetary system. There may certainly be some truth to that, but it can\u2019t explain how crypto captured the popular imagination, not to mention sovereign governments \u2014 how it was able to persuade a solid fifth of Americans and millions of others around the world, spanning across class and cultural boundaries, to risk their financial well-being for the sake of something new.\n\nThis question was somewhere in the back of my mind as I was strolling through the Harvard Art Museums toward the end of the fall semester. Having long been a nerdy numismatist, I soon found myself (again) on the third floor, gawking at the Roman coin collection, which boasts selections from the Late Republican era (1st century BCE) to the Late Antique (3rd-5th centuries BCE).\n\nThe temporal diversity of the collection makes it easy to spot clear compositional differences between coins cast at the opposite ends of the Pax Romana. And while it might not be fair to assume so at first glance, the quality of the coins differ significantly too. By and large, Roman coins, being minted by a central imperial authority, consistently underwent a process of debasement as a smaller and smaller amount of precious metals were used in their manufacture. For instance, whereas the silver denarius was 94 percent pure during the reign of Nero (54 \u2013 68 CE), coins minted by Claudius Victorinus when he ascended to the throne two centuries later in 268 CE were basically junk metal, containing only 0.02 percent of real silver. To many emperors, the logic was simple. Expensive wars required costly expenditures, and what was easier \u2014 raising (and collecting) taxes or simply keeping more bullion in the public coffers by reducing how much was spent on currency?\n\nWhile the thesis that this regular debasement over centuries contributed to the ultimate downfall of the Roman state is hotly debated, the notion that the practice was common knowledge among the populus Romanus is more widely acknowledged. Salaries provided to regular soldiers steadily increased as coin purity decreased, while auxiliary forces recruited from \u201cbarbarian\u201d forces increasingly demanded their pay in pure gold form. The once-unquestioned authority of the Roman state to control the mediums of exchange in its sphere of influence was gradually shredded to tatters.\n\nAmong the many parallels that politicians and thinkers so often draw between the Roman world and ours, especially with respect to the dominating nature of American cultural influence, perhaps one that should be heeded with caution is the loss of public trust in the Roman \u201cfinancial\u201d system and the one that we live with today. While there are certainly very significant differences in their respective architectures \u2014 namely that we no longer seek to chain our monetary supply with the availability of precious specie \u2014 surely we can compare the qualities of public sentiment.\n\nAfter all, money still largely serves the same social functions in our world as it did in our forefathers\u2019, and as with any medium of exchange, unanimous agreement about the value of money is absolutely essential to its continued survival. Once collective trust in its worth erodes beyond some critical point, individuals may be incentivized to seek alternatives. While the Romans may have found refuge in the visible constancy of aurum, as many \u201cgold bugs\u201d still do today, crypto seems to be the new, very popular, kid on the block.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, it doesn\u2019t seem coincidental that a mass media motif that was just as pervasive recently as the rise of cryptocurrency was the imminent threat of inflationary pressures in the United States and globally. Think-tankers lined up to provide their version of how rising prices came to be, with some pointing back to the \u201ceasy money\u201d policies of central banks and others blaming everything from the pandemic to the war in Ukraine. What was much less disputed was the effects of inflation on the average psyche, as popular discontent shot upward, fueled by the widely held belief that central authorities were to blame somehow for the newfound crisis.\n\nFramed in these terms, it may be much less of a mystery why cryptocurrency has appealed to so many so recently. It has been, in essence, a passive revolt against establishment institutions, driven by the same kind of sentiment and notions of a \u201cbreak from the big banks\u201d that drove thousands to Occupy Wall Street more than a decade ago.\n\nYes, crypto\u2019s fifteen minutes of fame has likely elapsed, but extensive mistrust of the present financial status quo lingers. Public policy must thus be willing to address these eddies of economic disaffection, lest our currency too goes the way of the Romans\u2019.\n\nAlexander Junxiang Chen \u201924 is a Neuroscience and Chemistry concentrator in Quincy House.

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies had a very dramatic year in 2022. After a period of explosive growth for many coins, higher interest rates combined with a few spectacular collapses made the industry lose $2 trillion in value.\n\n\n\nParts of the crypto industry have begun to bounce back recently. Bitcoin, for example, has surged 40% in value since the start of 2023. Last weekend, it crossed the $23,000 threshold and continues to remain robust. Mark Cuban of Shark Tank fame defended Bitcoin last month as an instrument of stored value despite soured sentiment. And longtime crypto evangelist Cathie Wood has even gone so far as to say that she thinks Bitcoin will surpass $1.5 million by the end of the decade.\n\nBut not everyone is sold on Bitcoin. Founder of Bridgewater Associates and legendary investor Ray Dalio sees Bitcoin as \u201ca tiny thing\u201d that is unstable and often receives \u201cdisproportionate attention.\u201d The investor compared the value of Bitcoin to Microsoft\u2014the cryptocurrency is less than a third of what the tech giant is valued at\u2014and added that the coin has \u201cno relation to anything.\u201d\n\nBut he acknowledges that in a changing world, consumers want to find ways to store their wealth and secure their buying power.\n\n\u201cWe are in a world where money as we know it is in jeopardy,\u201d Dalio said in an interview Thursday with CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box. \u201cWe are printing too much, and it\u2019s not just the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are going to say, \u2018Where is my safe store of wealth?\u2019\u201d he noted. \u201cI think the question over the next number of years is really \u2018What is money?\u2019 Not just a medium of exchange but a storehold of wealth.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlthough Dalio doesn\u2019t think of Bitcoin as a stable store of value, and he shot down the idea of stablecoins, he didn\u2019t write off digital currencies altogether, and discussed a possible future that could include inflation-linked digital coins.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see probably the development of coins that you haven\u2019t seen that probably will end up being attractive, viable coins. I don\u2019t think Bitcoin is it,\u201d he said.\n\nDalio isn\u2019t the only major investor deeply skeptical of Bitcoin. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a \u201chyped-up fraud\u201d in January while defending the broader technology that powers it as useful. Former options trader and author of The Black Swan, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, has referred to Bitcoin as a \u201ctumor\u201d in the economy that has grown in an uncontrolled manner."

        "content": "FTX customers still don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to get their money back; Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal trial is ongoing; and the Crypto Winter of deflated coin values continues to drag on. But one of cryptocurrency\u2019s biggest optimists still says the coin that started it all is primed for a massive comeback.\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s ARK Investment Management, the firm that has continued to buy crypto and shares of crypto companies even during the sector\u2019s historic downturn over the past year, is betting on Bitcoin rising to new heights soon enough. All investors need is a little patience and faith.\n\nARK forecasted Bitcoin to bounce back from its current lows to eventually be worth $1.48 million by 2030 in a new report published this week, a bullish scenario that would see Bitcoin\u2019s value rising by more than 6,300% in just seven years.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at around $23,000, a far cry from its all-time high of nearly $70,000 achieved in November 2021. Those were good times for crypto bulls, when up to a quarter of holders were convinced that Bitcoin could exceed $100,000 in fewer than five years. Cathie Wood was exceptionally upbeat about Bitcoin\u2019s chances, even predicting in 2021 that it could hit $500,000 by 2026 if institutional investors and investment banks began piling in.\n\nThat was also peak crypto, as it turns out. As inflation rose last year and enthusiasm for speculative assets including cryptocurrencies dwindled, the Crypto Winter began and coins tumbled in value.\n\nIn the 12 months after its November 2021 peak, the sector shaved off over $2 trillion in value, with Bitcoin in particular down 65% since then. Crypto companies that had become mainstays, including Coinbase and Genesis, began cutting back and laying off staff. A number of crypto companies including Three Arrows Capital and Celsius filed for bankruptcy, while the entire industry was rocked in November when FTX, one of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges, collapsed and lost over $8 billion in customer funds.\n\nBut through it all, Cathie Wood and ARK have held firm on their big Bitcoin bet. Even during the cataclysmic FTX implosion, ARK research director Frank Downing said the firm\u2019s conviction in Bitcoin\u2019s underlying blockchain technology had \u201conly increased\u201d in the wake of the crash. In December, Wood tweeted that the Bitcoin blockchain \u201cdidn\u2019t skip a beat\u201d during the FTX debacle, which she took to signify the coin\u2019s transparency and resilience during downtimes.\n\nOver the next seven years, ARK expects Bitcoin to become a \u201cmultitrillion-dollar market\u201d because of its strong fundamentals, according to the new report, as the firm expects the crypto asset to outperform \u201cevery major asset class over longer time horizons.\u201d The sector\u2019s recent difficulties may even help restore trust in Bitcoin in the long term as exchange companies become more transparent with their finances to avoid a similar fate that befell FTX, ARK argued. Institutional investors including BlackRock and Fidelity have not wavered on their commitment to Bitcoin despite the market downturn, the report also found, reinforcing the coin\u2019s fundamentals.\n\nEven in ARK\u2019s \u201cbear case\u201d scenario, Bitcoin\u2019s value is expected to rise to a record $258,500 by 2030. In the firm\u2019s \u201cbase case\u201d scenario, Bitcoin will grow to be worth $682,800."

        "content": "A New York City woman has been charged with using cryptocurrency to provide financial support to terrorist groups in Syria, a rare prosecution involving virtual currency to fund terrorism.\n\nThe 11-count indictment charged Victoria Jacobs, 43, who was known as Bakhrom Talipov, with providing support for an act of terrorism, money laundering and other crimes.\n\nJacobs provided material support to Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S. State Department-designated foreign terrorist organization, and provided more than $5,000 to the terrorist training group Malhama Tactical, which fought with and provided special tactical and military training to Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, the indictment said.\n\n\"This case marks the first time that terrorism financing is being prosecuted in New York State Court and is one of the rare cases worldwide where cryptocurrency is alleged to have financed terrorism,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement.\n\nJacobs allegedly laundered $10,661 on behalf of Malhama Tactical by receiving cryptocurrency and Western Union and MoneyGram wires from supporters around the globe and sending the funds to Bitcoin wallets controlled by Malhama Tactical. In addition to sending cryptocurrency, she also purchased Google Play gift cards for the organization, according to the indictment.\n\nIn October 2018, the defendant saved notes on her cellphone, which the indictment quoted as saying \"Assalamu aleykum my dear brothers and sisters, we currently are buildings new place (train camp), it's getting cold and we need new place, who want help us and support can do this safely and anonymously by Bitcoin wallet. Send me DM for details. Retweet.\"\n\nRepresentations of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum, DogeCoin, Ripple and Litecoin are placed on PC motherboard in this illustration taken, June 29, 2021. Dado Ruvic/Reuters/Illustration, FILE\n\nIn December 2019, Jacobs provided a comprehensive U.S. Army Improvised Munitions Handbook to an online group -- which she believed was associated with both Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham and al-Qaeda affiliated Jihadist group Hurras al-Din -- to facilitate their bomb-making efforts in Syria, the indictment said.\n\nProsecutors said Jacobs bought military-style combat knives, metal knuckles and throwing stars in August 2021 that were found in her Upper East Side apartment.\n\n\"Disturbingly, approximately one month later, on September 21-22, 2021, the defendant, in a Telegram chat, claimed to be a 'brother' who was 'behind enemy lines' and asked for prayers for the 'courage, strength, guidance, and wisdom to carry out certain missions,'\" Assistant District Attorney Edward Burns said in a court filing.\n\n\"Along with these statements, defendant posted a 15-second video clip of an unknown person ominously moving around with a firearm,\" he continued. \"The timing of this post and the defendant's acquisition of the weapons supports the conclusion that she intended to use the weapons in an unlawful manner.\"\n\nJacobs is being held without bail.\n\nIn a parallel investigation, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn charged four defendants in December with crowdfunding support for ISIS using cryptocurrency, Bitcoin wallets, GoFundMe and PayPal to collect what they called \"blood money.\""

The crypto is currently trading flat at $23,031 on Wednesday, according to Messari.\n\nArk detailed the token's outlook in a new report, which predicted that bitcoin could \"scale into a multi-trillion dollar market\" by the end of the decade. Even the famed money manager's bear case for bitcoin is a price target of $258,500 in the next seven years, a 1,022% increase from the crypto's current price.\n\nThe firm maintained that bitcoin's fundamentals are sound despite a turbulent 2022. To support its bold calls, the report pointed to continued institutional adoption, higher hash rates, and long-term holder supply of bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bullish estimates come amid a severe and lengthy crypto market rut. Bitcoin is down 65% from its all-time high in November 2021, with the industry's total market value off over 64% from its peak.\n\nCrypto markets took hits in the past year on inflation concerns, leaving traders with little risk appetite, along with a series of industry bankruptcies, which caused widespread contagion. Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX, crypto fund Three Arrows Capital, and centralized lender Celsius all landed in bankruptcy court.\n\n\"Contagion caused by centralized counterparties has elevated Bitcoin's value propositions: decentralization, auditability, and transparency,\" the report said. \"Its network fundamentals have strengthened and its holder base has become more long-term focused.\"\n\nThis isn't Wood's or Ark's first eyebrow-raising price prediction. In May of 2021, Wood told Bloomberg that bitcoin will likely rise to $500,000 in 2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We think bitcoin is coming out of this smelling like a rose,\" she said after FTX's market-moving bankruptcy filing.\n\nArk continues to double down on its crypto-related bets despite the downturn in digital assets. Since the start of the year, Ark's flagship exchange-traded fund, ARKK, bought 108,548 Coinbase shares, worth $6.3 million at its current price. ARKK surged 28% in January, notching its best monthly performance ever."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a dismal outing last year, bitcoin has skyrocketed more than 40% to start the new year. But John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, thinks there's something suspicious going on, according to Fortune.\n\nHe had a similar inkling of foul play in 2017, when he and a colleague noticed that a single bitcoin \"whale\" seemed to drive the token's price and distort trading.\n\nIn 2018, Griffin and Amin Shams published a 118-page report that detailed their proof of bitcoin market manipulation by a single entity. Two years later, the report was picked up by the peer-reviewed Journal of Finance.\n\nToday, he sees parallels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's very suspicious,\" Griffin told Fortune. \"The same mechanism we saw in 2017 could be at play now in the still unreal bitcoin market.\"\n\nHe explained that a token manipulator would want to set a floor price for their asset, which seems to be the case now for bitcoin, which typically sees high volatility rather than stability.\n\n\"In a period of highly negative sentiment, we've seen suspiciously solid floors under bitcoin,\" he said.\n\nGriffin maintained that the sheer size of the crypto market and the amount of data has made definitive proof elusive. Not only that, but he said bad actors are sophisticated enough to hide their identities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, one finding from Griffin's research five years ago was that sizable bitcoin purchases happened when the token reached certain thresholds.\n\n\"We saw far more purchases at those benchmarks,\" Griffin said. \"The whale kept establishing price floors, and those floors kept rising. It wasn't a club. It was one entity. But when the whale held the price at the thresholds, that made it look as if bitcoin was safe at those floors. That made it look safe for funds and small customers to buy bitcoin, driving the price still higher.\"\n\nBitcoin price floor manipulation\n\nDuring bitcoin's latest run, it's peculiar how reliably bitcoin bounced above $16,000 seemingly the moment it breached that level, he said. That dynamic was evident when Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX was crashing.\n\nIn a five-day stretch in November, bitcoin plunged 25% to $15,900. Then, according to Fortune calculations, the token traded between $16,000 to $18,000 every single day leading up to January 11 except for one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor bitcoin to exhibit that degree of stability is unusual. FTX marked one of the largest collapses in crypto and financial history, yet the price of the world's largest token saw some of the smallest swings ever.\n\nToday, Griffin believes that bitcoin remains \"highly vulnerable to manipulation,\" per Fortune.\n\n\"We don't have concrete analysis this time,\" he added. \"The truth may emerge in specific stories, if there is collusion.\""

        "content": "A new protocol released on Bitcoin is bringing wider NFT capabilities to the world\u2019s largest blockchain, with the potential to reshape the NFT market and the dynamic between some of the biggest blockchains, industry officials tell Forkast.\n\nThe Ordinals protocol, which was released after a Jan. 21 post by developer Casey Rodarmor, allows users to insert relatively large amounts of data into transactions, which can be used for creating collectible images on the network, similar to many popular NFT projects.\n\nThis capability was previously available on Bitcoin, but on a scale too small for workable NFTs. However, Bitcoin upgrades like 2021\u2019s Taproot and 2017\u2019s SegWit allows the Ordinals protocol to expand this functionality.\n\nJonathon Miller, Australia managing director of U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, said Ordinals is a positive development for the network, but it has also generated controversy.\n\n\u201cThere are purists who say [Bitcoin] should always just be peer-to-peer cash, but I think that\u2019s possibly not the story when it comes to the reality, which is that people experiment with Bitcoin all the time,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt really is exciting to see people build things on top of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWithout this experimentation, the network would not have Layer 2 solutions such as the lightning network, which greatly increases transaction speeds on Bitcoin, he added.\n\nNew killer?\n\nNFTs are regarded as a crucial component of the reimagined internet of Web3 \u2014 in which gaming, social media and financial services are run through decentralized blockchain applications controlled by users\u2019 wallets. And NFTs have long been the domain of the Ethereum blockchain that hosts roughly 70% of all NFT sales value.\n\nMany blockchain networks \u2014 from Cardano to Solana \u2014 have been labelled \u201cEthereum Killers\u201d in recent years, or networks hoping to eat into Ethereum\u2019s dominance in Web3 or NFTs, but so far none have made much headway.\n\nYehudah Petscher, NFT relations strategist for blockchain data aggregator CryptoSlam, said one reason for that is Ethereum has a multi-year head start. But that is not a factor that hinders Bitcoin as the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] been around longer than any others \u2014 ten years now, plus \u2014 they have a huge, huge base of users. So, I almost think there\u2019s potential it could compete with Ethereum more quickly than the others could, simply because of adoption.\u201d\n\nMiller had a different view, saying Ethereum has excellent tools for creating NFTs, whereas Ordinals is just the protocol for creating tools on the Bitcoin network.\n\n\u201cPerhaps [Ordinal\u2019s] not going to be something that competes directly with those networks,\u201d he said. And it may well act as a reminder that Ethereum is a really strong and well-tooled network for creating NFTs.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nPetscher said the real change from Ordinals may not be about creating new types of collectibles, but proving that developers can build upon an old blockchain and change the market dynamics in the process. That could prove to be the real innovation in the project, he added.\n\n\u201c[Ordinals] certainly gives Bitcoin as a currency itself more utility,\u201d he said, \u201cit strictly was almost a financial asset and people were very happy with that. It now has another and one that I expect like on Ethereum and these other blockchains will grow exponentially now you can transact collectibles.\u201d\n\nSome of Ordinal\u2019s critics argue that it will increase the demand on the network, driving up fees for regular transactions. Petscher agrees this is a risk, but said the added utility of being able to purchase the NFTs with Bitcoin could also serve to increase the price, helping many miners and long-term holders within the community.\n\nOthers argue that these are frivolous ways to use the network, however, and detract from the intention Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, had in mind when releasing the original Bitcoin white paper in 2009.\n\n\u201cIt can be all of these things at the same time,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cIt certainly can be frivolous and it can be silly and it could be pointless and it can still be awesome at the same time and important to building a movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd especially in a decentralized world, not only does it not matter but there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d"

        "content": "For nearly a decade, creators have enlisted sidechain or layer-2 solutions to link digital art to the Bitcoin blockchain. But how this is accomplished\u2014or whether it should even be done\u2014has Crypto Twitter up in arms after new project Ordinals developed a way to add digital items to on-chain Bitcoin transactions.\n\nNFT are blockchain tokens that can serve as a proof of ownership for assets, including digital goods like artwork, videos, music files, and memberships. While blockchains like Ethereum and Solana are synonymous with NFTs and digital collectibles, many Bitcoin developers have sought ways to bring them to the quintessential blockchain.\n\nOne issue hampering the development of NFTs on Bitcoin is the need for smart contracts. In the minting process, NFTs use smart contracts to assign ownership of the digital asset in the NFT. The smart contract updates the ownership when the NFT is bought or sold.\n\nBitcoin has only limited smart contract support.\n\nTo address this, earlier projects like Counterparty and Stacks developed alternative solutions that use a native token for the contract piece but ultimately settle their transactions back on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nStacks Blows Up 57% After Bitcoin NFTs Take Off\n\nEarlier examples\n\nIn 2014, Counterparty launched the first layer-2 solution for digital assets using the Bitcoin blockchain. Counterparty, which provides the infrastructure for users to create unique tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, saw its XCP token hit an all-time high above $91 in 2018, but it has fallen about 97% since.\n\nAlthough surpassed by Ethereum and other popular NFT chains in recent years, Counterparty still has an active community of supporters\u2014and its assets can be bridged to Ethereum. More importantly, Counterparty is best known as the home for historical assets like Rare Pepes, which still command significant sums on secondary markets. In April 2022, an NFT containing the opening theme to Larry David\u2019s \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d was minted using Counterparty.\n\nStory continues\n\nLaunched in 2017 as Blockstacks, Stacks (as it\u2019s now known) is a blockchain network that can run smart contracts and rolls up all of its transactions before settling them on Bitcoin. Stacks says it doesn\u2019t use a sidechain or layer-2 model, but founder Muneeb Ali told Decrypt in 2021 that he refers to it as \u201ca layer 1.5\u201d built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nThe STX token hit a peak above $3 in December 2021, according to CoinGecko, as its NFTs started to attract the Bitcoin faithful, and in February 2022, an NFT collection called Satoshibles launched a cross-bridge to send NFTs to the Ethereum network. Broadly, however, Stacks has not developed an especially active or valuable NFT market.\n\nBitcoin: Will It Run Doom? Kinda\n\nWhat's Ordinals?\n\nThe most recent example of Bitcoin NFTs is Ordinals, and it takes a different approach. Launched in January, Ordinals aims to add NFT-like assets directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nDesigned by Casey Rodarmor, a former Bitcoin Core contributor, Ordinals enables users to explore, transfer, and receive individual satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin, or 1/100,000,000 of a BTC), which may include data such as videos and images. Adding assets to individual satoshis is called inscription, which is stored in a Bitcoin transaction\u2019s signature.\n\nThe idea of filling Bitcoin blocks with JPEGs and videos\u2014or even playable video games\u2014isn\u2019t sitting well with some in the Bitcoin community who have voiced concerns that putting NFTs directly on the Bitcoin network will drive up transaction costs.\n\nMarginalized peoples in developing countries will have to pay more to run their Bitcoin nodes and send transactions because privileged wealthy whites want to put JPEG drawings on the blockchain as status symbols. Just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. \u2014 Bitcoin is Saving (@BitcoinIsSaving) January 29, 2023\n\nDespite the controversy, Ordinals brings the quest for NFTs on Bitcoin closer than ever, as it does not require a sidechain or layer-2 solution (or similar) or an additional cryptocurrency to work.\n\nBitcoin remains the top cryptocurrency by market cap, but as Ordinals and past examples show, some developers are still trying to use its decentralized network to power new use cases."

        "content": "MicroStrategy (MSTR) bought 8,813 bitcoins during 2022's major crypto dip, taking a $1.28 billion impairment loss for the year, the company said in its fourth quarter report on Thursday.\n\nAs of December 31, the company had spent a total $3.9 billion to acquire 132,500 bitcoins purchased at an average price of $30,137.\n\nThe company's carrying value of its bitcoin holdings at quarter's end was $1.8 billion. As of Thursday afternoon's bitcoin price, MicroStrategy's stash was worth $3.16 billion.\n\nShares of MicroStrategy were down as much as 3% in after hours trade on Thursday. Shares had gained more than 9% during normal trading hours on Thursday, and the stock has more than doubled so far this year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the business intelligence software company reported revenue of $132.6 million, just beating the $131 million expected by analysts, according to data from Bloomberg.\n\nMicroStrategy reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of $249.7 million.\n\n\"Our corporate strategy and conviction in acquiring, holding, and growing our bitcoin position for the long term remains unchanged,\" said MicroStrategy CFO Andrew Kang.\n\nMicroStrategy took a $197.6 million impairment charge for the fourth quarter on its bitcoin holdings, bringing its cumulative impairment charges related to bitcoin to $2.15 billion.\n\nThe company\u2019s founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has said previously that buying bitcoin has raised its public profile. Saylor stepped down in August from his role as CEO to focus on the company\u2019s bitcoin strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives.\n\nMicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor speaks at the Bitcoin 2021 Convention, a crypto-currency conference held at the Mana Convention Center in Wynwood on June 04, 2021 in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (Joe Raedle via Getty Images)\n\nTo buy bitcoin, MicroStrategy has issued corporate debt, convertible bonds, equity, and taken out a loan with some of its bitcoin.\n\nDuring the quarter, the company issued $46.2 million worth its stock, and as of December 31, MicroStrategy had around $450 million available for sale under its current authorizaton.\n\nOver its fourth quarter, MicroStrategy also sold bitcoin for the first time, harvesting its losses to offset capital gains tax, according to an SEC filing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's massive bitcoin write downs have also brought attention to how cryptocurrencies should be reported on a public corporation's balance sheet.\n\nBy current standards, crypto holdings must be recorded as intangible assets: when prices fall, the value must be written down to the lowest price point for the period. Alternatively, those assets can't be marked up when prices rise until they are sold.\n\nThe treatment will likely change by the end of 2024 according to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which voted Wednesday to issue a proposal for public comment by late March that would have corporates value some crypto at fair value like stocks.\n\nClick here for the latest crypto news, updates, values, prices, and more related to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, DeFi and NFTs\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube"

        "content": "Despite bitcoin's strong January, the cryptocurrency just suffered one of its biggest and longest drawdowns in its history. Ark Invest CEO and Chief Investment Officer Cathie Wood is still bullish on the cryptocurrency, however, and continues betting its price will eventually reach $500,000, she told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday. Her outlook is even \"a little higher than that.\" \"Starting with [the financial crisis of] 2008-2009, which is when bitcoin really debuted, and even more so after the crypto fallout this past year [and] the collapse in many companies, this idea of transparency and decentralization is taking hold, and Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two best manifestations of that in the crypto world,\" Wood said. Wood also said that Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of fallen crypto exchange FTX, whose alleged fraud has shaken investors, \"didn't like bitcoin\" and that his views were at odds with the crypto pillars of decentralization and transparency. \"What companies went under? They were the highly centralized, nontransparent, opaque companies: FTX, Celsius, Three Arrows Capital,\" Wood said. Whereas \"if you look at what happened to Bitcoin, the network, and Ethereum, the network, they really didn't skip a beat at all. Transactions were completed. All smart contracts opened and closed.\" Wood is also a big investor in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust , known by its ticker GBTC, through the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) . Investors have grown concerned about the harm GBTC could do to shareholders, with the shares trading at a growing discount to net asset value and the structure of the trust being such that shares can't be redeemed. \"There's a huge discount there that will close at some point,\" Wood said. \"I have no idea how the lawsuit's going to play out. I do think it's good that this discussion is taking place.\" Last year, Grayscale sued the Securities and Exchange Commission over its decision to block the conversion of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an exchange-traded fund. The D.C. Court of Appeals has scheduled oral arguments for March 7. \"The SEC has dragged its feet in terms of a bitcoin ETF, while approving a bitcoin futures ETF \u2014 it just doesn't make any sense to us,\" Wood added. \"This discussion is going to be a very good one and the news around the trial is going to be very good for bitcoin generally, as more and more people begin to understand bitcoin itself and GBTC particularly.\" Wood just posted her best month ever as her beaten-down favorite stocks staged a big comeback in the new year. Her flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) jumped 3.7% on Tuesday, bringing its January return to 27.8% and marking its strongest month since its inception in 2014."

        "content": "In this issue\n\nValkyrie: Riding high Sam Bankman-Fried: Time to lay low? Chinese NFTs: On display\n\nFrom the editor\u2019s desk Dear Reader, One of the greatest gifts Bitcoin gave the world was its underlying technology: blockchain. It has birthed a financial revolution, channeled capital to parts of the globe that need it, and untethered the power to transact from the few to the many. And now, as we see, in Bitcoin\u2019s strong start to 2023, those long-awaited beams of sunlight have come out to shine on crypto\u2019s firstborn. The question is: Why? What makes tokens work at the most basic level is the technology that underpins them. Yet behind the impressive recent recovery in the value of the world\u2019s original cryptocurrency lies tech that is decidedly old school. The proof-of-work protocol that makes the Bitcoin network tick has long been surpassed on the energy use front by the proof-of-stake mechanisms that power other networks, and the network\u2019s scalability remains limited. Given the ever-higher premiums accorded to sustainable energy and the steady forward march of new technology in the digital asset industry, one might ask: Why still Bitcoin? This is where birthright comes into play. BTC feels like an assuredly different bet \u2014 not just a pure play based on technological dominance, but one that also captures pent-up pressure for change in the wider macroeconomy and the crypto industry. The value of digital assets will be redefined in the coming years, and tokens must prove their fundamental utility and merit beyond the speculative dynamics we\u2019ve seen drive prices higher in the not-too-distant past. Some have proven worthy, but others will fail. Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence is a demonstration that, for some, it is held in higher regard simply for being the coin that started the revolution \u2014 an expression of intrinsic value that combines technology with economic defiance amid the confines of the traditional financial universe. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast\n\n1. BTC boom\n\nValkyrie\u2019s Bitcoin mining ETF surge has been accompanied by gains in the valuations of other crypto-related fund products Image: Valkyrie\n\nBy the numbers: Valkyrie \u2014 over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.\n\nAlternative asset management firm Valkyrie\u2019s Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin Miners exchange-traded fund (ETF), WGMI, has doubled in value over the month of January, as the best-performing U.S. fund of any kind in 2023 so far.\n\nWGMI\u2019s January rally is around 25% higher than that of the second-best performer, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nWGMI closed trading on Tuesday at US$8.88, up nearly 100% from US$4.56 at the beginning of the year, though it is still a long way off its all-time high of US$26.68 last February.\n\nWGMI, an acronym of the popular crypto rallying cry, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna make it,\u201d tracks the performance of crypto mining companies, including Hive Blockchain Technologies, Digihost Technology, Bitfarms, Marathon Digital Holdings, Riot Platforms and Hut 8.\n\nOther crypto-related ETFs, including investment manager VanEck\u2019s Digital Assets Mining (DAM) ETF and Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP), alongside the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH), also ended January higher, up 75%, 64% and 64%, respectively.\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency, has gained 38.4% since the beginning of the year, having enjoyed its best January since 2013 after reaching a five-month high of US$23,918 early morning Hong Kong time on Monday before retracing to US$23,009 at mid-week.\n\nBitcoin broke through the US$23,000 price ceiling last week for the first time since last August.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? The Bitcoin mining industry spent much of last year in retreat. As the price of Bitcoin collapsed, dozens of mining companies began defaulting on loans, while some collapsed completely. Core Scientific, the largest publicly-traded U.S. Bitcoin mining company by computing power, went bankrupt, joining Compute North, another prominent North American miner. The dire situation left lenders that had underwritten the industry to the tune of US$4 billion forced to keep machines running to help recoup debt. Although the fortunes of Bitcoin mining firms have improved somewhat, the situation for the industry remains grim. The era of cheap energy has ended, and authorities in a number of jurisdictions are taking an increasingly dim view of the energy drain \u2014 and sometimes even heightened social tension \u2014 that comes with Bitcoin mining. If the Bitcoin mining industry is to survive, it needs to reconsider the energy-intensive requirements for keeping the network secure. Bitcoin is now the only major digital currency still using a consensus protocol that forces machines to compete against one another to solve puzzles, consuming as much energy as Sweden does in the process. Ethereum\u2019s move to proof-of-stake slashed its energy usage to a fraction of its former level, despite the fact that Ethereum is a bigger network in terms of on-chain activity. Bitcoin miners might be singing now, but the current relatively good times likely won\u2019t last forever.\n\n2. Who helped post SBF\u2019s bail?\n\nImage: FTX founder and former Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried is facing mounting legal challenges nine months out from his trial date. Getty Images/Canva\n\nBy the numbers: Sam Bankman-Fried \u2014 over 5,000% increase in Google search volume.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of the now-bankrupt FTX crypto exchange, is now accused by U.S. federal prosecutors of tampering with a witness in the criminal fraud case against him, potentially bringing new bail restrictions.\n\nIn a letter to U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, prosecutors alleged that Bankman-Fried had been communicating with the current general counsel for FTX US, who may be a witness at trial, through encrypted messaging app Signal and via email, suggesting \u201can effort to influence\u201d the witness\u2019s potential testimony.\n\nThe prosecutors urged the judge to impose new restrictions on Bankman-Fried to prevent him from contacting any current or former employees of FTX and its trading arm, Alameda Research, and bar him from using \u201cany encrypted or ephemeral call or messaging application.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s lawyer, Mark Cohen, dismissed the prosecutors\u2019 allegation, saying that his client\u2019s communication with the witness on Signal was \u201cmerely an innocuous attempt to offer assistance in FTX\u2019s bankruptcy process,\u201d and he sought to remove a bail condition that denies Bankman-Fried access to FTX or Alameda assets or cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis week, Judge Kaplan also signaled he may reveal the identities of two benefactors who helped Bankman-Fried post his US$250 million bond, which has allowed him to be confined to his parents\u2019 home in California rather than sit in jail. Two of Bankman-Fried\u2019s four bail surety backers have been identified as his parents, but there are two others whose identities are currently unknown to the public.\n\nBankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to eight criminal charges, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, related to the implosion of FTX, and his first trial is currently scheduled to begin in October.\n\nIn another court filing, lawyers for FTX and its debtors said certain insiders at the company were not providing information \u201ccritical to the debtors\u2019 and committee\u2019s recovery efforts,\u201d and asked for authorization to issue subpoenas, including to Bankman-Fried, his parents, his brother, and several of the company\u2019s former top executives.\n\nLast week, FTX released a complete list of its creditors. The 115-page document named not only Web3 companies such as Coinbase, Yuga Labs and Chainalysis but also entities in a wide range of industries, including tech giants Apple, Meta, Google and Amazon. FTX\u2019s creditors also include media companies New York Times and Wall Street Journal, which asked the court to unveil Bankman-Fried\u2019s bail sponsors as a matter of \u201cpublic interest.\u201d\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Bankman-Fried\u2019s relative liberty since his arrest has, reasonably enough, allowed the former FTX chief plenty of time as well as access to digital communications to protest his innocence. While under house arrest at his parents\u2019 home in California, Bankman-Fried has set up his own Substack page and has used his 1.1 million-strong following on Twitter to highlight what he describes as flaws in the prosecution against him. The latest allegation that he has been trying to influence a potential witness is another example of the challenge law enforcement faces when it comes to running multiple cases against a sophisticated accused party fighting the charges against him. While FTX\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings are under way, there also are civil actions by both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. These come in addition to the criminal case brought against Bankman-Fried, who has pleaded not guilty. Bankman-Fried has asserted he\u2019s innocent as prosecutors build a growing case against him. His freedom to do so and to try to sway public opinion in his favor is guaranteed under the rules of due process, no matter how unpalatable some may find the extent to which he is exercising those freedoms. Time will tell whether his efforts to shape the narrative regarding his criminal culpability extend to improper interference in legal processes \u2014 and whether the court of public opinion has any bearing on the court of law that will ultimately decide his fate.\n\n3. Image matters\n\nChinese social media app Xiaohongshu now allows its users to showcase their \u2018digital collectibles\u2019 on their profile pages. Image: Image: Xiaohongshu/Conflux\n\nA Chinese social media application and e-commerce platform that is widely described as the Chinese equivalent of Instagram has integrated layer-1 public blockchain Conflux Network, allowing users to showcase non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on their profile pages, according to Conflux.\n\nConflux said that more than 200 million active monthly users on Xiaohongshu, or \u201cLittle Red Book,\u201d which takes its name from a collection of Chinese former leader Mao Zedong\u2019s quotes and writings, can present NFTs minted on Conflux on its digital collectibles section R-Space.\n\nR-Space went online in November 2021, allowing users with real-name accounts to buy and display digital collectibles created by artists on Xiaohongshu and give them out as gifts. The platform does not allow trading between owners of \u201cdigital collectibles\u201d \u2014 a euphemism in China for NFTs.\n\nSince imposing a strict mining and trading ban on cryptocurrencies in 2021, China has stayed mum when it comes to issuing rules on NFTs, the trading in which state-backed media outlets have frequently criticized. Chinese firms have taken to using the term \u201cdigital collectible\u201d to avoid inviting further government ire.\n\nThe Chinese province of Hainan recently announced that it would step up its oversight of digital collectibles, including cracking down on fraud and copyright infringements, censoring on-chain artwork, and curbing financial risks related to trading in digital collectibles.\n\nDespite there being no shortage of rhetoric against NFT speculation, the China Digital Asset Trading Platform, the country\u2019s first state-backed and regulated secondary market for digital collectibles, was supposed to have launched in January 2023, although its website was still displaying the message \u201ccoming soon\u201d on Feb. 1.\n\nSingapore-registered Conflux has gained government endorsements in some parts of China, where it has collaborated with brands such as McDonald\u2019s."

        "title": "Bitcoin's New $337 Billion Market Opportunity Is in... Arizona? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "At the end of January, the Arizona legislature introduced a new bill to make Bitcoin (BTC 1.45%) legal tender within the state. If the bill passes into law, Arizona will become the first U.S. state where Bitcoin has the status of legal tender.\n\nThe move -- while it might appear quixotic to many crypto skeptics -- is actually similar to the one made by El Salvador back in September 2021, when it became the first nation in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender. Since then, the government of El Salvador, led by President Nayib Bukele, has become one of the staunchest supporters of Bitcoin on the world stage. So it's only natural to ask: What would be the implications of Arizona actually making Bitcoin legal tender?\n\nThe Arizona Bitcoin bill\n\nThe new Arizona bill formally states that Bitcoin can serve as a medium of exchange for \"the payment of debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.\" It would also require merchants to accept Bitcoin as payment for all commercial transactions. In essence, holding $20 worth of Bitcoin in your digital blockchain wallet would become the same as holding a physical $20 bill in your real-world leather wallet.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin is already legal within the United States, but the Arizona Bitcoin bill would add a whole new dimension. It would impact every business within Arizona, which had a state GDP of $337.42 billion in 2021. That's more than 10 times the size of El Salvador's national GDP. Moreover, the Arizona legislature also introduced a bill that would make cryptocurrency tax-exempt property. In other words, the state government couldn't tax you on your crypto holdings. If you're expecting Bitcoin to skyrocket to the moon, that's a big deal.\n\nBut does this Arizona bill actually have any chance of passing? On the surface, it would look highly unlikely. For one, the politician behind the Bitcoin push, state senator Wendy Rogers, attempted to pass this bill in 2022, and it failed on its second reading. Wendy Rogers is a highly polarizing figure within the world of Arizona politics, so she might have trouble getting true bipartisan support for the bill. And secondly, some legal experts say that the Bitcoin bill could be illegal under the \"contract clause\" of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits states from issuing their own money. So, even if the bill passes, it might get tied up in the courts for a long time.\n\nPotential impact\n\nHowever, Bitcoin bulls can certainly dream. In El Salvador, for example, the decision to make Bitcoin legal tender has had some notably positive effects. For one, Bitcoin has made it much easier for El Salvadorans living outside of the country to send remittances back home. This is important because El Salvador is one of the leading nations in the world when it comes to remittances. Bitcoin has also sparked a surge in \"crypto tourism\" for the country. One small beach town -- known as Bitcoin Beach -- has even been featured by CBS News' 60 Minutes. Based on that success, there are now plans to build a Bitcoin City in the country.\n\nSo, if you extend this example to Arizona, the new Bitcoin bill would certainly have an impact on migrants entering the state for work, given that Arizona shares a 370-mile border with Mexico. It would make it much easier for these migrants, who are most likely unbanked, to transmit remittances back home. And it might spark a crypto tourism boom for cities like Phoenix. Instead of Bitcoin Beach, Arizona would be able to promote Bitcoin Desert. Come visit the Grand Canyon, and then spend your Bitcoin in Phoenix!\n\nThere's another possible economic impact here, and that's the possibility of turning Arizona into a crypto hub. Tech entrepreneurs from Southern California might be tempted to relocate to Arizona, just as tech entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are now relocating to Texas. Add in the fact that Arizona is trying to make crypto tax-exempt property, and you can immediately see how Arizona might become an attractive locale for anyone who believes in the future of crypto.\n\nThe global allure of Bitcoin\n\nAt some point, Arizona might turn into a real $337 billion market opportunity for Bitcoin. That would only happen if everyone within the state started to embrace Bitcoin, of course. And that would likely only happen if there is another great Bitcoin bull market rally in which everyone is getting rich. When El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, that was the situation.\n\nThat being said, even skeptics have to acknowledge that Bitcoin has been gaining legitimacy worldwide of late. In December 2022, for example, Brazil passed a sweeping new Bitcoin bill. The Pacific island nation of Fiji also elected a pro-Bitcoin prime minister. In addition, several Caribbean island nations are now planning to make crypto legal tender.\n\nSo Arizona is not some outlier on the world stage. I'm bullish on Bitcoin long-term, and I'm hopeful that Bitcoin will one day be able to take advantage of Grand Canyon-sized market opportunities like the one in Arizona."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price has been trading above $22,500 for 12 days. Of course, this situation can change even if Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell issues positive statements about the economy in today\u2019s post-FOMC presser.\n\nEven if the decision matches the market consensus, the post-meeting statement should be investors\u2019 primary area of focus. Specific areas to focus on would be clues for the next meeting in March.\n\nTroubling news for the largest stablecoin Tether (USDT) could also cause a meaningful impact after a Celsius bankruptcy examiner report showed that \u201cTether\u2019s exposure eventually grew to over $2 billion\u201d in September 2021. However, it is unclear if iFinex \u2014 Tether\u2019s issuer \u2014 suffered any losses. iFinex chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino denied exposure to Celsius and suggested that the examiner had \u201cmixed up\u201d prepositions in the report.\n\nIs a strong correction in stock market ahead?\n\nLegendary portfolio manager Michael Burry, known for being one of the most vocal critics of the subprime mortgage crisis from 2007 to 2008, posted a short note on Twitter on Feb. 1, suggesting that investors \u201csell.\u201d\n\nWhile the message lacks a supporting thesis, one could conclude that Burry expects a meaningful correction in traditional markets. Considering the 40-day correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 index at 75%, the odds of a BTC price retrace become evident.\n\nConsequently, this week\u2019s $1 billion BTC options expiry on Feb. 3 can go either way because bears can still flip the tables even though the tide currently favors the bulls.\n\nBitcoin bears were caught entirely off-guard\n\nThe open interest for the Feb. 3 options expiry is $1 billion, but the actual figure will be lower since bears were caught by surprise after the 9.6% rally between Jan. 20 and Jan. 21.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for Feb. 3. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe 1.61 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $640 million call (buy) open interest and the $400 million put (sell) options.\n\nIf Bitcoin price remains above $23,000 at 8:00 am UTC on Feb. 3, less than $7 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference occurs because the right to sell Bitcoin at $22,000 or $23,000 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\nRelated: Retail giant Pick n Pay to accept Bitcoin in 1,628 stores across South Africa\n\n$23,000 Bitcoin would give bulls a $180 million profit\n\nBelow are the three most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on Feb.3 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $21,000 and $22,000: 2,700 calls vs. 10,700 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $165 million.\n\n2,700 calls vs. 10,700 puts. The net result favors the put (bear) instruments by $165 million. Between $22,000 and $23,000: 4,400 calls vs. 4,200 puts. The net result is balanced between call and put options.\n\n4,400 calls vs. 4,200 puts. The net result is balanced between call and put options. Between $23,000 and $24,000: 7,800 calls vs. 100 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $180 million.\n\n7,800 calls vs. 100 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $180 million. Between $24,000 and $25,000: 12,400 calls vs. 0 puts. Bulls extend their gains to $300 million.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor example, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price, but unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nIn essence, Bitcoin bears need to push the price below $22,000 on Feb. 3 to flip the tables and secure a $165 million profit. But, for now, bulls are well positioned to profit from the BTC weekly options expiry and use the proceeds to further defend the $23,000 support.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nIndependent developer Udi Wertheimer claims he minted a giant image of what appears to be a bald, bearded wizard donning sunglasses and promoting \u201cmagic internet JPEGs\u201d on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Ordinals protocol.\n\nHis announcements in the Discord channel \u201ctaprootwizards.com\u201d and on Twitter sparked further flames of division between Bitcoin purists and Ordinals proponents. The block that minted the non-fungible token (NFT) was mined by bitcoin mining firm Luxor Technologies, which said it was \u201cthe largest Bitcoin block\u201d ever mined.\n\nLast night, we made history\n\n\n\nThe gatekeepers tried to censor us\n\n\n\nBut we mined the LARGEST BLOCK and LARGEST TRANSACTION IN BITCOIN\u2019S HISTORY\n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to bitcoin full node operators for supporting our efforts and hosting our 4MB NFT for all eternity!\n\n\n\ngm @TaprootWizards \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/uKGG918af8 \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) February 2, 2023\n\nBattle lines were drawn when the Ordinals protocol, which stores non-fungible tokens on Bitcoin, launched on the dominant blockchain last month. That showdown created two factions \u2013 purists who insist on using bitcoin (BTC) exclusively for payments and Ordinals fans who welcome NFTs, including this \u201cTaproot wizard\u201d sketch that nearly filled an entire 4 megabyte (MB) block, incurred no transaction fees (although a premium off-chain fee was likely paid) and left Bitcoiners of both stripes mystified.\n\nThe image itself is a throwback to an early Bitcoin meme featuring a similar wizard, crudely rendered in MSPaint, inviting all and sundry to \u201cJoin us\u201d on the then-popular r/bitcoin subreddit.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin Community Erupts in Existential Debate Over NFT Project Ordinals\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin transaction blocks are capped at 4MB, while individual transactions are limited to 1MB unless a user directly approaches a miner to process a larger non-standard transaction (like the wizard NFT) that fills an entire block. The image, which was a massive 3.94 MB, had many Bitcoiners asking: Who would go through the trouble of processing this non-standard NFT mint (or \u201cinscription\u201d in Ordinals lingo) and why?\n\nSomeone just minted the Mother Of All Ordinals \ud83e\udd23\n\n\n\n3.96 MB \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/i3kPA6JoZp \u2014 Gigi \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf5\u26a1 (@GuerillaV2) February 1, 2023\n\nEarlier Thursday, Wertheimer tweeted about the Taproot wizard, stating that \u201cwe made history\u201d and linking to the Taproot Wizards Discord channel. The channel contains a Jan. 31 announcement message from Wertheimer alluding to the future minting of the Taproot Wizard.\n\nHe and Luxor CEO Nick Hansen collaborated to ensure the Taproot wizard NFT was included in a block mined by Luxor, according to a Luxor spokesperson.\n\nAmid much online criticism, Luxor Chief Operating Officer Ethan Vera tweeted the company views the Taproot Wizard as \u201cshort term R&D\u201d as it looks to maximize the revenue potential for both the company and its clients.\n\nOur pool is committed to maximising long term revenue for our mining partners. Short term R&D is vital to building and iterating on software and financial products. People like Preston keep missing the nuance here \u2014 Ethan Vera (@ethan_vera) February 2, 2023\n\n\"Luxor's payout method is based on a full-pay-per-share model, meaning miners get paid an equal market rate for their hashrate based on the total value of bitcoin and transaction fees mined in a given timeframe,\" Colin Harper, head of research and content at Luxor, told CoinDesk.\n\n\"Miners are paid the same regardless of how many (or how few) blocks Luxor mines in a given timeframe. As such, any transactions that weren't included in the NFT block would have been included in subsequent blocks and the variance would even out. This block did not affect miner compensation.\"\n\nVeteran Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr, who vehemently opposes having Ordinals on Bitcoin, says he\u2019s developed a rudimentary \u201cspam filter\u201d that screens for inscriptions and prevents them from being relayed through the Bitcoin network. An inscription is when arbitrary content (like text or an image) is added to sequentially numbered satoshis (sats) \u2013 the smallest units in Bitcoin \u2013 to create unique \u201cdigital artifacts.\u201d\n\n#Bitcoin node patch (HACKY, UNTESTED) to filter out \"ord\" spam.\n\nNOT a protocol change or softfork/hardfork, just a harmless (if it works right) spam filter.\n\n(Also a quick hack and NOT suitable for opening a PR to Core - please write a proper fix for that)https://t.co/h3Q1KpNl9M \u2014 @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) February 1, 2023\n\nCritics of Ordinals argue that NFTs will compete with traditional payment transactions by crowding blocks and driving up transaction fees.\n\nCasey Rodarmor, creator of the Ordinals protocol, disagrees but isn\u2019t fazed by Luke\u2019s new invention. In fact, he welcomes it.\n\n\u201cIt filters inscriptions from an individual Core node\u2019s mempool,\u201d Rodarmor told CoinDesk. \u201cI actually told him how to look for inscriptions to filter them.\u201d\n\nUPDATE (Feb. 2, 2023 18:00 UTC): Adds data size of the NFT and a quote from Luxor's head of research and content, Colin Harper.\n\n\n\n"

CryptoQR is now active at all Pick-n-Pay stores across South Africa, including PnP express and clothing shops!

The payment process requires users to scan an item\u2019s QR code through the CryptoQR app and then proceed to the Lightning Wallet to confirm the rate and complete the transaction.\n\nRelated: South African crypto landscape primed for TradFi growth after FSCA ruling\n\nTwitter users shared their experience with using Bitcoin to pay for everyday items at Pick n Pay stores:\n\nThe move came after the country\u2019s financial regulator, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), amended its financial advisory legislation in October to classify crypto assets as financial products, bringing cryptocurrencies under regulation for the first time in South Africa and allowing financial service providers to offer crypto-assets both domestically and internationally.\n\nThe retail chain disclosed plans to roll out crypto payments nationwide in November, after years of piloting the service in selected stores. A first experiment with cryptocurrencies took place in 2017, when the company began accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment in Cape Town, but transaction costs and wait times hindered the process.\n\nDuring its pilot program, Pick n Pay partnered with Electrum and CryptoConvert to enable customers to pay via the Bitcoin Lightning Network, a second layer added to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain that allows off-chain transactions\n\nAmong the African nations, South Africa appears to be making considerable progress in adopting cryptocurrency. South Africa ranks 30th globally in terms of cryptocurrency adoption according to Chainalysis\u2019 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index. It has been estimated that about 10% to 13% of the South African population holds crypto assets."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFor nearly a decade, creators have enlisted sidechain or layer-2 solutions to link digital art to the Bitcoin blockchain. But how this is accomplished\u2014or whether it should even be done\u2014has Crypto Twitter up in arms after new project Ordinals developed a way to add digital items to on-chain Bitcoin transactions.\n\nNFT are blockchain tokens that can serve as a proof of ownership for assets, including digital goods like artwork, videos, music files, and memberships. While blockchains like Ethereum and Solana are synonymous with NFTs and digital collectibles, many Bitcoin developers have sought ways to bring them to the quintessential blockchain.\n\nOne issue hampering the development of NFTs on Bitcoin is the need for smart contracts. In the minting process, NFTs use smart contracts to assign ownership of the digital asset in the NFT. The smart contract updates the ownership when the NFT is bought or sold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin has only limited smart contract support.\n\nTo address this, earlier projects like Counterparty and Stacks developed alternative solutions that use a native token for the contract piece but ultimately settle their transactions back on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nEarlier examples\n\nIn 2014, Counterparty launched the first layer-2 solution for digital assets using the Bitcoin blockchain. Counterparty, which provides the infrastructure for users to create unique tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, saw its XCP token hit an all-time high above $91 in 2018, but it has fallen about 97% since.\n\nAlthough surpassed by Ethereum and other popular NFT chains in recent years, Counterparty still has an active community of supporters\u2014and its assets can be bridged to Ethereum. More importantly, Counterparty is best known as the home for historical assets like Rare Pepes, which still command significant sums on secondary markets. In April 2022, an NFT containing the opening theme to Larry David\u2019s \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d was minted using Counterparty.\n\nLaunched in 2017 as Blockstacks, Stacks (as it\u2019s now known) is a blockchain network that can run smart contracts and rolls up all of its transactions before settling them on Bitcoin. Stacks says it doesn\u2019t use a sidechain or layer-2 model, but founder Muneeb Ali told Decrypt in 2021 that he refers to it as \u201ca layer 1.5\u201d built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe STX token hit a peak above $3 in December 2021, according to CoinGecko, as its NFTs started to attract the Bitcoin faithful, and in February 2022, an NFT collection called Satoshibles launched a cross-bridge to send NFTs to the Ethereum network. Broadly, however, Stacks has not developed an especially active or valuable NFT market.\n\nWhat's Ordinals?\n\nThe most recent example of Bitcoin NFTs is Ordinals, and it takes a different approach. Launched in January, Ordinals aims to add NFT-like assets directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nDesigned by Casey Rodarmor, a former Bitcoin Core contributor, Ordinals enables users to explore, transfer, and receive individual satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin, or 1/100,000,000 of a BTC), which may include data such as videos and images. Adding assets to individual satoshis is called inscription, which is stored in a Bitcoin transaction\u2019s signature.\n\nThe idea of filling Bitcoin blocks with JPEGs and videos\u2014or even playable video games\u2014isn\u2019t sitting well with some in the Bitcoin community who have voiced concerns that putting NFTs directly on the Bitcoin network will drive up transaction costs.\n\nMarginalized peoples in developing countries will have to pay more to run their Bitcoin nodes and send transactions because privileged wealthy whites want to put JPEG drawings on the blockchain as status symbols. Just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. \u2014 Bitcoin is Saving (@BitcoinIsSaving) January 29, 2023\n\nDespite the controversy, Ordinals brings the quest for NFTs on Bitcoin closer than ever, as it does not require a sidechain or layer-2 solution (or similar) or an additional cryptocurrency to work.\n\nBitcoin remains the top cryptocurrency by market cap, but as Ordinals and past examples show, some developers are still trying to use its decentralized network to power new use cases."

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe global crypto market cap is now at $1.09 trillion, up 3.88% over the last day, according to the latest figures from Coinmarketcap.\n\nMeanwhile, BTC tipped slightly over $24,000 for the first time in 2023, reaching $24,161.27 according to Coinmarketcap.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin bulls plan to flip $23K to support by aiming to win this week\u2019s $1B options expiry\n\nThat being said, Powell said they still expect inflation to continue rising in the services sector for some time and to be prepared for \u201congoing rate rises.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see ourselves as having more persistent inflation in that [services] sector, which will take longer to get down, and we have to complete the job. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.\u201d\n\nPowell noted that \u201congoing rate rises\u201d would still be appropriate as the Federal Reserve attempts to bring inflation back to its 2% target level.\n\nIt should be noted that disinflation refers to a slowdown in the rate of increase of general price levels, as opposed to deflation, where the general price level of goods and services decreases."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) bullish surge in January has helped the Nasdaq Crypto Index to register its third-highest monthly gain, with a 38% surge. The cryptocurrency market started the year bullish, defying major bearish market outlooks. Bitcoin and a number of altcoins touched new multi-month highs as inflation cooled off.\n\nNasdaq Crypto Index monthly price chart Source: Google\n\nThe Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI) recorded its third-biggest monthly gain since its inception in February 2021. The crypto asset index was launched by Brazilian asset manager Hashdex in partnership with the Nasdaq stock exchange. The index consists of eight cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), and Stellar (XLM), among a few others.\n\nBTC has the highest weight in the index (69.8%), followed by ETH (27.08%). The other altcoins have a weight of less than 1%. Thus, the subsequent rise of BTC and ETH, which have surged over 35% in the past month, is also reflected in the index. The index weight refers to the share of stocks invested in a particular digital asset.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin bulls must reclaim these 2 levels as 'death cross' still looms\n\nWith a prolonged crypto winter throughout 2022, Bitcoin ended the year at around $16,500, with most altcoins also testing their yearly lows. Many market pundits had warned that the bearish sentiment might continue into the new year owing to the FTX saga unfolding daily. However, the crypto market showed resilience and started the year on a bullish note, registering a double-digit gain for the past month.\n\nOn Feb. 1, the Federal Open Market Committee press briefing announced an interest rate hike of 25 basis points. The United States Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell, suggested that inflation has started to cool off in the world\u2019s largest economy. The Fed raise worked wonders for the crypto market, with BTC briefly touching $24,000 and the crypto market cap rising by 4%."

        "content": "A nine-year-old boy\u2019s efforts show that Bitcoin (BTC) is for everyone and Bitcoin education is for all ages.\n\nHenry, who lives in the United Kingdom, gave a talk on Bitcoin to his classmates in an engaging and funny presentation. Cointelegraph spoke to Henry\u2019s mother, an author and Bitcoin advocate who goes by Decentrasuze on social media, to find out more.\n\nMy son orange pilling Year 5!\n\n\n\nTeacher feedback:\n\n\n\n\u2018It was very informative, engaging and he really knew his subject knowledge well.\u2019#Bitcoin #Education #Environment pic.twitter.com/EVfWEejfVE \u2014 Decentra Suze (@DecentraSuze) January 31, 2023\n\nDecentrasuze, or simply Susie, explained that Henry gave the talk to his classmates to help them learn about a subject that he finds fascinating, probably because his Mum and Dad are infatuated with Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cHenry is surrounded by Bitcoin. His father and I talk about it all the time. There are always Bitcoin podcasts on in the background, and Henry often asks questions like \u2018How does Bitcoin go up and down?\u2019\u201d\n\nA curious and inquisitive child, Henry was \u201cunscrewing his cot at the age of 18 months to see what\u2019s inside,\u201d so naturally, he asks a lot of questions. But whereas kids in Henry\u2019s class had given talks on coding or space, Henry settled on Bitcoin.\n\nSusie explained that the talk was a success: \u201cHe was buzzing when he came out; so so pleased. His classmates enjoyed it because it was funny.\u201d The presentation is a quirky example of Bitcoin\u2019s growing popularity and understanding among younger generations.\n\nHenry\u2019s Bitcoin blinged cat, Molly.\n\nHenry had included a gif of his cat Molly and pictures of himself dressed up as a gangster \u2014 much to his classmates\u2019 amusement \u2014 to demonstrate that Bitcoin is not for criminals.\n\nHowever, was Henry successful in \u201corange pilling\u201d his classmates about Bitcoin? Susie said that when he asked her son how it went, Henry replied:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know. You never really know with kids!\u201d\n\nHenry will be reassured by the efforts of organizations like My First Bitcoin, the El Salvador-based education program for kids, or even the Bitcoin toys, books and games that are available to help children learn about money and Bitcoin.\n\nUnfortunately, despite Henry\u2019s best efforts, his friend Willliam said he might be interested in Dogecoin (DOGE). William joins Elon Musk in supporting the crypto token created for fun but still pumps every time multibillionaire Musk mentions the meme in his tweets.\n\nAs for Henry, he doesn\u2019t have a phone, so he cannot stack sats (save in Bitcoin) just yet. \u201cHis older sister does have a Wallet of Satoshi account, but the only place she can spend sats is at her dad\u2019s osteopath,\u201d Susie joked.\n\nThe osteopathic practice near London, U.K. Source: BTCmapdotorg\n\nThe osteopathic practice is one of the few places that accept Bitcoin in the Chelmsford area, as shown on BTCMap.org. Nonetheless, more and more merchants are joining the network as the U.K. slowly warms up to the decentralized currency.\n\nHenry\u2019s teacher shared encouraging feedback on his presentation, and there\u2019s now some discussion on whether Henry could deliver the Bitcoin talk to the students in the year above as a real test of his skills.\n\nRelated: UK Bitcoin community reacts to incoming CBDC and digital pound rollout\n\nThe teacher even left an encouraging note saying that Decentrasuze should be \u201cvery proud\u201d of her son\u2019s activities. Judging by the Bitcoin community\u2019s reaction on Twitter, they are too."

        "content": "Only days after the launch of the Bitcoin (BTC)-based Ordinals protocol, its creator had to deal with their first shock pornographic image, which has been inscribed into the blockchain.\n\nOn Feb. 2 at around 12:15 am UTC, an unsavory image known as \u201cgoatse\u201d was inscribed onto the Bitcoin blockchain via the Ordinals protocol.\n\nIt featured on inscription 668 and was live on the Ordinals\u2019 front page for roughly half an hour before the image was removed. It still exists on the blockchain but is not able to be viewed using the Ordinals website.\n\nOrdinals creator Casey Rodarmor told Cointelegraph he acted quickly to remove the image from the Ordinals website but admitted there isn\u2019t much that can be done to stop future instances given the nature of the protocol.\n\nHe is at least working on a solution to stop the images appearing on the Ordinals website.\n\nThe image, known as \u201cgoatse,\u201d depicts a man manipulating his anus. Due to its shock value, it\u2019s often used to trick internet users.\n\nRodamor said for the moment, that there was no way to hide certain inscriptions on the Ordinals\u2019 website without manual input.\n\n\u201cThe explorer has a config file that can be used to hide certain inscriptions, so we decided that was not very pleasant to look at,\u201d he said. \u201cWe added it to that config file and now the server does not return that inscription and will not return that content.\u201d\n\nOrdinals has a simplistic website with every new inscription appearing on its home page.\n\nWhile Rodarmor plans to have a \u201cvery liberal content policy\u201d where people will \u201ccertainly\u201d be able to inscribe pornographic images, he would like to censor them until he finds a way to automatically keep them off the first page, such as creating a separate space for them on the website.\n\nRecent inscriptions on the Ordinals site show users are inscribing images of Pepe the Frog, a cartoon internet meme. Sou: Ordinals\n\nCritics of blockchain technology have concerns that its immutable nature could be used to forever host illegal or grotesque media, while others argue its censorship resistance should be viewed as a key feature.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the criticism Ordinals may receive for censoring certain images, Rodarmor responded:\n\n\u201cThe inscription is still on the chain and if you run your own copy of Ordinal \u2014 which everybody is free to do \u2014 it will not have that config file and you will see the gaping butthole if that is what you so desire.\u201d\n\nHe added his site is just one instance of the block explorer and hopes others create more where they can \u201cimplement their own moderation policies according to their tastes.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018WTH did I just witness?' Magic Eden turns porno after hosting service hacked\n\nRodarmor said it\u2019s only the second time he\u2019s censored a pornographic image. He believes the technical difficulty and cost of inscribing an image onto the BTC network have reduced the instances of such trolling attempts.\n\nOrdinals launched on Jan. 21 and immediately divided the crypto community with arguments on whether it was good for the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nThe protocol works by inscribing satoshis \u2014 the native currency of the Bitcoin network \u2014 with content such as images to make NFT-like structures that can be transferred.\n\nThe cost of inscribing a satoshi can cost tens of dollars in comparison to a regular network transaction that ranges from a few cents to a few dollars."

Discover SCENE\n\nWhat do eggplant emojis, porn, and video games have in common? They\u2019re all now permanently inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThis is probably not what Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind, but thanks to the Taproot upgrade and the controversial Ordinals project\u2014which lets people store unique assets on it, akin to NFTs\u2014you can now play an unofficial clone of the iconic 1993 first-person shooter Doom on the blockchain.\n\nCreated by Nicholas Carlini, the game is inscribed on Bitcoin as Inscription 466 and can be played with a keyboard and mouse. It\u2019s a simplistic knockoff of Doom and doesn\u2019t pack the gory, pixelated punch of the influential original, but it offers a taste of what\u2019s possible through Ordinals. An enhanced version has since been inscribed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd just like that a new version of DOOM with improved gameplay has dropped on the BTC blockchain.https://t.co/1nGRo5krYR h/t @grandfreud https://t.co/6jVqCUrFIG \u2014 Hector Lopez (@hlopez_) February 2, 2023\n\nIt also adds a new layer to the ever-expanding \u201cIt Runs Doom\u201d meme, in which people try to get the game working on nearly any gadget or device they can find\u2014whether it\u2019s an ATM, a fridge, a smartwatch, and plenty more. There\u2019s even a subreddit devoted to the pursuit, followed by over 94,000 Reddit users.\n\nSo does Bitcoin run Doom? For now, the answer is: sort of.\n\nBitcoin is the original decentralized and permissionless blockchain\u2014and the ability to store content on it makes it something of a unique historical record.\n\nThe Ordinal Theory Handbook argues that Bitcoin inscriptions like the Doom clone game are better than NFTs, which are unique blockchain tokens (typically ERC-721 tokens on Ethereum) that signify ownership over associated metadata that in many cases is stored off-chain in a centralized manner.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEvery inscription on Bitcoin through Ordinals is labeled a \u201cdigital artifact,\u201d because it is complete and decentralized in and of itself. It\u2019s immutable, unlike most NFTs, whose metadata can be modified or even deleted by the creator.\n\nSince its launch in January, Ordinals has already caused quite the stir among the Bitcoin community, as maximalists and devotees have debated whether any content should be uploaded to Bitcoin at all.\n\nAs one might expect from the crypto \u201cdegen\u201d community, much of what has been added to Bitcoin as inscriptions so far is something akin to digital graffiti. There are eggplant emojis and Bored Ape Yacht Club knockoffs, along with nudity, music, tweets, GIFs, Donald Trump memes, and even ads for the privacy chain Monero. Fun times."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency community has ridiculed well-known Bitcoin (BTC) critic Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, for calling the United States to follow in the footsteps of China and ban crypto.\n\nIn an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal, the 99-year-old investment veteran has once again slammed crypto, calling a cryptocurrency a \u201cgambling contract with a nearly 100% edge for the house.\u201d\n\nMunger also said that a cryptocurrency is \u201cnot a currency, not a commodity, and not a security,\u201d adding that \u201cobviously\u201d the U.S. should enact a new federal law that would ban crypto.\n\nAccording to Munger, the best way to approach crypto is to follow the example of China, which put a blanket ban on crypto in September 2021. The Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman stated:\n\n\u201cWhat should the U.S. do after a ban of cryptocurrencies is in place? Well, one more action might make sense: Thank the Chinese communist leader for his splendid example of uncommon sense.\u201d\n\nThe community was quick to react to Munger\u2019s latest anti-crypto arguments, with many expressing bewilderment about how measures like China\u2019s crypto ban stack up with the United States\u2019 proclamations that it supports freedom.\n\n\u201cThe battle lines are being drawn. Freedom or tyranny. Non-custodial wallets are the hill we can\u2019t surrender,\u201d NFT APE author Adam McBride wrote on Twitter.\n\nOthers also mocked Munger for not understanding that crypto is virtually unbannable. Indeed, even after \u201cbanning\u201d crypto in 2021, China has continued to be the second-largest Bitcoin miner in the world, and possessing crypto is apparently still legal. Moreover, the idea of lifting the crypto ban has been floating around in China for a while.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that Charlie munger believes he\u2019s doing something by calling for a ban. Doesn\u2019t understand it\u2019s math and can\u2019t be banned. Old age deteriorates critical thinking skills. \u2014 941 (@level941) February 2, 2023\n\nGiven that Munger called cryptocurrency a \u201cgambling contract,\u201d it\u2019s worth noting that gambling is legal under U.S. federal law, despite people losing significant money from it.\n\nRelated: EU lawmakers vote for more restrictive capital requirements on banks holding crypto\n\nAccording to data from the American Gaming Association, U.S. casinos and mobile gaming apps hit a record $54.93 billion in revenue during the first 11 months of 2022. The revenues came at the cost of Americans losing more money on gambling than ever before by the first quarter of 2022.\n\nMany European countries also allow at least some gambling, with about 420,000 British gamblers losing more than $2,000 per year.\n\nDespite casinos causing significant losses for investors, Europe and the U.S. have not followed in the footsteps of China, which banned most forms of gambling back in 1949."

        "content": "The idea of lifting the cryptocurrency ban has started floating in China as a former central bank official has called the country to review its stringent crypto restrictions.\n\nHuang Yiping, a former member of the Monetary Policy Committee at the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC), believes that the Chinese government should think again about whether the ban on cryptocurrency trading is sustainable in the long run.\n\nHuang voiced his concerns about the future of fintech in China in a speech in December, according to a transcript published by the local financial website Sina Finance on Jan. 29.\n\nThe former official argued that a permanent ban on crypto could result in many missed opportunities for the formal financial system, including those related to blockchain and tokenization. Crypto-related technologies are \u201cvery valuable\u201d to regulated financial systems, he stated, adding:\n\n\u201cBanning cryptocurrencies may be practical in the short term, but whether it is sustainable in the long run deserves an in-depth analysis,\u201d Huang stated. He also highlighted the importance of developing a proper regulatory framework for crypto, though admitting that it won\u2019t be an easy task. Huang said:\n\n\u201cThere is no particularly good way to ensure stability and function as to how cryptocurrencies should be regulated, especially for a developing country, but ultimately an effective approach may still need to be found.\u201d\n\nDespite calling for an in-depth analysis of the potential long-term benefits of crypto for China, Huang still emphasized that there are many risks associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). Huang argued that Bitcoin is more like a digital asset rather than a currency because it lacks intrinsic value. Echoing a common anti-crypto narrative, he also claimed that a significant share of Bitcoin transactions is related to illegal transactions.\n\nHuang, now an economics professor at Peking University\u2019s National School of Development, also admitted that China\u2019s central bank digital currency has failed to reach wide adoption despite being launched many years ago. He added that allowing private institutions to issue stablecoins based on the digital yuan remains a \u201cvery sensitive\u201d question, but the pros and cons are worth considering.\n\nRelated: Over 1,400 Chinese firms operating in blockchain industry, national whitepaper shows\n\nChina has been long known for its \u201cblockchain, not Bitcoin\u201d stance, with Chinese President Xi Jinping calling for the country to accelerate the adoption of blockchain as a core for innovation in 2019. At the same time, the Chinese government has shown some hostility to crypto, eventually banning virtually all crypto transactions in 2021.\n\nDespite the ban, China has continued to be the second largest Bitcoin miner in the world as of January 2022, hinting at a large crypto community still existing in the country. According to official data, mainland China customers accounted for 8% of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX despite the country\u2019s ban on crypto trading.\n\nSome local crypto enthusiasts even believe that China has never really banned individuals from possessing or trading crypto."

Please don\u2019t get poorer. At least buy one silver coin. Only $30 and start to get richer.\u201d\n\nKiyosaki tells his 2.89 million Youtube subscribers of his Rich Dad Radio Show that the US dollar stopped being real money back in 1971 when US President Richard Nixon ended the dollar\u2019s peg to gold.\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re going to be talking about the hottest subject on the market today, and it\u2019s not real estate.

        "content": "On Wednesday, the crypto market received favorable news in form of the FOMC announcement and the price of Bitcoin eventually broke above $24,000. With the Fed turning dovish after being hawkish all through 2022, it has been a beacon for the crypto market to rally and the liquidations have ramped up as the market took advantage of this.\n\nCrypto Market Liquidations Cross $130 Million\n\nWith bitcoin\u2019s rally above $24,000, short traders have once again drawn the short stick and are getting brutalized in the market. As of Thursday morning, the volume of liquidations over the last 24 hours has quickly crossed $130 million.\n\nOver 47,000 traders have seen their positions liquidated with the market rally and as expected, the vast majority of these have been short traders. Data from Coinglass shows that 72.96% of all traders affected during this liquidation event were short traders.\n\nFurthermore, almost half of all liquidations took place on the Binance crypto exchange at 48.34%, while Bybit accounted for 19.37%, and OKX followed closely behind at 14.96%. Interestingly, the largest single liquidation took place on the Bybit exchange on the BTCUSD pair worth $1.69 million.\n\nLiquidations cross $130 million | Source: Coinglass\n\nBitcoin leads the pack with over 1,670 BTC liquidated worth $39.67 million. Ethereum saw 20,560 ETH liquidated with $34.31 million, as the price of ETH rocketed past $1,660. Aptos, Solana, and Optimism made the top 5 with liquidations of $6.10 million, $4.05 million, and $2.95 million, respectively.\n\nIn the last four hours though, there seems to be a turn in the trend with bitcoin\u2019s drop below $24,000. While short traders are still suffering the majority of liquidations (58.14%), long positions are catching up.\n\nWhat Happens If Bitcoin Keeps Growing?\n\nBitcoin has since retraced after climbing above $24,000 but the digital asset still maintains its bullish streak. This means that there is still a long runway for bitcoin and it could possibly climb back above $24,000 before the trading day is over.\n\nIf this happens, then the liquidations are expected to ramp up quickly. BTC\u2019s consolidation over the last few days had worked to sow doubt in the market, and short positions were opened during this time. The Fed\u2019s decision to only raise interest rates by 25 basis points has already instilled more trust in investors who are now more willing to take risks.\n\nBTC trending above $23,800 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nPresently, with BTC ranging above its 200-day moving average, $25,000 is more likely a point for the digital asset to end its rally before a major pullback.\n\nAt the time of this writing, bitcoin is still changing hands just below $24,000 at $23,800. Nevertheless, the digital asset is seeing gains of 3.39% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Coinmarketcap.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from Bitcoinist, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Is Bitcoin SV More Efficient Than Bitcoin? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Efficiency has been a heavily-discussed topic in the blockchain space for some time. BSV promotes several elements which enable efficiency within the platform. BTC on the other hand, is enhanced by layer-2 applications which operate atop the network.\n\nPayment transactions on BTC have been enabled by the Lightning Network (LN). LN enhances Bitcoin through micropayments and by allowing instant transactions at low costs and across blockchains. It should also be noted that there have been inconsistencies and defects identified with the platform according to some reports, one of the most recent by researchers at the University of Illinois in a paper published in August 2022.\n\nBitcoin SV and BTC have long been compared. BTC, represents the largest blockchain and digital asset ecosystem in the world. On the other hand, BSV states its claim as being the original Bitcoin network which preserves the vision and mission of Satioshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat Makes A Blockchain Efficient?\n\nWith so much emphasis on Proof-of-stake (PoS) versus Proof-of-work (PoW) in the ongoing blockchain consensus algorithm debate, it is quite easy to mistakenly consider efficiency as being affected by network mining standards. The fact is, efficiency is more related to the ability of the network to process transactions in an efficient manner, not the standard.\n\nWhile the mining standard does affect the carbon footprint of the network based on the energy utilised in the process, network efficiency hangs upon entirely different metrics.\n\nHow Does Efficiency Differ Between Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nBoth Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin utilise PoW blockchain consensus mechanisms. In the model, miners join the networks and use powerful computing machines that are leveraged to solve complicated mathematical problems in a race for block rewards. The nature of how transactions are handled and processed in the block generation methodology is what reflects differences between the efficiency of each network.\n\nThe throughput, or power of the Bitcoin SV network is significantly higher, and therefore more efficient, than that of BTC. Bitcoin SV promotes lightning fast, instantaneous blockchain transactions. This is largely supported by larger block sizes enabled on BSV. Transactions on Bitcoin SV are processed with a max, 4 GB block size, compared to BTC, with 1 MB. The block size affects the amount of transactions included in each block. More transactions are able to be grouped in BSV blocks, while only a limited amount can be processed per BTC block.\n\nThe daily average block size for the BSV network is referenced as being between 25-286 MB according to the most recently available metrics, well under its maximum allowable capacity. Comparatively, BTC is noted as being under 1.5 MB for its daily average block size. Each blockchain has a network token associated with its platform. While each holds intrinsic value as tokens to reward miners, power applications and more, like all cryptocurrencies traded on the open market, BTC and BSV price is influenced by trading and associated market factors.\n\nGreater Mining Efficiency After All\n\nAs a bonus, the larger data capacity subsequently means that miners on the BSV network are also more energy-efficient, which again, is a separate measurement altogether. This is because the same power emitted by BSV miners is able to be used in order to process more transactions simply because more network transactions can be added and into each block that is mined on-chain. This enables the referenced fast, instantaneous transactions of the BSV platform.\n\nWhich Network Processes More Transactions?\n\nIn a side-by-side comparison between BSV and BTC, it is made evident that a much larger number of transactions are processed on the BSV blockchain platform than BTC. It is estimated that around 260,000 transactions are processed on the BTC network per day, as compared to around 3.5 million on BSV.\n\nTo demonstrate the differences between the two more plainly, BTC is referenced as having the ability to process around 4.6 transactions per second (tps), versus close to 100,000 transactions per second on the BSV platform. This certainly helps to demonstrate the effect of larger block sizes and how they work to dramatically enhance the efficiency of the BSV blockchain.\n\nWhat About Additional Data Processing?\n\nBSV is noted for being able to enable data in its transactions. Data processing is supported by the presence of Script and Turing code, which empower the implementation of smart contracts within the network scheme. This makes the BSV network ideal not only for fast, instant transaction processing, but also for Bitcoin-enabled applications\n\nBitcoin-enabled applications provide organisations, businesses and individuals the ability to create data-dependent innovations such as decentralized gaming platforms, NFT (non-fungible token) ecosystems, and more. BTC is only able to achieve such functionality with layer-2 applications which are needed to scale the underlying platform.\n\nSummary And Conclusion\n\nEfficiency remains a hot topic in the blockchain industry. Now that the elements which go into network efficiency have been carefully disclosed, it seems BSV greatly outdoes the BTC network in the area of true network efficiency. With immensely larger block sizes that work to enhance transaction capacities and the throughput of the network, BSV presents as a clear example of the type of efficiency sought in today\u2019s ever-increasing blockchain-integrated global business and social environments.\n\nNot only is the efficiency greater, but in the area of blockchain mining, BSV has been measured as using only 765.31 PH/s (Peta Hash per second) of power in its network mining model, compared to BTC\u2019s 136,270 PH/s. While the mining standard does not reflect the efficiency and throughput, the superior throughput of BSV enables such efficiency to be captured in the mining standard as well.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Bitcoin is the King of the crypto market, and around 45% of the money is invested in it. All currencies are dependent on its price as they follow its unique pattern.\n\nAfter a long bear market, things have been picking up a bit of pace as BTC looks to recover. If you got hit badly in the crash, Bitcoin might not be able to surprise your wallet in 2023.\n\nHowever, if you want to get huge returns this year, invest in MEMAG, FGHT, TARO, and CCHG. Don\u2019t get flustered if you see money pouring in after buying these coins.\n\nBitcoin Price Surges through the Roof\n\nThe year 2022 wasn\u2019t for Bitcoin as it saw its price at $16k, the lowest ever in the last four years, plunging from $67k. It was all due to bad news and unexpected crashes that forced traders to pull out their money. But 2023 brought new hopes, as Bitcoin surged to almost 43% of its price from $16,500 to $23,800 in a month.\n\nThis price increase is the revival of BTC after the continuous bear market, as it will help other altcoins to gain momentum. One main reason for the BTC to get a huge pump is the positive CPI report and BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) showing a decline in Inflation.\n\nHowever, the price of BTC has not recovered to the pre-FTX crash point but is on its way to breaching important resistance levels. The market may pump even more if there\u2019s a positive CPI report and a stoppage of interest rate hikes.\n\nWhy Buying Crypto Right now is a good option?\n\nAs the price of BTC is increasing with every passing day, it\u2019s a great opportunity to set foot in the crypto market as it seems to stabilize once again after massive crash reports. If you are quick enough to analyze the situation and get in and out on time, you\u2019ll be able to make a hefty profit from this pump.\n\nSome experts think that BTC might fall under $20k once again, but until then, you can take full benefit of it as almost all the altcoins follow the pattern of BTC, and they might be pumping soon. Also, check out the news, as you\u2019ll find potential tokens releasing new features, and the world would be interested in buying them. Traders who left during the crash are coming back.\n\nPotential Gainers in 2023\n\nExperts say that 2023 will be the year for crypto traders who lost their fortunes in the crash. Let\u2019s briefly look at these four crypto tokens and see what the hype is about.\n\nMeta Masters Guild (MEMAG)\n\nMeta Masters Guild is the first ever Blockchain-based mobile gaming platform. This team\u2019s goal is to make a high-quality ecosystem of Blockchain-powered games that people love. For anyone contributing to the platform will earn rewards in return.\n\nThe games will use a single currency, MEMAG, for all the purchases and rewards.

        "title": "Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Profit Taking Reaches Levels Not Seen Since Nov. 2021 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin short-term holder profit-taking has reached high levels not seen since the November of 2021.\n\nBitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Shot Up Recently\n\nAs pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a near-term top usually becomes more probable when this trend forms for BTC. The relevant indicator here is the \u201cSpent Output Profit Ratio\u201d (SOPR), which tells us whether the average Bitcoin investor is selling at a loss or at a profit right now.\n\nWhen the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the holders as a whole are realizing some profit on their selling currently. On the other hand, values below the threshold suggest the overall market is selling at some loss at the moment.\n\nNaturally, the indicator having a value exactly equal to 1 would suggest the average investor is just breaking even right now as the total amount of profits being realized in the market is equal to the losses currently.\n\nThe SOPR here covers the entire market, but the metric can also be modified to cover only certain segments of the market. One major part of the sector is made up of the \u201cshort-term holders\u201d (STH) which is a cohort that includes all investors that acquired their coins within the last 155 days.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) Bitcoin SOPR specifically for these STHs over the last several years:\n\nThe 30-day MA value of the metric seems to have seen some rise in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin STH SOPR had been below a value of 1 throughout the 2022 bear market, implying that these investors had been selling at a loss during this period.\n\nThe quant has also marked previous instances of such a trend with the green boxes in the BTC price chart. It looks like this trend was also observed during bearish periods of the past cycles.\n\nRecently, with the latest rally, the metric has sharply climbed and broken out of this zone, as its value is above 1 now. This suggests that there is more profit harvesting happening from this cohort than loss realization currently.\n\nThis makes sense as prices right now are significantly higher than they were during the last 155 days window, which is when the STHs would have bought their coins, so these holders must be in some decent profits currently.\n\nAs the rally has continued, the STHs seem to have rapidly ramped up their profit-taking as well, since the SOPR indicator for them has also continued to shoot up. The level of their profit realization is now comparable to that seen in November 2021, when Bitcoin set its all-time high.\n\nAs for what this current profit-taking may imply for BTC, the analyst explains, \u201cwhen retail starts to get euphoric, the probability of a near-term price top starts to increase.\u201d\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $23,800, up 3% in the last week.\n\nLooks like BTC has risen in the past day | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The king of all cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, is trading against USDT on the aforementioned 1-day technical chart. At the time of writing, the price of one bitcoin is $22,987. Since the beginning of 2023, the cryptocurrency has finally risen above its 200-day Moving Average after trading below it for a protracted period. This has sparked speculation about the probable start of a positive trend.\n\nFurthermore, if the 50-day Moving Average also crosses above the 200-day Moving Average and continues to trade higher, it is likely that Bitcoin\u2019s price will experience a significant upward movement from its current level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-Day Technical Analysis (Source: TradingView)\n\nThe initial resistance level on the 1-day chart is also prominently located close to the $25,000 price mark. It is anticipated that the price of Bitcoin will increase to the second resistance level of $32,000 and even higher than resistance 3, the $40,000 price level in 2023 if it is trading close to this resistance level and successfully smashes it.\n\nHowever, the present Relative Strength Index (RSI) value is at 68.17, near the overbought territory of 70. When the RSI reaches the overbought region, it is typical for the digital asset to experience temporary price corrections. In such an event, it is likely that Bitcoin\u2019s price will retrace and find support at its 200-day Moving Average price zone of $19,701.\n\nIn the event that the first support level is breached, will this signify a renewed bearish trend for cryptocurrencies? Will Bitcoin\u2019s price retrace to the low of $16,000, similar to its levels in 2022?\n\nHowever, despite its growth and popularity, Bitcoin remains a highly speculative investment and its value is influenced by a wide range of factors, both internal and external to the cryptocurrency market.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Bitcoin Whales \u2014 large holders of Bitcoin \u2014 have seen a sharp decrease in their annual rate of coin holding over the past few years. They usually hold 1000 or more BTC. However, recent data from StockApps.com shows that the number of whales has dropped by 60% compared to the previous year.\n\nEdith Reads, the financial analyst of StockApps, commented on the data.\n\n\u201cThe drop in whale numbers suggests that they are offloading their coins and could indicate a bear market in Bitcoin. However, this could also mean that whales are cashing out due to a decrease in confidence or for other reasons such as diversifying their portfolios or selling for profit.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Interest Is Still High\n\nNotably, this decline does not mean a decrease in interest or investment in crypto. Many other investors and institutions continue to invest and strongly support the industry. The reduction in the annual rate of coin holding by Bitcoin Whales might reflect an investment strategy.\n\nThe crypto market remains one of the fastest-growing industries, with Bitcoin leading the charge. Its decentralized nature, security, and transparency make it an attractive alternative for investors. As the industry evolves and matures, we expect growth and innovation in the crypto market.\n\nThe decline in the annual rate of coin holding by Bitcoin Whales is not a negative development. Instead, it is a normal and expected part of the investment cycle in the growing crypto market. Moreover, the market continues to show tremendous potential and promise. Thus, making it an exciting time for investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nWhy the Decline?\n\nDespite this decrease, the overall sentiment in the market remains positive. The decline in the annual rate of coin holding by Bitcoin Whales is not uncommon. These large investors often adjust their strategies based on market conditions and investment goals.\n\nThis could be due to various reasons, such as diversifying their portfolio, de-risking, or profiting from the current market conditions. However, it is also possible that some whales are cashing out due to decreased confidence in Bitcoin and other crypto assets.\n\nBesides, there is an increase in institutional investment in Bitcoin. Thus, leading to a decline in the whales\u2019 share of the total supply. Institutional investors tend to buy large amounts of Bitcoin and hold it for long periods rather than selling it quickly.\n\nThe decline in the whales\u2019 rate of coin holding might signify that whales are losing confidence in BTC investment. However, the whales still hold a significant amount of Bitcoin.\n\nStockApps"
