        "content": "Bitcoin gained popularity as one of the first cryptocurrencies to enter the public domain. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that rely on blockchain encryption and lack the backing of any government\u2019s central bank. For this reason, many companies consider bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be somewhat risky to deal with.\n\nBitcoin, ethereum and other popular forms of cryptocurrency have attracted early adopters by offering rapid payments, a greater sense of privacy and the potential for a quick profit. That last point is important to note due to the general volatility of cryptocurrencies compared to the dollar. While there\u2019s a chance that owners will make a fast profit, they could lose money just as easily.\n\nCryptocurrency is appealing to investors who are willing to take major risks, but companies have been hesitant to join the trend. That\u2019s especially true of car dealerships, who have much more money to lose per transaction than the average business if cryptocurrency\u2019s value crashes.\n\nWhy Would Someone Buy a Car With Bitcoin?\n\nWhile cryptocurrency isn\u2019t popular yet among the general public, it has an extremely loyal following. Advocates of bitcoin payments point to the following as some key benefits:\n\nPayments are fast and secure\n\nLow or no transaction fees apply\n\nSensitive financial information remains private\n\nThe elimination of percentage-based transaction fees could potentially save some customers considerable money when making a purchase as large as a car. Yet while the reasons above may appeal to some, it\u2019s still relatively difficult to find dealerships that accept cryptocurrency payments."

        "content": "The native token of crypto exchange Binance, known as BNB, plummeted Tuesday on news the Justice Department is filing criminal charges against the company and its CEO, Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao.\n\nBinance\u2019s cryptocurrency, BNB, fell as much as 9% on the initial news, before narrowing the drop to around 5% by midafternoon. The initial report came from the Wall Street Journal, which said Zhao would soon step down as CEO of the exchange and plead guilty to violating U.S. anti-money-laundering laws. Court documents have since confirmed this.\n\nBinance will also plead guilty to a criminal charge and pay $4.3 billion in fines, which will allow it to settle civil charges brought against it by regulators. Zhao himself will pay $50 million.\n\nAs BNB fell, so did the broader crypto market, with the global cryptocurrency market cap dropping 3.5% over the past day to $1.43 trillion, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, fell just under 2% following news of the charges against Zhao and Binance.\n\nBinance initially sold millions of BNB in 2019, and currently allows customers to use the tokens for a discount on trading. The company and Zhao still hold billions of dollars worth of the coin.\n\nThe Justice Department is scheduled to hold a press conference at 3 p.m. Eastern Time on the criminal charges. The lawsuit follows previous lawsuits by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission."

        "title": "Nonce: What It Means and How It's Used in Blockchain - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is the Nonce?\n\nNonce, a portmanteau of \"number used only once,\" is a random number that bitcoin miners try to find in order to mine a new block in the Bitcoin blockchain and receive a block reward for their efforts. The number is a critical element to the Bitcoin blockchain running smoothly.\n\nThe practice of mining blocks helps record and verify transactions on the Bitcoin ledger and mint new bitcoins to grow the circulating supply. Bitcoin transactions are verified in batches rather than individually, giving rise to the block structure. The block height is the number of all blocks up to a given block.\n\nThe nonce ensures each block has a unique hash, a cryptographic fingerprint that serves as an identifier for the block and underpins the expansion of the blockchain. By adjusting the nonce, miners can modify hash values that in turn potentially solve mathematical problems for mining new blocks.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Bitcoin miners engage in a relentless trial-and-error process to find the correct nonce for the production of a new block, repeatedly hashing the block header with different nonce values until a hash appears that satisfies a mathematical puzzle and the network's requirements.\n\nEach nonce is used only once for a particular block, ensuring each block has a unique identifier to prevent transaction malleability.\n\nFinding valid nonces and hashing consumes significant computational power, contributing to the network's security and resistance to malicious attacks and double-spending.\n\nUnderstanding the Nonce\n\nA Bitcoin nonce is a 32-bit (or 4-byte) random number that miners attempt to figure out through computational brute force so they can generate a valid and unique hash to produce a new block in the Bitcoin blockchain. The nonce is one of the key elements in the Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm and consensus mechanism that validates and secures the Bitcoin network.\n\n\n\nIn Bitcoin mining, miners compete to solve a complex mathematical puzzle by repeatedly hashing a block header, a grouping of data in each block containing the nonce and other essential information about the previous block, the timestamp, transactions included in the new block, and the Merkle root, the hash of all hashes of all transactions in the block.\n\nHashing refers to the process of applying a cryptographic hash function to the block header. The cryptographic hash function is a mathematical operation that takes the block header data and transforms it into a unique hash value, a fixed-length hexadecimal and encrypted string of characters. The block header data is the input and the hash value is the output of the function.\n\nThis hash value serves as a cryptographic fingerprint of the block, ensuring that the block's contents remain unaltered. Miners constantly race to generate hash values that meet the Bitcoin network's mining difficulty requirements, which are programmed to increase at scheduled intervals so the blockchain remains tamper-proof and reliable.\n\n\n\nThe nonce is the only variable in the block header that miners can modify. By changing the nonce, miners can change the hash of the block and calculate different possible solutions to the mathematical puzzle needed to spin up a new block. The first miner to find a valid hash under the network's mining difficulty requirements is awarded the block reward and the right to add the new block to the blockchain.\n\nTo find a valid nonce, miners must repeatedly increment the nonce value and recalculate the hash until the resulting hash value meets the network's target difficulty. In numerical analysis and computational algorithms, incremental computation refers to a method for approximating functions or solving equations using small, consistent steps.\n\nIf the hash value exceeds the network's difficulty-adjusted target hash, the miner tries again with another randomly generated nonce. If the resulting hash value is equal to or less than the target hash, the miner has created a solution and receives the block as a reward. The block is closed, and a new block opens that includes the previous block's hash.\n\nThe target difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a valid nonce. It is adjusted periodically to maintain a consistent block generation rate.\n\n\n\nThe Nonce in Bitcoin Mining Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the nonce is used in Bitcoin mining:\n\nMiners gather transaction data and create a new block header. They initialize the nonce to a random value and start hashing the block header along with the nonce. They repeatedly increment the nonce and rehash the block header until they find a hash that meets the network's difficulty requirements. The first miner to find a valid hash broadcasts the block to the network. Other miners verify the block's validity and add it to their local copies of the blockchain.\n\nSignificance of the Nonce\n\nThe nonce maintains the integrity and security of the Bitcoin blockchain. It prevents attackers from tampering with or forging blocks, as any alteration to the block data, including the nonce, would result in a different hash value, rendering the block invalid.\n\n\n\nIt is highly unlikely that a miner will guess the nonce on the first try. Miners in a PoW system generally have to test a large number of nonce options before getting it right.\n\nThe greater the difficulty\u2014a measure of how hard it is to create a hash less than the target\u2014the longer it is likely to take to generate a solution. And because the difficulty increases, the process of finding a valid nonce is more computationally intensive and requires significant electricity and computing power over time, introducing material constraints.\n\nThis is intentional, as it helps to secure the Bitcoin network by making it computationally infeasible to manipulate the blockchain with coordinated attacks and transaction errors such as 51% attacks and double-spending.\n\nBy requiring miners to find a valid nonce and making it difficult to predict or manipulate the nonce, the PoW algorithm ensures only blocks with a valid history can be added to the blockchain and malicious actors are prevented from changing or duplicating transactions, guaranteeing the immutability of the blockchain.\n\n\n\nThe miner who successfully finds the valid nonce for a new block receives a block reward, which consists of newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees. This reward incentivizes miners to participate in the network's security and contribute to the validation of transactions.\n\nTransactions on a blockchain are aggregated into blocks from a memory pool based on the age of the transaction or the amount of fees paid. A memory pool, also known as a mempool, is a temporary data storage area that holds unconfirmed transactions before they are added to the blockchain. The mempool acts as a waiting room where transactions are queued up and prioritized based on their transaction fees.\n\nNonce and Difficulty\n\nBlock difficulty is kept at the same level across the entire Bitcoin network, meaning all miners have the same chance of figuring out the correct hash. The Bitcoin network is set up to process a specific number of blocks over a period of time and to occasionally adjust the difficulty for miners to validate the blocks.\n\nThe difficulty of finding a valid nonce is dynamically adjusted based on the overall hash rate of the network. If the network's hash rate increases, the difficulty increases, making it harder to find a valid nonce. This mechanism ensures that blocks are generated at a consistent rate, regardless of the number of miners participating.\n\n\n\nIf the number of blocks processed doesn't meet the difficulty target, the difficulty is reduced, determining how much time the process took over the limit. If the network meets it too quickly, the difficulty is increased. When the difficulty is higher, more nonces are generated because more attempts are required to solve the hash.\n\nBitcoin block 813,958, mined on Oct. 26, 2023 by AntPool, a cluster of miners known as a mining pool, had a nonce of 105,983,939. That day, AntPool had a bitcoin hashrate of 123 exa-hashes per second (or 123 quintillion hashes) and the entire Bitcoin network hashed at 428.22 exa-hashes per second (or 428.22 quintillion hashes). That means the AntPool mining pool alone generated quadrillions of numbers to find the correct nonce and winning hash, out of an exponentially many more number of trials for all mining pools combined.\n\nMining pools, rather than individuals, open most blocks because the mining difficulty is so high that a single miner is unlikely to have enough hashing power to keep up. This power is measured in the number of hashes per second. A home computer might have a hash rate of 100 mega-hashes per second (or 100 million hashes). In contrast, a mining farm full of ASIC miners, the most advanced mining technology on the market, might hash around 30 exa-hashes per second (or 30 quintillion hashes).\n\nWhat Is a Blockchain? A blockchain is a distributed ledger or database shared among nodes of a digital network, which can include computers, data centers, and mobile devices. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in a digital format. As a ledger, a blockchain maintains a secure record of transactions, as in cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin. A blockchain's innovation comes from the fidelity of a data record without the need for a trusted third-party.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between a Nonce and a Hash? A nonce is a temporary value used in the process of generating a hash, while a hash is a permanent identifier for a block. A nonce is 32 bits long, while a hash is 256 bits long. A nonce is used only once for a particular block, while a hash is unique to the block header and cannot be reversed to obtain the original data. Nonces are used to make it difficult to generate valid hashes, which helps to secure the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHow Much Do Miners Make From Block Rewards? The block reward for miners who successfully find a valid nonce for a block in Bitcoin consists of two components: newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees. The amount of newly minted Bitcoin in the block reward has been roughly 6.3 BTC since June 2021 and halves every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years, with the next due in April 2024. This halving mechanism is called the \"Bitcoin halving\" and is designed to gradually reduce the overall supply of Bitcoin and maintain its value. The amount of transaction fees in the block reward varies depending on the overall volume and fee rates of transactions. In recent years, transaction fees have become a significant portion of miners' income, often exceeding the value of the newly minted Bitcoin in the block reward. This is due to the increasing popularity and usage of Bitcoin, leading to a higher volume of transactions and higher transaction fees.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn Bitcoin mining, miners are constantly trying to find a nonce that will produce a hash that meets the network's difficulty requirements for spawning new blocks that validate recent transactions and issue fresh bitcoin. A hash is a unique identifier for each block in the Bitcoin blockchain and a fixed-length string of characters that is generated by applying a cryptographic hash function to a piece of data in a process known as hashing. The data that is hashed is the block header, a structured element containing information about the block. Once a valid nonce is found, it is discarded and never used again."

        "content": "Daily Email Feature Anticipation Rises for Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval\n\nETC Group said institutional investors are increasingly attracted to its physically backed crypto exchange-traded product as it has achieved a three-year track record, and as anticipation increases for the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US.\n\nThe European fund manager of digital asset-backed securities launched BTCE, the world\u2019s first centrally cleared bitcoin exchange-traded product, on Deutsche B\u00f6rse XETRA in June 2020. BTCE is the largest physically backed crypto ETP in Europe with assets under management of more than $625m and is also Europe\u2019s most heavily traded crypto ETP according to ETC Group.\n\nBradley Duke, founder and chief strategy officer at ETC Group, told Markets Media that the enthusiasm for bitcoin has certainly returned.\n\n\u201cI think that has a lot to do with the imminent approval of an ETF in the US,\u201d he added.\n\nCCData, the crypto research and data provider, agreed in a report that crypto market has been sensitive to ETF-related news, particularly after recent court rulings that have challenged the SEC\u2019s rejections of spot crypto ETF applications, fuelling optimism for future approvals.\n\n\u201cThe anticipation surrounding spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly BlackRock\u2019s proposal, is starting to have a direct impact on the market,\u201d said CCData.\n\nThe report continued that rumours surrounding the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs have also led to significant growth of trading volumes on institutional crypto exchanges, such as LMAX and Cboe (ErisX), recording increases of 36.2% and 127.2% since September.\n\nDuke explained that ETC listed ETPs because the European Union does not allow a Bitcoin ETF, due to concentration rules. BTCE listed more than three years ago and Duke said one of the lessons learnt is the importance of on-exchange liquidity, as daily trading volumes are between five to 10 times higher than the next competitor.\n\n\u201cThe biggest surprise is that the institutional investor isn\u2019t really there yet in Europe,\u201d he added. \u201cThe significance of the approval of a bitcoin spot ETF in the US, especially from firms such as BlackRock, is that it will signal that the market is right for institutional investors.\u201d\n\nDuke continued that BTCE now has a track record of more than three years of daily volumes and performance, which is important for institutional investors.\n\n\u201cAs a company we have around $1bn in assets under management and one thing we have learnt is that structure really matters,\u201d he added. \u201cInvestors will gravitate towards the ones that feel more secure and offer greater transparency.\u201d\n\nETC Group said in a statement that BTCE holds a record amount of 25,863 bitcoins and the firm\u2019s total assets under management have surpassed $1bn for the first time since April 2022.\n\nTim Bevan, founder and chief executive at ETC Group, said in a statement: \u201cSeeing BTCE reach record BTC holdings and our total AUM surpass the $1bn mark for the first time in over 18 months is a clear signal that this bear market is behind us. This new cycle will be the one where institutions truly begin to participate globally and our ability to capture almost 50% of all crypto ETP fund inflows in Europe year to date is a testament to the quality of our products.\u201d\n\nIndex tracking products\n\nIn April this year ETC Group announced the listing of DA20, an exchange-traded product that tracks the performance of the MSCI Global Digital Assets Top 20 Capped Index on Deutsche B\u00f6rse Xetra. The product was also listed on the Swiss stock exchange, BX Swiss, in October.\n\nDuke said this is the only crypto ETP based on an MSCI index. The product was built with institutions in mind and allows investors to get a broad exposure to the crypto market, with a quarterly rebalance. The MSCI index tracks the top 20 investable digital assets comprising approximately 85% of the crypto market.\n\n\u201cA suite of index products is definitely on our longer term product roadmap,\u201d added Duke. \u201cThe tide has been moving towards more investment management type products.\u201d\n\nChristopher Day, founder of Days Global Advisors, said his firm has invested in Grayscale Investments\u2019 bitcoin trust in the US and he would also love to invest in an index-based crypto product.\n\nGrayscale Investments, the US digital currency asset manager, won a court case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission after the regulator denied the conversion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an ETF, despite the SEC approving bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\nThe court ruling said the SEC failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of bitcoin futures ETFs but not Grayscale\u2019s proposed conversion. The court said: \u201cIn the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has to review the Grayscale application again, but market participants have said the ruling is a very promising development for Grayscale, and the numerous spot Bitcoin ETF applications that are pending.\n\nDay said that converting the trust to an ETF means the fund will be more transparent and more liquid, and make it easier for asset managers to allocate to crypto in a dynamic way. He believes that Grayscale has opened the door to the approval of bitcoin ETF applications by winning its case, which will likely lead to more institutional flows into crypto.\n\n\u201cI think index funds would be the next evolution in crypto and then active ETFs,\u201d Day added. \u201cThe roadmap is laid out.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price action shows consolidation and significant volatility, focusing on the $38,000 resistance level and market sentiment indicators. How high can Bitcoin go?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has shown resilience and bounced back above $37k levels after declining to $35k levels on Nov. 15.\n\nBTC has maintained its bullish outlook despite a period of sliding prices influenced by the absence of significant developments in the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and other macroeconomic factors.\n\nMoreover, over the past few weeks, Bitcoin\u2019s journey has been marked by a pattern of higher lows and higher highs, a characteristic of a bull phase in the crypto market.\n\nGreg Moritz of AltTab Capital remarks on the natural occurrence of pullbacks even in bullish markets, suggesting that the current scenario is a typical fluctuation within an overall positive trend\u200b\u200b.\n\nFurther bolstering Bitcoin\u2019s position is the macroeconomic landscape, which presents interesting dynamics for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s policy adjustments in response to economic indicators and endorsements by financial institutions like BlackRock have contributed to a resurgence in crypto, reflecting a cautiously optimistic market sentiment\u200b\u200b.\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s current state within a rapidly evolving financial ecosystem, let\u2019s see what factors are affecting BTC price and what\u2019s the Bitcoin price prediction for the coming days.\n\nUpdated status and market expectations for spot BTC ETF\n\nThe SEC\u2019s cautious stance on the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs remains evident, as seen by the fact that, to date, no applications for these ETFs, including a notable submission from Global X, have been approved.\n\nThis consistent hesitance from the regulatory body has effectively narrowed the window for approving multiple ETFs, pushing the potential for a first spot Bitcoin ETF approval into 2024.\n\nAttention is now turning towards the Jan. 10, 2024, deadline for the ARK 21Shares application, which stands as a significant date for investors and analysts monitoring the situation.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s ongoing reluctance to approve spot BTC ETFs, even amidst growing interest in integrating cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial sector, underscores the enduring regulatory hurdles within the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin price action and technical analysis\n\nAs of Nov. 21, Bitcoin\u2019s price action has been fluctuating around the $37,000 mark, displaying the challenges it faces in reclaiming higher ground as a stable support level\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is well below Bitcoin\u2019s current price at about $36,900, indicating a bullish state in the market. Bitcoin\u2019s price movement is currently confined within a sideways channel, fluctuating between $36k and $38k level.\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin bulls and bears are engaged in a tug of war near the $36,400 support/resistance level, which has become a critical midpoint of the trading range for BTC. This pattern emerged after Bitcoin first spiked to $38,000 on Nov. 9, indicating a consolidation phase in its price movement\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe market also witnessed significant volatility, with a noticeable drop to the $34,750 level, signaling a cooling trend. However, a strong rally was observed on Nov. 16, with Bitcoin surging to a high of $38,000, mirroring its peak. This repeated peak forms a double top, suggesting $38,000 as a strong resistance level\u200b\u200b.\n\nMeanwhile, the crypto fear and greed index is currently at 74 out of 100 points, indicating an elevated level of optimism within the cryptocurrency sector. The index experienced a drop from a weekly high of 77 achieved on Nov. 16, which denoted even more greed.\n\nThe fear and greed index is a crucial indicator of market sentiment, often used to gauge the emotional state of the crypto markets\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price prediction\n\nDigitalCoinPrice anticipates an optimistic Bitcoin price forecast for the coming years. Their BTC forecast for 2023 suggests a significant rise in Bitcoin\u2019s value, estimating it to reach around $74,086.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, the BTC price prediction by DigitalCoinPrice becomes even more promising, with an expectation of Bitcoin\u2019s price climbing to approximately $90,228.\n\nOn the other hand, CoinCodex offers a near-term Bitcoin price prediction that is a bit more conservative.\n\nAs per their forecast, by Nov. 29, Bitcoin is anticipated to be valued at about $54,343. This BTC price prediction, while lower than DigitalCoinPrice\u2019s, still reflects a positive outlook for Bitcoin in the short term.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to approach these Bitcoin price predictions with caution, keeping in mind the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nRemember, investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin should always be done judiciously, never exceeding what one can afford to lose.\n\nRead more: Why Bitcoin price predictions often miss the mark\n\nDisclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nThe US government just sent a clear message to the world of cryptocurrency, a market valued at around $1.4 trillion.\n\nJust as crypto investors were hoping to move on from the historic conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder and former CEO of the collapsed FTX crypto exchange, US officials displayed yet another show of force against criminal activity surrounding crypto.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, pled guilty on Tuesday to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program, potentially allowing bad actors of all kinds to use the platform to move money.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the largest penalty ever imposed on a money services business in United States history, which just so happens to be a crypto firm:\n\nIt\u2019s going to take even more time for the crypto industry to wipe away its tainted image\n\nZhao and Bankman-Fried were largely seen as the faces of the crypto industry. Now his guilty plea, along with Bankman-Fried\u2019s conviction, means that good actors in the crypto industry will have to make a more convincing case to skeptics to prove the two were exceptions and not the norm.\n\nIn light of Tuesday\u2019s news, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, took the opportunity to distinguish the crypto exchange he heads from Binance, which admitted to engaging in anti-money laundering, unlicensed money transmitting and sanctions violations.\n\n\u201cSince the founding of Coinbase back in 2012 we have taken a long-term view. I knew we needed to embrace compliance to become a generational company that stood the test of time,\u201d Armstrong said in a post on X Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s news reinforces that doing it the hard way was the right decision. We now have an opportunity to start a new chapter for this industry,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the same time, the government agencies overseeing crypto regulation and compliance don\u2019t want people to forget Bankman-Fried and Zhao.\n\n\u201cIn just the past month, the Justice Department has successfully prosecuted the CEOs of two of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges in two separate criminal cases,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cThe message here should be clear: Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disrupter. It makes you a criminal.\u201d\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the former chief executive officer of Binance, pled guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and faces a maximum sentence of 18 months in prison. Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nFor crypto, this isn\u2019t the FTX firestorm\n\nCryptocurrencies dipped on Tuesday as investors digested the latest regulatory news out of Washington DC. But by Wednesday, they had made a roaring comeback.\n\nBinance coin initially dropped about 6% after the US Department of Justice announced that it had brought charges against Zhao following a multi-year investigation into Binance. On Wednesday morning, prices had swung 3.5% higher.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies suffered on Tuesday as a larger crackdown by the Feds also roped in crypto firms like Kraken and Tether.\n\nBitcoin dropped by about $420, 1.1%, to $37,071. Ethereum, meanwhile, fell by $40, or 2%, to $1,997 per coin.\n\nBy Wednesday, both bitcoin and ethereum were back up. Bitcoin was up by 2.4%, and ethereum was 5% higher.\n\nSo what explains the swings?\n\nSome reports out late on Tuesday suggested that Zhao\u2019s deal with the Department of Justice could allow him to keep the majority of Binance\u2019s shares. That buoyed investors\u2019 hopes. They were also simply eager to see the long investigation finally wrap up.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s been a good year for crypto. Bitcoin is up by about 120% year-to-date. Ethereum has risen nearly 70% over the same period.\n\nBinance is exiting the US, but it isn\u2019t going away\n\nThe deal Binance reached with the government requires it to cease operating in the US.\n\nOn Tuesday evening people based in the US were greeted with a notice on the Binance.com site saying it \u201cis unavailable in your country or region.\u201d But there\u2019s a bit of fine print.\n\n\u201cIf you are in the United States or select U.S. territories, Binance.US is a U.S. regulated platform where you can buy, trade, convert, and stake crypto with low fees,\u201d the notice continued.\n\nBinance.US is a subsidiary of Binance that was created in 2019 to \u201cto serve U.S. consumers and adhere to U.S. regulations,\u201d according to a post on the site.\n\nBinance.US is not impacted by Tuesday\u2019s announcement, since it is a registered money services business, Treasury officials said. That means that people in the US could still buy and sell crypto under the Binance roof.\n\nThe feds are cracking down a lot harder on crypto these days\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement is a vivid example of the federal government\u2019s tough stance on illicit activities involving crypto. To put it simply, the feds \u2014 from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Treasury Department \u2014 aren\u2019t playing around.\n\nJust this week, the SEC sued Kraken, another crypto exchange, alleging that it is operating as an unregistered securities exchange. The agency\u2019s suit also alleges that the exchange comingled customers\u2019 assets with the company\u2019s own holdings.\n\nThat is not the first time the SEC has sued Kraken. In fact, it is one of several suits the agency has filed just this year against crypto companies such as Bittrex and Coinbase. The SEC\u2019s suit against Binance for allegedly violating investor-protection laws remains in litigation.\n\nBinance is exiting the US as part of the agreement the crypto exchange made with law enforcement agencies. Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDespite suffering some unfavorable rulings this year, the SEC is expected to continue to aggressively clamp down on crypto firms by taking them to court.\n\nBut if Tuesday\u2019s major announcement made anything clear, it is not only the SEC that is trying to keep crypto malfeasance at bay: It is the entire federal government.\n\nThat also includes the Justice Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , and the Treasury Department. There is even a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team within the Justice Department actively identifying and investigating criminal cases involving digital assets.\n\n\u201cWhile criminal and civil enforcement actions are subject to different legal standards, this collective effort represents the whole-of-government approach that we are taking to combat corporate crime,\u201d Garland said Tuesday.\n\nThere is still an appetite for new regulation\n\nUS officials already have a nifty toolbox of regulations at their disposal to root out financial crimes, such as laws criminalizing money laundering and bank fraud.\n\nThat is precisely how the feds secured the first ever corporate settlement with a crypto exchange.\n\n\u201cYou have seen both in our actions today and in prior cases that we will be relentless in using every tool that we currently have to deploy against those who seek to use technologies in a way that abuse those platforms \u2026 or [that] don\u2019t prevent the use of those platforms for illicit activities,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said during Tuesday\u2019s presser.\n\nBut officials suggested that there\u2019s room for new regulation.\n\nCalls for \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d are not new, and new crypto regulations could help both investors and law enforcement officials discern legitimate crypto products from criminal facades.\n\nIt is unclear how or when comprehensive crypto regulation would come about. One way is through rulemaking at the agency level either at the SEC or CFTC, which would still be subject to judicial review if challenged in the courts, and another is through Congress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve advocated for filling in some of these gaps, specifically around commodity tokens, and I do think if we\u2019re able to do that, obviously with Congress\u2019s help, we can prevent these actions from happening and not have to be here after the fact,\u201d CFTC Chair Rostin Benham said Tuesday."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s Hash Rate Hits All-time High, Shows Strong Network Ahead of Halving\n\nThe hash rate of Bitcoin has reached an all-time high level, demonstrating the network's increased resilience in preparation for the highly anticipated halving event next year. According to Blockchain.com, the total hash rate of Bitcoin reached 491 exahashes per second (TH/s) on Wednesday, indicating that mining machines worldwide are performing 491 quintillion hash computations every second.\n\nHash rate refers to the amount of computing power utilized per second, and higher hash rates make it more difficult for malicious actors to gain control of over 50% of the Bitcoin network. This surge in hash rate suggests a rise in mining activity as miners expand their operations and employ more machines to maximize their profits.\n\nHashing, which is the process of converting data into fixed-length character strings, plays a critical role in various Bitcoin network activities, including the creation of private keys for transactions\n\nWhile higher hash rates lead to increased energy consumption and costs for miners, the upcoming halving event, expected in April, has prompted miners to invest in more efficient machines, contributing to the rising hash rate. During the halving, the amount of newly minted Bitcoin awarded to miners is reduced by half every four years, which helps control the inflation of BTC. Despite past criticisms of Bitcoin's energy consumption, the rising hash rate highlights the ongoing efforts of miners to improve efficiency and sustainability within the industry.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

The company introduces a Thanksgiving Day promotion, including a $7 signup bonus for new users and a special Thanksgiving Rewards Event featuring tiered recharge rewards and referral gifts, enhancing the profitability and accessibility of crypto mining.\n\nLONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, Nov. 22, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\n\n\nIn an exciting development in the cryptocurrency world, GlobaleCrypto , a leader in digital asset and cloud mining services, has announced new opportunities in Bitcoin mining, proving it to be highly profitable in 2023. This revelation is set to change the dynamics of earning through cryptocurrency.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Mining in the Current Landscape\n\nBitcoin mining, a process of using computational power to transact and secure the Bitcoin network, remains a vital component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This process involves miners verifying transactions, assembling them into \"blocks,\" and adding them to the blockchain, a task that requires solving complex computational puzzles known as proof of work. Successful miners are rewarded with new Bitcoins, making the endeavor highly lucrative, especially considering the current BTC/USD exchange rates.\n\nThe Profitability of Bitcoin Mining\n\nBitcoin mining's profitability stems from its crucial role in maintaining the Bitcoin network's independence from centralized authorities. Every 10 minutes, miners confirm a block of transactions. The first to validate it earns a reward of 6.25 BTC, a significant sum given Bitcoin's current market value. However, the competitive nature of mining, driven by Bitcoin's value and the substantial rewards, necessitates significant investment in specialized hardware.\n\nGlobaleCrypto: A Game-Changer in Bitcoin Mining\n\nRecognizing the challenges of individual mining investments, GlobaleCrypto offers a compelling alternative with its cloud mining services .

In a memo released by the SEC on November 20, it was revealed that BlackRock presented two potential redemption models for its iShares Bitcoin Trust: one involving in-kind transactions and the other using cash.\n\nThere is increasing speculation that the SEC may be nearing a decision on approving a spot Bitcoin ETF for U.S. markets. However, uncertainty surrounds the response of SEC officials and the likelihood of approval, given the history of delays and rejections in this area. During the same period, representatives from Grayscale also met with SEC officials, as they too seek to list their own Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock is among several firms that have submitted applications for spot crypto ETFs, awaiting a response from the SEC. Notable applicants include Fidelity, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Valkyrie, VanEck, and Bitwise. BlackRock initially applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange back in June.\n\nThe outcome of these meetings and the potential decision by the SEC regarding a spot Bitcoin ETF is being closely monitored by the cryptocurrency industry and investors.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

Data from Coinglass shows that in the 12 hours since the settlement was announced, $110 million in bitcoin long positions were liquidated compared to $37.2 million in short positions. In the last hour, that number has reversed with $4.26 million in short positions being liquidated compared to $111,000 in longs."

        "content": "Celsius Network To Focus on Bitcoin Mining Following Post-Bankruptcy Restructuring\n\nCrypto lending platform Celsius Network has made changes to its plans after emerging from bankruptcy, focusing solely on Bitcoin mining due to regulatory concerns expressed by U.S. authorities about its other proposed business activities.\n\nCelsius had initially intended to generate income through \"staking\" fees, which involved validating blockchain transactions and managing cryptocurrency loans, as part of its restructuring strategy. However, the company announced on Monday that it had adjusted its direction based on feedback received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe revised plan, approved by a U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan on November 9, allowed Celsius to return cryptocurrency to its customers and establish a new company owned by Celsius creditors. However, the SEC did not explicitly state during the bankruptcy proceedings whether the new company's business plans would violate U.S. regulations.\n\nThis strategic shift has led to further negotiations with Fahrenheit, a consortium of bidders chosen to oversee the reorganized company. Celsius plans to seek court approval for a modified bankruptcy plan in the near future.\n\nCelsius anticipates that the reduced scope of the new company will lead to reduced management fees and enable a larger amount of cryptocurrency to be directly returned to customers starting in January 2024.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

A D.C. circuit court also issued a formal mandate last month to assert its August ruling, directing the regulator to re-review the firm's application.\n\nAn earlier filing showed that last week, Grayscale and the Bank of New York Mellon agreed to have BNY Mellon serve as the transfer agent for shares of the trust.\n\nGBTC intends to list the shares on NYSE Arca under the symbol GBTC, and issue the shares on an ongoing basis upon approval of its S-3 form and a separate 19b-4 filing from NYSE Arca, according to the S-3 filing submitted on Oct. 19.\n\nBlackRock meeting\n\nOther major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, are also seeking approval from the SEC for spot bitcoin ETFs.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market recently experienced events that were previously expected to present a severe negative price impact, and yet, Bitcoin (BTC) traded near $37,000 on Nov. 22 \u2014 essentially flat from three days prior.\n\nSuch performance was utterly unexpected given the relevance of Binance\u2019s plea deal on Nov. 21 with the United States government for violating laws involving money laundering and terror financing.\n\nBearish news has had limited impact on Bitcoin price\n\nOne might argue that entities have been manipulating Bitcoin\u2019s price to avoid contagion, possibly involving the issuing of unbacked stablecoins \u2014 especially those with direct ties to the exchanges suffering from regulatory pressure. Thus, to identify whether investors became highly risk-averse, one should analyze Bitcoin derivatives instead of focusing solely on the current price levels.\n\nThe U.S. government filed indictments against Binance and co-founder Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao in Washington state on Nov. 14, but the documents were unsealed on Nov. 21. After admitting the offenses, CZ stepped away from Binance management as part of the deal. Penalties totaled over $4 billion, including fines imposed on CZ personally. The news triggered a mere $50 million in BTC leveraged long futures contracts after Bitcoin\u2019s price momentarily traded down to $35,600.\n\nIt is worth noting that on Nov. 20, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission sued crypto exchange Kraken, alleging it commingled customer funds and failed to register with the regulator as a securities broker, dealer and clearing agency. Additionally, the complaint claimed Kraken paid for operational expenses directly from accounts containing customer assets. However, Kraken said the SEC\u2019s commingling accusations were previously earned fees, so essentially their proprietary assets.\n\nAnother potentially disastrous tidbit of news came from Mt. Gox, a now-defunct Bitcoin exchange that lost 850,000 BTC to a hack in 2014. Nobuaki Kobayashi, the Mt. Gox trustee, announced on Nov. 21 the redemption of $47 million in trust assets and reportedly plans to start the first cash repayments to creditors in 2023. Even though there was no information regarding the sale of Bitcoin assets, investors speculated that this final milestone is closer than ever.\n\nSeveral experienced traders and analysts had posted on social media that they anticipated a crypto market crash if Binance were indicted by the DOJ. Some examples are show below, and it is safe to say such a theory was almost a consensus among investors.\n\nETF denied, slow bleed is most likely, with a switch to hard crash if DOJ charges are unsealed soon against Binance. \u2014 Parrot Capital (@ParrotCapital) August 26, 2023\n\nI do not believe in coincidences. The Universe is rarely so lazy.\n\n\n\nExpecting ETFs to be rejected and DoJ to drop the hammer on Binance crushing bulls dreams for 2023. \u2014 McKenna (@Crypto_McKenna) July 31, 2023\n\nNotice how McKenna predicted that Binance would be indicted by the DOJ and further added that the ongoing Bitcoin spot exchange-traded (ETF) fund applications would be denied by the SEC. But as counterintuitive as it might sound, Binance going fully compliant increases the odds of a spot ETF approval. This is because it greatly weakens the SEC\u2019s main argument for previous denials, namely the excessive volume market share on unregulated exchanges.\n\nNothing concrete came out from the spot Bitcoin ETF in regard to recent regulatory actions, but the amends to multiple proposals are a hint of a healthy discussion with the SEC.\n\nBitcoin derivatives display resilience\n\nTo confirm if the Bitcoin price resilience aligns with professional investors\u2019 risk assessment, one should analyze BTC futures and options metrics. For instance, traders could have rushed to hedge their positions, which doesn\u2019t pressure the spot markets but vastly impacts BTC futures premium and options pricing.\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe price of Bitcoin monthly futures contracts tends to differ from regular spot exchanges since participants demand more money to delay the settlement. That\u2019s not exclusive to cryptocurrencies, and in a neutral market, it should stand near an annualized 5% rate.\n\nNotice how Bitcoin futures currently hold an 8% premium, which indicates excessive demand for leverage longs, but far from excessive. This level is lower than the 11.5% seen in mid-November but is quite positive given the recent regulatory news flow.\n\nRelated: BlackRock met with SEC officials to discuss spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nTo confirm if Bitcoin derivatives did not experience a huge inflow of hedge operations, one needs to analyze BTC option markets as well. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nWhen traders anticipate a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price, the delta 25% skew tends to rise above 7%, while periods of excitement typically see it dip below negative 7%.\n\nBitcoin options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs displayed above, the options 25% delta skew indicates optimism for the past four weeks, as the put (sell) options have been trading at a discount when compared with similar call (buy) options. More importantly, the recent news flow did not change professional traders\u2019 appetite for hedging strategies.\n\nOverall, there\u2019s no doubt that the impact of regulatory actions and the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox caught the market in a great mood, given the derivatives indicators.\n\nAdditionally, the liquidation of $70 million leveraged BTC longs reduced the pressure from future negative price oscillations, meaning even if the price revisits $35,000, there\u2019s no indication of excessive optimism.\n\nSince the final round of ETF decisions is scheduled for January and February, there\u2019s little incentive for Bitcoin bears to pressure the market while negative news has had zero impact. Ultimately, the path to $40,000 becomes more certain.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) market dominance has traditionally been viewed as a key indicator of its market strength. Currently, the metric is at a multiyear high above 51%.\n\nBitcoin dominance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nHowever, a closer analysis suggests that the concept of \u201cBitcoin dominance\u201d might not be as informative as it seems, especially when considering the broader dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nDominance: A misleading BTC indicator?\n\n\u201cBitcoin dominance\u201d refers to BTC\u2019s share of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. While on the surface, it seems to reflect Bitcoin\u2019s market strength, this metric largely represents the trading activity between Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), the second-biggest cryptocurrency and the largest altcoin by market cap.\n\nThis dynamic can distort the perceived dominance of Bitcoin, especially when major shifts occur within the ETH/BTC trading pair.\n\nRelated: Ethereum losing streak vs. Bitcoin hits 15 months \u2014 Can ETH price reverse course?\n\nThat said, ETH\u2019s \u201cdominance\u201d or share of the crypto market has remained relatively stable for the past few years at around 17% \u2014 while the seemingly inverse relationship between BTC dominance and ETH/BTC is clearly visible in the chart below.\n\nBitcoin dominance (blue) vs. ETH/BTC (orange). Source: TradingView\n\nThe role of stablecoins and \u201csidelined\u201d capital\n\nAdding complexity to the interpretation of Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is the role of stablecoins like Tether (USDT), the second-biggest \u201caltcoin\u201d by market dominance at around 6.3% as of Nov. 22.\n\nUSDT\u2019s market cap growth is often not a direct result of cryptocurrency market activity but rather an influx of what can be termed \u201csidelined\u201d capital \u2014 funds that are essentially in dollars and often waiting to enter the market sooner or later.\n\nTherefore, the increasing market cap of stablecoins like USDT doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect an investment in cryptocurrencies but rather the preparedness of investors to engage or hedge their crypto exposure.\n\nMeanwhile, the share of everything else that\u2019s not BTC, ETH or USDT is only at around 25%, falling from multiyear highs of 35% in 2022.\n\nBitcoin \u201cstrength\u201d or Ethereum market dynamics?\n\nThroughout 2023, the narrative of Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has fluctuated. While it appeared to regain dominance early in the year, this was more reflective of the ETH/BTC trading dynamics rather than an aggregate market movement.\n\nSimilarly, moments when Bitcoin\u2019s dominance appeared to wane \u2014 as seen with the Shapella upgrade impacting ETH prices\u200b\u200b \u2014 were more indicative of Ethereum\u2019s market movements rather than a decrease in Bitcoin\u2019s overall market \u201cstrength.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the dominance chart may not be the definitive metric for understanding Bitcoin\u2019s position in the market. Swayed heavily by the ETH/BTC trading pair, and synthetic dollars, it offers a narrow view of the market.\n\nIt\u2019s important to consider a more nuanced approach to market metrics that encompasses the multifaceted nature of cryptocurrency investments and movements.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "In this article BNB.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nBinance cofounder and CEO Changpeng Zhao speaks during the 2022 Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, on Nov. 1, 2022. Ben Mcshane | Sportsfile | Getty Images\n\nOutflows from Binance have amounted to more than $1 billion in the past 24 hours, not including bitcoin, according to data from blockchain analysis firm Nansen, after founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao stepped down and pleaded guilty Tuesday in a deal with the Department of Justice. Meanwhile, liquidity has dropped 25% over the same time frame as market makers pull back their positions, according to data provider Kaiko. The outflows are significant and close to what happened previously when the exchange and its founder were charged with 13 securities violations by the SEC.\n\nThe exchange's native token, BNB, is down more than 8% in the last 24 hours. Binance holds around $2.8 billion worth of BNB tokens, according to Nansen. And in March, after Binance phased out zero-fee trading of crypto asset pairs including bitcoin, a key incentive for customers, the exchange began to see its share of all spot trading drop. Binance remains the world's largest crypto exchange globally, processing billions of dollars in trading volume every year. Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines to the U.S. government. The plea deals end a yearslong investigation into the crypto exchange. Assets of more than $65 billion remain on the platform, according to Nansen, meaning that Binance is likely capitalized enough to withstand a sudden rush of investors away from the platform. And while withdrawals are on the up, there has not yet been a \"mass exodus\" of funds from the exchange. \"After the momentary shock of the agreement with the announcement, there is no significant impact on most assets,\" said Grzegorz Drozdz, a market analyst at investment firm Conotoxia Ltd. \"The cryptocurrency that seems to have suffered the most, losing more than 9%, is the BNB token from Binance. Of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, as many as 98 have seen a noticeable rebound over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, meanwhile, fell 4% before rebounding and remaining with a loss of 1.3%,\" he said. Drozdz added that it may be a net positive for the industry now that the dispute with regulators is behind Binance and that the company has pledged to increase security measures. \"This, combined with the likely imminent approval of an ETF based on bitcoin quotes, could positively impact the crypto market in the long term,\" said Drozdz.\n\nCan Binance survive at this stage?\n\nThat's the multibillion-dollar question the cryptocurrency giant faces after Zhao agreed to a plea deal and stepped down from the company. Started by the Chinese-born entrepreneur in 2017, Binance went from being a relatively obscure name to being a major force in crypto in a matter of weeks. Experts CNBC spoke with said that Binance is likely to make it through the ordeal despite a turbulent situation. They cited the company's decision to comply with the DOJ process and implement a three-year strategy to get its operations into compliance, and the amount of assets held within the company's reserves. \"The sum of $4 billion is clearly very large and will create real pain for Binance's balance sheet,\" Yesha Yadav, Milton R. Underwood professor of law and associate dean at Vanderbilt University, told CNBC via email. \"However, this fine does not appear aimed at dealing a fatal blow to the exchange. Based on Binance's dominant position within the crypto-ecosystem over a number of years, CZ's personal wealth ... and continuing trading volumes despite declines in overall crypto trading volume as well as in Binance's market share relative to other venues, I doubt that Binance will face risks to its solvency in paying this fine.\"\n\n$4.3 billion plea deal\n\nZhao and others were charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to implement an effective anti-money-laundering program and for willfully violating U.S. economic sanctions \"in a deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the U.S. market without implementing controls required by U.S. law,\" according to the Justice Department. Binance has agreed to forfeit $2.5 billion to the government and to pay a fine of $1.8 billion, for a total of $4.3 billion. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a press conference Tuesday that it's \"one of the largest penalties we have ever obtained.\" \"Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor. It makes you a criminal,\" Garland said. \"Binance prioritized its profits over the safety of the American people.\" Zhao said Tuesday in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that he had \"made mistakes\" and \"must take responsibility.\" Richard Teng, a former Abu Dhabi financial services regulator, was named as Zhao's replacement. Teng was most recently the global head of regional markets at Binance. He was also previously director of corporate finance at the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The action against Binance and its founder was a joint effort by the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Treasury Department. The Securities and Exchange Commission was notably absent. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a release Tuesday that the exchange allowed illicit actors to make more than 100,000 transactions that supported activities such as terrorism and illegal narcotics and that it allowed more than 1.5 million virtual currency trades that violated U.S. sanctions. It also allowed transactions associated with terrorist groups such as Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, al-Qaida and ISIS, Yellen said in the release, noting Binance \"never filed a single suspicious activity report.\" Zhao has been released on a $175 million personal recognizance bond secured by $15 million in cash and has a sentencing hearing scheduled for Feb. 23.\n\nBinance to continue"

        "content": "What Is Kraken?\n\nKraken is a cryptocurrency exchange based in San Francisco where market participants can trade various cryptocurrencies. The participants are allowed to buy or sell the cryptocurrencies using various fiat currencies, that include U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, and the Japanese yen.\n\nAs of January 15, 2023, Kraken is the world's third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, with a daily trading volume of $333 million according to exchange aggregator CoinMarketCap. Kraken allows trades in over 200 cryptocurrencies, and over 600 cryptocurrency pairs.\n\nVirtual currencies available on the Kraken exchange include the popular ones, like Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), and others that have gained traction in recent times, like EOS (EOS), Monero (XMR), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The platform also allows trades in cryptocurrency futures and derivatives.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Kraken is a cryptocurrency exchange based in San Francisco that was founded in 2011.\n\nAs of 2023, it is the world's third-largest exchange, with a daily trading volume of $333 million.\n\nAlong with other exchanges, Kraken has fallen under scrutiny by regulators for loose enforcement of controls against market manipulation and sanctions controls.\n\nOn Nov. 21, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Kraken, a US-based cryptocurrency exchange, for allegedly violating multiple infractions. Kraken is accused of commingling customer funds with company funds and operating an unregistered securities exchange, clearing agency, dealer, and broker. Both allegations may impact the operation of the cryptocurrency exchange and its customers' investments. To go with the lawsuit, on Feb. 9, 2023, Kraken agreed to pay $30 million in fines and closed its staking operation to settle with the SEC. However, Kraken is allowed to continue its staking process through its subsidiary for non-U.S. clients.\n\nHistory of Kraken\n\nKraken was established in 2011, and it formally launched trading operations in 2013. It is owned by Payward Inc. The current CEO is David Ripley, who replaced co-founder Jesse Powell in 2022.\n\nThe exchange provides the easy movement of money to and from the linked bank accounts of the participant, and the movement of cryptocurrencies to and from the participant's digital wallets from Kraken-linked trading accounts.\n\nIn 2014, as cryptocurrencies became more popular, Kraken, along with Coinbase exchange, was selected to provide the market data of bitcoin trading to the Bloomberg terminal. Getting associated with the leading market data provider helped Kraken gain popularity among the trader community. Bloomberg clients were then able to access virtual currency prices, charts, news, and social media posts through appropriate Bloomberg services and terminals.\n\nShortly afterward, Kraken partnered with the chart-service provider, TradingView. It continued to add more cryptocurrencies to its trading platform and enabled funding and trading in various fiat currencies like the USD, GBP, and JPY.\n\nKraken vs. Other Cryptocurrency Exchanges\n\nOver the years since its launch, a lot of factors have contributed to Kraken as a trading destination of choice for a variety of cryptocurrency market participants.\n\nAfter having a smooth initial phase post-launch, Kraken made headlines in late 2014, when it was selected \u201cto support an investigation into the missing bitcoins, as well as the distribution of remaining assets to Mt. Gox's creditors.\u201d\n\nMt. Gox, which once claimed to be the largest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy in early 2014. It was struggling with a huge debt pile, and 850,000 lost bitcoins.\n\nUp to that point, Kraken was not among the largest exchanges, and was primarily serving European customers through a partnership with Germany-based Fidor Bank, and had just started in Japan.\n\nIn February 2016, Kraken announced it was making significant progress in its Mt. Gox investigations and had approved numerous claims from thousands of creditors of Mt. Gox.\n\nGrowth during early 2015 was boosted by the launch of several new features that made cryptocurrency trading popular among the masses as well as among the professional traders community. It included launching the margin trading facility, and the dark pool services.\n\nDark pools clients are eligible for potentially better prices, as they are allowed to discreetly place large orders that get executed against similar-sized orders offering them price advantage.\n\n\n\nConcerns About Kraken\n\nIn May 2017, Kraken, along with the bitcoin exchange Poloniex, was hit with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, leading to huge losses for market participants.\n\nThe incident led to a class action lawsuit being filed against Kraken, where plaintiffs are seeking over $5 million which they claim they lost as a result of Kraken\u2019s mishandling of the DDoS attack.\n\nThe exchange has also fallen under scrutiny by government regulators. In 2018, the New York Attorney General identified it as one of several exchanges that were not following the state's financial regulations.\n\nIn 2019, the Office of Foreign Assets Control investigated Kraken for violating sanctions by transacting with customers based in Iran. The exchange settled for a penalty of $362,000, plus an additional $100,000 to be spent on enforcing sanctions controls.\n\nHow Do You Fund a Kraken Account? Kraken exchange users can start trading by creating an account and depositing their local currency. Note that the exchange requires customers to follow Know-Your-Customer protocols, including identity and image requirements.\n\nHow Big Is the Kraken Exchange? Kraken has a daily trading volume of $333 million, according to CoinMarketCap, although exchange volumes are particularly susceptible to manipulation. According to former CEO Jesse Powell, the exchange had about 6 million clients worldwide as of 2021.\n\nHow Do You Get a Coin Listed On Kraken? According to the Kraken Website, new listings are selected based on the qualifications of the project. Project developers and team leaders can propose a listing by emailing the details of their project to the exchange.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDespite recent challenges, Kraken remains among the most popular virtual currency trading platforms. While it is not uncommon to see even established stock exchanges get hit by temporary snags, the decentralized and anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies makes trading them very challenging.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrencies largely remain outside of the purview of government regulation, trading exchanges and marketplaces will need to balance regulations imposed by real-world regulators and the unknown, uncontrolled valuation mechanism of the various digital currencies.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "content": "A wave of optimism around the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States has ignited bullish price action in the crypto market in recent weeks.\n\nBut that could be just the beginning: If a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF is greenlit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, it would mark a major milestone in the history of digital assets.\n\nThe ETF would provide institutional investors with a simple and regulated way to get exposure to Bitcoin, with potentially explosive consequences for the market.\n\nAccording to many analysts, a spot Bitcoin ETF could spark a demand shock that, coupled with next year\u2019s Bitcoin halving event, could spark the new crypto bull market.\n\nThe SEC has so far rejected all applications, but two main factors make the current batch of applications different.\n\nOne is the involvement of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, which filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this year.\n\nThe second is the court ruling that required the SEC to revisit a previous rejection of Grayscale\u2019s application, defining the regulator\u2019s process as \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Grayscale decision ultimately says that you can\u2019t allow Bitcoin futures ETFs to trade and then argue that the same situation is not for spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d said James Seyffart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nThat is why, according to Seyffart, the odds of an approval by early January are 90%.\n\nTo understand why a spot Bitcoin ETF approval would be a big deal and its potential impact on the market, check out the full Cointelegraph Report on YouTube, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!"

        "title": "Are Bitcoin ETFs good for adoption or 'watered-down crypto'? Debate rages - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "CoinList founder Andy Bromberg believes that spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are just \u201cwatered down crypto\u201d and a sign the industry is heading in the wrong direction, amid growing hype over potential ETF approvals in the United States.\n\nBromberg \u2014 also CEO of payments-focused wallet app Beam \u2014 told Cointelegraph: \u201cIf a Bitcoin ETF is considered crypto, we\u2019ve failed as an industry.\u201d\n\nHe said a Bitcoin ETF would \u201cabsolutely\u201d be a net positive for crypto adoption but asserted the space\u2019s success comes from helping people self-custody assets and decouple from the traditional finance system \u2014 the antithesis of a TradFi ETF.\n\n\u201cIf crypto adoption happens mostly through ETFs and similar centralized financial instruments, then the core promises of the technology won\u2019t be realized \u2014 decentralization and true ownership.\u201d\n\nThe rise of rollups & account abstraction unlock the ability to build payment apps on Ethereum as good as \u2014 or better than \u2014 web2 products.\n\n\n\nBetween self-custody's regulatory viability and that new tech, it's the right place to focus.\n\n\n\nAnd it's what crypto is all about. \u2014 Andy Bromberg (@andy_bromberg) September 20, 2023\n\nBromberg\u2019s take is contrary to the prevailing sentiment of excitement around the potential for spot ETFs to bring in institutional money. Some predict ETFs could see Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization double and the price hit $150,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nCoinShares head of research James Butterfill told Cointelegraph that setting up a wallet for safe self-custody was still a daunting task for many non-tech-savvy institutional and retail investors. He believes an ETF will improve market access and will \u201chelp further democratize Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cSelf-custody simply isn\u2019t possible for many institutional funds, as it steps outside the regulated framework they must operate in,\u201d Butterfill said, adding that it\u2019s also the case for some retail investors.\n\nMatrixport research head and Crypto Titans author Markus Thielen agreed and argued the reason so much crypto remains on exchanges despite a string of collapses is because self-custody is \u201cstill problematic for most users and has clumsy interfaces.\u201d\n\nBromberg conceded that self-custody has historically been a challenge but pointed to technology such as account abstraction \u2014 which allows for wallet creation without using a seed phrase and more recovery options if access is lost \u2014 as proof it was possible to make \u201cmainstream-usable self-custody.\u201d\n\nInstitutional investors need legal clarity, not ETFs\n\nBromberg thinks the real solution to giving institutional investors who want to hold crypto a way to do so lies in regulatory agencies providing legal clarity and the industry giving education on technology and products for institutions to comfortably self-custody.\n\n\u201cThere are institutions that hold crypto on their balance sheet already, and others could follow,\u201d Bromberg said.\n\nMany public companies report crypto holdings, including car maker Tesla, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy and a host of crypto miners \u2014 although it\u2019s unknown what the custody arrangements are for most.\n\nWhenever the spot bitcoin ETF is approved, we will see what the true global demand looks like for the investment asset.\n\n\n\nLarge institutions aren\u2019t buying bitcoin for transactions, they will want exposure to the best store of value currently available. \u2014 Pomp (@APompliano) November 13, 2023\n\nButterfill said ETF-based Bitcoin holdings would come under a regulatory purview that would \u201censure high standards for custody.\u201d He explained that some Bitcoin ETF providers could offer physical redemption, similar to some gold-backed ETFs.\n\nWall Street suits won\u2019t change Bitcoin\n\nOther Bitcoin advocates are concerned about the possible influence that massive asset managers such as BlackRock could have over the Bitcoin network.\n\nIn October, Bitcoiner Peter McCormack told Altcoin Daily that a BlackRock ETF would be \u201cgood for price but bad for Bitcoin\u201d and expressed concern that it could end up the largest Bitcoin holder by way of its ETF.\n\nThe playbook:\n\n\n\n1. BlackRock files for an ETF.\n\n\n\n2. Retail buys #Bitcoin sending it higher in anticipation of being able to sell even higher to institutions who \u201cgEt iN LaTe\u201d.\n\n\n\n3. BlackRock dumps on retail (you) after the pump.\n\n\n\n4. BlackRock FUDs your bags back down so they can\u2026 https://t.co/SxBBKeAoI7 \u2014 SHELDON EVANS (@SheldonEvans) November 14, 2023\n\nButterfill said, however, that BlackRock would represent a \u201clarge and diverse set of clients\u201d within a regulated structure, which is \u201cvery different to an individual or the control a government could exert if there were such a large holder.\u201d\n\nRelated: Ex-Cantor execs launch crypto lending platform in expectation of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nTrading volumes of existing Bitcoin exchange-traded products typically make up a maximum of 5% of total Bitcoin volumes daily, \u201cso we have a very long way to go before ETPs could challenge the overall market,\u201d he explained.\n\nThielen welcomed the possible new Bitcoin holders, saying BlackRock\u2019s ETF would \u201copen the door to thousands of institutional players\u201d who he believes will use Bitcoin to replace \u201cgold and other safe-haven assets such as Treasurys.\u201d\n\nHe added that everybody has a right to own Bitcoin and that the cryptocurrency has become a speculative asset, mostly moving away from its peer-to-peer cash beginnings.\n\n\u201cWe should welcome \u2018the suits\u2019 from Wall Street to become promoters of Bitcoin. We can all benefit from it.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin?"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) bought on exchanges every year since 2017 is now on average in profit, the latest data confirms.\n\nCompiled by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, exchange withdrawal figures confirm that at $37,000, a user\u2019s purchase is on aggregate \u201cin the black.\u201d\n\nBitcoin exchange users claw back bear market losses\n\nBitcoin returned multiple investor cohorts to profit when it retook $30,000 last month, but current prices are having an impact on BTC buyers who entered much earlier.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, which monitors the aggregate price at which coins left exchange wallets each year since 2017, $34,700 is the magic number for turning a profit on investment.\n\nPut another way, anyone who withdrew Bitcoin from a major exchange since Jan. 1, 2017, is up in dollar terms compared to the year of withdrawal.\n\nThis includes those who purchased during Bitcoin\u2019s last bull run year, during which BTC/USD hit all-time highs of $69,000.\n\nThe last time BTC/USD traded above all the post-2017 cost basis lines was at the end of 2021.\n\n\u201cThe average withdrawal price for Bitcoin investors across all yearly classes are now in profit,\u201d Checkmate, Glassnode\u2019s lead on-chain analyst, wrote in X (formerly Twitter) commentary about the data on Nov. 21.\n\n\u201cThis model can be considered the \u2018DCA cost basis\u2019 for the average investor who started accumulating from 1-Jan of each year.

        "content": "Executives from crypto asset manager Grayscale have met with the Securities and Exchange Commission to discuss details of its flagship Bitcoin (BTC) trust, which the firm wants to convert to a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nA Nov. 20 SEC memo disclosed that Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein, legal chief Craig Salm, ETF head Dave LaValle and four other executives, along with five Davis Polk law firm representatives, met with the SEC\u2019s division of trading and markets.\n\nThe memo said discussions \u201cconcerned NYSE Arca, Inc.\u2019s proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E.\u201d\n\nGrayscale detailed that it had entered a transfer agency and service agreement with BNY Mellon, according to a filing shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.\n\nThe bank will act as the agent for its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), facilitating the issuance and redemption of shares and maintaining shareholder accounts.\n\nIn a Nov. 21 X (formerly Twitter) post, Seyffart observed that the trading and markets division is in charge of approving or denying Form 19b-4s \u2014 used to inform the SEC of a proposed rule change by a self-regulatory organization.\n\nSeyffart added that Grayscale\u2019s agreement with BNY Mellon was \u201clikely something that was always going to be required at some point\u201d and isn\u2019t an indicator that the GBTC will soon be converted.\n\nSince it feels like everyone is asking. Events of the last few days haven\u2019t changed my & @EricBalchunas\u2019 odds. We can\u2019t go any higher than 90% by Jan 10th. That said, things are continuing to move forward in our view. \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 21, 2023\n\nIn a Nov. 22 X post, The ETF Store president Nate Geraci opined that the \u201cmost substantive aspect of Grayscale\u2019s SEC meeting yesterday is that GBTC \u2018conversion\u2019 is being referred to as an \u2018uplisting.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t indicate any issues with conversion to ETF,\u201d he said.\n\nGrayscale has a real shot of dominating this ETF category if it can \u201cuplist GBTC to NYSE Arca on the same day other issuers launch spot BTC ETFs\u201d and make a concerted effort to compete on fees, Geraci added.\n\nIMO, most substantive aspect of Grayscale's SEC meeting yesterday (& today's subsequent 8k filing) is that GBTC \"conversion\" is being referred to as an \"uplisting\"...\n\n\n\nThat doesn't indicate any issues w/ conversion to ETF (contrary to the below). https://t.co/yAMBOsRlUs pic.twitter.com/nCZ8Z1ndNO \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) November 22, 2023\n\nGeraci said Grayscale will enter the markets on day one with $20 billion in assets under management, even with BlackRock in the mix.\n\nRelated: US court issues mandate for Grayscale ruling, paving way for SEC to review spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nGrayscale submitted a Form S-3 registration statement with the SEC on Oct. 19, which showed its intention to list the shares of GBTC on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol GBTC.\n\nIn October, a U.S. appellate court issued a mandate for the SEC to review its decision to deny Grayscale\u2019s bid to convert the GBTC to a spot ETF.\n\nThe firm is among other major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, seeking SEC approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSeyffart maintained that \u201cthings are continuing to move forward,\u201d and his odds of approval \u2014 a 90% likelihood that an ETF will be approved on or before Jan. 10, 2024 \u2014 remained the same.\n\nMagazine: Big Questions: Did the NSA create Bitcoin?"

It\u2019s unclear how SEC officials responded to the two proposed models or if they intend to approve a spot BTC ETF after numerous delays and rejections.\n\nLooks like @BlackRock also met with SEC! There\u2019s a couple slides in relation to in-kind vs cash creation.

If approved, it would be one of the most significant positive trends toward mainstream crypto adoption. SEC officials also met with Grayscale representatives on Nov. 20 in the firm\u2019s bid for listing a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nRelated: Spot Bitcoin ETF: Why this time is different\n\nBlackRock is one of many firms with spot crypto ETF applications in the SEC pipeline awaiting a response, including Fidelity, WisdomTree, Invesco Galaxy, Valkyrie, VanEck and Bitwise. The asset management company first applied for listing a spot BTC ETF in June on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nA video of SEC Chair Gary Gensler from 2019 resurfaced in October, in which he criticized the commission\u2019s \u201cinconsistent\u201d approach to spot BTC products. It\u2019s unclear whether the SEC chair will get behind efforts for crypto-linked investment vehicles, but the commission has previously approved ETFs tied to Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) futures.\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation: Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?"

        "title": "Rolexes, Bitcoin and Louboutins: What US Marshals Seize and Sell - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nRolexes, Bitcoin and Louboutins. What U.S. Marshals Seize and sell. So the U.S. Marshals are seizing these this contraband item. Who are they taking it from? What kind of criminals are we talking about here? Oh, you can kind of like take your pick. It's people who are involved in drug dealing, money laundering, Darkweb, the Internet stuff when they're selling drugs and malware and other sorts of things, then the items that the marshals seize are those that are basically proceeds from a crime or things that are used in the commission of crimes. And Michael, if I'm in the market to buy a Rolex, how do I attend one of these auctions and get my hand on a Rolex, which according to reporting, is at a pretty decent discount? Oh, yeah. That's the hard part, is sometimes that discount goes away. But these auctions happen online fairly often, and they partner with these national auction houses that basically like when you had a lot of really interesting things. Was there an item that stood out the most to you when you were doing your sleuthing through some of these filings? I think the racehorse was a really interesting one. That was the only animal that we saw on this list, and it was from an attorney who was basically taking funds from family members and other clients and used it to buy racehorses and all sorts of other things. Yeah, seem like Rolexes were a dime a dozen. There are a lot of Rolexes on there. Are there a couple of cars, classic cars? There's also digital coins, which you found were very a big haul in 2021. Makes sense given the price action. Yeah, absolutely. And I think, you know, unintentionally, the government probably made one of the best crypto trades of all time because they had they had all of this crypto that they seized and then sold it when it was basically at the highs. So I think it was something like $39 million from like 680 Bitcoin or something like they time the market like right at the top and entirely unintentionally, just given the way that the crypto markets were acting and upon. You know what interested me in all this? And we talk about, you know, this racehorse, the private jets, the boats, the digital coins, is that the auction data is not really accessible to the public. You actually had to file a Freedom of Information Act to get all this data to get five years worth of sales. Why is it not available to most people? Why is it not more public, given that the U.S. Marshal services are seizing this from criminals and taxpayers are funding a lot of these efforts? Yeah, I mean, they have annual reports. Second kind of breakdown of how much is being sold every year and how many items have been sold and how much has been given out in terms of victim compensation and that kind of thing. But there's no central database that tells you like they sold this Pokemon card on February 8th or whatever. So I don't know why they don't maintain a database that would have made my job a lot easier and I wouldn't have had to wait six months for it. But sometimes you just have to file the request and see what happens. And I filed this in September 2022, and I got it back in July 2023. And luckily it was free, but I just had to wait a bunch of time and it was not an easy thing to kind of like convert and get into Excel. It was all on like a PDF. And so there's a lot of work that had to be done to kind of get the project to publication. And Michael, this story has a lot of really cool graphics. I'm looking at the jump though, from 20 1922 and a half million dollars to more than $83 million in 2021. Is that more things being seized by the marshals, the more expensive items? What drove the run up because that was still before COVID. Yeah, there is a big ol cryptocurrency that was in there. And then I think the second biggest category is cars as well. So I want to say that part of the reason why that jump is so big is some of those crypto sales and you mentioned the graphics. Amanda Chan did a fantastic job putting all of this together. She's a Business Week designer. Where does this money go? Yes, When it is? Yes. What like the greatest, as you mentioned, great crypto trade by the U.S. government. Does it go to schools? Does it go to can they fund the government, fund the deficit? Yes. It does not go back to Treasury or anything like that. There's no deficit reduction or anything happening. It goes back to local law enforcement and then there's victim compensation funds to like if you were somebody who had been a victim of some sort of scammer crime and somebody, you know, stole your money to buy racehorses or cars or something like that, that money will hopefully go back to you. But it's not a sure process from what I heard. Like, I think they distributed $506 million of bonds last year, but some of that was around like prior years. So just like anything, it's going to take some time. We're talking we're talking to Bloomberg reporter Michael Tobin about a story about what U.S. marshals seize. Michael, with these big sales, do the auction houses get their traditional cut of the proceeds? Oh, that's a great question. I haven't I didn't have a chance to ask them that, but I know that they have what I assume is a contract with the US Marshals, all these auctions. But I have no idea about a cut from it. I don't think there's a buyer's premium on these either. So in a lot of auctions there can be like a 10% buyer's premium. But from what I've seen on the Marshals website, it doesn't look like it a buyer's premium on some of the auctions, least when when they auction off these items. Do people know that their seized items I mean, is it advertised as such? Yeah. So one of the auction houses, like the really big one, they do stuff with local governments as well but it specifically says US U.S. marshals forfeiture auctions. So it's it's pretty well advertised. Said this is property. Interesting. Is there a way to track where some of these items come from? I know you you in your reporting, you show like the Steinway piano for $34,000 belong to the consultant who allegedly made $30 million in a plot to bribe Indonesian government officials. Is there a way to see where the these pianos came from? Are these cars were pre-owned? That was honestly one of the hardest parts of this project. So a lot of this had to do with kind of like chasing down court records and then also doing more research on the Internet. But we have the Bloomberg Law tool, which is super helpful. So I was able to type in like specific keywords like Steinway piano, and I was able to pull off the court case because the government has to file documents essentially in which the property is the defendant. So the title of the case will be the United States of America versus 75 Gold bars, Steinway Piano, Serial Number, X-Y-Z or whatever. So if you're or if you are good at searching, you can kind of figure out kind of quickly where these are coming from. The hard part is some of the items are so fungible that you can't really say for sure if this one Rolex was connected to this one guy."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hash rate has hit a new all-time high\u2014indicating that the network is stronger than ever. Just in time for next year's highly anticipated halving.\n\nThe total Bitcoin hash rate hit 491 exahashes per second (TH/s) Wednesday, according to data from Blockchain.com. This means that every second, mining machines around the world securing the Bitcoin network are making 491 quintillion hash computations.\n\nHash rate refers to the amount of computing power used per second. The more computing power used, the more difficult it is for attackers to take control of more than 50% of the Bitcoin network. It also means there is more mining activity on the network as miners expand their operations and use more machines to continue to make as much profit as possible.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHash computations\u2014or hashing\u2014is the process of turning data into a fixed-length string of characters. It is needed to do things on the Bitcoin network like create private keys so users can make transactions.\n\nA higher hash rate means that it is difficult for attackers to take over the network because the malicious attacker would need to get enough mining power from machines to match the current hash rate and disrupt it. This would be a costly and energy-consuming process.\n\nAnd a higher hash rate means that more energy is needed, which in turn means more powerful mining hardware. This could result in higher costs for miners and more energy consumption\u2014something Bitcoin has been frequently criticized for in the past.\n\nBut ahead of next year\u2019s halving\u2014an event where the amount of Bitcoin awarded to miners is halved every four years\u2014miners are buying more efficient machines, sending the hash rate up, investor relations manager at Northern Data Henrike Christin M\u00fcller previously told Decrypt.\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving, the fourth of its kind since the cryptocurrency network launched in 2008, is expected to happen in April and is broadly viewed as a bullish indicator for the market. This is because the halving of rewards, baked into the Bitcoin protocol, is designed to keep BTC inflation in check.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEvery four years, the issuance of new Bitcoin is halved, reducing the supply of BTC that miners are able to unload onto the market\u2014and, if history is any indication, increasing demand for the existing BTC that is available on the market. Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, and there are currently just over 19.5 million coins in circulation."

        "content": "Now I look at two different simulations. On the top, I look at the PNL if the future price moves down slowly. Again, I can see that the PNL from both ideas is very similar and not dissimilar to the flat market. The net short options in both structures will provide the bulk of the PNL for position. What is more interesting to me is the chart on the bottom. This is the PNL for the structures if we move up quickly. I can see the put-spread collar has a negative PNL initially but this recovers as we near expiration over time. The opposite is true of the ratio call spread. The PNL of this structure moves higher but then peaks and rolls over near expiration. Thus, if I\u2019m inclined to trade out of this position before expiration, I may be better off using the ratio call spread which generates a similar profile in two scenarios and a better profile in a third.\n\nThe options market can be a powerful tool in the toolkit for the trader that knows how to interpret and optimize the strategies involved. Hopefully this week I got you to think outside the box a little bit.\n\nGood luck trading."

        "content": "Stocks have existed for more than a century. Bonds have been around for a few centuries. Commodities are centuries old and currencies have been exchanged since time immemorial. Now, there is a new asset class called \u201cCryptocurrencies\u201d which is gaining immense popularity all over the world. Work on blockchain technology began in the early 1990s, but was later used and designed by a person (or a group of people) under the pseudonym \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d. In 2008, he/ they released a white paper, \u201cBitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system\u201d and introduced to the world \u201cBitcoin\u201d.\n\nThis open, decentralised digital software has been gaining favour ever since. Before we talk about the potential and impact of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc., it is worth mentioning that equity investing has been beaten by the returns of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has given a return of 10,869 per cent since 2015 against 102 per cent of Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, 184 per cent of NASDAQ and 59 per cent of gold. Bitcoin has emerged as the clear leader. Therefore, having a small portion of cryptocurrencies in one\u2019s portfolio could be a smart move and worth the research.\n\nThe die-hard equity pundits have been denouncing cryptocurrencies for many years as a giant scam, however, slowly, a few hedge fund managers and institutions have had a transformation in their mindset and have started allocating their capital to cryptocurrencies and have even invested their treasury money into crypto assets! This is a big change and indicates a gradual shift in the attitude of influential investors. A lot of the naysayers missed out on the meteoric rise and gains from crypto assets and are now left with a painful left-out feeling. World economics are run by \u201cfiat money\u201d, which is essentially government-issued currency that is not backed by any commodity. This allows governments the flexibility to print money and keep control over their economies.\n\nGovernments have resorted to \u201cdebasement\u201d, which lowers the value of their currencies and increases the chances of inflation. Gold, traditionally, has been seen as a hedge against the debasement of currencies and inflation since it is a store of value and a preserver of purchasing power. Bitcoin has been called \u201cGold 2.0\u201d and even \u201cDigital Gold\u201d since it has certain characteristics that compete with and complement the intrinsic nature of gold.\n\nInterestingly, Nakamoto set the total limit of Bitcoin at 21 million, which means that there can only be 21 million Bitcoins in circulation at any point in time. There are several advantages of this limit that sets Bitcoin apart. Some of these are:\n\n\u2022 Every single transaction can be proved and is recorded in Bitcoin. This cannot be done for gold or other currencies.\n\n\u2022 Since the number of Bitcoin is limited, it is immune to any form of debasement and therefore a preserver of the purchasing power of the world and a store of value.\n\n\u2022 Other positive fundamentals of Bitcoin include an increasing number of transactions in the world, a rise in people using Bitcoin as \u2018wallets\u2019 and the growth of individuals, corporates and financial institutions embracing it for their investments.\n\n\u2022 Cryptocurrencies are enjoying the power of the \u201cNetwork effect\u201d \u2013 derived from Metcalfe\u2019s Law, which states that a network\u2019s value is proportional to the square of the number of its users. As more individuals participate and accept Bitcoin, the value of the cryptocurrency keeps growing. For example, if you are the only person using Google, then it will not be valuable. However, once millions of people use Google, it becomes useful and valuable.\n\n\u2022 Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, can be bought in a seamless manner, and as compared to securities, one does not have to worry about which company will eventually succeed and work.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin has an open decentralised digital protocol which is similar to the internet and its significance. Therefore, it has a strong and reliable computing network in this world, which allows for a high hash rate \u2013 meaning that the processing power of the network is high \u2013 which also creates greater security for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is portable, transferable and divisible. As an asset, it is durable and difficult to hack or fake. The wallets are encrypted and secure.\n\n\u2022 The verification of transactions is done by \u201cminers\u201d rather than a clearing house or exchange, as in the case of securities. Therefore, the process is quick and secure as well as inexpensive.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin can be exchanged for other goods and services, and also other cryptocurrencies and tokens.\n\nThese positive characteristics have led to crypto coming into vogue and accepting Bitcoin internationally. However, there is also a chorus of experts who are not yet comfortable owning cryptocurrencies. They cite many reasons. Some of them are enumerated below:\n\n\u2022 Some experts argue that cryptocurrencies can be a conduit for crime and money laundering. They cite that hoarding the crypto asset could be used to destabilise the dollar. There is a fear that non-state actors could attack the network to subvert economic functioning.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is not yet in the pantheon of currencies like the US dollar, Euro, or Pound. It is thus still a far cry from a replacement to any of these is still a far cry away.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is not properly regulated yet and the regulatory uncertainties create an atmosphere of risk around the asset. Proper regulation allows for the protection of investor interests, which traditional financial institutions, banks and money managers comply with.\n\n\u2022 Since no central bank is in charge of handling Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, the traditional role of central banks to set quantitative easing or tightening as and when the economy requires cannot be implemented. Economic growth and inflation control are actively supported by central banks.\n\n\u2022 Since the supply of Bitcoin is limited and fixed, it could lead to deflation if demand is not kickstarted with additional liquidity.\n\n\u2022 There is huge volatility in the price of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, which creates instability. \u2022 The wild price swings attract a lot of speculators and not holders who spend.\n\n\u2022 We have not yet seen employees getting paid in Bitcoin, which would prompt more sellers of goods and services to price their products in cryptocurrency. Most retailers are still reluctant to accept cryptocurrencies; therefore, they cannot function fully as a medium of exchange.\n\n\u2022 A plethora of cryptocurrencies have now sprung up, distracting from the main players like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n\u2022 People believe that crypto wallets can be hacked.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is facing an attack over energy use. To verify transactions, \u201cminers\u201d have to solve extremely complex math problems, which require superior computer systems that consume huge amounts of power, and use a lot of electricity. This means that many fossil fuels are being used to generate that power. There is a demand from investors to comply with better \u2018green\u2019 standards and use alternate power generation options.\n\nExperts of the stock markets and fund managers have traditionally ignored cryptocurrencies. They have argued that crypto assets have no price-earnings ratio or return on equity or cash flows to value them, which is why they have preferred to stay away from them. The valuation thesis of conducting a bottom-up analysis, i.e. trying to value a company based on its fundamentals, was found to be improbable and questionable for crypto assets. Further, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies display massive volatility of up to 15\u201330 per cent per day, so they decided not to jump onto the bandwagon.\n\nAlso, market pundits could not decide if Bitcoin was a commodity or a currency or even a security. Among other reasons, one was that blockchain technology was understood by only a few. Legendary investors have compared Bitcoin with gold and this has set into motion a number of companies, individuals and fund managers, rushing to buy crypto assets.\n\nExcerpted with permission from Investing Decoded: Simple Path to Building a Portfolio in Millions, Anirudh Rathore, Penguin India."
