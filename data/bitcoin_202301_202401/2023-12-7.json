        "content": "It should be no surprise that Bitcoin sold for over $44,000 this week, more than double its March 13 price. Going back to 2014, it has taken the cryptocurrency an average of nine months and 21 days to double; the milestone came 28 days early this time.\n\nWhat is mildly surprising is that Bitcoin doubled without ever falling below its March 13 low. On average, it has dropped 27% between doublings (that is, if it starts from $1,000, it drops to $730 before trading above $2,000) and it has dropped as much as 83% (trading for $170 before going to $2,000)."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nBitcoin is booming again, just weeks after the downfall of two of the industry\u2019s biggest names. Bulls are hoping the prosecutions draw a line under the sector\u2019s troubled past and will allow it to tap billions of dollars of cash from Wall Street.\n\nThe price of the most actively traded cryptocurrency has soared about 160 per cent this year to a 20-month high of $44,000, leading the charge among digital tokens as the gloomy sentiment that has hung over the market fades and traders pile back in.\n\nIt comes only weeks after the US successfully secured criminal prosecutions against Changpeng Zhao and Sam Bankman-Fried, the former chiefs of the Binance and FTX exchanges respectively and two of the biggest names associated with the bubble market of 2020-21.\n\nSpeculators are now betting that the toughest regulatory punishments have passed and bitcoin will be embraced by large global fund managers and investment banks.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at the two biggest guys in crypto potentially both going to jail and yet crypto goes on . . the old guard is being replaced by fresh money,\u201d said Ed Hindi, chief investment officer at investment management firm Tyr Capital.\n\n\u201cEverything has been thrown at bitcoin and it\u2019s held up, whether you like it or not, it\u2019s going to command a place in portfolios.\u201d\n\nThe surge in bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, comes as investors place bets on growth stocks and riskier assets in anticipation that central banks will begin cutting interest rates next year.\n\nCK Zheng, co-founder and chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund ZX Squared Capital, said Fed rate cuts were just \u201cthe icing on the cake\u201d. \u201cThe fundamentals of the bitcoin price are driven by the introduction of highly regulated companies into the market. Wall Street is coming to adopt crypto,\u201d he added.\n\nThe crypto market, known for its booms and busts, has a particular spring in its step after 20 months of negative headlines and painful declines. From a peak of just over $69,000 in November 2021, bitcoin had slumped in value by three quarters to just $16,000 at the start of this year.\n\nIts steady recovery this year gained momentum in November, particularly after US authorities fined Binance $4.3bn for breaching money laundering and financial sanctions. Crucially, it did not shut down the world\u2019s most influential crypto exchange.\n\nThat decision has helped draw out the crypto bulls. This week El Salvador\u2019s authoritarian president Nayib Bukele, under whom bitcoin became legal tender in 2021, triumphantly posted on social media site X that the country\u2019s holdings of the digital currency were back in profit. Meanwhile, Brian Armstrong, chief executive of US exchange Coinbase, said he had been contemplating how bitcoin \u201cmay be the key to extending western civilisation\u201d.\n\nSome even see the beginning of a new supercycle. Bernstein, the US investment bank, last month predicted bitcoin could more than treble in value to $150,000 by 2025.\n\nKey to the optimism is approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission for exchange traded funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe market has long viewed a spot bitcoin ETF as a way to tap US retail investors, with a cheap but safe and regulated investment product. For a decade the SEC has resisted all applications, arguing bitcoin prices are set on unregulated exchanges and so it cannot give adequate investor protections.\n\nBut pressure has been growing on the SEC since it lost a court ruling last summer on its reasons for blocking an ETF application by asset management firm Grayscale. BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are among the well-known names that have filed applications, raising hopes they can bring vast numbers of US retail investors to crypto. A decision from the SEC could come as soon as next month.\n\n\u201cJust improving market access shouldn\u2019t really buoy prices, but I think it does because it\u2019s an explicit nod from the SEC that they approve of bitcoin, at least in some respects,\u201d said James Butterfill, head of research at investment group CoinShares.\n\nMany investors have already bought cryptocurrencies in anticipation that demand will continue to grow. According to data from CoinShares, there have been 10 consecutive weeks of inflows into digital assets products, a wave of investment that came shortly after Grayscale\u2019s court victory over the SEC.\n\nSpeculators hope US regulators\u2019 acceptance of bitcoin ETFs will provide more durable support to prices, in contrast to previous bitcoin rallies, such as 2013, 2017 and 2021, when prices surged quickly only to collapse just as violently.\n\n\u201cThis will be the first time there could be true recognition of bitcoin . . . I do think this signifies that, this time, the rally will be more sustained,\u201d Butterfill added.\n\nOptimists also point to a technical change in the production of bitcoin that, they argue, will sustain demand. In April next year the number of bitcoin that miners receive for verifying cryptocurrency transactions will halve, with the aim of reducing the supply of fresh bitcoins on the market.\n\n\u201cThis will be a very strong technical driver for the price of bitcoin as mining becomes more difficult and less profitable, and scarcity continues to increase,\u201d said Tim Frost, chief executive of Yield App, a crypto platform that offers customers yields on digital assets.\n\nIn spite of the renewed confidence, some doubts linger over the durability of bitcoin\u2019s rally. Two of the US\u2019s largest ETF providers, Vanguard and State Street, have not filed to list a spot bitcoin ETF. State Street told Financial News in the summer that \u201cthere was no investment case for crypto\u201d.\n\nUS authorities have said that scrutiny on illicit behaviour in sub-sectors such as the stablecoin market will continue next year.\n\nThe SEC has outstanding cases against Binance and US-listed Coinbase, alleging both marketplaces were unregistered exchanges and sold unregistered securities. Victories for the SEC could force many of them to register with the regulator and impose tougher surveillance and transparency on their markets.\n\nSome industry insiders also doubt that the SEC will break the habit of a lifetime and approve a bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nDavid Mercer, chief executive of LMAX Group, a currency trading venue, said that SEC approval of an ETF was already priced into the market but added that the bigger goal was turning traditional assets such as securities into digital tokens.\n\n\u201cThe end game is most of traditional finance being enabled by blockchain in the decades to come, so from that perspective, we\u2019re just at the start,\u201d he added.\n\nBut after months of negative headlines and a barrage of enforcement actions, some hope the rally can merely mark a break from the past, rather than kick-starting another bull run.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on breaking out of this orbit we\u2019ve been locked in the last 18 months rather than some astronomical price spike,\u201d said Michael Safai, co-founder of trading firm Dexterity Capital. \u201cThose days are over, or they should be,\u201d Safai added."

        "content": "Since its inception, Bitcoin (BTC) has been the leading light in the world of cryptocurrency. It has dominated the markets and has been the market-leading cryptocurrency by a country mile. However, since reaching the $60,000 price mark in 2021, it was on a freefall till it hit rock bottom at $20,000. The good news is it is making rapid strides again and breached the $44,000 mark on Tuesday, Dec 5.\n\nThis optimism about BTC has been centered around many top investment firms from the traditional marketplace starting to file for U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) approval of their Bitcoin ETFs. Investors are currently anticipating a spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC as early as the first half of 2024. Many believe this could pave the way for a surge in institutional investment in the crypto sector.\n\nThe focus has also shifted to what the Fed's monetary policy will be in 2024. Currently, it is highly anticipated that the Fed will hold the interest rates at their current level in its Dec 13 meeting and start bringing it down sometime in first-quarter 2024. With interest rates coming down and investors getting more speculative, riskier asset classes like cryptocurrencies are well-positioned to benefit. In addition, the scheduled Bitcoin \u201chalving\u201d in April 2024 will slash the number of mined Bitcoins in what is expected to be a booming market for the benchmark crypto coin, thereby raising its price even further.\n\nAs of date, the price of the crypto behemoth has risen more than 150% in 2023 and constitutes 51.3% of the entire crypto market. Currently, it is on a steady march to cross the $50,000 level, and because of the factors mentioned above, it is expected to get further traction.

        "content": "On Thursday, the government of El Salvador, alongside the stablecoin company Tether, announced a joint initiative called \u201cAdopting El Salvador Freedom\u201d that allows foreigners to obtain a Salvadoran passport in exchange for paying $1 million in Bitcoin.\n\nIn 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, mandating that businesses accept the leading cryptocurrency as a form of payment and rolling out a digital wallet called \u201cChivo,\u201d incentivizing citizens to partake with a $30 sign-up bonus in Bitcoin.\n\nThe venture proved controversial, with Salvadorans protesting the move\u2014alongside President Nayib Bukele\u2019s concerning autocratic shift\u2014and adoption was slow, with the vast majority of citizens sticking with cash. Meanwhile, Bukele\u2019s spending tens of millions in federal funds on Bitcoin proved disastrous, with its price plummeting from an all-time high of around $69,000 in November 2021\u2014when Bukele announced the development of a \u201cBitcoin City\u201d\u2014to under $17,000 at the beginning of 2023.\n\nStill, El Salvador has proved popular with Bitcoin acolytes from around the world, with the country\u2019s tourism minister announcing in May that travelers were flocking to the country in historic numbers, driven by its commitment to crypto. That included many of the international community\u2019s most prominent \u201cBitcoin maxis,\u201d such as the influential company Swan Bitcoin, which opened a house in El Zonte, a surf town largely credited for starting the country\u2019s Bitcoin experiment.\n\nA steep decrease in the nation\u2019s crime\u2014spurred by Bukele\u2019s contentious policy of locking up thousands of the country\u2019s alleged gang members\u2014has further incentivized Bitcoin supporters to flock to the country.\n\n\u2018Visionary individuals\u2019\n\nThursday\u2019s announcement represents a new phase for El Salvador\u2019s commitment to Bitcoin, buoyed by Bukele\u2019s unverified pronouncement that his investment in Bitcoin has turned profitable, thanks to a recent price rally.\n\nThe Bukele administration has long partnered with Bitfinex, an affiliated company of Tether\u2014the world\u2019s leading stablecoin, or a crypto asset pegged, in this case, to the U.S. dollar\u2014that has faced scrutiny over its lack of transparency and offshore jurisdiction. In April, Bitfinex became the first company to receive a license in El Salvador\u2019s new crypto regulatory regime, and the government tapped the firm to help launch a long-delayed Bitcoin-backed bond.\n\nAccording to a statement from Tether shared with Fortune, the new visa program enables participants to obtain a Salvadoran passport through a one-time payment of $1 million in Bitcoin, which the company is describing as an \u201cinvestment,\u201d although it is unclear where the funding will be directed. The program is seeking \u201cvisionary individuals,\u201d including \u201chigh-net-worth investors.\u201d\n\nTo start the process, applicants must pay a nonrefundable deposit of $999 in Bitcoin and Ether, followed by an unspecified \u201cknow your customer\u201d process. The statement includes a government link to an application page, with a banner that says \u201cPowered by Tether.\u201d\n\nThe program comes alongside concerns from Salvadorans that an influx of tourists, especially in coastal cities like El Zonte attracting the crypto crowd, is pushing out lower-income families. In late November, local publication Mala Yerba reported that 25 families were facing eviction in El Zonte for the construction of a public park called \u201cBitcoin Beach Club de Playa.\u201d"

The report suggested Bitcoin\u2019s target price range could be $50,000 to $53,000 early next year.\n\n\"Bitcoin may be targeting $50,000 to $53,000 based on the network activity valuation perspective,\" CryptoQuant analysts said.\n\nSell pressure may be rising\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nThe report referenced the \u201cbitcoin bull-bear market cycle indicator,\u201d indicating a current bull market but nearing an \u201coverheated bull phase\u201d which historically aligns with price rally pauses or corrections.\n\n\n\nCryptoQuant analysts noted that Bitcoin\u2019s supply in profit is above 88%, and sell pressure may be increasing as a significant portion of circulating supply is in profit. The report, therefore, cautioned of potential short-term corrections, noting that high levels of circulating supply in profit often align with local market tops.\n\n\"Caution is advised due to the possibility of a short-term correction, given that 86% of the circulating supply is currently in profit and funding rates are noticeably elevated,\" the report said. Current data from CryptoQuant shows that the circulating supply of bitcoin in profit has now increased to over 88%. The report added that such high levels of circulating supply in profit \"have historically coincided with local tops.\"\n\nBitcoin fell by over 2% on Thursday, trading for $43,100 at 7:10 a.m. ET. The entire cryptocurrency market capitalization is down nearly 1% today, now valued at $1.64 trillion.\n\nNmerous analysts maintain a positive outlook for 2024, a sentiment reflected in the recent surge in prices.

Most of these issuers are already active in the crypto ETF space. They either have a bitcoin or ether futures ETF product or a crypto industry ETF product.\n\nWhile the spot bitcoin ETF market seems oversaturated, several large issuers are missing. ProShares, which has been well-known in the crypto space for its Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has not filed for a spot bitcoin ETF. Other crypto equity ETF issuers like First Trust, Schwab, and Amplify also have not filed for a spot bitcoin ETF. The reasons are unclear but could have to do with resources (staff, time, funds) for spot bitcoin ETFs (similar to commodities) versus resources for equity ETFs. Issuers may also not want to cannibalize their own products.\n\nProShares, which has been well-known in the crypto space for its Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) has not filed for a spot bitcoin ETF.

Prior to the release of BITO and its other bitcoin futures ETF peers, ETF investors were using industry crypto or thematic blockchain ETFs to access the cryptomarket. Currently, the top 10 sector ETFs YTD are all crypto or blockchain thematic ETFs. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) has been a top performer, returning over 200% YTD. It has been followed closely behind by the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP). These ETFs have been performing well since the beginning of the year due to lower prices at the end of 2022, particularly after the FTX fallout. Toward the end of 2023, these ETFs have seen even higher prices. That has been due to bitcoin prices rising on positive news from spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe biggest selling point of many crypto equity ETFs has been a close correlation to bitcoin prices. The funds all boast other advantages like supporting the digital disruption megatrend. But the blockchain story is still vague and foreign for many investors. And many of the individual stocks (particularly the miners) are volatile stocks.With crypto equity ETFs, the correlation with bitcoin prices is much higher than it is for crypto stocks and bitcoin prices. These ETFs may not be as good of a proxy for bitcoin prices after the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs. But they will still serve as high-risk/high-return options for investors who may want to capture potential large returns related to the cryptomarket.\n\nFor more news, information, and strategy, visit the Crypto Channel."

It\u2019s worth noting that markets aren\u2019t dumb; they tend to peak or bottom before an actual event.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent rally can be attributed to three factors: expectations that central banks are done with rate hikes, an anticipated approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, and the next bitcoin halving.\n\nBitcoin definitely knows how to make some noise. It\u2019s up by more than 163% this year, climbing almost 60% in the past six weeks alone. That boisterous rally, which has overshadowed other investments like stocks, bonds, and gold has got investors feeling rowdy. Whether you\u2019re a fan or not, it\u2019s worth taking a minute to understand what\u2019s driving the returns of one of the best-performing asset classes out there this year. Here\u2019s a quick look\u2026\n\nWhy is Bitcoin rallying now?\n\nThere have been three major factors at play. First, there\u2019s the market\u2019s hunch that central banks might be done with hiking interest rate hikes (and could even cut them). Second, there are rising hopes that spot bitcoin ETFs might finally gain regulatory approval early next year. And third, there\u2019s the big bitcoin halving, which is expected to happen in April. And though this one\u2019s a lesser driver, there\u2019s also a sense that the worst might be behind the sector after one of the most aggressive US crackdowns in its history \u2013 one that left FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried jailed for fraud and slapped Binance and its founder with anti-money-laundering fines.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re wondering how much further this coin can run, you might want to take those three big factors in turn\u2026\n\nFirst, interest rates.\n\nThis is never a bad place to start: interest rates are always the elephant in the room for markets.\n\nRight now, investors are betting that the Federal Reserve (the Fed) is at the end of its long, aggressive streak of interest rate hikes, and might soon move to cut rates. That prospect has stoked their appetite for riskier, higher-volatility assets like bitcoin and a slew of smaller cryptocurrencies like ether, and even dogecoin.\n\nSecond: the long-awaited (but still uncertain) spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis is something Wall Street\u2019s big wealth management houses have been trying to get approved for years: an ETF that would give investors exposure to the cryptocurrency by simply buying shares, just as they would with a stock.\n\nBut a spot bitcoin ETF wouldn\u2019t be entirely new. There are already bitcoin futures ETFs, which \u2013 like the proposed spot bitcoin ETFs \u2013 allow users to invest in bitcoin without directly owning it (That\u2019s the job of the ETF provider). And that means you can do away with digital keys and the hassle of securely storing your crypto. On paper, the difference between a spot bitcoin ETF and a bitcoin futures ETF isn\u2019t massive.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that the more obvious impact of a spot bitcoin ETF approval is a short-term rally in the price of bitcoin. The OG crypto shot up about 20% this summer in the weeks after BlackRock filed its spot bitcoin ETF application with US regulators. Some of that rally eventually faded, but there\u2019s still a lot of optimism that these new ETFs might encourage fresh investment from big-money institutional investors and individual retail investors who want to gain exposure to bitcoin\u2019s price without having to buy actual bitcoin. There\u2019s also a sense that they\u2019d bring more liquidity to bitcoin, making it easier for investors to trade the coin.\n\nNot everyone is sold, though. Analysts at JPMorgan have said the potential impact of the ETF is overstated. They note that bitcoin funds haven\u2019t drawn a ton of investor attention since 2021 and say that\u2019s unlikely to change with the marginal difference that spot bitcoin ETFs would offer. So, they say, you could see a brief rally in anticipation of a spot bitcoin ETF approval, but it probably won\u2019t last.\n\nThird: the halving.\n\nA bitcoin halving, also known as \u201cthe halvening\u201d, occurs roughly every four years, reducing (by half) the reward for mining new bitcoin blocks. And the next halving is expected to occur in April. This process is a part of bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy, designed to uphold the value of the crypto by decreasing the rate at which new bitcoins are created until it hits its maximum fixed total supply of 21 million coins in 2140.\n\nYou can think about it like this: Bitcoin has a total supply of 21 million coins, and over 90% of them have already been minted by miners. And at next halving, the number of new bitcoins minted per block will be cut in half for the fourth time in bitcoin\u2019s history \u2013 meaning the coin supply, which has been increasing by 1.8% a year lately will then increase at a pace of just 0.8%. As new coin production dwindles, the laws of supply and demand suggest that the price should trend higher (everything else being equal).\n\nIn the past, the year leading up to a halving event has been a great time to accumulate bitcoin. But there\u2019s also a psychological aspect to all this: bitcoin investors tend to get all hyped up about these events, and tend to think other investors are just as hyped, and that leads to a lot of people buying in at about the same time. Put differently, the anticipation of a halving-fueled rally helps create the rally.\n\nSo what\u2019s the opportunity here?\n\nEnthusiasm about where Bitcoin might head next is sky high, with predictions ranging from a short-term surge to $50,000, all the way up to an astronomical $530,000. But you may want to hold your horses rather than going full gallop down the Bitcoin stretch just now. After all, a rally without much fundamental basis can sputter just as quickly as it emerged.\n\nBitcoin has ridden the hype rollercoaster a lot lately, and that\u2019s sparked a ton of optimism. But, remember, the OG cryptocurrency would still have to climb another 65% from its current value just to get back to its 2021 peak of around $69,000. Past surges have often ended in downturns, like the 64% drop last year, which followed a 60% gain in 2021. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess when this particular rally might fizzle out, but it\u2019s important to note that markets aren\u2019t dumb: they tend to peak or bottom before an actual event.\n\nIf anything, the economic big picture tends to hold more sway over bitcoin\u2019s price. A key reason for Bitcoin\u2019s robust performance in 2020 and 2021 was the huge influx of money into the system during the pandemic. Recall that Bitcoin emerged from the aftermath of the 2008-09 financial crisis, and the Fed injected nearly $9 trillion through extensive bond-buying, or \u201cquantitative easing\u201d, programs until April last year, stimulative moves that the market equates to \u201cprinting money\u201d. So, with the Fed still warning about the potential for another rate increase and with that level of stimulus still nowhere in sight, you\u2019ve probably got plenty of time to jump on the bitcoin bandwagon."

        "content": "Blink and you missed it, but on Sunday night and into the early hours of Monday gold reached a record of more than $2,135 a troy ounce \u2014 and promptly fell back. Gold is now about 6% lower than that fleeting zenith and essentially unchanged from where it was a week ago. This isn\u2019t the behavior we expect of serious millennia-old asset classes; that\u2019s what magical new-age virtual tokens are for.\n\nGold's Icarus-like flight to new heights was probably triggered by a stop-loss in the derivatives market that prompted a raft of algorithmic buying, as the yellow metal has been bumping up against these record levels for the past three years. What's missing is a logical reason why this trusted store of value might suddenly be worth so much more \u2014 but then failed to sustain that new high.

        "content": "Derivatives are usually leveraged instruments, allowing traders to take bullish (long) or bearish (short) positions worth more than the amount they have deposited as a margin at the exchange. Leverage is a double-edged sword, magnifying both profits and losses. It also exposes traders to liquidations, or forced unwinding, due to margin shortfalls. Furthermore, mass liquidations often lead to exaggerated bullish or bearish moves, so the greater the use of leverage, the higher the probability of liquidations injecting volatility into the market."

        "content": "This year was a bloodbath for the crypto industry\u2014and for several of its biggest names, including Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao\u2014but it\u2019s become a victory lap for supporters of Bitcoin, which not only survived the calamity but ended the year with a spectacular rally.\n\nSwan, a leader among financial firms in the Bitcoin space, today announced an expansion of services that includes a foray into institutional products like Bitcoin-backed lending, along with $40 million in funding raised in 2023 for expansion efforts and another $205 million deployed across venture and private equity investments, a new hedge fund, and a credit fund.\n\nCory Klippsten founded Swan in 2019 as an investment platform focused solely on Bitcoin, offering basic asset management services to investors, including buying and selling crypto as well as crypto custody.\n\nKlippsten has also been a frequent critic of the rest of the crypto industry, pointing to the failures of firms such as FTX as an example of why the sector should focus on Bitcoin and move away from risky practices like rehypothecation, or using other investors\u2019 collateral for investments, which ultimately sunk other banklike platforms such as BlockFi, Celsius, and Genesis. He is also a visible figure in the Bitcoin community, with Swan opening a Bitcoin-dedicated house in El Salvador in the fall. El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Klippsten said Swan\u2019s resilience in the wake of so many industry failures drove the firm toward offering institutional services. \u201cWe had a thesis that with the destruction of capital and all the fraud and all the other crypto shenanigans\u2026that a lot of companies and family offices around the world still needed those types of services, and there weren\u2019t enough providers,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople trust us, and people like our brands.\u201d\n\nSwan 2.0\n\nSwan has not been free of controversy. The firm relied on Prime Trust for custody services, with the Nevada-based company filing for bankruptcy in August alongside allegations of mismanaging assets. Swan then turned to Fortress, which was founded by the former CEO of Prime Trust, before Fortress faced a hacking incident in early September, along with a failed acquisition by XRP issuer Ripple\u2014the very type of blockchain firm Klippsten often criticizes.\n\nSwan is now working with another custodial firm, BitGo, to launch a joint venture trust company, which would be the first Bitcoin-only trust in the U.S. Klippsten declined to say where they are applying for a charter but says that he hopes to launch it by the third quarter of 2024. Until then, Swan relies on a combination of Fortress, Bakkt, and BitGo. \u201cI could\u2019ve wished for better outcomes with those guys,\u201d he said of Fortress, although he noted that he still believes in the model of separating brokerage from custody.\n\nSwan\u2019s entrance into the crypto lending space is sure to evoke bad memories of failed platforms like Celsius and Genesis. Klippsten said Swan\u2019s differentiation is twofold: It will not rehypothecate customer assets, and it will only offer Bitcoin-backed loans. He pointed to a similar product from Silvergate, a crypto bank that collapsed in March but never lost customer funds for its asset-backed loans.\n\nWith the lending product, Swan users can deposit Bitcoin as collateral and receive around 50% back in dollar-denominated loans at an interest rate in the \u201clow double digits.\u201d On the other side, Swan will find creditors to loan capital, taking an origination fee and spread at their borrowing and lending rates. Klippsten said the lending product will launch in the next couple of weeks, with $20 million ready to deploy.\n\nSwan has raised around $165 million in equity funding in 2023, with $125 million for private equity and venture investments. An additional $50 million was raised for Swan\u2019s first hedge fund, as well as $30 million for credit funding that will go to its lending services. While Klippsten declined to share details on the spending, he said Swan\u2019s investments are focused on the Bitcoin ecosystem. Klippsten said Swan plans to raise another $150 million in 2024 to fund expansion.\n\nSwan\u2019s revenue streams are also quickly expanding, buoyed by other institutional offerings such as advisor services and asset management for investors. According to Klippsten, Swan had annualized revenue of $125 million in November and expects to cross the $200 million mark in the first quarter of next year."

        "title": "'Number go up': bitcoin's startling surge is inexplicable as ever - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nIf you ever see me, in any forum, recommending that people should buy crypto, then one of two things has happened. Either someone has created a deep fake of me, or I have been kidnapped. In the latter scenario, \u201cbuy crypto\u201d would be my secret distress signal. Call the cops.\n\nNonetheless, it is hard to ignore the startling rally in bitcoin. Trust me, I\u2019ve tried. Somehow, despite a swirling hellfire of regulatory aggression and legal strife afflicting several of the key institutions in this space, the price of this token has risen by 160 per cent this year (not a typo) to $44,000, in a rally that has accelerated sharply over the past week or so. That comfortably eclipses any traditional asset class on the planet.\n\nTo be clear, if people want to buy these tokens, I bear them no ill. People spend money on Crocs sandals, real ale and other things I don\u2019t like all the time. Similarly, taking a punt on a crypto token is just as valid as buying a lottery ticket or putting a fiver each way on the 1.40 at Kempton racecourse. Nothing wrong with that. If you want to do this, knock yourself out. I hope it makes you rich. If it does, the last laugh will be yours, so please don\u2019t bother sending the usual all-caps emails telling me I\u2019m an idiot \u2014 they\u2019ll just go in the file with the others.\n\nStill, what are the circumstances under which this works as an investment strategy? What does the price rise really mean? When the asset class is, say, stocks or bonds, investors have broadly agreed metrics and assumptions to answer those questions. But this is bitcoin. Strap in for a dizzying exercise of partially sensible but largely circular arguments that lots of reasonable people sincerely believe.\n\nZach Pandl is one of those people, who left a career in macro strategy at Goldman Sachs for a role as an analyst at Grayscale, which operates crypto investment trusts. \u201cI believe in the future of this,\u201d he says. But at the same time, \u201cI\u2019m not an ideological person here\u201d.\n\nPandl generally looks at the value of crypto tokens through the same lens as major currencies, which are broadly (and I stress broadly) determined by real interest rates and fund flows. Pandl reckons bitcoin\u2019s latest violent ascent is really down to the US Federal Reserve and the assumption it is done raising rates and may even cut them soonish. \u201cGold has noticed that, bonds have noticed that, and bitcoin has noticed that,\u201d he says. So far so plausible: the very large drop we have seen in bond yields recently boosts the relative allure of non-yielding assets like gold and crypto. But for Pandl, this is about more than just that.\n\nInstead, he says bitcoin is the only \u201cobvious competitor currency\u201d in the event that the US dollar is \u201cdebased\u201d. The euro, sterling, yen and renminbi do not, for him, pass the test. This requires you believe two things: that dollar debasement is really a thing, and that it can be replaced in its central role as the world\u2019s reserve currency by a token you cannot yet use to buy a cup of coffee. It\u2019s a stretch.\n\nApart from interest rates, another key short-term trigger often cited for bitcoin\u2019s latest rally is that the manifold well-publicised failures of crypto projects over the past year, and in particular last month\u2019s $4.3bn fine on Binance, could have been worse. My thought here is \u201capart from that, Mrs Lincoln, how was the play?\u201d But for those crypto proponents who are not in jail, the fact Binance still exists at all is a positive.\n\nThe big one though is investor demand. I am yet to meet a single chief investment officer or portfolio manager at any institutional money manager who has any interest in bitcoin. Boosters insist bitcoin is bringing in this kind of money, but beyond a few hedge funds, venture capital firms and family offices, the evidence for this is scant at best. Wealthy individuals are probably aware of bitcoin\u2019s latest leap, but even there, sector advisers are sceptical. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing more demand from the client side,\u201d said Christian Nolting, chief investment officer at Deutsche Bank Wealth Management. \u201cI have enough volatility on the bonds side, I don\u2019t need crypto for the vol,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is possible that if US regulators approve the launch of cash bitcoin exchange traded funds by institutions such as BlackRock, that might tempt more investors to seek exposure to crypto through them. This could, potentially, really be a breakthrough moment but the true demand is yet to be seen and it could already be priced in.\n\nThis is just one of the contradictory arguments here, though. At the same time, we are told crypto is up because sovereign citizens want to avoid government and regulatory intrusion, and it is up because it may be about to gain greater regulatory oversight. It is apparently simultaneously a bet on inflation falling, and a hedge against inflation rising. It is a currency, but also a speculative asset.\n\nThese things can\u2019t all be true at the same time. The fact is, different people buy crypto for all of these different reasons and more, contradictions be damned. The only thing the latest price rise tells you is that an unknown number of people are buying this illiquid token more enthusiastically than they were before. Number go up.\n\nkatie.martin@ft.com"

        "content": "Block, the payments company led by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, announced on Thursday that Bitkey, a physical device on which customers can store Bitcoin, was officially open for preorders in more than 95 countries.\n\nThe Bitcoin wallet will ship in early 2024 and cost $150 in the U.S., a purchase price that includes the actual wallet, a charging cable, a mobile app, as well as recovery tools.\n\nIn an interview with Fortune, Lindsey Grossman, the business lead for Bitkey, touted the wide international availability of the hardware wallet but said that Block was focusing on a select number of countries to promote its new device. She pointed to the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Nigeria, Argentina, Mexico, and India as key markets where Block believes customers would use Bitcoin for both long-term savings as well as cross-border payments.\n\nShe declined to specify any internal sales projections for the hardware wallet and said that, currently, Bitkey is not available in any brick-and-mortar stores. However, Block is \u201cdefinitely open to partnerships and exploring that,\u201d she added.\n\nThe opening of Bitkey to the general public follows an open beta for the device announced in June, and it continues Dorsey and Block\u2019s commitment to Bitcoin across the company\u2019s business verticals, despite the cryptocurrency\u2019s lack of centrality to Block\u2019s current quarterly revenue.\n\nFormerly known as Square, Block derives the majority of its profits from its digital wallet Cash App as well as its payments offering for businesses, Square. In the third quarter of 2023, Dorsey\u2019s firm generated a gross profit of $1.9 billion. The profit derived from customers\u2019 purchase and sale of Bitcoin, which Dorsey integrated into Cash App in 2018, was only $45 million.\n\nThat said, Dorsey is a noted Bitcoin evangelist, and in 2021, he changed the name of his payments company to Block to signify the firm\u2019s commitment to integrating Bitcoin into its core business.\n\nSince then, Dorsey himself has led a number of investments in Bitcoin-specific enterprises, including mining enterprises. Part of his Bitcoin boosterism is predicated on his belief\u2014one that many in the Bitcoin community share\u2014that the cryptocurrency is a means to open up the world\u2019s financial system to those in developing countries who often struggle to gain access to banks.\n\nAccordingly, Bitkey\u2019s availability in more than 95 countries echoes that ideology, beliefs that trickle down to Dorsey\u2019s employees. \u201cWe think that Bitcoin has the highest chance of actually solving true payments and economic problems for the world,\u201d Grossman, the Bitkey business lead, said."

        "title": "Global and local drivers of Bitcoin vis-\u00e0-vis fiat currencies - CEPR",
        "content": "Considering the apparent lack of a fundamental value (Papsdorf et al. 2022), the exponential growth in the volume of transactions involving Bitcoin and in its price is certainly surprising. After an initial popularity among a small community of experts, the usage of Bitcoin has been subsequently driven by the black market of illegal goods and services and by gambling (Foley et al. 2019, Marmora 2021). More recently, however, the soaring popularity of cryptocurrency exchange markets and Bitcoin might have also been driven by speculative motives (Baur et al. 2018) or, possibly, by its potential use for cross-border transactions and transfers (Graf von Luckner et al. 2023, Makarov and Schoar 2021), although the high volatility of its price makes Bitcoin impractical as a medium of exchange (Baur and Dimpfl 2021). The popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has not been confined to few economies, but it has morphed into a global phenomenon, with emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) at the forefront of crypto adoption (Chainanalysis 2022).\n\nTo what extent is Bitcoin usage a global phenomenon driven by speculative demand? To what extent can country-specific factors explain the use of Bitcoin? These are important questions for policymakers, both to assess the potential risks from cryptoassets and to decide how to regulate the crypto ecosystem, that so far have received only partial answers (Makarov and Schoar, 2021, Kawashima et al. 2022), largely due to the difficulty to trace who owns and trades cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo answer these questions, in a recent study (Di Casola et al. 2023), we overcome the obstacle of limited country-by-country information on cryptocurrency analysing trading volumes of Bitcoin against the fiat currencies of 14 advanced economies (AEs) and the currencies of 30 EMDEs in the largest peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges (LocalBitcoins and Paxful), over the period January 2018 to April 2022.\n\nPeer-to-peer exchanges perform transactions outside the blockchain network (i.e. they are off-chain) in a decentralised manner, target mainly small retail users, and are usually not affected by the problem of market manipulation, such as wash trading, typical of centralised exchanges (Cong et al. 2023), thus making the transactions we analyse more reliable. Peer-to-peer exchanges have gained popularity in particular in emerging markets and developing economies, being more suitable for their currencies that do not have a large trading pool to be easily used in centralised crypto exchanges (Aramonte et al. 2022).\n\nA global crypto cycle driven by speculative motives\n\nIn our empirical analysis, we find that momentum and volatility in the crypto-asset market as well as global financial market volatility and liquidity do matter for Bitcoin trading against different fiat currencies, including those of advanced economies. However, our crypto-assets and global drivers fail to capture the full extent of co-movement in Bitcoin trading across currencies and over time. Indeed, our analysis identifies a single global factor that on average explains up to around 40% of the variance of Bitcoin trading across different currencies in the Covid-19 period. There is therefore suggestive evidence of a global crypto cycle in Bitcoin transactions, echoing the findings of the global financial cycle literature for traditional asset markets (Miranda-Agrippino and Rey 2022). This global factor, in turn, is correlated with the Bitcoin price, as shown in Figure 1. Trading across currencies and users around the world moves in tandem with fluctuations in the Bitcoin price, suggesting that Bitcoin is largely used as a speculative investment asset across advanced, emerging, and developing economies.\n\nFigure 1 A global factor in Bitcoin trading volumes against fiat currencies is correlated with the Bitcoin price\n\nNotes: The figure shows the first factor extracted from the trading volume of Bitcoin transactions against fiat currencies (blue line) and the change in the Bitcoin price (yellow line). Trading volumes and the Bitcoin price are detrended with the log difference with respect to the past 15-week moving average.\n\nIn emerging and developing economies, other factors do matter for Bitcoin trading\n\nBitcoin seems to offer also some transactional benefits, in particular in emerging markets and developing economies. The depreciation of the domestic currency of EMDEs \u2013 notably not of the currencies of advanced economies \u2013 induces more Bitcoin trading, in particular since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. This indeed suggests that Bitcoin, despite its wide price fluctuations, might have been appreciated also as a store of value or medium of exchange in countries which experienced a loss in the purchasing power of their domestic currency. In turn, this implies that macroeconomic instability may potentially spur greater cryptoasset usage. This result is important for the asset pricing theory of cryptoassets (Biais et al. 2023), suggesting that the fundamental value of Bitcoin may be substantially different between advanced economies and emerging and developing economies, since its transactional services are probably more elevated in the latter group of countries. Moreover, we find that proxies of banking depth and digitalisation are negatively correlated with the extent to which each currency loads on the global common factor in Bitcoin trading volumes, indicating that crypto-assets may offer a speculative alternative to traditional finance when this is not available, in particular in emerging and developing economies where the share of younger risk-prone population is higher.\n\nPolicy implications\n\nOur findings clearly point to potential financial stability risks in emerging and developing economies with low levels of financial development and unstable fiat currencies. The intrinsic price volatility of Bitcoin may discourage its use as a store of value or means of payment. However, in the future, other crypto-assets, such as stablecoins that pledge to ensure a parity to the US dollar or other reserve currencies, might become more widely used by individuals and firms in order to compensate for the lack of financial alternatives, raising the risk of cryptoisation, i.e. the substitution of the domestic currency with a cryptocurrency \u2013 representing a threat to the implementation of capital flow management policies in these countries (He et al. 2022).\n\nAuthors\u2019 note: The views expressed in this column belong to the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the European Central Bank.\n\nReferences\n\nAramonte, S, H Wenqian and A Schrimpf (2022), \u201cTracing the Footprint of Cryptoization in Emerging Market Economies\u201d, BIS Quarterly Review, March.\n\nAuer, R and D Tercero-Lucas (2021), \u201cDistrust versus speculation?

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet approved an ETF that would hold bitcoin directly, though some expect that to soon change.\n\nThe regulator is set to rule on a proposal by Ark Invest and 21Shares \u2014 and potentially similar filings by a dozen others \u2014 by Jan. 10.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts have said they believe the chance of spot bitcoin ETF approval by that date is about 90% \u2014 an estimate former SEC executive John Reed Stark recently called \u201cabsolutely absurd.\u201d\n\nThe issuers hoping to launch these products range from the largest asset manager in the world, to smaller, more specialized firms. A Switzerland-based fund group threw its hat in the ring as recently as last week.\n\nA list compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s James Seyffart shows there are 13 proposed spot bitcoin ETFs currently in front of the SEC.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nLet\u2019s dive into each applicant and where their bids for a spot bitcoin ETF stand.\n\nGrayscale Investments\n\nGrayscale Investments\u2019 August court win over the SEC was one event that has catalyzed increased optimism around the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, according to industry watchers.\n\nJudges ruled at the time the regulator denying the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF \u2014 but allowing bitcoin futures-based ETFs to launch \u2014 was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The SEC opted not to challenge this ruling.\n\nGrayscale has said GBTC is ready to operate as an ETF upon regulatory approval, noting it would be \u201cworking collaboratively and expeditiously with the SEC.\u201d\n\nWhile the timeline for spot bitcoin ETF approval is \u201cinherently uncertain,\u201d Grayscale noted in a Dec. 1 blog post, the firm believes it is \u201ca matter of when, not a matter of if.\u201d\n\nIf Grayscale receives approval from the SEC, the company plans to immediately move GBTC from the OTCQX Market to NYSE Arca, Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm said in the post.\n\nThe simultaneous creations and redemptions \u2014 as a result of converting to an ETF \u2014 would essentially eliminate any discount or premium the shares have historically held and allow for the trust to more closely track BTC\u2019s value, the company has said.\n\nArk Invest, 21Shares\n\nThose watching the bitcoin ETF race have probably heard these firm names often. They first collaborated on a spot bitcoin fund proposal in 2021.\n\nThat application was blocked in March 2022, and the SEC denied a second attempt in January. But the companies\u2019 latest re-filing came in April, ahead of all subsequent applications by asset management giant BlackRock and others.\n\nThe SEC is expected to rule on the latest filing by Jan. 10, a date on which some segment observers believe the regulator will also decide the fate of similar proposals by other issuers.\n\n\u201cWe do think while we\u2019re first in line that a number of the firms will be approved at the same time,\u201d Ark CEO Cathie Wood said during a Wednesday webinar. \u201cDepending on exactly how they filed, it could be that more than a half dozen are approved in the first go.\u201d\n\nRead more: Spot bitcoin ETF would be \u2018final seal of approval\u2019 for institutions: Cathie Wood\n\nThe firms updated their bitcoin ETF application for a third time on Nov. 20, noting a sponsor fee of 0.80% of the trust\u2019s bitcoin holdings. The fund\u2019s shares would trade on the Cboe BZK Exchange with the ticker ARKB.\n\nBlackRock\n\nThey are the financial giant that manages $9 trillion or so in assets. The company\u2019s entrance into the spot bitcoin ETF race in June spurred many others to re-up their own bids for such a product.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s proposed iShares Bitcoin Trust would carry the ticker IBTC and trade on Nasdaq.\n\nThe company met several times with officials at the SEC\u2019s division of trading and markets last month. Its Nov. 20 meeting announcement included an outline of the difference between in-kind and cash redemption models.\n\nAuthorized participants for different ETFs engage in the creation and redemption of shares using two primary methods: in-kind or cash transactions.\n\nWith in-kind transactions, APs exchange ETF shares for a corresponding basket of securities that reflects the ETF\u2019s holdings. For in cash transactions, APs create or redeem shares in exchange for cash rather than securities.\n\nA document from Nov. 28 \u2014 a day in which another meeting took place \u2014 noted \u201cthe SEC has certain unresolved questions around the in-kind model.\u201d\n\nBlackRock\u2019s latest proposal amendment \u2014 filed on Monday \u2014 notes the trust would only accept in-kind creation and redemption requests from authorized participants and market makers that have implemented compliance programs.\n\nAmong other additions to the updated filing was the language around the firm raising $100,000 of seed capital for the fund.\n\nBitwise\n\nBitwise\u2019s latest S-1 amendment came the same day as BlackRock\u2019s. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF \u2014 formerly proposed to be named the Bitwise Bitcoin ETP Trust \u2014 would trade on the NYSE Arca under the ticker BITB.\n\n\u201cBoth the SEC and these issuers are working hard to iron things out,\u201d Seyffart said in a Monday X post. \u201cThese filings are likely the result of many conversations and a lot of man hours on/between both sides.\u201d\n\nBitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan has pointed to dialogue between issuers and the SEC as one reason \u201cit does feel different this time than it did a few months ago.\u201d\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF saga reaches \u2018pattern break\u2019 as amendments pile up\n\nLike others, Bitwise has looked to launch a spot bitcoin ETF for several years.\n\nThe firm submitted a 100-plus page white paper in October 2021. This showed the CME bitcoin futures market led the spot market and unregulated bitcoin futures market. It published additional research demonstrating that a new bitcoin ETP is unlikely to predominantly influence CME bitcoin futures market prices.\n\nBitwise, in a September filing, addressed eight disagreements the SEC had with research included in the company\u2019s previous application.\n\nVanEck\n\nVanEck updated its S-1 form for its VanEck Bitcoin Trust Friday, marking its fifth amendment. The fund\u2019s ticker is set to be HODL, the disclosure notes.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nHODL would trade on Cboe. The latest disclosure does not disclose a fee for the proposed product.\n\nVanEck has named Gemini Trust Company as custodian of the ETF\u2019s bitcoin \u2014 a divergence from most others who are trusting Coinbase with that responsibility.\n\nMatthew Sigel, VanEck\u2019s head of digital assets research, said in June the SEC should approve all spot bitcoin ETFs at once.\n\nSigel and VanEck investment analyst Patrick Bush wrote Thursday they expect such products to be approved in the first quarter. They estimate inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs will amount to roughly $1 billion in the first few days and $2.4 billion within the first three months.\n\nWisdomTree\n\nWisdomTree re-filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in June in the wake of BlackRock\u2019s filing.\n\nThe firm, with roughly $98 billion in assets under management, said in the disclosure: \u201cthe bitcoin market has matured such that it is operating at a level of efficiency and scale similar in material respects to established global equity, fixed income and commodity markets.\u201d\n\n\n\nWisdomTree amended its bitcoin ETF application on Nov. 16. The fund\u2019s shares would trade on the Cboe BZK Exchange with the ticker BTCW.\n\n\u201cIt does seem like there\u2019s been some exciting momentum, [and] we remain very focused on a spot bitcoin ETF,\u201d Will Peck, WisdomTree\u2019s head of digital assets, said during the company\u2019s October earnings call. \u201cWe think it\u2019s the best execution for the asset class in the traditional channels in the US, and we\u2019re looking forward to continue engaging with regulators on it.\u201d\n\nInvesco\n\nInvesco also re-filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in June, following in BlackRock\u2019s footsteps. The proposed ETF would list on the Cboe BZX exchange. The application was filed in partnership with Galaxy Digital, mirroring a 2021 bitcoin ETF application the two filed.\n\nThe firm made amendments to its application earlier this fall, showing that it continues to have dialogue with the regulators as they continue to mull a decision.\n\nThe ticker would be BTCO, according to a listing on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation.\n\nFidelity\n\nFidelity joined the current spot bitcoin ETF race as a re-filer, similar to Invesco and Ark. One thing that makes the proposed bitcoin ETF stand out is its custodian: Fidelity Digital Assets Services. It would not, unlike some of its competitors, use Coinbase.\n\nFidelity Digital Assets has offered custodian and trade execution services since 2018, making it a clear option for the firm to custody in-house.\n\nThe proposal was first filed in late June, meaning it also followed BlackRock. Back in 2021, Fidelity filed for a spot bitcoin ETF, though it was blocked by the SEC in January of last year.\n\nThe fund would trade under the ticker FBTC, according to the DTCC listing. Like Invesco, it would list on Cboe.\n\nValkyrie\n\nValkyrie filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in late June, following \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 BlackRock. It did, however, beat Fidelity to the punch with its filing by a few days.\n\nThe firm has also filed multiple amendments to its proposal. Unlike some other applicants, Valkyrie seemed to have fun with its proposed ticker, BRRR \u2014 seemingly a reference to the sound of a money printer.\n\nThe ETF would be listed on Nasdaq alongside BlackRock\u2019s proposed ETF. The two are the only funds who went with the Nasdaq exchange. Coinbase is, unsurprisingly, listed as the proposed custodian for the fund.\n\nThe SEC last delayed the Valkyrie application at the end of September, and its next deadline comes after the golden window laid out by Seyffart.\n\nValkyrie Chief Investment Officer Steven McClurg, in an interview with Schwab Network, said he believes the price of bitcoin \u2014 with both the halving and potential spot bitcoin ETF launches \u2014 could go as high as $100,000 next year.\n\nGlobal X\n\nAnother re-filer. Global X filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in August after initially pursuing one in 2021.\n\nLike others, it plans to list on the Cboe exchange, with Coinbase as a custodian. The application originally filed with the SEC listed Coinbase as a surveillance-sharing partner, in a move seen to appease regulators.\n\nThe application was delayed back in November, with the SEC saying \u2014 to no one\u2019s surprise \u2014 that it needed more time to consider the application.\n\nPrior to its delay, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas posted on X that discussions between the SEC and possible spot bitcoin ETF issuers about adding in cash-creations to the proposed ETFs 19b-4 filings. The discussions, Balchunas said, is a \u201cgood sign.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nHashdex\n\nHashdex filed its 19b-4 for its spot bitcoin ETF back in September, making it one of the later applicants.\n\nThe application, however, stands out from the rest because of its unique nature. Hashdex filed in late August to hold spot bitcoin in its bitcoin futures ETF. The application updated the name to the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF \u201cto reflect the Fund\u2019s updated investment strategy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of the few not relying on Coinbase as a surveillance sharing partner. It has instead opted to use CME\u2019s Market Exchange for Physical to \u201cacquire and dispose\u201d of bitcoin. It would also hold spot bitcoin, bitcoin futures contracts as well as cash and cash equivalents. It would list on the New York Stock Exchange alongside Grayscale if that fund is converted.\n\nThe updated fund would trade under its futures ticker DEFI.\n\nThe move, Seyffart posted at the end of August, \u201ccornered\u201d the SEC and commissioner Gary Gensler.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nFranklin Templeton\n\nFinancial services giant Franklin Templeton also entered the spot bitcoin ETF race in September. It seeks to list its fund on the Cboe BZX exchange. Like most of the other applicants, the firm tapped Coinbase as its custodian.\n\nThe proposed bitcoin ETF\u2019s comment period began at the end of November, leading some to believe that the SEC\u2019s move to start the period earlier than anticipated increases the possibility that bitcoin ETFs get a green light at the beginning of January.\n\nThe ETF, Franklin Templeton wrote in its initial proposal, would be a \u201cseries\u201d within the Franklin Templeton Digital Holdings Trust.\n\nPando Asset Management\n\nThe newest entrant to the spot bitcoin ETF race, Pando filed its proposal on November 29. The ETF, if cleared by the SEC, would list on Cboe \u2014 the exchange was picked by 8 of the 13 applicants.\n\nThe firm officially filed its 19b-4 earlier this week, officially putting them in the running for an ETF.\n\nThe Swiss asset manager has multiple crypto products trading on the SIX Swiss Exchange, but this would be its first US crypto offering.\n\nCoinbase would be the fund\u2019s custodian, and Pando tapped BNY Mellon as the trust administrator.\n\nWith its late entrance, it\u2019s unclear if Pando will be able to launch its ETF at the same time as, say, BlackRock or Ark if they get the go-ahead from the SEC.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Recession won't keep bitcoin from reaching new highs in 2024, VanEck predicts in yearly crypto forecast - The Block",
        "content": "Despite anticipating a long-forecast U.S. recession will finally hit next year, investment manager VanEck still sees expected spot ETF approvals and the upcoming halving event leading to new all-time highs for bitcoin by the fourth quarter, according to a new report.\n\nVanEck analysts Matthew Sigel and Patrick Bush expect the U.S. economy to succumb to a recession in the first half of 2024 as slowing economic momentum and cooling inflation leave it more vulnerable to shocks. However, the analysts also expect more than $2.4 billion will flow into U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in Q1 and keep prices elevated, if they're approved.\n\nVanEck believes the spot bitcoin ETFs would trade at around 0.1% spreads, with zero commission at many brokerages, catalyzing demand.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., having previously approved futures-based funds in 2021. The next deadlines for the SEC\u2019s decision to approve, reject or delay applications from firms including VanEck as well as BlackRock, Bitwise, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity and Valkyrie are expected to fall in mid-January. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart recently said the window for potential spot bitcoin ETF approval was looking like it would fall between Jan. 5 and Jan. 10.\n\nBitcoin's halving and all-time highs\n\nBitcoin BTC -5.49% \u2019s fourth halving \u2014 when the block reward gets cut in half \u2014 is expected to fall in April and is another potential catalyst, with prior halvings preceding significant run-ups for the cryptocurrency in 2016-2017 and 2020-2021. The VanEck analysts expect the event to pass with \"minimal drama,\" with bitcoin rising above $48,000 post-halving and miners seeing little distress thanks to much-improved balance sheets.\n\nThe analysts then expect bitcoin to climb a \"Presidential-sized wall of worry\" in the U.S. election year to reach an all-time high by November and an ultimate cycle peak of up to $160,000. \u201cIf bitcoin reaches $100,000 by December, we make a long-shot call that Satoshi Nakamoto will be named Time Magazine's 'Man of the Year,'\" they added.\n\nBitcoin currently trades at $44,006, up 165% year-to-date, according to The Block's price data.\n\nEther won\u2019t flip bitcoin, but solana will continue to outperform\n\nSigel and Bush said ether won\u2019t flip bitcoin\u2019s market cap in 2024, particularly with bitcoin's more apparent regulatory status, but it will outperform mega-cap tech stocks. Like past cycles, VanEck expects bitcoin to lead the rally next year, with ether not beginning to outperform until after the halving. But there will be no \"flippening,\" they said.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe ETH -5.94% :BTC price ratio is currently near its lowest level since July 2022 at around 0.05.\n\nThe analysts argued that ether will also lose market share to other smart contract platforms with less uncertainty surrounding scalability, such as Solana SOL +7.77% . They also expect Ethereum Layer 2s, such as Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism, to consolidate toward two or three dominant players by value and usage \u2014 with one achieving higher monthly DEX volume and Total Value Locked than Ethereum for the first time.\n\nVanEck anticipates solana becoming a top three cryptocurrency by market cap in 2024, behind bitcoin and ether, fueled by a rise in DeFi activity on the blockchain to join the \"spot ETF wars\" with the top two digital assets.\n\nBinance to lose top spot, and NFT activity rebound\n\nThe VanEck analysts also expect Binance to lose its throne as the top crypto exchange by spot trading volume in 2024 after the company\u2019s $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities and a year of regulatory issues for the platform.\n\nThe analysts argued one of OKX, Bybit or Coinbase would grab the top spot, though they also expect the decentralized exchange share of spot market trading volume compared to centralized exchanges to reach new all-time highs.\n\nAdditionally, Sigel and Bush anticipate a rebound in NFT activity to reach all-time highs next year as speculators gravitate toward top collections on Ethereum and new Bitcoin-based offerings. They also expect a breakout blockchain game to finally arrive.\n\nAmong VanEck's other expectations for the year ahead, its analysts saw the stablecoin market cap reaching a new all-time high as USDC reverses its market share losses this year and the DeFi industry reconciling with the idea of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) functionality on their front-ends.\n\nIt should be noted that VanEck may hold positions in any digital assets it mentions."

        "content": "Key Takeaways JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said he would close down crypto if he was the government during a Senate hearing on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Dimon has made negative comments about Bitcoin since at least 2014, JPMorgan Chase uses blockchain technology in their JPM Coin offering.\n\nDespite concerns regarding crypto regulation, the bitcoin price has been booming as anticipation for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval builds.\n\nThis week JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon expressed his opposition for cryptocurrencies and bitcoin at a Senate hearing, albeit not for the first time.\n\nDimon's been making public comments about crypto since at least 2014. While he has made seemingly contrasting statements over the years, his general thesis has been unwavering.\n\nHere's what he has said over the years and some context around JPMorgan's blockchain foray to help understand where Dimon actually stands on crypto.\n\n\n\n2014: Terrible Store Of Value\n\nDimon has been sharing his thoughts on bitcoin (BTCUSD) and other related technologies since at least 2014.\n\n\"It\u2019s a terrible store of value, it can be replicated over and over. It doesn\u2019t have the standing of a government,\" he told CNBC in an interview.\n\n\n\n2017: \"Fraud\", \"Worse Than Tulip Bulbs\"\n\nIn September 2017, Dimon called bitcoin a fraud, going as far as labeling it worse than tulip bulbs\u2014a reference to Tulipmania or the Tulip Bulb market bubble.\n\n\"I\u2019d fire them in a second,\" Bloomberg reported Dimon saying of any JPMorgan trader trading bitcoin \"For two reasons: It\u2019s against our rules, and they\u2019re stupid. And both are dangerous.\u201d\n\n2017: \"God Bless The Blockchain\"\n\nJust a month later in October, JPMorgan launched its blockchain initiative to help make interbank payments.\n\nThree days prior to that launch, Dimon talked up the potential for blockchain technology\u2014the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"I could care less about bitcoin. I don\u2019t know why I said anything about it. The blockchain is a technology which is a good technology. We actually use it. It will be useful in a lot of different things. God bless the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies, digital currencies, I think are also fine. JPMorgan moves $6 trillion around the world every day, and we don\u2019t do it in cash, it\u2019s done digitally. If it can be done digitally with the blockchain, so be it,\" CNBC reported Dimon saying.\n\nDimon did issue a warning to investors putting money into bitcoin, however, calling them \"stupid.\"\n\n2018: \"Regret\"\n\nAt the beginning of 2018, just a few months after JPMorgan's blockchain was launched, Dimon expressed regret over his bitcoin fraud remark from the year before in an interview with Fox Business.\n\n2019: JPM Coin Appears\n\nJPMorgan as an institution was taking big strides in incorporating blockchain technology into the realm of traditional finance. It experimented with its own dollar-backed digital coin akin to a stablecoin called JPM Coin for payments between clients, CNBC reported in February 2019.\n\nThe bank also made key hires and worked has grown JPM Coin, which is now said to account for a billion dollars worth of daily transactions.\n\n2023: \"Close It Down\"\n\n\"I've always been deeply opposed to crypto, bitcoin, etc,\" said Dimon in response to a question from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren at a Senate hearing on Wednesday. \"You pointed out the only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money launderers, [and] tax avoidance . . . If I was the government, I'd close it down,\" he added.\n\nDuring the hearing, both Dimon and Warren made the point that a problem with crypto is that it lives outside the traditional financial system, which has several safeguards in place to prevent the proliferation of illicit finance.\n\nWhile lack of regulation remains a contentious issue, many traditional finance firms are beginning to put their weight behind bitcoin. Blackrock (BLK) and Fidelity have filed their applications for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, that is currently awaiting regulatory approvals. The optimism around the ETF has fueled a resurgence in bitcoin prices.\n\nBlackrock has come around after harboring views similar to Dimon on bitcoin investing in 2019."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) options open interest reached an unprecedented milestone, surging to a staggering $20.5 billion on Dec. 7. This signifies the active involvement of institutional investors in the cryptocurrency space. Unlike futures contracts, BTC options have predetermined expiration prices, offering valuable insights into traders\u2019 expectations and market sentiment.\n\nAt the forefront of the Bitcoin options market stands Deribit, boasting a 90% market share. The exchange currently holds a substantial $2.05 billion open interest for options expiring on Jan. 26. However, many of these bets may lose their value as the deadline approaches.\n\nDeribit BTC options open interest for Jan. 26, BTC terms. Source: Deribit\n\nNonetheless, with the prospect of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) gaining regulatory approval, previously sidelined bullish bets are reentering the playing field.\n\nHow costly is a Bitcoin call (buy) option?\n\nPresently, the $54,000 call option set to expire on Jan. 26 is trading at 0.02 BTC or $880 at current market prices. This option necessitates a 25% increase in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the next 49 days for the buyer to turn a profit. Sellers can hedge their positions using BTC futures while pocketing the options premium, mitigating some of the perceived risk of this trade.\n\nAnalysts have emphasized the significance of the $250 million open interest stemming from the $50,000 call options on Deribit. At the current price of $44,000, these options are collectively valued at $8.8 million. This valuation could experience considerable growth if regulatory authorities greenlight the spot ETF plans. However, it remains uncertain whether the buyers of these $50,000 call options intend to employ them for bullish strategies.\n\nThe relatively modest demand for call options within the $70,000 to $80,000 range, accounting for less than 20% of the open interest, suggests a lack of exuberance among bulls. With an exposure of $285 million, these options are currently valued at just $1.2 million. In comparison, the open interest for $60,000 and $65,000 call options set to expire on Dec. 29 amounts to $250 million.\n\nTurning to the put options, traders appear to have positioned themselves cautiously for the January expiry, with 97% of bets placed at $42,000 or lower. Unless the current price trajectory reverses, the $568 million open interest in put options may face bleak prospects. Nevertheless, selling put options can offer traders a means to gain positive exposure to Bitcoin above specific price levels, though estimating the exact impact remains challenging.\n\nRelated: SEC discussing \u2018key technical details\u2019 with spot crypto ETF applicants- Report\n\nBitcoin put options should not be dismissed \u2014 yet\n\nThe open interest in Jan. 26 call options surpasses that of put options on Deribit by a factor of 2.6, signaling a greater demand for neutral-to-bullish strategies. While the allure of the $50,000 call options is undeniable and holds the potential to drive Bitcoin\u2019s price higher, it\u2019s essential to remember that the expiration price is determined solely at 8:00 am UTC on Jan. 26, making it premature to expend substantial efforts at this stage.\n\nFor Bitcoin bears, the ideal scenario hinges on the ETF proposal being rejected. However, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission may request additional time to reach a final decision, especially considering recent amendments to many filings. Presently, industry experts, including senior ETF analysts at Bloomberg, estimate a 90% likelihood of approval in 2024, a projection extending beyond January.\n\nWith 49 days remaining until the Jan. 26 expiry, prematurely dismissing the 97% of put options as worthless seems unwarranted. Additionally, bears have the regulatory landscape on their side, as the trial involving Binance and its founder, Changzeng Zhao, has only just commenced.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Babylon, a bitcoin staking protocol under development, has raised $18 million in a Series A funding round co-led by Polychain Capital and Hack VC.\n\nOther investors in the round include Framework Ventures, Polygon MATIC -8.72% Ventures, Castle Island Ventures, OKX Ventures and Symbolic Capital, Babylon said Thursday. The project began raising for the round at the end of July and \"just closed it,\" David Tse, co-founder of Babylon and an engineering professor at Stanford University, told The Block.\n\nIt was an equity plus token warrant round \u2014 the same structure as Babylon's $8 million seed funding round disclosed in March \u2014 Tse said. He declined to comment on Babylon's valuation with the round.\n\nWhat is Babylon?\n\nThe Babylon protocol will allow bitcoin holders to stake their coins on proof-of-stake blockchains and earn yield. The protocol will essentially allow PoS chains to introduce bitcoin as a staking asset on their networks. Babylon aims to use Bitcoin BTC -5.49% 's security to enhance the security of PoS chains.\n\nPoS chains are currently secured by capital from their native tokens. Still, that capital can be costly, especially for emerging chains, as high inflation rates are required to pay high staking yields to attract such capital. The Cosmos Hub ATOM -5.34% community, for instance, recently approved a proposal to reduce the maximum inflation rate of its native token Atom from about 14% to 10%. The approved change would bring Atom's annualized staking yield from approximately 19% to about 13.4%.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBabylon is already in talks to support the Cosmos Hub and Polygon networks, Tse said. \"Babylon is becoming a contributor to Polygon CDK [Chain Development Kit ] and the Polygon ecosystem more broadly,\" Polygon co-founder of Polygon Sandeep Nailwal said in a statement. \"Babylon integrating their solution into Polygon's staking hub not only bolsters the security of emerging chains but also addresses inflationary pressures inherent in traditional staking models.\"\n\nBabylon launch\n\nThe Babylon protocol is expected to launch \"around the next Bitcoin halving,\" Tse said. The halving is expected to occur in April 2024. Once launched, the Babylon chain protocol will \"serve as the control plane\" between Bitcoin and PoS chains, Tse said.\n\nWith the fresh capital in hand, Babylon looks to expand its current team of about 15 people and grow its ecosystem, Tse added."

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Bitcoin This Year? Or Is This Just the Start of a New Bull Market for Crypto? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's hard to believe Bitcoin (BTC -5.55%) is up more than 50% in Q3, hit a new 52-week high of nearly $44,000, and is up more than 160% in 2023. By nearly every account, it seems that Bitcoin has shaken off the frost from a brutal crypto winter.\n\nYet, given the magnitude of the gains this year, is it possible that investors have missed the Bitcoin boat? The answer might surprise you, but several signs indicate Bitcoin's best days remain ahead for three key reasons.\n\nCyclical growth\n\nSimilar to the stock market, Bitcoin goes through phases. This isn't some novel insight. Cycles of growth, like we saw in 2021, are followed by periods of contraction. While those down periods can be painful, they are only natural.\n\nAt the start of 2022, a brutal crypto contraction began. Bitcoin fell by 65% at its lowest point in that cycle, and the overall crypto market cap slumped by 80%. But now, a new growth cycle is starting, and it is right on time with historical trends. There is some ambiguity when measuring the durations of bull and bear markets, but history shows that the average bear market lasts around 300 days or so. By most estimates, this most recent crypto winter was its longest ever at nearly 490 days. Put simply, based solely on the patterns of the past, we are a bit overdue for a recovery.\n\nIf this is the beginning of a new bull market, as it looks to be, it means there is still plenty of room for Bitcoin to run. In bull markets, it hasn't been uncommon for Bitcoin to increase exponentially, with momentum often lasting for the greater part of a year.\n\nAnalyzing short-term drivers\n\nIn April 2024, Bitcoin will undergo its fourth halving event. These events are hardwired into Bitcoin's code, and occur every time 210,000 blocks are added to its blockchain -- roughly every four years. At those points, the amount of new tokens that Bitcoin miners are paid for solving hashes and verifying transactions on the blockchain is cut in half -- reducing the effective \"inflation\" rate at which new tokens are produced. This is one of the primary features that preserves Bitcoin's sound monetary policy, upholds its finite nature, and makes it an effective store of value.\n\nIn Bitcoin's early days, its inflation rate was more than 10%. But with three halvings under its belt, its inflation rate has since fallen to just 1.75% today. Yet in four short months, it will be reduced again and sit at a measly 0.875%. This process will continue until all 21 million coins are mined (more than a century from now), at which point Bitcoin will enter unprecedented territory.\n\nThe upcoming halving holds significant importance for many reasons, but the most compelling for investors is how it will alter the dynamics around supply and demand. Historically, some of Bitcoin's most impressive gains have come in the months after a halving as the market attempts to find a new equilibrium. With the passing of each halving, even if demand remains constant, the reduction in additional supply typically leads to an increase in prices as would-be buyers compete for fewer available bitcoins.\n\nBreaking down the long-term perspective\n\nThe first two points focused more on the short term to highlight how it isn't too late now to buy Bitcoin. But considering a more long-term perspective, I would entertain the notion that it might never be \"too late\" to buy Bitcoin.\n\nWhile short-term factors are essential to consider in your investment planning, when it comes to Bitcoin, this is a long-term game. More so than any other asset, Bitcoin rewards investors who have time frames of decades, not just months or years. The true power of Bitcoin comes when investors let the effects of multiple halvings compound. The longer one holds one's tokens, and the more halvings that pass, the greater the returns Bitcoin provides as new tokens become harder to create.\n\nYet, the most attractive reason for holding Bitcoin over the long term is that it is still early in its adoption. It is difficult to quantify accurately, but estimates suggest that around 15% of the world's population has adopted crypto so far. Add in additional drivers such as interest from financial institutions, the continuous debasement of fiat currencies, and general trends in cryptocurrency use among younger generations, and demand for those 21 million coins looks like it will come under even greater pressure.\n\nWhen considering Bitcoin from this perspective, its short-term jumps hold less significance, which should reduce some of the FOMO that often accompanies Bitcoin bull markets. There are plenty of tailwinds forming that should drive the price higher over the long term, making today a great time to buy Bitcoin."

        "content": "Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block Launches \u201cBitkey\u201d Self Custody Bitcoin Wallet\n\nFinancial payment processor Block, co-founded by Jack Dorsey, has unveiled its self-custody Bitcoin wallet called \"Bitkey.\" In an announcement on December 7, developers revealed that the wallet will be available as a mobile app or hardware storage and accessible in over 95 countries.\n\nBitkey features a two-of-three multi-signature wallet, which consists of a mobile key, a hardware key, and a server key. It incorporates a secure hardware device and recovery tools in case of loss. To approve transactions, users will need to authenticate with both their fingerprint and phone. Coinbase and Cash App are among the initial global partners for Bitkey.\n\nBlock emphasized that Bitkey employs three keys to secure Bitcoin, requiring any two keys to work together for moving Bitcoin or authorizing security-related actions like recovery or modifying settings. The wallet, operating in a 2-of-3 multi-signature framework, ensures that Bitkey cannot access or move a customer's Bitcoin without their participation.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, Block reported impressive financial results, recording $5.62 billion in revenue driven by strong sales growth from payment processors Cash App and Square. The company also achieved a $44 million profit on its Bitcoin investments, benefiting from the recent price recovery of BTC. Furthermore, Bitcoin transaction gross profit reached $45 million, a 22% increase year-over-year, with Block selling $2.42 billion worth of BTC to customers through Cash App.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "The crypto winter is thawing, and some of the biggest tokens on the market have come to life in just the past week. There wasn't any major news out from the industry, but there seems to be a very big mood shift happening across crypto.\n\nAccording to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Bitcoin (BTC -5.55%) is up 13.6%, Ethereum (ETH -5.99%) has gained 12.8%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 1.41%) has popped 20.2% over the past seven days. And there doesn't seem to be any end in sight to the momentum.\n\nIs the crypto winter over?\n\nThere have been a number of catalysts for the crypto market lately. The bullish move in the stock market has been a very \"risk-on\" move which has typically translated to cryptocurrencies moving higher as well.\n\nAirdrops, or giving away tokens to wallets on the blockchain, have also added hundreds of millions of dollars in liquidity to the market, and that's pushing the values of the better-known tokens higher.\n\nCrypto can be a very sentiment-driven market, and traders are seeing a lot of reasons to be bullish right now with institutions and individuals pouring money into crypto after nearly two years of money flowing out of the industry. On top of that, interest rates are falling and growth investors are getting more bullish, which correlated with the rise in crypto in 2021.\n\nMore work ahead\n\nFor the momentum to continue, crypto needs to develop more use cases and ways to generate value than just trading. That's being done in a lot of areas including payments and decentralized financial products. But many tokens and airdrops are simply riding the hype cycle without knowing where long-term value is going to come from.\n\nI think the current state of crypto looks a lot like the fear of missing out and \"you only live once\" trading that happened during the pandemic. But this time around the market is much more well known, and bigger institutions are starting to get involved.\n\nWhat investors should be wary of is the market crashing again if the economy slows down and interest rates don't come down as fast as expected. This crypto rally isn't necessarily built on a solid footing of improving regulations and improved use cases; it's more about speculation.\n\nWhile I'm bullish on the future of the blockchain, I don't think these moves in some cryptocurrencies are sustainable. Many tokens have little use other than trading, and their long-term prospects ultimately may end in values falling and investors losing their money. There are more established tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum that have proven to be stores of value or a place where there's development, but I wouldn't take the rise in altcoins as a sustainable jump. After a great week and an even better month, it may be time to take some gains in crypto."

Indeed, it brings to mind the decision this year by BlackRock, the world\u2019s top asset management firm, to seek approval for a Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded fund.\n\n\u201cThe entry of Ita\u00fa is a watershed moment for the sector in Brazil,\u201d Alexandre Vasarhelyi, founding partner at crypto investment firm BLP Crypto, told DL News.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nTraditional institutions are poised to dominate the market. In Brazil, banks such as Ita\u00fa, which are already authorised to operate by the central bank, can easily get approval to offer new crypto services.\n\n\u201cConsidering that these institutions already have a very high level of internal compliance, which makes them trustworthy among the general public, there is a possible scenario in which banks like Ita\u00fa and others could lead the crypto economy in Brazil,\u201d Daniel de Paiva Gomes, a partner at Brazilian law firm Vieira, Drigo e Vasconcellos, told DL News.\n\nPaying tax bills with crypto\n\nBrazilians have long been enamoured with crypto. Taxpayers in Rio de Janeiro can pay some of their bills to the city in crypto. And Brazil\u2019s crypto startup scene is bustling with activity.\n\nAlong with the US and Australia, Brazil, with a population of 214 million, is on course to have one of the world\u2019s highest crypto adoption rates, according to HedgewithCrypto study.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u2018Brazil, unlike other countries like the US, does not follow the \u2018regulation by enforcement\u2019 line.\u2019 \u2014 Daniel de Paiva Gomes\n\nNow Ita\u00fa's rollout of crypto services may spur Brazilian lawmakers to take a more supportive position on digital assets, said Helo Passos, founder and CEO of Brazilian blockchain gaming company Trexx.\n\n\u201cWith the effective entry of a banking giant like Ita\u00fa, the pressure on Congress will be even greater for next year\u2019s calendar to think in terms of regulation,\u201d she told DL News.\n\nNot that the government has done nothing. Brazil has already approved the type of tailored legislation US crypto leaders have been seeking in vain from Washington.\n\nIn December of last year, the Brazilian government approved the Legal Framework for Virtual Assets in Brazil, also known as the Cryptoassets Act.\n\nThe bill provides definitions for virtual assets and virtual asset service providers. \u201cA virtual asset is a digital representation of value that can be traded or transferred electronically and used to make payments or for investment purposes,\u201d the law says.\n\nIt also establishes new criminal penalties for operations involving fraud, money laundering, and organised crime.\n\nCentral Bank support\n\nMost importantly, the bill officially gives the central bank the authority to regulate the digital assets industry. And the institution\u2019s president, Roberto Campos Neto, is a defender of the sector.\n\nThe only exception is for crypto assets that are also securities, which fall under the jurisdiction of Brazil\u2019s Comiss\u00e3o de Valores Mobili\u00e1rios \u2014 CVM for short, the equivalent of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u201cBrazil, unlike other countries like the US, does not follow the \u2018regulation by enforcement\u2019 line,\u201d said de Paiva Gomes, the lawyer at Vieira. \u201cWe can say that regulators, such as the Central Bank and CVM, are attentive to the evolution of new technologies and are seeking to accommodate the regulatory framework.\u201d\n\nThanks to the CVM, Brazilian investment funds for the general public can now allocate up to 10% of their holdings into digital assets, shares of local crypto funds, offshore crypto funds, or offshore crypto exchange-traded products.\n\nThe catch: They must get their exposure from companies either registered with Brazil\u2019s central bank or with a regulatory body abroad.\n\nRegistered funds\n\nThis leaves Brazilian funds with little choice.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, only a handful of Brazilian institutions registered with the central bank were offering crypto asset services, according to a report in Valor Globo, the largest financial newspaper in Brazil.\n\nAnd internationally, Coinbase is one of the few registered international exchanges with enough liquidity to meet Brazilian investment fund demand.\n\nThis is where Ita\u00fa's crypto development may have an impact down the line.\n\nWhile the firm only offers retail Bitcoin and Ethereum trading services at the moment, Guto Antunes, Ita\u00fa's head of digital assets, told Reuters that the bank plans to expand its range of available currencies in the future.\n\n\u2018Ita\u00fa\u2019s move marks a movement towards the institutionalisation of the crypto economy.\u2019 \u2014 Daniel de Paiva Gomes\n\nIta\u00fa already provides crypto custody services and is working on tokenizing financial assets.\n\nIta\u00fa's move \u201cmarks a movement towards the institutionalisation of the crypto economy,\u201d said de Paiva Gomes.\n\nIta\u00fa Unibanco was born out of a merger between Banco Ita\u00fa and Unibanco \u2014 two of Brazil\u2019s oldest banks, founded in 1945 and 1924 respectively. The bank counted roughly $169 billion in assets under management in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, Ita\u00fa CEO Milton Maluhy Filho said that crypto was not a fad and that the bank was \u201cmonitoring the area of digital assets, using this technology for an increasingly tokenizable world.\u201d\n\nTom Carreras is DL News\u2019 correspondent in Latin America.

        "content": "If history is any guide, the crypto market is poised for a major rally in the months leading up to the next Bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving event. As we approach the new year, speculators could push up the prices of cryptocurrencies, benefiting traditional stocks with crypto exposure. In the past, crypto stocks appreciated in the months leading up and after Bitcoin halvings.\n\nThe first Bitcoin halving occurred in 2012 when mining rewards halved from 50 BTC per block to 25. In fact, the Bitcoin halving occurs in 4-year cycles to help maintain scarcity and counteract inflation by cutting miner rewards. Following the Bitcoin halving of 2024, the next cycle will see the block reward for miners fall from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving event is estimated to occur in April or May 2024. It presents a golden opportunity for savvy investors to capitalize on the likely appreciation of crypto stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo position a portfolio for maximum gains around the next Bitcoin halving, these three crypto stocks tied to blockchain technology are poised to reap the most rewards.\n\nRiot Blockchain (RIOT)\n\nIn this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the next Bitcoin halving approaches, efficiency will be the key to the drop in mining rewards from the Bitcoin halving. Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT), one of the largest crypto miners in the world, is leading the low-cost mining of Bitcoins.\n\nRIOT recently invested $162.9 million to triple its mining capacity ahead of the Bitcoin halving event. The company acquired 33,280 \u201cnext-generation\u201d Bitcoin miners in June and should be able to maintain and even increase its Bitcoin production.\n\nThe company mined 1,100 BTC in the third quarter, producing revenue of $51.9 million. At the time of reporting, it had around $290 million in cash, with over 7,300 BTC in its cryptocurrency wallets (worth around $275 million). RIOT even saw its adjusted EBITDA soaring 7-fold to $31.6 million from $4.3 million last year and is well-positioned to benefit from the upcoming halving.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoinbase (COIN)\n\nThe app for Coinbase (COIN) displayed on an iPhone screen.\n\nSource: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrypto exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) also tends to rally around the Bitcoin halving events. Although it doesn\u2019t mine BTC, it provides technology and financial infrastructure for the crypto economy. More specifically, it provides a marketplace and a liquidity pool to maintain crypto transactions for individuals and institutions.\n\nAs BTC rises before and after the Bitcoin halving, Coinbase\u2019s transaction fees, a percentage of trade volumes, should also increase. Since the company earns money on every trade, it implies higher revenue and profits, making Coinbase a smart crypto stock proxy play.\n\nThe company has $5.5 billion in cash, and in its third-quarter earnings report, it raised its outlook for adjusted EBITDA for the full year. Its net revenue saw sustained growth over the last year, rising from $576 million to $623 million in the third quarter.\n\nInteractive Brokers (IBKR)\n\nFuturistic stock exchange (cryptocurrency) with chart, numbers and BUY and SELL options (3D illustration). Under-the-Radar Cryptos\n\nSource: 0pen / Shutterstock.com\n\nInteractive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) is a global broker providing trading and exchange accounts for clients with exposure to cryptocurrencies. However, it also has its own futures trading desk to supply crypto derivatives to clients. Besides Bitcoin, the company provides financial services for other markets. Its diversified portfolio isn\u2019t exclusively reliant on cryptocurrencies, making it a solid defensive play.\n\nAdditionally, IBKR launched a new product last year to allow customers to custody cryptocurrencies. And the company offered it in integration with traditional financial instruments in a single account. This innovative offering makes it simpler and more convenient for investors to gain cryptocurrency exposure. So, when the next wave of adoption begins, it should attract greater interest to IBKR\u2019s platform.\n\nIBRK trades at a P/E ratio of 28.8x, with a forward dividend yield of 0.5% and a market capitalization of $34.1 billion. Its latest report showed that it had $404 billion in client equity, up 27% from last year. Additionally, the company increased the number of clients holding accounts by 21% to 2.4 million last quarter, suggesting continued growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The European Central Bank (ECB) published a working paper exploring the popularity of Bitcoin in emerging economies. It found speculation impacts cryptocurrency prices worldwide. However, in emerging economies, the instability of the local fiat currency is an additional driver of demand. Despite the price volatility, Bitcoin may be viewed as a store of value by those holding unstable local currencies.\n\nFluctuating advanced economy currencies did not impact cryptocurrency activity. For example, during the period the Australian Dollar, British Pound and Japanese Yen were relatively unstable, but didn\u2019t impact crypto demand.\n\nThe research also found that Bitcoin is used for payment transactions in some emerging economies. That\u2019s particularly true for cross border payments where economies have capital controls or for receiving remittances at a lower cost. Our own cursory analysis below indicates remittances could be a major factor.\n\nAdditionally, the research found a correlation in payment usage in countries that have underdeveloped traditional finance systems. Plus countries with younger, less risk averse populations also use Bitcoin more.\n\nRather than basing conclusions on anecdotal evidence, it looked at transactions against Bitcoin in local currencies. It used off-chain data from popular P2P exchanges rather than cryptocurrency exchanges which are more likely to have wash trades.\n\nThe IMF previously expressed concerns regarding the potential of cryptocurrency to impact economies with volatile countries and as a means to circumvent controls. In 2019, 90% of IMF member countries had capital controls.\n\n\u201cOur findings clearly point to potential financial stability risks in EMDEs with low levels of financial development and unstable fiat currencies,\u201d the ECB report concludes. It notes that the price volatility of Bitcoin could discourage some, but stablecoins based on reserve currencies might become more widely used.\n\nA crossover with remittances?\n\nGiven two of the key drivers are unstable currencies and the need for cross border remittances, in our view, it is worthwhile determining which is a bigger influence. That\u2019s because the G20 is trying to address remittance costs, whereas volatile currencies are a far trickier issue.\n\nA quick (admittedly cursory) analysis indicates that remittances could be a major factor. Four of the top eight economies with the most inbound remittances are in the top ten for crypto. Regarding local fiat currency instability, only one of the top ten most volatile jurisdictions appears on the list. However, if you look further down the list, several others are big crypto users.\n\nChainalysis ranked countries in terms of cryptocurrency adoption. The top ten are:\n\nIndia Nigeria Vietnam USA Ukraine Philippines Indonesia Pakistan Brazil Thailand\n\nAccording to World Bank research, these are the top eight countries for inbound remittances:\n\nBelow is data on fiat currency volatility from the ECB report:\n\n\n\nThe ECB research\u2019s findings were particularly during and post COVID, when migrant workers may have been stuck offshore.\n\n\n\nMexico has both a volatile currency and considerable inbound remittances. Yet it only ranks in 16th spot on the Chainalysis list. There are two potential explanations. Firstly, crypto is banned, similar to 11th-ranked China. Secondly, while Mexico is not considered dollarized, the U.S. dollar is widely used, so there is an alternative store of value and medium of exchange."

        "content": "In our Chart of the Week, we compare the performance of the oldest and best-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, with the performance of the S&P 500. Over the last 10 years, Bitcoin has outperformed the S&P 500 close to 2,200-fold.[3] At the same time, Bitcoin's returns have been notoriously volatile, which is perhaps unsurprising, given its evolving ecosystem, the wide range of plausible scenarios for future applications of Bitcoin and the still unfolding potential of its underlying blockchain technology.[4] Thus, Bitcoin's outperformance appears less impressive on a risk-adjusted basis.\n\nEspecially noteworthy in the chart is the rolling last 12-month correlation between daily Bitcoin returns and equity returns. As can be seen in the chart, the correlation sharply fluctuated around a low level of less than 0.2 for most of the observation period. Investors were therefore able to cushion price fluctuations in equities by investing in bitcoin and, perhaps more importantly, vice versa. Only since the start of the Covid pandemic has there been a clear trend break. Since then, the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 has risen significantly. Reasons for the increasing correlation between equities and cryptocurrencies could partly lie in the increasing adoption by retail and institutional investors that gained access to the young asset class via for example crypto trading platforms and crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs).[5] However, it would be premature to read too much into the tighter correlations post pandemic, not least given recent declines. We believe that the main reason for the spike in correlation is simply the sharp fall in all risky assets during the covid pandemic. It is a well-known feature of markets that correlations spike in times of turmoil.[6]"

        "title": "Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin Reaching $45K Explains Key Drivers Behind Latest Bull Run - CoinDesk",
        "content": "The state of crypto is presented by Tron connecting the world to the power of Cryptocurrency. Matrix Sport anticipates Bitcoin climbing up to $63,000 by April 2024. Why should you care? Well, a month ago, they predicted Bitcoin would hit $45,000. Guess where it is? Yeah, it hit that just a couple of days ago. Joining us now to discuss the next move in crypto is Matrix Support, head of research and strategy, Marcus Sten. Welcome back, Marcus. Thanks for having me. Glad to see you again. So as as I said, a month ago, you said $45,000 was imminent. You weren't kidding? And I was skeptical. So I think we all were Marcus. Yeah, I was like, ok, yeah, that's, that's all right. Have fun with that Marcus. And sure enough here we are 4040 change, we hit 45,000. Um What do you think is driving this bull run? Um And don't just say I told you so because you told us so, but also what's the underlying factors in this latest bull run? Well, when you look at February 1st, there's actually a a coin desk article where we already predicted by December this year 45,000. So we have been working with this 45,000 level for literally the whole year. But you know, this year we have seen actually four legs or five legs with the latest one of this bull market, right? The first one started in January based on lower inflation numbers. Uh The second one was in March. On the one side, we got, of course, the three banks that were dismantled. Bitcoin is a new financial system basically. Uh We also had, of course, b using moving a lot of B US D into Bitcoin during this time. Then of course, in June, we had the Blackrock announcement about the potential ETF F. And then I think what people, what a lot of people missed actually in October, we had then a 50 60% rally on the back of power actually started to turn do. And I think this was actually a big trigger. Um It was only really like the last 23 weeks where people became more confident about the Bitcoin ETF potentially being approved in January. Um But I think it was actually in, in October when Fetcher Powell turned Dovish that we started to have a, a monster rally and we were just really pushing the market. And, you know, we were on top of this. And last time we spoke, you know, we also talked about the miners, the miners are exploding. So we are really happy right now. So, so you, you mentioned the B US D to Bitcoin rally and we of course, saw this uh settlement now with uh finance and the US government which uh would cause CZ to uh spend uh uh uh a few days uh getting three hots and a cot from, from the federal government. So, um did that have any, did that play any factor? Do we know of anything uh in terms of movements involving B into in and the price of Bitcoin? Uh ha has there been any linkage if you will in this latest rally? Some, some people try to argue this way. I mean, I doubt it. I don't think there's anybody out there who has been like sitting on the sidelines and waiting until basically the, you know, the US government goes after Binance. I don't think this was the trigger. I mean, the only positive news there was that people expected something like 6 to 10 billion uh fines or 4 billion. Sounds a lot more positive. But I think the key thing that, that I didn't hear anybody talking about is that since, since October, we have seen $7 billion of uh new market cap in US CT and tethers. So this just shows there is a large investor or large investors, institutional investors are sending money to tether, minting tether and really moving money probably from US dollar into crypto and I think that's a big driver. This is like $7 billion of fresh money that's coming in. That's, you know, much bigger than ETP, that, you know, people try to quote or name. Um, so, yeah, so I don't think that's, that's the driver. I think the driver is something else. Well, where, where is that source of tether? Where is it coming from? Obviously, Tether is notorious about its opaqueness. But do we have any sense of what drove that amount of money going into tether? Which I mean, let's be honest, is barely redeemable if at all, unless you are, I don't know, Saman man freed uh who apparently had some ability to do some redeeming. But other than that, why did we have those purchases of tether? It doesn't say that's not a US gov that's not a US institutional play. Well, on the one side, you know, we have a lot of struggles still in China. And as you might know that uh you know, the most tethers being issued are actually on throne, not on this year. So and Tron is of course, you know, to some extent linked to emerging markets linked to China. You know, we we have heard of course the property uh vo still continue in China, you know, gold prices are also going up, which is also probably linked to China. The PB OC has been really starting to buy gold over the last three or four months. So we would assume that's probably, you know, the population also starts to buy gold and probably other assets as well. So I would really think, uh you know, you look at the market cap of tether, which started to really, really since uh since Powell's speech. So I think there is somebody believing in the market that this Darvish flip really that you have seen from the central bank is really driving a lot of asset inflows. And you know, Bitcoin is a key beneficiary here, but it could, it, I mean, it's not internal issues going on in China for instance, or, or what have you uh people trying to get money out and uh you know, we we we do know of some, let's just say questionable movements in the past involving China and uh and funds and tether. Yeah, of course, we don't know. Right. We don't know, but we know that the market cap is going up. We also know a lot of other historical analysis. For example, when the, when the CME listed the Bitcoin futures in 2017, from the moment they announced it until the futures were actually listed. Bitcoin went up 180%. So, you know, we can assume that the market uh you know, uh the animal spirits are really taking over now where people are kind of just really trying to front from this part as well. But I think it's really like the mixture of really, you know, positive news from the central bank. You know, a lot of money suddenly becoming, you know, free and going into crypto. Uh and I think this is something really happening under the hood without people really noticing it. Marcus. We uh we got to get your comments on this clip. Everyone's talking about Jamie Dimond JP Morgan Chase CEO and chairman. He was on Capitol Hill yesterday talking about Bitcoin. Let's take a listen. I've always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin et cetera. You pointed out the only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, antimo laundering, tax avoidance. And that is a use case uh because it is somewhat anonymous, not fully and because you can move money instantaneously and because it doesn't go through, as you mentioned, all these systems have built up over many years. No, your customers sanctions. Of fact, it's didn't get bypass all of that. I, if I was the government's, I'd close it down. All right, Marcus, we have those comments from Jamie Dimond that's up against uh massive asset managers like black rock racing towards the spot. Bitcoin ETF. What do you make of that? Well, I think it's a, it's a comment from the past, right? I mean, this comment we have heard, you know, 5678 years ago already, you know, from, from Jamie Diamond, you know, we know that JP Morgan internally has been active on crypto the last kind of like, you know, 67 years, really, they have their own crypto internal team. So, you know, I think that the banks are trying to just fight a little bit back here, but I think it's still that this universe is getting like bigger and bigger. And I think we just have to see how crypto develops. Now. Just before we wrap, we got to talk about matrix ports predictions for next year. Since your 2023 predictions have kind of come in spot on. We have a chart here from your latest report that shows Bitcoin hitting 100 and $25,000. Talk to us about what factors went into uh this prediction. Why are we expecting it to hit 125 next year? Yeah. So the 30 the 63,000 target is actually from last year end of October, which is like the myth having low and then the projection, you know how it's like played out. And this really put us on a really bullish map this year. Um You know, the other factor is that um in, in June this year, we had the one year new high making for the first time in a year. And historically, we have seen like a 300% increase from there, you know, from that moment on. But also when you look at the, the three halving years, 2012, 2016, 2020 the average return is 200%. So where we are right now, you know, around like 40,000 or 45,000. I think you could really project another, you know, uh 200% from here, which would get us to 100 and 20,000. I know it sounds quite optimistic, but I think, uh we'd be probably gonna make our move towards 100,000 next year, for sure. All right, Marcus, I think there's a lot of people watching that are really hoping that prediction comes true. Thanks so much for joining us. It's always a pleasure having you on the show and happy holidays. Thank you. You too. That was Matrix four, head of research and strategy. Marcus Thin."

        "title": "What the Bitcoin Halving Means for Investors - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving is fast approaching. And though this seismic event has happened three times before, and it's been baked into Bitcoin's code since birth, it once again has observers wondering: What does that mean for me?\n\nThe halving is first and foremost an important event for Bitcoin miners, who will see the fruits of their labor slashed in half once again. But it also has meaning for BTC investors\u2014if for no other reason than market sentiment and the attention that the halving typically brings.\n\n\u201cThe halving hype is loud and big because people listen and only that\u2014this halving has more people listening,\u201d Scott Norris, co-founder of Bitcoin miner LSJ Ops, told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo what does the Bitcoin halving really mean for retail traders? Should they be paying attention?\n\nBitcoin halving: the nuts and bolts\n\nAfter the next Bitcoin halving, which should take place next April, miners will be rewarded with 3.125 BTC for each block they process. That's half the current rate of 6.25 BTC. The reason for this is to keep Bitcoin inflation in check.\n\nThere will only ever be 21 million BTC minted, but the rate at which new coins are created is slowed down every four years.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to predict the exact date of the halving because it\u2019s scheduled to occur once per 210,000 blocks mined. The rate at which new Bitcoin is mined fluctuates depending on network activity.\n\nBut other than the amount of BTC being rewarded to miners changing, some say this halving will be different from previous ones\u2014simply because more people are now talking about it. There's more interest today in the cryptocurrency industry\u2014especially from institutions\u2014than ever before.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince Bitcoin\u2019s last halving back in 2020, a lot has happened. The price of the biggest digital asset is now more than four times what it was ahead of the last halving; the coin went on a massive bull run in 2021 when it touched its all-time high of $69,044, before dropping down again. Bitcoin has also become far more mainstream and big money from traditional and respected firms has poured in.\n\nThe last three halvings have led to a price surge following the event: Before the first halving of 2012, BTC was priced at $12.35; one year later the price of the coin stood at $964.\n\nThe next halving on July 9, 2016, BTC was trading hands for $663. Again, one year later, it had shot up in value and was priced at $2,500.\n\nAnd at the latest halving, which took place on May 11, 2020, BTC was valued at $8,500. A bull run followed the next year and the biggest digital coin exploded to an all-time high the next year.\n\nFor that reason, retail investors\u2014and not just miners\u2014should be paying attention to the next halving, industry insiders say. \u201cThere are more people focused on Bitcoin now, more people building on Bitcoin now than ever before,\u201d Bob Bodily, CEO of Ordinals marketplace Bioniq, told Decrypt.\n\nBodily added that the halving mixed in with a potential approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), interest from venture capitalists, and developers building on the blockchain could lead to the \u201ccraziest bull run of all time.\u201d\n\nHyperbole? Maybe, but those predictions are supported from even the likes of British multinational Standard Chartered. The bank's analysts say they expect the combination of miner rewards getting cut in half plus the potential approval of an ETF could lead to Bitcoin hitting $100,000 per coin next year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps the biggest Bitcoin bull of them all, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, has also said the halving combined with the potential approval of several Bitcoin ETFs could lead to a flood of money into the market like never before. And he's put his money where his mouth is: MicroStrategy now holds $6.6 billion in Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin halving: what does it mean for BTC price?\n\nDoes that mean retail investors will come rushing in as the halving draws closer? Bitcoin fans don't need any further convincing, says Bodily. They're likely to keep buying. But for traditional investors who haven't yet stepped into crypto, the play might not be as obvious, given the associated risks.\n\nBitcoin is a notoriously volatile asset, and the relatively illiquid market\u2014when compared to traditional stock assets\u2014is prone to wild swings. An ETF should help stabilize things, analysts say, if it is indeed approved for trading and large amounts of capital enter the market as they expect. But mom and pop retail buyers might still be hesitant, given the events of the last year.\n\nBitcoin crashed spectacularly after peaking at an all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021. A number of factors contributed to its fall, including the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, the contagion that spread throughout the industry, and macroeconomic shifts like the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates to record levels as inflation soared.\n\nThe digital asset then hit a multi-year low of around $15,000 a year later following the implosion of FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried\u2014a saga that only recently reached its climax after the former billionaire was convicted of multiple federal crimes. Lawmakers and regulators are now more closely scrutinizing crypto markets, so it's reasonable to think that your typical Fidelity client might be apprehensive about diving back into crypto.\n\nShort of an ETF, more traditional investors can still gain exposure to Bitcoin through proxies such as publicly traded mining companies. Nishant Sharma, founder of Bitcoin mining industry public relations firm BlocksBridge Consulting, told Decrypt that investors who want to get exposure to mining company stocks should pay attention to metrics that tell how efficient and reliable a mining company\u2019s operations are.\n\n\u201cAn example of such a metric is the hash rate realization of a company, which shows how much of a company\u2019s installed hash rate was used by it to mine bitcoin in the past month,\u201d he said. \u201cBy checking the [hash rate] of a company over the past year or more, one can also get an idea of the company\u2019s softer aspects that cannot be measured, such as, the foresight of a company to plan for regulatory or environmental disruptions, etc.\u201d\n\nStill, when it comes to how investors should consider the Bitcoin halving, not everyone is convinced that the event has a bullish effect on BTC's price necessarily, despite how previous halvings have played out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no proof it has an effect on price,\u201d Scott Norris, co-founder of Bitcoin miner LSJ Ops, told Decrypt. But it's \u201cgreat for hype,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hype machine loves it and it sparks the FOMO [fear of missing out].\"\n\nLong-time pseudonymous contributor to Bitcoin privacy wallet Wasabi, who goes by the name Rafe, said that the halving is \u201ca known change\u201d but traditional investors who aren\u2019t yet \u201cdeep in the Bitcoin rabbit hole\u201d will take more note of this one.\n\nMost of all, it\u2019s likely that the halving will be what it\u2019s always been: an event for miners. With Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate higher than ever, miners are having to work harder\u2014and this could put some out of the business altogether. For that reason, those minting the coins are the ones who will be closely watching next year\u2019s event.\n\nEdited by Stacy Elliott."

        "title": "BRC-20 tokens are presenting new opportunities for Bitcoin buyers - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "As the first blockchain and cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) paved the way for everything that\u2019s come since: nonfungible tokens (NFTs), smart contracts, tokenization, layer-2 solutions, and all the rest. Due to Bitcoin\u2019s value to the cryptosphere, forming the bedrock that supports the rest of the market, its protocol is rarely altered. With hundreds of billions of dollars and global trust in the decentralized network at stake, it doesn\u2019t make sense to meddle.f\n\nWhile the ossification of Bitcoin\u2019s codebase has brought stability and reliability, it\u2019s made Bitcoin a little\u2026 well, boring. Where once the Bitcoin ecosystem formed a hub of innovation and a hive of activity, that momentum has shifted to second- and third-generation chains whose architecture is better suited to supporting multiple use cases and applications. At least that was the case until the emergence of Ordinals, a technology that has sparked a new wave of innovation on Bitcoin.\n\nThroughout 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem developed rapidly. Emerging asset types, exemplified by Ordinals NFTs and BRC-20 tokens, have sparked widespread community enthusiasm, leading to a substantial increase in BTC miners' earnings.\n\nRelated: Expect some crypto companies to fail in the wake of Bitcoin's halving\n\nNow, tokens can be issued on the Bitcoin network by projects whose very security is anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain. And the best part? Ordinals haven't required changing a single line in Bitcoin\u2019s code. Furthermore, the BRC-20 standards are evolving rapidly, positioning them to become an indispensable new element within the BTC ecosystem in the future.\n\nOne coin spawns many tokens\n\nOrdinals is a protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Each Bitcoin can be broken down into 100 million units, known as sats. Each of these sats can be given a unique identifier using Ordinals and transferred over the Bitcoin network with this data attached. The Ordinals concept, developed by Casey Rodarmor, has proven phenomenally successful. It's opened the floodgates to a wave of Bitcoin-based NFTs. Because of it, a virtually infinite number of tokens can now be traded on Bitcoin.\n\nTrends in the $1.4 billion BRC-20 market as of Dec. 7, 2023. Source: CoinGecko\n\nAt first, Ordinals were latched onto by tech-minded Bitcoiners who could meet the high bar for minting and trading them. The process, after all, requires sending a sat to a Taproot-compatible wallet and inscribing metadata with the transaction. Initially, this required running a Bitcoin node and having familiarity with a command line interface, but code-free solutions have since emerged and have been responsible for mainstreaming Ordinals, particularly for the benefit of the Ethereum community.\n\nNFTs were the first use case for the Ordinals protocol, but the same technology can be used to issue fungible tokens, similar to the ERC-20 tokens that Ethereum supports. In fact, the token standard that\u2019s emerged for these Bitcoin-native assets even bears the same naming structure: BRC-20.\n\nAlready, there are BRC-20 projects springing up with Bitcoin-based tokens, forming a fledgling tokenized ecosystem that\u2019s coalescing around Bitcoin and Ordinals. Several of these tokens have captured the market\u2019s imagination, finding their way to tier-1 exchanges and spreading the word about the BRC-20 takeover in the process.\n\nFrom sats to SATS\n\nMany of the communities that have formed around Ordinals and Bitcoin are focused on fun, first and foremost. Gaming, collecting, speculating, socializing and interacting ahead of serious stuff like enterprise or institutional usage. $SATS is the perfect case in point. Bitcoin\u2019s very own memecoin, SATS is naturally a BRC-20 token, but it\u2019s also so much more.\n\nDaily Ordinal inscriptions by type from the day the first Ordinal was minted on Dec. 14, 2022, through Feb. 24, 2023. Source: Chainlink\n\nA total supply of 2,100,000,000,000,000 means $SATS is literally the Bitcoin supply times 100 million. In other words, there\u2019s a SAT for every sat. Projects like this may not be changing the world, but they\u2019re making Bitcoin fun again, and in the process, educating newcomers on key characteristics that are enshrined in Bitcoin\u2019s architecture.\n\nOther BRC-20 tokens have also carved out market share while bolstering the case for Ordinals on Bitcoin. The combined market capitalization of all BRC-20 tokens stands a little higher than $1.4 billion as of Dec. 7 \u2014 most of which can be attributed to ORDI \u2014 which suggests there is still plenty of room for growth.\n\nTaproot made tokens possible\n\nThe idea of issuing tokens on the Bitcoin network can\u2019t be found in the Bitcoin whitepaper: that use case hadn\u2019t been envisioned in 2008. In fact, it wasn\u2019t even possible to do so back then. It was not until the Taproot upgrade, which went live on the Bitcoin network in November 2021, that this became possible. Ordinals sprung up three months later, and the NFTs it spawned have been followed by an assortment of BRC-20 token projects.\n\nTaproot allows data to be added to block space, providing a means of minting tokens on Bitcoin. A single satoshi is minted and information concerning an entire set of fungible tokens is attached. This is done using JSON data where the token\u2019s name, ticker, supply and like qualities are added. Despite sharing the same naming structure as ERC-20, it\u2019s clear that BRC-20 tokens work very differently. This isn\u2019t surprising given that they are, technically, a workaround for a network that wasn\u2019t designed to support tokens.\n\nWhile the architecture may be unorthodox, the net result is the same. Just as communities formed around shared tokens and shared interests following the launch of Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token standard, something similar is occurring on Bitcoin. BRC-20s aren\u2019t beloved by all Bitcoiners, it should be noted: some take exception to the block space the tokens take up, which can cause fees to spike. Others simply aren\u2019t interested in anything that isn\u2019t pure BTC.\n\nLook to the future\n\nWhen Ethereum launched, it had the ability to support a rich and diverse ecosystem of token-based projects \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what it did eventually. It took time for the communities to form and tooling to be built out, however. Bitcoin and the BRC-20 standard are currently where Ethereum was in 2017: full of potential that has yet to be realized.\n\nRelated: 3 theses that will drive Ethereum and Bitcoin in the next bull market\n\nKey infrastructure connecting Bitcoin tokenization to the EVM chains is being completed, with MultiBit the latest project to make headway here, launching a two-way bridge for BRC-20 and ERC-20 transfers. 12 months from now, what will the BRC-20 landscape resemble, and what opportunities will it have delivered to those bold enough to have gotten in early? The surge of ERC-20 tokens and ICOs in 2017 propelled Ether\u2019s (ETH) price thirtyfold within a year. While current market dynamics are different, the prospect of Bitcoin replicating Ethereum\u2019s success remains promising.\n\nFor a growing band of supporters who are tired of what they perceive as stagnation on Ethereum and who don\u2019t quite fit in with Bitcoin maximalists, Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens have made crypto fun again. To them, the movement represents a return to Bitcoin\u2019s experimental, creative roots. If there\u2019s a chance to make some money along the way, while advancing their understanding of Bitcoin and spreading memes into the bargain, all the better.\n\nGracy Chen is the managing director of the crypto derivatives exchange Bitget, where she oversees market expansion, business strategy, and corporate development.

        "title": "Bitcoin's many deaths: Is crypto market past 'point of no return?' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have been gleefully declared dead more than a few times during bear markets, but some experts say it would take a genuinely extreme set of events for it to truly die.\n\nAccording to 99Bitcoins \u2014 a website that, among other things, tracks how many times Bitcoin (BTC) has been declared dead by mainstream media outlets \u2014 the largest crypto by market cap has died 474 times since 2010.\n\nOften, the proclamation is met with cheering by crypto skeptics as evidence that BTC is not a viable asset, but it might not be so simple to kill off crypto \u2014 at least according to some experts in the space.\n\nA year ago #Bitcoin hit $69,000. One of the main reason for the spectacular rally was all the leverage that funded unprecedented #crypto advertising and speculative buying. The #FTX bankruptcy proves the entire rally was a fraud. It will never be repeated. Bitcoin mania is over. \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 11, 2022\n\nTomasz Wojewoda, head of business development at BNB Chain, is confident it would take more than a bear market or crypto winter to end BTC and the crypto market, even though it\u2019s been a particularly harsh downswing since the all-time highs of 2021.\n\nA bear market is when the value of crypto has fallen by at least 20% and continues to fall, while a crypto winter is a prolonged period of depressed asset prices in the market.\n\nWojewoda told Cointelegraph that, in his opinion, the only way BTC and the broader crypto market could die would be if something extreme happened, such as the underlying community losing interest and everyone exiting the space at once.\n\nHowever, he doesn\u2019t see this happening anytime soon. Regardless of fiascos like the FTX saga and other dramas in the space, Wojewoda believes there is always \u201cgoing to be demand for crypto.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe crypto market, like any market in the economy, moves in waves and trends upward or downward depending on market sentiment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market has been through multiple bear markets, but historically, we have seen the market recover from similar trends.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, 2013, 2017 and 2021, crypto saw huge spikes in value, only to come crashing back down to earth. So far, after each crash, the price has recovered years down the road.\n\nOverall, this bear market and crypto winter has been particularly savage. After reaching highs of over $69,000 in 2021, BTC lost more than 60% of its value in 2022, according to CoinGecko. As of 2023, it has recovered some, but BTC is still roughly 40% down since its all-time highs.\n\nAccording to Wojewoda, challenging times like these \u201ccan actually be positive for the industry\u201d and not a sign that crypto is dying, even though it may feel like it. Specifically, he thinks market crashes can help weed out bad actors.\n\nRelated: Security audits \u2018not enough\u2019 as losses reach $1.5B in 2023, security professional says\n\nHe also sees it as a time when \u201cstrong projects focus on building and improving the user experience.\u201d\n\nRegulation won\u2019t kill crypto\n\nBanking regulators appear to be trying to kill or dismantle the crypto industry, brandishing an array of lawsuits and an intimidating flood of regulatory measures. There are fears this could spell doom for the industry.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Chair Gary Gensler, has been particularly aggressive against crypto firms. According to Gensler, his agency has filed over 780 enforcement actions in 2023, including over 500 standalone cases.\n\n1/ Today Coinbase received a Wells notice from the SEC focused on staking and asset listings. A Wells notice typically precedes an enforcement action. \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) March 22, 2023\n\nCrypto and BTC have survived, though. Regulations have been slow to come and, in some cases, poorly created. Wojewoda thinks some form of regulation can ultimately be a good thing for the industry and will not be the reason it dies.\n\n\u201cGlobal regulations can impact the growth of crypto; however, with more countries embracing crypto worldwide, I don\u2019t think this will be a reason for crypto to \u2018die off,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRegulation in the industry is a good thing. It keeps users safe, and a clear framework enables the industry to build around it.\u201d\n\nSome crypto will probably die, but the industry will survive\n\nWojewoda is convinced the crypto market will reach the other side of this crypto winter and beyond. He thinks it will likely survive as a concept, but not all projects and currencies will make it long-term.\n\nAccording to Exploding Topics, there are over 10,500 different cryptocurrencies in existence as of November 2023. However, it\u2019s estimated that only 8,848 are still active in the space, with the others dropping off or dying.\n\n\u201cProjects that didn\u2019t have a real-life use case died off, but the ones that truly make an impact have not only survived but thrived,\u201d Wojewoda said.\n\n\u201cThere are many things that can impact the trajectory of crypto, such as sentiment, regulation and other factors \u2014 for example, the Bitcoin ETF filing and upcoming Bitcoin halving,\u201d he added.\n\nNew Research note from me today. We still believe 90% chance by Jan 10 for spot #Bitcoin ETF approvals. But if it comes earlier we are entering a window where a wave of approval orders for all the current applicants *COULD* occur pic.twitter.com/u6dBva1ytD \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 8, 2023\n\nIn the long run, along with weaker hands dropping off, Wojewoda believes it\u2019s not \u201cout of the realm of possibility\u201d that some crypto will be replaced by new, better tech.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t think BTC will be among the casualties because its network effect and user base give it a significant advantage over other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cBitcoin will likely remain as the most popular crypto in terms of market share. Where I think we will likely see more movement in the ranks is among cryptocurrencies that offer real-world applications,\u201d Wojewoda said.\n\n\u201cThese projects have applications beyond digital currencies, and the tech is continuously evolving, finding new use cases and applications for the real world.\u201d\n\nRelated: Massive\u2019 crypto use cases to surface by 2030\n\nThese applications are one of the reasons Wojewoda thinks the market will endure long term. While not all will make it, the broader crypto market and BTC will survive.\n\nThe market will bounce back, with BTC still standing\n\nMarkus Thielen, head of research and strategy for digital asset investment firm Matrixport, is also skeptical that a bear market or crypto winter poses a genuine threat to the crypto market and BTC.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Thielen said that while many people exit the space during bear markets, it\u2019s a normal part of the process, not a sign of crypto\u2019s impending death.\n\n\u201cMany people have excited the crypto industry during the last year, as those firms have expanded near the top of the last bull market,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWithout sufficient revenues and additional capital injections from venture capital funds, those crypto firms have to right-size their companies.\u201d\n\nRight-sizing a company is the process of restructuring to make profits more efficiently and meet updated business objectives. Right-sizing usually involves reducing workforces, shifting around upper management and other cost-cutting measures.\n\n\u201cAs long as there is value being sent around electronically, crypto has a value proposition that is difficult to match with the traditional banking rails,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nSo far, there have been four bull markets \u2014 2011, 2013, 2017 and 2021 \u2014 and record numbers of people have entered the space each time, only to disappear when the bears strike. A bull market is characterized by rising prices and investor optimism.\n\nRelated: \u2018Strap yourselves in\u2019 \u2014 Bull market coming early 2024, say crypto exchange heads\n\nAccording to Thielen, each bull market is being built upon a new narrative, which will continue to be the case. He says there will likely be another narrative for a fifth bull market very soon.\n\n\u201cWith regulators approving Bitcoin futures in 2017 and potentially a Bitcoin ETF in 2024, the regulatory level playing field is cemented,\u201d Thielen said.\n\n\u201cI can not imagine Bitcoin ever disappearing, as the idea of Bitcoin plays into the hands of human fallacy.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is lining up an \u201cearly bull market\u201d as a unique chart feature plays out for the first time in history.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Dec. 7, entrepreneur Alistair Milne drew attention to Bitcoin\u2019s first ever weekly golden cross.\n\nBitcoin goes from death cross to golden cross in 10 months\n\nRecent BTC price upside has delivered considerable profits to various Bitcoin investor cohorts, but 165% year-to-date gains are now significant for another reason.\n\nShould current performance continue, Bitcoin will witness a crossover of two weekly moving averages (MAs), which have never delivered such a bull signal before.\n\nThe 50-week and 200-week MAs are key trendlines for Bitcoin traders and analysts alike. The latter is the ultimate bear market support level, and it has so far never decreased in value.\n\nThe 200-week MA made headlines earlier this year when the spot price fell below it in an unprecedented move.\n\nNow back above, BTC price strength is on the way to taking the 50-week MA trendline above the 200-week counterpart. Known as a \u201cgolden cross,\u201d on lower timeframes, this is considered a classic bullish signal, and for Milne, the impetus is that considerable upside could be in store should the phenomenon play out.\n\n\u201cThis bear market was the \u2018worst\u2019 in that we spent time under the 200-week moving average price (red) for the 1st time in Bitcoin\u2019s history,\u201d he commented.\n\n\u201cThe 50-week moving average will now soon cross back above the 200-week MA making a \u2018golden cross\u2019 for the 1st time. QED: Early bull market.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD 1-week chart with 50, 200MA. Source: TradingView\n\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView suggests that BTC/USD could even achieve the weekly golden cross before the end of 2023.\n\nBearish BTC price predictions endure\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, not every popular market commentator is bullish on Bitcoin after its swift march to $44,000 this week.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin HODL Waves: 2020 bull market buyers now control 16% of supply\n\nSome believe that buyer momentum is exhausted and that powerful, large-volume sellers are still able to drive the market significantly lower.\n\nAmong them is popular trader Crypto Chase, who revealed a short BTC position as Bitcoin crossed $43,000. What comes next, he warned, could involve a trip all the way to the low $20,000 range.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not changed bias. I\u2019m still bearish from the 40\u2019s looking for low 30\u2019s or even low 20\u2019s before new ATH\u2019s, and that\u2019s where I\u2019m at atm,\u201d part of X analysis read on the day.\n\nCrypto Chase added that only a move to new all-time highs, or ATHs, would change the prognosis, but that he \u201cdid not believe\u201d this to be on the way.\n\nHe is not alone. Still holding firm on this even more bearish BTC price prediction is controversial trader Il Capo of Crypto, who maintains that $12,000 is Bitcoin\u2019s true bottom target.\n\nIn a post to Telegram channel subscribers on Dec. 1, he called for a \u201cbig dump to $30k\u201331k with altcoins dumping about 30\u201340%.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be the beginning of the capitulation event,\u201d he claimed.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "As of early Friday morning, this week was shaping up to be a banner one for altcoins. Among many others, integration cryptocurrency Polkadot (DOT -1.90%) had advanced by 13% week to date by that point, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nMeanwhile, a pair of alternates to the top two coins -- Ethereum Classic (ETC -6.41%) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC -5.63%) -- also came along for the ride, S&P Global Market Intelligence figures reveal. The former was up 16%, while the latter had advanced by 12%.\n\nMany cryptos continued their sprint\n\nCryptocurrencies remain in the throes of a major and sustained rally. It just so happens that the dominant one, Bitcoin of course, seemed to be taking a pause by the end of the week. It dipped a little in price after hitting a recent peak of a hard-to-believe $45,000 on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThat was like the lead runner in a race slowing a bit to conserve energy. As Bitcoin cooled (along with its cousin Wrapped Bitcoin, which sits on the Ethereum blockchain), investment money found its way into other coins and tokens and they surged ahead.\n\nEthereum was one beneficiary, hence the pop in its origin blockchain Ethereum Classic. Polkadot, which has won kudos for the blockchain interoperability it facilitates, was another.\n\nThere was little material reason for the Bitcoin pause; it's likely that profit-taking was among the factors. Yet optimism abounds. Recent employment statistics are heating up speculation that the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates before long, reversing its recent habit. This compounds steeper-than-expected declines in inflation data.\n\nThat is encouraging for cryptocurrency investors because the sunnier the economic future seems to be, the more adventurous the market gets. That being said, however, there wasn't any new development on the macroeconomic front. The cryptoverse continued to be buoyed by the not-so-fresh news of previous days.\n\nThe hope of spot crypto ETFs\n\nOne potentially strong market-pusher currently on hold is the future of spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Last month there were several pieces of news tilting in favor of these securities, which have been concocted by some top names in the finance industry (like BlackRock with its proposed Bitcoin ETF).\n\nAlas, still none have yet been approved by the crypto-skeptical U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; the hot gossip is that this will occur very soon. But gossip isn't occurrence, and while the prospect of spot crypto ETFs is exciting, their future remains in limbo. Investors continue to hope for a slew of approvals, however, and that's helping to sustain the rally."

        "title": "Bitcoin price continues to drop, but how are pro BTC traders positioned? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a remarkable 15.7% price surge in the first six days of December. This surge has been heavily influenced by the anticipation of an imminent approval of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Senior Bloomberg ETF analysts have expressed a 90% probability for approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which is expected before Jan. 10.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s recent price surge may not be as straightforward as it seems. Analysts have failed to consider the multiple rejections at $37,500 and $38,500 during the second half of November. These rejections have left professional traders, including market makers, questioning the market\u2019s strength, particularly from the perspective of derivatives metrics.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s inherent volatility explains pro traders\u2019 reduced appetite\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 7.6% rally to $37,965 on Nov. 15 resulted in disappointment as the movement fully retracted the following day. Similarly, between Nov. 20 and Nov. 21, Bitcoin's price declined by 5.3% after the $37,500 resistance proved more formidable than anticipated.\n\nWhile corrections are natural even during bullish markets, they explain why whales and market makers are avoiding leveraged long positions in these volatile conditions. Surprisingly, despite positive daily candles throughout this period, buyers using long leverage were forcefully liquidated, with losses totaling a staggering $390 million in the past five days.\n\nAlthough the Bitcoin futures premium on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) reached its highest level in two years, indicating excessive demand for long positions, this trend doesn't necessarily apply to all exchanges and client profiles. In some cases, top traders have reduced their long-to-short leverage ratio to the lowest levels seen in 30 days. This indicates a profit-taking movement and reduced demand for bullish bets above $40,000.\n\nBy consolidating positions across perpetual and quarterly futures contracts, a clearer insight can be gained into whether professional traders are leaning toward a bullish or bearish stance.\n\nExchanges\u2019 top traders BTC long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nStarting on Dec. 1, OKX's top traders favored long positions with a strong 3.8 ratio. However, as the price surged above $40,000, those long positions were closed. Currently, the ratio heavily favors shorts by 38%, marking the lowest level in over 30 days. This shift suggests that some significant players have stepped back from the current rally.\n\nHowever, the entire market doesn't share this sentiment. Binance's top traders have shown an opposing movement. On Dec. 1, their ratio favored longs by 16%, which has since increased to a 29% position skewed towards the bullish side. Nevertheless, the absence of leveraged longs among top traders is a positive sign, confirming that the rally has primarily been driven by spot market accumulation.\n\nRelated: Canadian crypto exchanges reach $1B in assets under management\n\nOptions data confirms that some whales are not buying into the rally\n\nTo determine whether traders were caught off-guard and currently hold short positions underwater, analysts should examine the balance between call (buy) and put (sell) options. A growing demand for put options typically indicates traders focusing on neutral-to-bearish price strategies.\n\nBTC options put-to-call volumes at OKX. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nData from Bitcoin options at OKX reveals an increasing demand for puts relative to calls. This suggests that these whales and market makers might not have anticipated the price rally. Still, traders were not betting on a price decline as the indicator favored the call options in terms of volume. An excess demand for put (sell) options would have moved the metric above 1.0.\n\nBitcoin's rally toward $44,000 appears healthy, as no excessive leverage has been deployed. However, some significant players were taken by surprise, reducing their leverage longs and showing increased demand for put options simultaneously.\n\nAs Bitcoin's price remains above $42,000 in anticipation of a potential spot ETF approval in early January, the incentives for bulls to pressure those whales who chose not to participate in the recent rally grow stronger.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to hedge funds. If you want to skip our overview of the explosive cryptocurrency sector that continues to surprise, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\n\n2023 has been the year of artificial intelligence. It started with doom and gloom all around as investors were reeling from high interest rates and predictions of a recession. This environment does not bode well for high growth areas such as cryptocurrency, and naturally, these stocks were poor performers. In fact, 2022 was a bloodbath for the cryptocurrency industry and stocks, as high interest rates incentivized capital to flow into stable savings accounts and the money market, which left cryptocurrency in the dust.\n\nFor instance, the price of Bitcoin which is the world's premier cryptocurrency and a widely known benchmark for the sector, tanked to below $16,500 in November 2022. This time period was one of the worst for growth assets, as back then the Federal Reserve was pumping up interest rates by massive 75 point hikes a piece. At the same time, just as crypto was struggling to find its footing, calamity hit the cryptocurrency sector as cryptocurrency exchange FTX declared bankruptcy. While declaring bankruptcy itself is not particularly controversial as several firms go through the process, FTX's liquidation was far from ordinary.\n\nThis is because at the heart of the FTX saga was the question of legitimacy that cryptocurrency critics have continued to worry about. Since Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are not backed by any assets, their value is thought to be purely speculative and determined by market sentiment alone. In the case of FTX, it was revealed that the firm funneled customer deposits into speculative investments - including its own token - and when these investments crashed, it lost customer money. A fraud of epic proportions, it saw FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried face trial for exactly a year before being convicted on all seven counts that prosecutors had brought against him.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, while FTX is a thing of the past, Bitcoin surely isn't. After dropping to multi-year lows in 2022, the world's favorite cryptocurrency is basking in the evolving financial markets environment of 2023. Year to date, Bitcoin has gained a respectable 151% on the market, and its current price of ~$42,000 is the highest level at which it has been in 2023. There are several reasons behind this surge. One of these is the expected easing in financial conditions that has also fueled the flagship S&P 500 stock index and the NASDAQ indexes in November. Lower interest rates naturally fuel riskier assets as investors want alternative avenues for a return, and Bitcoin is perhaps the riskiest of all assets.\n\nApart from the financial conditions, the nature of Bitcoin's price is also at play these days, Since, unlike say for shares of the Cupertino, California technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reflect Apple's financial heft and future market potential, Bitcoin's price is a reflection of market sentiment, it appreciates when investors are optimistic. These indicators of optimism primarily revolve around the growing adoption and removal of regulatory constraints surrounding Bitcoin. Now, one of the biggest tailwinds for Bitcoin's price is a potential approval of an exchange traded fund (ETF) that would improve investor access to the cryptocurrency by allowing stock market participants to also trade in Bitcoin. The potential for this fund is no laughing matter since estimates show that should such a fund be approved by the S.E.C., then a whopping $3 billion could flow into it on the first day and up to $55 billion over the next five years. If you're interested in taking a look at Bitcoin specific stocks, then you should check out our coverage of the 10 Best Bitcoin and Blockchain Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nSo, as crypto appears to be taking off once again, we decided to take a look at the best cryptocurrency stocks to buy.

Bitcoin's \u201cGreed\u201d shows that the market may be stepping into the correction phase soon. When it shows \u201cFear,\u201d this indicates that market participants are being hit with FOMO (fear of missing out) and are rushing to buy crypto.\n\nOn-chain data vendor Santiment has recently spread the word about a significant increase in the number of Bitcoin addresses holding 100+ BTC. By the time Bitcoin surged to reach $44,000 earlier this week, \u201cthe amount of existing 100+ $BTC wallets have correlated tightly with this price climb.\u201d Since the big decline on Nov. 9, 48 of these addresses that belong to whales have returned over the last four weeks, Santiment tweet says.\n\nBullish Bitcoin price expectations continue to dominate the market with a powerful reason behind them \u2013 around a dozen Bitcoin spot ETF submissions are currently being reviewed by the SEC regulatory team."

        "content": "ORDI's price is up big time.\n\nORDI trading has also made the Bitcoin network more congested.\n\nORDI, a buzzy token on the Bitcoin blockchain, has registered a 204% gain since the start of December, placing it among the top performing crypto assets so far this month.\n\nThe reason? Growing enthusiasm for the Ordinals protocol \u2014 a way to give normally interchangeable micro units of Bitcoin unique identifiers \u2014 allowing them to be tracked, transferred, and imbued with individual meanings.\n\nThe growing interest in ORDI is mirrored in Bitcoin network\u2019s transaction fees. They\u2019re at their highest point in over two years as traders speculate on assets within the network\u2019s Ordinals ecosystem.\n\nAnd ORDI is at the centre of such speculation.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nORDI's price\n\nORDI is a BRC-20 token, a token standard made possible by the Ordinals protocol.\n\nBRC-20 tokens are similar to the ERC-20 standard which lets users create fungible tokens on Ethereum. Uniswap\u2019s governance token, UNI, is an example of an ERC-20 token.\n\nORDI was the first BRC-20 token created, and just like Bitcoin, it has a total supply of 21 million coins.\n\nOther major BRC-20 tokens include SATS, named after the smallest possible denomination of Bitcoin \u2014 a Satoshi \u2014 and DOMO, named after the pseudonymous developer who created the BRC-20 token standard.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nAlthough ORDI doesn\u2019t do anything at the moment, other BRC-20 tokens are starting to incorporate utility, such as token voting.\n\nBut ORDI has become the main proxy for the success of other assets built on the Ordinals protocol, and the potential the new technology brings to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nTop crypto exchange Binance\u2019s decision to list ORDI for trading in early November has also contributed to its rise in popularity.\n\nORDI currently sits at a $1.4 billion market capitalisation, making it the 52nd-biggest crypto asset.\n\nWhat are Ordinals?\n\nThe Ordinals protocol was created by software engineer Casey Rodarmor in January. The protocol helps generate eponymous Ordinals, or also called Inscriptions. They represent the closest counterpart to Ethereum\u2019s non-fungible tokens within the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nUnlike many NFTs on Ethereum, Ordinals inscribe their data directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, making them immutable.\n\nBut the protocol has split opinions within the Bitcoin community.\n\nSupporters say it heralds new use cases for the Bitcoin blockchain, which has received criticism in recent years due to its limited functionality compared to other blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana.\n\nBut detractors argue that Ordinals clog Bitcoin with excess data, and detract from Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original vision of the blockchain as a payments network.\n\nBitcoin Frogs is currently the top-traded Ordinals collection, with an all time trading volume of over 935 BTC \u2014 or about $41 million.\n\nSo far, Bitcoin users have created over 46 million unique inscriptions through the Ordinals protocol, according to data from Ordinals blockchain explorer Ordiscan.\n\nAnd they\u2019re starting to receive mainstream attention.\n\nThis month, Sotheby\u2019s is auctioning artwork from BitcoinShrooms, a project on the Bitcoin Ordinals created by the artist known as Shroomtoshi.\n\nORDI drives Bitcoin fees \u2014 and congestion \u2014 higher\n\nSince ORDI lives on the Bitcoin blockchain, traders must pay fees in Bitcoin to buy and sell it.\n\nThe increased ORDI trading has made Bitcoin more congested, causing transaction fees to rise substantially. The cost to use Bitcoin now consistently sits at its highest level since 2021, according to data from BitInfoCharts.\n\nOver the past week, Bitcoin has generated $26.4 million from transaction fees according to DefiLlama data. That puts it ahead of popular DeFi protocols like Uniswap and Lido.\n\nData from mempool.space shows that there are currently over 245,000 unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions waiting to be processed.\n\nBut every day users of Bitcoin \u2014 like those in El Salvador where it\u2019s legal tender \u2014 typically rely on a scaling solution called the Lightning network. That makes Bitcoin transactions much faster and cheaper."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 crept up only 0.8%.\n\nThe monthly U.S. jobs report will give further signals on whether current monetary policy is tackling inflation. It could also provide some interest rate expectations before the Federal Reserve's last meeting of the year on Dec. 13.\n\nBitcoin BTC -5.46% , which tends to correlate with major equity indices, was down 1.2% at 1:22 p.m. ET, changing hands for $43,383.\n\nOpen interest still indicates bullish expectations\n\nDespite two days of modest declines, open interest in bitcoin options on the Deribit derivatives exchange shows a large number of calls outstanding for the $75,000 strike price for the end of January expiry date. Traders purchasing the right to buy bitcoin at that level suggest they could be expecting the market price to keep rising.\n\nDeribit Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers said the open contracts could have been sold as part of a $50,000 to $75,000 January call spread. \"This means that the traders may be expecting the market to expire anywhere between those strikes,\" Strijers told The Block.\n\nAccording to Deribit data, the derivatives exchange now has 3,684 bitcoin option calls outstanding for the $75,000 strike price, which have a notional value of around $162 million. This group of calls still outstanding is second only to those for the $50,000 strike price.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nThe aggregated open interest of bitcoin options across all major centralized crypto derivatives exchanges has reached an all-time high of $17.3 billion, according to The Block's Data Dashboard.\n\nAn increase in open interest suggests that new money is entering the market, indicating growing participation and potential liquidity.\n\nIn reference to the recent rally in the bitcoin market, Strijers said he attributes the surge to a confluence of factors including widespread optimism in anticipation of a possible decision from Securities and Exchange Commission about a spot bitcoin ETF, easing concerns following the settlement of Binance's legal matters, escalating geopolitical tensions, easing of inflation and the steady increase in institutional engagement."

However, it also had a gloomy prediction for the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cThe US recession will finally arrive, but so will the first spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d it stated before predicting that \u201cmore than $2.4 billion may flow into these ETFs in Q1 2024 to support Bitcoin\u2019s price.\u201d\n\nThe firm also stated that the BTC halving, due in April or May, \u201cwill see minimal market disruption,\u201d but there will be a post-halving price rise.\n\nVanEck predicts that Bitcoin will make an all-time high in Q4 2024, \u201cpotentially spurred by political events and regulatory shifts following a U.S. presidential election.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. presidential elections are scheduled to be held on Nov. 5, 2024.\n\nEther won\u2019t flip Bitcoin\n\nThe firm also said it believes Ether (ETH) won\u2019t likely flip Bitcoin in 2024 but will still outperform major tech stocks.\n\n\u201cLike past cycles, Bitcoin will lead the market to rally, and the value will flow into smaller tokens just after the halving.

        "content": "DISTRIBUTED-WORK-MODEL/OAKLAND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bitkey, the self-custody bitcoin wallet built by Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ), launched today in more than 95 countries across six continents, widening access to self-custody and empowering people around the world to truly own and manage their bitcoin easily and safely. Today, the vast majority of the millions of bitcoin owners1 keep their bitcoin in the custodial platforms or exchanges where they bought it, leaving them under the control of the custodian. Accessing self-custody solutions where people can truly own the keys to their bitcoin still often relies on a complex set of devices or long passwords that people need to remember to be able to recover their money in case of loss.\n\nBitkey includes a mobile app, hardware device, and a set of recovery tools in case the customer loses the phone, their hardware, or both. Built by the Proto team at Block, Bitkey is now available for pre-orders2 at bitkey.world, with shipping starting in early 2024. Thomas Templeton, who leads the Proto team, said:\n\n\u201cThe bitcoin decentralized payments network has the potential to create a more inclusive financial system for all, especially those who have traditionally been underserved. In the future, we believe customers will demand ownership and self-custody because it brings peace of mind, reduces dependence on any one entity, and puts individuals in control of their own bitcoin. With Bitkey, we are building a safe and easy way for people all around the world with different levels of experiences with bitcoin to take control of their finances on their terms.\u201d\n\nEase of use and peace of mind\n\nGareth is one of the customers part of Bitkey\u2019s external beta program, based in South Africa. He works in the banking sector and has some previous experience with other self-custody wallets as well as exchange-hosted wallets.\n\nAccording to Gareth, \u201cThe major benefit is that this is the first time my family would be comfortable engaging in self-custody. It is an experience that makes a healthy set of trade-offs to make bitcoin self custody accessible to all for the first time. There is still a huge amount of work to be done in terms of convincing and educating people that they should be self custodying their bitcoin, but this product certainly removes the most significant barrier to entry - complexity.\u201d\n\nA critical part of making self-custody more accessible is providing forgiving recovery experiences that prioritize both simple and secure paths to help customers recover their money when something goes wrong, without the burden of having to remember long passwords. According to Lindsey Grossman, Business Lead for Bitkey:\n\n\u201cPeople holding bitcoin on exchanges and custodial platforms today are often hesitant to move to self-custody wallets because they are nervous about making mistakes, especially with the historical requirement that you must safely guard 12 or 24-word long passwords called \u2018seed phrases\u2019. People have often felt stuck: worried about the lack of control they might experience on a custodial platform or exchange, yet also anxious about the unforgiving product experiences that exist in other self-custody wallets historically available. With Bitkey, we wanted to build a product that helps bring everyone to self-custody, combining robust security and recovery options, with a simple customer experience that puts them in control of their money.\u201d\n\nBitkey addresses this with a unique 2-of-3 multi-signature design that doesn\u2019t require customers to remember long passwords or seed phrases: it uses three keys to secure bitcoin, and any two keys working together are needed to move bitcoin or approve other security-related actions like initiating recovery or modifying security settings.\n\nBitkey puts two keys in customers\u2019 hands: one is in the mobile app, which enables customers to make bitcoin transactions easily on their mobile phone, track their balance, and manage security preferences; and the second customer-held key is in the hardware device, securely stored offline. The hardware key serves two main purposes: an extra layer of security to co-sign money movements (based on a customer-set limit); and enables recovery when customers lose their phone.\n\nA third key is on Bitkey\u2019s server and is used for only two things: to help customers move bitcoin with just their phone for the transactions they choose to make on the go without their hardware device, and to help customers recover their wallet if they lose their phone or hardware - or even both. Importantly, because Bitkey only has access to one, not two or three keys in this 2-of-3 multi-signature wallet, Bitkey cannot access or move a customer\u2019s bitcoin without them. This puts customers in true control of their money, while giving them peace of mind that they can recover their money if they lose something (for more information on how Bitkey\u2019s 2-of-3 multi-signature design and recovery tools works, read \u2018How it works page\u2019).\n\nHelping bring more bitcoin to self-custody\n\nPart of Bitkey\u2019s mission relies on connecting people across two worlds: the world of today\u2019s domestic or regional centralized fiat monetary systems, and bitcoin\u2019s distributed, borderless financial system. In June 2023, coinciding with the kick-off of the external beta program that launched that month, Bitkey announced its first two partnerships with Coinbase, a leading global exchange, and Cash App, a leading financial services app and part of the Block ecosystem, to help people easily and transfer their bitcoin off exchanges and custodial platforms, making the journey to self-custody easier.\n\nThanks to these partnerships, Bitkey customers are able to choose a partner they would like to transfer or buy bitcoin with and then initiate a transfer from that partner to self-custody in their Bitkey wallet - all through a seamless integration. The transfer and buy+transfer features will roll out in a staggered approach, starting with the ability to transfer existing bitcoin from Coinbase and Cash App available immediately upon the product\u2019s launch. These two partnerships are the first of more to come globally. More information on our partner integrations can be found in our blogpost \u2018Welcoming our first global partners: Coinbase and Cash App\u2019.\n\nAbout Bitkey\n\nBitkey is a self-custody bitcoin wallet with three parts \u2014 a mobile app to make transactions easily on the phone, a hardware device to protect savings securely offline, and a set of recovery tools in case customers lose their phone, hardware, or both. As an innovative multi-signature self-custody wallet, Bitkey provides innovative recovery tools that give customers multiple ways to recover their money, so they can take their bitcoin off exchanges and truly own and control it themselves, without the anxiety of guarding a long complex seed phrase. Bitkey provides the convenience of a mobile app, the security of hardware, and peace of mind that in case they lose something, customers can still recover their money. Bitkey is built by the Proto Team at Block, Inc. Proto\u2019s mission is to help accelerate the world\u2019s transition to a more open economy by making products that increase access and independence for everyone. Bitkey is the first of these.

As the world's first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin set the pace for our current blockchain revolution, However, Litecoin showed the market that you can build on the strengths of Bitcoin and add a little more technical capabilities without reducing the coin's effectiveness or overall purpose.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin was designed and built in 2008 and entered the market in 2009. Bitcoin's anonymous creator, who goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, describes in forum posts how he was able to solve the notorious double-spend issue that plagued all previous digital currencies. The double-spend issue was a technical limitation. It described the scenario that occurred when you sent a digital currency to someone and at nearly the exact time, you sent the same currency to another party. The resulting delay would make it impossible to stop. Satoshi figured out that he could add a timestamp to the Proof-of-Work algorithm. Embedding this timestamp in each block makes it impossible to send two transactions at the same time without discrepancies arising.\n\nWhat is Litecoin?\n\nIt wasn't long before other developers took notice of Satoshi's unique approach. One such developer and Google employee, Charlie Lee. He was so inspired by the concept that he decided to join in on the revolution. Rather than compete with Bitcoin directly, Lee sought to become the Robin to Bitcoin's Batman. In his own words, he explains that Litecoin is the silver to Bitcoin's gold.\n\nLitecoin entered the market as an open-source client on GitHub on October 7, 2011. Litecoin was one of the earliest hard forks of the Bitcoin Core client. In Lee\u2019s version of cryptocurrency, technical aspects were beefed up. For example, Bitcoin confirms blocks of transactions every 10 minutes. These blocks are limited to 1MB in data.\n\nLitecoin confirms a block every 2.5 minutes. The network is much faster than Bitcoin with developers listing it at 28 transactions per second. Interestingly, this faster generation rate matches the increase in total supply versus Bitcoin. There are only 21,000,000 BTC to ever be available. There are 84,000,000 LTC slated for issuance in total.\n\nConsensus Mechanisms\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Litecoin rely on a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. Bitcoin utilizes the SHA-256 mechanism. SHA stands for Secure Hashing Algorithm. This is a mathematical equation that miners solve. The miner that successfully answers the equation is rewarded with the mining reward and gets to officially add the next block of transactions to the blockchain.\n\nThe current reward for miners on Bitcoin's blockchain is 6.25 BTC. Notably, these mining rewards are the only time that new BTC enters the market. They are designed to occur every ten minutes. To ensure the predictive nature of Bitcoin's monetary supply, the SHA-256 equation automatically adjusts difficulty. The more hashing power of the network, the more difficult the answer. To increase the difficulty, the equation simply requires more zeros in the answer.\n\nThe original Bitcoin mining reward was 50 BTC. These rewards decrease in half roughly every four years. The current Litecoin mining reward is 12.5 LTC, at the time of writing. It\u2019s scheduled to remain there until sometime around August 2023. Like Bitcoin, Litecoin is designed to halve mining rewards approximately every four years\n\nLitecoin Scrypt PoW\n\nLitecoin uses a PoW algorithm as well. Unlike Bitcoin, Litecoin's consensus mechanism is a memory-hard, scrypt-based mining PoW protocol. Scrypt was built specifically to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks. In addition, Litecoin incorporates a slightly modified GUI. These changes made it a bit more complicated to create and more expensive to produce Litecoin mining rigs in the early days of cryptocurrencies.\n\nShared Updates\n\nBitcoin and Litecoin share many technical aspects. For this reason, it shouldn't be a huge surprise to learn that they also share many of their core updates. For example, both coins utilize Segregated Witness (SegWit). SegWit allows the network to split transactions into two segments. The goal is to remove the unlocking signature, also known as \u201cwitness\u201d data from the original portion. This information is then re-added as a separate structure at the end of the transaction.\n\nSegregated Witness first became a discussion after the introduction of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal number BIP141. Shortly after, on 21 July 2017, Bitcoin miners upgraded to Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91. Specifically, SegWit went active on BTC at block 477,120.\n\nLitecoin Adds the Lightning Network\n\nLitecoin beat BTC to the punch on this upgrade. Litecoin miners updated to SegWit capabilities in May 2017. This would not be the last time that Litecoin beat Bitcoin to the technical punch. Litecoin was also the first network to successfully integrate the Lightning Network. This second-layer protocol introduced the use of private payment channels to reduce blockchain congestion. Notably, the first Lightning Network transaction transferred 0.00000001 LTC from Z\u00fcrich to San Francisco. The transfer took less than one second to complete.\n\nValue Connection\n\nOver the last decade, Litecoin and Bitcoin have seen a continued decoupling of value. Litecoin users have shown completely different trading and spending habits compared to Bitcoiners. Interestingly, Litecoin will often precede Bitcoin's market movements. However, it must be noted that Bitcoin has proven to be a better, or at least more popular, store of value versus Litecoin.\n\nNetwork Growth\n\nBitcoin and Litecoin have seen their markets expand considerably. Litecoin's goal to be the BTC's sidekick has paid off greatly. It\u2019s common for platforms that offer Bitcoin support to also offer Litecoin support. This compatibility has helped Litecoin remain a popular coin in the market, despite the emergence of tons of competition.\n\nWhere to Buy Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC)?\n\nThese are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. The exchanges below enable the purchase of both of these digital assets.\n\nUphold \u2013 This is one of the top exchanges for United States & UK residents that offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Germany & Netherlands are prohibited.\n\nUphold Disclaimer: Terms Apply. Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Your capital is at risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong..\n\nKraken \u2013 Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the most trusted names in the industry with over 9,000,000 users, and over $207 billion in quarterly trading volume.\n\nThe Kraken exchange offers trading access to over 190 countries including Australia, Canada, Europe, and is a top exchange for USA residents. (Excluding New York & Washington state).\n\nBitcoin vs Litecoin \u2013 What's Better?\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer to this question. Bitcoin serves a valuable role as the first cryptocurrency in the world. For that reason alone, it will always hold value in the community. Litecoin provides all the technical aspects of Bitcoin and the longevity of being one of the oldest cryptocurrencies in the world. Much like silver, it\u2019s more affordable than the premier option but still is a wise investment. For these reasons, savvy investors hold both of these coins.\n\nTo learn more, make sure to visit our Investing in Bitcoin and Investing in Litecoin guides."

        "content": "Developers of Bitcoin side-chain MicroVisionChain (MVC) have unveiled a BRC-20 decentralized exchange (DEX) as part of its roadmap for Q1 2024.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, MVC chief operating officer Jason Kwok claims to have developed a \u201c1:1 mapping relationship\u201d with Bitcoin on its sidechain. \u201cThis essentially creates a parallel version of your Bitcoin assets, such as BRC-20, on MVC,\u201d said Kwok, explaining that the bridge allows users to swap BRC-20 token assets on the MVC sidechain, thus bypassing the high transaction and gas fees required to deploy decentralized applications (DApps) on the Bitcoin mainnet.\n\n\u201cMVC shares the same underlying architecture as Bitcoin, which means the same mnemonic phrases and receiving addresses can be used across both. This significantly reduces the learning curve and enhances user-friendliness.\u201d\n\nIn keeping with the spirit of Bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, Kwok explains that MVC has no particular founders or corporate headquarters. Instead, the sidechain is a \u201ccollaborative endeavor\u201d involving many development teams that form the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nInvented by Web3 developer Rodarmor in January, BRC-20 tokens have surged in popularity as one of the largest technological advancements in a 15-year-old blockchain. Bitcoin Ordinals is a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each satoshi, or 1/100 millionth of a Bitcoin (BTC), enabling tracking and transfer. Combined with the inscription process, which adds a layer of data to each satoshi, users can mint unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe market cap of BRC-20 tokens has since exceeded $1.5 billion, led by memecoin Ordinals (ORDI), which is not associated with the Ordinals protocol.\n\nAs part of MVC\u2019s 2024 roadmap, Kwok says that the project is also developing a meta-contract integrated development environment (IDE) that would enable the migration of DApps from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to MVC\u2019s Bitcoin sidechain. \u201cThe meta-contract IDE is capable of compiling TypeScript, a high-level language, into the low-level op_code language on MVC. This process is a critical component in the development of MVC smart contracts and the expansion of BVM [Bitcoin Virtual Machine] DApps,\u201d he said.\n\nBVM aims to integrate the functionality of Turing-complete smart contracts into the Bitcoin architecture. Kwok said this is accomplishable by \u201cincorporating additional OP_CODES into Bitcoin\u2019s original structure and redefining the method of generating underlying transaction IDs.\u201d The process is also being adopted by developers Trustless Market, a Uniswap v2 fork that enabled $500,000 worth of swaps in its first three days.\n\nKwok stated that while current layer-2 solutions like the Bitcoin Lightning Network address issues related to scalability and low fees, they cannot onboard Bitcoin into the greater decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. \u201cBitcoin ecosystem applications, like wallets and NFT [nonfungible token] markets, can easily add support for MVC without requiring extensive additional development,\u201d said Kwok.\n\nMVC's roadmap for Q1 2024.

        "content": "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is being hauled over the hot coals by the crypto community on X (formerly Twitter) after claiming Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency\u2019s \u201conly true use case\u201d is to facilitate crime.\n\n\u201cThe only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance,\u201d Dimon said in a hearing before the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on Dec. 5. \u201cIf I were the government, I\u2019d close it down.\u201d\n\nBut crypto pundits quickly pointed out the hypocrisy in Dimon\u2019s statements, highlighting that JPMorgan is the second-largest penalized bank, having paid $39.3 billion in fines across 272 violations since 2000, according to Good Jobs First\u2019s violation tracker.\n\nAbout $38 billion of these fines came under Dimon\u2019s watch, who has been CEO since 2005.\n\n\u201cTalk about being a fucking hypocrite!\u201d said crypto lawyer John Deaton in a Dec. 6 post on X.\n\n\u201cJamie Dimon is in no position to criticize Bitcoin with this sort of track record,\u201d said VanEck strategy adviser Gabor Gurbacs, who noted that banks worldwide have paid $380 billion in fines this century.\n\nTalk about being a fucking hypocrite! Who\u2019s the criminal Jamie Dimon? Let me ask you a question: In the last 5 years when @jpmorgan has been FINED over THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ($35,000,000,000) for illicit and fraudulent activities, did any of your staff use #Bitcoin or\u2026 https://t.co/DF2B4SkbwD \u2014 John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) December 6, 2023\n\nJPMorgan agreed to a $75 million settlement with the U.S. Virgin Islands in September over allegations that it enabled and financially benefitted from Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking operation between 2002 and 2005. However, it should be noted that settlements aren\u2019t admissions of guilt.\n\nIn October 2013, the bank paid $13 billion \u2014 the largest fine in its corporate history \u2014 for fraudulently misleading investors over \u201ctoxic\u201d mortgage deals. Toxic Investments fall in value significantly, causing the market to collapse.\n\nSeveral JPMorgan traders were also investigated for manipulating various metals futures markets between 2008 and 2016 and agreed to pay nearly $1 billion to settle the investigation in September 2020.\n\nPenalties paid by JPMorgan over various violations.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT\u2019s Cryptofinance newsletter.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t noticed, bitcoin is on a bit of a tear this month.\n\nIts 16 per cent gain in December alone takes the gains for the year to more than 160 per cent and the $44,000 price was last seen 20 months ago.\n\nLike Dorothy discovered in The Wizard of Oz, it was all a dream. The crashes, corporate failures, criminal charges and lawsuits that piled up on crypto in that period suddenly seem a distant memory.\n\nPeople such as Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao are no longer the top bosses but seen as the old guard on the way out and associated with past crimes and misdemeanours.\n\nAround the industry the confidence is tangible. Want to invest in a bitcoin private credit fund run by a start-up backed by Sam Altman? How about buying a crypto fund that is trading at as much as eight times its underlying value?\n\nThe tide is carrying in the future, in the form of a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund in the US. Mistakenly or not, the expectation is that it could come as soon as next month.\n\nThere is one unheralded aspect to this latest rally: the influence of Asia. The region has not been as forceful in clamping down on bad behaviour as the US.\n\nFor example, both South Korea and the US want to extradite Do Kwon, the entrepreneur behind the $40bn collapse of crypto token TerraUSD, to answer charges. But where South Korea wants to speak to him for allegedly violating capital market rules, the US has charged him with eight criminal counts, including securities, commodities and wire fraud.\n\n\u201cMuch of the regulatory crackdown we\u2019ve seen this year has happened firmly in the US. Singapore, Japan, South Korea, they\u2019re more hospitable to crypto,\u201d said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of investment adviser Lumida Wealth Management.\n\n\u201cThese markets are more speculative, and crypto subsectors like gaming are so much more popular out there,\u201d he added.\n\nSo much so that the main sovereign currency that people use to trade against crypto tokens is now the Korean won, not the US dollar.\n\nThe won accounts for 41 per cent of the market, according to CCData, up from 24 per cent in September. In the same period the US dollar\u2019s share of the market has fallen from 51 per cent to a tick under 40 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe fact that bitcoin broke through resistance in the Asian hours is a testament to how important retail volumes in that region, namely South Korea, are becoming,\u201d said Michael Safai, chief executive at trading firm Dexterity Capital.\n\n\u201cInstitutional grabs headlines, but retail flow is the lifeblood of the crypto markets,\u201d he added.\n\nThat resurgence is also shown in the market shares of OKX and Bybit, two of Asia\u2019s most popular exchanges.\n\nVolume in spot markets on OKX jumped to more than $71bn last month, more than double October\u2019s $33bn, and a height not seen since May 2022, CCData said. OKX\u2019s monthly derivatives volume also leapt to $659bn in November, up from $429bn in October.\n\nBybit\u2019s volumes are at a level last seen in February 2022. Last month it registered $56bn in spot volumes while derivatives volumes shot up to $375bn, up from the previous month\u2019s $262bn.\n\n\u201cA lot of crypto\u2019s speculative and retail firepower remains intact in Asia,\u201d Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex, told me.\n\nAnd notably, their gains have come at Binance\u2019s expense. OKX and Bybit started the year with a 4 and 1 per cent and Binance on 55. Now OKX has 8, Bybit 6 and Binance just 31 per cent.\n\n\u201cWall Street\u2019s crypto embrace doesn\u2019t just buoy institutions, it can reignite retail, including in other parts of the world, it\u2019s like a positive feedback loop,\u201d Solot added.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on bitcoin\u2019s recent rally and Asia\u2019s role in crypto markets? As always, email me your thoughts at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nLate on Thursday a US judge ruled that former Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao will remain in the US until his sentencing, which is due to take place in February. The judge said that, while Zhao offered a significant bail package, it was \u201cinadequate to ensure [Zhao\u2019s] return when considering the vast resources and assets at his disposal\u201d.\n\nKristin Johnson, commissioner at the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said the hefty $4.3bn penalty levied against Binance should serve as a warning to others. Speaking at the FT\u2019s Crypto and Digital Assets Summit, Johnson said: \u201cTake the hint, you could save yourself a lot in any number of different ways.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s third-largest bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale this week launched trading of its EUR CoinVertible stablecoin on crypto exchange Bitstamp, becoming the first major bank to launch its own dollar-pegged token on a crypto exchange.\n\nSoundbite of the week: You want answers?\n\nAt the FT\u2019s crypto summit on Tuesday I spoke to Richard Teng, Binance\u2019s new chief executive.\n\nHe\u2019s been in the role for just over two weeks since CZ stepped down as part of the DoJ settlement and has promised that Binance will learn from past mistakes. He\u2019d also stressed that users should feel confident in the strength, safety and stability of the exchange.\n\nWith this pledge in mind I asked the Binance chief some of the questions that have dogged the company in recent years, like where its company headquarters is or the status of an audit. Sadly, those questions still remain unanswered. At one point he said:\n\n\u201cWhy do you feel so entitled to these answers?\u201d And: \u201cIs there a need for us to share all of this information publicly? No.\u201d\n\nData mining: Hungry for more\n\nA decent indicator as to the durability of a rally is whether investors are buying a lot of something.\n\nNumbers shared by CCData suggest that may indeed be the case. Average weekly trading volumes across 25 of the top digital assets investment products, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust or ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, have hit the $3bn mark twice this quarter.\n\nVolumes are also showing some consistency and have sat comfortably over $2bn for four consecutive weeks, which suggests some real appetite out there.\n\nFT Cryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford.

        "title": "Polychain Capital and Hack VC Lead $18 Million Funding Round for Bitcoin Staking Protocol Babylon - Business Wire",
        "content": "PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Babylon, the project that aims to build a Bitcoin-secured decentralized world, today announced the close of its $18 million funding round. The round was co-led by Polychain Capital and Hack VC, with participation from Framework Ventures, Polygon Ventures, Castle Island Ventures, OKX Ventures, Finality Capital, Breyer Capital, Symbolic Capital, IOSG Ventures and many other investors. The funds will be used to bolster the advancement of Babylon's Bitcoin Staking protocol, which converts the 21 million bitcoins into a decentralized staking asset for the Proof-of-Stake economy in a trustless way.\n\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) chains have historically been tethered to their native assets for security. However, as the majority of capital gravitates to established protocols, emerging chains often grapple with limited staked resources, undermining their security. In addition, to attract staking, chains typically have to implement very high inflation to pay for high staking rewards, which affects its token utility and economic health. This has resulted in a fragmented ecosystem where networks are forced to compete for a limited pool of staked capital.\n\nBabylon is the first marketplace to offer Bitcoin, the world\u2019s most decentralized asset, to the PoS world. Babylon\u2019s Bitcoin Staking Protocol provides a way for PoS chains to introduce Bitcoin as a staking asset. This allows PoS chains to acquire staking capital from the largest crypto asset in the world and enjoy high crypto-economic security that could be much higher than what the native token alone can achieve. In addition, since Bitcoin has been serving as a store of value without much yield, using Bitcoin as a staking asset can greatly reduce PoS chains\u2019 inflation pressure.\n\nIn July this year, Babylon published a litepaper outlining its pioneering concept of native trustless Bitcoin Staking. This concept allows Bitcoin holders to provide crypto-economic security to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems and earn PoS yields by staking their bitcoins. This innovation follows Nakamoto's spirit and does not require any soft/hard fork of the Bitcoin chain, nor any bridging, wrapping, and third party custody of the bitcoins. Recent data reinforces the pressing need for such an innovation and is highlighted in a recent Glassnode report, which found that a staggering 66% of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply, equivalent to 12.26 million BTC, remained dormant for a year. This indicates vast untapped potential, and the opportunity for positioning idle bitcoins to boost the economic security of PoS chains and decentralized applications (dApps) that rely on staking.\n\nWhat investors are saying\n\nLuke Pearson, General Partner at Polychain:\n\n\u201cPolychain is pleased to announce our participation in Babylon\u2019s recent funding round. Babylon boasts a world-class team with strong technical and academic expertise. We are thrilled to support them in creating Bitcoin staking, unlocking the largest digital asset to further blockchain security as a whole. Babylon's introduction of a Bitcoin staking protocol not only unlocks Bitcoin's potential but also paves the way for innovative Bitcoin-backed services and native blockchain advancements. We eagerly anticipate the ripple effects Babylon will create, positively influencing new chains and enhancing security across the entire blockchain landscape.\u201d\n\nAlex Pack, Managing Partner at HackVC:\n\n\u201c We are thrilled to have co-led Babylon\u2019s current round. Babylon is a significant development in the Bitcoin ecosystem. By creating the first protocol for Bitcoin staking and restaking, Babylon not only unlocks the largest blockchain asset, but can also make Bitcoin-backed security services (such as data availability service) possible for the broader blockchain ecosystem\"\n\nVance Spencer, co-founder Framework Ventures:\n\n\" We are incredibly excited to back Babylon and stake our BTC through their staking and restaking protocol. Staking is the next evolution for BTC and will bring native yield, utility, and an expansive market to its doorstep. Babylon's team is boldly pushing the frontier of what is possible for BTC forward\"\n\nSandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon:\n\n\" At Polygon, we are dedicated to supporting initiatives that tackle crucial challenges within the blockchain ecosystem and allow builders to build the next billion dollar companies. Babylon plays a crucial role as a marketplace connecting decentralized trust to yield, revolutionizing the staking landscape by enabling Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chains to stake not only native tokens but also Bitcoin as well. With Polygon zk proving technology those chains can get settlement on Ethereum and interconnectivity with multiple layer2 ecosystem. Babylon is becoming a contributor to Polygon CDK and the Polygon ecosystem more broadly. Babylon integrating their solution into Polygon's staking hub not only bolsters the security of emerging chains but also addresses inflationary pressures inherent in traditional staking models. This integration allows for a more equitable and efficient token economy. Developers will be able to use Babylon's solution by launching a CDK chain using Polygon CDK.\n\nOur mission at Polygon is to facilitate the creation of decentralized ecosystems atop Ethereum for any community. Babylon's vision aligns with our commitment to fostering decentralized ecosystems by offering diverse options for communities to seamlessly choose from. We are enthusiastic about the positive impact this collaboration will bring to the wider blockchain community.\"\n\nNic Carter, Founding Partner at Castle Island Ventures:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be investing in Babylon and helping the team realize their vision. Babylon is a world class technical and academic team and we believe their innovations in Bitcoin restaking are a fundamental development in blockchain security. Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work security remains the gold standard among blockchains, and Babylon for the first time makes it available to other protocols. We\u2019ve seen the success of restaking elsewhere, and now Babylon unlocks the \u2018dry powder\u2019 of idle Bitcoin to provide trustless economic security to other blockchains. This is a significant positive development both for Bitcoin itself and other protocols aiming to inherit its security. At Castle Island we are excited to be witnessing a resurgence in Bitcoin-native innovation, and Babylon is emblematic of that vision.\u201d\n\nJeff Ren, Partner of OKX Ventures:\n\n\" OKX Ventures is excited about our investment in Babylon, a timely and pivotal innovator in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Our commitment reflects our support for groundbreaking developments and visionary founders in the industry. OKX has been a steadfast supporter and leader in the BTC and BRC20 ecosystems, and we see Babylon's approach to Bitcoin staking and restaking as a significant game-changer. We're looking forward to collaborating with them, leveraging their innovations to enhance BTC's utility and impact, particularly as the market shows renewed energy.\"\n\nIn 2022, Babylon successfully concluded its initial seed funding round, securing investments from IDG, DHVC, Breyer Capital, and other contributors.\n\nAbout Babylon\n\nBabylon is a blockchain project that designs security sharing protocols for the decentralized economy, founded in 2022 by Stanford Professor David Tse and Dr. Fisher Yu. Professor Tse is a member of the U.S. Academy of Engineering. He is renowned as the inventor of the legendary proportional-fair scheduling algorithm for wireless communications, and is the recipient of prestigious awards such as the IEEE Claude E. Shannon Award and the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal. The project is led by a team of consensus protocol researchers and experienced layer 1 engineers from around the world.\n\nBabylon's mission is to scale Bitcoin to secure the decentralized economy. To achieve this, Babylon utilizes the three primary facets of Bitcoin: its asset, its reliable timestamping service, and its most censorship-resistant blockspace in the world. To leverage these facets, Babylon is developing three innovative security-sharing protocols: Bitcoin Staking Protocol, Bitcoin Timestamping Protocol, and Bitcoin Data Availability Protocol. Through these pioneering protocols, Babylon envisions a more secure and decentralized future.\n\nFor more information about the Babylon project, please visit:\n\nWebsite: www.babylonchain.io I Twitter: https://twitter.com/babylon_chain\n\nDavid Tse, Co-founder: Acclaimed Professor of Engineering at Stanford University, whose previous work underpins the protocols of 3G/4G/5G networks.

Also, BNB , Avalanche, Tron, Chainlink, Polkadot, Siba Inu, and Litecoin surged. On the other hand, XRP Dogecoin , and Toncoin declined.BTC encountered a dip to $43,000 during the day, pulling back from its swift ascent to nearly $45,000 earlier this week. This suggests that traders opted to secure profits after the largest crypto's breakout from $38,000 a week ago, said CoinDCX Research Team.On the flip side, ETH witnessed a 5% upswing over the same period, reaching $2,372, marking its highest level since May 2022. This upward movement also positively influenced the prices of other ETH-related cryptocurrencies, positioning them as the top performers of the day. Ethereum's upsurge is credited to heightened institutional interest and the hopeful anticipation of an ETF approval by the SEC, CoinDCX added.\"From a technical standpoint, BTC is currently situated at the $44,000 resistance level. The overall momentum remains positive, with no clear signals of a reversal or bearish trend. Minor pullbacks and corrections are considered healthy for the current scenario,\" CoinDCX said.Meanwhile, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \"The current phase of sideways correction is good for building steam for the next leg-up. If this trend continues, analysts predict the next stop for BTC will be $46,000.\"The total volume in DeFi is currently $8 billion, 10.77% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $65.78 billion, which is 88.55% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency , fell to $848 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 52.65%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours rose 7.91% to $28.25 billion."

Discover SCENE\n\nTrading platform Robinhood is launching its crypto app in the EU, with a Bitcoin rewards program that will see customers earn a percentage of their trading volume back each month in BTC.\n\nAccording to a blog post announcing the news, the Robinhood Crypto will roll out to \"all eligible customers in the European Union\" alongside a rewards program based on customers' total trading volume, with Bitcoin rewards deposited in their account. A referral program also offers \"up to 1 BTC\" for signing up and referring up to 300 friends (though Robinhood is quick to note that \"98% of rewards are worth \u20ac10\u2013\u20ac20 in BTC,\" with a lucky 2% of participants receiving a full 1 BTC).\n\nBitcoin rewards on Robinhood Crypto start at 0.10% for trading volume between \u20ac0.10 and \u20ac100,000, scaling to 0.325% for volumes over \u20ac1 million, and will be locked to the user's account for 30 days after they're granted. Users will also need to trade over \u20ac100 in a month to receive the reward, otherwise they'll be rolled over until they reach the \u20ac100 threshold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRobinhood Crypto's rollout in the EU comes on the heels of Robinhood's UK launch last week. The platform launches with trading in over 25 cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum, with additional tokens, crypto transfers, crypto staking and crypto learning rewards promised in 2024. On launch, users will not be able to transfer crypto in and out of the platform, though Robinhood promises that \"crypto transfers should be available in the future.\"\n\nGM!

The legislation takes a unified approach to crypto asset regulation across all 27 EU member states, meaning that firms approved in one EU country can access other markets in the bloc with minimal paperwork. It also imposes high standards of disclosure on crypto firms and sets rules for token issuers and crypto asset service providers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Robinhood Crypto app is available for for EU citizens aged over 18 in eligible countries, and can be downloaded on Apple's iOS App Store and Google Play."

        "title": "Interview: the world's first Bitcoin life insurers - The Actuary",
        "content": "Meanwhile, based in Bermuda, is the first licensed and regulated life insurer to offer products in Bitcoin (to start with), with all premiums, claims, reserves, investments and financials denominated in Bitcoin. The company came out of \u2018stealth mode\u2019 in June, having raised $19m from prominent investors such as Sam Altman (of OpenAI fame) and Gradient Ventures (a venture capital firm specialising in artificial intelligence start-ups). It currently offers one product, a tax-compliant whole-life policy targeted at Bitcoin holders, but plans to have a more diverse product line-up in the future to cater to its target customer base.\n\n\u201cWe want to be the world\u2019s largest life insurance company, serving a billion customers,\u201d says CEO Zac Townsend. Meanwhile is his second start-up \u2013 his first was the banking-as-a-service company Standard Treasury, backed by eminent start-up accelerator Y Combinator. After selling Standard Treasury to Silicon Valley Bank, Townsend went on to become chief data officer for the State of California, before a stint at McKinsey.\n\nEventually, the lure of starting a new business and the desire to make an impact took hold. \u201cIt came out of exploring a lot of different spaces and then getting excited about the particular idea we had of starting a pure digital asset life insurance company,\u201d Townsend says of the genesis of Meanwhile, co-founded with Max Gasner. Insurance also appeals to the duo\u2019s intellectual curiosity; Townsend calls it \u201can endless series of opportunities that we could explore. We\u2019re not the type of people who start a company that just does one thing forever.\u201d\n\nChief risk officer Annie Tay, on the other hand, describes herself as \u201cyour traditional actuary\u201d. Upon graduating, she joined a life insurance company in Australia, and since qualifying as a Fellow with the Institute of Actuaries, Australia, her multifaceted actuarial career has taken her all over the world, working for multinationals under different jurisdictions. While leading the fintech initiative at the UK\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority, she had the opportunity to work with counterparts from the International Association of Insurance Supervisors on distributed ledger technology and crypto use cases and regulations.\n\nWhen approached to become Meanwhile\u2019s CRO, Tay threw caution to the wind and jumped at the opportunity, looking forward to \u201csomething different and lots of new things to learn.\u201d\n\nThe rise of digital assets\n\nJoining a digital asset-related company, delving into virtual assets such as central bank digital currencies, Bitcoin and other tokens, did not sit well with Tay\u2019s senior actuarial peers in the conventional insurance space. \u201cThey thought I was dealing with criminals!\u201d she says. \u201cSome of my friends think I\u2019m dwelling in muddy territories which may not befit the actuarial profession.\u201d\n\nThe reaction is understandable \u2013 crypto\u2019s reputation has been coloured by its association with shams, scammers and Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, convicted of financial fraud and poor risk management (for example no asset liability management) in the US.\n\nLike it or hate it, Townsend and Tay think that the digital asset business, including Web 3.0, is an important innovation that is poised to serve Millennials and Generation Z. Meanwhile\u2019s choice to start with Bitcoin, in particular, is because it has come a long way since its first block was mined in early 2009; its resilience has reinforced its longevity and technological infrastructure credibility. \u201cThere are folks who are passionate about Bitcoin as a store of value and intergenerational wealth and holding for the long term,\u201d says Townsend. \u201cThat culture is incredibly well aligned with a whole-life policy.\n\n\u201cWe made a deliberate choice from the day we founded this business to work with regulators and do things right,\u201d he continues. Meanwhile is based in Bermuda and regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). \u201cThe BMA is progressive on innovation \u2013 like allowing us to denominate our entire balance sheet in Bitcoin \u2013 but every one of our conversations comes back to protecting and doing right by policyholders and maintaining a robust, sustainable financial system.\u201d\n\nTay draws parallels to the early days of the Chinese insurance industry in the Nineties, pointing out that there were bad actors then, while regulations and enforcement of rules and conduct were still nascent, just as there are unscrupulous characters in the crypto industry now. \u201cThe Chinese insurance industry is now the second largest in the world and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission has come a long way to become one of the most rigorous regulators I\u2019ve worked with,\u201d she says. She believes the digital (virtual) asset industry is currently undergoing a similar transformation, and is confident of its eventual maturation.\n\nThis transformation is exemplified by the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s efforts to regulate previously unregulated entities, potentially ushering in new digital finance business models. Furthermore, numerous jurisdictions, including Japan, Hong Kong, the UAE and the UK, are actively establishing digital asset regulations that will accommodate the evolving landscape of emerging digital infrastructure, assets and liabilities.\n\nFirst principles\n\nWhile being the first digital asset-denominated life company grabs the headline, Meanwhile\u2019s unique selling point is in how it is run. The company is very much tech-driven, and does everything expected of a life insurer, including underwriting, know-your-customer/anti-money laundering screening, reserving, solvency management, investment and risk management. This requires a different approach from that of traditional insurers. \u201cEvery person on the team is experienced, able and willing to do the work, and to think about their work from first principles,\u201d says Townsend, adding that talent \u201cdensity\u201d (talent and capability per employee) matters more than headcount.\n\n\u201cThinking from first principles\u201d and \u201cquestioning requirements\u201d are sensible, even obvious, endeavours \u2013 but are easier said than done. Tay believes traditional insurers are capable of approaching problems from first principles but face challenges due to complex legacy systems, cumbersome processes, a risk-averse culture and daunting transformation costs, leading to uncertain outcomes in their change programmes. This can hinder ambition for real innovation.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other hand, has had the benefit of starting with a clean slate and a relatively simple product, allowing the team to simplify and implement the most efficient system at each step of the product lifecycle. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do one thing well,\u201d says Townsend. \u201cThat\u2019s a benefit of having a background in technology \u2013 there\u2019s a comfort with starting with something minimal and then expanding.\u201d\n\n\"Anyone who's doing something innovative in insurance does not just have a need for actuaries but is also a magnet for them\"\n\nSame problems, different paradigm\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price, denominated in fiat currencies, has been notoriously volatile. Meanwhile is largely immune to these wild swings, as its Bitcoin-denominated liabilities (customers\u2019 claims) are backed by Bitcoin. The decision to hold Bitcoin-denominated assets to back liabilities does come with a problem familiar to actuaries \u2013 reinvestment risk. \u201cOur liabilities are measured in decades,\u201d says Townsend. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for us to get assets with more than one year maturity at scale.\u201d He adds that asset interest term structure risk is the biggest contributor to Meanwhile\u2019s solvency capital requirement.\n\nTo earn a yield on the Bitcoin received from customers, Meanwhile invests in private assets and lends to qualified crypto market makers (who borrow to provide market liquidity). Most are new and unrated counterparties, requiring extra due diligence and risk assessments. \u201cWe do full credit diligence on them, understanding their overall financial picture, and we avoid institutions whose balance sheet is primarily made up of other crypto tokens,\u201d explains Townsend. Meanwhile is working on digital assets rating criteria with regulated rating agencies, and is also exploring hedging and yield arbitrage strategies with institutional parties.\n\nTay says that risk management \u2013 whether on reinvestment risk, counterparty default risk or operational risk \u2013 at Meanwhile is no different to risk management at a traditional life insurer. \u201cWhat is fascinating is the collaboration with mainstream and non-mainstream institutions like asset managers, credit rating agencies, asset owners and exchanges to figure out the operating model for this new asset class.\u201d\n\nA role for actuaries?\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019d known I was going to start an insurance company, I might have become an actuary!\u201d Townsend jokes. He sees value in hiring actuaries for their expertise in product design, investment, reserving, solvency and risk management. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s doing something interesting and innovative in insurance does not just have a need for actuaries, but is also a magnet for them. When the company was announced, we had a lot of inbound interest from young actuaries.\u201d\n\nHe sees a trend of younger actuaries leaving traditional insurers, where they feel like cogs in machines and are bogged down by mechanical tasks that should have been automated long ago. \u201cEven when you pick a conservative career like being an actuary, it\u2019s no reason not to have an exciting journey,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat is Townsend\u2019s motivation for starting companies? \u201cI want to make a big impact and to positively affect people\u2019s lives at scale.\u201d Tay reminds us that the grass is just as green when it comes to making an impact in innovative sectors as an actuary \u2013 from providing life and property protection products to working on emerging solutions around sustainability, actuaries have an important raison d\u2019\u00eatre.\n\nTay believes actuaries possess the skillsets and the discipline to excel as technology and customers\u2019 needs evolve. However, she emphasises that the pace of change is rapid \u2013 actuaries need to modernise and diversify away from outdated approaches while staying anchored to the core principles of actuarial science. \u201cThe profession could benefit from always having an open mind to embrace and leverage new technology, to enhance our work and help us to make more relevant, impactful decisions.\u201d"

        "content": "Cryptocurrency saw a bull run in the last one week on the back of optimism around Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF). Bitcoin rose 12.5 per cent in the last seven days and was trading at $43,387 on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum rose 12.7 per cent and was trading at $2,356. During the week, Bitcoin rose to $44,000 for the first time in 18 months.\n\n\"Blackrock's spot ETF application received its announced $100,000 seed funding, fueling speculation of an approval, which further boosted the broader markets, resulting in an overall Crypto market cap reaching almost $1.6 trillion,\" said Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead, CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\"For the broader crypto markets, it was a sea of green as the rising tide of Bitcoin lifted all boats, with token-specific developments yielding outsized returns. In the large Caps, Solana's surged past $70, driven by increasing network activity and Total Value Locked (TVL), while the Solana ecosystem's airdrops started strongly with JITO!,\" Chaturvedi added.\n\nMoreover, in reply to a question in Parliament during the ongoing Winter Session, the Centre revealed that as many as 28 virtual digital assets (VDA) or crypto service providers have registered themselves with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).\n\nIn the past two days, however, the crypto market saw minor correction. Experts suggest it may be due to profit booking.\n\n\"In the past day, BTC encountered a dip to $43,000 during the day, pulling back from its swift ascent to nearly $45,000 earlier this week. This suggests that traders opted to secure profits after the largest crypto's breakout from $38,000 a week ago,\" said the research team of crypto exchange CoinDCX.\n\n\"While these patterns aren't uncommon, the possibility of a bull trap has started creeping into the market. This could also possibly usher in short selling in the coming days unless investors continue to persist till ETF approvals come in,\" said Rajagopal Menon, vice president at WazirX.\n\nShivam Thakral, chief executive officer of BuyUcoin suggested that the current market momentum is expected to be sustained owing to positive global macroeconomic factors."

        "title": "Bitcoin Hovers Near $44,000 as Speculative Fever Returns - Cointribune EN",
        "content": "Thu 07 Dec 2023 \u25aa 4 min of reading \u25aa by Evans S.\n\nBitcoin is in a state of euphoria. Driven by growing enthusiasm from professional investors, bitcoin has just surpassed the $44,000 mark, dangerously approaching its all-time high set just one year ago. A telltale sign is the explosion in the volume of futures contracts traded on dedicated platforms. Here\u2019s the explanation.\n\nThe interest in Bitcoin has increased tenfold in a few weeks\n\nIt\u2019s an unmistakable sign. Within 30 days, the open interest (which is the volume of active futures contracts) in bitcoin has skyrocketed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nThe CME, the world\u2019s leading derivatives market, saw its open interest increase from $3.63 billion to $5.20 billion over the period. That\u2019s a whopping 43% increase in one month! This rivals the historical peak of $5.45 billion reached in October 2021.\n\nThis explosion of speculative interest in bitcoin is reminiscent of the previous bull run. Between October and November 2021, open interest had gone from $1.46 billion to $5.45 billion, a tripling in three weeks. During the same period, the price of bitcoin had literally soared, from $45,000 to $68,000.\n\nSo, is this resurgence of buying fever the signal that the market is getting ready to take off again?\n\nConflicting signals\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say. While the speculative appetite for bitcoin certainly seems to be back, it is still too early to know the precise positioning of investors. On derivative markets, it is worth noting that it\u2019s possible to bet on both price increases (by buying futures contracts or call options) and decreases (through short sales).\n\nAccording to the latest report published by the CME, the large players on the platform were still predominantly positioned bearishly at the end of November (20,724 short contracts against 18,979 long). But the situation may have changed since then.\n\n\u201cWhat we cannot see at the moment, is whether these big players have switched from a net selling to a buying stance,\u201d analyzes Tony Sycamore, expert at IG Australia. \u201cIf the market became extremely long, we could fear a sharp reversal in prices.\u201d\n\nBitcoin: Can the Party Last?\n\nBecause the current rally seems to respond to more than just speculative frenzy. According to our expert, the resurgence of bitcoin is closely linked to changes in the macroeconomic environment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer just a matter of ETFs or halving. Bitcoin is starting to take off autonomously,\u201d estimates Tony Sycamore. In the background, the prospect of a monetary easing by the Fed in 2023 makes cryptocurrencies particularly attractive to investors.\n\nAnother unmistakable sign: the CME has just surpassed Binance in terms of open interest. Proof that traditional financial institutions are starting to adopt the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nAdmittedly, not everyone is betting on a lasting rally. A potential approval of spot bitcoin ETFs by the SEC at the beginning of 2023 could trigger a \u201csell the news\u201d movement. But for now, nothing seems to be able to stop the climb of bitcoin. The celebration could last awhile yet\u2026\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our 'Read to Earn' program! Earn points for each article you read and gain access to exclusive rewards.

        "title": "What Is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)? - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)?\n\nCentral bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are a form of digital currency issued by a country's central bank. They are similar to cryptocurrencies, except that their value is fixed by the central bank and equivalent to the country's fiat currency.\n\nMany countries are developing CBDCs, and some have even implemented them. Because so many countries are researching ways to transition to digital currencies, it's important to understand what they are and what they mean for society.\n\nKey Takeaways A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is the digital form of a country's fiat currency.\n\nA nation's monetary authority, or central bank, issues a CBDC, which promotes financial inclusion and simplifies implementing monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nMany countries are exploring how CBDCs may affect their economies, financial networks, and stability.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)\n\nFiat money is a government-issued currency that has no backing from a physical commodity like gold or silver. It is considered a form of legal tender that can be used to exchange for goods and services. Traditionally, fiat money came as banknotes and coins, but technology has allowed governments and financial institutions to supplement physical fiat money with a credit-based model that records balances and transactions digitally.\n\nPhysical currency is still widely exchanged and accepted; however, some developed countries have experienced a drop in its use, and that trend accelerated during the pandemic.\n\nGovernments and central banks worldwide are exploring the possibility of using government-backed digital currencies. When and if they are implemented, these currencies would have the full faith and backing of the government that issues them, just as fiat money does.\n\nThe introduction and evolution of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have created further interest in cashless societies and digital currencies.\n\nGoals of CBDCs\n\nIn the U.S. and many other countries, many individuals don't have access to financial services. In the U.S. alone, 5% of adults didn't have a bank account in 2020. An additional 13% of U.S. adults who had bank accounts, instead used costly alternative services like money orders, payday loans, and check-cashing services.\n\nThe main goal of CBDCs is to provide businesses and consumers with privacy, transferability, convenience, accessibility, and financial security. CBDCs could also decrease the cost of maintenance that a complex financial system requires, reduce cross-border transaction costs, and provide those who currently use alternative money-transfer methods with lower-cost options.\n\nCBDCs would also reduce the risks associated with using digital currencies, or cryptocurrencies, in their current form. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, with their value constantly fluctuating. This volatility could cause severe financial stress in many households and affect the overall stability of an economy. CBDCs, backed by a government and controlled by a central bank, would give households, consumers, and businesses a secure means of exchanging digital currency.\n\nA CBDC also provides a country's central bank with the means to implement monetary policies to ensure stability, control growth, and influence inflation.\n\nTypes of CBDCs\n\nThere are two types of CBDCs, wholesale and retail. Financial institutions are the primary users of wholesale CBDCs, whereas consumers and businesses use retail CBDCs.\n\nWholesale CBDCs\n\nWholesale CBDCs are similar to holding reserves in a central bank. The central bank grants an institution an account to deposit funds or use to settle interbank transfers. Central banks can then use monetary policy tools, such as reserve requirements or interest on reserve balances, to influence lending and set interest rates.\n\n\n\nRetail CBDCs\n\nRetail CBDCs are government-backed digital currencies used by consumers and businesses. Retail CBDCs eliminate intermediary risk\u2014the risk that private digital currency issuers might become bankrupt and lose customers' assets.\n\nThere are two types of retail CBDCs. They differ in how individual users access and use their currency:\n\nToken-based retail CBDCs are accessible with private keys or public keys or both. This method of validation allows users to execute transactions anonymously.\n\nAccount-based retail CBDCs require digital identification to access an account.\n\nIt is possible to develop two types of CBDCs, wholesale and retail, and have them function in the same economy.\n\nIssues CBDCs Address and Create\n\nThe Federal Reserve has identified as critical requirements a CBDC meets, as well as matters that need to be addressed before one can be designed and implemented.\n\nIssues Addressed By CBDCs Free from credit and liquidity risk\n\nLowers cross-border payment costs\n\nSupports the international role of the dollar\n\nAims for financial inclusion\n\nExpands access to the general public Issues Created by CBDCs Financial structure changes\n\nFinancial system stability\n\nMonetary policy influence\n\nPrivacy and protection\n\nCybersecurity\n\nIssues Addressed By CBDCs Explained\n\nEliminates the third-party risk of events like bank failures or bank runs. Any residual risk that remains in the system rests with the central bank.\n\nCan lower high cross-border transaction costs by reducing the complex distribution systems and increasing jurisdictional cooperation between governments.\n\nCould support and protect U.S. dollar dominance; the U.S. dollar is still the most-used currency in the world.\n\n\n\nRemoves the cost of implementing a financial structure within a country to bring financial access to the unbanked population.\n\nCan establish a direct connection between consumers and central banks, thus eliminating the need for expensive infrastructure.\n\n\n\nIssues Created by CBDCs Explained\n\nIf the U.S. financial structure drastically changes, it's unknown how it would affect household expenses, investments, banking reserves, interest rates, the financial services sector, or the economy.\n\nEffects a switch to CBDC would have on a financial system's stability are also unknown. For example, there may not be enough central bank liquidity to facilitate withdrawals during a financial crisis.\n\nCentral banks implement monetary policy to influence inflation, interest rates, lending, and spending, which in turn affects employment rates. Central banks must ensure they have the tools needed to positively impact the economy.\n\nPrivacy is one of the most significant drivers behind cryptocurrency. CBDCs would require an appropriate amount of intrusion by authorities to monitor for financial crimes; monitoring is also important because it supports efforts to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n\nCryptocurrencies have been the target of hackers and thieves. A central bank-issued digital currency would likely attract the same crowd of thieves. Therefore, efforts to prevent system penetration and theft of assets and information would need to be robust.\n\nCBDCs vs. Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe cryptocurrency ecosystems provide a glimpse of an alternative currency system in which cumbersome regulations don't dictate the terms of each transaction. They are hard to duplicate or counterfeit and are secured by consensus mechanisms that prevent tampering.\n\nCentral bank digital currencies are designed to be similar to cryptocurrencies, but they may not require blockchain technology or consensus mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, cryptocurrencies are unregulated and decentralized. Their value is dictated by investor sentiments, usage, and user interest. They are volatile assets more suited for speculation, which makes them unlikely candidates for use in a financial system that requires stability. CBDCs mirror the value of fiat currency and are designed for stability and safety.\n\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies at a Glance\n\nCentral banks in many countries have pilot programs and research projects to determine the viability and usability of a CBDC in their economy. One example of a failed attempt is the United Kingdom's Britcoin, which existed between 2011 and 2019. As of March 2023, there were 11 countries and territories with CBDCs. They are the Bahamas, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, Monserrat, Dominica, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, and Nigeria. Eighteen countries now have a pilot program, including seven of the G20 economies, and 32 countries have a program in development. According to the Federal Reserve, the U.S. is one of those countries that is exploring whether a CBDC \"could improve on an already safe and efficient U.S. domestic payments system.\"\n\nIs CBDC a Cryptocurrency? Though the idea for central bank digital currencies stems from cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, CBDCs aren't cryptocurrencies. A central bank controls a CBDC, whereas cryptocurrencies are almost always decentralized, meaning they can't be regulated by a single authority, such as a bank.\n\nDoes the U.S. Have a CBDC? There is no U.S. CBDC. The Federal Reserve and its branches are researching CBDCs and ways to implement them in the U.S. financial system; President Joe Biden has ordered the development of a national strategy on digital currencies.\n\nIs a CBDC Based on a Blockchain? A CBDC can be based on a blockchain, but it doesn't need to be. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Digital Currency Initiative found in their research that distributed ledgers could hinder the efficiency and scalability of a CBDC.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMany countries are developing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and 11 already have implemented them. A CBDC's main goal is to provide businesses and consumers with privacy, transferability, convenience, accessibility, and financial security. Many individuals throughout the world have no access to bank accounts, so a CBDC would give them a way to be paid, hold their money, and pay bills. CBDCs could also decrease the maintenance a complex financial system requires, reduce cross-border transaction costs, and give people who use alternative money-transfer methods lower-cost options."

Numerous well-known exchanges, including Coinbase and FTX, have been put under scrutiny in the wake of several high-profile failures that shook the industry starting in 2022.\n\nMost recently, the SEC sued Kraken over allegations that it has been operating as an unregistered securities exchange. The Commission claims that it failed to register with regulators and commingled customers\u2019 funds. Binance, another crypto giant, is also undergoing a lengthy legal battle with the SEC due to alleged commingling of customer funds.\n\nWe acknowledge that the current state of the crypto industry may be unsettling and want to assure our audience that the exchanges listed in our top picks have transparent financial backing and robust cybersecurity measures in place.\n\nNonetheless, if you\u2019re looking for the most secure method possible of managing your crypto, we recommend purchasing a cold storage wallet. Our top recommendation for the best hardware wallet can be found in our list of the best crypto wallets.\n\nOur Top Picks for the Best Crypto Exchanges of 2023\n\nCoinbase - Best for Beginners\n\nKraken - Best for Advanced Traders\n\nBitstamp - Best for Low Fees\n\nBisq - Best Decentralized Exchange\n\nPionex.US - Best for Automated Trading\n\nPublic - Best $0 Commission Platform\n\nBest Crypto Exchanges Reviews\n\nBest for Beginners: Coinbase Our Partner Start Investing\n\nPros Intuitive, user-friendly interface\n\nEasy asset purchase process\n\nBroad assortment of educational material\n\nWide selection of cryptocurrencies Cons High fees compared to other popular exchanges\n\nWhy we chose it: We chose Coinbase as the best crypto exchange for beginners because of its easy-to-use interface and extensive educational material on everything from blockchain to web3 and public policy.\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with crypto, chances are you\u2019ve already heard of Coinbase. The exchange is one of the largest and most well-known in the U.S., plus the crypto platform does a great job of lowering the barrier to entry for new investors, with a straightforward onboarding process that eases users into trading.\n\nNavigating the platform and managing crypto is a seamless experience thanks to Coinbase\u2019s simple interface. The exchange also features a comprehensive and accessible variety of learning materials. Users are encouraged to use these resources through the Coinbase Earn program, which teaches how to trade specific assets and rewards users with crypto.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s security features are worth mentioning as well. It offers four types of two-factor authentication, allows customers to store their funds in a vault with time delayed withdrawals, and has an insurance policy to protect custodial accounts of up to $250,000. All this is why Coinbase is ultimately worth trying for beginners, despite its higher fees.\n\nBest for Advanced Traders: Kraken Start Investing\n\nPros Customizable, all-in-one interface with real-time market data\n\nMargin trading available\n\nLow fees and transparent fee schedule\n\nRigorous security standards Cons Not available in New York and Washington\n\nFutures and staking unavailable in the US\n\nLimited number of fiat funding options\n\nWhy we chose it: We chose Kraken as the best crypto exchange for advanced traders because of its generous fee schedule, comprehensive trading tools and robust security.\n\nKraken has been around for a while now, and is well known \u2014 and loved \u2014 by many crypto traders around the world. The exchange supports more than 230 cryptocurrencies and boasts arguably the safest digital ecosystem for trading your crypto. Moreover, its advanced trading platform, Kraken Pro, provides a wealth of tools for experienced crypto traders.\n\nA big reason why Kraken Pro stands out from other platforms is its customizable interface. Users can choose as many trading modules as they want from an extensive list and resize, drag, drop and arrange them to create their ideal layout. Another reason is the platform\u2019s fee schedule, which boasts some of the lowest maker and taker fees we could find.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s security is also nothing to scoff at. All of the companies we included in this list employ stringent security measures, but Kraken\u2019s are remarkable enough that the exchange has never suffered a large-scale hack since it first went online in 2011 \u2014 an accolade that very few exchanges of its size can attest to.\n\nBest for Low Fees: Bitstamp Start Investing\n\nPros Low trading fees and no spreads\n\nSupports multiple fiat currencies\n\nFunds can be withdrawn within 24 hours\n\nRegulated by the New York Department of Financial Services Cons Fewer cryptocurrency offerings\n\nWhy we chose it: We chose Bitstamp as the best crypto exchange for low fees because of its highly competitive maker/taker fees, affordable funding fees and strong cybersecurity.\n\nMany crypto exchanges promise low fees as a way to entice traders to join their platform, but then \u201ccatch\u201d you with expensive transfer and withdrawal fees. This is not the case with Bitstamp, which features inexpensive fees across the board. Withdrawal fees for individual cryptocurrencies are markedly low, and ACH transfers are free of charge.\n\nBitstamp\u2019s maker/taker fee schedule \u2014 ranging from 0.30% to 0.00% and from 0.40% to 0.03% as of December 7 \u2014 stands as one of the most affordable among all the exchanges operating in the US. Moreover, users with a 30-day trading volume of under $1000 don\u2019t have to pay any trading fees at all, which is a considerable boon for less dedicated traders.\n\nBitstamp also has a long track record of operating securely and transparently. One of the oldest crypto exchanges in the world, it was the first crypto exchange to receive a payment institution license in the EU and currently holds a BitLicense issued by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).\n\nBest Decentralized Exchange: Bisq Start Investing\n\nPros Supports trades with a broad selection of coins and traditional currencies\n\nWide variety of payment methods\n\nShort verification process Cons Crypto app only works for notifications\n\nMust trade with Bitcoin or BSQ only\n\nWhy we chose it: We chose Bisq as the best decentralized exchange because it follows the ethos of Bitcoin best by maintaining an open-source platform that is completely decentralized without limiting currency support.\n\nBisq brings the clean, easy-to-use interface and vast coin support of centralized exchanges to a decentralized environment. The platform is built on open-source software, meaning its design is publicly available, and the project is funded by personal savings and donations from its community of users.\n\nBisq doesn\u2019t need a third party to conduct cryptocurrency transactions, nor does it require users to submit personal information to trade on the platform. It\u2019s an excellent alternative for Bitcoin fans looking for a wide variety of coins to trade with, including altcoins like Cardano, XRP, and Dogecoin. In fact, it\u2019s not typical for decentralized exchanges to support so many digital assets.\n\nAdditionally, the platform\u2019s security features, such as multi-signature and a security deposit system, enhance the inherent safety and privacy of decentralized exchanges by ensuring that both parties act honestly and have complete control of their funds during the trading process.\n\nBest for Automated Trading: Pionex.US Start Investing\n\nPros Manual and automated trading options\n\nCompetitive fees on all types of transactions\n\nTutorials, live chat and email customer support\n\nAll bots are cloud based Cons Some bots lack a detailed explanation on the exchange's website\n\nUnavailable in AK, HI, ID, IA, KY, NM, NY, TN and VT\n\nNo fiat withdrawal options\n\nWhy we chose it: We chose Pionex.US as the best crypto exchange for automated trading because of its integrated trading bots, low fees and intuitive interface.\n\nSince its launch in 2019, Singapore-based Pionex has garnered a sizable following online thanks to its affordable fee schedule and selection of 16 built-in trading bots. Pionex.US, the United States franchise of the platform, only allows for spot trading and has just 11 bots available, but remains the most comprehensive automated solution for cryptocurrency trading.\n\nThe bots available on Pionex.US have a variety of functions, including:\n\nBuying at dollar cost average for a one-time sell off\n\nCreating an index and rebalancing your portfolio automatically\n\nVarious strategies for buying low and selling high\n\nAlthough there is no way to practice trading with them using a demo account, most of the bots have an educational video and a detailed explanation on the exchange\u2019s website. Users can also request a 1-on-1 onboarding session to help them understand the bots better.\n\nLastly, like its global counterpart, Pionex.US offers inexpensive maker/taker fees on spot trades. These range from 0.05% to 0% depending on the crypto pairing and apply to trades made manually and by trading bots alike.\n\nBest $0 Commission Platform: Public Download App\n\nPros Regulated by the SEC and FINRA\n\nFractional stock investing available\n\nVolatility reminders on cryptocurrencies\n\nSocial trading lets you see what others are buying and selling Cons Charges a transaction fee for crypto trades\n\nLack of technical charts and research tools\n\nLong waiting time for withdrawals\n\nWhy we chose it: We chose Public as the best $0 commission platform because, in addition to offering affordable trades, the exchange is remarkably easy to use and provides a wealth of educational content.\n\nPublic is a beginner-friendly platform that tries to mix accessible, affordable investing with an approach that puts financial literacy first. It does this by providing users with articles on a wide variety of investment topics, market updates and a daily live show called Public Live, where a panel of experts, analysts and journalists join to discuss market headlines.\n\nIt\u2019s important to mention that Public is not a full-service cryptocurrency exchange. The platform focuses on stocks and ETFs first, meaning it lacks certain tools and operates fundamentally different from an actual crypto exchange. Most importantly, users cannot presently transfer crypto assets into or out of their Public account.\n\nAds by Money. We may be compensated if you click this ad.

Start Investing\n\nOther crypto exchanges we considered\n\nThe following trading platforms are all excellent options, especially for new traders. However, they didn\u2019t make it to our top list because they lack certain core features, are not dedicated crypto exchanges or don\u2019t excel in a particular area.\n\nPros Outstanding cybersecurity infrastructure\n\nLow fees if your account is funded with cash transfers\n\nLarge selection of crypto assets Cons Expensive credit and debit purchases\n\nNo crypto-to-crypto trading options\n\nCrypto.com boasts several noteworthy features, including a non-custodial DeFi wallet, prepaid Visa cards to spend crypto, margin trading and over 250 supported crypto assets. Crypto.com also employs various security measures such as multi-factor identification, offline cold storage and a regulated custodian bank account for traditional currency.\n\nWhy Crypto.com didn\u2019t make the cut: Although Crypto.com is a great crypto exchange, it doesn\u2019t stand out in any particular area. We recommend it for beginners and experts alike, but you may want to consider other exchanges if you\u2019re looking for a more specialized platform.\n\nPros No commissions and minimum account balance\n\nExceptionally easy to use and start trading\n\nHeavily regulated by the SEC Cons No mutual fund and forex trading\n\nLacks educational content and research tools\n\nRobinhood is another commission-free investment platform that caters to beginners and casual investors. Users can trade seven cryptocurrencies in addition to stocks, ETFs, options and more.\n\nWhy Robinhood didn\u2019t make the cut: Robinhood lacks the tools and features of a full-service cryptocurrency exchange. It has also been the target of numerous complaints from users and regulators regarding its dishonest business practices (just last year, the app was fined 70 million by FINRA for misleading consumers).\n\nPros Recurring buys and dynamic price alerts\n\nEnable crypto withdrawals to go only to approved addresses\n\nOutput transaction histories and downloadable account statements Cons Higher trading fees than other exchanges\n\nLimited customer service options\n\nGemini is a well-funded crypto exchange with a reputation for being easy to use. The platform supports 80 crypto to buy, sell and store. It also offers a variety of tools for high-performance traders and boasts excellent security practices.\n\nWhy Gemini didn\u2019t make the cut: Gemini\u2019s fees are markedly higher compared to those of other exchanges. And while the platform\u2019s features make for a good package overall, none of them were impressive enough to earn Gemini a top spot with us.\n\nPros Active investment community, ideal for social trading\n\nSupport crypto staking for some coins\n\nBroad selection of cryptocurrencies Cons Disappointing withdrawal fees and spread fees\n\nCrypto trading not available in all states\n\neToro is a multi-asset investment platform that allows users to trade a variety of assets, including 30 popular cryptocurrencies. The platform\u2019s main highlight is its social trading features, which allows users to create a custom news feed and follow, copy and interact with their favorite traders.\n\nWhy eToro didn\u2019t make the cut: eToro did not make our top list because it\u2019s not a full-service crypto exchange. This means it lacks basic tools and services, such as withdrawing your crypto, and directly depositing, trading or exchanging crypto on the platform.\n\nPros One of the easiest platforms to buy Bitcoin and get started with crypto\n\nLock prices immediately and withdraw quickly\n\nMake and receive mobile payments Cons No insurance coverage from the FDIC\n\nIt cannot be used to make payments internationally\n\nCan only trade Bitcoin; no other crypto available\n\nCash.app is a great option if you just want to test the Bitcoin waters or simply need another platform to do quick bitcoin transactions. Unlike other non-dedicated cryptocurrency exchanges, Cash.app lets you keep custody of your coins. This alone makes it worth a try.\n\nWhy Cash.app didn\u2019t make the cut: Cash.app is not a dedicated crypto exchange and its bitcoin services are bare bones. While it may be an accessible entry point for those interested in crypto (specifically Bitcoin), we cannot recommend it as an exchange for trading in the long term.\n\nBest for...

How exactly do they work? What are the different types of exchange and how do they differ from crypto wallets?\n\nWhat is a crypto exchange?\n\nCrypto exchanges are platforms where users can trade digital currencies for other assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and regular currencies, like U.S. Dollars and Euros.\n\nExchanges are an essential part of the crypto ecosystem because most traditional investment firms do not offer cryptocurrencies in their portfolios. Without exchanges, you would have to find another person willing to trade crypto, agree on an exchange rate and send the coins directly to each other\u2019s wallets \u2014 a somewhat convoluted process.\n\nCrypto staking would also be impossible without the service that exchanges offer. Staking allows crypto holders to earn crypto back for setting aside a portion of the coins or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in their wallet.\n\nCrypto wallet vs exchange\n\nCrypto wallets and exchanges are both essential tools used to manage cryptocurrencies. Wallets are meant to keep your crypto funds safe, whereas exchanges are trading hubs where users convert fiat currencies to digital ones and buy or sell crypto based on current market rates.\n\nCrypto exchanges Crypto wallets Facilitate trading between users Hold the private keys that are necessary to access cryptocurrency on the blockchain Convert fiat currencies into digital currencies Are offered by exchanges and independent developers. Are available 24/7, unlike traditional investment firms Can be an online-only platform, a physical storage device, or incorporate both aspects.\n\nMany crypto exchanges operate their own wallets, so users can start trading crypto as soon as they open their account without having to worry about getting a digital wallet of their own. These are known as web-hosted wallets, and their incorporated exchange is responsible for their security measures.\n\nSerious traders are encouraged to keep an independent cryptocurrency wallet to deposit any coins they aren\u2019t actively trading. This is because you could lose all your digital assets if the exchange is hacked.\n\nAlthough you\u2019ll be responsible for securing, backing up, and managing your own funds, independent digital wallets are a much safer alternative for safeguarding the bulk of your crypto.\n\nHow do crypto exchanges work\n\nMost crypto trading platforms function as a brokerage, acting as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. Users can deposit money into exchanges to buy crypto or deposit their own crypto to trade for other currencies, known as crypto-to-crypto spot trading.\n\nTraders can expect to pay a fee for converting one crypto to another, like when exchanging regular currencies at a bank (for example, converting USD to EUR). In exchange for digital currencies, exchanges may accept a wide variety of payments, including credit card payments, ACH transfers, Visa debit cards, money orders and even gift cards.\n\nDedicated crypto and bitcoin exchanges will allow you to withdraw your crypto funds and transfer them to another wallet of your choice. Others, especially those that focus on other assets, like stocks and ETFs \u2014 including Robinhood and eToro \u2014 only let you purchase the crypto but not transfer it out of their web wallets.\n\nWhat are the different types of crypto exchanges?\n\nCrypto exchanges come in three varieties: centralized, decentralized, and hybrid.\n\nCentralized exchanges (CEX)\n\nCentralized exchanges are the most common and traditional type of crypto exchange. These are owned by private companies and offer investors a platform to trade cryptocurrencies. This type of exchange tends to have higher trade volumes and liquidity and a greater number of trading pairs.\n\nCentralized exchanges are often considered a good option for new crypto traders because of their smoother onboarding and user interface, availability of customer support and insurance should the platform\u2019s systems fail. However, this type of exchange is inherently more vulnerable to hacking attacks, and some users may feel uncomfortable sharing their personal information.\n\nExamples: KuCoin, Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEX)\n\nDecentralized exchanges follow in the spirit of Bitcoin by operating with no central point of control. Servers for this type of exchange are spread throughout computers located across the world, which means if one computer is attacked, the network keeps running.\n\nWhere centralized exchanges operate as brokerages, decentralized exchanges are more like marketplaces. They facilitate peer-to-peer trading and have a less rigid registration process. The main drawbacks of decentralized exchanges include lower trading volume, small liquidity, generally poor user interface, and a lack of customer support.\n\nExamples: Bisq, Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Tokenlon, dYdX\n\nHybrid exchanges\n\nHybrid exchanges aim to overcome the limitations of older exchanges by offering the greater functionality and liquidity of centralized exchanges together with the security advantages of decentralized exchanges.\n\nHybrid exchanges boast fast transaction speeds without compromising their users\u2019 privacy but are still a relatively new development in the crypto world. Time will tell if they will be successful or struggle due to high costs, limited scalability and limited assets.\n\nExamples: Nash, Qurrex, Eidoo, Legolas\n\nUnderstanding crypto exchange fees\n\nCrypto exchanges charge several fees, and it\u2019s not always clear what exactly you\u2019ll be charged for.\n\nThere are two main types of fees to look out for: exchange fees and network fees.\n\nExchange fees\n\nExchange fees are how crypto exchanges make money. In other words, they\u2019re service fees that include:\n\nTrading fees, charged when making transactions and are also called \u201cmaker/taker\u201d fees. Trading fees indicate whether a crypto order provides liquidity to the market or not. These also apply when converting currencies.\n\nDeposit fees, charged when users add money to their account, usually via debit card, credit card, or PayPal instead of through a wire transfer.\n\nWithdrawal fees, charged when withdrawing regular currency or cryptocurrencies from your account.\n\nAccount fees, charged on a regular basis, usually monthly.\n\nNetwork fees\n\nNetwork fees are paid to cryptocurrency miners, who process and secure crypto transactions on the blockchain. Many centralized crypto exchanges incur this cost, though some may allow their users to pay more in miner fees to speed up transaction speeds.\n\nUsers on decentralized exchanges generally have to pay this fee themselves, since there is no third party between them and the crypto miners.\n\nWhat to look for when choosing a crypto exchange\n\nNot all investors have the same priorities when it comes to choosing a crypto exchange. However, for most people, supported currencies, security measures, liquidity, ease of use, and geographic availability should be top of mind.\n\nSupported currencies\n\nSome crypto exchanges support as many as 500 currencies, while others may only support a single coin. Your exchange of choice should allow you to buy and sell any crypto you are interested in trading, be it mainstays like bitcoin and ether or altcoins such as Cardano, Litecoin and Ripple. It should also allow for any fiat-to-currency and currency-to-currency trade pairings.\n\nSecurity measures\n\nCrypto exchanges have become a prime target for cybercriminals. According to Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm and data platform that has worked directly with the U.S. government, crypto hackers stole $3.8 Billion in 2022. Look for a crypto exchange with robust encryption that provides additional lines of defense, such as two-factor authentication and Bitcoin locks.\n\nLiquidity\n\nIn the context of cryptocurrency, liquidity refers to how easily a coin can be converted into cash or other coins. For crypto markets and exchanges, higher liquidity means there are more traders active at any given time, so orders get filled faster. Look for exchanges with high liquidity if quick trades are a priority for you.\n\nEase of use\n\nA clunky user interface is the bane of everyday users when it comes to software applications. Even advanced traders may struggle at times if a crypto app is poorly designed. Before settling on an exchange, try several of them out and see which ones are easier to navigate and trade on.\n\nGeography\n\nNot all crypto exchanges are available in the United States. Some exchanges, like Pionex.US, only operate in certain states. Make sure the crypto exchange you are signing up for is available in your location.\n\nHow to be sure a crypto exchange is legitimate and secure\n\nWhen looking for a crypto exchange, it\u2019s essential to keep an eye out for fake websites and mobile apps. Always check for any misspellings in the copy or inauthentic branding. In the case of a website, make sure there\u2019s a small lock icon indicating security near the URL bar.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remind yourself that, scams aside, trading crypto can be dangerous. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, meaning that they are subject to sudden increases and decreases in values that even the wisest investors cannot predict with certainty.\n\nFinancial advisors recommend that if you invest in cryptocurrency, practice caution and keep it below 5% of your total investments.\n\nHow to open a crypto exchange account\n\nEvery crypto exchange has its own registration and setup process. Some exchanges may let you open an account without verifying your identity or submitting sensitive information. Others will require new users to undergo an extensive \u201cKnow your Client\u201d (KYC) process to comply with U.S. government regulations meant to prevent money laundering and fraud.\n\nHowever, some parts of registration are shared across platforms. You will need the following information and documentation to open an account on most crypto exchange platforms:\n\nYour full name and date of birth\n\nYour phone number and email address\n\nYour physical address\n\nYour Social Security number\n\nA government-issued ID (e.g., driver\u2019s license, passport) and a picture of you holding it or a scan of the ID\n\nThe sign-up process generally starts by asking for your personal information, followed by an email to confirm your address. Some exchanges may also ask for a copy of a utility bill sent to your physical address and inquire about your interest in trading crypto. Then, you\u2019ll need to add a payment method to deposit funds into the exchange and start to buy and sell cryptocurrency.\n\nLatest News on Crypto Exchanges\n\nIt\u2019s the best time of the year for bitcoin, as a recent spike in price to over $40,000 has shown. The last quarter of the year is when the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency often see significant surges. However, some experts still question whether there\u2019s any truth to this pattern.\n\nAs crypto markets remain under the radar, speculators are wondering if bitcoin halving will cause crypto prices to soar next year. Bitcoin halving limits the amount of new bitcoins that come into the market by reducing the total reward that miners receive for their work. Halving occurs every four years, and the next one is anticipated to take place sometime around April or May 2024.\n\nThe impact of halving on miners have driven some to ask if bitcoin mining is profitable in the long term. Mining requires a substantial upfront investment, and because there are a lot of variables involved with the practice, a high profit isn\u2019t guaranteed. Escalating energy costs, coupled with the environmental consequences associated with mining, have added to the growing skepticism surrounding the financial viability of mining operations.\n\nCrypto Exchanges FAQs Where can I buy bitcoin? chevron-down chevron-up To purchase bitcoins \u2014 or any cryptocurrency, for that matter \u2014 you'll most likely have to open an account on a crypto exchange. However, this isn't the only way to acquire bitcoin. You can buy bitcoin through some financial apps, such as PayPal and Venmo, and on trading apps like Webull and Cash.app. A few traditional brokers, including Interactive Brokers and TradeStation, also allow bitcoin purchases. Lastly, you can use a Bitcoin ATM, though you will need a Bitcoin wallet for this last method.

Lastly, you can use a Bitcoin ATM, though you will need a Bitcoin wallet for this last method. Why is crypto down? chevron-down chevron-up Cryptocurrencies are down because they are subject to the same factors that are currently impacting stocks and other financial assets. Growing inflation, higher interest rates \u2014 making it more expensive for businesses to borrow money \u2014 and events like the war in Ukraine have destabilized the global economy. This has spilled over into the crypto market, which is already infamous for its high volatility, but has seen some growth in the last couple of months. What is the best crypto exchange? chevron-down chevron-up There is no one best exchange for every user. However, some of the features shared by the best cryptocurrency exchanges include solid security tools, low fees, several payment options, an accessible platform and availability on both mobile and desktop. A large number of tradable cryptocurrencies that include various altcoins, stablecoins and trading pairs \u2014 for example, Bitcoin/Litecoin (BTC/LTC) and Ethereum/Bitcoin Cash (ETH/BCH) \u2014 is also something to look for.

This has spilled over into the crypto market, which is already infamous for its high volatility, but has seen some growth in the last couple of months. What is spot trading in crypto? chevron-down chevron-up Spot trading in crypto refers to buying crypto assets and waiting for them to rise in value before selling them. It\u2019s called \u201cspot trading\u201d because it takes place over a spot market or exchange, which is a public financial platform where commodities, currencies and securities are traded for instantaneous delivery. This is the most common form of crypto trading and is what the majority of people associate with the term \u201ctrading\u201d when they think of cryptocurrencies.\n\nOur Methodology for Choosing the Best Crypto Exchanges\n\nWe looked at over 20 crypto exchanges and evaluated them based on cost, security, and user experience. Other factors we considered in our methodology include their cryptocurrency selection, payment options and trade volume.\n\nWe mainly focused on dedicated crypto exchanges and then looked at trading platforms that let you trade other securities. The best cryptocurrency exchanges scored high in the following categories:\n\nSecurity\n\nUsers should feel that their crypto is secure on their trade platform, so security breach prevention measures and safe account management methods are essential. We looked at each platform\u2019s history of keeping their users\u2019 funds and information safe and considered whether they offer insurance to users in case they lose their money due to a mistake on their part.\n\nSecurity Breach Prevention\n\nIn order to proactively safeguard user accounts against hackers, exchanges may schedule penetration tests, bug bounties and third-party audits to validate the company\u2019s proof of reserves. These assessments help exchanges ensure that their platform lacks vulnerabilities and is equipped with the latest security measures.\n\nSafe Account Management\n\nCrypto exchanges should follow cybersecurity security best practices to limit vulnerabilities in their system. This includes enforcing TLS/SSL encryption and, for centralized exchanges, multi-factor authentication (MFA), which requires the user to provide two or more verification factors \u2014 SMS and email, for example.\n\nUser Experience\n\nAn exchange that is easy to use and navigate is always a plus regardless of whether one is a novice or an expert. We considered each crypto exchange\u2019s mobile (iOS and Android) and desktop interface, favoring those with more intuitive designs. We also looked at the educational content and research tools available for users.\n\nMobile and Desktop Interface\n\nModern crypto exchanges tend to have a more streamlined user interface that is accessible to new traders. This is true even for decentralized exchanges, which have historically been designed for more experienced users.\n\nEducational content\n\nEducational content is helpful for all levels of traders, but especially for those new to crypto, who may need to find their bearings before they begin investing. This type of content ranges from blog articles and explainers on specific coins to test runs and guided transactions for learning how to use an exchange.\n\nResearch Tools\n\nMarket data is an indispensable resource for crypto investors. Research tools allow users to fine-tune their crypto search results by limiting them to specific types of coin and sorting based on a variety of metrics, such as market cap, daily price changes and social trends.\n\nCost\n\nFees can be a headache for users, especially for active traders. We favored crypto exchanges that offered low service fees and ways of reducing transaction fees. We also valued transparency when it came to their fee structure.\n\nLow or reduced fees\n\nMany popular crypto exchanges employ a declining fee schedule where the greater your order volume, the less you have to pay for the transaction. Some exchanges will lower fees further if you\u2019re trading with their native token \u2014 Cronos (CRO) on Crypto.com or Binance Coin (BNB) on Binance.us, for instance \u2014 or even waive fees altogether for high-volume orders.\n\nFee structure transparency\n\nAll crypto exchanges \u2014 dedicated or not \u2014 must openly share their fee schedules. This was a prerequisite for us when it came to featuring companies on our list. Some exchanges have more complex fees than others, in which case we also considered how well they explain these fees and their exceptions.\n\nSummary of Money\u2019s Best Crypto Exchanges of 2023"

        "title": "Bitkey lead calls Canada an important market as Block launches new self-custody Bitcoin wallet - BetaKit - Canadian Startup News",
        "content": "Block bills Bitkey as a simpler alternative to other self-custody Bitcoin storage options.\n\nAmerican payments giant Block has officially launched Bitkey, a new self-custody wallet aimed at giving cryptocurrency owners more control over their Bitcoin.\n\nThe new product is now available for pre-order in 95 countries including Canada\u2014an important market for the firm, according to Bitkey\u2019s business lead. Shipping is set to begin in early 2024.\n\nIn an interview with BetaKit, Bitkey business lead Lindsey Grossman said that the idea is to provide Bitcoin holders with a safe and secure storage alternative to crypto trading platforms that is simpler and easier to use than existing self-custody solutions.\n\n\u201cPeople are stuck in the middle of two very bad options.\u201d \u2013 Lindsey Grossman, Bitkey business lead at Block\n\n\u201cThe problem today that we see in the market is that the vast majority of the millions of Bitcoin owners today keep their Bitcoin on exchanges,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem with this\u2014by leaving your money on exchanges or custodial platforms\u2014is that you put all of your trust in these companies and additionally, they, not you, set the rules on what you can do with your money.\u201d\n\nFor those who have not been content with keeping their Bitcoin on these platforms, other self-custody crypto wallets have existed for some time. But according to Grossman, many are \u201cextremely hard to use\u201d and \u201cway too complex\u201d for the average Bitcoin owner.\n\n\u201cPeople are stuck in the middle of two very bad options,\u201d argued Grossman.\n\nIn light of this, Grossman said that Block decided to build Bitkey for a broader audience. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be an expert engineer, you don\u2019t have to be a Bitcoin [maximalist] to be able to take control of your money,\u201d she added.\n\nGrossman noted that Block sees Canada as a particularly important market for Bitkey, citing the country\u2019s Bitcoin adoption and mobile financial app use as two factors informing this viewpoint. In Canada, Grossman said that most Bitcoin owners are currently saving long-term, but over time, she expects to see Bitcoin usage for other applications, such as payments, grow.\n\nBlock\u2019s Bitkey solution consists of three components: a mobile app that allows customers to make Bitcoin transactions, track their balance, and manage security preferences, a hardware device, and a set of recovery tools. The product costs Canadians a one-time fee of $220 CAD.\n\nRELATED: WonderFi-owned Bitbuy acquires customers of fellow Canadian crypto exchange Bitvo\n\nThe Bitkey wallet has three keys, any two of which are required to move Bitcoin and approve security-related changes. The app contains one, while another key is held in the offline hardware device, which offers users an added layer of security to authorize money movement, and facilitates recovery if customers lose their phone. The third is stored on Bitkey\u2019s server and is used to help customers move Bitcoin with just their phone while on the go and recover their wallet if they lose their phone, hardware, or both\u2014in which case, this key alone would suffice to initiate the recovery process.\n\nAccording to Grossman, Bitkey\u2019s \u201ctwo-of-three multi-signature\u201d approach does away with the need for customers to remember long passwords or \u2018seed phrases,\u2019 which have been a barrier to self-custody wallet adoption for some folks.\n\nIn a crypto context, self-custody refers to the practice of individuals holding and managing their own Bitcoin, rather than relying on a third party, like a bank or crypto exchange, to do so.\n\nGrossman said that to date, customers Block has spoken with in a variety of countries have expressed anxiety about storing their Bitcoin on crypto exchanges. \u201cThey experienced frustrating limits and delays with their money, hidden fees, and as history has sadly shown us in the past, sometimes \u2026 companies they entrust do not act responsibly with customers\u2019 money.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Coinbase says it wants to be a long-term leader in Canada\u2019s crypto market\n\nThe rollout of Bitkey comes just over a year after the collapse of a number of large, high-profile crypto firms, including the exchange FTX, which mishandled customer funds. When the market crashed and companies like FTX went under, a lot of crypto investors lost a lot of money. In the aftermath of this activity, Grossman said the conversation around self-custody shifted.\n\nAccording to Grossman, Block has been developing Bitkey since earlier than that, starting in the summer of 2021. The company later spent six months beta-testing Bitkey in 40 countries, including Canada.\n\nWith its stock price down over 80 percent from its 2021 peak, Block has been under pressure recently. Block co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey has expressed that he wants to see \u201ca significant return to growth\u201d for Block, which owns point-of-sale suite Square and payment platform Cash App. Bitcoin has already been a growth avenue for the FinTech firm.\n\nBitkey\u2019s launch coincides with a notable rebound in crypto markets following a challenging 2022. Bitcoin has rallied more than 120 percent this year, leaving some in the sector optimistic about a potential 2024 bull run.\n\nThis rise has already benefitted Block, which holds Bitcoin in its corporate treasury and has seen an uptick in the volume of Bitcoin sold to its customers via Cash App.\n\nFeature image courtesy Block."

        "content": "The so-called bitcoin halving reduces the number of tokens that bitcoin miners receive to help cap supply at 21 million tokens. In each of the last three events, the coin hit a record.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, cryptocurrency markets recorded a total market value of $US1.6 trillion ($2.4 trillion) on Friday, with bitcoin reaching a market cap of $US847.2 billion on a 24-hour trading volume of $US27.7 billion.\n\nThe oldest cryptocurrency has now rocketed 175 per cent in 2023 and is on track to be the best-performing major asset this year, thumping the returns on traditional assets such as stocks, gold and bonds.\n\nThe renewed appetite has been largely attributed to expectations the US Securities Exchange Commission will approve a bitcoin ETF in January, which will pave the way for Wall Street players such as BlackRock and Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest to market the funds to massive swaths of new investors.\n\nDumping Binance\n\nCaroline Bowler, chief executive of ASIC-regulated exchange BTC Markets, said Binance customers had withdrawn more than $US2.3 billion from the troubled exchange in seven days after the founder pleaded guilty to US charges that included allowing transactions with terrorist group Hamas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Zhao\u2019s guilty plea also followed the conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO of now collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, in a high-profile trial in October.\n\nBTC Markets CEO Caroline Bowler said the exchange trousered $6.5 million of inflows just from Binance clients in the week following its November 21 plea deal. Oscar Colman\n\nMs Bowler said BTC pocketed $6.5 million of inflows from Binance users alone between November 21 to November 28, with total crypto inflows to the exchange soaring 122 per cent on the prior comparable week in 2022.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t happy about what they heard from Binance,\u201d said Ms Bowler. \u201cThe Australian exchanges are now viewed by Australian investors as a flight to safety in times of uncertainty. We saw inflows in May of last year when Terra Luna collapsed and people are cautious after what happened with FTX.\u201d\n\nShe added that the federal government\u2019s proposal for cryptocurrency exchanges to obtain an Australian Financial Services License could make the sector more appealing to institutional investors and foster mainstream adoption.\n\nMs Bowler said the strong inflows had extended into December to elongate a steady upswing in crypto trading volumes and markets after a horror end to 2022, bookmarked by the collapse of FTX."

Bloomberg\n\nThe remarks add to Mr Dimon\u2019s long history of bashing digital currencies, which he has previously called \u201cPonzi schemes\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d.\n\nHis latest comments follow a series of hacks and scandals in the crypto industry, which has been under increased scrutiny from US regulators and legislators since the unwinding of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s cryptocurrency platform.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, used the hearing to team up with Republicans and banking leaders to take aim at the crypto industry."
