        "title": "Bitcoin approaches $38,000 and Ethereum crosses $2,000 as ETF fever continues to buoy the crypto market - Fortune",
        "content": "The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continued to push past year-long highs, as Bitcoin approached $38,000 late Thursday morning, an approximately 7% increase in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Its peak of $37,935 was the highest the coin has reached in more than 18 months.\n\nEther, the token for the Ethereum blockchain and second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was also up, crossing the $2,000 mark for the first time since July on the back of an 8% day-over-day price upswing.\n\nThe market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies increased approximately 5.4% day-over-day to $1.45 trillion, as some of the other largest coins on the market saw large gains as of Thursday morning, including Cardano (8.2%), Solana (9.9%), and Chainlink (12.7%). The movements in the crypto markets far outpaced the stock indices, with the NASDAQ and S&P 500 basically flat over the past 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent upswing is mainly due to \u201coptimism around a near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approval and a resulting short-squeeze,\u201d Brian Rudick, a senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told Fortune, referring to a Bitcoin-based financial product that traditional investors can trade. And on Thursday morning, BlackRock registered the name \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust\u201d in Delaware, an indication \u201cthat it is likely to file a spot ether ETF application soon,\u201d he added.\n\nDavid Lawant, head of research at crypto brokerage and trading platform FalconX, echoed Rudick\u2019s assessment. Bitcoin \u201ccontinues to perform well as the market focuses on the U.S. spot ETF approval process,\u201d he told Fortune, adding that the \u201cbig star of the day\u201d has been Ethereum, following news of BlackRock\u2019s registration of the \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust\u201d name.\n\nThe rapid rise in the prices of major cryptocurrencies continues a month-long rally in the digital assets market. The total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies has rocketed about 30% since Oct. 9, rising alongside optimism over the likely approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, or exchange-traded fund.\n\nTraditional investors, who manage trillions of dollars in capital, are largely constrained by the investment products available on portfolio management platforms like Vanguard or TD Ameritrade. If the Securities and Exchange Commission were to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, which lets traditional investors trade on current Bitcoin prices, crypto industry boosters are betting that tremendous amounts of capital would flow into the Bitcoin\u2014and crypto\u2014markets.\n\nWhile the industry has repeatedly tried and failed to convince the SEC to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, filed an application for its own spot Bitcoin ETF in June. Since then, the crypto markets have rallied, and other financial institutions have filed their own ETF applications, hoping to cash in if the SEC were to approve the application from BlackRock, which has a sterling record of past ETF approvals.\n\nAnd starting Thursday, a brief period for the SEC to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF opened, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts, who believe that, even if approvals don't come in November, there is a 90% chance of approval by January.\n\n\"There is significant hype surrounding the recent comments from Bloomberg regarding the ETF 'window,'\" James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, told Fortune. \"Admittedly, it is always a little worrying when prices rise so sharply. That said, as we enter into this new bull market, it is worth reflecting on the point that we remain well below the all-time-highs seen in 2021.\""

        "title": "Has El Salvador's bitcoin gamble paid off? - Marketplace",
        "content": "A sign outside the Good Beans coffee shop in San Salvador advertises that it accepts bitcoin. (BBC)\n\nAt a small coffee shop in San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador, customers come for freshly made coffee and packets of high-quality beans. And some pay in bitcoin.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has been legal tender in the Central American country for more than two years. Businesses are officially required to accept bitcoin, but patchy technology, limited internet access and a lack of enforcement means that only some do.\n\nCoffee shop owner Gabe Gutierrez believes taking bitcoin payments has helped him attract customers.\n\n\u201cIn a normal month, 5% to 10% of our sales are in bitcoin. The business impact has been very positive in that sense,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s bringing in revenue, but it\u2019s not only that. It\u2019s more convenient.\u201c\n\nPresident Nayib Bukele argued that adopting bitcoin would reduce dependence on the country\u2019s other currency, the U.S. dollar, and make it cheaper to send and receive remittances \u2014 when migrants send home money to their family.\n\nBut in the first six months of 2023, according to El Salvador\u2019s central bank, only around 1% of received remittances were in bitcoin. Many Salvadorans, like Delmy Bran, aren\u2019t using the currency.\n\n\u201cIf they educated the people in how to use the currency, then maybe we could,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers like Bea Tenorio think the government\u2019s decision was irresponsible. \u201cA country needs medicine in the hospitals, resources in the schools. I don\u2019t think those of us at the bottom will see the benefits of it.\u201d\n\nEl Salvador has lost an estimated $40 million of its total investment in bitcoin since 2021 due to a decline in the value of the cryptocurrency. Carlos Acevedo, an economist and former president of El Salvador\u2019s Central Reserve Bank, doesn\u2019t think bitcoin is suitable as legal tender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like playing Monopoly in the casino. You can win, you can lose \u2014 and we have had bad luck so far \u2014 but for people who are poor, they cannot afford to take a drop in 5%, 10% in one day.\u201d\n\nBut the government is continuing to push bitcoin. It recently announced that bitcoin education would be compulsory in schools starting next year. People from other countries are also moving to El Salvador to use the cryptocurrency, like James Turner and Nicky Malcom of New Zealand.\n\n\u201cSo I receive 100% of my income at the moment as bitcoin, which we then manage that to live our life here,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe use it to buy our groceries,\u201d added Malcom.\n\nCharlie Stevens moved here from Ireland. \u201cI use bitcoin to trim my beard, for coffees, for gas, for cooking, I use it for my motorbike, and that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nWhile some say El Salvador\u2019s bitcoin project hasn\u2019t succeeded, others believe it\u2019s only just beginning."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged above $37,000 Thursday morning to its highest price in 18 months, a rally fueled by more optimism that regulators could soon approve the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nAs of 12 p.m. ET it had slipped below $37,000 but was still up nearly 3% over the last 24 hours.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has now gained more than 32% over the past month and 120% since the beginning of January.\n\n\"There is no question that the very positive action in bitcoin this year continues to be very impressive,\" Matt Maley, chief market strategist with Miller Tabak + Co., wrote in a Thursday morning note.\n\nIt is still far from an all-time high, however. Bitcoin peaked at $68,789 in November 2021 but then crashed in 2022 as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates and a series of firms imploded, including crypto exchange FTX in November 2022.\n\nA widespread crackdown on the crypto industry followed. Regulators sued a number of big players, including Coinbase and Binance, and last week a jury convicted FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of defrauding customers, lenders, and investors.\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nNow investors are newly optimistic that the industry is poised for more mainstream acceptance. They are hoping the Securities and Exchange Commission will soon grant approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, which would allow investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) is among the big-name money managers that have recently applied to launch such a product.\n\nBlackRock is the world's largest money manager. (STRF/STAR MAX/IPx) (STRF/STAR MAX/IPx)\n\nGrayscale Investments wants the SEC to sign off on the conversion of its bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund following an August decision in its favor from a three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.\n\nThe panel concluded the SEC had been \"arbitrary and capricious\" when it denied Grayscale's conversion application in 2022.\n\nGrayscale has since picked up discussions with the SEC\u2019s divisions of markets and trading and division of corporate finance, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next official milestone where the SEC must accept or reject approval for a spot bitcoin ETF is Jan. 10. But the SEC could approve applications sooner.\n\n\u201cAny timing is absolutely speculative,\u201d this person added.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s surge on Thursday also pushed the stocks of digital asset companies higher. Coinbase (COIN), the largest US crypto exchange, rose 8% while MicroStrategy (MSTR) was up 7%. Meanwhile, Marathon Digital (MARA) surged 11%.\n\nCrypto stocks had given back some of their gains by midday.\n\nBitcoin appears to be getting \u201cvery overbought,\u201d Maley said, suggesting it may soon see a pullback. However, its mid-week surge hasn\u2019t seen the momentum loss of previous rallies this year, he added.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of breakout move that frequently leads to an even bigger advance before long,\u201d Maley said.\n\nTo be sure, bitcoin and the crypto markets are heavily driven by derivatives trading and that can exaggerate market activity in either direction.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, crypto trading volume has doubled to $87 billion as of noon New York time. For the same period, $132 million in trader positions shorting bitcoin have been liquidated, according to crypto derivatives source Coinglass.\n\nThe size of total short liquidations is far smaller than past so-called short squeeze fueled rallies that bitcoin has experienced this year, suggesting that more investors are directly buying the underlying/spot asset.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for the latest crypto news, updates, values, prices, and more related to bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin, DeFi, and NFTs\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "ETF optimism had been building earlier in the morning, with bitcoin climbing and giving a big lift to crypto assets across the market to start the day. The rise in bitcoin price triggered a wave of short liquidations overnight, which propelled crypto prices higher, said Clara Medalie, head of research at crypto data provider Kaiko.\n\nThe website for Delaware's Division of Corporations showed that an iShares Ethereum Trust was registered on Thursday. A similar notice for the iShares Bitcoin Trust came on June 8, one week before BlackRock's filing for a bitcoin ETF. BlackRock declined to comment on the matter.\n\nEther was last higher by nearly 7.48% at $2,037.61, according to Coin Metrics. Meanwhile, bitcoin added 2.67% to trade at $36,574.83. Earlier, it climbed as high as $37,970, its highest level since May 2022.\n\nThe price of ether jumped Thursday, topping the key $2,000 level for the first time since April, after BlackRock took initial steps toward filing for a spot ether ETF.\n\n\"Over the past year, crypto markets have been desperately searching for a catalyst amid a sea of bad news, and the ETF news have been a welcome respite,\" she said. \"Should [an ETF approval] come, we may see another big surge, or we could be witnessing the extent of it right now. Ultimately, it is too early to tell if the rally has legs, but things look promising.\"\n\nHowever, with the exception of ether, prices across the crypto market retreated midday. Ryan Rasmussen, analyst at Bitwise Asset Management, noted that leverage and open interest ballooned on the sharp move towards $38,000 and then evaporated almost instantly on the pullback.\n\n\"That's a reflection of traders on both sides \u2014 bulls and bears \u2014 getting whipsawed by the sharp price movements,\" he said. \"Any time leverage builds like that in either direction, it's at risk of getting wiped out. I think it's fair to expect more volatility as prices rise \u2014 bull markets don't go up in a straight line.\"\n\nBitcoin has seen $134.41 million in short liquidations over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass, and $41.12 million in long liquidations in the same period.\n\nOther crypto assets rode the bitcoin price wave Thursday, also coming off their highs of the day. Solana , one of the biggest outperformers in crypto this year, added 2.69% after jumping 11% earlier. Most other tokens gave back earlier gains and ended the day flat.\n\nSeparately, FTT, the token tied to the now defunct FTX, spiked by 51% after SEC chair Gary Gensler told CNBC a revival of the exchange could work if new leadership does so with a clear understanding of the law.\n\nIn equities, shares of crypto services provider Coinbase and bitcoin proxy Microstrategy gained 5.1% and 4.1%, respectively. Among the bitcoin miners, Marathon Digital was up 8%, while Riot was flat. Both stocks gave back double digit gains.\n\n\u2014CNBC's Jesse Pound contributed reporting.\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\n\nCorrection: The price of bitcoin topped $37,000 for the first time since May 2022. An earlier version of this story misstated the time interval."

        "content": "The wild session comes at a time when BTC and ETH prices have been surging amid Wall Street's burgeoning interest in crypto. Both cryptos surpassed round-number milestones they haven't seen recently. BTC topped $36,000 and then $37,000 for the first time since May 2022 \u2013 and almost reached $38,000 \u2013 before retracing much of the rally. ETH got above $2,000 and hit the highest level since the April Ethereum upgrade known as Shanghai."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe supply of freely circulating bitcoin has tightened to historic lows, as long-term investors are stashing an all-time high amount of the cryptocurrency, according to data from Glassnode.\n\nBy one measure, the amount of held bitcoin in wallets with minimal spending history hit a record of over 15.4 million tokens, the blockchain data platform said. Similar trends can be seen in the net position change of long-term holders, with inflow levels steadily climbing.\n\nAn all-time high is also forming in the spread between long-term holder (LTH) and short-term holder (STH) supply, Glassnode said. It's a sign of how tight the market is becoming, demonstrating that short-term buyers are unlikely to find many sellers willing to part with their holdings.\n\n\"LTHs historically wait for the market to break to new price [all-time highs] before ramping up their distribution,\" the report said. \"This process can be seen by the large scale decline in their supply during the 2021 bull run, which is matched by an uptick in STH Supply, as well as Exchange inflow volumes.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis resistance to selling comes on expectations that bitcoin will eventually breach earlier price highs. That comes as possible regulatory approval of a spot bitcoin ETF as well as bitcoin's April halving are fueling investor optimism.\n\nThese same factors are driving increasingly bullish calls on bitcoin's trajectory, with investing firm Bernstein recently projecting the token to hit $150,000 by mid-2025.\n\nGlassnode suggested that bitcoin's current price levels are of interest, given that most short-term held coins have become profitable since the token breached $30,000. This may fuel a transfer of coins to new investors, especially if the price declines from its current $35,000 level."

The crypto has gained roughly 122% this year and 134% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe rally follows months of start-stop momentum surrounding the Securities and Exchange Commission's talks with financial firms over the potential approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. Late Wednesday, reports emerged that the regulator had opened fresh talks on the matter with Grayscale, a digital asset company that recently secured a legal victory against the SEC in its attempt to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nStrategists at Bloomberg Intelligence forecasted a 90% chance of approval for a spot ETF in the US by January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcitement over a spot ETF has been building all year, and applicants from fund management giants like BlackRock are waiting in the queue for approval by the SEC.\n\nMeanwhile, CoinDesk reported Thursday that a four-hour period in early Asian trading hours showed short-sellers liquidating nearly $50 million in bitcoin positions, sparking a \"short squeeze\" that helped the day's rally gain steam.\n\nAlso helping to drive the price higher is a low supply of bitcoin currently on the market. The supply of bitcoin in circulation is extremely low, according to Glassnode, with long-term investors holding onto their stash as the wait for prices to rise further. One figure suggests the amount of held bitcoin in wallets with minimal spending history recently hit a record of over 15.4 million.\n\nFurther out on the horizon, bitcoin's so-called \"halving\" event is expected to occur sometime in the middle 2024, which some industry veterans have said could eventually push the token's price above $100,000. \"Halving\" in crypto happens when the number of bitcoins rewarded to miners is cut in half.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach of the prior three halvings were followed by new all-time highs within 12 months."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged past $37,000 early Thursday, its highest level in 18 months. The cryptocurrency's gains come amid speculation that the SEC may finally approve a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nYahoo Finance Senior Reporter Jared Blikre analyzes the factors behind bitcoin's rise, observing patterns in other cryptocurrencies as the digital asset market aims to stage a recovery from recent crashes.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: Well, Bitcoin is climbing higher today, hitting its highest level that we've seen in about 18 months, sitting just shy of 37,000 on renewed hopes of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre standing by on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the latest. Jared.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes, 37,000, really impressive. Let's go to the Wi-Fi interactive and talk about this Grayscale Bitcoin, which is about to become an ETF. The SEC lost that court case and there are a bunch of other spot ETFs-- spot Bitcoin ETFs that are just waiting to come into the market from BlackRock and a bunch of different ETF providers. So lots of hype surrounding that.\n\nAnd if we take a look at the chart, you can see 37,500 and change here. We have really accelerated off of this base here. So not much was happening for a few months. And then, suddenly, we got what some people are calling a God candle that would be right here. And now, we're clearing resistance. 35,000 was a big number. Now we're up to 37,000.\n\nLet me just show you a three-year chart so we can see where some of the price memory is. We're really in the thick of it right now at the lower end down here. But you can see tons of price memory all the way up to about 65,000-70,000. So the short story is there's a long way to go.\n\nBut, if Bitcoin is emerging finally from this crypto winter then there's lots of enthusiasm behind it, and perhaps we can clear a lot of these major hurdles. It was only yesterday, I was talking about the FTC's, perhaps, rising from the ashes, there are a number of potential suitors there. Three of which are leading the negotiations. One of which is headed by Tom Farley, who used to be the President of the New York Stock Exchange right here.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut back to the Wi-Fi interactive. Let me just show you what's happened over the last three days so you can really appreciate some of the outsized move that we've seen from some of the smaller tokens. FTT token. That's up 75%.\n\nLet me show you a one year chart. And it kind of looks like a sinusoidal pattern here. Periodic bouts of enthusiasm. I guess not worried that it's going to go to zero at least. We've seen this play out over the last year.\n\nBut if I put a three-year chart, you can really see the damage that was done to this token. It's basically down over 90% over the last two years. There you go, 96%-97%. All told here. It's looking good for the risk market it's not just Bitcoin and crypto, which is being seeing a lot of love.\n\nLet me go to some of our leading markets. If we go over the last three days. Actually, let me pull it up for the last seven that's going to take us back to, I believe, last Wednesday's Fed announcement, which really started the risk engine juice. ARK Invest is up 17.6%.\n\nCannabis up 12%. Gambling up 10%. So this is really all about risk on. And Crypto is just kind of participating, although, it admittedly does have its own fundamentals here, guys."

Analysis of the data found this long-term holder metric is at an elevated level for several BTC -3.23% age bands.\n\nThe data revealed that 68% of the circulating supply of bitcoin has been held untouched for over one year.

Short squeezes occur when the price of an asset jumps higher than expected and short sellers are forced to cover their positions, driving the price higher still.

        "content": "This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d Cryptocurrency is a young asset class that has developed a reputation for price volatility; however, there are ETFs that could help mitigate risk for those investors seeking crypto exposure.\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets\u201d which includes one U.S. dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies, and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Cryptocurrencies Data (through November 7, 2023)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price continued to rise this week, breaking $35,000 for the first time since May 2022. BTC is now up ~111% year to date.

        "title": "This 1 Catalyst Could Send Bitcoin Soaring Back to Its All-Time High of $69,000 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There's a good reason why Bitcoin (BTC -3.82%) has earned a reputation as a tremendously volatile asset. It typically moves in dramatic boom-and-bust cycles, sometimes without any apparent rhyme or reason. After a huge \"bust\" year in 2022, when it lost 65% of its value, Bitcoin has entered a new \"boom\" phase and is up more than 110% for the year.\n\nWhat makes this year's boom so remarkable is that it is not being driven by retail investors. Instead, the driving catalyst for this year's rally appears to be large institutional investors, many of whom are embracing Bitcoin for the first time. And that is leading to some tremendously bullish predictions about where Bitcoin could be headed next, including a potential rally back to its all-time high of $69,000.\n\nSigns of institutional investor bullishness\n\nThe signs of a dramatic change in investor sentiment are everywhere these days. Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley recently opined that \"crypto winter\" could finally be over. A top market strategist at Fidelity Investments recently outlined a new investment thesis calling Bitcoin \"exponential gold.\" Even some top hedge fund managers, who never before invested in crypto, are now waxing poetic about the allure of Bitcoin. Legendary billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, for example, recently said in a Robinhood Fireside Chat, \"I don't own any Bitcoin, to be frank, but I should.\"\n\nWhat's driving the new enthusiasm for Bitcoin?\n\nThere are at least three good reasons for the change in sentiment. The most obvious one is the enthusiasm over the imminent arrival of the first-ever spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). When this product launches, it could result in a tsunami of new money into Bitcoin. Some of the largest institutional investors -- including BlackRock (BLK -2.08%), the largest asset manager in the world -- are behind this surge in new interest in Bitcoin. The conventional wisdom is that even if large institutional investors allocate just 1% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, then it could push up its price significantly.\n\nThe other big reason for the change in sentiment is the overall macroeconomic outlook. Institutional investors are always on the lookout for a hedge against bad things happening in the broader economy, and have settled on Bitcoin as a potential hedge. Bitcoin has been widely touted as a potential hedge against inflation, which is what has earned it the moniker of \"digital gold.\" And earlier this year, the string of regional bank failures led to many institutional investors moving their money into Bitcoin, all in the hopes of avoiding the pain and upheaval happening in the traditional banking system.\n\nAnd, finally, there's building excitement over the Bitcoin halving in April 2024. This unique event, which happens only once every four years, results in the mining reward for Bitcoin miners being cut by one-half. This might sound like a highly technical event, but it has rather profound implications for the future price of Bitcoin. It makes Bitcoin a more deflationary asset (by reducing the rate at which new Bitcoin is being created), and it creates a \"scarcity effect\" around Bitcoin. In three previous halving cycles, Bitcoin has rallied to new all-time highs, and the expectation is for a similar outcome in 2024.\n\nSo what could go wrong?\n\nGiven all of the above, it might seem obvious that Bitcoin has nowhere to go but up. But don't forget: Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset. Put another way, Bitcoin is unlikely to march upward in any kind of obvious pattern. There will be zigs and zags along the way. Some analysts predict that Bitcoin might drop back to $25,000 or even $20,000 from its current level of $35,000. And, when you add in macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, Bitcoin could end up disappointing a lot of bulls over the next 12 months.\n\nThat being said, I remain bullish on Bitcoin over the long haul. The arrival of institutional investors to the Bitcoin party is long overdue, and should continue to push up the price of the world's most valuable cryptocurrency for years, if not decades, to come."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency rally, which had abruptly stalled over the past couple of months, has regained momentum this month, with Bitcoin (BTC) trading above $36,600 on Nov 8. The rally comes amid a spate of developments and soaring optimism around the overall crypto market.\n\nThe bullish trend is expected to continue in the last two months of the year as well. The cryptocurrency market staged a solid turnaround in the first seven months of the year after a disappointing 2022.\n\nHowever, the rally stalled in early August, and prices have been rangebound since then. The fresh rally comes on the heels of some positive news and upbeat investor sentiment following the Fed\u2019s decision to keep interest rates unchanged in the range of 5.25-5.5% in its September and November FOMC meetings back-to-back.\n\nAlthough the Fed said that inflation is still way above its 2% target, which has kept it open for another 25-basis-point interest rate hike this year, fresh jobs data hinted at a cooling labor market.\n\nThis has raised expectations that the Federal Reserve may be done with its monetary tightening campaign.\n\nHigher interest rates typically have a negative impact on growth sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrency. Hence, the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes bodes well for the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThis was all major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) rebounding this month.\n\nAnother factor behind the rally is soaring expectations among investors that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is just on the anvil of approving a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe expected approval by the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF is likely to boost demand, allowing conventional investors to access Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through regular stock markets.\n\nAdditionally, it's expected to attract new investments into the crypto industry, potentially resulting in heightened demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin has now more than doubled this year, and the rally is expected to continue. Year to date, Bitcoin price has soared more than 121.6%.\n\nOur Choices\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023.

        "title": "Happy 15th Birthday Bitcoin: A Glimpse Into Its Groundbreaking Journey and Future Potential - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's been 15 years since that fateful day when Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin (BTC -3.89%) white paper to the world. Indeed, Bitcoin's pseudonymous inventor likely knew this creation was novel and innovative, but who could have imagined that it would usher in a new era of finance?\n\nAs its 15th birthday passes, it's time to take a closer look at why Bitcoin has taken the world by storm, how it has evolved, and where it could be headed.\n\nStarting the crypto movement\n\nThere are thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation today, but it's important to remember that without Bitcoin, most of them wouldn't exist. Bitcoin's creation and open-source code provided developers with a blueprint and starting point to create new cryptocurrencies. Although the cryptocurrency asset class has grown from one to many thousands, Nakamoto's creation remains the clear leader, not only in price but also in technology.\n\nAlthough newer cryptocurrencies often tout features that provide greater scalability or revamped security models, Nakamoto's elegant yet simple design has proven to be the most robust, resilient, and capable blockchain. Boasting a track record of zero hacks and the highest levels of decentralization, Bitcoin remains the quintessential cryptocurrency in a class of its own.\n\nBitcoin's historical evolution\n\nNakamoto created Bitcoin for various reasons in response to the Great Recession. One of the primary motivations mentioned in the white paper was to establish a decentralized payment system that does not require intermediaries, such as banks. While initially designed for transactions and still technically able to be used in this fashion, Bitcoin has evolved to become a preferred option for storing wealth in a decentralized system. Unlike fiat currencies that are subject to devaluation, Bitcoin provides another way to store wealth. Thanks to Bitcoin's sound monetary policy and finite supply, Nakamoto's creation has become a viable means for holders to preserve value.\n\nNot only have Bitcoin's use cases evolved with time, but so has the code itself. While Nakamoto would still recognize the original Bitcoin, there have been a series of upgrades known as Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) implemented over the past decade and a half that have enhanced Bitcoin's functionality. Two of the most popular BIPs have been dubbed SegWit and Taproot.\n\nWith the release of SegWit in 2017, Bitcoin transactions became faster and cheaper by changing how data is stored. Building off of SegWit, the Taproot upgrade was approved in 2021 to enhance privacy and smart contract capabilities by making all transactions appear uniform on the blockchain, a long sought-after feature. Best of all, even after all the improvements, Bitcoin still retains its fundamental features of decentralization and security, all while becoming more capable and efficient.\n\nLooking ahead: Bitcoin's ongoing journey\n\nIt has been a long and historic journey for Bitcoin -- and yet it is likely only beginning. What was once an obscure cryptocurrency used by tech enthusiasts has gone from processing just a few hundred daily transactions to more than 700,000. This extraordinary rise in adoption is now garnering attention from Wall Street juggernauts like BlackRock and Fidelity as they vie for approval for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Not to mention, countries like El Salvador have embraced Nakamoto's creation as an official form of currency.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is breaking through barriers in traditional finance, developments are occurring on a new frontier that could increase Bitcoin's prominence. In May 2023, Bitcoin got another new use case with the introduction of Ordinals. As a way for users to essentially mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Ordinals signify the growing interest in Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi). With the current DeFi economy worth more than $43 billion today, Bitcoin has been unable to participate in this burgeoning market due to limitations in its code. But with Ordinals and other technological developments such as Layer-2 blockchains like Stacks, the likelihood of Bitcoin entering DeFi is increasingly likely and could unleash pent-up capital in novel ways.\n\nSupply, demand, and Bitcoin's ascent\n\nAs more individuals, institutions, and even countries adopt Bitcoin, the demand for its limited supply of 21 million coins is intensifying. This trend makes it difficult to predict an exact target price for Bitcoin. However, one thing is clear -- the simple supply and demand dynamics suggest that the value of Bitcoin will rise.\n\nRather than speculating on Bitcoin's exact price target, it is best to focus on its significance, which may well be greater than any projection. With each passing day, Bitcoin is proving its resiliency, discovering new use cases, and filling gaps in the financial system. Therefore, the next 15 years could be even more revolutionary for Bitcoin than the first 15, as Nakamoto's invention paves the way for a new era of financial innovation."

Bitcoin's volatility in 2023 is at its lowest in over a decade. That's according to E coin Metris. The term volatility which measures how much the price of an asset fluctuates often comes with a negative connotation, but that's not always the case investors can experience swings up or down. It's important to remember that there is up potential too. This chart shows Bitcoin's average monthly volatility since 2014. The largest Cryptocurrency by market cap has doubled in value and soared above the $35,000 mark this year. Amid weak liquidity conditions. Yet volatility has been largely absent from the market with rates ranging predominantly between 20 to 40%. It appears Bitcoin investors in 2023 are seeing more payoff compared to previous years. Though perhaps macro and leverage traders are continuing to sit on the fence. Bitcoin is currently trading hands at around $35,200. That's it for today's chart of the day.

In the past month, bitcoin has surged 32% as the SEC appears closer to approving the first bitcoin spot ETF in the US. Investing giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity are leading the efforts to establish such funds.\n\nBut while crypto-enthusiasts have touted the ETFs as a way to acquaint Wall Street's more traditional investors with bitcoin, JPMorgan analysts are unconvinced that this would inject fresh capital into the space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, the spot ETFs would attract investment from existing bitcoin products, such as Grayscale's bitcoin trust, future ETFs, and bitcoin mining companies, which tend to amass the token.\n\n\"We envisage this shift as a relative value trade as several of the above bitcoin products trade at a premium or much reduced discount relative to the past,\" the note said.\n\nAs for new investors, spot ETFs existing in other countries have failed to attract impressive interest, JPMorgan noted. The biggest physically-backed bitcoin fund, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, has been relatively flat since its launch in 2021.\n\nAnalysts also noted that SEC authorization for spot ETFs \u2014 which the agency first challenged in court \u2014 doesn't signal a complete regulatory reversal towards the crypto industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While this year's Ripple vs SEC and Grayscale vs SEC court rulings represent legal defeats for the SEC, it is far from clear that the regulatory tightening of the crypto industry will lessen significantly going forward given how unregulated this industry is,\" the note said. \"US crypto industry regulations are still pending and we do not believe US lawmakers would shift their stance because of the above two legal cases, especially with the memories from the FTX fraud still fresh.\"\n\nUnder Chairman Gary Gensler, the agency has taken a heavy-handed approach in supervising the sector, characterizing it as rife with \"fraud\" and \"hucksters.\"\n\nWhatever the outcome on Wall Street, crypto markets are also getting a boost from bitcoin's upcoming halving cycle in April. This predetermined event lowers the amount of tokens awarded to miners, putting pressure on future supply and inducing a further price rally.\n\nWhile this has historically happened at each halving, JPMorgan says that the halving price is already priced in at bitcoin's current level."

If you're going to keep up with the Magnificent Seven you're going to have to grow your revenues and cash flows at 20% a year or faster ad infinitum,\" Saylor said in a Fox Business interview earlier this week. \"There's seven companies that generate all the shareholder returns. There's 7,000 companies that can't keep up. What we did in August of 2020 was recognize that there's no way we're going to outgrow Google and Microsoft and Apple Computer as a mid-sized software company.\"\n\nSaylor explained that his company began to seek out a \"high-growth digital monopoly\" to invest in, and decided bitcoin was the most promising asset.\n\n\"We realized bitcoin is like a high-tech dominant digital network growing at 40% or 50% a year, and so we bought it,\" he said. \"It's kept growing at 40% to 50% a year, and now we're using our balance sheet to grow the company.\"\n\nBitcoin has rallied sharply in 2023 but can push even higher once regulators approve financial firms' bitcoin spot ETF products, in Saylor's view. Bloomberg Intelligence strategists forecast a 90% chance of approval by January 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"[Bitcoin's] supply and demand are in balance right now, but after the halving in April, the supply gets cut in half,\" Saylor maintained. \"And after the spot ETFs come online, the demand's going to at least double. So the only thing that's going to adjust there is the price in order to get the market to clear.\"\n\nOther players in the digital asset sector have predicted that bitcoin could soar beyond $100,000 as a result of the halving. Each of the prior three halving events for bitcoin were followed by new record-highs in the subsequent 12 months.\n\n\"The next 12 months are pretty auspicious for the asset class,\" Saylor said."

        "content": "Economist Nouriel Roubini popularly known as Dr Doom, long known for his critical stance towards cryptocurrencies, has made a sudden pivot by unveiling his own cryptocurrency. This surprising turn of events has stirred controversy, with Binance co-founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao expressing his disapproval.\n\nWhat Happened: Roubini, who once labeled Bitcoin as a \u201cshitcoin,\u201d belittled Ethereum, and dismissed blockchain technology as no more than a spreadsheet, has now ventured into the world of cryptocurrency with his latest project. However, this unexpected move has not been well received by Zhao.\n\nSome people are shameless. After attacking Binance publicly on stage a year ago, now issues a token and puts #Binance logo on their website WITHOUT permission. \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/WENaTO4tE4\n\n\u2014 CZ \ud83d\udd36 Binance (@cz_binance) November 7, 2023\n\nRoubini\u2019s has ventured into launching a stablecoin. According to the project\u2019s website, the Atlas Climate Token (ACT) is not just a digital investment contract, but an actual blockchain-based stablecoin. The stablecoin is designed to be pegged to a diverse portfolio of tangible real-world assets, including climate-resilient REITs, strategic commodities, inflation-hedged sovereign bonds, and gold, the project website reads.\n\nThe website also reveals that Atlas is currently in active discussions with top-tier ETF issuers and distributors to facilitate the launch of the ETF.\n\nTaking to X, Zhao did not hold back in criticizing Roubini. \u201cSome people are shameless,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWill The SEC Finally Approve Long-Awaited Bitcoin Spot ETF?

This move did not sit well with Zhao.\n\nZhao accused Roubini of including the Binance logo on Atlas Capital\u2019s website without permission. Since Zhao\u2019s tweet, Atlas Capital has removed all external company logos, including that of Binance, from the \u201cTeam\u201d page on its website.\n\nInterestingly, during a CNBC live event in Abu Dhabi last year, Roubini did not mince words when describing Zhao.

The timing of it overtaking Binance, a crypto-focused exchange, is poignant. Wall Street firms like BlackRock are increasingly steering the narrative around bitcoin and the rest of crypto, by trying, for instance, to introduce bitcoin and ether (ETH) ETFs in an attempt to open up crypto investing to a broader group of people. Such financial heavyweights are accustomed to doing business on a highly regulated exchange like CME, as opposed to Binance, which has run into trouble with U.S. regulators."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nThink this year\u2019s S&P 500 rally of 15 per cent is pretty good? Take a look bitcoin\u2019s price, which has more than doubled since January.\n\nYet even that has done little to lift the fortunes of Robinhood. The company, whose app allows users to trade a number of cryptocurrencies, has lost four-fifths of its value since hitting a high in 2021. The stock fell another 15 per cent on Wednesday.\n\nThird-quarter earnings underscore how the app is losing its cachet among young traders.\n\nRobinhood\u2019s funded accounts grew by 360,000 year-on-year to 23.3mn. But fewer customers are actively trading. The number of monthly active users fell 16 per cent to just over 10mn compared with the period for the prior year. That is about half the figure reached at the height of the retail trading frenzy two years ago.\n\nThe company\u2019s woes are not shared by all its rivals. Brokerage platform Charles Schwab added 665,000 active accounts during its third quarter. Morgan Stanley, which owns E*Trade, added about 300,000 accounts during the September quarter.\n\nOverall, Robinhood\u2019s transaction-based revenue fell 11 per cent to $185mn during the quarter, amid a sharp drop in crypto and equities trading. It now makes more from its customers\u2019 idle cash. Segregated client accounts hold about $3.5bn of cash and securities. Revenue from net interest income nearly doubled year-on-year to $251mn. Even so, it booked a net loss of $85mn.\n\nThe boost from net interest income should soon diminish. The Federal Reserve appears to have finished raising interest rates. That will make for tougher comparatives in future. This is reflected in Robinhood\u2019s lowly valuation of less than four times revenue. Charles Schwab manages five times.\n\nRobinhood has sought to reinvent itself by branching out into new products such as retirement accounts. But to do so it will compete against established brands like Charles Schwab and Fidelity. It needs to find more arrows in its quiver to draw in more active traders."

Source: CNBC\n\nBitcoin\u2019s most recent price surge has been attributed to the potential approval of 12 separate spot Bitcoin ETFs over the next week. According to Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a window until Nov. 17 to approve a number of high-profile offerings from prominent U.S. fund managers.\n\nWhile there is much fanfare over the potential approval of these highly-anticipated BTC products, both analysts have also noted that there could be a lag time of a month or more before these offerings actually launch.\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale, the largest cryptocurrency asset manager in the U.S., has also reportedly engaged the SEC directly to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to a spot Bitcoin ETF. The U.S. is yet to see a spot Bitcoin ETF approved, which would allow investors to gain indirect exposure to a financial product that is physically backed by BTC.\n\nMagazine: The Truth Behind Cuba\u2019s Bitcoin Revolution: An on-the-ground report"

After a somewhat dull summer, Ordinals activity is back and already nearing the highs seen in May. Notably, yesterday public Ordinals trading volume in the preceding 24 hours surpassed Ethereum NFT\u2019s for the first time.\n\nRare BTC specializes in the sale of rare satoshis and Sub-100 Ordinals, considered to be highly sought after in the digital collectibles space. This recent transaction follows a previous successful brokerage by Rare BTC, where inscription number 20 was sold for 3 BTC.\n\nThe company\u2019s role in the Ordinals market includes connecting collectors, artists, and independent brokers to facilitate transactions. BTC Inc.'s established network within the Bitcoin community and its reputation for reliability play a crucial part in completing these sales, particularly as it offers escrow services to ensure secure exchanges between buyers and sellers.\n\nThose interested in acquiring or selling prime Ordinal inscriptions, or seeking brokerage partnerships, can reach out to Rare BTC through their email at rare@b.tc or DM on Twitter (X). Further information about their services and offerings can be accessed on their website.\n\nBitcoin Magazine was a pioneer in the Ordinals space, having inscribed its own historic print magazine covers into the bitcoin blockchain among the first 100,000 inscriptions.

        "title": "Best Cryptocurrency Stocks for 2024 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have quickly become a hot investment that is gaining mainstream adoption. Markets for digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC -3.71%) were virtually unheard of in 2012, but it has since grown into a massive industry.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool\n\nThe cryptocurrency sector reached a peak market value of $3 trillion in fall 2021. The sudden surge in value and rapid evolution created immense wealth for early crypto investors. As a result, there is huge interest in finding and investing in the next cryptocurrency unicorn. With more than 20,000 different cryptocurrencies on the market -- and the world having been pushed further into the digital realm by the COVID-19 pandemic -- investing in technologies linking the digital blockchain space with society could be even more lucrative than guessing which token will become the next Bitcoin or Ethereum (ETH -3.52%). And there is no shortage of innovative companies trying to bridge the gap between the two.\n\nDigital currency companies hold major potential The original idea behind blockchain technology -- a digital ledger that automatically tracks transactions between parties and confirms ownership of a crypto asset -- was to create a borderless, peer-to-peer electronic cash payment system that's efficient and secure. Investors can certainly purchase cryptos themselves, perhaps by buying small amounts of several different cryptocurrencies. But a better way to gain exposure to the sector is to invest in bigger and more established companies that benefit from the increased popularity of blockchain and crypto assets. The revenue that crypto service providers are deriving from blockchain tech has explosively grown over the past few years. Companies that adopt blockchain technology, especially in finance, may gain a considerable edge over traditional competitors in processing payments. And brokers offering digital assets may attract more customers than exchanges offering traditional assets such as stocks and bonds. However, the sector is subject to sharp market swings. Its peak value of $3 trillion slipped to less than $1 trillion in June 2022 as rising inflation drove many investors away from high-risk investments. This was not the crypto market's first gigantic plunge, and it probably won't be the last. Every investment is subject to risks, and you should only invest money you don't need in the short term. That guidance is even more important in the highly volatile crypto sector. In keeping with that guidance, here are some of the best cryptocurrency stocks to consider:\n\n1. Coinbase Global Coinbase Global (COIN -8.6%), a top cryptocurrency trading exchange, made its initial public offering (IPO) in April 2021. The company is a popular platform for purchasing major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano (ADA -0.93%), allowing users to trade more than 250 altcoins. The Coinbase platform\u2019s success has been contingent on the increase in crypto prices, which in turn has led to millions of new users creating accounts. Coinbase earns a small transaction fee whenever someone buys or sells a cryptocurrency. But the company aspires to be more than just a place to trade. It also sponsors a debit card that allows consumers to spend from the balance in their digital wallet, and it\u2019s launched a cloud platform for companies using and storing digital currencies. Coinbase offers two game-changing innovations. The first is bringing the practice of asset loans -- which were previously only available to affluent investors -- to the masses. Users can pledge their Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as collateral and receive a low-interest loan to cover expenses. Using crypto as collateral means investors don\u2019t have to sell their assets when emergencies arise, allowing their principal to continue compounding while they deal with matters at hand. The second innovation is the rising adoption of Coinbase\u2019s blockchain analytics by governments and financial institutions. Because most blockchains operate on a public ledger, the company can harness and monitor the data for illicit transactions and wallet addresses. Suppose hackers managed to break through an individual's computer and demand ransom in the form of Bitcoin to unlock the machine. In that case, Coinbase could then match the hacker's wallet address with millions of know-your-customer (KYC) data points stored on its platform. This could help law enforcement track down the flow of funds and apprehend the cybercriminals -- building greater trust in the crypto space.\n\n[Cryptocurrency] is a new asset class, but like real estate, there's only so much Earth. So it's defined, and therefore this moving price of the commodity is just how much, within this finite class of a commodity, this new asset class, how much people value it or want it. David Gardner, co-founder, The Motley Fool\n\n2. Block and PayPal Holdings At the heart of every digital payment protocol is the absence of central intermediaries (and therefore, lower costs for businesses and consumers). So Block (SQ -4.98%) (formerly Square) and PayPal (PYPL 2.05%) saw a meaningful business opportunity in enabling users to purchase and hold cryptocurrencies within a digital wallet. In late 2017, Block\u2019s Cash App consumer-facing application began allowing Bitcoin trading. In 2020 and 2021, Bitcoin was a huge revenue generator for Block, although the trading feature did little to help the company\u2019s bottom line. However, the company is helping to foster the use of Bitcoin among its business users (through the Block ecosystem), and it could become a top platform for crypto transactions between companies and their customers. This is especially promising for disrupting traditional international transactions in which banks often charge hefty foreign exchange fees. Cash App added support for the Bitcoin Lightning network in April 2022, allowing customers to transfer Bitcoin much faster and without transaction fees. CEO Jack Dorsey said the feature will \u201cincrease the usability of Bitcoin all toward an open global monetary transmission network the world can trust.\u201d PayPal\u2019s Venmo digital wallet and peer-to-peer payments app, which unlocked crypto trading in early 2021, offer a similar mix of simple banking features and mass-market crypto-trading tools. At the launch, Venmo supported the trading of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH -0.46%), Ethereum, and Litecoin (LTC -2.56%). With the most users of any peer-to-peer money movement app, Venmo could become a leading cryptocurrency platform with its new feature. It serves as a solid access point for investors who wish to buy major cryptocurrencies and then use them to purchase altcoins or access decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. 3. Canaan and Hut 8 Mining Bitcoin mining has changed dramatically over the past few years. These days, companies such as Canaan (CAN -6.57%) design high-powered, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) machines specifically for the purpose of brute-force guessing the network's correct hash (passcode). Canaan's next-generation Avalon ASICs can make tens of trillions of guesses every second for the right hash to validate blocks on the Bitcoin network, which is millions of times more powerful than AMD (AMD -1.79%) and Nvidia's (NVDA -4.45%) latest graphics processing units (GPUs) for this hyper-specific purpose. Sales have been skyrocketing due to the device's affordability and relatively low energy consumption, meaning greater profits for miners. One of the most popular Bitcoin mining stocks is Hut 8 Mining (NASDAQ:HUT). The company, based in Canada, commands a sizable minority stake on the overall Bitcoin network, and it generates very strong cash flows compared to revenue. Instead of selling the Bitcoin it mines on the market, Hut 8 Mining maximizes returns for shareholders by lending them out and farming yields, leading to compounded returns. Furthermore, investors can be assured that environmental concerns regarding the practice won't hold the company back. Hut 8 Mining uses a mix of wind, solar, and natural gas sources for its electricity, with decade-long leases.\n\n4. Nvidia and AMD Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD don\u2019t deal with cryptocurrencies directly, but the two semiconductor companies are the leading designers of graphics processing units (GPUs). Best known for powering high-end video game graphics, GPUs now enable computing-intensive applications such as data centers, artificial intelligence, and the creation of crypto assets. Cryptography and blockchain creation require immense computational power, and GPUs are well-suited for the job. Back in 2018, booming cryptocurrency prices were a driving force for Nvidia and AMD stock price increases as digital currency miners (people using their computers to create new units of digital assets) scrambled to purchase GPUs for the task. GPUs remain a fundamental piece of hardware for creating and managing crypto assets. Nvidia even launched a new lineup of chips specifically for crypto mining in early 2021. Both Nvidia and AMD look to further cement their positions as leaders in chip technology through acquisitions. Nvidia recently tried to purchase ARM Holdings, which licenses chip architecture design for data centers and smartphones, and AMD wanted to acquire field-programmable chip leader Xilinx. Nvidia had to give up on its ARM deal, but AMD completed its Xilinx buyout in February 2022. With or without the acquisitions, Nvidia and AMD are poised to continue taking market share of the semiconductor industry and are leading the way in developing more emerging technologies such as blockchain ledgers. 5. Meta Platforms and Shopify Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META -0.2%) attempted to develop a new cryptocurrency called Diem (formerly Libra). Diem was envisioned as a global financial payment and infrastructure platform accessible to everyone, including almost one-third of the global population without bank accounts. The project had some setbacks, including losing Visa (V 0.43%), Mastercard (MA 0.76%), and PayPal from its consortium of high-profile members. Government regulators expressed skepticism about Diem since cryptocurrency is still largely unregulated, and Meta eventually sold its control of Diem for $200 million. Nevertheless, work on the project is continuing under the new ownership, and Meta is reportedly considering different options for entering the cryptocurrency market. The company certainly wants to control part of the blockchain infrastructure behind its ambitious Metaverse vision. E-commerce infrastructure and software provider Shopify (SHOP -0.86%) allows merchants using its platform to accept cryptocurrencies as payment. It recently deepened its capability by integrating with cryptocurrency payments processor CoinPayments. In the spring of 2020, Meta\u2019s Facebook Shops was announced as a new offering for small business e-commerce, with Shopify as a third-party software provider powering the new online stores. Together, Meta and Shopify are primed to benefit if the adoption of digital assets continues among small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\n6. Robinhood Markets Robinhood Markets (HOOD 6.85%) is a popular discount brokerage app that allows users to buy stocks, options, rare metals, and now, cryptocurrencies. Investors can buy and sell more than a dozen cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin (DOGE 2.53%), commission-free on the platform 24/7. The company already holds billions of dollars in crypto assets under custody, with crypto trading revenue now comprising a significant portion of overall sales. Robinhood can combine its commission-free model with scaling the number of cryptocurrencies on the platform, gaining a massive competitive advantage over both traditional and decentralized exchanges. The company also could offer the same crypto analytics services as Coinbase to further promote trust in the sector and boost its adoption. 7. CME Group CME Group (CME -0.52%) operates the world\u2019s largest financial derivatives exchange allowing investors to trade futures, which bet on the future price of an asset, and options, which grant investors the option to sell or buy an asset in the future at a predetermined price. CME Group's exchange trades a diverse assortment of assets, including agricultural and mining products, energy, stocks, and currencies. It\u2019s the latter that makes CME Group a crypto stock. At the end of 2017, CME established the first market for Bitcoin futures. At the start of 2020, the company created a market for options on Bitcoin futures. As of March 2022, Ether (units of the crypto platform Ethereum) also had futures available on the exchange. Both Ether and Bitcoin futures were joined by micro futures this year, based on smaller slices of the underlying cryptocurrencies. Establishing a full-featured exchange for derivatives of the best-known cryptocurrencies has given Bitcoin and Ethereum some extra legitimacy and provided a way for digital currency owners (both individuals and a growing list of businesses that accept cryptocurrencies as payment) to mitigate risk from changes in cryptocurrency prices. Cryptocurrency derivatives are still a small market for CME Group, but adding more exchanges for crypto assets in the future is possible -- and even likely.\n\nRelated crypto topics\n\nThe beauty of crypto stocks The best part about cryptocurrency stocks is that most of them are not pure plays on the industry, giving investors the reward of ample diversification. Cryptocurrencies are quite volatile and can cause wild swings in the revenue and earnings of companies with sector exposure. The crypto realm is rapidly gaining mainstream adoption. In August 2021, United Wholesale Mortgage (UWMC -1.3%), the second-largest mortgage lender in the U.S., announced it would accept Bitcoin to settle mortgage payments from its customers. Expect further momentum in crypto stocks as more companies join in the blockchain revolution. At the same time, you need to keep an eye on the evolving regulatory framework while the crypto market adapts to the ever-changing global economy. The stocks mentioned above are smart investments in digital currencies, and most of them come with the benefit of also running significant business operations outside the crypto sector. As such, many investors find that they make more sense than buying the cryptocurrencies themselves, at least until regulators and governments around the world have nailed down their long-term approach to digital assets."

        "content": "China to protect NFTs\n\nIn a surprise move, the Chinese government has guaranteed legal protection for NFTs.\n\nIn response to a series of often conflicting judicial opinions on the state of cryptocurrency in the country, the Chinese government has officially issued a legal commentary on dealing with cases of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) theft and their status as virtual property protected by law.\n\nAccording to a Nov. 9 publication by China\u2019s state-controlled Southwest University of Political Science and Law (SUPL), digital collectibles such as NFTs \u2014 unlike ordinary online images \u2014 conform to the characteristics of online virtual property due to their non-tamperable features, unique codes and detailed transaction information.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis highlights the scarcity of digital collections, which have both use value and exchange value,\u201d jurists write. \u201cAccording to Article 127 of the Civil Code, it can be seen that from the perspective of civil law, online virtual property is regarded as an object of rights that \u2018is different from property rights, creditor\u2019s rights, intellectual property rights, etc. and is protected by civil law\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn addition, jurists state that the theft of NFTs, therefore, carries applicable criminal penalties, which can be evaluated in conjunction with related offenses committed during the course of the theft, such as hacking into computer systems or data theft.\n\n\n\n\u201cDigital collections have technical characteristics that cannot be copied, indicating that the holder has exclusive control. If the digital collection is stolen by others, the holder loses exclusive control,\u201d jurists from SUPL say.\n\n\u201cAlthough our country has not yet opened the secondary circulation market for NFTs, consumers can rely on the trading platform to complete operations such as purchase, collection, transfer, and destruction, and achieve exclusive possession, use, and disposal rights.\u201d\n\nChina has seen a rise in civil disputes this year involving cryptocurrencies, with some courts ruling that virtual assets are protected by law and others saying they are not. Last month, Chinese government-owned newspaper China Daily announced a 2.813 million Chinese yuan ($390,000) grant for third-party contractors to design an NFT platform. In May, Chinese prosecutors announced they would crack down on \u201cpseudo-innovations\u201d within its NFT market.\n\nA Chinese judge explains that according to current laws, parties in a crypto lending contract are not entitled to judicial protection.\n\nBitget\u2019s to invest in India\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Bitget will invest $10 million over five years in startups primarily based in India.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 7 announcement, startups will have the opportunity to pitch to Bitget and venture capitalists including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, and Draper Labs, during the BUIDL for Web3 multichain summit in India.\n\n\n\n\u201cBitget aims to identify valuable and promising projects in the crypto space and provide them with comprehensive support, accelerating innovation in emerging technologies,\u201d the exchange says. To qualify, projects must have a minimum viable product and hold multiple layers of security functionalities with auditing transparency.\n\nGracy Chen, Bitget\u2019s managing director, says that India is \u201cthe most wanted place to invest in Asia,\u201d citing its constant advancements in blockchain and overall entrepreneurial spirit. The exchange\u2019s previous investments in Indian Web3 startups include AI-based script generator Grease Pencil, AI resume generator HAIr, and AI dermatological app Derma360.\n\nLinekong\u2019s $15M Bitcoin Fund\n\nLinekong Interactive, a Chinese tech firm listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HKEX), will kickstart a $15 million fund dedicated to revitalizing the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem.\n\nAccording to founder Wang Feng, the new fund is dubbed \u201cBTC Next\u201d and will accelerate novel projects developing asset issuance, exchanges, virtual machines, NFTs and GameFi protocols on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\n\n\u201cBTC NEXT will participate in the research and investment of Bitcoin network ecological assets as early as possible, publish crypto investment portfolios regularly, and update the list of Bitcoin ecological crypto assets participating in investment,\u201d Wang writes.\n\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem has expanded greatly this year with the invention of Ordinals and Inscriptions, two novel data storage methods that, together, allow users to mint unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. The market cap of Bitcoin tokens minted on the BRC-20 standard, mirrored after the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, has surpassed $1.4 billion since inception.\n\nLinekong was founded in Beijing in 2007 with a focus on video games and cinema. In 2018, Wang Feng resigned as CEO of Linekong to focus on blockchain, founding several projects in the nonfungible tokens, decentralized finance, and Bitcoin mining space.

        "title": "Crypto Is Back: Buy These 2 Cryptos and 1 Stock Right Now - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "With Bitcoin (BTC -3.88%) soaring by more than 110% this year, and with many other cryptocurrencies following close behind, the growing consensus appears to be that the long \"crypto winter\" that kept a lid on prices may finally be over. In mid-October, for example, Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley (MS -0.48%) suggested that \"crypto spring\" could soon be on its way.\n\nThis profound change in market sentiment could open the door for huge gains for select cryptocurrencies, as well as for a handful of stocks highly leveraged to the crypto industry. With that in mind, I've picked out two cryptos and one stock that could be potential accumulation targets as we head into 2024.\n\nBitcoin\n\nThe obvious pick here is Bitcoin. This was the one cryptocurrency mentioned by Morgan Stanley's wealth management team, and the one that has been getting a lot of attention from institutional investors throughout the year. A major catalyst will be the launch of the first-ever spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for the U.S. market, now scheduled for the first quarter of 2024. This product launch could lead to a tsunami of new money flowing into Bitcoin. As much as 10% of all Bitcoin circulating in the world could soon be held by spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAnd there's a second, potentially even bigger factor: The upcoming Bitcoin halving, now scheduled for April 2024. As Morgan Stanley points out, this halving event (in which the mining reward for Bitcoin miners is cut by one-half) will be the big kick-off event for \"crypto spring.\" In three previous halving cycles, Bitcoin has rallied strongly to new highs, and the expectation is that the same phenomenon may occur next year as well. Investment firm Bernstein, for example, recently put out a $150,000 price target for Bitcoin.\n\nSolana\n\nIf you're looking to diversify your exposure away from Bitcoin, my top pick is Solana (SOL 4.09%), which is already up a head-spinning 317% this year. And that might just be the start. Analysts are rushing to put out even higher price targets for Solana. One valuation model calls for Solana to skyrocket from its current level of $40 to $500 or even $1,000.\n\nIt's easy to dismiss Solana as just a trendy momentum play. However, I think there is a compelling narrative around Solana, which has the potential to displace Ethereum (ETH -3.66%) as the top Layer 1 blockchain. On that basis alone, the market cap disparity between Solana ($17 billion) and Ethereum ($225 billion) should start to narrow. Put another way, is Ethereum really 13 times more valuable than Solana?\n\nFor nearly two years, we've been hearing about Solana as a potential \"Ethereum killer,\" and this process may finally be happening. There have been some big wins for Solana thus far in 2023. In April, Solana launched the first-ever crypto phone (known as the Saga) as part of its new mobile crypto strategy. Then, in early September, Solana signed a partnership agreement with Visa on a major payment project. If it continues with more big wins in 2024, then things could be very sunny indeed for Solana.\n\nCoinbase\n\nFinally, there's Coinbase (COIN -8.58%), which is a play on a broad-based crypto recovery. The basic narrative here is that \"crypto spring\" will bring retail investors back to crypto trading. It will pump up the number of daily active users on the Coinbase platform, and it will boost overall trading volume.\n\nRight now, approximately 20% of all trading that takes place on Coinbase involves Bitcoin, so any market rally for Bitcoin could have huge follow-on effects for Coinbase. At the same time, Coinbase is moving ahead with new projects, such as the recent launch of its Base blockchain, to keep ahead of competitors in the area of decentralized finance.\n\nRisk factors\n\nWhile there is reason to hope for the return of the next big crypto bull market rally, it is far from guaranteed. Several things could go wrong. The SEC, for example, might decide to drag its feet on the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Or the Bitcoin halving might end up over-promising and under-delivering. After all, past performance is no guarantee of future performance, and there's no ironclad law that says Bitcoin must rally with every halving.\n\nBy investing in cryptos or stocks with solid, long-term prospects, and by diversifying as much as possible, you can help to reduce (but not eliminate) the inherent risk and volatility involved with investing in crypto. For me, Bitcoin, Solana, and Coinbase offer the optimal mix of risk and reward, and are intriguing investment targets heading into 2024."

Discover SCENE\n\nEarn a free on-chain NFT by taking our free course, Crypto Investing: Fundamentals First. Decrypt will cover gas fees for the first 10,000 mints!\n\nOrdinals are taking Bitcoin by storm. Ordinal Inscriptions, similar to NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin (BTC). Inscribing on satoshis, named after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, is possible thanks to the Taproot upgrade launched on the Bitcoin network on November 14, 2021.\n\nWhat is an Ordinal Inscription?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin developers have worked to bring non-fungible tokens or NFTs to the number one blockchain for nearly a decade, beginning in 2014 with Counterparty, the creators of the Rare Pepe NFT collection, followed by Stacks in 2017. The Inscription process writes or inscribes the data of the content stored into the witness of the Bitcoin transaction. The witness was introduced in the SegWit upgrade to the Bitcoin network in 2017.\n\n\u201cWhat the team came up with Ordinals is genius,\u201d Alex Miller, CEO of Hiro, a developer for layer-2 smart contract platform Stacks, told Decrypt in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s super core to the Bitcoin ethos in that they basically took several different things and pieced them together in a way the original creators did not foresee or expect.\u201d\n\nThe first step in the creation of Ordinals is users downloading Bitcoin Core and syncing the node to the blockchain. After the sync is completed, the next step is to create an Ordinals wallet and send some satoshis to the wallet.\n\nHow did we get to this point?\n\nLaunched in 2017, Segregated Witness or SegWit fixed a host of bugs in Bitcoin Core, allowing more transactions per block, and laid the groundwork for Layer 2 payment channels like the Bitcoin Lightning Network. SegWit caused heated debate in the Bitcoin community and led to a hardfork of the network resulting in the launch of rival blockchains, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Satoshi\u2019s Vision, also known as Bitcoin SV.\n\nWhile detractors may view Ordinals as abusing the network, Ordinals developer Casey Rodarmor says these claims are unfounded.\n\nWith Taproot, all parties in a transaction can cooperate to make these complex transactions look like standard, person-to-person transactions. They do so by combining their public keys to create a new public key and combining their signatures to create a new signature. It does this through a device called Schnorr signatures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Taproot upgrade also scrambles transactions with single and multiple signatures, making it more challenging to identify transaction inputs on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. Taproot enhances privacy while reducing the amount of data needed to make them, lowering transaction costs that have become much higher as Bitcoin has become more popular.\n\n\u201cOne thing that people don\u2019t understand is that in order for Bitcoin to be secure, blocks must be full. That is part of the coin security model,\u201d Rodarmor told Decrypt in an interview. \u201cIf blocks are not full, then nobody has any reason to pay more than the minimum fee rate to have their transactions included in a block. So, as a result, blocks must be full.\u201d\n\nOrdinals can be a complicated process due to the size of the Bitcoin blockchain and the need to use the Command Line (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Ordinals?\n\nThe race is on to develop more seamless methods of inscribing on Bitcoin and wallets that make it possible to view the Bitcoin NFT once it is created.\n\nLooking to create a seamless way for collectors to create Ordinal Inscriptions, Gamma, a Bitcoin NFT marketplace on Stacks, began offering a paid service that allows users to inscribe images and text. Other projects providing this service include Oridalsbot from the creators of the Satoshibles NFT collection.\n\nSo you want a Bitcoin ordinal?

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nStarting tomorrow, there\u2019ll be a small window during which the Securities and Exchange Commission could approve 12 pending Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nThat approval could include the BlackRock iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF and the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, according to Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas.\n\nTheir rationale: When the SEC gave itself a deadline extension for pending ETF applications, it chose Wednesday, Nov. 8 as the last day for rebuttal comments. It\u2019s also possible that the SEC could approve several between now and Nov. 17, but require all the funds to begin trading on the same day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDelay orders were issued by the SEC for BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity & Valkyrie at the same time,\u201d Seyffart wrote on Twitter. \u201cIf the agency wants to allow all 12 filers to launch\u2014as we believe\u2014this is the first available window since Grayscale's court victory was affirmed.\u201d\n\nDelay orders were issued by the SEC for BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity & Valkyrie at the same time.

Instead, they could buy shares that would be backed by Bitcoin that\u2019s been bought by the issuer.\n\nSeyffart pointed out another caveat: Even if the SEC approves a rule change that would allow an ETF to trade, that\u2019s totally separate from approving a fund\u2019s registration statement. Both filings would need to be approved before any of the pending Bitcoin ETFs could begin trading.\n\nWhat Scott said: There are TWO paths that need to be completed for an ETF launch. Even if 19b-4 is approved, S-1s still need sign off from division of Corp Fin. No sign that's done yet. Possible and even likely that there could be weeks or even months between approval & launch https://t.co/LZSdutmlT8 pic.twitter.com/7OLj5HjSDy \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 8, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven if it could be months before a Bitcoin ETF is trading, the recent price rally proves investors are optimistic about it. BTC gained over 20% in October, buoyed by the optimism that the long-awaited approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF might finally materialize\u200b.\n\nEarlier today, a person familiar with Grayscale\u2019s efforts to convert GBTC to a Bitcoin ETF told Coindesk that the firm\u2019s been actively discussing its application with the SEC.\n\nBut a potential spot Bitcoin ETF isn\u2019t just about making the BTC price go to the moon.\n\nAnalysts have suggested that a spot Bitcoin ETF could attract between $50 billion to $100 billion in inflows over the next five years, which could cause a significant shift in the asset's market dynamics\u200b. That could be good and bad news for Bitcoiners, some of whom told Decrypt they\u2019d be happy for Wall Street titans not to sit on big piles of their favorite asset.\n\nIn the past six weeks alone, crypto funds have attracted $767 million worth of deposits, according to crypto asset manager CoinShares.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA bot that\u2019s designed to stifle the creation of new BRC-20s re-emerged on the Bitcoin blockchain. Its pseudonymous creator, @rot13maxi on Twitter, told Decrypt that he didn\u2019t do it. But he did share the code with someone else yesterday.\n\nDubbed the Sophon, the bot looks for incoming Bitcoin transactions that involve Ordinals and \u201csnipes\u201d certain ones before they can become fully processed. Paying a fee to effectively jump the line in Bitcoin\u2019s queue, the bot foils fresh BRC-20s by frontrunning their ticker names.\n\n\u201cI think that there is a copy of the Sophon out there running, and it's not me, which is great,\u201d @rot13maxi said, adding that he is \u201cgoing back and forth\u201d on sharing the bot\u2019s code publicly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLaunched earlier this year, Ordinals is a protocol that allows for the creation of NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by \u201cinscribing\u201d it onto individual satoshis, which are equal to 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin. That data has so far included art, profile pictures, and text.\n\nPioneered by the pseudonymous on-chain data analyst Domo in March, BRC-20s are fungible tokens on Bitcoin realized through Ordinals.\n\nBRC-20s are created using text-based inscriptions, which comprise JSON code. \u200b\u200bAmid surging interest in BRC-20 tokens in May, Bitcoin transaction fees skyrocketed to multi-year highs as hundreds of thousands of text-based Ordinals inscriptions flooded Bitcoin\u2019s mempool daily.\n\nShort for memory pool, Bitcoin\u2019s mempool is a backlog of transactions waiting to be verified by miners and added to the Bitcoin network's next block. In addition to Bitcoin\u2019s block rewards, miners receive transaction fees tied to each transaction. If a user inputs a higher fee, miners are incentivized to act quickly.\n\nHow the Sophon Works\n\nThe Sophon snuffs out new BRC-20s using this mechanic, @rot13maxi said. For a BRC-20 to exist, it needs to be deployed first using a text-based inscription. The bot seeks out these transactions, copies the token\u2019s ticker name, and stops a BRC-20 dead in its tracks by paying a higher fee and setting its total supply to one\u2014all in a fraction of a second.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was kind of a proof of concept to demonstrate this design flaw,\u201d @rot13maxi said of the Sophon. \u201cIf you want to have a global namespace\u2014that's first come first serve [...]\u2014then you have to account for the fact that anybody can see that you're in the mempool, and anybody can come and take [a token\u2019s name] from you.\u201d\n\nThe Sophon was activated on October 3, and text-based inscriptions plummeted 72% to 13,700 from 49,000 the day before, according to a popular Dune dashboard. And a day after the bot\u2019s funds were depleted on October 23, text-based inscriptions jumped 540% to 74,300 from 11,500.\n\nIn total, @rot13maxi said the Sophon derailed the deployment of around 275 fledgling BRC-20s, with a 75% success rate. He said he spent about 0.013 Bitcoin ($500 in today\u2019s prices) to keep the bot running for a few weeks in October.\n\n\u201cWhen it ran out of money, I just decided I'm not going to keep pumping money into this if nobody cares,\u201d @rot13maxi said. \u201cSo, I turned it off. And now everybody is clamoring for it back.\u201d\n\nYes! But we need sophon back @rot13maxi \u2014 raph (@raphjaph) November 6, 2023\n\nOf the people on Twitter calling for the Sophon\u2019s return on Monday was @raphjaph, Ordinals\u2019 pseudonymous lead maintainer, who took over the day-to-day oversight of the protocol in May after its creator, Casey Rodarmor, signaled he was taking a step back from the project.\n\nWhile the figures may sound small, a single transaction deploying a BRC-20 can result in thousands upon thousands more, as speculators rush to snatch up its predetermined supply, Charlie Spears of Bitcoin mining firm Luxor Technologies told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the primary driver of BRC-20 volume [...], the vast majority of BRC-20 events are mint functions,\u201d Spears said, estimating that 80% to 90% of BRC-20 transactions are people claiming created tokens, or \u201cjust minting and speculating on the price.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs of this writing, Spears said about 20 BRC-20s had been deployed with a supply of one over the past day, suggesting that some form of the Sophon came back online on Wednesday.\n\nMonsters in the Mempool\n\nSci-fi fans may already be familiar with the name Sophon. @rot13maxi\u2019s bot is named after an antagonistic supercomputer in Remembrance of Earth's Past, a three-part series by Chinese writer Liu Cixin. It's likely best-known for its first novel, \"The Three-Body Problem,\" which is set to debut as a televsion series on Netflix in 2024. In the tale, an alien civilization releases the Sophon on Earth, crippling its scientific progress using its small size.\n\n\u201cThe Sophon was this little supercomputer that was the size of a proton, that would fly in front of particle accelerators and block them\u201d in Cixin\u2019s books, @rot13maxi said. \u201cSo my bot flies in front of the BRC-20 deployments and blocks them.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Sophon is not infallible, he noted. Someone trying to create a BRC-20 could always skate by unscathed by paying a higher fee, @rot13maxi said. Or, they could also ask the Sophon\u2019s operator to turn it off\u2014part of his reasoning for considering a public release.\n\n\u201cI feel like that's not really keeping with the spirit of this thing,\u201d @rot13maxi said of keeping the bot in the hands of a few. \u201cYou have to assume that there are monsters lurking in the mempool that will come and eat your protocol if they're vulnerable.\u201d"

        "content": "Linekong Interactive, a gaming and film production company headquartered in Beijing and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HKEX), is allocating $15 million to invest in projects building on the Bitcoin network.\n\nWang Fang, the founder of Linekong, said in a Nov. 8 tweet that the fund, dubbed \u201cBTC Next,\u201d will be used to accelerate emerging projects in the Bitcoin ecosystem, including \u201casset issuance protocols, trading markets, expansion, virtual machines, NFT, RWA, and GameFi.\u201d\n\nFor initial efforts, the firm would \u201cparticipate in the research and investment of Bitcoin network ecological assets as early as possible,\u201d publish its investment portfolios, and update the list of Bitcoin ecological crypto assets. \u201cThe panoramic curtain of the Bitcoin network ecology has slowly unfolded,\u201d BTC Next wrote. Traditionally, Bitcoin lacked the programmability associated with newer blockchains such as Ethereum, remaining for most periods largely unchanged from its invention in 2008.\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin ecosystem has expanded greatly this year with the invention of Ordinals and Inscriptions, two novel data storage methods that, together, allow users to mint unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn June, cross-chain wallet BitKeep (now Bitget Wallet) added deposit and withdrawal support for BRC-20 Bitcoin tokens modeled on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard. On Nov. 7, Binance listed popular BRC-20 token Ordinals (ORDI), causing its value to surge more than 40% in a single day. BRC-20 tokens have altogether reached $1.36 billion in market capitalization since their inception.\n\nFounded in 2007 in Beijing as an online gaming firm, Linekong Interactive first went public in Hong Kong in 2014. Before founding Linekong, Wang was a vice president of software development at Kingsoft Software, a Chinese information technology conglomerate.\n\nWang resigned as CEO of Linekong in 2018 to focus on blockchain, founding several projects in the nonfungible tokens, decentralized finance, and Bitcoin mining space. He returned to Linekong as CEO in 2022 after an invitation from the firm\u2019s board of directors to better integrate Linekong products with Web3.\n\nRelated: Swiss crypto bank SEBA gets Hong Kong SFC license"

        "title": "The History of the Mt Gox Hack: Bitcoin's Biggest Heist - Blockonomi",
        "content": "At the beginning of 2014, Mt Gox, a bitcoin exchange based in Japan, was the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, handling over 70% of all bitcoin transactions worldwide. By the end of February of that year, it was bankrupt.\n\nAnyone who was using Mt. Gox lost access to their assets, and it has been a cautionary tale for crypto investors. While the assets weren\u2019t all lost, anything that was left has been frozen for years.\n\nNow, it looks like things might be turning a corner, but there are still many unknowns. Before we talk about how there could be a resolution on the horizon, let\u2019s look at how we got here in the first place.\n\nThe victim of a massive hack, Mt. Gox lost about 740,000 bitcoins (6% of all bitcoin in existence at the time), valued at the equivalent of \u20ac460 million at the time and over $3 billion at October 2017 prices. An additional $27 million was missing from the company\u2019s bank accounts. Although 200,000 bitcoins were eventually recovered, the remaining 650,000 have never been recovered.\n\nThis post will discuss the rise and fall of Mt. Gox, the aftermath of the hack and the resulting (and ongoing) investigation and will consider whether it could happen again.\n\nFor a long time it looked like the creditors of Mt. Gox could be left empty handed, but there have been some new developments that may mean a return of capital to crypto traders who were left holding the bag when Mt. Gox went bust.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nMt. Gox was the largest bitcoin exchange handling 70% of transactions in early 2014\n\nIt was hacked in 2014 resulting in the loss of 740,000 bitcoins worth $3B+\n\nOnly 200,000 bitcoins have been recovered leaving 650,000 still missing\n\nMt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in 2014\n\nInvestigations found the exchange was hacked as early as 2011\n\nThe hack drained the hot wallets and cold storage\n\nCEO Mark Karpeles was arrested in 2015 but has pleaded not guilty\n\nA new civil rehabilitation process began in 2019 to repay creditors\n\nThe repayment deadline has been extended to Oct 31, 2024\n\nThe Rise of the Mt Gox Exchange\n\nLaunched in 2010 by US programmer Jed McCaleb (who later went on to found Ripple), Mt Gox expanded rapidly to become by far the most popular bitcoin exchange in the world after being purchased by French developer and bitcoin enthusiast Mark Karpel\u00e9s in March 2011. Rather bizarrely the name Mt Gox stood for \u201cMagic: The Gathering Online eXchange\u201d.\n\nIn June 2011 the Mt. Gox exchange was hacked, most likely as a result of a compromised computer belonging to an auditor of the company. On that occasion, the hacker used their access to the exchange to artificially alter the nominal value of bitcoin to one cent and then transfer an estimated 2,000 bitcoins from customer accounts on the exchange, which were then sold.\n\nIn addition, an estimated 650 bitcoins were purchased from the exchange at the artificially low price by Mt. Gox customers, none of which were ever returned. As a result of this hack Mt. Gox took a number of security measures, including arranging for a substantial amount of its bitcoin to be taken offline and held in cold storage.\n\nIn spite of the June 2011 hack, by 2013 Mt. Gox had established itself as the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, in part as a result of increased interest in bitcoin as the price of the coins increased rapidly (jumping from $13 dollars in January 2013 to a peak of more than $1,200).\n\nHowever, behind the scenes all was not well.\n\nThe Struggles behind the scenes\n\nAlthough Mt. Gox had quickly expanded to become the largest bitcoin exchange in the world by 2013, behind the scenes it was struggling.\n\nSince its collapse, a number of Mt. Gox employees have spoken about how Mt. Gox was operating, with a picture being painted of a disorganized and discordant organization, with poor security procedures, serious issues relating to the source code of the website and a number of serious issues arising in relation to the operation of the business.\n\nIn May 2013, a former business partner of Mt. Gox called Coinlab sued the company for $75 million, claiming breach of contract. The two companies had signed an agreement under which Coinlab would take over Mt. Gox\u2019s American customers but, according to Coinlab\u2019s lawsuit, the deal failed to materialize due to Mt. Gox breaching a clause of the contract.\n\nIn addition, the US Department of Homeland Security was investigating claims that a subsidiary of Mt. Gox operating in the US was not licensed and was therefore operating as an unregistered money transmitter. As a result of this investigation, more than $5 million was seized by the US government from the company\u2019s bank accounts.\n\nAs a result of the US investigation, Mt. Gox had announced a temporarily suspension of withdrawals in US dollars. Although this suspension only nominally lasted for one month, many customers were experiencing delays of up to 3 months in withdrawing cash from their accounts and few US dollar withdrawals were being successfully completed.\n\nAll these delays resulted in Mt. Gox losing its place as the largest bitcoin exchange in the world by the end of 2013, falling to third.\n\nHowever, as it turned out, these issues were the tip of the iceberg. Underneath the hood, Mt. Gox had much bigger problems than it realized. It had been the victim of an ongoing hacking for over two years.\n\nThe Mt. Gox hack\n\nOn 7 February 2014, Mt. Gox stopped all bitcoin withdrawals, claiming that it was merely pausing withdrawal requests \u201cto obtain a clear technical view of the currency process.\u201d\n\nAfter a number of weeks of uncertainty, on 24 February 2014, the exchange suspended all trading and the website went offline.\n\nThat same week, a leaked corporate document claimed that hackers had raided that Mt. Gox exchange and stole 744,408 bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox customers, as well as an additional 100,000 bitcoins belonging to the company, resulting in the exchange being declared to be insolvent.\n\nOn 28 February Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan, and in the US two weeks later.\n\nSubsequent investigations have shown that the massive hack of Mt. Gox had begun as early as September 2011.\n\nAs a result of all this, Mt. Gox was operating while technically insolvent for almost two years and had practically lost all of its bitcoins by mid-2013. Additional evidence has suggested that Mt. Gox was already missing up to 80,000 bitcoins from its exchange even before Mark Karpel\u00e9s purchased the exchange in 2011.\n\nAlthough it remains an ongoing investigation and the facts remain unclear at this time, it is presumed that most of the bitcoins that were stolen from Mt. Gox were taken from its online (or hot) wallets, including all of the currency being held in cold storage, due to a \u201cleak\u201d in the hot wallet.\n\nAn online cryptocurrency wallet is a web-based wallet used to store secure digital codes, known as private keys that show ownership of a public digital code, known as a public key, that can be used to access the currency addresses and it is this information that is stored in a wallet.\n\nPrior to September 2011, the Mt. Gox private key was unencrypted and it would appear that it was stolen via a copied wallet.dat file, either by hacking or perhaps through an insider.\n\nOnce the file was hacked, the hacker(s) were able to access and cipher bitcoins gradually from the wallets associated with Mt. Gox\u2019s private keys without the hack being detected.\n\nThe shared keypool of the copied file led to address re-use, which meant that the company appeared to be oblivious to the theft, with the Mt. Gox systems interpreting the transfers as deposits apparently being moved to more secure addresses.\n\nWhenever the wallets emptied, the Mt Gox system\u2019s interpretation of the theft as deposits resulted in an additional 40,000 extra bitcoins being credited to multiple user accounts.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nIn March 2014, Mt. Gox reported on its website that it had found 200,000 bitcoins in old-format digital wallets that had been used by the exchange prior to June 2011. These bitcoins remain held on trust for creditors while the company remains under bankruptcy protection.\n\nMark Karpel\u00e9s was arrested in Japan in August 2015 and charged with fraud and embezzlement, although none of these charges directly relate to the theft. He was imprisoned until July 2016, when he was released on bail.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his trial is ongoing.\n\nMt. Gox remains under bankruptcy protection, with the case still being under investigation. In addition, the litigation with CoinLab remains outstanding and distribution to creditors cannot occur until that lawsuit is settled.\n\nWhere did the money go?\n\n650,000 bitcoins remain unaccounted for as a result of the Mt. Gox hack. A number of online theories have been developed as to where the missing coins are.\n\nSome have suggested that Mt. Gox never had the amount of coins that it claimed, and that Karpel\u00e9s had manipulated the numbers to make it appear that Mt. Gox held more bitcoin than it in fact held.\n\nIn respect of how the hacker was able to access the bitcoins that Mt. Gox held in cold storage, the theories range from suggestions that the storage may have been compromised by an individual with on-site access to suggestions that the cold storage coins were gradually deposited into the Mt. Gox exchange system when a hot wallet ran low, and that a lack of accountability among staff simply meant that there was no awareness that the wallets were being drained by hackers.\n\nIn July 2017, a Russian national named Alexander Vinnik was arrested by US authorities in Greece and charged with playing a key role in the laundering of bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox. In additional Vinnick was charged by Greek authorities for laundering of approximately $4 billion in bitcoin.\n\nVinnick is alleged to be associated with BTC-e, a well-established bitcoin exchange, which was raided by the FBI as part of the investigation.\n\nThe BTC-e site has been shut down and the domain & web hosting accounts seized by the FBI, the first time the US government has seized a foreign exchange on foreign soil.\n\nInvestigations by Wizsec, a group of bitcoin security specialists, had identified Vinnik as the owner of the wallets into which the stolen bitcoins had been transferred, many of which were sold on BTC-e.\n\nWith the trial of Mark Karpel\u00e9s ongoing in Japan and the indictment against Vinnik, it would appear that the separate strands of the investigation into the Mt. Gox hack are finally coming together.\n\nWhether any of this will result in the recovery of all or any of the stolen bitcoins remains to be seen, but it does appear that we will have at least some clarity into the Mt. Gox hack in the near future.\n\n\u201cGoxRising\u201d-A New Path Forward\n\nIn February of 2019, TechCrunch reported that a movement called GoxRising was working to pursue an alternative to bankruptcy for Mt. Gox.\n\nThe idea behind GoxRising is simple: instead of use the bankruptcy courts to hand over Mt. Gox\u2019s assets to the owners of the company, it is using civil rehabilitation law to return the most it can to the creditors of the company.\n\nIt would appear that GoxRising has been successful in its efforts, as Tokyo lawyer Nobuaki Kobayashi has been appointed by Japanese courts to handle the civil rehabilitation process. This is good news for anyone who lost their assets in the Mt. Gox failure, as they will likely gain much more as a result of civil rehabilitation.\n\nThere is also another potential upside for Mark Karpeles, the embattled CEO of Mt. Gox.\n\nIf the bankruptcy process had continued to move forward, it is likely that Karpeles would\u2019ve ended up with a lot of Mt. Gox\u2019s assets. He owned around 80% of the company when it went bust, putting him in pole position for a massive payout under Japanese bankruptcy law.\n\nKarpeles knows that if he ended up with most of the Mt. Gox stash, his life would be in limbo. First, he would face a barrage of civil suits from Mt. Gox creditors who had lost everything to him. Bitcoin prices are much higher today than they were in 2014, which would just add insult to injury.\n\nAlso, jilted investors may not be satisfied with simply suing Karpeles. People have been killed for far, far less than what Karpeles would have done, if he ended up walking away with a massive pile of Bitcoins after everyone who trusted him got burned.\n\nNeedless to say, the civil rehabilitation process seems like a winning idea for everyone involved, and it looks like it is moving forward. Kobayashi was put into his position earlier this year, and the civil rehabilitation is expected to take 3-5 years, according to reports in the media.\n\nCivil rehabilitation is still a time-consuming process, but it does look a lot better than bankruptcy!\n\nLessons Learned\n\nThe pivot to civil rehabilitation is emblematic of how much different the crypto world is from the established financial system. Bankruptcy law was a terrible framework to address the failure of Mt. Gox, and would\u2019ve created an unjust situation that may have led to massive amounts if litigation, and potentially illegal acts.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that Karpeles was actually planning to defraud people who were using Mt. Gox, and his life has been rough since the exchange went belly-up. He has faced multiple lawsuits already, can\u2019t leave Japan, and also did some jail time before getting released into the land of the rising sun on a limited basis.\n\nNot a lot of fun for anyone!\n\nNow, it looks like there is a way forward that would get Karpeles out of his unenviable situation, and make sure anyone whose assets assets were frozen in 2014 got them back.\n\nThe clear lesson to the crypto community is that there need to be better structures in place for when the worst happens, as it is absurd that people are still waiting to gain access to their property.\n\nThe Centralized Crypto Exchange Dilemma\n\nCrypto assets lend themselves to decentralized networks. Despite that, the exchanges that offer the best prices and deepest liquidity are almost universally centralized. While the centralized nature of the exchanges isn\u2019t inherently an issue, the fact they they act as custodians isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nOnce an entity takes ownership over an asset, the potential for a Mt. Gox-esque scenario exists. Given the kind of laws that govern bankruptcy in the established financial system, the way cryptos are traded does appear to be less-than-perfect.\n\nThere are decentralized exchanges that offer a wide range of trading services, but they are unlikely to be able to match centralized crypto exchanges, especially when it comes to inter-exchange interface.\n\nThe ability to trade directly with other centralized crypto exchanges is a big advantage, and it is difficult to see how that could happen without custodianship.\n\nA Horror Story for Institutional Investors\n\nCustodial issues are one of the biggest issues for institutional investors when it comes to cryptos. Far from being paranoid speculation, the Mt. Gox situation gives any money manager who is being pressured to invest in cryptos a terrible example that could scare anyone out of the sector.\n\nThe idea that a hack could turn an entire exchange illiquid and keep any of the traders from accessing their assets isn\u2019t going to win cryptos many proponents in the investment banking community. If cryptos are going to grow, the \u2018Custodial Question\u2019 has to be addressed.\n\nUnfortunately, the crypt world grew out of boot-strapped platforms and business structures that were never intended to appeal to the world of high-finance. Now that more people are interested in cryptos, these sub-par systems are holding back the industry in a big way.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how professional a trading interface looks, the back office is what really matters when it comes to attracting the big money. If chain-of-custody and ownership can\u2019t be established quickly, and by an outside auditor, nothing else really matters.\n\nCould it happen again?\n\nThe short answer is that yes, it could.\n\nThere are many bitcoin exchanges operating at present, some of which are more reputable than others. Popular exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance are relatively transparent about their operations, as well as offering insured deposits, and are backed by reputable venture capitalists.\n\nHowever, they are also going to be the targets of the best hackers, who will be only too happy to exploit any security gaps.\n\nDecentralized exchanges generally don\u2019t act as a custodian for you assets, which means Mt. Gox couldn\u2019t happen to you.\n\nIn addition, there are many smaller exchanges currently trading that aren\u2019t as clear about how they operate. That does not mean that such exchanges are operating a hack or disreputable in any way.\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrency trading, it is recommended that you use the more reputable exchanges, if only for your own peace of mind, unless you have the means to absolutely guarantee the legitimacy of any smaller exchange that you are dealing with.\n\nAnd if the above isn\u2019t enough to scare you, my one last word of advice would be to make sure that you don\u2019t store your bitcoins on any exchange. See our post on cryptocurrency wallets for more details on how to store your bitcoins.\n\nMT Gox Update 2023\n\nAs of 2023, The long-running Mt. Gox saga continues, as trustees for the hacked cryptocurrency exchange have announced a deadline extension for repaying creditors. Originally ordered to finish distributions by October 31, 2023, the trustee now has until October 31, 2024 to complete the repayment process.\n\nThis marks the second major deadline extension, as creditors have waited nearly a decade to recoup losses from the infamous 2014 hack.\n\nWhile around 200,000 of those coins have since been recovered, creditors are still owed around 650,000 BTC from the hack. With bitcoin\u2019s value exponentially higher now compared to 2014, that stolen sum is worth close to $23 billion today.\n\nThe Tokyo-based trustee managing distributions cites technical and administrative delays as reasons for pushing the deadline back another full year. This includes time spent hunting for more of the missing bitcoin and organizing the process for evaluating creditor claims.\n\nThe repayment is slated to proceed in both BTC and fiat currency at creditor\u2019s request. Analysts expect the release of tens of thousands of bitcoins may impact prices to some degree, though markets are much more liquid today.\n\nFor Mt. Gox victims, the deadline extension provides closure on any hopes of receiving funds in 2023. But it also promises progress by finally making creditors whole after years of waiting.\n\nWe will update as the story progresses."

Other major digital assets, including ether (ETH), have also seen positive gains, with ETH up 20 percent in the last month.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nDespite the impressive performance of bitcoin this year, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise Asset Management, believes that the widely expected approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is not yet priced in.\n\nHe explains that potential ETF buyers are not aware that it is coming or expect it to be approved until 2025 or later. Therefore, if these buyers do not anticipate its approval in the next two months, it cannot be considered priced in.\n\nHougan emphasises the significant role that ETFs will play in expanding cryptocurrency investments to a broader range of investors, particularly financial advisors who manage a substantial portion of the U.S.' wealth. Currently, only 20 percent of self-directed retail investors have bought crypto, while 80 percent of America's wealth is controlled by financial advisors and institutions who require an ETF to access crypto.\n\nHe compares the potential impact of a bitcoin ETF to the launch of gold ETFs in the early 2000s, which led to a prolonged period of gold price increases. Hougan suggests that BlackRock's filing for a spot bitcoin ETF in June had a significant psychological impact on the market, dispelling the negative sentiment caused by the FTX collapse.\n\nAlso read: Bankman-Fried's trial exposed crypto fraud but Congress has not been eager to regulate the industry\n\nMoreover, coincidentally, an anonymous source recently revealed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is engaged in with Grayscale Investments.

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Surge As Dozen BTC ETFs Have 'Brief Window' For SEC Approval: Analyst Predict - Benzinga",
        "content": "Major cryptocurrencies experienced a significant surge on Wednesday evening amid anticipation surrounding the upcoming decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Starting tomorrow, a limited time frame will emerge, within which the approval of 12 pending Bitcoin ETF applications could potentially take place.\n\nCryptocurrency Gains +/- Price (Recorded 9:30 p.m. EST) Bitcoin BTC/USD +1.51% $35,929 Ethereum ETH/USD +0.66% $1,909 Dogecoin DOGE/USD +3.07% $0.076\n\nWhat Happened: The BlackRock iShares Spot Bitcoin ETF and the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust could potentially receive approval, as suggested by Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas.\n\nTheir reasoning stems from the fact that when the SEC granted an extension for pending ETF applications, it designated Wednesday, Nov. 8 as the cutoff date for rebuttal comments. It is also possible that the SEC might approve multiple funds before Nov. 17, but mandate that all of them commence trading on the same day.\n\n\"Delay orders were issued by the SEC for BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity & Valkyrie at the same time,\" Seyffart wrote on X. \"If the agency wants to allow all 12 filers to launch\u2014as we believe\u2014this is the first available window since Grayscale\u2019s court victory was affirmed.\"\n\nMeet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga\u2019s exclusive event \u2013 Future of Digital Assets.

The index added 0.1% to reach a closing level of 4,382.78, matching the eight-day winning run it achieved in November 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite closed slightly higher, climbing by 0.08% to settle at 13,650.41. This marked the index\u2019s ninth consecutive positive day, also its longest winning streak in two years.\n\nIn addition to these market movements, investors are eagerly anticipating forthcoming statements from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the IMF on Thursday.\n\nSee More: Best Cryptocurrency Scanners\n\nAnalyst Notes: Michael Van de Poppe believes that Bitcoin is currently maintaining a strong upward trend, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. He anticipates that the next target for Bitcoin is around $37-38K. \"If that happens, buy the dip.\"\n\nPseudonymous crypto analyst TradingShot has made a bold prediction on the TradingView website, suggesting that the price of Bitcoin could potentially reach a staggering $200,000. This analysis centers around the Bitcoin Vortex bullish cross and the Bollinger Bands Width (BBW) bottoms, indicators used to determine when BTC may embark on its next parabolic rally.\n\nThe analyst\u2019s forecast is based on the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, scheduled to occur in Q2 2024. According to the analyst, this event marks the beginning of the final and most aggressive phase of the Bull Cycle\u2019s Parabolic Rally sequence.\n\nSantiment, the on-chain data analytics firm, has reported that Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable surge of +37% in just 2 months. This surge has resulted in a significant increase in the ratio of traders opening bullish positions compared to bearish positions, reaching its highest level in the past 3 months. Furthermore, the total open interest on exchanges has skyrocketed to an impressive $7.2 billion. With hopes that the fear of missing out (FOMO) will subside, it is anticipated that Bitcoin will continue its upward trajectory.\n\nCrypto Photo by Fernando Cortes on Shutterstock\n\n\n\nJoin Benzinga\u2019s Fintech Deal Day & Awards on Nov. 13 and Future of Digital Assets on Nov. 14 in New York City to stay updated on trends like AI, regulations, SEC actions and institutional adoption in the crypto space.
