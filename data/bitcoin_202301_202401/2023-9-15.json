        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 best blockchain and bitcoin ETFs. If you want to skip our discussion on the blockchain industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, there are over 1.8 million cryptocurrencies in the world, with a market capitalization of $1.04 trillion as of September 2023. The market cap of cryptocurrencies reached an all-time high of $2.9 trillion in November 2021. Currently, there are 670 cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide where digital currencies are actively traded. Cryptocurrencies primarily rely upon blockchain technology to record transactions in a decentralized and secure manner. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most dominant cryptocurrencies in the world, accounting for over 67% of the global cryptocurrency market capitalization. Both of these cryptocurrencies heavily depend on blockchain technology, which enables consensus, security, and the decentralized distribution of these digital assets. Notably, blockchain technology's application extends beyond cryptocurrency and finds utility in various sectors, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and identity verification. Popular companies like PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) also have exposure to the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.\n\nThe Impact of Rising Interest Rates on Bitcoin\n\nIn the last year, the US Federal Reserve has increased the benchmark interest rates on seven occasions from 3.125% to 5.375% at midpoint. The most recent interest rate hike took place on July 27, and the Federal Reserve continues to express the possibility of further rate increases as a measure to control inflation, aiming to achieve its 2% target. The US consumer price index (CPI) for the month of July 2023 was recorded at 3.2%, and analysts anticipate the CPI to increase to 3.6% for August 2023. The CPI reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, following which the Federal Reserve accelerated the pace of interest rate hikes. It is widely believed that rising interest rates are likely to hurt Bitcoin prices. However, recent market dynamics have contradicted this viewpoint. In the last year, despite the significant interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks globally, the price of Bitcoin has observed a surge of 18.5%. Bitcoin emerged as one of the best-performing asset classes as it outperformed the 12.2% increase observed by the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Furthermore, Bitcoin even outperformed gold prices, which are traditionally considered a safe-haven asset during periods of rising inflation. Gold experienced a more modest increase of 15.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nEvolving Crypto Investment Landscape\n\nFollowing the debut of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:BITO) in October 2021, numerous Blockchain and Bitcoin funds have entered the market. Global X, a New York-based ETF provider, has been particularly active in this space, introducing three ETFs related to blockchain, with the Global X Blockchain ETF (NASDAQ:BKCH) being one of its most recognized products. Numerous retail investors have expressed interest in identifying the best crypto ETF offered by Vanguard, a prominent investment advisor based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, with an asset under management (AUM) of $7.7 trillion. While Vanguard does not offer a dedicated ETF exclusively focused on Blockchain and Bitcoin, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) serves as one of the largest and most widely recognized Bitcoin investment funds, with a market value of $3.28 billion. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is an investment trust that charges an annual fee of 2% to cover insurance, management, and storage expenses. It holds actual Bitcoins on behalf of investors. Each share represents a fractional ownership interest in the trust's Bitcoin holdings. The investment fund enables investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without having to directly hold or manage Bitcoins. It must be noted that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust trades over-the-counter (OTC) as an unregistered security, so it can only be purchased through brokers.

For ETFs with a shorter history, we have looked at their performance since inception. While some of these ETFs have generated negative returns over the past 5 years, they have posted strong positive YTD returns, indicating their potential to offer healthy returns for investors in the future. These ETFs provide exposure to the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors through various approaches, such as investing in Bitcoin futures or in companies with a strong connection to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.\n\nBest Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs\n\n10. VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (CBOE:XBTF)\n\n5-Year Price Performance: -58.2%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $41.95 million\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.76%\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (CBOE:XBTF) invests in Bitcoin futures contracts and aims to provide exposure to Bitcoin price movements without needing to own the cryptocurrency. The ETF invests primarily in Bitcoin futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) using a passive, index-tracking strategy. It does not invest in Bitcoin directly or hold it, unlike the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (OTC:GBTC). Although the ETF has been in the red over the last 5 years, it has yielded a YTD return of 51.84% as of September 14.\n\n9. AdvisorShares Managed Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:CRYP)\n\nPrice Performance since Inception: -35.8%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $402,060\n\nExpense Ratio: 1.59%\n\nAdvisorShares Managed Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:CRYP) is an actively managed ETF that invests in Bitcoin futures contracts and money market funds. Like VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (CBOE:XBTF), the ETF does not invest directly in Bitcoin but provides exposure to Bitcoin price movements through futures. The ETF is managed by AdvisorShares Investments, which is a thematic ETF issuer. As an active ETF, the manager can shift holdings, attempting to optimize returns rather than passively tracking an index. Due to its active management approach and specialized nature, the fund has a high expense ratio. The ETF has generated a YTD return of 29.25% as of September 14.\n\n8. Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF (NASDAQ:FDIG)\n\nPrice Performance since Inception: -24.0%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $43.04 million\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.39%\n\nFidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF (NASDAQ:FDIG) is an actively managed ETF that invests in companies engaged in cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and digital payments. The four biggest holdings of the ETF are Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA), Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) and CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK). Together, these four stocks have a combined weightage of over 43.2%. As an active ETF, Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF (NASDAQ:FDIG) can shift allocations seeking to optimize exposure to the crypto/blockchain segment. The ETF does not invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies directly; instead, it focuses on equities. The ETF's YTD return stands at 66.17% as of September 14.\n\n7. Siren NASDAQ NexGen Economy ETF (NASDAQ:BLCN)\n\n5-Year Price Performance: -12.5%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $68.74 million\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.68%\n\nSiren NASDAQ NexGen Economy ETF (NASDAQ:BLCN) invests in companies focused on blockchain, Bitcoin, and quantum computing technologies. It is at the seventh place on our list of the 10 best blockchain and bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe ETF\u2019s holdings include cryptocurrency miners, exchanges, and service providers, as well as quantum computing and semiconductor companies. The ETF tracks the Indxx Blockchain Index, which contains companies involved in the nascent blockchain economy and provides exposure to emerging blockchain and cryptocurrency companies. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd, and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) are the top four holdings of the ETF, representing 19% of the portfolio.\n\nHere's what Wedgewood Partners said about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was the leading detractor from performance during the quarter. Total payment volume grew +12% (foreign exchange neutral) while revenues grew +10% (FX-neutral) and adjusted operating earnings grew +19%. E-commerce industry sales trends have normalized back to their pre-pandemic trend of growth, with high-margin branded payments keeping track with the industry. Despite this, investors were concerned PayPal\u2019s fast growing, private label payments solutions will dilute Company returns. However, payments are a very scalable business, and we expect the Company will be able to manage both private label and branded to achieve attractive returns and double-digit growth. Although multiples in the payment industry have compressed, especially after the multi-year process of being added to the financial sector, PayPal\u2019s businesses are substantially different enough from traditional spread-based businesses, in addition to having much more compelling growth drivers, that PayPal\u2019s well-below market multiple should revert to its higher, historical average.\u201d\n\n6. ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW)\n\n5-Year Price Performance: 1.7%\n\nTotal Net Assets as of September 14, 2023: $1.37 billion\n\nExpense Ratio: 0.88%\n\nARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW) is the oldest and the biggest ETF on our list of the best blockchain and bitcoin ETFs in terms of net assets.\n\nThe actively managed ETF is focused on companies expected to benefit from next-gen internet technologies, including blockchain and cryptocurrency. ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW) is managed by Cathie Wood-led ARK Investment Management. The St. Petersburg, Florida-based asset management firm is known for identifying and investing in disruptive technologies. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) are two notable top holdings of the fund, representing over 14.8% of the ETF's portfolio.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Blockchain and Bitcoin ETFs.

        "content": "On the latest episode of Macro Markets, analyst Marcel Pechman examines the current state of the American economy. He references a headline from Barron\u2019s that highlights the disparity between people\u2019s perception of the economy and the objective data.\n\nPechman delves into the concept of excess savings, agreeing with Barron\u2019s that a significant portion of the United States population lacks sufficient savings for retirement, potentially necessitating longer working years. He notes that household wealth in the U.S. has reached new heights, primarily due to surges in equities and real estate assets.\n\nShifting his focus, Pechman discusses rising concerns among U.S. consumers about increasing prices, particularly the cost of filling up their vehicles with gasoline. He connects this to the recent surge in U.S. crude futures, influenced by Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to extend output curbs.\n\nPechman foresees challenges for President Joe Biden, especially in managing inflation and the impact of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes on real estate and the S&P 500. He then addresses the implications for Bitcoin (BTC), suggesting that if inflation outpaces income growth, it could exert downward pressure on the cryptocurrency.\n\nMoving on to the U.S. budget issue, Pechman explores the possibility of a government shutdown due to disagreements in Congress. In a critical analysis, Pechman questions the use of disaster funds to cover war expenses, drawing attention to the Biden administration\u2019s priorities. He emphasizes the potential consequences and legality of such maneuvers.\n\nPechman concludes by suggesting that a U.S. government shutdown could trigger a bull run in Bitcoin and advises keeping an eye on this potential trigger for a cryptocurrency rally in early October.\n\nCheck out the latest episode of Macro Markets, available exclusively on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel."

        "title": "Forget About a Bitcoin ETF, This Might Be the Real Catalyst Bitcoin Needs - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Over the past few months, much attention has been given to the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin (BTC -1.08%) exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Many investors and analysts believe such approval will be a catalyst for broader adoption of Bitcoin because it would allow institutional money managers to include the ETF in various investment vehicles, such as pension funds and 401(k)s.\n\nHowever, as the SEC stalls on its review of the multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications, another profound development recently occurred, and it could be more meaningful.\n\nA much-needed update\n\nOn Sept. 6, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) announced its intention to introduce new fair-value accounting rules explicitly tailored for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These rules, expected to be formally published by year-end and fully effective by 2025, signal a significant stride toward achieving much-needed clarity in cryptocurrency accounting.\n\nThe SEC has designated the FASB to set accounting standards for publicly traded companies, and the board's decision to implement new cryptocurrency accounting standards will eliminate much of the ambiguity that companies interested in holding cryptocurrencies previously had to navigate.\n\nThis development has yet to garner as much attention as the pending approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, yet the FASB's new guidelines could be just as transformative. Companies (private and public) will now be able to efficiently and accurately manage their digital assets, eliminating another barrier previously impeding adoption.\n\nBreaking down the new fair value accounting rules\n\nUnder the previous set of rules, Bitcoin was typically classified as an intangible asset. So if the market value of Bitcoin plummeted after the initial purchase, companies would need to recognize the losses in the form of impairment charges on their financial statements.\n\nThe problem with impairment charges is that they negatively affect reported income and threaten the overall health of a company's balance sheet. Making matters worse, if Bitcoin's price ascended, companies could only benefit from the appreciation if they sold their holdings, thereby losing the chance for long-term profits.\n\nWith the impending adoption of the new FASB rules, companies will no longer have to report unrealized crypto losses in the form of impairment charges on their profit-and-loss statement. Instead, they will now be able to disclose Bitcoin's true fair value on their balance sheets during quarterly financial reporting in the form of an unrealized loss, which is much more advantageous.\n\nFurthermore, these guidelines will allow companies to recognize unrealized gains as assets, a previously discouraged practice. By including unrealized gains in quarterly earnings, companies capture a tangible benefit that is discernible on balance sheets, allowing investors to gauge a company's financial health more accurately.\n\nA catalyst for corporate Bitcoin adoption\n\nAlthough the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs might democratize exposure to the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, the approval itself wouldn't contain any guidance on how a company should manage its crypto holdings. With revamped and more-straightforward rules, though, this will all change.\n\nWhen companies such as Tesla or MicroStrategy decided to add Bitcoin to their holdings years ago, they were plunging into uncharted waters. While they have navigated this uncertainty relatively well since then, the absence of a conducive accounting framework likely deterred many other companies when weighing the pros and cons of a Bitcoin strategy.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of crypto fair-value accounting standards by the FASB, companies are more likely to reconsider holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets since they can now benefit from unrealized appreciation and minimize negative effects on their income should prices slip.\n\nThe FASB plan alone should be celebrated as a victory, since it recognizes the growing corporate interest in Bitcoin and bolsters its legitimacy across the broader financial landscape. To the benefit of investors especially, these new rules lay a foundation for widespread adoption, and with Bitcoin's limited supply, this could lead to potential long-term price appreciation."

        "content": "Crypto Michael, a cryptocurrency analyst in the crypto space, has recently shared some insights on the possible market trend of the Bitcoin (BTC) price before the halving commences. These insights were shared in a video uploaded on the analyst\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nSigns Of A Potential Bull Run\n\nAccording to the recent revelations by Crypto Michael, Bitcoin might be on the brink of a new bull run. In his video, which has garnered over 2,000 views on YouTube, the analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency shows considerable resilience and potential for a surge.\n\nThis optimism stems from various indicators and patterns observed in Bitcoin\u2019s price action. It\u2019s not just Bitcoin\u2019s impending rise that Crypto Michael has highlighted.\n\nThe analyst also mentions that the altcoin market is warming up for a possible upward trend. The expert believes the significance of this parallel bullish movement for altcoins cannot be underestimated.\n\nIt is worth noting that a comprehensive bull market, including both Bitcoin and its altcoin counterparts, could mean significant gains for diversified crypto portfolios.\n\n$45,000 Ahead Of The Bitcoin Halving?\n\nDiving deeper into his analysis, Crypto Michael predicts a potential Bitcoin price of $45,000 before the much-anticipated halving event next year. A halving is crucial in the Bitcoin network, where miners\u2019 rewards for adding new blocks to the blockchain are cut in half.\n\nThis event typically decreases supply and can significantly influence Bitcoin\u2019s price. Historically, the crypto market has experienced bullish trends before and after halvings.\n\nThis cyclical behavior has been observed in the past two halvings, with price surges leading up to and following the event. However, the current market dynamics have left investors in a speculative state, pondering if history will repeat itself.\n\nParticularly, Bitcoin has shown a bearish trend over the past month, down by nearly 10%. The asset plunged from its high of $30,000 in late July to as low as trading just above $25,000 on Monday. However, Bitcoin\u2019s price can be seen to show signs of recovery in the past few weeks.\n\nThe asset trades above $26,000 at the time of writing, with a price of $26,338 and a market cap of $513 billion today. Notably, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is currently up by more than $10 billion compared to its recent market cap value of below $500 billion, seen earlier this month.\n\nIt is worth noting that while its market cap and price have surged over the past two weeks, the asset\u2019s trading has trended in the opposite direction. Particularly, Bitcoin\u2019s daily trading volume has plunged from the $18 billion seen earlier this month to as low as $10 billion, in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

The XRP token may see higher volatility in the coming weeks, but a broad decline in investor sentiment is unlikely.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the SEC\u2019s appeal didn\u2019t come as a surprise, investor confidence took a hit, with Bitcoin falling to a weekly low of US$25,060 on Monday, three days after the agency\u2019s legal action.\n\nTuesday brought positive developments for investors, after Standard Chartered\u2019s crypto custody arm, Zodia Custody, launched services in Singapore for financial institutions.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s move indicates growing institutional acceptance towards crypto, according to Manuel Ferrari, the co-founder of Money On Chain, the first Bitcoin-backed stablecoin protocol on Rootstock.\n\n\u201cThis move could potentially signal the start of a growing trend for more large institutions to enter the market. As one of the world\u2019s leading financial institutions, Standard Chartered\u2019s entry into the crypto space lends credibility and legitimacy to digital assets,\u201d wrote Ferrari, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nImage: Standard Chartered\n\nThe same day, Franklin Templeton, a holding company with US$1.52 trillion in assets under management, filed for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application. This only brought temporary relief for investors, considering that the SEC delayed the decision on several such ETF applications, including the ones from BlackRock and WisdomTree.\n\nTwo days after the news, Bitcoin recovered to US$26,529 on Thursday, which could pave the way to more upside momentum in September, according to Kadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing sentiment that Bitcoin could rally back above US$30,000 in the coming month,\u201d wrote Stadelmann.\n\nHowever, Ferrari expects Bitcoin\u2019s recovery to be short-lived.\n\n\u201cThe recent rebound in Bitcoin\u2019s price has set the stage for a temporary bounce in price, likely to the US$28,000 level. That will likely be short-lived, however, as Bitcoin is likely to experience further downward pressure in the coming months,\u201d wrote Ferrari.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, the release of the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) showed that inflation posted its biggest monthly increase this year, rising 0.6% for August and 3.7% from a year ago.\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nNotable movers: BCH, RUNE\n\nBitcoin Cash was this week\u2019s biggest gainer in the top 100, rising 13.23% to US$217.14. The token started picking up pace on Tuesday as the wider crypto investor sentiment was improved by the launch of Standard Chartered\u2019s crypto custody wing.\n\nRune, the native governance token of the ThorChain network, was this week\u2019s second-biggest gainer, rising 11.53% to US$1.75. The coin started picking up momentum on Wednesday and has been receiving increased investor interest since lending went live on the protocol on Aug. 21.\n\nSee related article: Grayscale wins against SEC as India moves on blockchain; Friend.tech loses friends\n\nNext Week: Can Bitcoin reclaim US$30,000 in September?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s double-bottom technical formation, which printed its first leg down on June 15 and the second one this week, is a bullish sign for the short term, according to Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App.\n\n\u201cWhile Bitcoin is likely to trade lower in the coming months, the double bottom signals a short-term bullish trend for Bitcoin. If Bitcoin manage to close the week above the resistance of approximately US$25,000, it signals strong short-term support,\u201d wrote Kiely, adding that Bitcoin could see considerable bullish momentum if it returned to US$30,000 in September.\n\nIn the macroeconomy, investors will be looking forward to the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest rate decision on Wednesday. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 97% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, up from 92% one week ago. It gives a 67.2% chance for another pause in November.\n\nSee related article:India\u2019s G20 Presidency, Blockchain Week & Singapore\u2019s new President"

        "title": "Can New Bitcoin BSC Coin Repeat the Bitcoin Price Move from $1 to $30,000 And Mint More Millionaires? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "NEW YORK, Sept. 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ \u2014 If you had bought $100 of Bitcoin in 2011, it would have been worth $3m when BTC was trading at $30,000 earlier this year \u2013 could Bitcoin BSC ($BTCBSC \u2013 bitcoinbsc.io) repeat that feat?\n\nCrypto investors certainly think so, which explains why the 'Bitcoin on BNB Smart Chain' staking crypto asset has raised more than $2 million in less than two weeks as its presale races toward the finish line of $3.96 million.\n\nBitcoin BSC could turn $100 into $1 million like the original Bitcoin, but it is selling fast \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can buy it now at the Bitcoin 2011 price of $0.99 (Bitcoin BSC)\n\nCurrently priced at just $0.99 in presale \u2013 roughly the price Bitcoin was at in 2011 \u2013 Bitcoin BSC has a much better risk-reward profile for potential investors than Bitcoin, not to mention the staking yield that generates an income stream to buttress capital returns.\n\nTo be sure not to miss out on the presale alpha opportunities and the listing, which could be next week, follow the project's X (formerly Twitter) account and join the Telegram group.\n\nBitcoin is in good shape \u2013 and Bitcoin BSC will be a top beneficiary\n\nBehind the headlines about 'crypto winter' which followed failing crypto banks and exchanges, Bitcoin is actually looking in pretty good shape, and so are the Bitcoin derivative and clone coins that seek to provide a value differential over the original offering.\n\nBitcoin BSC, like Bitcoin, has a total supply of 21 million tokens. However, unlike Bitcoin, it runs on a proof-of-stake network, the BNB Smart Chain, which is a cheaper and more efficient blockchain.\n\nThe latest Bitcoin alternative coin has something else going for it that Bitcoin doesn't \u2013 staking built in by design.\n\nIf you buy Bitcoin BSC today with BNB, you can start staking and earning yield. Token buyers have jumped at the chance to start locking in passive income. So over 1,000,000 $BTCBSC has been staked and is currently earning an annual percentage yield (APY) of 268%.\n\nThe current staked tokens amounts to almost half of the total number of sold $BTCBSC to date.\n\nOften when you see an APY in triple figures, it can ring alarm bells given the huge spread it represents over the current interest rate levels in the advanced economies, which are in single figures.\n\nStory continues\n\nEverything is transparent with Bitcoin BSC, which means you can keep tabs on how many token holders are staking by visiting the real-time Bitcoin BSC staking dashboard.\n\nIn addition, the project's smart contracts are audited, and a guarantee of locked liquidity has been provided by the team for when it is listed on the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX).\n\nBitcoin BSC staking is built on solid foundations and is open now\n\nWith $BTCBSC, there is no impenetrable and opaque algorithm-based financial engineering built on rickety foundations like Terra Luna. Instead, Bitcoin BSC has allocated 69% of token supply to be paid out in rewards to stakers.\n\nThe pre-mined $BTCBSC tokens are emitted at a rate of 0.25 $BTCBSC per block in a block production schedule that mimics Bitcoin by rolling time back to 2011.\n\n$BTCBSC rewards are paid out every 10 minutes in a similar fashion to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBitcoin BSC is part of a new wave of derivative clone coins into the bitcoin space, drawing on the version 2.0 theme but, in this case, also leveraging the utility of staking.\n\nThese staking-based bitcoin clone coins come to market with the added security of buyers knowing that they come with a sizeable portion of the token-holding community already committed to the project through their deposits into its staking smart contract.\n\nThis means when the token launches on decentralized exchanges, there will be far less selling pressure due to the yield-bearing presence of staking at the heart of its tokenomics.\n\nStaked coins have a seven-day withdrawal lock, after which tokens can be taken off stake at any time. Those who initiate stakes after $BTCBSC is listed will be able to stake their tokens regardless of whether they have bought with BNB or ETH. But if you wish to initiate staking while the presale is still in progress, then you must purchase with BNB.\n\nBitcoin BSC is not just another Bitcoin clone or meme coin 'version 2' imitator\n\nStaking makes offerings like Bitcoin BSC far superior to the utility-light meme coin version 2 clones such as Pepe 2.0, Dogecoin 2.0, Shiba Inu 2.0, or even the likes of Bitcoin 2.0, whose only resemblance to bitcoin was in the name of the token.\n\nThen there are coins such as HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu (HPOS10I) that uses the ticker BITCOIN on DEXs \u2013 although most centralized exchanges refuse to allow it to use it. It does not have a 21 million supply and is really a meme coin take on Bitcoin with zero utility.\n\nNevertheless, as a meme coin that has achieved a level of virality, HPOS10I has attracted substantial interest, providing an example of the power of 'bitcoin' brand name recognition. From launch to peak, HPOS10I has returned 66,000% for early investors, provided they sold at the top.\n\nBut Bitcoin BSC is looking to play at the more serious end of the spectrum, where coins such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV have attracted considerable attention as alternatives to Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, these assets are forks from the original blockchain and carry all the baggage and complications that come with that, such as maintaining and developing the protocol.\n\nStill, Bitcoin Cash was the earliest such fork if we exclude Litecoin, and although it is some way off its highs, it has nevertheless been able to outperform Bitcoin in recent weeks.\n\nBitcoin BSC could rise 7x or more after launch, as BTC20 did\n\nThen there's BTC20 coin which launched a little over a month ago and also compares favorably to Bitcoin. While bitcoin has slid, at one stage slipping under $25,000 earlier this week, BTC20 has not only stayed in the green, it has been earning yield for its stakers.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is down 7.3% in the past 30 days, BTC20 is up 14% on its list price of $1. Bitcoin Cash is up 4.5% in the past month, also outperforming Bitcoin.\n\nWe should also add that in the case of BTC20, shortly after listing, it reached an all-time high of $5.9 for a 6x return for presale investors.\n\nAlthough some of the comparative returns cited above may not feel particularly spectacular by crypto volatility standards, savvy investors who have been around the block will be aware of the improving fundamentals for Bitcoin and how clone coins with better risk-reward potential, like Bitcoin BSC, are likely to benefit in an outsized way.\n\nJoe Parys Crypto YouTube channel, with 300k-plus subscribers, is tipping $BTCBSC as one of five Bitcoin alternatives to see a price explosion.\n\nAnother crypto YouTube analyst has invested $840 into BTCBSC, attracted by the APY as well as the token price appreciation potential.\n\nBitcoin halving could send $BTCBSC price to the moon\n\nBitcoin block rewards are due for their four-yearly halving in April 2024, and if past performance is a guide, the coin is on the cusp of yet another bull run. Each previous halving cycle bull run has seen bitcoin hit higher highs.\n\nAligning with that view, Pantera Capital predicts that the next cycle will be no different. The crypto asset manager reckons bitcoin will retrace back to $36,000 by the end of this year and surge to around $147k in the next halving cycle.\n\nTrue to form, bitcoin derivative coins will be among the leading beneficiaries of the halving cycle bull run, likely to outpace many other altcoins.\n\nBitcoin BSC is in pole position to benefit from the mother of all bull runs\n\nInstitutions and savvy investors have started accumulating Bitcoin in readiness for the next bull run.\n\nAside from the halving, the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF and the flood of new money \u2013 retail and institutional \u2013 that will flow into the Bitcoin and broader crypto market as a result, means the next altcoin season threatens to be the mother of all melt ups.\n\nDo your own research, but it probably makes sense to get ready for the upturn by adding some low-cap sparkle to your portfolio.\n\nA relatively modest allocation now to Bitcoin BSC could turn into 5x or even 100x gains very quickly, and in the near future, as we go into the halving cycle, life-changing profits could be on the table.\n\nIf you think digital currencies like Bitcoin are the future but missed out the first time around, then Bitcoin BSC provides a rare opportunity to grab a slice of the action before the bulls start rampaging.\n\nYou can buy $BTCBSC today with BNB, ETH or USDT. The minimum purchase amount is $10. Buy with BNB if you want to start staking straightaway before the presale ends. Those who choose to buy with ETH can start staking as soon as the presale ends.\n\nMedia contact: pr@bitcoinbsc.io\n\nWebsite: bitcoinbsc.io\n\nSocial Channels: Twitter | Telegram Community\n\nCision\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/can-new-bitcoin-bsc-coin-repeat-the-bitcoin-price-move-from-1-to-30-000-and-mint-more-millionaires-301929396.html\n\nSOURCE Bitcoin BSC"

On Sept. 10, Paxos paid the six-figure fee to move $2,000, with the average network fee typically being around $2. The company later acknowledged the mistake, confirming the transfer came from its servers. Almost a day after Paxos\u2019 claims, the Bitcoin miner who received the funds went on X (formerly Twitter) to express frustrations after agreeing to refund the amount to Paxos. The funds were returned on Sept. 15.\n\nCourt approves sale of FTX digital assets\n\nA bankruptcy court has approved the sale of FTX digital assets in weekly batches through an investment adviser and under preestablished guidelines. The sale does not include Bitcoin, Ether and \u201ccertain insider-affiliated tokens,\u201d which can be sold through a separate decision by FTX after 10 days\u2019 notice.

Franklin Templeton has $1.5 trillion in assets under management and joins a long list of asset managers waiting for regulatory approval.

This week\u2019s departures included the exchange\u2019s CEO, Brian Shroder, alongside legal head Krishna Juvvadi and chief risk officer Sidney Majalya. The mass exit is believed to be tied to the ongoing U.S. investigation into Binance and Binance.US.

Ignatova remains at large. Greenwood, who is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Sweden, was sentenced in a court in New York. In a statement by the Justice Department, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams called OneCoin \u201cone of the largest fraud schemes ever perpetrated.\u201d The multilevel marketing and Ponzi scheme reaped $4 billion from 3.5 million victims, the statement said. Ignatova has not been seen since October 2017 and is on the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Ten Most Wanted List.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group responsible for $55M CoinEx hack\n\nThe attack on crypto exchange CoinEx, which drained at least $55 million, was carried out by the North Korean hacker group Lazarus, according to blockchain security firm SlowMist and pseudonymous on-chain investigator ZachXBT. The hacker group was identified after it inadvertently exposed its address, which was the same one used in the recent Stake and Optimism hacks. On Sept. 12, CoinEx saw large outflows of funds to an address without any prior history. Security experts immediately suspected that the exchange was breached, with initial estimates reaching approximately $27 million.\n\nAre DAOs overhyped and unworkable?

        "content": "This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s \u201cThe Withdrawal Issue\u201d. Click here to subscribe now.\n\nA PDF pamphlet of this article is available for download.\n\n\u201cThe reason that we are focused on financial institutions and payment processors is because they are the so-called bottlenecks, or choke-points, in the fraud committed by so many merchants that victimize consumers and launder their illegal proceeds,\u201d Bresnickat explained to the club. \u201cWe hope to close the access to the banking system that mass marketing fraudsters enjoy \u2014 effectively putting a choke hold on it\u2026\u201d\n\nThis concerted effort, later labeled \u201cOperation Choke Point\u201d, targeted a wide range of business categories, including ammunition sales, drug paraphernalia, payday loans, dating services, pornography, telemarketing, tobacco sales, and government grants. This broad application of financial exclusion ultimately prompted multiple lawsuits and federal investigations into the conduct of both the DOJ and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), as well as harsh criticism from all corners.\n\n\u201cThe clandestine Operation Choke Point had more in common with a purge of ideological foes than a regulatory enforcement action\u201d, wrote Frank Keating, a former governor of Oklahoma who served in the DOJ during the Reagan administration, in a 2018 editorial for The Hill. \u201cIt targeted wide swaths of businesses with little regard for whether legal businesses were swept up and harmed. In fact, that seemed to be the goal.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the Trump administration\u2019s DOJ wrote a letter to Congress indicating that Operation Choke Point was officially over. In 2018, the FDIC promised to limit its personnel\u2019s ability to \u201cterminate account relationships\u201d and to put \u201cadditional training\u201d into place for its examiners.\n\nBut in the years since the federal government so blatantly demonstrated its interest in dictating access to banking services and its power to do so deliberately with little or no consequences, many feel that little has changed.\n\nBank Runs, With Bias\n\nOn March 8, 2023, it was announced that the cryptocurrency-focused institution Silvergate Bank would be voluntarily liquidated by its holding company. The bank had been focused on serving cryptocurrency clients since 2013 when its CEO Alan Lane first invested in bitcoin. In 2022, it had acquired the technology behind Meta\u2019s failed stablecoin project, Diem, with hopes of launching its own dollar-backed token. As the cryptocurrency market declined in late 2022, marked by the collapse of one of its biggest clients in cryptocurrency exchange FTX, the bank\u2019s stock price plummeted. It likely did not help that at the same time, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Roger Marshall, and John Kennedy asked Silvergate to disclose details of its financial relationship with collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX.\n\nSoon after, on March 10, 2023, almost ten years to the day from Bresnickat\u2019s public detailing of Operation Choke Point, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was seized by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation and placed under FDIC receivership, marking what was then the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history.\n\nSince 2021, the bank had been increasing its long-term securities holdings but, as the market value of these assets deteriorated amid U.S. dollar inflation and Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, it was left with unrealized losses. Simultaneously, its customers, many of whom were prominent businesses within the cryptocurrency industry and were similarly strained by economic conditions, were withdrawing their money. On March 8, 2023, SVB announced that it had sold more than $21 billion worth of securities, borrowed another $15 billion, and was planning an emergency sale to raise yet another $2.25 billion. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this sparked a run on its remaining funds, totaling some $42 billion in withdrawals by March 9, 2023. On Sunday, March 12, state and federal authorities stepped in; customers of Signature Bank had withdrawn more than $10 billion.\n\nSince 2018, Signature Bank had maintained a focus on cryptocurrency businesses, with some 30% of its deposits coming from the sector by early 2023. Signature Bank had also accrued a large proportion of uninsured deposits, worth some $79.5 billion and constituting almost 90% of its total deposits. It was holding relatively little cash on hand \u2014 only about 5% of its total assets (compared to an industry average of 13%) \u2014 so it was poorly prepared for a run on crypto-friendly banks spurred by SVB\u2019s issues. On March 12, 2023, the New York State Department of Financial Services closed Signature Bank and placed it under FDIC receivership as it faced a mountain of withdrawal requests. At the time, this represented the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history.\n\nFollowing their seizures of SVB and Signature Bank, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC described the takeovers as \u201cdecisive actions to protect the U.S. economy by strengthening public confidence in our banking system\u201d. But others suggested the actions, particularly against Signature Bank, signified a blatant reemergence of the prejudice displayed during Operation Choke Point and connected to a larger effort to stymie cryptocurrency businesses.\n\n\u201cI think part of what happened was that regulators wanted to send a very strong anti-crypto message\u201d, Barney Frank, a Signature Bank Board member and former congressman who helped draft the seminal \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d to overhaul financial regulation following the Great Recession, told CNBC in March 2023. \u201cWe became the poster boy because there was no insolvency based on the fundamentals.\u201d\n\nFollowing an FDIC announcement that Flagstar Bank would assume all of Signature Bank\u2019s cash deposits except for those \u201crelated to the digital-asset banking businesses\u201d, the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal announced that Frank was right to call out this bias.\n\n\u201cThis confirms Mr. Frank\u2019s suspicions \u2014 and ours \u2014 that Signature\u2019s seizure was motivated by regulators\u2019 hostility toward crypto\u201d, the board wrote. \u201cThat means crypto companies will have to find another bank to safeguard their deposits. Many say that government warnings to banks about doing business with crypto customers is making that hard.\u201d\n\nTargeting A New Choke Point\n\nPublic officials, financial professionals, and Bitcoin advocates had been pointing out an apparent bias against cryptocurrency businesses from the Biden administration well before the March 2023 bank runs. There were numerous policy events in the early part of 2023 to back up those sentiments.\n\nA January 3, 2023, \u201cJoint Statement on Crypto-Asset Risks to Banking Organizations\u201d from the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) noted that, \u201cThe events of the past year have been marked by significant volatility and the exposure of vulnerabilities in the crypto-asset sector. These events highlight a number of key risks associated with crypto-assets and crypto-asset sector participants that banking organizations should be aware of\u2026\u201d, effectively serving to dissuade financial institutions from taking on those risks.\n\nA White House \u201cRoadmap to Mitigate Cryptocurrencies\u2019 Risks\u201d released on January 27, 2023, indicated that the Biden administration sees the proliferation of cryptocurrencies as a threat to the country\u2019s financial system and warned against the prospect of granting cryptocurrencies more access to mainstream financial products.\n\n\u201cAs an administration, our focus is on continuing to ensure that cryptocurrencies cannot undermine financial stability, to protect investors, and to hold bad actors accountable\u201d, per the roadmap. \u201cLegislation should not greenlight mainstream institutions, like pension funds, to dive headlong into cryptocurrency markets\u2026 It would be a grave mistake to enact legislation that reverses course and deepens the ties between cryptocurrencies and the broader financial system.\u201d\n\nOn February 7, 2023, the Federal Reserve pushed a rule to the Federal Register clarifying that the institution would \u201cpresumptively prohibit\u201d state member banks from holding crypto assets as principal in any amount and that \u201cissuing tokens on open, public, and/or decentralized networks, or similar systems is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices\u201d.\n\nAnd on May 2, 2023, the Biden administration proposed a Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax, suggested as a way to force cryptocurrency mining operations to financially compensate the government for the \u201ceconomic and environmental costs\u201d of their practices with a 30% tax on the electricity they use.\n\nFor Brian Morgenstern, the head of public policy at Riot Platforms, one of the largest, publicly traded bitcoin miners based in the U.S., these policy suggestions, updates, and rule changes clearly indicate a larger attempt to hinder Bitcoin advancement by targeting financial choke points.\n\n\u201cThe White House has proposed an excise tax on electricity use by Bitcoin mining businesses specifically \u2014 an admitted attempt to control legal activity they do not like, in the name of environmental protection\u201d, Morgenstern explained in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe only explanation for such inexplicable behavior is deep-rooted bias in favor of the status quo and against decentralization.\u201d\n\nCollectively, this behavior could influence the conduct of regulated banks, just as the pressure applied by the DOJ in the 2010s unduly limited the businesses in its crosshairs back then. For many, it\u2019s clear that Operation Choke Point has been reinstated.\n\n\u201c\u2018Operation Choke Point 2.0\u2019 refers to the coordinated effort by the Biden administration\u2019s financial regulators to suffocate our domestic crypto economy by de-banking the industry and severing entrepreneurs from the capital necessary to invest here in America\u201d, U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty, a member of the committees on banking and appropriations, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt appears that financial regulators have bought into the false narrative that cryptocurrency-focused businesses solely exist to facilitate or conduct illicit activities, and they seem blind to the opportunities for the potential innovations and new businesses that can be built.\u201d\n\nPressure Where It Hurts\n\nIt may be fairly obvious how such a pressure campaign by federal regulators would hurt cryptocurrency-focused projects that depend on access to banks. But the larger ramifications of such financial prohibitions for retail customers and the advancement of Bitcoin in particular may not be.\n\nWhy should proponents of Bitcoin, a decentralized financial rail designed to function outside of the legacy system, care about a choke point in regulated financial institutions?\n\nCaitlin Long, the founder of Custodia Bank, which is focused on bridging the gap between digital assets and legacy financial services, recognizes that for users in the U.S. to legitimately participate in Bitcoin, the regulatory landscape must be accommodating.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working for years to help enable laws to be enacted, in multiple U.S. states and federally, precisely because in the absence of legal clarity about Bitcoin, legal systems can become attack vectors on Bitcoiners\u201d, she said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAll of us live under legal regimes of some sort, and we should be aware of legal attack vectors and work toward resolving them in an enabling way.\u201d\n\nLong\u2019s advocacy may best represent the potential that favorable or even just equitable financial access could mean for Bitcoin adoption and the advancement of its technology for everyone. Through her work, Custodia (then under the name Avanti) obtained a 2020 bank charter in its home state of Wyoming that made it a special-purpose depository institution capable of custodying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients. But, following a prolonged delay in approval of Custodia\u2019s application for a master account with the Federal Reserve that would allow it to leverage the FedWire network and facilitate large transactions for clients without enrolling intermediaries, Custodia filed a lawsuit against the Fed last year.\n\n\u201cOperation Choke Point 2.0 is real \u2014 Custodia learned about its existence in late January when press leaks hit and reporters started calling Custodia to say they learned that all bank charter applicants at the Fed and OCC with digital assets in their business models, including Custodia, were recently asked to withdraw their pending applications\u201d, Long said. \u201cReporters told us that the Fed\u2019s vote on Custodia\u2019s application would be a foregone conclusion before the Fed governors actually voted.\u201d\n\nBut, more than just stifling innovators who seek to build bridges between Bitcoin and legacy financial services, targeting the choke points of Bitcoin platforms will only push these platforms outside of the scope of regulators, giving those with malicious intent an advantage over those who are attempting to play by the rules.\n\n\u201cInternet-native money exists. It won\u2019t be uninvented\u201d, Long added. \u201cIf federal bank regulators have a prayer of controlling its impact on the traditional U.S. dollar banking system, they will wake up and realize it\u2019s in their interest to enable regulatory-compliant bridges. Otherwise, just as with other industries that the internet has disrupted \u2014 corporate media, for example \u2014 the internet will just go around them and they will face even bigger problems down the road.\u201d\n\nAs was laid bare by the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Bitcoin is still very much tied to the world of cryptocurrency at large in the portfolios of investors and the eyes of most people around the world. Indeed, the revelations around FTX\u2019s criminal operations have been a case in point for regulators who seek the financial prohibition of cryptocurrency businesses. But this very prohibition may have enabled FTX\u2019s operators to fleece billions in customer funds: Based on a Caribbean island, the vast majority of FTX\u2019s business was outside of the jurisdiction of U.S. regulators. As U.S. regulators limit the growth of domestic businesses, offshore alternatives like FTX benefit.\n\nAnd while many Bitcoiners may think that policymakers are powerless to determine the success of this permissionless technology, adverse or absent regulations can limit Bitcoin-specific businesses just as harshly as they do broader, cryptocurrency-related ones. In fact, it may be Bitcoin\u2019s unique properties that make the current regulatory landscape such a daunting one for growth.\n\n\u201cBitcoiners should care about Operation Choke Point 2.0 because certain policymakers are trying to take away our ability to participate in the Bitcoin network\u201d, Morgenstern argued. \u201cMoreover, Bitcoin is different. It is not only the oldest and most tested asset in this space, it is perhaps the only one that everyone agrees is a digital commodity. That means the on-ramp for inclusion into any policy frameworks will have less friction inherently, and Bitcoiners need to understand this.\u201d\n\nRelieving The Choke Points\n\nReviewing the recent, hostile policy updates from federal regulators, it seems clear that Bitcoin is firmly entrenched along with \u201ccrypto\u201d in their minds. And, Bitcoin proponents in particular will agree, many businesses focused on other cryptocurrencies are apt to hurt investors. But some in the Bitcoin sector think that more education could help underscore the distinctions between Bitcoin and altcoins, and better protect Bitcoin from more justified regulatory limits on manipulated tokens and vaporware.\n\n\u201cEngage with your elected officials\u201d, Morgenstern encouraged. \u201cHelp them understand that Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized ledger technology is democratizing finance, creating faster and cheaper transactions and providing much-needed optionality for consumers at a time when the centralized finance system is experiencing distress. This will take time, effort and a lot of communication, but we must work together to help our leaders appreciate how many votes and how much prosperity is at stake.\u201d\n\nIndeed, for those elected officials who do recognize this bias as unduly harmful to innovation, continued advocacy from Bitcoin\u2019s supporters is the best way out of the choke hold.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t an issue where people can afford to be on the sidelines anymore\u201d, Hagerty concluded. \u201cI encourage those who want to see digital assets flourish in the United States to make your voice heard, whether that is at the ballot box or by contacting your lawmakers and urging them to support constructive policy proposals.\u201d\n\nThis article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s \u201cThe Withdrawal Issue\u201d.

        "title": "Bitcoin's Energy Consumption Debate: Unpacking the Latest Developments - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The ongoing discussion over Bitcoin's energy use has captivated the world's attention. Concerns about the flagship cryptocurrency's environmental impact have grown as it has grown in popularity and value. Bitcoin's energy-intensive mining process, critics contend, contributes to carbon emissions and exacerbates climate change. Proponents, on the other hand, underline the possibility of a greener Bitcoin future and the importance of distinguishing between energy sources.\n\nBitcoin Mining Consumes a Lot of Energy\n\nThe mining process is at the heart of the Bitcoin energy consumption argument. Mining is the process of creating new bitcoins and adding transactions to the blockchain. It entails solving complex mathematical riddles with specialized hardware, which is referred to as Proof of Work (PoW).\n\nPoW mining necessitates a huge amount of computational power, resulting in significant energy consumption. The miners compete to solve problems, and the winner receives newly produced bitcoins. This energy-intensive method has been criticized, especially in an era when sustainability and environmental concerns are top priorities.\n\nTesla's U-turn on Bitcoin and the Environment\n\nElon Musk, CEO of electric vehicle producer Tesla, officially declared that Tesla will take Bitcoin as payment for its automobiles, which was a watershed point in the Bitcoin energy consumption discussion. However, Musk quickly altered his decision, expressing concerns about Bitcoin's environmental impact.\n\nMusk's comments spurred a broader discussion on the carbon impact of bitcoin. Bitcoin's energy consumption, according to critics, exceeds that of entire countries, while supporters believe that the cryptocurrency's energy consumption should be evaluated in the context of its potential advantages and the broader financial system.\n\nThe 50% Renewable Energy Benchmark\n\nThe adoption of renewable energy sources in Bitcoin mining has reached a significant milestone, with over 50% of mining energy now coming from sustainable sources. This shift has been driven by several factors, including the dispersal of miners from China following the country's mining ban in 2021 and the utilization of stranded and excess energy resources by certain nations for mining purposes.\n\nSustainable Energy Sources Rise >50%\n\n\ud83d\udc49Falling emissions plus a dramatically rising hash rate can only mean one thing; Bitcoin mining is consuming more sustainable energy in its mix. pic.twitter.com/AGXrKWDWuI \u2014 Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) September 14, 2023\n\nAs of September 14, Bloomberg analyst Jamie Coutts reported on X (formerly Twitter) that more than 50% of Bitcoin mining energy is now sourced from renewable and sustainable sources.\n\nThis achievement is notable as it demonstrates a commitment to reducing the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining.\n\nSeveral countries have actively embraced Bitcoin mining and renewable energy. El Salvador, for instance, not only recognized Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 but has also invested in mining operations. Other nations such as Bhutan, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates have also shown interest in both Bitcoin mining and sustainable energy sources.\n\nAchieving the 50% renewable energy benchmark in Bitcoin mining is a significant step toward making the cryptocurrency industry more environmentally friendly. This shift may also pave the way for greater acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin by large corporations and institutions concerned about the environmental impact of cryptocurrency.\n\nPerspectives Shifting: The Push for Renewable Energy\n\nOne major aspect in the Bitcoin energy discussion is the increased emphasis on mining with renewable energy sources. Proponents contend that switching to cleaner energy can reduce Bitcoin's environmental impact. Some mining enterprises have relocated in recent years to areas with ample renewable energy, such as hydropower.\n\nNotably, numerous well-known Bitcoin mining companies have pledged to use renewable energy. These measures are considered as a step in the right direction toward making Bitcoin more sustainable. However, the scalability of such initiatives, as well as their long-term impact on Bitcoin's energy consumption, remain open questions.\n\nEl Salvador's Experiment with Bitcoin as Legal Tender\n\nEl Salvador's decision to accept Bitcoin as legal cash introduced a new wrinkle to the argument over energy consumption. While supporters consider this as a big step toward Bitcoin's general acceptance, detractors warn that it may compound the cryptocurrency's energy usage problems.\n\nThe use of geothermal energy for mining in El Salvador has been mentioned as a potential green alternative, however the practicality and sustainability of this technique remain unknown. Protests and legal challenges have erupted in response to the government's decision, highlighting the complications of integrating Bitcoin into a nation's economy.\n\nInstitutional Investors and Sustainability as an ESG Factor\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are becoming increasingly important in the financial world, and Bitcoin's energy use is no exception. Institutional investors, such as asset managers and pension funds, are increasingly incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations into their investment decisions.\n\nAddressing ESG concerns is critical for Bitcoin to acquire wider institutional acceptance. Some investors are looking towards environmentally friendly cryptocurrencies like as Proof of Stake (PoS) alternatives, which use substantially less energy than Bitcoin's PoW-based counterpart. Others are collaborating with Bitcoin mining businesses to promote environmentally friendly operations.\n\nRegulatory Inquiry and the Search for Solutions\n\nRegulators around the world are keeping a tight eye on the bitcoin field, and concerns about energy use are on their radar. There are concerns in some countries about implementing environmental limitations on Bitcoin mining facilities. Regulatory decisions in this area may have a big impact on Bitcoin's future.\n\nTo overcome these issues, researchers, entrepreneurs, and cryptocurrency developers are actively investigating more energy-efficient consensus algorithms than PoW. Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Authority (PoA) are two such instances. These consensus algorithms seek to lower energy usage while maintaining the blockchain's security and integrity.\n\nBitcoin's Promise and Environmental Responsibility in Balance\n\nThe Bitcoin energy consumption discussion emphasizes the importance of striking a careful balance between realizing the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies and mitigating their environmental impact. Bitcoin, also known as \"digital gold,\" provides decentralization, censorship resistance, and financial inclusion to people all around the world. Its importance as a medium of commerce and a store of wealth cannot be overstated.\n\nHowever, it is evident that Bitcoin's energy consumption merits investigation and novel solutions. As the Bitcoin ecosystem evolves, it is critical to investigate sustainable alternatives and shift mining operations to greener energy sources. This transition could be critical for Bitcoin to coexist peacefully with rising ESG concerns and regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe Road Ahead: Conclusion\n\nThe Bitcoin energy usage argument is still active and varied. It highlights the difficulty in reconciling innovation, financial inclusion, and sustainability. As the bitcoin ecosystem evolves, parties ranging from miners to regulators will need to work together to discover viable solutions.\n\nThe cryptocurrency community has launched projects to use renewable energy sources, investigate energy-efficient consensus techniques, and connect with ESG-conscious investors in the hunt for a greener Bitcoin. These initiatives reflect a rising awareness of environmental issues and a commitment to solve them.\n\nFinally, the route forward will necessitate a sophisticated strategy that recognizes both the revolutionary potential of cryptocurrencies and the duty to reduce their environmental effect. The Bitcoin energy usage argument will continue to impact the future of cryptocurrencies and their place in the global financial landscape as developments unfold and technology improves."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s dominance rebounds to 50%, signaling a market shift.\n\nRising whale and retail interest, along with increased active addresses, impact Bitcoin\u2019s market dynamics.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] recent price dip from its $26,000 mark, it has managed to maintain a firm grip of its dominance in the market. This raised questions about the fate of alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nBitcoin domination continues\n\nRecent data indicated that Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance soared back to 50%, signaling a loss of market share for alternative cryptocurrencies. In essence, this means that Bitcoin has become a more significant player in the market, overshadowing its competitors.\n\nAdditionally, whale interest in Bitcoin was on the rise. The number of addresses holding significant amounts of the cryptocurrency reached new highs. This trend can have both positive and negative implications for the market.\n\nOn the one hand, it indicated growing confidence among large investors. On the other hand, it raised concerns about the concentration of wealth within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n? #Bitcoin $BTC Number of Addresses Holding 1+ Coins just reached an ATH of 1,020,176 Previous ATH of 1,020,156 was observed on 10 September 2023 View metric:https://t.co/s7tx1xxyz3 pic.twitter.com/Nhq7NyST5w \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) September 14, 2023\n\nRetail interest was also surging, with a record number of addresses holding smaller amounts of BTC. This increased retail participation can impact market dynamics. It suggests that Bitcoin is becoming more accessible and appealing to everyday investors, potentially driving further adoption.\n\nActive addresses on the network also surged, hitting a four-month high. This uptick in activity can indicate growing interest and engagement within the community. It means more people are actively using Bitcoin, which can be a sign of a healthy and vibrant ecosystem.\n\n? #Bitcoin $BTC Number of Active Addresses (7d MA) just reached a 4-month high of 59,829.149 Previous 4-month high of 59,694.798 was observed on 13 September 2023 View metric:https://t.co/SUxtdZ0Wuc pic.twitter.com/mgT3fDvdtj \u2014 glassnode alerts (@glassnodealerts) September 14, 2023\n\nHowever, some metrics like the MVRV ratio and long-short difference have declined. These indicators suggest that short-term holders may be increasing in number. This could lead to more volatility in the market, as short-term traders tend to react quickly to price fluctuations.\n\nWhat are traders doing?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s open interest fell which could affect trading dynamics and market sentiment. A decrease in open interest can imply reduced speculative activity or uncertainty in the market. Traders may be taking a cautious approach in response to recent price movements.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nIn terms of trader sentiment, long positions slightly outnumber short positions, indicating a cautious optimism among market participants. While more traders are betting on the coin\u2019s price to rise, the margin is narrow, suggesting that there is still a degree of uncertainty in the market."

        "content": "With the majority of the cryptocurrency market slowly moving to reverse the losses suffered in the previous dip, Bitcoin (BTC) is no different, and cryptocurrency experts agree that more price gains, perhaps even a new all-time high (ATH), could be in store.\n\nIndeed, pseudonymous crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade said that the next target for Bitcoin could be $46,000, based on the linear chart that has demonstrated a similar track in the period between 2018 and 2021, according to the analysis shared on September 15.\n\nBitcoin linear chart analysis. Source: Trader Tardigrade\n\nNew record in the making?\n\nEarlier, the crypto expert projected that the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset would witness a \u201cparabolic rally\u201d and perhaps even reach a new record, stating that Bitcoin \u201chas never lost its track\u201d and that the \u201cnew Bitcoin ATH is brewing in this post-Shakeout Bull Run.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, in the most recent post on social media, he highlighted that $30,000 would be a foundation for Bitcoin\u2019s takeoff toward the new ATH. Specifically, as he explained:\n\n\u201cBefore reaching ATH, BTC will pullback to $30k. $30k will be the new floor!!\u201d\n\nAt the same time, a renowned crypto trading expert Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe stressed that Bitcoin \u201cmight be ready to start the bull cycle\u201d if it \u201cholds above the 200-week [exponential moving average (EMA)], and it should hold above that level,\u201d arguing that \u201cit\u2019s the best period of the cycle to accumulate your altcoins.\u201d\n\nBitcoin price action analysis.

Discover SCENE\n\nCrypto gaming and metaverse investment giant Animoca Brands has unveiled plans this week through one of its subsidiary companies to launch a first-of-its-kind metaverse ecosystem token on Bitcoin via the Ordinals protocol.\n\nGame studio Darewise Entertainment (aka Life Beyond Studios), an Animoca subsidiary, aims to create an all-encompassing metaverse ecosystem built around Bitcoin Ordinals\u2014a protocol that lets users inscribe NFT-like assets to the blockchain and create BRC-20 tokens on Bitcoin.\n\nThe studio\u2019s metaverse plan includes gaming, brand integrations, real-world experiences, and more. Darewise is the studio behind Life Beyond, an upcoming metaverse game with NFTs. It will be the first game to implement the newly announced Bitcoin-based metaverse token for in-game assets, virtual lands, and more.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe have exciting news! \ud83c\udf89@darewise Entertainment , the builders of Life Beyond have just revealed its strategic engagement with @HorizenLabs to launch the first metaverse ecosystem token on #Bitcoin\ud83d\udcf7. @animocabrands Full details: https://t.co/pXJu7ysDpv \u2014 Life Beyond (@LifeBeyond) September 14, 2023\n\nTo create the upcoming Bitcoin token, Darewise will collaborate with Horizen Labs, the company that helped develop the smart contract and token strategy for ApeCoin (APE)\u2014the Ethereum-based token tied to the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT project. Life Beyond has previously released gaming NFTs on Ethereum scaling network Polygon.\n\n\u201cI'm very excited for our Life Beyond Studios to be pioneering the use of Bitcoin Ordinals,\u201d Animoca Brands CEO Robby Yung told Decrypt.\n\nYung added that continuous innovation is a hallmark of the Web3 industry, and with the emergence of Ordinals on the scene this year, it's only fitting that Animoca would try to push the envelope in their application.\n\nOrdinal inscriptions are digital assets that are digitally archived to a single satoshi, the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin (1/100,000,000 BTC). Although trading activity around these virtual artifacts is down in recent months, new products are continuously surfacing including a social graph and another planned Bitcoin metaverse ecosystem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe're still in the early innings, but the potential for Bitcoin to become more than just a store of value is immense,\u201d said Benjamin Charbit, co-founder and CEO of Darewise Entertainment, in a statement.\n\nAnimoca Brands is a major player in the metaverse space and has invested in hundreds of companies and projects, netting a $5.9 billion valuation as of September 2022.\n\nThe company also publishes various NFT-based games, including the Ethereum metaverse game The Sandbox. Animoca recently raised $20 million in funding for its new metaverse project, The Mocaverse, one of many such gaming initiatives under its umbrella.\n\nYung clarified to Decrypt that the Bitcoin metaverse token is \u201cseparate from the Mocaverse, although Life Beyond Studios are a part of the project.\u201d He added there will be further \u201ccollaborations between the AAA universe they're building and the wider Mocaverse.\u201d"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nIt was another week of fairly stable prices for leading cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) grew 3% over the seven days and started Saturday trading at $26,564, while Ethereum (ETH) remains more or less at the same price it was seven days ago at $1,636.\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum\u2019s growth may have been hobbled by reports that its supply recently turned inflationary (meaning more Ether is issued than burned) in one of few such periods since the Merge in September 2022. Last week, Ethereum\u2019s supply increased by 4,092 ETH tokens worth around $6.6 million, per Ultrasound.money data.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrencies traded sideways all week, even after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 (BLS) latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday revealed that inflation had risen a fraction above economists\u2019 projections last month due to rising gasoline prices.\n\nOnly three cryptocurrencies posted any notable price movement this week. Two tokens rallied: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) grew 11.5% to $213.79, while Toncoin (TON) blew up 23% to trade at $2.20.\n\nTON\u2019s explosive price movement this week was catalyzed by news on Wednesday that its parent company\u2014Telegram\u2014has integrated The Open Network blockchain\u2019s Web3 wallet into its messaging app, bringing easy access to TON for the app\u2019s 800 million users.\n\nThe move represents a symbolic win for Telegram. Technically, the company withdrew from involvement in TON in 2020 after litigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Telegram was accused of offering unregistered securities in the form of a token called Gram. It settled with the SEC by paying a fine of $18.5 million and returning unspent funds to investors.\n\nOne cryptocurrency notably depreciated over the week: Stellar (XLM) fell 9.3% to trade at $0.118263 at the time of writing. Its poor performance this week appears to be a correction from last week, when XLM rallied 10% off the back of a tweet that promised \u201csomething cool\u201d in ten days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWas it a major network overhaul? Nope, it was a big-budget commercial with Idris Elba.\n\nIn the news: adoption!\n\nThere were more encouraging signs of crypto adoption throughout the global north this week.\n\nOn Monday, Sony subsidiary Sony Network Communications announced it was developing a blockchain network in collaboration with crypto tech firm Startale Labs. The Singapore-based joint venture will be known as Sony Network Communications Labs Pte. Ltd. It remains unclear what Sony may use the platform for.\n\nAmerican payments giant PayPal launched crypto to USD off-ramps on Tuesday. The move came after PayPal launched a crypto On Ramp integration last month, enabling direct crypto purchases to MetaMask and Ledger users. Undoubtedly, the company\u2019s biggest move in the space this year was the announcement of its own in-house greenback-pegged stablecoin PayPal USD.\n\nFinally, on Wednesday, Taurus\u2013a Swiss crypto fintech firm\u2014announced an agreement with Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank will also use Taurus\u2019 infrastructure to offer custody and tokenization services for its customers, according to a press release shared with Decrypt."

        "content": "As long-time readers will know, I have been encouraging readers to buy Bitcoin since 2013. I continue to do so. Everybody should own some Bitcoin. Its potential is too enormous to ignore, and I feel a percentage of everybody\u2019s portfolio should be allocated to it. If I had a Bitcoin for every person who has come up to me and said how they should have bought it when they first heard me talking about it, but didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be richer than Bitcoin\u2019s founders.\n\nBy owning bitcoin you are effectively owning shares in perhaps the most technologically brilliant system of money in history. The technology is already becoming the template for national currencies in the form of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) but as supranational money for the borderless medium\n\nthat is the internet, and with its capacity for micropayments, bitcoin\u2019s potential scalability dwarfs that of national currencies.\n\nWith its finite supply, it has the potential to become a widespread online-savings vehicle for both individuals and corporations. Bitcoin benefits from its incredibly robust blockchain (the digital ledger that underpins the cryptocurrency). It is well-established as the first and foremost cryptocurrency, making it easier to expand its network. Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network, a blockchain-based technology, makes Bitcoin transactions incredibly quick.\n\nSubscribe to MoneyWeek Subscribe to MoneyWeek today and get your first six magazine issues absolutely FREE Get 6 issues free Sign up to Money Morning Don't miss the latest investment and personal finances news, market analysis, plus money-saving tips with our free twice-daily newsletter Don't miss the latest investment and personal finances news, market analysis, plus money-saving tips with our free twice-daily newsletter Sign up\n\nGiven all this, in a world of artificial intelligence (AI) and automated payments, it has the potential to become the default cash system for the internet, the standard on which internet monies, from the M-Pesa to Air Miles, are based. Why not have a piece of that potential pie?\n\nIf I look at the combined average IQ of people in the Bitcoin sector and compare it with, say, gold mining, there is no contest. Bitcoin abounds with brain boxes. By owning Bitcoin, you are effectively leveraging this extraordinarily high combined IQ.\n\nI don\u2019t think it is going to the moon tomorrow. Bitcoin tends to go through a cycle. The first phase I call \u201cquiet accumulation\u201d, which is followed by \u201cfrenzy and a blow-off top\u201d. Thirdly, there is the \u201cmonster correction\u201d. Finally, we reach a stage of \u201cfrustrating consolidation\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re somewhere in phase four or one, although such phases can last a long time. But news broke a fortnight ago of what could prove a landmark court ruling for bitcoin. The Financial Times, traditionally sceptical about Bitcoin, called it \u201ca big win\u201d.\n\nLegal imbroglios\n\nThe decision concerned the Greyscale Bitcoin Trust which was listed in the US in 2013 and buys and holds Bitcoin. So in buying the trust investors are, in effect, buying Bitcoin, or at least getting exposure to the Bitcoin price. Greyscale now has something like $17bn under management.\n\nHowever, investors cannot sell their shares and redeem them for Bitcoin. They can only sell them to someone else. This means in effect that the trust cannot sell its Bitcoin: the amount of Bitcoin in the trust can only increase (as it issues more shares). At first the trust traded at a considerable premium to the Bitcoin price: it was the only way investors could own Bitcoin via a broker. At times Greyscale traded at double the value of its Bitcoin holdings. However, in recent years this reversed, so that by December last year the trust was trading at a 50% discount to the Bitcoin price. What was the point of owning the trust then, if it doesn\u2019t track the Bitcoin price?\n\nGreyscale had a problem. The solution was to convert the trust into an exchange-traded fund , so it would be able to buy and sell Bitcoin according to the market\u2019s demand, thus accurately tracking the price. For years Greyscale has been trying to get permission. But the US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), rejected its application.\n\nA question of balance\n\nThe SEC has repeatedly ruled against other Bitcoin ETF applications too. There have been so many. The Winklevoss brothers tried to get one listed. So did Cathie Wood. They were all rejected. There are at least half a dozen other proposals under consideration from the likes of BlackRock, WisdomTree and Fidelity. But it is clear that the SEC, like the UK\u2019s City regulator, the FCA, does not like crypto. Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, has issued a plethora of regulatory actions against the likes of Coinbase and Binance. The latter is the largest crypto exchange in the world.\n\nTo be balanced, the SEC has approved ETFs based on Bitcoin futures. But it has argued, not so unreasonably given its remit, that bitcoin trades on unregulated exchanges and can be prone to market manipulation.\n\nA fortnight ago, however, a federal appeal court in Washington ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject the Bitcoin ETF application Greyscale brought last year. \u201cThe denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products,\u201d said one of the three judges. The Grayscale appeal focused on one simple question: whether it could offer a spot Bitcoin ETF that would expose retail investors to the real-time price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe fact is that there is a lot of demand for a Bitcoin spot ETF, not just in the US but worldwide. We shall see if the SEC now appeals, but the upshot is that a spot bitcoin ETF now looks a lot more likely. An ETF will open up entirely new markets for bitcoin both at the retail and the institutional level. It will bring a lot more money into Bitcoin. With Bitcoin limited supply, that has to be very bullish.\n\nWith a Bitcoin ETF in the US, the FCA here in the UK will almost certainly have to reevaluate its anti-crypto stance, which has made it so difficult for UK investors to invest in this sector via traditional brokers. We shall see.\n\nThis article was first published in MoneyWeek's magazine.

        "content": "Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has never been shy about expressing his opinions on various investments. And when it comes to bitcoin, he has made his views abundantly clear.\n\nAt the 2022 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting, Buffett compared bitcoin to farmland and apartment complexes, stating, \u201cIf the people in this room owned all the farmland and you said for a 1% interest in all the farmland in the United States, pay us the bargain price, $25 billion dollars, I\u2019d write you a check for $25 billion. If you did the same with all the apartment complexes in the United States for bargain price, I\u2019d write you a check. Now if you told me you owned all the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it?\u201d\n\nBuffett\u2019s reasoning behind this statement is based on the fundamental value of assets. Farmland and apartments produce tangible value in the form of food and rental income, respectively. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have any inherent productive value. As Buffett pointed out, \u201cThe apartments are going to produce rental, and the farmland is going to produce food, and if I\u2019ve got all the bitcoin, it\u2019s a mystery.\u201d\n\nBuffett further expressed skepticism about the long-term prospects of bitcoin, saying, \u201cWhether it goes up or down in the next year or five or ten years, the one thing I\u2019m pretty sure of is it doesn\u2019t multiply. There\u2019s a magic to it, and people attach magic to lots of things.\u201d\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nBuffett is not alone in his skepticism about bitcoin. His longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, has also expressed his negative views on the cryptocurrency. At the same annual meeting, Munger stated, \u201cIn my life I try to avoid things that are stupid, and evil, and make me look bad in comparison to somebody else\u2026 well bitcoin does all three. First, it\u2019s stupid because it\u2019s very likely to go to zero, second, it\u2019s evil because it compromises the federal reserve system and the Nation Currency system. And lastly, China banned it, so we look more dumb then them.\u201d\n\nBoth Buffett and Munger have long been proponents of investing in businesses that produce tangible value over the long term. Their skepticism about bitcoin stems from the fact that it does not have any inherent productive value and its future prospects are highly uncertain.\n\nWhile some investors view bitcoin as a potential store of value or a hedge against inflation, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger see it as a speculative investment with no inherent productive value. Their comments at the 2022 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting highlight their belief in investing in assets that produce tangible value over the long term, and their skepticism about the long-term prospects of bitcoin. Whether you agree with their views or not, it\u2019s always important to consider multiple perspectives before making investment decisions.\n\nEditor's note: This article was produced via automated technology and then fine-tuned and verified for accuracy by a member of GOBankingRates' editorial team.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nMore From GOBankingRates"

Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nShort-term holders can\u2019t dream now\n\nCrazzyblockk, who posts regularly about the market sentiment on CryptoQuant, pointed to the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio as grounds for his opinion. The MVRV ratio is calculated as the ratio of an asset\u2019s market capitalization versus its realized cap.\n\nBy comparing these two metrics, the metric can be used to get a sense of when the price is above or below \u201cfair value\u201d, and to assess market profitability.\n\nFrom the chart above, and as confirmed by Crazzyblockk, the MVRV ratio was above 1. Explaining how the metric relates to the price and market cap, Crazzyblockk concluded:\n\n\u201cWe are still above level 1 of the MVRV Ratio, and based on the Holders\u2019 Cost basis, Realized Cap< Market cap.\u201d\n\nHowever, the analyst mentioned that the bullish long-term picture does not apply to short-term holders. In addressing this part, Crazzyblockk explained that there was little to no confidence in the market that could change the sentiment, saying that short-term holders were at a \u201chuge disadvantage.\u201d\n\nWatch out for $27,500\n\nBut for the mid-term, the analyst mentioned that there was hope for relief. He also added that Bitcoin\u2019s potential to rise above $30,000 would depend on the $27,500 to $29,000 break-even zone.\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, Crazzyblockk analyzed the state of the Bitcoin realized price. The realized price gives the average cost basis at which all Bitcoins were purchased. This is done by considering the value of all BTC at the price they were last transacted on-chain, divided by the number of bitcoins in circulation. So, the analyst wrote,\n\n\u201cIf we look at the average realized price of these holders or the amount of money they have paid for each bitcoin, the price levels of 27.5k-29k is the break-even area of these holders\u2019 pockets.\u201d\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nIn the interim, Crazzyblockk gave a strong warning. According to him, BTC remaining lower than the aforementioned realized prices poses a great risk to the mid-term project. He opined that the longer Bitcoin stays lower than $27,500 the longer it might take to recover. He explained that."

        "title": "BlackRock rumors of shifted focus from Bitcoin to XRP fails to deflate BTC Spot ETF flare - FXStreet",
        "content": "Rumors of BlackRock pivoting its digital currency strategy from Bitcoin to XRP caught fire on social media platform X.\n\nIt sprouts from speculation about the asset manager reassessing its digital asset strategy through portfolio diversification.\n\nMeanwhile, BlackRock is arguably the only positive news around Bitcoin this year, with BTC spot ETF still at the helm of investor interest.\n\nBlackRock asset manager is making headlines on giant social media platform X, only this time not for the usual Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) theme. It comes on the back of speculation that the company could be looking to reassess its digital asset investment. The asset manager is known to have huge volumes of Bitcoin in its holdings. Could it be looking to pivot elsewhere, and if so, what would it mean for the broader digital asset landscape?\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin correlation cheat sheet for portfolio diversification\n\nBlackRock reassessing its digital asset strategy?\n\nBlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, boasting more than $9.1 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM), is trending on social media, and while this is not the first time, the reason is quite concerning. After the ETF-related mania, where BlackRock was among the institutional players in the race to have its Bitcoin Spot ETF filing approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the asset manager is speculated to be shifting its gaze towards XRP.\n\nThe speculation points to a reassessment of the firm's digital asset investment strategy from the flagship crypto to the payments token. Nevertheless, these remain rumors because while the firm has recently been making cautious strides into the crypto market, there is no said evidence to suggest a shifted focus from BTC to XRP.\n\nPossible Implications for XRP\n\nTo play the devil's advocate, XRP's market value could increase if the rumors turn out to be true because of enhanced credibility within the financial services space. Remember, it is a remittance token with multiple applications as it stands, especially in facilitating cross-border transactions. The move would also point to an evolving trend in the market, with institutional investors steadily embracing portfolio diversification to feature other assets aside from Bitcoin, which, as it stands, is limited by scalability and environmental concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, Ripple price remains unfazed by this speculation because of its unfounded nature, with no hints or clear statements from Ripple Labs or BlackRock.\n\nCorrecting the narrative\n\nThe rumor is based on the changing regulatory environment in the US surrounding crypto. Noteworthy, the underlying message about regulation presenting as an obstacle is true. This was indicated by the hesitance or skepticism of banks to use cryptocurrencies because of the absence of clarity on whether financial institutions are allowed to use crypto tokens for their services. As such, the changes and clarity approaching the XRP doors could excite players' interest.\n\nHowever, to say that the current regulatory stance is affecting the BlackRock investment strategy is unfounded, and using rumors of the asset manager shifting focus from Bitcoin to XRP as a bullish fundamental for the payments token could be premature, according to experts.\n\n$XRP Will Be Bought By Blackrock!?\n\n\n\nHuge XRP News Today - HBAR, ALGORAND & More!\n\n\n\nHad to dispel some stupid rumours going around about XRP today!\n\n\n\nNew video is out now! pic.twitter.com/Lt6agXadZn \u2014 MASON VERSLUIS (@MasonVersluis) September 15, 2023\n\nAs it stands, the focus remains on BTC spot ETFs, with crypto enthusiasts eagerly waiting for a decision from the SEC. BlackRock remains among the leading prospects, considering its heft in the space and the successful record of accomplishment with only one rejection against more than 500 approvals thus far.\n\nAlso Read US SEC likely to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, catalyzing marketwide recovery in crypto."

        "content": "Bitcoin ended its four-week price decline, recording its first weekly gain since August. The largest crypto asset by market value has increased about 2.5% since last Saturday to about $26,458.\n\nThe digital asset was trading at $26,468, at the time of writing while market bulls are eyeing the $27,000 mark.\n\nThe surge takes Bitcoin to its highest level this month, easing concerns about a potential September downturn that could impact its impressive year-to-date performance.\n\nOn the other hand, formidable resistance is emerging for Bitcoin. The Binance order book shows a strong sell wall indicating this resistance level.\n\nResistance and Resilience\n\nHowever, strong buying is evident at $26,000. Notably, Bitcoin remained resilient in the face of higher-than-expected US inflation data released this week.\n\nRisk sentiments rebounded as US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showed a 0.6% increase in August, mainly due to rising gasoline prices, which accounted for more than half of the increase.\n\nInflation and Federal Reserve Expectations\n\nDespite this uptick in inflation data, the bulls anticipate that the Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish narrative will water down, as the agency is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its policy meeting next week.\n\nData from CoinGecko puts Bitcoin\u2019s current market capitalization at over $516 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $11.3 billion, highlighting an uptick in liquidity.\n\nRecall that the crypto market started the past week with significant losses, falling below $25,000 for the first time since mid-June on fears that bankrupt crypto exchange FTX will soon begin unloading all assets digital assets, including more than $500 million worth of bitcoin.\n\nPrice actions validated such macros as Bitcoin broke the $25,500 resistance level coinciding with the market becoming aware of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF filing in June.\n\nBTC is currently converting the $26,000 level from resistance to support. Until the end of the week, every attempt to break this level resulted in strong sales.\n\nIf Bitcoin stays above $26,000 over the weekend it could be a positive sign, at least in the short term.\n\nAltcoin Market and Catalysts\n\nConsequently, the altcoin market, which includes BNB, Solana, Tezos, and GMX, has also seen decent gains across the market spectrum.\n\nThe altcoin\u2019s rally comes days after traders sold off the tokens, raising the possibility that defunct exchange FTX will receive bankruptcy court approval to sell assets from its crypto holdings that are worth billions of dollars.\n\nThe rally puts altcoin bears, who have placed leveraged bearish bets on SOL and other tokens fearing a potential sell-off from FTX creditors, at risk of liquidation.\n\nExchanges liquidate their positions when the market goes against the trader\u2019s bet, resulting in a lack of margin and the trader not providing additional margin.\n\nForced liquidation of sell orders also added upward pressure on the SOL price, leading to a short-term price increase, as it broke the $19 resistance level.\n\nPositive news this week about asset management giant Franklin Templeton joining the race to list a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) and global lending bank Deutsche Bank\u2019s plans to delve deeper into digital asset custody and tokenization gave the bulls more ammunition, causing prices to rise."

This is less convenient than buying it on the open market because you can only purchase the exact amount the other person is willing to sell, and they set the price.\n\nBeware that P2P platforms have their own unique set of risks.\n\nP2P communication.

If you release your funds before receiving payment, they may be irreversibly lost. Price volatility. When buying and selling on a P2P trading platform, it is your responsibility to check prices before completing transactions. If the market has moved and you haven\u2019t adjusted your order, your buy or sell order may be filled at an unfavorable price.\n\nWhy don\u2019t more exchanges offer PayPal?\n\nThis is mainly due to one simple fact: PayPal supports chargebacks, which is a problem when purchasing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis is because Bitcoin and other crypto transactions are irreversible.\n\nAs a result, someone could theoretically buy Bitcoin with PayPal, complain that they never received the BTC they purchased and ask for a chargeback. That way scammers can keep their money and essentially get Bitcoin for free.\n\nBecause of this heightened risk of fraud, there are only a handful of crypto trading platforms and exchanges that accept PayPal deposits.\n\nIs there any risk buying Bitcoin with PayPal?\n\nThere are always risks involved with buying and selling Bitcoin, but none specific to using PayPal as a deposit method.\n\nOnce you've purchased your Bitcoin, consider moving it off the platform you bought it on and into a non-custodial wallet to reduce counter-party risks.\n\nPros and cons of buying crypto with PayPal\n\nPros If you already have a PayPal account, payment is quick and convenient\n\nSafe and secure payment method\n\nAllows you to buy crypto with Australian dollars (AUD) Cons Only supported by a small number of platforms\n\nMay not be able to withdraw your funds back to your PayPal account\n\nForeign exchange fees apply on some platforms\n\nBottom line\n\nYou can use your PayPal account to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on a small number of trading platforms in Australia. The fees on these platforms are a bit higher than some other exchanges out there, but they by no means break the bank.\n\nYou can also use PayPal on a P2P market via an exchange like KuCoin, but these are much more inconvenient than buying Bitcoin from a trading platform normally.\n\nAs PayPal looks to explore cryptocurrency further, you may not have to wait long until you can buy Bitcoin from within the PayPal app in Australia.\n\nCompare platforms that accept PayPal\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I buy Bitcoin with PayPal on Coinbase? No, Coinbase does not currently accept PayPal transfers. At the time of writing, the only supported payment methods for Australian buyers are debit card or bank deposit.\n\nCan I buy Bitcoin through PayPal anonymously? Not really. While there are some platforms that allow you to buy cryptocurrency without providing any proof of ID, PayPal isn\u2019t an anonymous payment method. This is due to the fact that you\u2019ll need to fund your PayPal account from a linked bank account or credit card, which will in turn be linked to your identity.\n\nIs it possible to cash out BTC to PayPal? Yes. One option is to sell Bitcoin through a peer-to-peer marketplace that accepts PayPal, such as LocalBitcoins or Paxful, or place a trade on an exchange like VirWox. Another alternative is to use an exchange where you can sell Bitcoin for AUD, then withdraw your dollars to the credit card or bank account linked to your PayPal balance.\n\nCan I store Bitcoin in my PayPal wallet? No, you can\u2019t fund your PayPal wallet with Bitcoin and BTC cannot be stored in your PayPal wallet. Your BTC will instead need to be held in a dedicated cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nAre there other ways to buy cryptocurrency with Australian dollars? Yes, there are several crypto exchanges that offer fiat-to-crypto trading and accept deposits via bank account transfer, BPAY, POLi Payments, credit card, debit card and even cash.\n\nCan you buy Bitcoin with the PayPal app? PayPal now offers the ability to purchase Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies through the PayPal app, however, this feature is not available to residents outside of the US. PayPal has not announced any plans to rollout the feature in Australia."

        "title": "10 expert Bitcoin price predictions for 2024 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Although Bitcoin (BTC) has been going through a bit of a stagnation lately, along with the majority of the cryptocurrency market, quite a few experts are bullish about its long-term future, with the most optimistic prognoses for the maiden cryptocurrency going as high as $1 million.\n\nAs it happens, the author of the book \u201cUndressing Bitcoin,\u201d marketing consultant and podcast host Layah Heilpern, listed ten finance and investment experts and companies, along with their predictions for the price of Bitcoin in the future, in an X post shared on September 14.\n\nSpecifically, Heilpern started off with billionaire investor and venture capitalist Tim Draper, who had originally predicted that Bitcoin would reach the price of $250,000 by June 2023 but has later pushed back his prognosis for 2025, stating he hadn\u2019t expected the United States regulators to be so aggressive.\n\n$1 million in play?\n\nMeanwhile, one of the early pioneers in the cryptocurrency field and CEO of blockchain company Blockstream, Adam Back, stated in August that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 before the 2024 halving, the same number as offered by Robert Kiyosaki, who more recently said Bitcoin could even soar to $1 million if the world economy crashed.\n\nAt the same time, $1 million by 2030 is the price target for Bitcoin, also predicted by Cathie Wood, the CEO of global asset manager ARK Investment Management, back in June 2023, having reiterated that \u201cBitcoin is a hedge against inflation\u201d \u2013 a view shared by many other experts.\n\nIn July, Mike Novogratz, the CEO of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital, said Bitcoin would undoubtedly reach $500,000 in the next five years or so due to its adoption pace and unique features, such as being \u201ctailor-made to being an anti-inflation store of value.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee believes that Bitcoin is heading toward $180,000 by the end of 2024, particularly if the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nArthur Hayes, the co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, sees $70,000, slightly above Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high (ATH) of $69,045 from November 202, as the most likely scenario in a rally triggered by the possible decision of the US Federal Reserve on cutting interest rates, as he wrote in his digest on September 12.\n\nWhat companies say\n\nOn the other hand, investment banking and asset management giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) is a bit more conservative in its estimation, projecting $45,000 as a bull case scenario price for Bitcoin, provided it equals gold in risk capital or volume-adjusted terms in investors\u2019 portfolios.\n\nThat said, in its recent \u201cBlockchain Letter,\u201d published on August 22, the team at Pantera Capital, one of the leading names in crypto asset management, highlighted its bullish outlook for 2024 and projected that Bitcoin could rise to around $148,000 in its next four-year halving cycle if past trends hold.\n\nIn the meantime, Standard Chartered, one of the leading international banks in the United Kingdom that offers Bitcoin and crypto custody in the European Union through its subsidiary, Zodia Custody, has recently boosted its original $100,000 end-2024 forecast for Bitcoin to $120,000.\n\nFinally, Heilpern added her own forecast of $75,000 for the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset to the list, proceeding to place the timeline for achieving this price target at some point in 2025 in the comments.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs things stand, Bitcoin is currently changing hands at $26,631, up 1.07% on the day and growing 3.07% across the past week, while still recording losses of 8.68% on its monthly chart, as per the latest information retrieved on September 15.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAll things considered, time will tell which of the above prognoses \u2013 ranging from a modest (at this point) $45,000 to a whopping $1 million per unit of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency \u2013 was the most correct (if any).\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been locked in a relentless struggle, teetering above and below the $26,000 mark over the past few weeks.\n\nYet, a glimmer of hope emerged on September 14 when reports broke out that BTC achieved a significant milestone, which could pave the way for the cryptocurrency to regain its status as a payment option at Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), bringing a fresh wave of optimism to the crypto community.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s rewind a bit.\n\nIn February 2021, Tesla disclosed a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin \u201cto further diversify and maximize returns on\u201d its cash reserves. In addition, the world\u2019s biggest electric carmaker announced its plan to begin accepting BTC as a payment method, making it the first major auto manufacturer to do so.\n\nHowever, the hype was short-lived. Just a few months later, Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla made a U-turn and said it would suspend vehicle purchases using BTC, citing worries over the rising use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and trading.\n\n\u201cTesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about the rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.\u201d \u2013 the company stated at the time.\n\nNotably, Musk then said that Tesla would restart Bitcoin payments after BTC miners\u2019 clean energy use outstrips 50%. Remarkably, this condition has now been reportedly met, potentially marking a pivotal moment.\n\nBitcoin clean energy usage is now over 50%\n\nOn Thursday, September 14, Bloomberg analyst Jamie Coutts revealed in an X (Twitter) thread that the percentage of Bitcoin mining energy stemming from renewable sources had exceeded 50% due to \u201cfalling emissions plus a dramatically rising hash rate.\u201d\n\nThe move comes after Bitcoin miners started fleeing China following the nation\u2019s ban on mining in 2021. Furthermore, other countries forayed into crypto mining to \u201cmonetize stranded and excess energy,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nWhat does this mean for BTC price?\n\nWell, it is still too early to come to conclusions. Still, if Elon Musk brings back BTC payments thanks to growing clean energy use, it could result in a fresh surge in bullish pressure in the leading crypto asset, particularly among institutional investors.\n\nBut regardless of Musk and Tesla, Bitcoin\u2019s clean energy usage exceeding 50% nevertheless represents a significant milestone for the digital asset as it could garner the attention of other environmentally-friendly investors and companies.\n\nAt the time of writing on September 15, BTC was changing hands at $26,634, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours.\n\nBTC 1-day price chart.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market continue to grapple with prolonged bearish sentiments, leaving investors vigilant for potential factors that could trigger a rally. Notably, analysts are closely monitoring indicators that might signal the conclusion of the bear market in its second year.\n\nIn particular, a crypto analyst known by the pseudonym Seth_fin in an X post (formerly Twitter) on September 16 sparked optimism by identifying two technical indicators pointing toward a potentially bullish future.\n\nIn his post, the analyst noted that the Bitcoin Gaussian channel has turned green, which can be interpreted as a bullish signal and a possible reversal of the prevailing bearish trend. The Gaussian channel indicator is a technical tool derived from statistical concepts that predict price trend directions in financial markets.\n\nSecondly, he pointed out that the Bollinger Band Width Percentile has reached its lowest level, indicating an impending increase in price volatility.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Gaussian channel just turned green, and we\u2019ve retested the mid-band! Looks like the bear market might be in the rearview mirror. But that\u2019s not all! The Bollinger Band Width Percentile is at its lowest, signaling an impending EXPLOSIVE move!\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Seth_Fin\n\nThe analyst refrained from making a specific directional prediction, emphasizing that the Bollinger Band Width Percentile while signaling heightened volatility, does not specify the direction of the movement.\n\nPossible bullish triggers for Bitcoin\n\nHe did, however, reference the historical significance of Bitcoin halving events. These events, which reduce the rewards for miners, have historically been followed by significant price increases. The last halving event occurred in May 2020 and marked the start of a notable bull run for Bitcoin.\n\nNotably, the Bitcoin halving event continues to be hailed as a potential catalyst for a bullish price surge. At the same time, the spotlight remains on regulatory developments, particularly the potential approval of the first spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), which is expected to attract institutional capital into the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin is making an effort to maintain its position above the crucial $25,000 support level, extending a period of consolidation marked by repeated failures to breach the $30,000 mark.\n\nBitcoin is trading above $26,000, boosted by the news that Deutsche Bank, a German lender, plans to launch cryptocurrency custody services for institutional customers in partnership with Swiss fintech firm Taurus.\n\nHowever, market sentiment remains on edge due to recent developments in the FTX case. The bankruptcy court approved FTX to begin the liquidation of its extensive cryptocurrency holdings. This development has the potential to significantly impact the cryptocurrency market\u2019s dynamics, potentially leading to increased volatility. Notable assets within this substantial cache include tokens such as Solana (SOL), Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and others.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAt the time of reporting, Bitcoin was trading at $26,548, continuing its trend of weekly consolidation. Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency has registered a modest gain of approximately 0.26%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart.

A summary of these indicators suggests a \u201csell\u201d rating at 11, mirroring similar readings from moving averages (8). Oscillators also indicate a \u201csell\u201d at 3.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis price chart.
