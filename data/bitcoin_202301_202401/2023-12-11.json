        "content": "A worsening macroeconomic climate and the collapse of industry giants such as FTX and Terra have weighed on bitcoin's price this year.\n\nBitcoin fell Monday as investors took profits after its December rally.\n\nThe price of the cryptocurrency was recently lower by more than 7% at $40,887.81, according to Coinbase, after a big drop Sunday night that at one point took it as low as $40,300. Bitcoin topped $44,000 last week and traded just below that level throughout the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, ether fell 7% Monday to $2,202.92. Solana's SOL token was down 7% as well while Ripple's XRP fell about 8%. According to Coin Metrics, bitcoin and ether are on pace for their worst days since Aug. 18 and March 9, respectively.\n\nCrypto equities were dragged down, too. Coinbase fell about 5%, while MicroStrategy lost 7%. Bitcoin miners dropped double digits, with Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital , the largest mining stocks, lower by 11% and 12%, respectively. Wall Street favorites CleanSpark and Iris Energy were down nearly 15% and 14%, respectively.\n\nThe moves come after a 12% advance for bitcoin in December, according to Coin Metrics, as expectations grew that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could approve the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in early January. Galaxy Digital estimates the addressable market size of a U.S. bitcoin ETF to be about $14 trillion in the first year after a launch, growing to about $26 trillion in the second year."

        "content": "After hitting its highest point in more than a year last week, Bitcoin is falling back to Earth.\n\nThe top cryptocurrency by market cap was down just over 4% on Monday amid a selloff, trading near $41,800, down from a high of about $43,900 on Sunday. Almost $400 million was liquidated over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nStill, the coin maintained well above the key psychological marker of $40,000, pushing some analysts to believe the Monday decline was merely a speed bump on the way to an extended rally. Around $20 million flowed into exchange-traded products tracking Bitcoin last week, bringing year-to-date inflows to $1.7 billion, according to a Monday report by CoinShares.\n\n\u201cA wave of profit-taking hit the cryptocurrency market on Monday morning\u2026we saw a massive exit from long positions in low liquidity before the regular session in Asia. Strong demand for risk assets in traditional markets suggests that the market will try to get back on its previous growth track,\u201d Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at broker FxPro, told Barron\u2019s.\n\nA wave of positive sentiment last week pushed Bitcoin above $44,000, its highest level in 20 months. Fueling the boost was a hope that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a flurry of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early January. Several TradFi giants, including BlackRock and Fidelity, are waiting to hear on the status of their applications.\n\nThis week, traders will scrutinize Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for any sign that the central bank will cut rates sooner rather than later. Despite a higher-than-expected jobs report last week, inflation has recently moderated to about 3.2% compared with a high of above 9% in June 2022.\n\nAnalysts point to cooling inflation numbers as a reason to expect more dovishness from Powell at the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting of the year, on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nAlthough the Fed is not expected to cut rates this week, Goldman Sachs predicts at least two rate cuts next year. Any interest rate cut could be a boon for Bitcoin and the overall crypto market, which in recent weeks has moved above a $1.6 trillion market cap from a sub-$1 trillion market cap earlier this year.\n\nAs Bitcoin dropped on Monday, so did altcoins. The second-most popular crypto, Ether, was down 5.5%, and the previously red-hot Solana was down just under 8%. Other popular memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which rode Bitcoin\u2019s coattails to highs last week, were down 5.7% and 7.5%, respectively."

He also posted about the approval.\n\nWen volcano bond? \ud83e\udd7a \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) December 12, 2023\n\nThe news comes after several previous attempts to bring it to fruition had stalled. Bukele first announced the Volcano Bond, named after a plan to use geothermal energy from a volcano to power Bitcoin mining, in 2021, shortly after the nation adopted Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nThe bond\u2019s scheduled debut in early 2022 was postponed and then temporarily sidelined by the nation\u2019s finance minister as crypto prices plummeted. After several other delays, El Salvador\u2019s congress passed a law in January that created a legal framework for the bond.\n\nIf successful, the bond could help the Central American nation avoid defaulting on its debt, although the International Monetary Fund has for years urged El Salvador to get rid of Bitcoin as a legal currency. The nation also is seeking new revenue by offering citizenship to investors who spend $1 million on Bitcoin.\n\nThe Volcano Bond is a key project for Bukele, who led the effort to designate Bitcoin as legal tender. Funds raised by the bond were designated for the creation of a \u201cBitcoin city\u201d and for investments in Bitcoin itself. The nation\u2019s current holdings, Bukele recently announced on X, without citing evidence, are now profitable.\n\nSince hitting a 20-month high last week, Bitcoin\u2019s price has retreated to about $41,300 as of Tuesday morning."

        "content": "Wind and solar installations across the United States could reap millions of dollars from mining cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin during the early stages of renewable energy projects, according to a new study. The analysis suggests the potential to flip the script on cryptocurrency mining, which uses lots of electricity and therefore frequently generates high carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cCrypto operations such as Bitcoin mining, which are often criticized for their high energy consumption, hold the potential to play a significant role in promoting renewable energy development and aiding climate action efforts,\u201d says study team member Fengqi You, a sustainability researcher at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.\n\nAfter renewable energy projects are built, there is generally a period of time when they can generate power but are not yet hooked up to the broader electric grid, so they cannot generate any revenue. Bitcoin mining could ease the financial stress of this phase, the new study suggests.\n\nIn the study, You and his collaborators assembled data on the electricity generation potential for various wind and solar installations planned in the United States. They combined this with information about the energy and financial costs involved in Bitcoin mining, as well as the revenues that could be generated. They fed all this data into a mathematical model to determine the maximum profit that each planned renewable energy project could yield from Bitcoin mining, given the power available.\n\nAll 58 of the planned renewable energy installations assessed in the study could turn at least a small profit from Bitcoin mining, the researchers report in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering.\n\n\u201cThe extent of profitability and the potential climate benefits of combining Bitcoin mining with renewable energy installations were more significant than we initially anticipated,\u201d You says.\n\nTexas emerged as the state with the greatest potential for the scheme, with 32 planned renewable projects that could generate a total of $47 million from Bitcoin mining in the pre-grid-connection phase. California also stands out as a good place to implement the system, and Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Nevada, and Virginia have fewer installations but have significant potential for Bitcoin profitability as well.\n\n\u201cThis approach enhances the economic feasibility of renewable energy projects, thus contributing to the broader goal of reducing reliance on fossil fuels and also shifts the mining operations primarily relying on fossil-dependent grids to clean energy sources,\u201d You says.\n\nThe best renewable projects for Bitcoin mining are the ones with the most stable and consistent electricity generation, the researchers found. Solar projects tend to have greater profit potential than wind projects. The highest potential profits were seen at two solar projects in Texas, which could each generate a maximum profit of $3.23 million. The greatest potential profits for a wind energy project, also in Texas, were $2.65 million.\n\nPolicymakers could help facilitate the scheme by providing carbon credits or other economic incentives for environmentally responsible cryptocurrency mining, the researchers suggest. Policies to encourage cryptocurrency mining operations to reinvest some profits into further renewable energy development \u2013 perhaps in locations distant from the original installation \u2013 could further maximize the environmental benefits.\n\nThe approach isn\u2019t without risks, the researchers say. \u201cOne primary concern is the increasing energy intensity of Bitcoin mining. As the complexity of mining increases, it requires more computational power, which in turn can lead to higher energy consumption,\u201d You says. This could result in more fossil fuel use if the energy required for Bitcoin mining outstrips the renewable power available. It could also create a strain on the electricity supply available for local communities. So implementing the scheme will require careful planning and regulation to avoid negative impacts, You says.\n\nSource: Lal A. et al. \u201cFrom Mining to Mitigation: How Bitcoin Can Support Renewable Energy Development and Climate Action.\u201d ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering 2023.\n\nImage: \u00a9Anthropocene Magazine."

        "title": "The Bitcoin Verdict: A Conversation With Brown Rudnick Partner Matthew Richardson and Associate Morgan Jones ... - Brown Rudnick",
        "content": "In this episode of \u201cThe Bitcoin Verdict,\u201d host and partner Hailey Lennon welcomes partner Matthew Richardson and associate Morgan Jones, who discuss data privacy and cybersecurity regulations and how new technologies like blockchain and AI may be impacted by these regulations.\n\nIn the U.S. where rules differ from state to state, it\u2019s important to work with clients during a data incident to ensure their response follows the rules of the state(s) where their users live, Richardson said.\n\n\u201cIf the data subjects are all in one state, it\u2019s easy, but of course that\u2019s not realistic,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got to deal with basically 54 regimes \u2013 that\u2019s all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the USVI,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd each of them has slightly different definitions of what data is, slightly different definitions of a breach, slightly different notification requirements, slightly different time limits for those notification requirements. But mercifully, for any person that comes to us, Morgan and I do this on a daily basis, so we are perfectly capable and happy to analyze the data, analyze the breach and give a very capable and thorough understanding of what has gone on.\u201d\n\nJones added that it\u2019s important for companies to not sit on a breach and try to figure it out on their own, because once it\u2019s discovered, the clock starts ticking on the reporting requirements. He said some states have notification requirements that fall between the 30- and 60-day window, but there are a few where you have to notify either the regulator or the individuals within 10 days or so.\n\nAfter a breach happens, it\u2019s also possible for a company to face investigations into their protocol, depending on the situation, Jones explained.\n\nIn discussing how future data privacy regulations may apply to the blockchain industry, Jones said there are some implicit contradictions between GDPR requirements of the right for data to be deleted and blockchain ledgers that are immutable. For now, Jones noted that regulators are extremely focused on artificial intelligence but may turn their attentions back to blockchain and cryptocurrency in the future.\n\nHe believes the regulations for blockchain will require a different approach than AI because of the ways the different technologies collect and use data.\n\n\u201cI think the general intention of the legislators right now has been turned away a bit to focus more on AI \u2013 that\u2019s the hot button topic right now \u2013 but I think they will eventually circle back to blockchain,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think they\u2019ll take a softer touch to it than AI because AI data is being collected and shared in many instances without the consumer knowing. Whereas blockchain you\u2019re opening yourself up to this. So I think it\u2019s going to take a bit of a lighter touch and it won\u2019t be quite so drastic when it comes to cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nLennon said people who choose to buy crypto are generally very focused on the importance of data privacy, but that doesn\u2019t make it any easier to enforce those rules.\n\n\u201cFor the crypto industry and blockchain advocates, the immutability and the decentralized aspects perhaps add to an inability to comply, but also an inability to enforce in some ways,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cI know that privacy is important to individuals in the cryptocurrency space, there\u2019s privacy coins, there\u2019s zero-knowledge proof being integrated into some projects, maybe that, in some ways, is where the blockchain technology is headed in the future.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin Miners Tumble on Bitcoin's Late Night Crash - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -5.65%) miners thought they were on a bull run, but that ended at about 8 p.m. ET on Sunday night when the price of Bitcoin dropped. After trading above $43,900 late in the day, the value of Bitcoin has dropped to $40,900 as of this writing, and most of that drop happened in a matter of minutes last night.\n\nMiners fell across the industry with everyone dropping double digits today. TeraWulf (WULF -4.02%) was down as much as 23.5% in trading, Bit Digital (BTBT -6.67%) dropped 19.7%, Marathon Digital (MARA -7.46%) was down 15.2%, and Riot Platforms (RIOT -6.82%) was off 14.5% at its low.\n\nBitcoin's rapid fall\n\nWeekend trading often has less liquidity than normal trading days so assets will often see bigger moves on Saturday and Sunday. That played a role in yesterday's drop, but shares didn't recover after the fall.\n\nMiners are down even more than Bitcoin because they're a leveraged play on the industry, generating Bitcoin from mining operations as well as holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet. This means the drop in Bitcoin will hurt both the income statement and the balance sheet of these companies.\n\nInvestors are also worried about Bitcoin's next halving, which is expected to take place in 2024. Miners will only get half of the Bitcoins per block as they previously did, which will effectively lower margins for all of these companies.\n\nBitcoin giveth, Bitcoin taketh away\n\nThe drop in Bitcoin is why miners fell today, but the drop in Bitcoin itself is a little mysterious since it came so late in the weekend. Last week's economic news like a strong jobs report would have likely moved the market earlier.\n\nCoinDesk has reported that funding rates of perpetual futures contracts could have led to some of the drop. Funding rates are payments between long and short positions that are collected every eight hours and a positive funding rate indicates futures trade at a premium to the spot market. That funding rate dropped to under 0.1%, indicating less leverage in the market, likely by formerly bullish traders.\n\nBitcoin continues to be a volatile asset and investors need to understand the risk of both cryptocurrency as well as the miners involved in the industry. Bitcoin is being treated by most traders as a store of digital value and a trading asset, which means the value moves with the market's sentiment. As other cryptocurrencies and blockchains improve speed and efficiency, it appears less likely Bitcoin itself, or the Bitcoin blockchain, will be used as a form of payment.\n\nI think the mining stocks are especially risky right now given the volatility in Bitcoin and the upcoming halving. If revenue falls significantly for each block it could put these companies in a precarious position. If you're buying mining stocks, understand that it's a very leveraged position in Bitcoin and may ultimately end in disaster if Bitcoin drops."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) slid back below $41,000 this week after advancing as much as 12% in December amid optimism that the SEC will approve its first spot bitcoin ETF early next year.\n\nAnd the rally has room to run, according to Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG) CEO Greg Beard, who expects \u201ctens of billions of dollars of additional demand.\"\n\nBeard added: \"We're still in the early days of bitcoin adoption and so I'm quite bullish on what could happen to pricing when that manifests itself in the marketplace.'\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Bitcoin bulls were enjoying a nice ride last week. As of last Friday, 2023 was Bitcoin's best year since 2020 in terms of percentage gains, but we did see a bit of a reversal. Bitcoin erasing its week long rally after one of the worst crypto selloffs that we've seen this year. So with all this volatility in the crypto market, where are prices headed next? We want to bring in Greg Beard. He's Stronghold Digital Mining's CEO. Greg, it's great to see you.\n\nSo I think there's a lot of talk just about in terms of the pricing action that we've seen with Bitcoin, a number of headlines that have been driving some of this optimism as we look ahead to 2024. What do you think is the biggest driver of Bitcoin here over the next several months?\n\nGREG BEARD: Yeah. Everyone's been paying attention to the prospect of ETFs being approved by the SEC and the prospective demand that will be brought to the Bitcoin market with those ETFs hitting the street, which if Bitcoin trades about $20 billion a day worth of coins in ETFs themselves, could be tens of billions of dollars of additional demand. So I think that's the reason for the recent run-up in Bitcoin in our view.\n\n- Is the potential for ETF approvals even bigger than the halving that is set to come forward or anticipated next year?\n\nGREG BEARD: Yeah. So there's a lot talk about what the halving would do. And the halving really just reduces the amount of the mining reward for the Bitcoin miners that approve transactions on the network. And looking backward, that has been a big impetus for Bitcoin price to rise.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut as Bitcoin has gotten bigger over time, the mining rewards are less important. So I think I might have the minority view that the halving will have a big immediate impact on price. I think it's a much bigger impact on the demand from protective of ETF acceptance or from broader market use and acceptance as Bitcoin becomes more prevalent.\n\n- So Greg, when you talk about maybe broader use and acceptance, you talk about the fact that there is so much optimism surrounding the ETF approvals. How much of that optimism has already been priced in though when you take a look at the massive run-up that we have seen in Bitcoin?\n\nGREG BEARD: Yeah. I think certainly, some will be priced in. But those ETFs actually have to go out and buy the bitcoins. And so I think the demand, the prospect for demand might be in the market a bit. But keep in mind, they actually have to go do it. And they can't do it until they're approved and created."

        "content": "Bitcoin and ether still need to pump by about half to see their respective all-time highs. Not these cryptocurrencies.\n\nBittensor (TAO), the token that incentivizes competition between artificial intelligence models, hit highs over the weekend after launching in March.\n\nTAO has now more than tripled since its first trading day, converting to 900% gains from its lows posted in May.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s first-ever BRC-20 token (ORDI) also hit an all-time high last week. ORDI was minted to show that Ordinals can do (almost) everything that Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 tokens can, including trade at billion-dollar valuations despite having little utility beyond being a great meme.\n\nORDI is up more than 160% since it opened six months ago and 14 times higher than record lows posted only in September.\n\nRead more: Ethereum won\u2019t flip Bitcoin anytime soon, but Ordinals could change that\n\nThere\u2019s Kaspa (KAS), the native crypto for the layer-1 blockchain of the same name. Kaspa presents itself as a follower of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Monero, in that it\u2019s fully mineable without, purportedly, any central leader.\n\nKAS, which can be mined alongside Ethereum forks ethereum classic (ETC) and ethereum pow (ETHW), has multiplied by almost 600 times since its launch last May. It hit an all-time high three weeks ago and has so far retraced by one-fifth.\n\nBONK, the premier dog-themed cryptocurrency on Solana, recently flipped pepe (PEPE) to become the third-most valuable memecoin behind shiba inu (SHIB) and dogecoin (DOGE).\n\nBONK hit its highest point ever on Saturday \u2014 $0.00001464 \u2014 after rocketing 7,500% over the past two months.\n\nBONK is an outlier over the past month\n\nCrypto exchange tokens are even getting a run. Bitget (BGB), launched in 2020 and OKX\u2019s OKB, first traded in 2018, are up 170% over the past year and both set price records one month ago.\n\nUsers of those exchanges can spend the respective tokens on trading fees and initial coin offerings.\n\nRollbit (RLB), the native crypto for the popular exchange-slash-casino, also traded at its highest point ever in November. RLB has exploded 7,500% over the past year and was first issued in March 2022.\n\nAnother four cryptocurrencies in the top 100 or so hit their own highs over the past month, but they don\u2019t really count as they\u2019ve only been around less than six months.\n\nSEI, the token for the self-styled \u201cfastest layer-1\u201d of the same name, set a record last week after launching in August.\n\nTIA, for blockchain data network Celestia, also hit an all-time high last week after launching in October.\n\nPYTH, for the oracle network hoping to rival Chainlink, launched in late November and set a price record only four days later.\n\nJTO, the DAO governance token for liquid Solana staking protocol Jito, is just scaling back from highs set two days after its Dec. 7 airdrop.\n\n(A special mention for Solana rival injective (INJ), which launched in 2020 and floated around all-time high over the weekend but, unfortunately, didn\u2019t quite clear it this time around.)\n\n\u201cAltcoin season\u201d may seem well and truly here. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance \u2014 which measures how much of the crypto market is BTC \u2014 has hovered around 50% for the better part of the past six months and crypto bulls could look for that figure to shrink as a major rally is confirmed.\n\nAll these cryptocurrencies indeed set highs against the US dollar over the past month. But not all have hit price records against bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn those cases, it seems more likely that bitcoin\u2019s own price rally played a significant role in boosting their valuations. That could convert to outsized losses should bitcoin fail to maintain its recent gains for an extended period.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear, though, is these recent all-time highs in other cryptocurrencies have barely made a dent.\n\nNow, we all wait for bitcoin.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

This is effectively digital gold,\" the SkyBridge Capital founder said on Monday.

Supply-side factors will also drive the upside, especially with a bitcoin halving cycle scheduled for April.\n\nSince last week's gains, bitcoin has slid aggressively, with a steep slide in a matter of minutes Sunday evening erasing most of the gains over the prior week.\n\nGiven that bitcoin should be a long-term investment, Scaramucci also noted that it will help diversify portfolios and decrease correlation risk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If we're right, it will impact your portfolio positively, it will offer some lack of correlation to some of the other assets,\" Scaramucci said. \"If you look at monthly returns this year in bitcoin even when the S&P was not doing well, bitcoin did well. And it does have over time I think a decoupling effect to the stock and bond market.\""

        "content": "BlackRock Amends Bitcoin ETF Application, Easing Access for Wall Street Banks\n\nBlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has made revisions to its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application in a move aimed at facilitating the participation of Wall Street banks. The revised application allows banking giants like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to create new shares in the fund using cash instead of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis new redemption model, called \"prepay,\" enables authorized participants (APs) from major banks to bypass restrictions that prevent them from holding Bitcoin or crypto directly on their balance sheets. By transferring cash to a broker-dealer, which then converts it into Bitcoin, the APs can participate in the fund. Coinbase Custody serves as the ETF's custody provider in BlackRock's case.\n\nPresented to the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) by six BlackRock members and three from NASDAQ in a meeting on November 28, the revised model aims to address concerns such as market manipulation and enhance investor protections. BlackRock believes that the new structure offers superior resistance to market manipulation, a key factor that has previously led the SEC to reject spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nBlackRock recently had its third meeting with the SEC on December 11, led by Chairman Gary Gensler. The previous meeting on November 28 was a follow-up to the initial meeting on November 20, during which the original in-kind redemption model was presented.\n\nThe SEC is expected to make a decision on BlackRock's application by January 15, 2024.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price finally witnessed a significant 7% pullback on Dec. 11 as multiple indicators flashed sell signals and traders booked profits. Bitcoin\u2019s ability to hold above $42,000 will determine whether this crash is a buy-the-dip opportunity or a general market reversal.\n\nShort-term volatility or big trend reversal?\n\nThe sharp BTC price drop observed on the daily chart corresponds with a sudden 6.5% drawdown and over $300 million long liquidations across the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBTC/USD 4-hr candle chart. Source: Bitstamp\n\nZooming to the longer 1-day candle timeframe, however, this movement appears as a minor retracement in a more extensive bullish trend established over the past few months. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) has retreated into neutral territory below 70.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day candle chart. Source: Bitstamp\n\nLast week\u2019s analysis confirmed the strong uptrend that Bitcoin has been in, with significant momentum observed after the price breached the $40,000 mark.\n\nThis context suggests that the recent dip could be a short-term fluctuation within a continuing upward trend rather than a general trend reversal, though more downside or sideways actions should not be ruled out for the days ahead.\n\nKey BTC price levels to watch\n\nAs noted earlier, important levels to watch include $31,860, $28,050, and $25,200, which have been significant since 2021.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin dominance threatens \u2018likely top\u2019 despite BTC price eyeing $45K\n\nTherefore, the fact that the BTC price has not approached these levels and the recent uptrend has been strong enough to surpass minor resistance levels with ease supports the argument that the current price action is within the bounds of a healthy correction rather than a bearish trend reversal.\n\nHealthy corrections in a bull market\n\nCorrections are considered a normal part of every upward trend. They are typically seen as healthy for the market because they allow for consolidation and can shake out weak hands, as demonstrated by the volatility in mid-November.\n\nIf followed by a strong bounce, the current drop would indicate that the market is still in a positive trend and traders are buying the dip.\n\nHence, the latest price drop must be viewed in the context of the longer-term trend, and it seems more indicative of a temporary dip within a bullish phase rather than a complete trend reversal, at least so far.\n\nBTC price drawdown from all-time high. Source: Glassnode\n\nBut, one must also consider that previous Bitcoin bull markets have all seen pullbacks of well over 20%, as shown above by the long drawdown wicks during each bull market phase.\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin could still drop much further without halting the overall uptrend. However, its ability to hold above $42,000 will further strengthen the argument that this was just a short-term dip and sentiment remains overall bullish.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin\n\nAs excitement builds among investors that a much-anticipated first spot bitcoin ETF could launch early next year, firms are disclosing the tickers for their funds as they prepare for fierce marketing competition if the exchange-traded funds are approved.\n\nVanEck included the firm\u2019s meme reference ticker HODL in their most recent amendment filed Dec. 8 to the firm\u2019s S-1 filing, while Fidelity Investments\u2019 ticker, FBTC, appeared on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. website on Dec. 7.\n\nVanEck\u2019s ticker, HODL, is likely a nod to a popular cryptocurrency term often used to mean \u201cHold On For Dear Life.\u201d Eric Balchunas noted on X that HODL was differentiated from tickers from BlackRock Inc., Invesco and Fidelity as a \u201cdeparture from the more boring Boomer-y choices.\u201d BlackRock\u2019s proposed ticker is IBTC, and Invesco\u2019s is BTCO.\n\nWhile having a catchy or entertaining ticker could speak directly to crypto retail investors, it doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that investors would be won over by a pertinent reference or pun.\n\n\u201cIt's hard to say how much impact a ticker has on the demand for an ETF,\u201d said etf.com senior analyst Sumit Roy. \u201cA good ticker could make a fund more memorable (i.e. \"HACK\" for a cybersecurity ETF), but it only plays a tiny part in an ETF's success.\u201d\n\nMany ETFs with memorable tickers have also failed to gain traction. For example, Roundhill Investments recently announced it was shuttering its Roundhill MEME ETF (MEME) after the fund failed to gain traction with its targeted audience of retail traders.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Race\n\nFees, liquidity and brand recognition will be key factors that investors will use to differentiate funds, according to both fund issuers and analysts.\n\nIn an interview with etf.com in November, Cathie Wood, who operates spot bitcoin ETF hopeful issuer ARK Invest, said that if multiple spot bitcoin ETFs are launched at the same time, firms will jockey to win over both institutional and retail investors.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt's a marketing game from there, although some people would call it a war,\u201d Wood said.\n\nThat issuers are updating their tickers is also a sign that firms are in the final stages of amending their applications. The ETF issuers who have been in discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission have narrowed down the agency\u2019s concerns to a few key details, according to Reuters.\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "title": "3 Cryptocurrency Platforms That Could Outperform Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Amid the rally in the cryptocurrency market, now is the time to consider some cryptos that are better than Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Although BTC may never be usurped from its throne as the king of decentralized currencies, it may not be as flexible or robust as others in specific situations. Furthermore, diversifying one\u2019s portfolio with different coins may lead to stronger gains overall.\n\nSo, in this article, we\u2019ll discuss three cryptos that are better than Bitcoin. That way, you can unlock more value from your portfolio and expose yourself to different segments of the market.\n\nHere are three coins for you to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nConcept graphic of Ethereum Classic (ETC) crypto logo in green techno style\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/BT Side\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) wins over Bitcoin due to better ecosystem support and more efficient use of energy through proof-of-stake.\n\nWhile Bitcoin may be monolithic, Ethereum is comparatively more diverse due to the community\u2019s ability to host and scale decentralized applications on its platforms and allow investors to stake their Ethereum-based tokens for strong APY returns.\n\nWhat\u2019s better is that while the market is focused on a proposed Bitcoin ETF, there\u2019s also an Ether ETF proposal in the making. Companies like Fidelity National Financial (NYSE:FNF) have submitted applications for an ETF over the past few years, and more are expected to be lodged in the future. That would give retail investors and institutions direct exposure to ETH without owning the underlying, offloading custody risk and making it generally more accessible overall.\n\nThat makes ETH one of those cryptos that are better than Bitcoin.\n\nCardano (ADA-USD)\n\nA concept coin for Cardano (ADA). Cardano Price Predictions\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCardano (ADA-USD) stands out for its research-driven approach to blockchain development with its Ouroboros network. Although ADA also uses proof-of-work, its architecture is designed to be less energy-intensive than Bitcoin\u2019s.\n\nADA stands out as a pick because if history repeats itself as in previous rallies, altcoins should also rally along with Bitcoin and for a few weeks after the upcoming halving event. What gives ADA an advantage in this case is its market capitalization, which stands at an eighth position in Coinmarketcap\u2019s rankings.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince ADA\u2019s market cap is far smaller than Bitcoin\u2019s, and the total amount of coins in circulation for ADA is not far off Bitcoin\u2019s max supply, ADA could undergo a far stronger rally amid the halving event. Some analysts predict that it could increase by 2,800%.\n\nUnlike other altcoins that come and go, ADA has stood the test of time and is one of those tokens most investors would keep in their portfolios whether a massive rally takes place, finding the sweet spot between risk and reward. That puts it on the list of cryptos that are better than Bitcoin.\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nAbstract 3d rendered coin solana (SOL-USD)\n\nSource: solvertv / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) is my risky contrarian play to ride out the halving event and for a long-term hold. SOL is known for its exceptionally high throughput and low transaction costs via its unique proof-of-history consensus mechanism combined with proof-of-stake.\n\nUnfortunately, SOL took an enormous reputational hit amid the FTX exchange collapsing in 2022. At one point, it had lost 94.2% of its value. Most of the damage came from Sam Bankman-Fried praising the token despite a lack of direct exposure to FTX and Alameda Research.\n\nSOL could be undervalued and oversold. Its all-time high was $260, but it currently trades for around $69.56 at the time of writing. It then has a lot of room to surge higher to make up for the ground it lost in the FTX fiasco.\n\nThen, on a fundamental level, some analysts have posited that SOL could further benefit from the rise of meme coins in its ecosystems. These coins are wildly speculative as they usually have no utility or real intrinsic value besides what someone is willing to pay. Due to their fundamentals, they could rise the most out of all ecosystem tokens.\n\nSome of the hottest meme coins, like Bonk (BONK-USD), are based on SOL, so owning the underlying may give investors good exposure to a solid network as well as potentially explosive gains moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "This Bitcoin Investment Could Give Crypto Investors a Double-Win - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency markets have been volatile in recent years, with the crypto winter crushing Bitcoin (BTC -5.65%) and many of its digital asset peers in 2022. However, Bitcoin has bounced back with a vengeance, and crypto investors are now pouring back into the market to take advantage of what they hope will be a sustained rebound in prices in the sector.\n\nPart of what's fueling speculation about a long-term rise for Bitcoin is the prospect for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve an exchange-traded fund that owns Bitcoin directly. Such a fund could have advantages over the current futures-based ETFs that are currently available.\n\nBut there's actually a fund that exists currently that owns spot Bitcoin. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC -5.76%) has been around for years, and although it hasn't gotten regulatory approval from the SEC to be a true ETF, investors are increasingly optimistic that it could do so in the near future. If that happens, then early investors could actually get an unexpected double win.\n\nThe origins of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\n\nGrayscale originally created its Bitcoin trust to give investors a way to participate directly in the price changes of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust offered shares to institutional and accredited investors without having to do a full registration process with the SEC. Grayscale then took that money and purchased Bitcoin with it. Each share, therefore, represented a fraction of a Bitcoin.\n\nTo be clear, though, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was not set up like an ETF. Fund shareholders have no right to redeem their shares for actual Bitcoin. Even institutional investors lack the ability to buy and sell new shares on the open market in the same manner as ETF shares. In many ways, the trust more closely resembled a closed-end fund with a set number of shares -- particularly when Bitcoin prices tumbled and interest in cryptocurrency waned.\n\nFrom premium to discount...\n\nIt's that locked-in aspect of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust that was so damaging to shareholders when crypto winter set in. At the beginning of 2021, demand for Bitcoin was so strong that investors were willing to pay 25% more for trust shares than the value of the proportional amount of Bitcoin each share represented. That was with Bitcoin at about $30,000, and the cryptocurrency would double to more than $60,000 within the first couple months of the year.\n\nBy the end of 2022, however, Bitcoin prices had sunk to $17,000. Even worse, Grayscale shares traded at a nearly 50% discount to the value of the underlying Bitcoin. As a result, shareholders suffered losses of almost 75% during that two-year stretch -- far worse even than the roughly 50% haircut the cryptocurrency itself experienced.\n\n... and back again?\n\nIn 2023, however, the opposite has happened. Improving Bitcoin prices have led more investors to purchase Grayscale trust shares, in turn narrowing the discount. As of Dec. 7, trust shares traded at just 12% below the value of the fund's underlying Bitcoin holdings. The total return for Grayscale shareholders so far in 2023 has been over 300% -- crushing even the 165% gains in Bitcoin itself year to date.\n\nIf Grayscale Bitcoin Trust succeeds in getting approval as a true ETF, moreover, there would likely be immediate gains for shareholders. An SEC-approved ETF would have provisions that would provide a mechanism for redemptions. The ability to use arbitrage would in turn make the remaining discount largely disappear.\n\nWith just a 12% discount remaining, the potential double-win for Bitcoin investors in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust isn't nearly as large as it once was. Yet those who are bullish on the cryptocurrency market generally might enjoy the possibility of getting a modest sweetener on top of their Bitcoin returns."

        "content": "El Salvador\u2019s ambitious plan to issue $1 billion in sovereign \u201cVolcano Bonds\u201d backed by Bitcoin has cleared a significant obstacle, bringing the pioneering offering closer to fruition, according to a recent Coindesk report. The country\u2019s nascent Digital Assets Commission (CNAD) has granted regulatory approval for the bonds issued in early 2024 through Bitfinex Securities.\n\nThe approval represents a watershed moment for the experimental bonds first unveiled by President Nayib Bukele in 2021 following his government\u2019s historic adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender. Enshrined in legislation passed by a vast parliamentary majority, the bonds are intended to allow El Salvador to tap financial markets to build a geothermal-powered Bitcoin mining ecosystem.\n\nInitially slated for issuance in 2022, complications surrounding El Salvador\u2019s negotiations with the IMF and designing a unique regulatory framework for the asset-backed offering delayed the bonds. Receiving the green light from CNAD, established in 2021 to govern El Salvador\u2019s crypto industry, is seen as an affirmation that the country has managed to construct a robust architecture for crypto financial innovation.\n\nEl Salvador is positioning itself at the bleeding edge of digital asset adoption.\n\nPositioning itself at the bleeding edge of digital asset adoption, El Salvador is moving forward with the bonds despite Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility and the collapse of FTX demonstrating crypto\u2019s risks. The Bukele administration views pioneering government adoption as a differentiator that enhances El Salvador\u2019s investment attractiveness.\n\nIf successfully executed, the value of the bonds will be hedged to price stability while offering an attractive 6.5% coupon paid out in US dollars. The underlying bitcoin will be held in a transparent public wallet open to scrutiny, with El Salvador legally bound to redeem the bonds in traditional currency.\n\nThe issuance still faces challenges, like drumming up $1 billion in investment for an unproven crypto instrument issued by a developing economy. However, by clearing regulatory barriers, the Volcano Bonds have taken a major leap toward introducing the globe\u2019s inaugural Bitcoin-backed sovereign debt.\n\nFeatured Image: Pexels"

        "title": "Are These Bitcoin's 2 Biggest Risks? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "One of the best-performing assets recently has been Bitcoin (BTC -5.97%). This top digital asset has seen its price skyrocket despite gut-wrenching volatility.\n\nAfter a bear market rattled cryptocurrencies in 2022, it's been a bounce-back year in 2023. As of the afternoon of Dec. 8, Bitcoin is up 160% year to date. The optimism surrounding the world's most valuable crypto is high right now.\n\nBut while it's easy to be bullish, Bitcoin HODLers must always be aware of the downside, as this is still a very early-stage technology with an uncertain future. Along the same vein, here are what I view as Bitcoin's two biggest risks.\n\n1. Government ban\n\nThe most obvious risk is that governments worldwide could ban Bitcoin, making it illegal to own or mine. This has happened in China, the world's second-largest economy.\n\nFor a completely digital asset like Bitcoin, a ban is more difficult to implement and enforce than physical gold, for example. But regulatory authorities can shut down centralized on-ramps into Bitcoin, like Coinbase or Block, making it that much harder to buy or sell.\n\nThe fear is that a major developed economy, like the U.S., in particular, will move to ban Bitcoin in some form or fashion. That's because Bitcoin, as a decentralized monetary network, threatens the entire existence of the Federal Reserve. A government's power is derived from its ability to control the money supply and tax its citizens. If Bitcoin gains in adoption, it could undermine this entire system.\n\nBut if the U.S. bans Bitcoin, I think people would be more inclined to want to own it because that would be an admission that it is something of value. Moreover, as a global asset, Bitcoin activity will just shift to a more friendly jurisdiction.\n\nTo be clear, it's becoming less likely that the U.S. will go this route. For starters, there's a risk of falling behind other countries when it comes to Bitcoin-related innovation. As more of the wealthy class starts to own Bitcoin, especially politicians and those who donate to political parties, the chance Bitcoin gets banned diminishes.\n\n2. Quantum computing\n\nAt a high level, Bitcoin is basically just a massive database that keeps track of a history of transactions. The beauty of the network is that it is operated by a global and decentralized group of tens of thousands of computers, all running Bitcoin's software. Not having a central point of failure helps make the system antifragile.\n\nBut there could be a potential risk factor regarding Bitcoin's security: quantum computing. This is, essentially, an extremely powerful computer that can solve complex problems more rapidly than the strongest machines that exist today.\n\nIf these types of computers become cheaper to build in larger quantities, a bad actor could crack Bitcoin's cryptography, exposing everyone's private keys. And whoever does this would then be able to spend all this Bitcoin. At that point, no one would trust the network, likely causing Bitcoin's price to fall to $0.\n\nIt's hard to tell when we could see quantum computers go mainstream, but I believe the worries for Bitcoin are overblown. Developers aren't sitting around idle. They could come together to introduce technological updates to strengthen the network over time.\n\nAnd think of all the other mission-critical information that could be exposed by quantum computers besides Bitcoin. Financial information and even military secrets could be revealed. This could have far worse ramifications for society.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that Bitcoin's network has never been hacked. The stories you've likely heard comprise of exchanges experiencing a data breach or something similar. Nonetheless, this proves that protecting data in an increasingly digital world is absolutely crucial. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, the number of cyberattacks has nearly doubled from 878 in 2020 to 1,595 in 2022.\n\nEven the strongest Bitcoin bulls shouldn't ignore these two major risk factors."

        "content": "Things are still looking up for bitcoin despite an eye-popping drop in its price at the beginning of this week, according to Fairlead Strategies. Bitcoin fell 7% Monday as traders took profits from a two-month rally now at 54%, according to Coin Metrics. The selling took place days after bitcoin surpassed the $40,000 level, rising above $44,000 quickly for the first time since April 2022. On Tuesday, it was trading at about $41,000. That could just be a blip in the chart, however. \"It has yet to impact our short-term trend-following gauges, which point higher,\" Katie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies founder and managing partner, said in a chart update Tuesday. She also said momentum in the intermediate term remains \"strongly positive,\" which suggests overbought conditions \"can be sustained without a major pullback in the weeks ahead.\" The drop began Sunday evening and at its lowest, pulled bitcoin down to $40,300, according to Coinbase. It'd have to fall even further, however, to warrant more concern by investors. Stockton said she's watching bitcoin's 50-day moving average, roughly $37,400, as the initial support level. Other chart analysts put it at $38,000 . The next level down is near $31,000, but Stockton said that's \"unlikely to be relevant near term.\" When prices reach new highs, Fairlead typically looks for them to sustain the new level for two weeks. The firm is looking to see if bitcoin can close this Sunday above $42,200 to confirm its recent breakout. That would make the next level higher to watch at about $48,600, which would be a 61.8% retracement, Stockton said in the note. Fairlead currently has a long-term neutral outlook on bitcoin. If the crypto can clear $42,700 for the month, that would support a shift to a long-term bullish bias, Stockton said. The key drivers that have been pushing crypto prices higher since the summer are still in place: primarily, the highly anticipated bitcoin exchange-traded fund, as well as the upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected in the spring. Bitcoin may be the blue chip coin of the crypto market, but it's still a high risk bet compared to more traditional assets. Volatility is a key characteristic of the asset class, and pullbacks of as much as 10% are somewhat expected among more seasoned investors when bitcoin has big rallies. Bitcoin is currently up 9% in December, not a particularly strong month for bitcoin historically. It has gained 150% in 2023."

        "content": "Bitcoin BTC -6.23% saw a second day of decline despite major equities posting an uptick after U.S. data showed November's inflation reading to be in line with expectations.\n\nThe world's largest digital asset by market capitalization slumped lower, down over 1.3% to trade at $41,283 at 10:40 a.m. ET. That came in contrast to early trading on Wall Street that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise 0.2%, the S&P 500 gain 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite increase 0.1%.\n\nCPI rises 3.1% in November, as expected\n\nTuesday's inflation reading by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that prices across a broad range of U.S. goods and services edged higher in November but were mostly in line with expectations.\n\nThe reading could be encouraging investor anticipation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady at its policy meeting on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the BLS, the consumer price index increased 0.1% in November and was up 3.1% from a year ago. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI increased 0.3% on the month and 4% from a year ago. Both numbers were in line with estimates and little changed from October. However, the figures are still far above the Fed's 2% inflation target.\n\nPossibility of continued Fed rate pause\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nAccording to YouHodler Chief of Markets Ruslan Lienkha, the market is expecting another rate pause at tomorrow's Federal Open Market Committee. \"Such a decision will mean that everything is following Powell's plan toward a soft landing, but at the same time, the chairman's rhetoric may adjust market expectations, and may provoke a temporary correction,\" Lienkha told The Block.\n\nAccording to analysts at Bitfinex, the effect of a continued rate pause will not be limited to traditional markets but will extend to the cryptocurrency sector. \"Cryptocurrencies have previously experienced positive market movements following decisions by the Fed to keep interest rates steady. This trend is attributable to the perception of lower or steady interest rates leading to increased disposable income for investments, fostering an optimistic investment environment,\" Bitfinex analysts told The Block\n\nInflation is still 'entrenched'\n\nHowever, one analyst believes U.S. inflation is becoming \u201centrenched\u201d and predicts the Federal Reserve will have a battle on its hands in 2024 and may still hike rates one more time.\n\n\"With services sector inflation now entrenched, and the labor market continuing to run incredibly hot, we expect to see inflation spike to 3.5% in December, which could lead to another rate hike from the Federal Reserve in 2024,\" Truflation Head of Product Oliver Rust said in a note sent to The Block.\n\nThe CME FedWatch tool has set the probability of a rate pause at tomorrow's FOMC meeting at 98.5%."

        "title": "One-hour Bitcoin block times: What do they mean, and are they frequent? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A Bitcoin (BTC) block that took over an hour to mine made headlines earlier in November. This is despite Bitcoin\u2019s core protocol being written to aim to mine a block every 10 minutes.\n\nBlock 815,690 is the latest outlier to generate press speculation. This block took one hour and nine minutes to mine on Nov. 7. Public interest in an hour-plus confirmation time is not a singular event. Roughly once or twice a year, a media outlet picks up on a long block validation event and decides to run with the story.\n\nOn Oct. 17, 2022, a prominent crypto news site reported on a block that took one hour and 25 minutes to mine, which spurred a flurry of similar reports. As the story spread widely on social media, some fans reveled in the relative speed of their favored centralized altcoin.\n\nThe report eventually caught the attention of Lighting Network founder Tadge Dryja, who was decidedly unimpressed.\n\nAs Dryja pointed out on X (formerly Twitter): \u201cA time between blocks of 85 minutes happens every 34 days or so (assuming no difficulty changes, etc).\u201d\n\nDryja\u2019s point was clear: A single long block alone is no cause for alarm. Given the regularity of longer blocks, Dryja questioned whether the article would be a new monthly feature for the publication.\n\nProbability is tricky\n\nWhile almost everyone who knows about Bitcoin understands that the coin\u2019s proof-of-work consensus mechanism is a puzzle of computational guesswork, the math that underpins this knowledge is infinitely harder to understand.\n\nThe probability of an hour-long block occurring is relatively low, and it is also higher than humans intuitively expect. Most of the time, longer blocks go unnoticed, at least by the press.\n\nThis might help to explain why longer blocks become a talking point whenever someone stumbles across them.\n\nRecent: Bitcoin\u2019s many deaths: Is crypto market past \u2018point of no return?\u2019\n\nIn February 2021, a crypto community member on X, Bitcoin Jack, noticed that one hour and 46 minutes passed between blocks 670,637 and 670,638. That\u2019s just one block confirmed where 10 or 11 would typically be expected.\n\nJack tagged cypherpunk and Bitcoin advocate Jameson Lopp to ask how common such occurrences were. Lopp confirmed that 190 blocks had taken 106 minutes or more to mine in the previous 12 years. It\u2019s worth remembering, however, that in its earliest years, Bitcoin blocks more regularly took longer to mine, which skews the figures slightly.\n\nVery unusual blocks\n\nHour-long plus blocks are more commonplace than most Bitcoiners might guess, but some blocks are more extreme.\n\nOne such block came immediately after Satoshi Nakamoto mined the Genesis Block on Jan. 3, 2009. That block is probably the most famous in Bitcoin\u2019s history. Learning its inscription \u201c03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\u201d is practically a Bitcoin right of passage.\n\nThe next block in Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is far less known but no less fascinating. The second block wasn\u2019t mined until six days later, on Jan. 9. Bitcoin fans have speculated on its meaning \u2014 or whether it means anything at all.\n\nSome theorists even claim the six-day waiting period is a Biblical allegory \u2014 let there be Bitcoin. Whatever the truth, the time interval between these two blocks remains the longest in Bitcoin\u2019s history.\n\nOn the flip side, there are blocks with roughly the same timestamp as their predecessors, while others have timestamps that predate their forebearers. Of course, timestamps are not always accurate, especially since human hands can adjust the clocks on Bitcoin miners.\n\nAccording to timestamp codes, Bitcoin block 156,113 was mined On Dec. 5 at 8:16 am. Those same codes reveal that Bitcoin block 156,114 was mined on Dec. 5 at 6:17 am \u2014 one hour 59 minutes earlier.\n\nThat would be a neat trick if accurate, but the likely cause of these time-related shenanigans is a miscalibrated clock on the mining equipment.\n\nBitcoin: A self-righting machine\n\nUnderstanding block times is tricky because it relies on probability, but other factors complicate matters further. For one thing, the number of miners on the network is in constant flux.\n\nTo ensure the 10-minute average is maintained, Bitcoin mining difficulty can be adjusted every 2,016 blocks. If the average is too high, then difficulty is lowered; if it is too low, difficulty is increased.\n\nWhen Lopp investigated Bitcoin block times in 2021, he concluded that \u201cBy analyzing the actual distribution of block times we can see that the math behind the targeted block time of 10 minutes has held up quite well over the past 12 years and the few edge case aberrations can be easily explained.\u201d\n\nIn the last five years, for every month barring one, the mean block interval on the Bitcoin blockchain landed within a minute of its target. In three out of the last five years, the yearly average landed within 10 seconds of the 10-minute target.\n\nBy these metrics, the Bitcoin network is becoming more stable and reliable over time.\n\nThe single \u201cedge case\u201d in this period occurred in June 2021. At the tail end of May 2021, China banned Bitcoin mining. The result was a drastic fall in the network\u2019s computational power mining blocks. In June, the Bitcoin mean block time hit 732 seconds \u2014 over two minutes longer than the target period \u2014 as the network dealt with the knock-on effects.\n\nMagazine: Lawmakers\u2019 fear and doubt drives proposed crypto regulations in US\n\nIt took until Dec. 2021 for the network hash rate to recover to previous levels, but thanks to the difficulty adjustment, the 10-minute window was reestablished in July.\n\nIn Nov. 2018, during the depths of crypto winter, average block times rose to 670 seconds. This occurred as miners switched off older, less efficient mining equipment that was no longer profitable in the face of reduced Bitcoin prices.\n\nIn both of these instances, the network self-corrected the following month. As far as longer blocks are concerned, the Bitcoin network is a battle-tested self-righting machine."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to trade below its 2023 high, a sign that investors may have underestimated the strength of the $44,000 resistance. Even as BTC price trades below $42,000, it doesn't necessarily mean that reaching $50,000 and beyond is no longer possible. In fact, quite the opposite seems more likely to occur. Looking at Bitcoin derivatives metrics, it is clear that traders ignored the 6.9% drop and remained optimistic. However, is this optimism enough to justify further gains?\n\nThe $127 million liquidation of leveraged long Bitcoin futures on Dec. 11 may seem significant in absolute terms, but it represents less than 1% of the total open interest \u2013 the value of all outstanding contracts. Nevertheless, it's undeniable that the liquidation engine triggered a 7% correction in less than 20 minutes.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s crash was accelerated by derivatives, at least in the short-term\n\nOn one hand, one could argue that derivatives markets played a crucial role in the recent negative price movement. However, this analysis overlooks the fact that after hitting a low of $40,200 on Dec. 11, Bitcoin's price increased by 4.2% in the following six trading hours. In essence, the impact of forceful liquidation orders had dissipated long ago, disproving the notion of a crash solely driven by futures markets.\n\nTo determine if Bitcoin whales and market makers are still bullish, traders should examine Bitcoin futures premium, also known as the basis rate. Professional traders prefer monthly contracts due to their fixed funding rate. In neutral markets, these instruments trade at a premium of 5% to 10% to account for their extended settlement period.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch\n\nData reveals that the BTC futures premium barely fluctuated despite the 9% intraday price drop on Dec. 11, as it remained above the 10% neutral-to-bullish threshold throughout. If there had been significant excess demand for shorts, the metric would have at least dropped into the neutral 5% to 10% range.\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to gauge whether the recent correction has dampened investor optimism. The 25% delta skew is a telling indicator when arbitrage desks and market makers charge excessively for upside or downside protection.\n\nIf traders expect a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and periods of excitement tend to result in a negative 7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs shown above, the BTC options skew has been neutral since Dec. 5, indicating a balanced cost for both call (buy) and put (sell) options. It's not as optimistic as the prior couple of weeks when put options traded at a 10% discount, but it at least shows resilience after the 6.1% correction since Dec. 10.\n\nRetail traders remained neutral-to-bullish despite Bitcoin\u2019s fluctuations\n\nAfter covering two of the most relevant indicators for institutional flow, one should analyze whether retail traders using leverage influenced the price action. Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, include an embedded rate that is typically recalculated every eight hours.\n\nBitcoin perpetual futures 8-hour funding rate. Source: Coinglass\n\nA positive funding rate indicates increased demand for leverage among long positions. Notice that data reveals a modest increase between Dec. 8 and Dec. 10 to 0.045%, equivalent to 0.9% per week, which is neither significant nor burdensome for most traders to maintain their positions.\n\nRelated: El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin bond gets regulatory approval, targets Q1 launch\n\nSuch data is quite healthy, considering that Bitcoin's price has surged by 52% since October. It suggests that excessive retail leverage longs didn't drive the rally and subsequent liquidations.\n\nWhatever caused the rally to $44,700 and its subsequent correction to the current $41,300 appears to be primarily driven by the spot market. This doesn't necessarily mean that the bottom is in, but it significantly reduces the odds of cascading liquidations due to excessive optimism tied to the expectation of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval.\n\nIn essence, this is good news for Bitcoin bulls, as derivatives indicate that positive momentum hasn't faded despite the price correction.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, has long been under scrutiny for its environmental impact due to the energy-intensive nature of its mining process.\n\nSince its inception in 2008, Bitcoin has never been hacked. Its tight security, provided by its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, provides value to the cryptocurrency.\n\nPoW, however, is energy-intensive and relies on complex cryptographic algorithms requiring vast computational power.\n\nThe global popularity of Bitcoin (BTC) has resulted in its network energy consumption sitting at 147.61 terawatt-hours per year as of Dec. 7, close to the yearly average energy consumption of countries such as Poland, Ukraine and Malaysia, according to the University of Cambridge.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s PoW consensus mechanism has become an immutable security guarantee, but some see it as an environmental nightmare.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin mining industry increasingly shifts to renewable energy sources to address these concerns, new studies now point toward another ecological problem: the high water consumption of crypto mining.\n\nBitcoin mining\u2019s growing thirst for water\n\nA recent study titled \u201cBitcoin\u2019s growing water footprint,\u201d authored by Alex de Vries \u2014 a data analyst and researcher at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) \u2014 found that Bitcoin\u2019s water consumption has the potential to harm the environment.\n\nThe Bitcoin mining industry has grown yearly and continues to reach new all-time high hash rates. This trend is set to continue as the price of BTC surges.\n\nAs with any computer, cooling is essential for mining devices to work optimally.\n\nBitcoin mining rigs have hundreds of machines that reach very high temperatures as they try to solve the complex mathematical challenges PoW presents.\n\nWater is often used for cooling systems and air humidification systems. Additionally, water may be indirectly used to generate electricity.\n\nAs the study states, \u201cThe water footprint of Bitcoin in 2021 significantly increased by 166% compared with 2020.\u201d\n\nDe Vries admits the challenge of quantifying the direct water footprint due to limited public information. However, with the retrieved data combining direct and indirect water consumption, he estimates that the total annual water footprint for United States Bitcoin miners could range from 93 to 120 gigalitres (GL), equivalent to the average annual water consumption of around 300,000 U.S. households.\n\nMagazine: Lawmakers\u2019 fear and doubt drives proposed crypto regulations in US\n\nFurthermore, Riot Platforms, one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world, is constructing a new mining facility in Texas, which will raise the total water footprint to 121.2\u2013147.8 GL, as per de Vries.\n\nBased on all the collected data, de Vries told the BBC that every Bitcoin transaction uses, on average, enough water to fill a backyard swimming pool. As he outlines in his study:\n\n\u201cWith the network handling 113 million transactions in 2020 and 96.7 million in 2021, the water footprint per transaction processed on the Bitcoin blockchain for those years amounted to 5,231 and 16,279 L, respectively.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, de Vries told the BBC that an estimated 6 million times as much water is consumed with each Bitcoin transaction than is used in a typical credit card swipe. The statement was based upon data from another recent report titled \u201cThe water and carbon footprint of cryptocurrencies and conventional currencies.\u201d Per his calculations, conventional cashless transactions consume about 2.6 milliliters of water.\n\nDe Vries further introduces a controversial solution for the heavy resource consumption of Bitcoin: changing its validation protocol from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake (PoS).\n\nEthereum recently made this crucial change, reducing its energy demand by 99%. But with it came an unavoidable expense: centralization. One of Bitcoin\u2019s core existential values is to remain decentralized and independent of any dominating party.\n\nIs the cost per transaction really accurate?\n\nFor ClimateTech investor Daniel Batten, this study is biased, as de Vries is an employee of the DNB, the Dutch Central Bank. As Batten stated on X (formerly Twitter):\n\nWhy the @BBCNews article on Bitcoin and Water is a monument to journalistic lazinesshttps://t.co/BRGRXzAeBW\n\n\n\nThe day after the Independent publish the results of a high quality independent study on Bitcoin, the BBC publish the junk-science of a known anti-Bitcoin lobbyist using\u2026 \u2014 Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) November 29, 2023\n\nBatten opposes de Vries\u2019 solution of switching Bitcoin to PoS, telling Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s energy usage has the potential to be a positive environmental externality on its own merits, because that energy use is predominantly sustainable, highly flexible, incentivizing renewable development (backed up by research and quantified now), using curtailed and stranded energy that others cannot, stabilizing the intermittency of renewable power on grids and, most importantly, allowing us to mitigate methane. PoS-based blockchains have none of these potential use cases.\u201d\n\nBatten also pointed out that Cambridge University has previously argued that criticizing Bitcoin based on the supposed energy cost per transaction is not entirely accurate, as \u201ctransaction throughput (i.e., the number of transactions that the system can process) is independent of the network\u2019s electricity consumption. Adding more mining equipment and thus increasing electricity consumption will have no impact on the number of processed transactions.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, one transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain could include hundreds of payments or \u201c\u200b\u200brepresent billions of timestamped data points using open protocols.\u201d\n\nHe contended that measuring the water use per transaction could therefore be similarly misleading.\n\nDe Vries told Cointelegraph that the indicator is simply \u201can efficiency metric that captures the average water use per transaction processed on the Bitcoin blockchain for the years 2020 and 2021.\u201d\n\nBatten also claimed that no recent studies about Bitcoin\u2019s usage of renewable energy or similar positive aspects of crypto mining were considered in de Vries\u2019 reports.\n\nBitcoin mining can help nations with water scarcity\n\nIt is undeniable that Bitcoin mining requires a high amount of energy. Any industrial process that consumes energy will result in water consumption. However, unlike many other industries, Bitcoin mining is location-agnostic. Therefore, Bitcoin miners can operate virtually anywhere where electricity and the internet are available.\n\nBatten demonstrates in his blog how Bitcoin mining could, in theory, actually help countries facing water scarcity, noting it is estimated that almost 20 countries will suffer from high or extremely high water scarcity by 2040.\n\nThe Middle East and North Africa are among the driest locations on earth. In this region, the situation is extreme, with a constant decline in rainfall in the last 30 years, which has resulted in nations using more water than they receive.\n\nAs David Hannah, a professor of hydrology at the University of Birmingham, told CNBC, the Middle East \u201chas very limited conventional water resources, and some of the groundwater resources are saline.\u201d\n\nThese countries have begun to use desalination, but making potable water through this process is expensive and energy-intensive.\n\nNaturally, the Middle East is the region most reliant on desalination. The industry is critical for residents\u2019 survival, so countries such as the United Arab Emirates have made ambitious plans to power these desalination plants. The UAE is in the process of constructing one of the most extensive solar infrastructures in the world, aiming for a capacity of 5 gigawatts by 2030.\n\nConsidering this information, how could Bitcoin mining benefit countries with water scarcity that require desalination? Batten builds his argument on two points.\n\nFirstly, Bitcoin miners could accelerate the buildout of renewable power for desalination. Any electricity provider will encounter the issue of excess capacity. The overproduced energy cannot be stored easily, so it becomes wasted if no consumers or buyers are available.\n\nRenewable energies such as solar power create virtually infinite electricity but do so irregularly. Additionally, the ideal location for producing energy may be isolated from its consumers.\n\nBitcoin miners are the perfect fit, as they are potential buyers of excess solar-powered electricity. This fact may accelerate the setup of new solar energy capacity, as developers can rest assured they have potential buyers to rely on before launching the project. Consequently, Bitcoin mining can help transition to renewable-powered desalination, and the UAE could meet its water security goals without endangering its emission-reduction goals.\n\nSecondly, Bitcoin mining may increase the efficiency of the operational production of desalination. Efficiency gains in operating costs mean water can be desalinated close to the operating cost.\n\nBoth technologies can complement each other. Heat is used directly for desalination, and almost 100% of the energy used by Bitcoin mining rigs is transformed into heat.\n\nRecent: One-hour Bitcoin block times: What do they mean and are they frequent?\n\nThe emanated heat energy can be used directly for desalination, but with the caveat of earning revenue from Bitcoin mining. In conclusion, there is an improvement in the water-per-dollar ratio, resulting in more water desalinated for the same net cost.\n\nOverall, a point critics of Bitcoin mining tend to miss is the potential adoption by the renewable energy industry.\n\nBitcoin: To be or not to be\n\nBitcoin has long had a negative public image regarding its environmental impact. One way to promote its benefits and usability is to present empirical facts demonstrating that crypto mining can utilize all energy created and result in favorable economics.\n\nAccording to Batten, the Bitcoin mining narrative is already starting to shift. For him, \u201cthe higher use of sustainable energy, better data visibility and quality independent reporting, and publications such as the KPMG and IRM [Institute of Risk Management] reports and the ACS Sustainability Journal \u2014 authored by a decorated scientist who is highly regarded in his field \u2014 showing how Bitcoin mining \u2018supercharges\u2019 the renewable transition\u201d could be a catalyst for this new era for Bitcoin\u2019s public image.\n\nThe dilemma is whether Bitcoin or a decentralized digital currency is considered a valuable tool for global society. If not, then Bitcoin\u2019s mining energy is a complete waste. If yes, then its energy usage is a necessary investment for a future with a currency for the people."

This implies that Bitcoin holds a relatively higher value compared to stablecoins, indicating that market participants attribute greater value to Bitcoin, which has been a driving factor in Bitcoin\u2019s price increase,\u201d contributing analyst Woo Minkyu wrote in one of CryptoQuant\u2019s Quicktake market updates on Dec. 9.\n\n\u201cHowever, historically, some investors have shown a preference for converting Bitcoin into stablecoins, suggesting that there might be a short-term price correction in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBitcoin stablecoin supply ratio (SSR) annotated chart.

The Lookintobitcoin golden ratio multiplier indicator, which explores Bitcoin\u2019s adoption curve and market cycles, shows that the 1.6 multiplier target has now been reached around the $44,000 area.

According to the chart below, the BTC exchange flow balance now stands at -347.\n\nBitcoin exchange flow. Source: Santiment\n\nThe negative reading shows BTC outflows eclipsing inflows, suggesting that investors are more inclined to hold than sell, which is a bullish sign.\n\nThis suggests that the latest dip toward $40,000 could be a short-term correction giving traders an opportunity to buy more on the dip before continuing the upward trend.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Bitcoin traded above all the major moving averages, which maintained their upward trajectory. Notably, these chart overlay indicators presented areas of strong support on the downside.\n\nThe moving average convergence divergence indicator (MACD) was still moving above the neutral line in the positive region. The MACD line (blue) was still positioned above the signal line (orange) after crossing above it on Oct. 16, suggesting that the market conditions still favored the upside.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart: Source: TradingView\n\nTherefore, BTC\u2019s price will likely continue to rise from the current levels, with buyers targeting a break above $44,000.

        "content": "The Bitcoin (BTC) price recorded a sharp correction on Dec. 11, dipping 7% and wiping out the gains of the past seven days. The strong price correction pushed BTC to a four-month low of $41,329.\n\nA decline in prices of altcoins followed the Bitcoin price correction, many of which recorded double-digit drops. However, market pundits and analysts believe the recent price crash is a part of the ongoing price cycle, and after two months of bullish surge, a correction is no surprise.\n\nCrypto analyst and co-founder of Reflexivity Research Will Clemente said that correction and market volatility shake out weak hands and cool the highly leveraged crypto markets.\n\nBTC just ~doubled in 2 months with no pull backs, a correction is not that surprising.\n\n\n\nCorrections shake out \u201cweak hands\u201d and leverage, allowing for a stronger foundation for eventual moves higher.\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s volatility is a feature, not a bug.\n\n\n\nChill with the leverage https://t.co/BdvvS8KDZU \u2014 Will (@WClementeIII) December 11, 2023\n\nCrypto trader Remen wrote in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he believes the recent dump could push altcoins into another bull run.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nOver $400 million worth of positions liquidated in the last 24 hours across BTC and ETH.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum decreased by 11% as key resistance was reached.\n\nA Bull market correction might have started.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin reached $45,000 on December 5 and stayed there until yesterday, December 10, when it made a downturn. It fell to $40,335 at its lowest point as the week began, marking a decrease of 11%. On the other hand, Ethereum made its yearly high of $2,400 on December 9 after a downturn to $2,145, which is an 11% decrease as well.\n\nConsequently, we saw a larger amount of long positions getting liquidated. According to CoinGlass data, in the past 24 hours, 113,881 traders were liquidated, and the total liquidations came in at $403.96 million.\n\nMost were long positions with $348.62 million compared to only $55.52 million. With the prices getting overextended in the previous period and now seeing significant declines, is this an early sign of market weakness?\n\nBTC Price Analysis\n\nThe price of Bitcoin rose by 76% since its September 11 low of around $25,000. This is the start of the ending wave from the larger uptrend that started on November 21 last year.\n\nIn our previous analysis, we called for an interaction with the $45,000 area as the next significant resistance, and judging by today\u2019s rejection, it has proven to serve as such. Analyzing the wave structure in the last advancement from November 6, it seems there might be another minor attempt to continue its upward trajectory.\n\nIt came slightly short from the interaction with the level, so an upward spike above it would look likely, but it ended as a wick and quickly snapped back below it. The rise ended as it is, and now the first bull phase correction has started.\n\nIn any case, this correction will be awaited shortly, and from the current downward movement, we will see if it has already begun. This ABC correction should bring the price of Bitcoin to the $25,000 area optimally but could go lower.\n\nETH Price Analysis\n\nWhat\u2019s been said for Bitcoin applies to Ethereum as well. Its price was in an ascending structure from June 18 last year and most likely marked the completion of the leading diagonal, moving upward in a five-wave manner.\n\nDecember 9 high was an interaction with its ascending resistance level and ended as a rejection, displaying the same behavior as it did on two previous occasions. There could be another minor high ahead, but this chance is slim.\n\nMore likely, we saw the completion of this larger uptrend, and it is now headed to its first bull-significant correction. If so, ETH could now be sent to the $1,500 area in an ABC correction or to $1,400 if it reaches its optimal Fibonacci retracement level of 0.618.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has continuously grown since November last year and recovered significantly, showing promising signs of a starting bull market. However, before it can continue sustainably, it must establish higher support and form its first higher low.\n\nThese higher lows are the corrections we have outlined in our price chart analysis and are referred to as higher price points compared to the lows of November last year when the larger uptrend started.\n\nAs the prices are getting overextended and we are approaching the holiday season, the euphoria might cause the market to continue or attempt to rise for another push, but these corrections are imminent.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "Update (Dec. 13, 12:05am): This article has been changed to reflect clarification from Luke Dashjr, who says he had requested Bitcoin inscriptions be given a CVE number, but did not have a part in it being added to the NVD.\n\nBitcoin inscriptions have received a 5.3 medium base severity score from the National Vulnerability Database \u2014 a repository of cybersecurity risks managed by the United States government.\n\nBitcoin inscriptions first appeared on the U.S. vulnerability database as part of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Assignment list on Dec. 9, which claimed it was a security flaw that enabled the development of the Ordinals protocol in 2022.\n\nOn Dec. 11, the NVD updated the listing by assigning inscriptions a base severity score of \u201c5.3 Medium.\u201d\n\nThe CVE List has assigned a 5.3 Medium score to the Inscriptions listing. Source: NVD\n\nAccording to data from software firm Atlassian, a medium score refers to a vulnerability where exploitation provides \u201cvery limited\u201d access to a network or denial of service attacks that are quite difficult to execute.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr said that a major factor in the NVD's 5.3 score was due to the vulnerability having a low availability impact on the Bitcoin network. Still, he argued the score could be understating its potential long-term effects.\n\n\u201cI think this [score] may understate the impact, failing to consider the long-term effects of blockchain bloat. If they had classified the availability impact as \u2018High,\u2019 the CVSS base score would be 7.5.\"\n\nWhile Dashjr has denied any part in getting Bitcoin inscriptions on the NVD, he admits he had initially requested the CVE number, which saw it added to the CVE list.\n\nNotably, the CVE list is designed so any developer can submit a potential vulnerability. It is typically listed as long as the CVE Assignment Team deems it important for public awareness. Once it receives a score from analysts at the National Institute of Standards and Technology it is then published on the NVD.\n\nDashjr courted controversy in a Dec. 6 post to X (formerly Twitter) claiming that inscriptions \u2014 used by the Ordinals protocol and BRC-20 creators to embed data on satoshis \u2014 exploit a Bitcoin Core vulnerability to \u201cspam the blockchain.\u201d\n\nPSA: \u201cInscriptions\u201d are exploiting a vulnerability in #Bitcoin Core to spam the blockchain.

By obfuscating their data as program code,\u2026 \u2014 Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) December 6, 2023\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals could be stopped if blockchain bug is patched, claims dev\n\nThe debate around the nature of Bitcoin inscriptions continues to rage across social media. While many Bitcoiners claim that inscriptions are \u201cspamming the network,\u201d advocates of Ordinals such as Taproot Wizards co-founder Udi Wertheimer say Ordinals are crucial to the next major wave of adoption and revenue generation for the Bitcoin network.\n\nordinals are a bug pic.twitter.com/vU0CXgD9wY \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) December 12, 2023\n\nThe Bitcoin network has seen increased congestion over the past few months due to a wider craze around Ordinals\u2019 nonfungible token inscriptions and BRC-20 token minting.\n\nAccording to mempool.space, there are more than 275,000 unconfirmed transactions, and average medium-priority transaction costs have increased to around $14 from roughly $1.50. If the so-called inscriptions bug is patched, it could potentially restrict future Ordinals inscriptions on the network.\n\nMagazine: Lawmakers\u2019 fear and doubt drives proposed crypto regulations in US"

This is after the market already saw $330 million in crypto futures contracts liquidated on Monday morning as BTC fell below $43,000. Total liquidations have now reached $516 million, according to CoinGlass.\n\nStill, the 1-day dip is relative. It's still 5% higher than it was at the start of the month, when BTC was changing hands for $38,688. The same can be said of Ethereum, which has lost 7% since yesterday and is currently trading for $2,185. That's 7% higher than what it started the month at, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization, which has hovered around $1 trillion for the better part of the year, now sits at $1.6 trillion\u2014down 6% since yesterday.\n\nElsewhere in the market, alts were taking a beating.

Exchange-traded products meant to track the two coins saw $5 million worth of deposits last week. And while most of the gaming token category went red on Monday, Immutable (IMX) saw a 10% gain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Binance USD (BUSD)\u2014a dollar-pegged stablecoin\u2014lost its peg for a while on Monday. As of this writing, BUSD had dropped as low as $0.97, according to CoinGecko. Even though it's a defunct stablecoin, there are still roughly 1.4 billion of the tokens in circulation.\n\nOne possible reason for the price turbulence: Most BUSD margin trading and futures contracts were automatically closed today, according to a Binance blog post.\n\nBUSD has been on a steady decline since the SEC sent a Wells Notice to New York-based firm Paxos, which used to handle minting and redemptions of BUSD on behalf of crypto exchange Binance. In the aftermath, Paxos and Binance said that users could continue to redeem their tokens until February 2024.\n\nThe exchange said BUSD tokens that aren't redeemed before Binance stops support will automatically be converted to FDUSD, a stablecoin issued by FD121 Ltd.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "title": "Bitcoin vs gold: Which one is a better investment option? - The Economic Times",
        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the universe of investments, the age-old debate between investing in traditional assets and emerging digital alternatives has gained momentum especially when discussing which one is preferred.The landscape of investments over the last few decades has witnessed a transformative shift with the rise of digital currencies, and among them, Bitcoin stands out as a beacon of innovation and opportunity.Among the contenders, Bitcoin has emerged as a frontrunner, challenging the historical dominance and status quo of gold as the ultimate store of value.One of the key reasons investors are drawn to both gold and Bitcoin is their finite supply. Gold's scarcity has been the primary driving factor behind its historical value, but Bitcoin takes this concept to the next level.Built on a protocol that caps its supply at 21 million coins, Bitcoin introduces an unyielding element of scarcity that outshines gold. Operating on a decentralized network, Bitcoin is free from the influence of any government or central authority. This decentralization ensures that no single entity can manipulate the currency , making it a more robust store of value when compared to gold, which is subject to geopolitical and economic pressures.In today\u2019s age of digitalization, the physical constraints of investing in physical gold especially when it comes to transporting and dividing gold make it complicated and expensive, limiting its utility for day-to-day transactions.Bitcoin, being entirely digital, transcends these limitations allowing for seamless, instantaneous transactions across borders, making it a more practical and efficient medium of exchange. Moreover, Bitcoin's divisibility into smaller units, known as satoshis, enhances its usability for microtransactions, a feat unattainable with physical gold. Also, the underlying blockchain technology offers a level of transparency that gold transactions lack.Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on a public ledger, accessible to anyone interested. This transparency reduces the risk of fraud and ensures the integrity of the entire network. Furthermore, the security features embedded in Bitcoin's cryptographic framework make it highly resistant to hacking and fraud, providing investors with a robust layer of protection that physical gold may lack.It is also important to remember that Bitcoin provides financial inclusion to individuals who may not have access to the traditional banking systems or the ability or the financial wherewithal to purchase gold. However, with a smartphone and an internet connection, anyone can participate in the Bitcoin network, fostering a more inclusive global financial system.To extract value from both gold and Bitcoin, a form of \u2018mining\u2019 is involved. When it comes to Gold, a tangible and physical asset extracted from the earth, its enduring appeal makes it a sought-after commodity for both jewellery and investment. Investing in the metal makes it a reliable asset for hedging against inflation and diversifying investment portfolios.However, the actual mining of gold for investment purposes is resource-intensive, requiring substantial energy and water consumption. This contributes to the industry's carbon footprint and raises concerns about sustainability.Bitcoin on the other hand is a digital asset that has introduced a new form of mining of cryptographic tokens. Operating on a decentralized network, the process of mining Bitcoin contributes to the security and integrity of the blockchain. This decentralized nature eliminates the need for central authorities, providing a level playing field for participants, allowing individuals from various corners of the world to participate.This inclusivity promotes financial accessibility, especially in regions with limited access to traditional banking systems. Despite all the inherent advantages, mining of Bitcoin also poses significant challenges.Bitcoin mining, particularly Proof of Work (PoW) methods, has faced criticism for its energy-intensive nature where large scale mining farms, often powered by fossil fuels, contribute to environmental concerns and carbon emissions. This process also requires specialized hardware and technical expertise, thereby creating barriers to entry for individuals without the necessary resources or technical know-how.Gold mining and Bitcoin mining represent two distinct approaches to resource extraction, each with its own set of advantages and challenges. While gold carries the weight of history, stability, and tangible appeal, Bitcoin introduces decentralization, global accessibility, and limited supply to the mining landscape.Investing in gold often requires substantial capital, and the costs associated with storage and insurance can be extremely discouraging to investors.Bitcoin, on the other hand, is more accessible to a broader spectrum of investors. Its divisibility allows for fractional ownership, enabling individuals to start with smaller amounts and gradually increase their holdings.Moreover, Bitcoin provides financial inclusion and goes a long way in bridging gaps in the global financial landscape. With a smartphone and an internet connection, anyone can participate in the Bitcoin network, democratizing finance in ways gold never could.In the clash between Bitcoin and gold, it's no longer merely a debate over two assets but a reflection of the ongoing transformation in the world of finance.The ongoing saga of investment choices has seen Bitcoin emerge as a revolutionary force, challenging the conventional wisdom that has surrounded gold for centuries. Its combination of finite supply, decentralization, digital efficiency, transparency, and global accessibility positions it as a compelling alternative for the modern investor. As we navigate through an increasingly interconnected and digitized world, the attributes that set Bitcoin apart\u2014scarcity, decentralization, and digital efficiency\u2014signal a paradigm shift in how we perceive and store value.However, it is advised that like with any investment decision, investors need to be discerning, do their due diligence before coming to a decision of investing in either Bitcoin or gold. With the passage of time as the digital revolution unfolds, the choice between Bitcoin and gold becomes not just a financial decision but a strategic positioning in the evolving landscape of global wealth.(The author Roshan Aslam is Co-founder and CEO of GoSats.

        "content": "Bitcoin [BTC] fell early Monday, validating the caution signaled by the options market last week.\n\nThe 4% drop to $42,000 has cooled the overheated crypto perpetual futures market, clearing the way for a steady ascent into the year-end.\n\nPerpetuals are futures with no expiry with a funding rate mechanism that helps tether perpetual prices to the index price. Funding rates are periodic payments of an asset between long (buy) and short (sell) position holders calculated and collected by exchanges every eight hours. A positive funding rate means the perpetual contract is trading at a premium to the spot prices; longs are dominant and are paying shorts to keep their positions open. A negative rate suggests otherwise.\n\nA high funding rate, typically greater than 0.10% (for eight hours), is taken to represent excess bullish leverage or overcrowding of long positions.\n\nAccording to data source Velo Data, funding rates for BTC, ETH and other major cryptocurrencies consistently tapped the 0.15% mark in the second half of last week, signifying an overheated leveraged market.\n\nThe situation has normalized with the early Asian session market-wide price drop, leaving funding rates for most coins in a healthy territory below 0.1%.\n\nIt's a sign overleveraged traders have been shaken out of the market. Funding rates or costs associated with leverage become a burden when the momentum stalls, forcing overleveraged traders to exit and causing a minor bullish/bearish hiccup.\n\nThe market-wide decline in the notional open interest, or the dollar value locked in open crypto futures contracts, suggests the same. As of writing, XLM, UNI, LINK and XMR showed a double-digit slide in open interest for the past 24 hours.\n\nOpen interest in bitcoin and ether was down 1.3% and 6.7%, respectively.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Coindesk"

Discover SCENE\n\nThe price of Bitcoin slumped below $43,000 in the early hours of Monday morning, all but erasing the last week's gains and causing almost $390 million in liquidations across the crypto futures market in the past 24 hours.\n\nAt time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at around $42,400, down 3% in the past 24 hours\u2014having dipped as low as $41,800 in the past day, per data from CoinGecko.\n\nOf the nearly $402 million in liquidated crypto positions over the past day, just over $345 million were long positions\u2014with over $260 million in the past hour, according to data from CoinGlass. Over 109,000 traders were liquidated over the past 24 hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf the total liquidations in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin saw over $103 million in liquidations, of which $89 million were long positions.\n\nBitcoin's overnight slump puts a bump in the road of the past week's crypto market rally, with the global crypto market cap of all cryptocurrencies dropping by 3.1% over the past 24 hours, to $1.65 trillion.\n\nBitcoin's stumble means that the past week's gains have been slashed to just 1.8%, however, the cryptocurrency is still up over 14% in the past month and 13% in the past fortnight, and a whopping 146% over the past year.\n\nThat uptrend has been fuelled by optimism over the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has held a number of meetings with applicants in recent weeks.\n\nIn the wider market, there's also a growing expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2024; Goldman Sachs revised its projection on Monday morning to two such cuts in 2024, with the first expected in Q3.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice."

        "content": "In November, the cybersecurity collective vx-underground wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that unknown hackers were claiming to have breached Coin Cloud, a bankrupt Bitcoin ATM company.\n\nAccording to vx-underground, the hackers claimed to have stolen 70,000 pictures of customers taken from cameras embedded in the ATMs, as well as the personal data of 300,000 customers, which is alleged to include, \u201cSocial Security Numbers, date of birth, First Name, Last Name, e-mail address, Telephone Number, Current Occupation, Physical Address, and more.\u201d\n\nNobody has claimed the hack publicly. A month on, what really happened to Coin Cloud remains a mystery, even according to the company\u2019s new owner.\n\nCoin Cloud was a company that maintained thousands of Bitcoin ATMs across the U.S. and Brazil, according to its official website, until the company filed for bankruptcy in February. In July, Genesis Coin, another Bitcoin ATM provider, acquired 5,700 ATMs from the since-defunct Coin Cloud, according to a press release published at the time. Genesis Coin was itself acquired earlier in January by Andrew Barnard and an associate, who owned another cryptocurrency ATM company called Bitstop.\n\nContact Us Do you have more information about the Coin Cloud hack? We\u2019d love to hear from you. You can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or email lorenzo@techcrunch.com. You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop.\n\nBarnard, who serves as the CEO of Bitcoin ATM, the re-branded company after the purchase of some Coin Cloud assets in the bankruptcy proceedings, told TechCrunch that his company launched an investigation after the vx-underground tweet, but it couldn\u2019t conclude when the breach happened or who was responsible, and he himself described the incident as \u201ca mystery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe data breach happened a while ago as Coin Cloud has been hacked multiple times in the past when they were still an operating company,\u201d said Barnard. \u201cI believe that data is just now being ransomed. It\u2019s impossible to say [when] as there were little controls throughout the software development process and multiple international contractors had access to source code that contained secrets within it to access the [database],\u201d Barnard said in an email.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like the services which Coin Cloud kept alive were recently breached from what we were shown,\u201d added Barnard. \u201cTherefore it\u2019s reasonable to assume this is data that has already been stolen from one of the previous times Coin Cloud was hacked. It\u2019s an assumption, but a reasonable one. It\u2019s impossible to really say when the data was compromised or who did it. So many vendors and internal employees had access to it that it could have happened at many different times over the years.\u201d\n\nBarnard said that if someone obtained the source code, which contained the admin credentials to the database, the hackers \u201cwould have access to all the [Know Your Customer] information of customers.\u201d\n\nKnow Your Customer, or KYC, are checks carried out by tech and financial companies for verifying a person\u2019s identity to prevent fraud and money laundering. KYC checks often rely on customers submitting scans of their identity documents.\n\nA former Coin Cloud employee, who asked to remain anonymous, told TechCrunch that Coin Cloud was \u201can absolute disaster to work for.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a security team,\u201d the former employee said, adding that she believes Coin Cloud got hacked at least once last year, and that the company stored a lot of data in plaintext, meaning it wasn\u2019t encrypted."

        "content": "Bitcoin price started a sharp decline after trading close to $45,000. BTC is down over 8% but the bulls seem to be active above $40,000.\n\nBitcoin is showing a few bearish signs from the $44,699 high.\n\nThe price is trading below $43,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.\n\nThere was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $43,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).\n\nThe pair could find strong buying interest near the $40,000 zone.\n\nBitcoin Price Drops Heavily\n\nBitcoin price remained in a bullish zone after it broke the $40,000 resistance. BTC climbed higher steadily above the $42,000 and $43,000 levels. The price even rallied above $44,000.\n\nHowever, it failed to test the $45,000 resistance. A high was formed near $44,699 and the price started a sharp downside correction. There was a move below the $44,000 level. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $43,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\n\nThe pair declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $39,398 swing low to the $44,699 high. Bitcoin is now trading below $43,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.\n\nHowever, the bulls are protecting the $40,000 support and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $39,398 swing low to the $44,699 high. The price is attempting a recovery wave and facing resistance near the $42,400 level.\n\nSource: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe first major resistance is forming near $43,2000, above which the price might gain bullish momentum and rise toward $44,000. A close above the $44,000 resistance might start a strong upward move. The next key resistance could be near $44,200, above which BTC could rise toward the $45,000 level.\n\n$40K Is The Key For BTC\n\nIf Bitcoin fails to rise above the $43,200 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $41,200 level.\n\nThe next major support is near $40,500, below which the price might test the $40,000 zone. If there is a move below $40,000, there is a risk of more downsides. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $38,500 support in the near term.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 30 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $41,200, followed by $40,000.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $42,400, $43,200, and $44,200.\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "BITCOIN, CRYPTO KEY POINTS:\n\nBitcoin Remains Above the 40k Mark Which Remains Key for Further Downside.\n\nCrypto Industry Resilience on Display with Latest Research Piece Reveals 83% of Crypto Mentions are Positive.\n\nOver $300 Million in Long Positions Liquidated Following Todays Slump in Prices .\n\nTo Learn More About Price Action , Chart Patterns and Moving Averages ,Check out the DailyFX Education Series.\n\nREAD MORE: EURO Weekly Forecast: ECB Expected to Hold Rates but How Will Projections Differ from Market Expectations?\n\nRecommended by Zain Vawda Get Your Free Introduction To Cryptocurrency Trading Get My Guide\n\nBitcoin (BTC/USD) Sank as much as 7.5% overnight to a low of around $40520, which is just a whisker away from the psychological $40000 level. I had discussed the possibility of this potential pullback last week in my article (to read click here). There does not appear to be any singular driving force behind the move except perhaps the slightly stronger US Dollar. I however think that this is in part down to profit taking ahead of the Risk Events this week and the end of year holidays.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nWILL THE $40K LEVEL SUPPORT HOLD?\n\nThe $40 k mark could hold the key heading into the festive break. A break below this level could open up the potential of a deeper retracement down toward the $31k-$32k area. As mentioned above I believe that part of the move is likely down to profit taking as we do have a bunch of risk events ahead. The move down may be welcomed by many, particularly institutions who may want to get involved before the Spot ETF decisions early in 2024. The question is how deep a retracement will we get and will the FOMC meeting play a part?\n\nAccording to CoinGlass data shows that there was an approximate liquidation of around $335 million of long positions over the last 12 hours. The amount of liquidations are represented below with Bitcoin leading the way followed by Ether.\n\nSource: CoinGlass/CoinDesk\n\nCRYPTO RESILIENCE\n\nA pullback should not be viewed in a negative light as the overall cloud which many though would hover over the Crypto sector cleared long ago. This is something I have previously discussed but has actually been pointed out in research of late as well. According to research released recently by Coinwire.com, 83% of Crypto mentions in op publications have been positive in 2023. This would explain the resilience of the industry in a time when it has faced a number of challenges.\n\nOther key takeaways from the CoinWire study revealed that over 65% of global crypt related Tweets have a positive sentiment. The United Kingdom takes the lead in this global cheer, with more than72%of crypto-related tweets from this region being positive. The US as well is a leader here with approximately 2 out of 3 Americans have a positive view of Crypto in 2023. This is one I admit surprised me given the FTX scandal, but I was once again forced to remember the Banking crisis earlier in the year.\n\nI guess the point m trying to make here is a selloff should not be accompanied by doom and gloom and do not get caught up in the FOMO of it all with the festive season ahead. The outlook for 2024 looks promising and I would keep that in mind if we do have a deep and aggressive pullback.\n\nTrade Smarter - Sign up for the DailyFX Newsletter Receive timely and compelling market commentary from the DailyFX team Subscribe to Newsletter\n\nCATHY WOOD\u2019S ARK INVEST SELLS COINBASE SHARES\n\nARK has been consistently selling Coinbase (COIN) shares over the past couple of weeks. ARK upped the ante in July selling 480,000 shares at a value of $50.5 million at the time until this past Friday when ARK offloaded a further 335,860 shares which would have been valued at $49.2 million at Coinbase\u2019s closing price. A surprise to me given the positive outlook I have regarding Coinbase in 2024, but that\u2019s a topic for another time.\n\nARK however did the sale due to the target weighting it applies to its ETFs. The recent rally in the Coinbase share price has seen the weight of the shares exceed the limit of 10% imposed by ARK. The sale however failed to accomplish this, as things stand COIN accounts for some 13% of the Fintech Innovation ETF and +-11% of the Next Generation ETF. A further appreciation in the Coinbase price could see ARK effect further sales in the coming days and weeks and could be worth monitoring.\n\nREAD MORE: HOW TO USE TWITTER FOR TRADERS\n\nBITCOIN PRICE OUTLOOK AND FINAL THOUGHTS\n\nFrom a technical standpoint BTCUSD failure to find acceptance above $45k was a sign that retest of the $40k level was inevitable. We have just fallen short of this level today but could still go on to tap that level, where the 20-day MA also rests just above the $40k mark.\n\nThe support level at the $40k mark with a break lower brings support at the $37600 into focus with the 50-day MA resting at the $37400 mark. Any further drop will bring the support areas at 35600 and 35000 into play.\n\nA move higher from here will face immediate resistance at the $43000 handle before the psychological $45000 mark comes back into focus. The major resistance level at the $50000 mark looks tasty and achievable but there is a growing chance of a deeper retracement before a test of this level comes to fruition.\n\nSource: Kobeissi Letter\n\nResistance levels:\n\n43000\n\n45000\n\n47500\n\nSupport levels:\n\n40000\n\n37500\n\n35000\n\nBTCUSD Daily Chart, December 11, 2023.\n\nSource: TradingView, chart prepared by Zain Vawda\n\nRecommended by Zain Vawda The Fundamentals of Trend Trading Get My Guide\n\n--- Written by Zain Vawda for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow Zain on Twitter: @zvawda"

        "title": "The Mechanics and Rationale Behind Bitcoin Mixer - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Anonymizing transactions is extremely important nowadays. There are a huge number of ways to steal funds through deanon users. Despite the fact that cryptocurrencies provide a fairly high level of privacy, they cannot provide it completely. Bitcoin mixers eliminate the shortcomings of blockchains, making it possible to completely maintain anonymity in the transaction network.\n\nBlockchain Anonymity Is Exaggerated\n\nBlockchain was created as a confidential means of payment that has no restrictions. Bitcoin was the first to do this. No personal data is required, and transactions can be carried out worldwide, without increasing international transfer fees.\n\nDespite all its advantages, bitcoins have a significant drawback. It is pseudo-anonymous. What does this mean?\n\nThere is really no need to use personal data in the blockchain. It is enough to have public and private keys and coins directly to conduct a transaction. However, the blockchain itself provides a lot of indirect information that can be used to identify the names of the participants in the operation.\n\nKeep Reading Navigating US Oil Price Trends\n\nThe problem is that each transaction, despite passing through many nodes, records the addresses of the sender and recipient, the amount of coins, and the so-called UTXO. The last two points are of interest directly to the participants, as they give an understanding of the amounts that are stored in wallets.\n\nAs a result, attackers use a variety of software, tools and services to identify owners who are interested in their wallets.\n\nTherefore, it is extremely important to cut your connection with the transaction. Bitcoin mixers come to the rescue for this. They are services that use mixing and obfuscation technologies during operations. It is enough to conduct a transaction through them to ensure complete anonymity.\n\nHow Does a Bitcoin Mixer Work?\n\nTo understand how a Bitcoin mixer works, you need to understand how a transaction occurs. Operations in the blockchain are recorded in blocks along with data on them. Each block includes several transactions, which, when mined, are recognized as valid and reach the recipient.\n\nIt is impossible to change or falsify transactions, since they are stored in the blockchain chronologically. When a transaction occurs, it is entered into the blockchain registry - a kind of ledger. Just like in accounting, you can easily determine where these coins were before and who they belonged to.\n\nA special feature of Bitcoin is its identification. Each BTC has its own unique number. Therefore, tracking by address is not difficult.\n\nThe transactions themselves display a range of data. Add to this the digital footprint that absolutely everyone leaves on the Internet and even on the blockchain. Together, they make it possible to track the owner of the wallet right up to his real residential address.\n\nThe Bitcoin mixer breaks the transaction, replacing both part and absolutely all of the data in the operation, depending on the security level selected by the user.\n\nFirst of all, the service replaces the coins received from the address. After all, it is through them that it is easiest to track further movement. To do this, the coins are first split into satoshis, mixed with other such parts and new coins are generated.\n\nAfter the service action depends on the functionality selected by the user. The mixer can send them directly to the specified address or use additional options that the user has chosen:\n\n1. Time delay. Coins will be sent after a set interval. Its variability depends on the service itself.\n\n2. Splitting the amount into several parts. The mixer sends coins in batches from several crypto addresses.\n\n3. Sending to several addresses. The point is that the mixer also splits the sum into several parts. However, it already sends it to the addresses specified by users. As a rule, there are no more than five of them.\n\nThese functions can be combined. This makes it simply impossible to track the transaction. In addition, a good mixer uses data encryption methods. It does not require user registration, but issues special codes. When using the latter, the mixer ensures that your coins that you sent before will not reach you again.\n\nAre All Bitcoin Mixers Reliable?\n\nAs in any other industry, there are good and reliable service providers, and there are scammers or underqualified ones. This also applies to Bitcoin mixers. The risks of use are extremely high if you are not careful when choosing a service.\n\nA Bitcoin mixer aims to break the connection between the sender and the recipient in a transaction. However, if he has a database of his clients, which displays who sent funds and where, then the whole point of using them is lost.\n\nFraudsters easily sell this data to third parties, which then leads to the theft of cryptocurrencies from wallets. If the service is not qualified enough, then it is simply not able to provide the level of privacy protection that is necessary. It's enough to hack to get the information you need.\n\nTherefore, it is extremely important to approach the choice of Bitcoin mixer with caution.\n\nHow to Choose a Bitcoin Mixer\n\nFrom all of the above, you can already guess about the main accents that are worth paying attention to. Nonetheless, a more detailed list of parameters to consider when selecting a Bitcoin mixer is provided below:\n\n1. Anonymity. If a service asks you to register to gain access to functionality, avoid it. There is no absolute protection, therefore, any hack will cause your de-anonymization. Not to mention the fact that such services have a database of users, which they can transfer to third parties.\n\n2. Zero logs policy. The bottom line is that your transaction data and connection with the Bitcoin mixer must be completely deleted. Otherwise, there will be the same risks as in the previous paragraph.\n\n3. Security level. All data that connects you with the mixer must be encrypted at the highest level. This will hide your digital traces. There should also be no storage of cookies to improve the user experience.\n\n4. Functionality. The service should provide you with the necessary functionality so that you can completely anonymize your transaction. In this case, these functions must be performed with high accuracy.\n\n5. Commissions. Of course, no one wants to overpay. However, there should be variability here, since a fixed fee is a clear sign of using a mixer. Too low commissions with a large selection of functions should be alarming. This is a sign that the owners of the service make money somewhere else, for example, by selling user databases.\n\nIn addition, the mixer should be easy to use and offer various benefits. For example, have an affiliate program or discounts on services. There are services that not only provide this, but also provide special protection through a number of innovative technologies. Thanks to this, the user can receive discounts, but not have a direct connection with the mixer itself.\n\nHow is this ensured? The user is given a special encrypted code. It hides all data from third parties. At the same time, the service itself deciphers the code, receiving the necessary information.\n\nIs It Legal to Use a Bitcoin Mixer?\n\nMany people associate Bitcoin mixers with money laundering and illegal activities. In reality, this is a completely erroneous opinion. Chainalysis, a research service, annually analyzes the use of mixers, and it's important to note that the overall volume of such transactions through mixers remains relatively small. This highlights that the majority of mixer users employ them for legitimate purposes, aiming to enhance the privacy and security of their transactions.\n\nThere is currently no law that would prohibit the use of Bitcoin mixers to conduct transactions and maintain anonymity in the blockchain. The Constitution of all countries states that every person has the right to privacy. Therefore, maintaining anonymity on the Internet and blockchain is also such a right.\n\nBitcoin mixers, generally considered legal in many places, can be used responsibly to enhance transaction privacy. It's always good to be aware of your local laws, but for the most part, you can use these tools confidently to secure your crypto activities.\n\nAdditional Protection\n\nTurning on a VPN while using Bitcoin mixers can add an extra layer of security to the process. It changes your device's IP address, eliminating one of the most significant types of digital footprint. When visiting different sites, the device leaves data about its IP address. It is assigned to each PC or smartphone by the provider for identification on the network.\n\nTherefore, it is extremely important to hide it from prying eyes. The IP address leaves a significant trace on the network, making it possible to determine a user's actions.\n\nA VPN allows you to change the IP address, essentially pointing to a completely different location of the device. For example, you are in London, and the VPN shows that your location is now in Tokyo. For the entire digital world, this is where you will be, as the IP address will correspond to this region.\n\nConsistently using a VPN can be beneficial for enhancing online security. At the same time, avoid free versions or cheap services. They can introduce malware onto your device and sell databases. VPN payments should also be made in cryptocurrency. This will help maintain your anonymity online.\n\nTop Bitcoin Mixers\n\nThe following is a curated selection of the best Bitcoin mixers known for their high-quality services. This list can save time for those who prefer a ready reference. However, do not forget to analyze it yourself to be sure that the service is exactly right for you.\n\n1. Tumbler.io\n\nA young service, Tumbler.io, thanks to its unique technologies, is poised to become the best next year. First of all, it is worth noting that no data is saved here. First of all, it is worth noting that Tumbler.io saves no data. The service supports the No-Log policies. Tumbler.io provides effective mixing through the use of a Tumbler code and temporary freezing of 'new coins'\n\nAdditionally, Tumbler.io's Tumbler code is fully encrypted and updated after each use. It works like this:\n\n1. You do the mixing and you are given a code.\n\n2. When reapplying, use this code to avoid receiving your own coins from the previous mixing.\n\n3. At the same time, the user is given a new code\n\nThe point is that with each new request the code changes. The service does not store a database of these codes, as all information is directly encrypted within the Tumbler code. In this way, the service ensures that the connection is broken, since after mixing, all data is deleted. When you enter the code, the system will decipher the amount of the deposit and discounts, which are also included in the code itself. All this is stored by the user, which eliminates the possibility of leaking the database on this issue.\n\nTumbler.io's encryption system employs innovative technology, including RSA encryption. It allows you to encrypt all critical traffic that could be used to track the user. It also prevents the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nA few more features:\n\n\u2022 Unique mixing algorithms. Not only the usual mixing is used, but also a hybrid of CoinJoin technology.\n\n\u2022 The developers took into account all Blockchair heuristics to ensure maximum confidentiality.\n\n\u2022 Full protection from ddosguard.net and other analytical services.\n\n\u2022 Transaction details are deleted within 24 hours of mixing.\n\n\u2022 Deposit addresses are permanently deleted to prevent the mixer from being compromised.\n\n\u2022 A letter of guarantee is provided to fulfill obligations. At the same time, it is encrypted using cryptography methods.\n\n\u2022 Wide variability of commissions. The minimum is only 0.4% + network commission.\n\n\u2022 The service reserve is 500 BTC.\n\n\u2022 Minimum sending from 0.0001 BTC.\n\nAt the same time, it offers a wide range of functionality, starting from three levels of protection. Here you can specify up to 10 addresses to receive payments. The delay in dispatch ranges from an hour to three days. You can distribute funds by interest. At the same time, an interactive calculator is provided that will accurately calculate the size of the deposit and payments.\n\nThe best Bitcoin mixer Tumbler.io is actively present on Bitcointalk and has its own thread. Provides a user-friendly and responsive website on Clearnet. It is possible to use Tor using a separate link.\n\nThere is a detailed FAQ where the user can get the maximum amount of information.\n\n2. Yomix\n\nA young service that was launched this year. However, it has already achieved fame and popularity. Here you can quickly mix coins and use a variety of functionality for anonymity. The service does not save user logs after services are provided.\n\nA version without Javascript is available on the site. The minimum amount for mixing is 0.001 BTC, and the maximum is unlimited. Various address formats are supported: Legacy, SegWit, P2SH and Native SegWit. The commission ranges from 0.7% to 5%, to which a network fee is added. There is also a thread on Bitcointalk. There are plans to expand the capabilities by adding other cryptocurrencies besides BTC.\n\n3. Coinomize\n\nThis service stands out for its cost-effectiveness among its peers: the commission ranges from 1% to 5% plus 0.0003 BTC. The minimum amount for mixing is 0.003 BTC. Only one confirmation is required to transfer funds. It is possible to set a time delay for mixing, which increases the level of privacy.\n\nBy selecting multiple receive addresses, each will have a random time delay, avoiding the possibility of tracking mixer usage. The service enjoys an excellent reputation online due to its high quality of work, user-friendly interface and prompt transactions.\n\n4. UniJoin\n\nThe service uses CoinJoin technology to mix funds. Currently only supports Bitcoin, but plans to expand capabilities to include Ethereum, Litecoin and USDT in the future. Absolutely does not store any logs or data about transactions performed.\n\nService features:\n\n\u2022 Commission varies from 1 to 3%, additional network commission is charged.\n\n\u2022 The minimum amount for transactions varies depending on conditions.\n\n\u2022 There is absolutely no need to create an account to use the mixer.\n\n5. Blindmixer\n\nThis Bitcoin wallet is designed to mix transactions while providing complete privacy thanks to the use of Schnorr circuit technology. Its uniqueness lies in its status as the most private mixing service on the market. However, to use this function, you must create a wallet on this platform.\n\nImportant aspects:\n\n\u2022 Instantly exchange assets with other users without waiting for network confirmations.\n\n\u2022 The wallet works on the principle of custodial storage, which requires trust in Blindmixer to store funds. All users' cryptocurrency funds are stored offline.\n\n\u2022 The user has the ability to retrieve his seed phrase at any time.\n\n\u2022 The minimum amount for transactions is 100 satoshi.\n\n\u2022 There are no commissions for mixing amounts from 0.01 BTC; for smaller amounts the commission is 100 satoshi.\n\nHowever, Blindmixer has a significant drawback: it is possible to get back some of your own coins due to the nature of the mixing process. All coins are \"blinded\" and it becomes impossible to determine who owned which of them. If this situation does not suit you, consider other services.\n\n6. CryptoMixer\n\nBitcoin mixing service CryptoMixer is a platform aimed at serving the needs of its community and strives to gain the trust of a large number of users.\n\nPlatform features:\n\n\u2022 Use of unique mixing algorithms.\n\n\u2022 Providing the ability to mix large amounts thanks to the presence of a reserve of 2000 BTC.\n\n\u2022 Low commissions and discount system.\n\n\u2022 24/7 technical support.\n\n\u2022 Personalized settings for the percentage of funds distribution and delays in the execution of operations.\n\n\u2022 Affiliate program availability.\n\n\u2022 Ability to reuse input and output bitcoin addresses.\n\n\u2022 Active presence on Bitcointalk.\n\n\u2022 Commission: 0.5% + 0.0005 BTC.\n\n\u2022 Minimum amount: 0.001 BTC.\n\n\u2022 Support for mobile devices.\n\nThis platform is one of the most popular Bitcoin mixers. Has a lot of positive reviews.\n\n7. MixTum\n\nMixTum.io, created in 2018, is a Bitcoin mixer that is unique due to its integration with the Jambler.io platform. Unlike typical BTC mixing services, MixTum.io does not mix its own funds in its accounts, but rather uses coins purchased from crypto exchanges. Thanks to this approach and the huge volumes of trading on exchanges, all transactions are guaranteed to remain transparent and flawless. Algorithms built into the system check the purity of incoming coins, ensuring a high level of reliability and security.\n\nFeatures of the site:\n\n\u2022 Money is merged in pools without using special mixing codes.\n\n\u2022 The service does not record order identification data and their characteristics.\n\n\u2022 The user is not able to set the time frame for mixing products.\n\n\u2022 Coins are purchased on exchanges such as Binance, OKX, DigiFinex, Cryptonex and others.\n\n\u2022 Each request has unique parameters. The mixer randomly determines the values of time delays (from 1 to 6 hours), selects intermediate wallets, sets the number of output transactions, the commission fee (from 4 to 5% + 0.0007 BTC) and determines what part of the funds will be returned to the user-specified wallets.\n\n\u2022 The minimum amount for mixing is 0.005 BTC.\n\n\u2022 There is a link to a discussion on the Bitcointalk forum.\n\nWhen placing an order, by default, two addresses are provided for delivery, but the system also supports individual settings, if necessary. When returning clean coins, the system automatically determines the best option for using an intermediate wallet, from which 10% to 90% of the total amount is transferred. Clear coins are sent through multiple transactions, each of which occurs at different time intervals for different amounts. This method is designed to complicate the process of cluster analysis.\n\n8. Anonymixer\n\nThe creators claim that their service provides complete anonymity when using the Bitcoin mixer. Key features include:\n\n\u2022 The minimum amount for mixing is only 1 satoshi.\n\n\u2022 Commission ranges from 1% to 2%, plus network commission.\n\n\u2022 No log storage.\n\n\u2022 Ability to use up to 10 addresses for deposits and up to 20 addresses for withdrawals.\n\n\u2022 Presence on the Bitcointalk forum.\n\nThe service provides a letter of guarantee in PDF and text formats. Working with a resource is possible both using JavaScript and without it, and the second option is considered safer. The site is also convenient for use on mobile devices.\n\nIn conclusion, when evaluating the landscape of Bitcoin mixing services, it becomes evident that each platform offers unique features catering to diverse user needs. Amidst this competitive field, Tumbler.io stands out due to its comprehensive approach to security, privacy, and user convenience. The innovative use of Tumbler code technology, combined with a commitment to no-log policies, positions Tumbler.io as a frontrunner in the realm of digital currency privacy solutions.\n\nFurthermore, its user-friendly interface and proactive approach to incorporating user feedback contribute to its growing reputation. While the choice of a mixer ultimately depends on individual requirements and preferences, Tumbler.io's blend of advanced features and steadfast security measures certainly make it a top contender to be considered the best in its class."

        "title": "Bitcoin price: BlackRock's bitcoin application shreds its ESG credibility - The Australian Financial Review",
        "content": "In October, a United Nations University report estimated if bitcoin were a country it would rank as the 27th most energy intensive in the world by consuming 173.4 terawatt hours of electricity annually during 2020 and 2021. This means the bitcoin network consumes more power annually than a country like Pakistan, which has 231 million people.\n\nBitcoin has little utility, other than as a store of value, or synthetic asset price bubble where early adopters sell to later adopters at a profit. Ironically, it was invented in 2009 as a permissionless network to transfer money free from interference from the likes of establishment giants such as BlackRock.\n\nIt cannot work as money in practice because it is too volatile, with owners reluctant to spend it if they anticipate its price will rise.\n\nCarbon footprint\n\nStill, to be fair to BlackRock, the size of bitcoin\u2019s carbon footprint remains contentious.\n\nAcademic studies have reached varied conclusions, and they tend to align with whatever motivates or incentivises their authors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decentralised and anonymised nature of bitcoin mining means it\u2019s impossible to know what percentage of miners are drawing on renewable energy sources versus those drawing electricity from coal-powered sources, for example.\n\nThe UN report estimated bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption to be equivalent to burning 84 billion pounds of coal annually, which would require the planting of 3.9 billion trees to offset.\n\nSelf-styled climate saviour Fink won\u2019t like research that points to bitcoin as closer to digital coal than digital gold.\n\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s supporters claim it is increasingly mined from renewable power. This trend may be correct, but it\u2019s still hard to justify allocating renewable power to bitcoin mining ahead of industries that deliver industrial value or improved living standards.\n\nFor example, in 2022 multiple Canadian provinces banned bitcoin miners from building new renewable power operations on the basis they diverted time, energy and capital resources away from projects that serve a greater utility to society.\n\nAsked about the work BlackRock has undertaken on bitcoin\u2019s ESG credentials, a spokeswoman said the company could not comment on issues related to the token or regulatory filing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe pointed to a 2023 KPMG report titled Bitcoin\u2019s Role in the ESG Imperative and other literature linked to BlackRock\u2019s commitment to sustainable investing. In addition, she said, BlackRock had praised a business called Energy Web, which lessens bitcoin\u2019s environmental damage.\n\nThe KPMG report says bitcoin uses around 110 terawatt hours of electricity a year, equal to 0.55 per cent of total global electricity consumption. It also argues bitcoin incentivises the increased integration of renewable energy into power grids as it attracts capital, with a conclusion that bitcoin can provide other benefits across an ESG framework.\n\nStill, others like Tesla abandoned their promotion of bitcoin in 2021 as it is too environmentally destructive for a company genuinely committed to climate protection.\n\nSo, even if we accept that some of bitcoin\u2019s required power is now sourced from renewable sources, its net contribution to society remains debatable.\n\nFink told CNBC in 2017 that bitcoin was an \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d, with the currency\u2019s reputation as a preferred choice for online hackers and terrorist financiers still sound.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut perhaps the Damascene conversion is explainable by arguments that bitcoin is no more amenable to money laundering than ordinary fiat money. This is also what KPMG finds.\n\nWhatever Fink\u2019s thinking, bitcoin looks a dubious bet for an executive who has positioned the world\u2019s largest asset management group as an arbiter of other corporations\u2019 commitments to fighting climate change."
