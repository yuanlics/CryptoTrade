        "title": "Bitcoin hits its highest level in a year - CNN",
        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nBitcoin on Friday shot up to its highest level in about a year.\n\nThe cryptocurrency rose above $31,400 a coin on Friday, its highest level since 2022, before paring back its gains. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, earlier this week traded above $30,000 for the first time since April, when the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank sent investors in search of safer places to hold their cash.\n\nBitcoin is up by about 87% this year. Its most recent gains come after a wave of interest in crypto from financial giants. BlackRock last week applied to register a bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund, according to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Crypto exchange EDX Markets, backed by firms such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity Digital Assets and Citadel Securities, also launched its digital asset trading platform this week.\n\nStill, the renewed fervor for crypto comes against a backdrop of regulatory crackdowns. The SEC earlier this month sued Coinbase, the US\u2019s largest crypto exchange, alleging that it is acting as an unregistered broker. That came just a day after federal regulators sued Binance, accusing the company of operating an illegal exchange in the United States and commingling customers\u2019 assets.\n\nDespite its surge this year, bitcoin remains well below its all-time highs of more than $60,000 in 2021. The cryptocurrency was hammered last year by the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive pace of interest rates and the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which helped spur a sweeping sell-off in the crypto market."

        "title": "Paradise lost? How crypto failed to deliver on its promises and what to do about it - European Central Bank",
        "content": "Speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a panel on the future of crypto at the 22nd BIS Annual Conference, 23 June 2023\n\nIntroduction\n\nSome 15 years ago, software developers using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto created the source code of what they thought could be decentralised digital cash.[1] Since then, crypto has relied on constantly creating new narratives to attract new investors, revealing incompatible views of what crypto-assets are or ought to be.\n\nThe vision of digital cash \u2013 of a decentralised payment infrastructure based on cryptography \u2013 went awry when blockchain networks became congested in 2017, resulting in soaring transaction fees.[2]\n\nSubsequently, the narrative of digital gold gained momentum, sparking a \u201ccrypto rush\u201d that led to one in five adults in the United States and one in ten in Europe speculating on crypto, with a peak market capitalisation of \u20ac2.5 trillion.[3]\n\nHowever, this illusion of crypto-assets serving as easy money and a robust store of value dissipated with the onset of the crypto winter in November 2021. The fall in the price of cryptos (Chart 1) led to a decrease of around \u20ac2 trillion worth of crypto assets within less than a year. This caught millions of investors unprepared.[4] An estimated three-quarters of bitcoin users suffered losses on their initial investments at this time.[5]\n\nChart 1 Prices of bitcoin and selected altcoins (USD thousands) Source: CryptoCompare. Notes: The data are for the period from 1 January 2015 to 15 June 2023 and are based on the price of crypto-assets as in the Crypto Coin Comparison Aggregated Index (CCCAGG) provided by CryptoCompare. The altcoins\u2019 names are abbreviated as follows: Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Polkadot (DOT), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), Dogecoin (DOGE), Binance Coin (BNB), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Uniswap (UNI), Solana (SOL).\n\nUnderstandably, many are now questioning the future of crypto-assets.\n\nBut the bursting of the bubble does not necessarily spell the end of crypto-assets.[6] People like to gamble and investing in crypto offers them a way to do so.[7]\n\nCrypto valuations are highly volatile, reflecting the absence of any intrinsic value. This makes them particularly sensitive to changes in risk appetite and market narratives. The recent developments that have affected leading crypto-asset exchanges have highlighted the contradictions of a system which, though created to counteract the centralisation of the financial system, has become highly centralised itself.\n\nToday I will contend that due to their limitations, cryptos have not developed into a form of finance that is innovative and robust, but have instead morphed into one that is deleterious. The crypto ecosystem is riddled with market failures and negative externalities, and it is bound to experience further market disruptions unless proper regulatory safeguards are put in place.\n\nPolicymakers should be wary of supporting an industry that has so far produced no societal benefits and is increasingly trying to integrate into the traditional financial system, both to acquire legitimacy as part of that system and to piggyback on it. Instead, regulators should subject cryptos to rigorous regulatory standards, address their social cost, and treat unsound crypto models for what they truly are: a form of gambling.\n\nThis may prompt the ecosystem to make more effort to provide genuine value in the field of digital finance.\n\nShifting narratives: from decentralised payments to centralised gambling\n\nThe core promise of cryptos is to replace trust with technology, contending that the concept \u201ccode is law\u201d will allow a self-policing system to emerge, free of human judgement and error. This would in turn make it possible for money and finance to operate without trusted intermediaries.\n\nHowever, this narrative often obfuscates reality. Unbacked cryptos have made no inroads into the conventional role of money. And they have progressively moved away from their original goal of decentralisation to increasingly rely on centralised solutions and market structures. They have become speculative assets[8], as well as a means of circumventing capital controls, sanctions or financial regulation.\n\nBlockchain limitations\n\nA key reason why cryptos have failed to make good on their claim to perform the role of money is technical. Indeed, the use of blockchain \u2013 particularly in the form of public, permissionless blockchain \u2013 for transacting crypto-assets has exhibited significant limitations.[9]\n\nTransacting cryptos on blockchains can be inefficient, slow and expensive; they face the blockchain trilemma, whereby aiming for optimal levels of security, scalability and decentralisation at the same time is not achievable.[10]\n\nCrypto-assets relying on a proof-of-work validation mechanism, which is especially relevant for bitcoin as the largest crypto-asset by market capitalisation[11], are ecologically detrimental. Public authorities will therefore need to evaluate whether the outsized carbon footprint of certain crypto-assets undermines their green transition commitments.[12] Moreover, proof-of-work validation mechanisms are inadequate for large-scale use.[13] Bitcoin, for example, can only accommodate up to seven transactions per second and fees can be exorbitant.\n\nWhile alternative solutions to overcome the blockchain trilemma and proof-of-work consensus shortcomings have emerged for faster and more affordable transactions, including those outside the blockchain, they have drawbacks of their own. \"Off-chain\" transactions conducted via third-party platforms compromise the core principles of crypto-assets, including security, validity and immutability.[14] Another important aspect is the operational risk inherent in public blockchains due to the absence of an accountable central governance body that manages operations, incidents or code errors.[15]\n\nMoreover, the handling of crypto-assets can be challenging. In a decentralised blockchain, users must protect their personal keys using self-custody wallets, which can discourage widespread adoption due to the tasks and risks involved, for example the theft or loss of a key. Given the immutability of blockchains, they do not permit transaction reversal.[16]\n\nInstability\n\nAnother key limitation of unbacked cryptos is their instability.\n\nUnbacked cryptos lack intrinsic value and have no backing reserves or price stabilisation mechanisms.[17] This makes them inherently highly volatile and unsuitable as a means of payment. Bitcoin, for instance, exhibits volatility levels up to four times higher than stocks, or gold (Chart 2).\n\nChart 2 Price volatility of cryptos compared with other assets (annualised seven-day rolling standard deviation of daily percentage changes of prices) Sources: CryptoCompare, Bloomberg, Refinitiv and ECB calculations. Notes: The data are for the period from 1 January 2015 to 15 June 2023. For visibility reasons, the maximum of the y-axis for Chart 2, panel b is set to 5. Nevertheless, on 30 and 31 January 2021 the price volatility of DOGE exceeded 28. Oil data refer to the European Brent Spot price. The altcoins\u2019 names are abbreviated as follows: Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Polkadot (DOT), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), Dogecoin (DOGE), Binance Coin (BNB), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Uniswap (UNI), Solana (SOL).\n\nSuch high volatility also means that households cannot rely on crypto-assets as a store of value to smooth their consumption over time. Similarly, firms cannot rely on crypto-assets as a unit of account for the calculation of prices or for their balance sheet.\n\nMoreover, unbacked cryptos do not improve our capacity to hedge against inflation. Indeed, their price developments exhibit an increasing correlation with stock markets (Chart 3). And empirical analysis finds that momentum in the crypto-asset market and global financial market volatility do have an impact on bitcoin trading against fiat currencies.[18]\n\nChart 3 Returns correlations of bitcoin vis-\u00e0-vis selected financial assets (yearly rolling correlation) Sources: Bloomberg, S&P Global iBoxx, CryptoCompare and ECB calculations. Notes: The data are for the period from 1 January 2016 to 16 June 2023.\n\nCryptos as a means of gambling and circumvention\n\nBut the very instability of unbacked cryptos does make them appealing as a means of gambling. And their use as such has been facilitated by the establishment of a centralised market structure that supports the broader use of crypto-assets.[19]\n\nCrypto exchanges have become gateways into the crypto ecosystem, often providing user access to crypto markets in conjunction with other services like wallets, custody, staking[20] or lending. Off-chain grids or third-party platforms have offered users easy and cost-effective ways to engage in trading and speculation, while stablecoins are being used to bridge the gap between fiat and crypto by promising a stable value relative to fiat currency.[21]\n\nBesides gambling, crypto assets are also being used for bypassing capital controls, sanctions and traditional financial regulation. A prime example is bitcoin, which is used to circumvent taxes and regulations, in particular to evade restrictions on international capital flows and foreign exchange transactions, including on remittances.[22] These practices may have destabilising macroeconomic implications in some jurisdictions, notably in developing and emerging markets.\n\nRisks from the growing centralisation of the crypto ecosystem\n\nThe crypto ecosystem\u2019s move away from its original goals towards more centralised forms of organisation, typically without regulatory oversight, is giving rise to substantial costs and an array of contradictions. There are two major facets to this phenomenon.\n\nThe re-emergence of classic financial sector shortcomings and vulnerabilities\n\nFirst, dependence on third-party intermediaries, many of which are still unregulated, has resulted in market failures and negative externalities, which crypto was initially designed to sidestep.\n\nThe crypto ecosystem, for instance, has cultivated its own concentration risks, with stablecoins assuming a key role in trading and liquidity provision within decentralised finance markets.[23] The difficulties faced by prominent stablecoins in the past year likely contributed significantly to the noticeable downturn in these markets.[24]\n\nIndeed, stablecoins often pose greater risks than initially thought. They introduce into the crypto space the kind of maturity mismatches commonly seen in money market mutual funds. As we have seen in the past year, redemption at par at all times is not guaranteed, risks of runs and contagion are omnipresent, and liquidation of reserve assets can lead to procyclical effects through collateral chains across the crypto ecosystem.\n\nAnother episode of instability driven by high concentration risk was the fall of the crypto exchange FTX. Initially the crisis seemed to primarily affect liquidity, but it quickly evolved into a solvency crisis. This situation arose due to FTX\u2019s inadequate risk management, unclear business boundaries and mishandling of customer funds. The repercussions of this event rippled through the crypto ecosystem, causing cascading liquidations[25] that underscored the interconnectedness and opacity of crypto markets. Ultimately, it showcased how swiftly confidence in the industry could deteriorate.\n\nSimilarities to the FTX case can be seen in the recent civil charges brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against the biggest remaining crypto exchange: Binance. These civil charges allege that Binance\u2019s CEO and Binance entities were involved in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure and calculated evasion of the law.[26] Should these allegations be proven, this would be yet another example of the fundamental shortcomings of the crypto ecosystem.\n\nThe recent crypto failures also show that risk, in itself, is technology-neutral. In financial services, it does not matter if a business ledger is kept on paper as it was for hundreds of years, in a centralised system as we have now or on a blockchain as in the crypto asset ecosystem. In the end, whether a firm remains in business or fails depends on how it manages credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and leverage. Crypto enthusiasts would do well to remember that new technology does not make financial risk disappear. The financial risk either remains or transforms into a different type. It is like pressing a balloon on one side: it will change in shape until it pops on the other side. And if the balloon is full of hot air, it may rise for a while but will burst in the end.\n\nLinks with the traditional financial sector\n\nThe second contradiction arises from the crypto industry\u2019s attempt to strengthen ties with actors in the financial system, including banks, big tech companies and the public sector.\n\nMajor payment networks[27] and intermediaries[28] have enhanced their support services for crypto-assets. Numerous prominent tech companies, including Meta (formerly Facebook) and Twitter, have explored ways to incorporate crypto into their platforms.[29] By leveraging their large customer base and offering a mix of payments and other financial services, tech firms, especially big techs, could solidify the ties between crypto-assets and the financial system.\n\nThe recent failures of Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank have highlighted the risks for banks associated with raising deposits from the crypto sector. The stability of these deposits is questionable given cryptos\u2019 volatility. The discontinuation of the Silvergate Exchange Network and SigNet, which functioned as a quasi-payment system for the crypto investments of Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank clients, also shows how crypto-assets service providers depend on the traditional financial sector for settlement in fiat money.\n\nThe crypto industry not only seeks to strengthen its ties with the traditional financial industry. It also seeks to gain access to the public safety net that strongly regulated financial entities benefit from.[30] Indeed, Circle, the issuer of the USD Coin (USDC) tried to gain access to the Federal Reserve's overnight reverse repurchasing facility in order to back its stablecoin.[31]\n\nThe crypto industry is seeking to grow by parasitising the financial system: it touts itself as an alternative to the financial sector, yet it seeks shelter within that very sector to address its inherent risks, all in the absence of adequate regulatory safeguards.\n\nThe public response: backing, regulating or innovating?\n\nThe public sector response can be encapsulated in three main suggestions.\n\nNot giving in to the temptation to offer public backing to cryptos\n\nFirst, the temptation to offer public backing to cryptos must be resisted.\n\nThe idea of permitting stablecoin issuers as non-bank financial institutions to hold their reserves at central banks might seem appealing, but could lead to serious adverse consequences.\n\nBy granting stablecoins access to the central bank\u2019s balance sheet, we would effectively outsource the provision of central bank money. If the stablecoin issuer were able to invest its reserve assets[32] in the form of risk-free deposits at the central bank, this would eliminate the investment risks that ultimately fall on the shoulders of stablecoin holders. And the stablecoin issuer could offer the stablecoin holders a means of payment that would be a close substitute for central bank money.[33]\n\nThis would compromise monetary sovereignty, financial stability and the smooth operation of the payment system. For example, a stablecoin could displace sovereign money by using the large customer network of a big tech, with far-reaching implications.[34] Therefore, central banks should exercise prudence and retain control over their balance sheet and the money supply.\n\nRegulating cryptos adequately and comprehensively\n\nSecond, regulators should refrain from implying that regulation can transform crypto-assets into safe assets. Efforts to legitimise unsound crypto models in a bid to attract crypto activities should be avoided.[35]\n\nMoreover, the principle of \"same activity, same risk, same regulation\" should be endorsed. Cryptos cannot become as safe as other assets and investors should be aware of the risks. Anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism rules should be enforced, and crypto activities of traditional firms should be carefully monitored.\n\nWhile some jurisdictions attempt to apply existing regulatory frameworks to crypto-assets, the EU\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation offers a customised regulatory structure that applies to all 27 EU Member States and draws on existing regulation where appropriate (e-money being one example). The EU has also updated existing regulation, for instance by extending the travel rule to crypto transactions.[36]\n\nDespite the EU taking the lead in establishing a comprehensive framework regulating crypto activities, further steps are necessary. All activities related to the crypto industry should be regulated, including decentralised finance activities like crypto-asset lending or non-custodial wallet services[37]. Moreover, the regulatory framework for unbacked crypto-assets may be deemed lighter than for stablecoins as it relies mainly on disclosure requirements for issuing white papers[38], and on the supervision of the service providers which will offer them for trading. The risks posed by unbacked crypto-assets, which are largely used for speculative purposes, should be fully recognised. Enhancing transparency and awareness of the risks associated with crypto-assets and their social cost are critical aspects of this approach. Public authorities will also need to address those social costs: for instance, cryptos\u2019 ecological footprint cannot be ignored in view of environmental challenges.\n\nAdditionally, the experience of FTX, which expanded massively with little oversight, underscores the importance of global crypto regulation and regulatory cooperation. The Financial Stability Board\u2019s recommendations[39] for the regulation and oversight of crypto-asset activities and markets need to be finalised and implemented urgently, also in non-FSB jurisdictions. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's standard on the prudential treatment of banks' crypto-asset exposures is a positive step in this direction. It stipulates conservative capital requirements for unbacked crypto-assets with a risk weight of 1,250%, as well as an exposure limit constraining the total amount of unbacked crypto a bank can hold to generally below 1% of Tier 1 capital. It will be key for the European Union and other Basel jurisdictions to transpose the Basel standard into their legislation by the 1 January 2025 deadline[40].\n\nHowever, regulation alone will not be sufficient.\n\nInnovating: digital settlement assets and central bank digital currencies\n\nThird, the public sector needs to contribute to the development of reliable digital settlement assets.\n\nCentral banks are innovating to provide a stability anchor that maintains trust in all forms of money in the digital age. Central bank money for retail use is currently only available in physical form \u2013 cash. But the digitisation of payments is diminishing the role of cash and its capacity to provide an effective monetary anchor. A central bank digital currency would offer a digital, risk-free standard and facilitate convertibility among different forms of private digital money. It would uphold the singleness of money and protect monetary sovereignty. We are advancing with our digital euro project and aim to complete our investigation phase later this year.\n\nFurthermore, the tokenisation of digital finance may require central banks to modify their technological infrastructure supporting the issuance of central bank money for wholesale transactions. This could involve establishing a bridge between market distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms and central bank infrastructures, or a new DLT-based wholesale settlement service with DLT-based central bank money.[41] We will involve the market in the exploratory work that we have recently announced.[42]\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, crypto-assets have been promoted as decentralised alternatives promising more resilient financial services. However, the reality does not live up to that promise. The blockchain technology underpinning crypto-assets can be extremely slow, energy-intensive and insufficiently scalable. The practicality of crypto-assets for everyday transactions is low due to their complex handling and significant price volatility.\n\nTo address these drawbacks, the crypto ecosystem has changed its narrative, favouring more centralised forms of organisation that emphasise crypto speculation and quick profit. But recent events have exposed the fragility of the crypto ecosystem, demonstrating how quickly confidence in crypto-assets can evaporate. In many respects, this ecosystem has recreated the very shortcomings and vulnerabilities that blockchain technology initially intended to address.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the crypto market seeks integration into the financial sector for increased relevance and public sector support. This would not provide the basis of a sustainable future for crypto. If anything, it would only heighten contradictions and vulnerabilities, resulting in greater instability and centralisation.\n\nThe public sector should adopt a determined position by establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework that addresses the social and environmental risks associated with crypto, including the use of unbacked crypto-assets for speculative purposes. It should also resist calls to provide state backing for cryptos, which would essentially socialise crypto risks. The public sector should instead focus its efforts on contributing to the development of reliable digital settlement assets, including through their work on central bank digital currencies.\n\nDecisive action of this kind should motivate the crypto ecosystem, including its foundational technology, the blockchain, to realign its objectives towards delivering real economic value within the digital finance landscape."

        "title": "BlackRock's Game-Changing Bitcoin ETF: What Every Investor Needs to Know - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Adding to the flurry of events in the crypto industry, BlackRock (BLK -0.43%), the world's largest asset manager, filed for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) last week.\n\nBlackRock's application sent shockwaves through the industry, amplified not only by its prominence in the global economy but also by the timing, coming just days after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against major players like Coinbase Global and Binance. Regardless of the timing, if BlackRock successfully enters the Bitcoin market, it has the potential to serve as a catalyst for a Bitcoin boon.\n\nBenefits of a spot ETF\n\nThe history of Bitcoin ETFs is lackluster. Today, there are no true Bitcoin ETFs on the market. Instead, there are a handful of trusts that try to track the token's price through future contracts.\n\nHistorically, these products have struggled to accurately track the price due to their reliance on speculative futures contracts, resulting in deviations. As a result, trusts often trade at a premium or discount since they lack the ability to directly purchase Bitcoin. For example, the prominent Bitcoin Trust from Grayscale currently trades at a 40% discount compared to the crypto's actual price.\n\nBut the proposed BlackRock Bitcoin ETF will remedy this problem, since it possesses characteristics more similar to a spot ETF, which unlike existing Bitcoin-based products on the market, will allow BlackRock to purchase or sell bitcoins at the end of each trading day to ensure that it accurately represents the true price of the token.\n\nA near-spotless record\n\nFor years, Grayscale and other notable firms like Fidelity, VanEck, and Ark Investment have submitted Bitcoin ETF applications, only to be consistently rejected by the SEC. Since the first application in 2013, numerous proposals have been turned down due to concerns over market manipulation, lack of regulation, and fraud risks in the Bitcoin market.\n\nBut the chances of approval for BlackRock's application appear extremely promising, given the firm's ability to get ETFs approved. With an impressive record of 575-1 in favor of approval, and a history of meeting market demand for its products, BlackRock has demonstrated a remarkable ability to navigate the regulatory landscape.\n\nNot only would BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF more closely resemble a true spot ETF, but it also looks to have hammered out solutions to the SEC's concerns over investor protection. The application states there will be added surveillance with the help of Nasdaq that will track customer identification and market trading data.\n\nBlackRock has also partnered with Coinbase to serve as the custodian of the actual bitcoins purchased, which will add greater levels of protection for investors.\n\nCrunching the numbers\n\nTo understand the magnitude of this approval's potential impact on Bitcoin's price, let's delve into the numbers. BlackRock has a massive portfolio totaling $9 trillion, bigger than the gross domestic product of most countries.\n\nAbout 11% of Bitcoin's current supply is sitting on exchanges representing roughly 2.2 million coins. Based on today's prices, that equates to around $66 billion worth of Bitcoin.\n\nFrom BlackRock's perspective, $66 billion is measly. Yet if just 0.7% of BlackRock's assets were allocated to Bitcoin, it would be enough to absorb all the coins currently available on exchanges.\n\nThis is a hypothetical scenario, of course, but it helps us truly grasp the immense significance and capital that could be eagerly waiting to flood into the Bitcoin market if the ETF is approved. The introduction of a more accurate Bitcoin ETF to the stock market has the potential to unleash a wave of adoption for the crypto like never before. There is plenty of evidence of institutional investors wanting to dive into Bitcoin, but the lack of suitable investment products has left their appetite unsatisfied.\n\nThe potential influx of institutional investors could create an unprecedented level of demand, propelling Bitcoin's price to new heights and reshaping the dynamics of the entire market. It could have a profound impact on the future of Bitcoin and the crypto industry as a whole."

        "content": "Bathhouse explained in an Instagram post on Wednesday that it is running mining rigs at its N 10th Street address in Brooklyn, which generate heat as a byproduct. The heat is taken by heat exchangers and used to heat the venue's pools, via a circulating system.\n\nA bathhouse in Brooklyn, New York, is heating its spa pools with waste heat from Bitcoin mining rigs - and sparked a social media controversy.\n\n\"Enjoy a hot pool while supporting the Bitcoin network,\" said Bathhouse's post. \"The pools absorb the heat and circulate cool liquid back to the miners. The process repeats forever.\"\n\nThe process is strikingly similar to Deep Green's campaign to heat swimming pools in the UK with heat generated by Edge data centers, which launched in March. However, Deep Green is offering its compute resources to AI and Machine Learning users via cloud workload aggregators. Bathhouse's support for Bitcoin mining has proven more controversial.\n\nSome readers complained that Bitcoin is inherently wasting energy, while others appeared to object to cryptocurrency on fashion grounds.\n\nNew York is increasingly hostile to cryptocurrencies. Following the failure of crypto exchange FTX, banks have backpedaled on moves to integrate cryptocurrencies into the financial systems, while the state passed a bill to ban crypto mining with fossil-derived electricity in June 2022.\n\nIn October 2022 a Federal report found that crypto mining uses 0.9 percent of the world's electricity, and as much energy as conventional data centers in the US.\n\nFans of the Bathhouse have pointed out that it would take exactly the same amount of electricity to heat the pools, whether or not the electricity also generated Bitcoin. In their view, the scheme is attacking the problem of Bitcoin's waste of energy.\n\n\"Someone needs to teach people an emergency thermodynamics class,\" commented Jalil Farid on Twitter, while others mocked the users for their lack of understanding.\n\n\"They want pure, unadulterated heat for their salt baths, not that dirty byproduct heat,\" said Phil Geiger.\n\nSome critics perhaps wanted the computing to be used for more valuable functions: \"I\u2019m concerned about who is mining this cryptocurrency, who is profiting from it, and whether I support that. We\u2019re gonna need some transparency,\u201d said one.\n\nBatthouse explains that it describes itself as a bathhouse, not a spa, because: \"Bathhouses offer functionality over fluff, while spas provide an experience that we like to call 'performative relaxation'.\""

        "content": "What happened\n\nCryptocurrencies and crypto stocks continued their ascent higher today as institutional interest in the space has sparked a major rally.\n\nSince late afternoon yesterday, the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC 1.03%), traded roughly 3% higher as of 2:07 p.m. ET today and had surpassed $31,100 as of this writing.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH -1.27%) had exploded by close to 29%, while the price of the Bitcoin-mining company Bit Digital (BTBT 0.45%) was up roughly 4.4% on the day after having been up by close to 12% at one point earlier.\n\nSo what\n\nEver since BlackRock (BLK -0.43%) filed to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the sector has rallied, and that excitement did not lose steam today, largely as analysts continued to point to what a catalyst it could be if BlackRock receives approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn a recent research note, JPMorgan Chase analysts wrote:\n\nShould BlackRock or other firms be successful in this endeavor for a spot Bitcoin ETF, this may incite competition for spot-Bitcoin ETFs, incentivize firms to create other spot-crypto ETFs, and/or pave the way for other crypto productions that incorporate traditional financial instruments.\n\nBitcoin Cash also continued its impressive run, which was sparked by news earlier this week that the crypto exchange EDX Markets had gone live and is offering Bitcoin Cash as one of the cryptocurrencies on the platform. EDX is backed by Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Citadel, showing another foray into the digital asset space by mainstream financial giants.\n\nIn other news today, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the large U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN -1.72%) in what is apparently the court's first big crypto ruling. The case involved a Coinbase user suing the company after money in his account was allegedly stolen.\n\nThe matter had sparked a class action lawsuit that was proceeding until the Supreme Court put the case on pause, as Coinbase seeks to take the matter to arbitration. The Supreme Court also dismissed another case in which users claimed that Coinbase breached false advertising laws in California by advertising a contest that allowed users to win prizes in the form of the meme token Dogecoin.\n\nWhile the cases may not have huge ramifications for the industry, they could hint at a pro-crypto tilt for the court, which could be helpful down the line.\n\nIn an article published today by Forbes, Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal told the publication, \"We're prepared to rely upon the courts because we think it's critical to the future of our industry.\" Coinbase and Binance were recently sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nNow what\n\nThe crypto industry still seems to be benefiting from all of the good news about traditional financial giants diving further into the space, which I think is giving investors confidence because the moves, if successful, would likely broaden exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The Supreme Court's decision is also likely to give investors confidence about battles that are likely coming down the road.\n\nI think Bitcoin is worth having exposure to and will end up appreciating on more of a long-term basis. But I'm not really that bullish on Bitcoin Cash or Bit Digital. I own a little Bitcoin Cash but purchased it a while ago and prefer the largest cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin right now.\n\nThe Bitcoin miners benefit when Bitcoin does well but are ultimately more volatile in an already volatile industry."

PYMNTS noted at the time that the project showed the firms\u2019 faith in the crypto market and could offer a boost to the industry.\n\nAnother project that Bloomberg cited as a contributor to bitcoin\u2019s recent rise, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s euro-denominated transactions with its blockchain-based JPM Coin, went live Wednesday (June 21).\n\nThe benefits of this offering include payments that operate around the clock, payments that are executed more quickly than traditional transactions, and the ability to initiate payments that are not yet due, Bloomberg reported Friday."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) will hit new all-time highs in 2023, and October is the favorite month for it, a popular trader says.\n\nIn a Twitter update on June 22, Credible Crypto argued that the next four months should deliver the bullish BTC price momentum needed to tackle $69,000.\n\nOctober \u201cfairly logical\u201d for new Bitcoin all-time highs\n\nBitcoin has put in a solid performance this month, and Credible Crypto is increasingly optimistic for continuation. To do so, BTC/USD needs to present increasingly larger green monthly candles to keep it in line with previous impulse periods.\n\n\u201cWhats clear with any parabolic advance is that momentum increases exponentially and peaks at the top. We can see this in both prior impulsive moves from 3k-14k and from 10k-60k,\u201d he explained.\n\nThis time around, Bitcoin has delivered a successful retest of support on monthly timeframes, with $25,000 now possibly a springboard for a new \u201cparabolic advance.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo with that in mind, let\u2019s take our current situation- monthly retest complete and the largest monthly candle we have seen thus far was a 10k move which broke us above the monthly level of 25k,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cThis means I would expect that once expansion begins (which it looks like it has) we should see monthly moves of > 10k at a time, easily. From current levels to prior ATH is a $40,000 gap. This gap should then, logically, be covered within a few monthly candles if this is a parabolic advance.\u201d\n\nTiming for such a move remains open, Credible Crypto added, while suggesting October as a \u201cfairly logical guesstimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith that being said, that\u2019s all this is- an estimation based on the logic presented above,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u201cI am not saying we MUST hit new all time highs by October, I AM saying I do think we will hit new ATH by the end of this year and if someone forced me to pick a month in which I think this will occur it would be October. Let\u2019s see how things play out.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart.

Over the past week, Fidelity, Invesco, WisdomTree and Valkyrie have followed investment giant BlackRock in applying for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the United States Securities Exchange Commission, which some analysts believe is the reason for Bitcoin\u2019s price surge in the past days.\n\nBinance.US solves USD withdrawal issues but warns it won\u2019t last long\n\nCrypto exchange Binance.US informed customers that it has resolved U.S. dollar withdrawal issues after working with its banking partners, though it warned the relief may not last. The exchange suspended dollar deposits and notified its customers of an incoming pause to fiat withdrawal channels on June 9, amid its ongoing battle with the SEC. Binance.US has encouraged customers that have a failed withdrawal attempt to resubmit their requests. Any remaining USD balances held in customer accounts will be converted into Tether at a future date.\n\nAtomic Wallet users have been left wanting more answers, despite the decentralized wallet provider finally releasing a full \u201cevent statement\u201d about the June exploit \u2014 which some estimate has run up to $100 million in losses. In the statement, Atomic didn\u2019t point to what exactly led to the exploit, only laying out the four most \u201cprobable\u201d causes, including a virus on user devices, an infrastructure breach, a man-in-the-middle attack or malware code injection. According to the company, \u201cless than 0.1%\u201d of app users were affected, but the figure is still rebuffed by many online.\n\nUK government moves forward on financial markets bill for potential regulation of crypto\n\nLawmakers in the United Kingdom are moving forward with legislation that could help support the adoption of crypto in the country. First introduced to the U.K. Parliament in July 2022, the Financial Services and Markets Bill was aimed at ensuring the country maintained its place in the financial world following Brexit, including granting authority on digital asset regulation. The bill went through a third reading in the House of Lords, one of the final stages in passage before considering any additional amendments and being signed into law.\n\nFed sees stablecoin as form of money, wants \u2018robust\u2019 role in its oversight, Powell says\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve Board sees payment stablecoins as a form of money, Chair Jerome Powell said on June 21 when addressing Congress about the proposed stablecoin bill. Powell took a position that runs contrary to that of SEC chairman Gary Gensler. Last year, Gensler spoke at a Senate Banking Committee hearing saying that stablecoins may require registration and regulation with the SEC. Gensler has also consistently stated that all cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoin, are securities.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $30,697, Ether (ETH) at $1,896 and XRP at $0.49. The total market cap is at $1.19 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nAmong the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Bitcoin Cash (BCH) at 83.66%, Pepe (PEPE) at 67.59% and Bitcoin SV (BSV) at 51.87%.\n\nThe top three altcoin losers of the week are KuCoin Token (KCS) at -8.21%, Quant (QNT) at -6.51% and BitTorrent(New) (BTT) at -4.72% .\n\n\n\nFor more info on crypto prices, make sure to read Cointelegraph\u2019s market analysis.\n\nMost Memorable Quotations\n\n\n\n\u201cWe do see payment stablecoins as a form of money, and [\u2026] it would be appropriate to have quite a robust federal role in what happens in stablecoin going forward.\u201d\n\nJerome Powell, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve\n\n\u201cIt is becoming very obvious Web3 financial rails are the future.\u201d\n\nLisa Wade, CEO of DigitalX\n\n\u201cBlackRock breathed new life into the [Bitcoin ETF] race.\u201d\n\nEric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg\n\n\u201cIf well designed, CBDCs can strengthen the usability, resilience, and efficiency of payment systems and increase financial inclusion in [Latin America and the Caribbean].\u201d\n\nInternational Monetary Fund\n\n\u201cCrypto will become the native currency of AI.\u201d\n\nRobby Yung, the CEO of Animoca Brands\n\n\u201cThe Great Accumulation of bitcoin has begun.\u201d\n\nCameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini\n\nPrediction of the Week\n\nBitcoin \u2018parabolic advance\u2019 means BTC price all-time high in 2023 \u2014 Trader\n\nBitcoin will hit new all-time highs in 2023, and October is the favored month for it, a popular trader said. In a Twitter update on June 22, pseudonymous trader Credible Crypto argued that the next four months should deliver the bullish BTC price momentum needed to tackle $69,000.\n\n\u201cWhats clear with any parabolic advance is that momentum increases exponentially and peaks at the top. We can see this in both prior impulsive moves from 3k-14k and from 10k-60k,\u201d he explained. This time around, Bitcoin has delivered a successful retest of support on monthly timeframes, with $25,000 now possibly a springboard for a new \u201cparabolic advance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would expect that once expansion begins (which it looks like it has) we should see monthly moves of > 10k at a time, easily. From current levels to prior ATH is a $40,000 gap. This gap should then, logically, be covered within a few monthly candles if this is a parabolic advance,\u201d he said.\n\nFUD of the Week\n\nPrime Trust can\u2019t honor customer withdrawals, says Nevada regulator\n\nPrime Trust\u2019s financial condition is \u201ccritically deficient,\u201d and the crypto custodian has been unable to honor customer withdrawals since June 21, according to Nevada\u2019s business regulator. In a cease and desist order, the regulator claimed Prime Trust\u2019s is in an \u201cunsafe or unsound condition\u201d to continue business. The company now has 30 days to respond to the order and can request an administrative hearing to contest it. The move comes a few days after its subsidiary, Banq, filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States.\n\nApple removes malicious Trezor app from App Store\n\nAn apparent malicious app purporting to be crypto hardware wallet Trezor has been taken off Apple\u2019s App Store, though a quick search has revealed that other copycat apps are still lurking. After a Twitter user warned the tech company, the app was quickly removed. Fake wallet apps on Apple\u2019s App Store are nothing new. In 2021, one user reportedly lost $600,000 in Bitcoin after downloading a malicious Trezor app from the App Store.\n\nTwitter suspends memecoin-linked AI bot after Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018scam crypto\u2019 claim\n\nTwitter has suspended the account of the popular memecoin-linked, AI-powered bot \u201cExplain This Bob\u201d after Elon Musk alleged it was a \u201cscam crypto account.\u201d The bot was created by Prabhu Biswal from India and used OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model to comprehend and provide responses to tweets by those who tagged the account. It amassed over 400,000 followers before the suspension. The project was also linked to the ERC-20 memecoin Bob Token (BOB), which was launched in April. Since the suspension, the hashtag \u201cFREEBOB\u201d has circulated on Crypto Twitter.\n\nBest Cointelegraph Features\n\nBitcoin 2023 in Miami comes to grips with \u2018shitcoins on Bitcoin\u2019\n\nBitcoin maximalists have started to rationalize the idea of NFTs and tokens on Bitcoin as being inherently better than those on Ethereum.\n\nCrypto City guide to Sydney: More than just a \u2018token\u2019 bridge\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of innovation that\u2019s coming out of this town \u2014 much more than you see on a global stage.\u201d\n\nPeter McCormack\u2019s Twitter regrets: \u2018I can feel myself being a dick\u2019 \u2014 Hall of Flame\n\nBedford\u2019s Monopoly millionaire only cares about Bitcoin, thinks CBDCs \u201care bullshit,\u201d and has a love/hate relationship with Twitter."

        "title": "Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin remains above US$30,000 as market shrugs off Prime Trust\u2019s cease order - Forkast News",
        "content": "Bitcoin rose 17.77% from June 16 to June 23 to trade at US$30,079 at 7:00 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose past US$30,000 for the first time since April 19. Ether rose 12.61% over the week to US$1,879.\n\nThe business regulator of the U.S. state of Nevada on Wednesday issued a cease and desist order to crypto custodian Prime Trust, alleging that the firm could not honor customer withdrawals. The move grew market concern as Prime Trust was the tech partner of TrueUSD (TUSD), the fifth largest stablecoin by market cap. On Thursday, TrueUSD said it has no exposure to Prime Trust and that the firm maintains multiple USD rails for minting and redemption.\n\nFollowing the news, Bitcoin fell to a daily low of US$29,689 around 11:55 p.m. on Thursday but recovered above US$30,000 as investors remained upbeat following one of this year\u2019s most eventful weeks that saw notable TradFi alumni entering the crypto space.\n\nThe institutional adoption wave started last week, when the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, which if accepted, would be the first publicly-traded Bitcoin product on the U.S. market. Earlier this week, Germany\u2019s largest bank Deutsche Bank also applied for a license to operate a crypto custody service, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe turbulences of 2022 have led to a decline in confidence in crypto-native institutions, presenting traditional financial institutions with a prime opportunity to enter the crypto market,\u201d Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast in a LinkedIn response.\n\n\u201cInitiatives like Deutsche Bank applying for a digital asset custody license should improve investor sentiment\u2026 All in all, regulation and institutional players will lead to an influx of fiat money into the crypto sector in the long run, driving prices up.\u201d\n\nEDX Markets, a crypto exchange backed by major Wall Street players like Citadel Securities, Fidelity and Charles Schwab, officially launched on Tuesday in the U.S., despite the recent regulatory crackdown on crypto.\n\nNew York-based asset management firm WisdomTree also filed an application for a Bitcoin ETF on Tuesday, a day before Valkyrie Investments filed its own spot Bitcoin ETF application. Rumors are circulating that Fidelity is also preparing its own application.\n\nJames Wo, the founder and chief executive officer of crypto investment firm DFG, said that BlackRock\u2019s move means \u201cold money\u201d from traditional finance is entering the crypto space.\n\n\u201cIf the application can be approved, it shows that the SEC is not just cracking down on cryptocurrencies, but SEC regulation will help further the maturity of the industry, and more products similar to ETF will emerge, which is a great benefit for the industry.\u201c wrote Wo, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, said that there are more rumors circulating about Fidelis preparing its own spot Bitcoin ETF application.\n\n\u201cThis move could be indicative of institutional players joining the crypto market and may signal an uptick in institutional interest. The potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF has been highly anticipated by many industry experts as it could bring more mainstream adoption to cryptocurrency,\u201d wrote Stadelmann, in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.17 trillion on Friday at 7:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 12.5% from US$1.04 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$583 billion, Bitcoin represented 49.9% of the market while Ether, valued at US$225 billion, accounted for 19.3%.\n\nNotable Movers: PEPE & STX\n\nPepe, the year\u2019s most trending memecoin, was this week\u2019s biggest loser in the top 100. Pepe started gaining momentum on Wednesday, rallying 64.49% to US$0.000001537, as risk appetite returned.\n\nSTX, the native token of Bitcoin smart contract layer Stacks, was the week\u2019s second-biggest gainer. The token started picking up on Tuesday, boosted by Bitcoin\u2019s bullish momentum paired with the recent spot Bitcoin ETF applications by the likes of BlackRock.\n\nSee related article: Why the US is waging war on Binance, Coinbase\n\nNext week: More Bitcoin ETF applications on the way?\n\nKomodo\u2019s Stadelmann said that institutional interest in crypto is heating up due to developing regulations and increasing customer demand.\n\n\u201cMajor financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have also expressed interest in offering crypto-related products to their clients. Moreover, the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price has further piqued the interest of institutional investors who are seeking exposure to this emerging asset class,\u201d wrote Stadelmann.\n\nJamie Coutts, a senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said that Bitcoin is in an early bull market and expects the cycle to last until November 2025.\n\n\u201cBitcoin will likely absorb more of the global economic base while subsuming value from traditional banking and payment providers,\u201d wrote Coutts.\n\nNext week, investors will be anticipating speeches from key Federal Reserve officials, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, for cues on the health of the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nEuropean investors will be looking to European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde\u2019s speech, for hints on the block\u2019s future monetary policy decisions.\n\nSee related article: Crypto firms eye Hong Kong amid tough US regulations, says fintech association chair"

        "content": "A bathhouse in Brooklyn, New York, has left users on Instagram and Twitter divided after it revealed that it is using Bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs to heat its spa.\n\nIn a June 21 Instagram post, Bathhouse explained it is running Bitcoin mining rigs at its location in Brooklyn, which generates heat as a byproduct. In the post, it described in three steps how the heat is taken by heat exchangers and used to heat the venue\u2019s pools via a circulating system.\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of creating valid blocks that add transaction records to Bitcoin\u2019s public ledger, which is called a blockchain. Bitcoin mining consumes a significant amount of energy, often sourced from fossil fuels. This contributes to carbon emissions and raised concerns about its environmental footprint.\n\nIn January 2022, a report estimated that the Bitcoin mining network emits 42 megatons of carbon dioxide, accounting for 0.08% of the world\u2019s total production.\n\nInstagram users who follow the Bathhouse account weren\u2019t all sold on the idea. One user who identifies as Annalarranaga posted, \u201cThis makes me like Bathhouse less. Now I\u2019m concerned about who is mining this cryptocurrency, who is profiting from it, and whether I support that. We\u2019re gonna need some transparency.\u201d\n\nScreenshot of comments on Bathhouse\u2019s Instagram post. Source: Instagram\n\nAnother user further claimed that Bathhouse customers \u201cwant pure, unadulterated heat for their salt baths, not that dirty byproduct heat.\u201d On the other hand, some reveled in the disdain users had for the mining-heated pools, while at least one seemed happy with them, saying, \u201cI for one think this is a great way to heat the pools and will check this place out because of this.\u201d\n\nScreenshot of comments about Bathhouse\u2019s bitcoin-mining pool heating. Source: Twitter\n\nDespite Bathhouse\u2019s specific example of carbon-neutral Bitcoin mining, the impact of Bitcoin mining on the environment remains a significant concern for some, leading to unfavorable responses from them.\n\nRelated: CleanSpark buys two Bitcoin mining campuses for $9.3M\n\nThis, however, isn\u2019t the first time Bitcoin mining heat has been repurposed to save energy. In Europe, miners have devised creative ways of recycling the heat generated by solving valid Bitcoin blocks. In Norway, Bitcoin miner and data center Kryptovault uses the hot air generated by Bitcoin mining rigs to dry out chopped logs.\n\nMagazine: Inside the Iranian Bitcoin mining industry"

        "content": "A trendy Brooklyn bathhouse picked up steam this week when it boasted that it uses Bitcoin mining to generate heat for its pools.\n\n\u201cDid you know our pools are heated with byproduct from Bitcoin mining?\u201d Williamsburg\u2019s Bathhouse posted on Instagram, drawing hundreds more comments than usual.\n\nA video explains in a few steps how the futuristic process to mine the virtual currency goes down.\n\n\u201cStep one: mine Bitcoin. Mining uses electricity for computing power and generates heat as a byproduct,\u201d the narrator says.\n\nBitcoin mining involves solving complicated math problems with specialized software that verifies transactions in the currency, according to the financial services company Bankrate.\n\n\u201cStep two: send the heat generated by the miners to heat exchangers and heat our pools. Step three: enjoy hot pool while supporting the Bitcoin network,\u201d the video continues. \u201cThe pools absorb the heat and circulate cool liquid back to the miners.\u201d\n\nMining Bitcoin is energy-intensive and critics argue that it is bad for the environment.\n\n\u201cThis makes me like Bathhouse less,\u201d commented one user. \u201cNow I\u2019m concerned about who is mining this cryptocurrency, who is profiting from it, and whether I support that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t supporting that sh-t,\u201d said another.\n\nOthers applauded the innovation.\n\n\u201cThis is awesome,\u201d wrote one person. \u201cI pretty much never leave Manhattan but I just booked a massage.\u201d\n\n3 A Brooklyn spa announced on social media that it uses mining from cryptocurrency to hear its pools. Bathhouse/Instagram\n\n3 Pools at Bathhouse in Williamsburg are heated through cryptocurrency mining, the company shared. Bathhouse/Instagram\n\nThe company remains passionate about its business model.\n\n\u201cInstead of using electricity for an electric pool heater, we use electricity to run the miners,\u201d Bathhouse co-founder Jason Goodman told Yahoo\u2019s In The Know.\n\n\u201cThe net result is that we are essentially energy-neutral because we are powering the miners with energy we already needed to purchase to heat our pools,\u201d Goodman continued. \u201cTherefore, we are able to use this electricity \u2018twice\u2019 in a certain sense \u2026 We are able to recover a lot of our energy costs while supporting the Bitcoin network and nerding out on a fun engineering project.\u201d\n\n3 Critics say mining cryptocurrency has a negative toll on the environment. Bathhouse/Instagram\n\nThe company created a new Frequently Asked Questions section on its website to provide some more insight.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, if Bitcoin is able to have even a small percentage of positive impact that we think it might, it would be important to be open minded about it,\u201d Bathhouse explains.\n\nThe old factory-turned-massage-house opened in 2021 and features spa treatments such as massages as scrubs and has a restaurant and bar."

        "title": "Bitcoin price data suggests bulls will succeed in holding $30K as support this time - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading above $31,000 after its 24.3% rally between June 15 and June 23, which caught many off guard. For bears, that meant facing $165 million in short futures contract liquidations, but the unexpected rally also brought some degree of discomfort for investors using Bitcoin derivatives.\n\nInflation remains the biggest question mark for traditional markets, a point highlighted by the recent 50-basis-point interest rate increase by the Bank of England, followed by similar moves in Norway and Switzerland, leading to the highest cost of capital in over a decade for the region.\n\nIn response to questions from lawmakers on the United States House Financial Services Committee on June 21, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that \u201cthe process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go\u201d and reiterated that \u201cnearly all FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to raise interest rates somewhat further by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nAccording to JPMorgan strategists led by Marko Kolanovic, \u201cthe economy\u2019s recent resilience may delay the onset of a recession,\u201d so the impacts of the monetary tightening movement by the central bank are yet to be felt, \u201cand ultimately a recession will likely be necessary to return inflation to target.\u201d\n\nInvestors now question whether Bitcoin has the strength to trade above the $30,000 resistance amid the bearish pressure emerging from a potential economic recession and further central bank activity aimed at curbing the demand for capital.\n\nConsequently, traders should closely monitor Bitcoin futures contract premiums and the costs of hedging using BTC options.\n\nBitcoin derivatives show modest improvement\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, BTC futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe demand for leveraged BTC longs slightly increased as the futures contract premium jumped to 4.3% on June 22 from 3.2% one week prior, although it remains below the neutral 5% threshold.\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become more optimistic. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign of when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe 25% delta skew metric did a complete turnaround as it exited the \u201cfear\u201d mode on June 16 as Bitcoin\u2019s price reclaimed the $26,000 support. The indicator continued to improve until June 22, culminating with the moderate \u201cgreed\u201d sentiment at a negative 8% skew.\n\nRelated: \u2018Bitcoin-only\u2019 buy-and-hold investing outperforms altcoins over long term, analysis shows\n\nThe absence of excessive optimism is a good sign\n\nTypically, a 4.3% futures basis and a negative 8% delta skew would be considered neutral market indicators, but that is not the case given the 21.5% Bitcoin price rally between June 15 and June 22. A certain amount of skepticism is healthy for buyers using derivatives contracts and opens room for further leverage use if needed.\n\nThe heated legal battle between Binance and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission presents a risk for BTC futures contracts. The decisions from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia could severely impact the cryptocurrency market, as Binance holds the biggest market share in the spot and derivatives markets.\n\nUncertainty around the crypto regulatory environment and the growing risks of an economic recession are possible explanations for Bitcoin derivatives traders\u2019 lack of excitement.\n\nApart from those external risks, there is no apparent driver to justify a sharp BTC price correction, giving bulls just the right amount of optimism to keep the positive momentum.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin rose and held above US$30,000 in Friday morning trading in Asia, holding onto the strong gains made this week on the back of growing institutional interest in the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ether was little changed. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Cardano\u2019s ADA token gaining and Binance\u2019s BNB losing ground. Overall, most tokens were holding weekly gains spurred by Bitcoin\u2019s rally.\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin rose 0.33% over the last 24 hours to US$30,056.27 at 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, up 17.52% for the past week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency broke through resistance at US$30,000 early morning on Thursday for the first time since April, reaching a high of US$30,737.33.\n\nEther was little changed, rising 0.02% to US$1,879.66 to gain 12.87% for the week.\n\nBlackRock Inc.,the world\u2019s largest asset manager with US$8.59 trillion under management at the end of 2022, filed an application on June 15 for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Two more U.S.-based asset managers \u2014 WisdomTree and Invesco \u2014 also filed Bitcoin ETF applications this week.\n\n\u201cMajor cryptocurrencies were seeing strong performances this week \u2014 Traders reacted positively to the possibility of seeing a Bitcoin ETF come to market,\u201d Denys Peleshok, head of Asia at Belize-based financial brokerage CPT Markets, in email comments.\n\n\u201cA successful launch of a bitcoin ETF could open the way for more inflows from individuals and professional investors alike,\u201d Peleshok added. \u201cThe investment vehicle could lower the barrier of entry into the market and attract significant volumes of investment into bitcoin in particular.\u201d\n\nBoston-based Fidelity Investments, another major financial services company that managed US$4.2 trillion as of the first quarter of 2023, is also said to be preparing to file a Bitcoin ETF application.\n\nIn another encouraging move for institutional adoption of crypto, EDX Markets opened for business on Tuesday as a New Jersey-based digital asset exchange backed by Wall Street firms such as Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab Corp. EDX said U.S. regulatory compliance is a core feature of its operations.\n\nThese moves by traditional finance follow the crackdown on the U.S. crypto sector this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which filed lawsuits against the Binance.US and Coinbase exchanges. The SEC alleges they illegally traded cryptocurrencies that should have been registered as financial securities, among other charges.\n\n\u201c[Bitcoin could] continue benefiting from its status as a quasi-commodity when most other digital assets are considered securities by regulators. As a result, Bitcoin could emerge as a winner from the SEC\u2019s legal efforts,\u201d said Peleshok of CPT Markets.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented on Bitcoin during a monetary policy hearing on Capitol Hill this week, describing the token as having \u201cstaying power\u201d as an asset class.\n\nMeanwhile, Mastercard Inc., the world\u2019s second largest payment processor, announced Thursday that it will expand its Engage network to embrace more blockchain and digital asset partners. Mastercard Engage connects businesses with qualified technology partners.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed, although making weekly gains spearheaded by Bitcoin. Binance\u2019s BNB token lost 2.53% to US$242.49 while gaining 2.36% in the past seven days.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA rose 2.21% to US$0.2922, adding 10.90% in the last week.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market capitalization rose 0.14% to US$1.17 trillion in the last 24 hours, while trading volume fell 25.24% to US$45.06 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT looking up\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.78% to 2,930.17 in the 24 hours to 8:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index gained 1.3% for the week.\n\nTotal NFT transactions rose 0.64% to US$23.9 million, while transactions on Ethereum dipped 3.70% to US$15.56 million. Bitcoin was the second largest blockchain by NFT transactions, rising 8.56% to US$2.74 million.\n\nYuga Labs\u2019 Bored and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs were the top selling collections in the last 24 hours. Bored Ape trades rose 1.12% to US$3.07 million, while Mutant Ape surged 23.92% to US$1.05 million.\n\n\u201cNFT traders are optimistic about the future, and clearly willing to spend as we see from multiple $145k Bored Ape Yacht Club sales, along with a $286k sale, but still the index is just above its all-time low point,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nThat indicates investors remain hesitant as a whole, apart from some whales, said Petscher, adding that may be because of a lack of a track record for some projects holding value over time.\n\nThe Gods Unchained Cards NFT collection from ImmutableX was the third most traded collection, even as transactions fell 8.75% to US$754,805. Immutable announced Wednesday that its NFT trading card game Gods Unchained is now listed on game distribution platform Epic Games Store, which has over 230 million customers.\n\n\u201cLots of eyes on Azuki tomorrow as they have a big event in Las Vegas,\u201d Petscher said. Azuki, the Japanese anime-inspired NFT collection of 10,000 generative avatars, became one of the most popular collections since its debut in January 2022 and still holds an active community.\n\nAzuki is the eighth most traded collection according to Cryptoslam data, with US$537,366 worth of transactions over the past day. \u201cWe\u2019re watching to see what big announcements they may have \u2013 a new token, or possibly a game? Azuki has a track record of delivering on hype,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nElsewhere, Swiss-based multinational food manufacturer Nestl\u00e9 S.A. and U.S.-based snack brand Slim Jim both announced the launch of NFT collections, signaling continued mainstream interest in the blockchain-powered technology.\n\nEquity futures edge down\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell | Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, following a mixed regular trading session on Thursday.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped 0.06%, S&P 500 futures lost 0.11%, while Nasdaq futures inched down 0.084%.\n\nTech stocks gained in the Thursday session performed well with Apple Inc. setting a new record high of US$187, while Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc. also rising.\n\nOn the U.S. battlefront against inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told the U.S. Congress on Tuesday and Thursday this week that the central bank is in consensus that more interest rate increases are likely this year to control high price pressure. The U.S. inflation rate is currently at around 4.05%, down from last month\u2019s 4.93% but still far from Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\n\nU.S. interest rates are now between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The Fed paused rate hikes at the last meeting on June 14, but indicated two more hikes this year to bring rates to around 5.6%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on interest rates is July 26 and the majority view is they will raise. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 76.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, up from 71.9% on Thursday, and a 23.1% chance the Fed will leave rates unchanged.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

Investors can buy shares of an ETF to gain exposure to those securities without owning them directly. In the case of Bitcoin ETFs, there have been two main types: Bitcoin futures and Bitcoin spot.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe BITX fund will be a leveraged ETF. Leveraged funds use debt or financial derivatives\u2014in this case, Bitcoin futures\u2014as leverage to amplify the returns of a benchmark index.

        "content": "The bid for the first Bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States is gaining traction following BlackRock\u2019s recent application, with both former applicants and new players seeking permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list a crypto ETF.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s unclear whether the SEC will finally allow a Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock\u2019s initiative appears to have \u201cbreathed new life into the race\u201d amid the ongoing crackdown on the crypto industry.\n\nOther headline news includes Wall Street titans backing a newly launched crypto exchange despite the current regulatory landscape. The newcomer is EDX Markets, supported by names such as Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab \u2014 among others.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto pioneers keep fighting for survival. On June 17, a U.S. judge approved an agreement between Binance.US and the SEC to avoid the exchange\u2019s assets being frozen, while Gemini is seeking to expand operations beyond U.S. authorities\u2019 reach.\n\nThis week\u2019s Crypto Biz looks at the wave of applications for a Bitcoin spot ETF, the most recent centralized exchange (CEX) launch in the U.S., and CleanSpark\u2019s aggressive mining expansion despite the bear market.\n\nWall Street giants back EDX Markets, a new cryptocurrency exchange\n\nThe U.S. crypto industry has a new player: EDX Markets. The new CEX made a notable entry with backing from prominent financial institutions such as Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments, Paradigm, Sequoia Capital and Charles Schwab. Currently, the exchange supports trading only four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). In the coming months, EDX plans to introduce EDX Clearing, a clearinghouse to settle trades executed on the EDX Markets platform.\n\nBlackrock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF renews optimism, sparks wave of new filings\n\nAt least three investment firms have filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs following investment goliath BlackRock\u2019s move to lodge a similar application on June 15. Asset management fund WisdomTree is seeking permission from the SEC to list its \u201cWisdomTree Bitcoin Trust\u201d for a third time. Less than four hours after the WisdomTree filing, global investment manager Invesco \u201creactivated\u201d its application for a similar product, followed by a request from Valkyrie Investments on June 21. Moreover, rumors have begun circulating that the multitrillion-dollar fund manager Fidelity Investments may also be looking to capitalize on the newfound frenzy for spot Bitcoin ETFs. While the SEC has not yet approved a single spot Bitcoin ETF product, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that \u201cBlackRock breathed new life into the race.\u201d\n\nWisdomTree has filed for spot bitcoin ETF h/t @NateGeraci pic.twitter.com/JwXj8rTs2X \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 20, 2023\n\nCleanSpark buys two Bitcoin mining campuses for $9.3 million\n\nCrypto mining firm CleanSpark continues its aggressive infrastructure expansion in the U.S. by acquiring two Bitcoin mining facilities in a $9.3 million cash deal. The facilities will host over 6,000 Antminer S19 XPs and S19J Pro+s, which are expected to add about one exahash per second (EH/s) to CleanSpark\u2019s hash rate following the deal\u2019s completion. According to Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, the newly acquired infrastructure will enable the company to reach its target of 16 EH/s by the end of 2023. The purchase follows several other acquisitions by CleanSpark in recent months, despite a slump in BTC mining profitability during the bear market.\n\nGemini plans Asia-Pacific expansion as part of \u201cnext wave of growth for crypto\u201d\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Gemini has announced plans to expand into the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region by increasing the staff at the firm\u2019s Singapore office and establishing an engineering division in India. In a blog post, Gemini hinted at \u201clarger\u201d plans for expanding into the region in the next 12 months. \u201cWe believe that APAC will be a great driver of the next wave of growth for crypto and Gemini,\u201d said the exchange. Gemini seemed to be exploring different markets amid the crackdown on many crypto firms in the United States. In April, the exchange took the first steps to become a restricted dealer with Canada\u2019s Ontario Securities Commission. Last month, it chose Ireland as a base to grow the firm\u2019s services across Europe.\n\n1/ We\u2019re expanding in the Asia Pacific region!\n\n\n\nOur Singapore office will serve as a hub for our larger APAC operations and we plan to increase our headcount to 100+ in Singapore pic.twitter.com/4fo06cKiLb \u2014 Gemini (@Gemini) June 20, 2023\n\nBefore you go: Bitcoin hits $28,000 after BlackRock files for BTC ETF\n\nIn the latest episode of The Market Report, Cointelegraph analyst and writer Marcel Pechman explains what\u2019s behind Bitcoin reaching 50% crypto market dominance for the first time in two years amid Blackrock\u2019s spot ETF filing and the U.S. SEC\u2019s crackdown on altcoins.

        "title": "Bitcoin rallies 17% this week as institutional interest in the asset picks up - CNBC",
        "content": "For many crypto investors, this week felt like the beginning of a new era \u2013 and ironically, it was driven by the old guard of financial institutions. Bitcoin ended the week up 17.1% at $30,864.67, according to Coin Metrics, for its best week since March 17. At one point on Friday, bitcoin rose to as much as $31,412.72 , its highest level since June 8, 2022. In altcoins: the tokens tied to Solana and Cardano gained roughly 12% this week, while Polygon advanced more than 13%, as of Friday evening. These are the same tokens that were under pressure earlier this month after the Securities and Exchange Commission referred to them as crypto asset securities in lawsuits brought against the biggest exchanges \u2013 Binance and Coinbase . Meanwhile, each of the major averages posted their worst weekly performance since March. The S & P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite fell three our of four trading days this week, with the Nasdaq snapping an eight-week winning streak. \"Amid strengthening regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, bitcoin was hoisted above $30k as a number of TradFi [traditional finance] players have followed BlackRock's move to file for spot bitcoin exchange traded funds this week,\" said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank. BlackRock filed an application for its spot bitcoin ETF June 15, spurring a flurry of fund filings from other asset managers. In this holiday-shortened week alone, institutions like WisdomTree and Invesco have filed or refreshed bitcoin ETF applications . BTC.CM= 5D mountain Bitcoin this week Meanwhile, an institutional-only crypto exchange called EDX Markets, backed by Fidelity Digital Assets, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities, announced that it has gone live with bitcoin and ether trading. And finally, JPMorgan confirmed to CNBC's \"Crypto World\" that it began allowing euro-denominated payments for corporate clients to make wholesale payments using its JPM Coin . This week's price action brings bitcoin's year-to-date gains to about 85% and advanced the cryptocurrency nearly 8% for the quarter, as of Friday evening. Still, for crypto, the period since the end of this year's banking crisis has been marked by low trading volume, even as it's moved in a positive direction recently. In the past two weeks, bitcoin's trading volume has increased 0.5% on a week-over-week basis, according to JPMorgan. That contrast could mean bitcoin hasn't attracted new money or investors into the crypto market, according to Owen Lau, an analyst at Oppenheimer. With a lot of good priced in this week, don't be surprised to see a minor pullback in the week ahead, Lau said. There isn't much on the calendar in the coming days, and investors \"may just sell the strength and wait for the next catalyst.\" From a technical point of view, Hasegawa said bitcoin's breakout \"from the two-month long descending channel is a bullish sign, especially since bitcoin's trading volume has noticeably increased, but from a macro perspective, a continued cash inflow may not be likely.\" \"Bitcoin may be able to print another leg up to around $32,000 in the short term due to technical reasons, but it feels like the current recovery has a short expiration date,\" he added."

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThe recovery that began last week\u2014after U.S. inflation appeared to cool\u2014hit its stride this week as markets continued to reverberate from the bombshell of the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, filing an application to the SEC for a Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nDozens of companies apply for ETFs, and dozens have been rejected. To date, not a single Bitcoin spot ETF has been approved by the crypto-skeptic SEC, despite the fact that Canadian regulators have approved many of them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe stakes are high: a spot ETF would offer investors the chance to buy into Bitcoin and either ride the gravy train or go to hell in a hand basket, but if the latter, they\u2019ll be safe in the knowledge that their investment is protected, unlike those who purchase and store crypto directly.\n\nIf anybody has a chance of getting an ETF approved, it\u2019s BlackRock. The firm boasts an incredible $9 trillion in assets under management and has a winning score of 575-1 when it comes to getting an ETF approved by the SEC.\n\nThe news inspired two more U.S. asset managers, WisdomTree and Invesco, which have both previously applied for their own ETFs\u2014to file fresh ETF applications this week. Valkyrie followed suit shortly after.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETC) both surged this week. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency shot up 18% to its current price of $30,687, while the biggest runner up rallied 12.7% to trade at $1,893 at the start of the weekend.\n\nInvestors flooded into other cryptocurrencies this week as well. In fact, most of the top thirty cryptocurrencies by market cap shot up by double-digit percentages. There were no losses among the major unbacked coins.\n\nBitcoin fork Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ballooned a staggering 80.5% over the last seven days and currently trades for $192.90.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRegulation and expansion\n\nWhile all eyes were on the SEC and big asset managers this week, there were a couple of other stories that indicated the steady adoption of crypto is continuing around the world.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) trial project backed by the Bank of England published its findings, concluding that a centrally-issued sterling-pegged digital currency could \u201cenable a robust ecosystem to foster innovation, and to help meet the future needs of a more digitalised society.\u201d\n\nThe project\u2014dubbed Project Rosalind\u2014emphasized the programmability of crypto through smart contracts, which facilitate automatic payments and enable new kinds of online transactions.\n\nOn Monday, British parliamentarians in the House of Lords (upper chamber) voted through the Financial Services and Markets Bill, a piece of legislation that proposes regulation for stablecoins, crypto and crypto promotion.\n\nThe bill has already passed the House of Commons and has made it through to the final stages: the Consideration of Amendments, where both chambers debate the proposals and tighten the screws until they both agree. The final stage requires a signature from King Charlie himself.\n\nIt was reported on Tuesday that Germany\u2019s largest bank, Deutsche Bank, applied for a digital asset custody platform license with the German finance regulator, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).\n\nDuring a semiannual hearing on monetary policy held by the Republican-led House Financial Services Committee and led by Patrick McHenry (R-NC) on Wednesday, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank should play a \u201crobust federal role\u201d in crypto regulation and added that Bitcoin has \u201cstaying power\u201d while implying the same about stablecoins.\n\nFinally, XRP progenitor Ripple was granted an in-principle payments license in Singapore. Ripple has long felt heat from U.S. regulators. A lawsuit against it by the SEC has been ongoing since 2020 and, like Coinbase, the company is now hedging its bets through global expansion.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

In May and June, respectively, Valkyrie applied with the SEC for listing its own leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF as well as a spot BTC ETF.\n\nThe filing came amid the SEC being entrenched in lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase for alleged unregistered securities offerings.

There are 150 teams or cars. It starts in Hamburg and goes up to Denmark, Sweden, Norway and around the Baltic Sea. It\u2019s around 8,000 kilometers, 16 days, and we\u2019re the only Bitcoin team here \u2014 none of the other teams are cryptocurrency teams.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to \u201cbring Bitcoin to the people\u201d while also raising money for two sources: a Panamanian coffee farmer and a Salvadoran peer-to-peer ride-sharing app developed on the Lightning Network.

Plus, passersby and overtakers can scan the QR code on the side of the car to receive free satoshis, or small amounts of Bitcoin, to get started on their Bitcoin journey.\n\n\u201cSo, when somebody sees us and asks about Bitcoin \u2014 \u2018How does it work?\u2019 \u2014 we can actually take the people to our car and say, \u2018Okay, just install a wallet and it\u2019s done in about 30 seconds.\u2019 And they\u2019re amazed: \u2018I didn\u2019t have to fill out anything, didn\u2019t have to take a passport or whatever. It just works.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe car is also equipped with a candy machine that accepts Bitcoin, so newbies can spend their brand-new sats on candy, \u201cjust to see how it works,\u201d Cercatrova explained.\n\nThe team's location in northern Norway. Source: Superlative Adventure Club\n\nFor the Bitcoin enthusiasts following at home, the car is Lightning-ready. A remote-play jukebox and a Lightning-switch horn can be operated from all around the world.

The process uses a Lightning switch that turns on when it has received enough sats. Cercatrova explains:\n\n\u201cOn my Twitter feed is also the QR code, where you can scan the Lightning invoice. And when you pay that, it\u2019s about 3,000 sats to honk it once. And then our car honks!\u201d\n\nThe honk is comically loud and playful, while the Lightning jukebox playlist has featured music ranging from metal to Mozart and German folk tunes to crypto classics such as \u201cPump It Up.\u201d Cercatrova explained that the musical variation is a great source of fun and motivation:\n\n\u201cOne time there is death metal, and the other side it\u2019s Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony, and it\u2019s really crazy.\u201d\n\nTo date, the Bitcoin Ambassadors rally team has raised approximately 4 million satoshis ($1,200) for charity, although Cercatrova added that \u201cthe next days and the willingness to send more sats\u201d could drive the number higher. The drivers are about halfway through the journey, expecting to finish by the end of June.\n\nRelated: Wen Lambo fixed?

        "title": "Lightning Network's new partnership will boost Bitcoin adoption in Mexico - Forbes India",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nThe recently concluded Bitcoin 2023 Conference in Miami, Florida, witnessed an exciting announcement that has the potential to impact Mexico's economy significantly. CEO of Ibex Mercado, Jose Lemus, took the stage to unveil a groundbreaking collaboration with Grupo Salinas, one of Mexico's largest corporate conglomerates. This partnership aims to revolutionise how millions of Mexicans pay their internet bills by introducing the Bitcoin Lightning Network.\n\n\n\nThe significance of this collaboration lies in the fact that Grupo Salinas owns numerous businesses across Mexico, and its founder, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, is not only a billionaire but also a well-known Bitcoin advocate. With such influential backing, the partnership drives widespread Bitcoin adoption among Mexicans.\n\nLemus emphasised that this is just the beginning, envisioning a future where other major entities within the Salinas conglomerate, such as Best Buy, Bank of America, Fox News, and even an NFL team, embrace the Lightning Network's capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nLemus believes that the collaboration between Ibex Mercado and Grupo Salinas represents a fundamental step towards realising the full potential of the Lightning Network. The plans go beyond enabling Bitcoin payments for internet bills; they involve developing Lightning apps for employees and soccer teams, drawing inspiration from the successful Bitcoin initiatives implemented by the Australian baseball team, Perth Heat, in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nIbex Mercado recognises the tremendous potential for financial inclusion the Lightning Network offers. In the past, the company successfully integrated the Lightning Network for El Salvador's Chivo Wallet, providing millions of Salvadorans with access to essential banking services. By expanding Bitcoin adoption in Mexico, Lemus aims to go beyond basic banking services and empower unbanked and underserved populations, opening up new avenues for raising funds for companies and accessing broader markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile living entirely on Bitcoin in Mexico may still take some time, Lemus suggests that within approximately 18 months, conducting most daily activities with the crypto could become feasible. However, certain aspects may still require traditional fiat transactions. The collaboration between Ibex Mercado and Grupo Salinas, which has been in the making for 18 months, is just the beginning. Lemus hints at more partnerships and projects for Mexico's Bitcoin landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\nMexico's increasing interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption, evident through establishing crypto remittance companies and expanding crypto exchanges, positions the country at the forefront of a digital revolution. With Jose Lemus's vision and key players' collaborative efforts, Mexico is poised to shape its economic landscape by embracing the transformative power of digital currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia. He ventured into crypto in 2013 and is an ETH maximalist. Twitter: @bhardwajshash"

        "content": "Renowned television personality and esteemed host of the popular show \u201cMad Money,\u201d Jim Cramer, has emerged as a prominent critic of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a bold statement made on January 9, Cramer advised his audience that the current climate presented a \u201cgood chance again to get out of crypto,\u201d specifically referencing Bitcoin\u2019s trading value at $17,093.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that since Cramer\u2019s cautionary declaration, the flagship digital asset has experienced a remarkable surge, presently trading at $30,020\u2014an impressive 75% increase.\n\nBitcoin is up 75% since January 9. Source: CramerTracker\n\nYear-to-date, BTC soared by more than 80%. Remarkably, over the past week alone, Bitcoin has surged by an impressive 17%, exemplifying its resolute upward trajectory. The cryptocurrency\u2019s value soared from $25,500 to above $30,000, resulting in a substantial boost of $80 billion to its market capitalization.\n\nSuch overwhelming Bitcoin ETF interest from esteemed institutional investors like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), Invesco, and WisdomTree has undoubtedly contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge, further reinforcing its position as a digital asset of immense significance.\n\nCramer issues caution in March\n\nBack in March, Cramer expressed his belief that Bitcoin is an enigmatic entity subject to manipulation, pointing to Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s alleged involvement in its manipulation.\n\nWith an air of skepticism, he cautioned against assuming that such manipulation had ceased, stating, \u201cI think it is being manipulated up. It was being manipulated the whole time by Sam Bankman-Fried, so please don\u2019t assume, therefore, that it\u2019s not still being manipulated.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMad Money\u201d host later advised:\n\n\u201cI would sell my Bitcoin right into this rally. And believe me, I had been a believer in Bitcoin at one time. But not here, not now.\u201d\n\nCramer continued his critique by advocating for selling Bitcoin amidst its ongoing rally, disassociating himself from his previous belief in the cryptocurrency.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Kennedy Jr., presidential candidate for the Democratic Party, spoke to The New York Post yesterday about several of his views regarding cryptocurrency, central bank digital currencies, and AI, among other topics.\n\nThe 69-year old has not shied away from controversy, nor addressing views that might not be aligned with mainstream narratives. One such topic: Bitcoin.\n\nReporter Lydia Moynihan asked what Kennedy\u2019s \u201ccrypto policy\u201d was going to be, were he to be elected.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI will make sure that we have policies that support Bitcoin and the freedom to transact,\u201d said Kennedy, \u201cand that allow individuals to manage their own Bitcoin wallets, nodes, and passwords.\u201d He added that he will \u201conly allow the narrowest controls that are necessary to prevent money laundering.\u201d\n\nKennedy made headlines this year during his keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami. On that occasion he took a swing at Biden\u2019s proposed 30% crypto tax as well as denouncing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\nThe miner tax was blocked in the deal legislators signed to raise the debt ceiling in May. But CBDCs are still very much a point of contention among U.S. politicians. Several prominent public figures are openly opposed to these technologies, including Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis.\n\nAnd it turns out Kennedy still agrees with his potential opponent.\n\nIn today\u2019s interview with The New York Post, Kennedy touched upon the concern, claiming he opposes central bank digital currencies because they are \"instruments of control and oppression, and are certain to be abused.\u201d The sentiment echoes previous remarks, when he decried a \u201cwar on crypto,\u201d earlier this year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKennedy also has ideas surrounding artificial intelligence. According to him, AI needs to be regulated globally. He pointed to tech leaders who have sounded alarms about the threats posed by AI\u2014namely Elon Musk, who he said he likes because Tesla\u2019s CEO \u201cfavors free speech.\u201d\n\nKennedy didn\u2019t hold back, highlighting what he sees as potential dangers, including AI\u2019s \u201ccapacity to control narratives, create illusions, surveil our activities to dictate our behaviors and enforce compliance, and ultimately enslave humanity.\u201d\n\nAs of writing, according to opinion poll website FiveThirtyEight, Kennedy trails Biden by roughly 58 percentage points in the Democratic Party presidential primary."

        "content": "A majority of the top crypto tokens dropped sharply during the early day on Friday on the back of profit booking. Traders remain concerned about the US SEC lawsuits filed against exchange powerhouses Binance and Coinbase, despite spot Bitcoin ETF filings with the US market regulator by three financial giants.\n\nBitcoin saw some profit booking after the gains of two days as the largest crypto token dropped about a per cent but managed to hold $30,000-mark. Its largest peer, Ethereum, was also trading lower and dropped about 2 per cent to slip below the $1,900-level. However, pain in the other altcoins was severe.\n\nMarkets have slipped after a three-day rally. The crypto fear and greed index has registered no movement. Bitcoins price is beginning to stall after the BTC ETF excitement within the market. Though we can expect the BTC price to hold firmly around the current levels with support at $29,700, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\"Institutional entry into the crypto market has shifted the narrative and investor sentiment away from regulatory developments from last week. Furthering this case, French regulators have granted registration to CACEIS, the asset servicing division of banking giants Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Santander, allowing them to provide crypto custody services,\" he said.\n\nBarring the US dollar-pegged stablecoins, all other top crypto tokens were trading lower on Friday. BNB dropped about 5 per cent, while Solana and XRP declined 4 per cent. Dogecoin and Polygon shed 3 per cent each. Litecoin, Cardano and Shina Inu were other laggards.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading significantly lower, falling to $1.17 trillion-mark as it dropped more than a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes plunged more than 32 per cent to $40.41 billion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has surged to over $30,000 for the first time in two months after recent filing of multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications. The surge came after the recent filing of spot bitcoin ETF applications by BlackRock, Invesco, and other large asset management firms has given investors hope that the crypto market is starting to recover, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"Spot bitcoin ETFs are designed to track the price of bitcoin directly, and their approval would allow investors to buy and sell bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. The recent developments could help to stabilize the crypto market and pave the way for further growth in the future,\" it said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nEthereum has retraced some gains from earlier this week. The ETH/USD pair is currently attempting a rebound after failing to break the $1,950 resistance level. After a period of corrections and consolidations, ETH has started showing signs of appreciation by breaking out of its descending channel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe asset is currently trading above its 100-day moving average of $1,844 which acts as an immediate support level. The RSI reading is currently at 58, slightly in overbought territory. If ETH is unable to break through the $1,900 barrier this week, the price may consolidate around $1,850 levels for a while.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $1,845, $1,795\n\nResistance: $1,900, $1,950\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin has gained over 17 per cent in the last seven days. Ethereum, the second largest crypto coin as per market cap, was up over 12 per cent.\n\nOn Friday, Bitcoin and Ethereum were trading at $30,023 and $1,876 respectively. Cardano, Solana, Litecoinand Polkadot also registered double-digit gains in the last week.\n\n\"The surge comes after the recent filing of spot bitcoin ETF applications by BlackRock, Invesco, and other large asset management firms has given investors hope that the crypto market is starting to recover,\" the research team of crypto exchange CoinDCX told Business Standard.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs are designed to track the price of bitcoin directly, and their approval would allow investors to buy and sell bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts.\n\nAccording to Edul Patel, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of crypto platform Mudrex, Deutsche Bank's announcement of applying for crypto custody services in Germany also played a role in boosting the investors' confidence in the industry.\n\n\"Bitcoin has crossed the $30,000.01 mark, demonstrating its stability and resilience in the face of market fluctuations,\" said Shivam Thakral, CEO of crypto exchange BuyUcoin.\n\nThe SEC approval of BlackRock's application may take months and is still uncertain but according to Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, the timeline is overlapping with the scheduled date of Bitcoin's halving and is keeping investors motivated. The largest crypto token is expected to be halved in April 2024.\n\n\"The institutions have finally arrived big time, and BTC is of particular interest in all these developments, given that there is some clarity on its classification as a commodity. Even though the SEC approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF is still months away (and uncertain), the timeline overlapping with BTC Halving in April 2024 is really building the 'bull case' for Bitcoin prices. This is also being manifested in Bitcoin's rising dominance of overall crypto markets,\" he said.\n\nAfter the network mines 210,000 blocks\u2014roughly every four years\u2014the block reward given to Bitcoin miners for processing transactions is cut in half, it is called Bitcoin halving.\n\nIt cuts the rate at which new bitcoins are released into circulation in half. This usually results in the price of the token going up immediately. The last halving took place on May 11, 2020.\n\nHowever, experts also said that to maintain the bull run, Bitcoin will need to maintain its position.\n\n\"To maintain its positive momentum and reach new annual highs, Bitcoin needs to solidify its position above the critical level of $30,000,\" Patel said."

Notably, the exchange listed four tokens, Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, garnering the attention of crypto investors.\n\nAlso, the crypto trading platform derives support from Charles Schwab, a top US-based investment advisor and brokerage firm, Fidelity Investments, and Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel Securities.\n\nThe exchange also announced new investors, including DV Crypto, GTS, Miami International Holdings, GSR Markets LTD, and HRT Technology. And participants in the space believe the launch of EDX would facilitate institutional investments in crypto.\n\nBitcoin Cash\u2019s price rally stems from EDX\u2019s launch as one of the cryptocurrencies listed on the exchange. The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s view that most Proof-of-Stake network tokens are securities also drew attention to BCH. As such, the token has been rising in the last seven days.\n\nAs of Thursday, June 22, Bitcoin Cash closed with a 26.54% price gain after opening the day at $136.31. With the continued momentum, the token now trades at $143.22. Also, the hype around BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Invesco\u2019s spot BTC ETF application has influenced Bitcoin Cash\u2019s price action.\n\nIt bears mentioning that the approval of these spot ETF applications could facilitate Bitcoin\u2019s legitimacy and boost institutional interest.\n\nBitcoin Cash Analysis Using Technical Oscillators\n\nAs of the time of analysis, Bitcoin Cash is trading above the Bollinger Bands indicator, which signifies that the asset\u2019s price has surpassed its usual volatility range. This metric could imply strong upward momentum or a potential breakout.\n\nTraders may view this as a bullish signal, indicating a potential continuation of the upward trend and possibly considering new buying opportunities. Also, the asset\u2019s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is trading above its signal line, with the histogram bars displaying long green candles.\n\nRelated Reading: Conflux Claims Its Place Among Top Altcoins As CFX Price Skyrockets 46%\n\nThe position confirms the bullish momentum presented in Bitcoin Cash\u2019s price, indicating a potential uptrend and long positions.\n\nThe asset currently trades between its primary support and resistance levels of $104.72 and $148.55, respectively.

        "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Finds Support at $30K? Tradecurve Shows Bullish Patterns - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In this article, we delve into the current market conditions and examine the possibility of Bitcoin finding support at $30,000. Alongside this analysis, we explore the emerging platform, Tradecurve, which has been showing a bullish trajectory during the ongoing presale event. Let\u2019s start with the current conditions in the market.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCan Bitcoin (BTC) Find Support at $26K\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are experiencing significant pressure following a series of regulatory announcements this week. Consequently, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has stabilized below the critical 200-week moving average, reflecting market uncertainty in the face of these regulatory developments.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) fell to a daily low of $30,000, which marked an increase of more than $1,200 from the previous day\u2019s high. The good news is that the price has since pumped back up to above $31k \u2014 but can Bitcoin (BTC) hold and find support at this level?\n\nEven though Bitcoin (BTC) has demonstrated a certain degree of vulnerability, it hasn\u2019t been hit as hard as some major alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). This divergence can be attributed to the heavy impact on altcoins following the delisting that occurred in response to legal action taken by U.S. regulators against significant cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nAs of now, the 200-week MA for Bitcoin is at approximately $31,185.77. If Bitcoin (BTC) fails to maintain this level, it could suggest a bear market for the entire crypto space. This shows the importance of Bitcoin (BTC) holding steady above $30K.\n\nWhile the SEC investigation is bad news for the crypto space and proof-of-stake coins, Bitcoin (BTC) is a different beast altogether. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin (BTC) means that no single entity can influence the market.\n\nBullish analysts note that Bitcoin (BTC) is above a number of support zones. Most notable is the $24K price level, which has acted as significant support and resistance since 2020. It will take a lot of bearish pressure to break below this level.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nTradecurve Shows Bullish Patterns\n\nTradecurve is shaping up to be a comprehensive trading platform that offers a myriad of trading possibilities all in one place. Users can delve into trading cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, and forex without the hassle of navigating multiple platforms.\n\nGetting started with Tradecurve is straightforward, freeing users from the often tedious and time-consuming paperwork and identity checks typical in the trading industry. With just an email address, users can set up an account and begin trading using their selected cryptocurrency.\n\nIn terms of advanced features, Tradecurve provides algorithmic trading where AI oversees your trades, copy trading that enables you to replicate the tactics of successful traders, and even a training academy set in the metaverse.\n\n>>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW<<\n\nThe TCRV token, native to the Tradecurve platform, allows users to tap into exclusive benefits and rewards. These include trading fee discounts, the opportunity to earn passive income by providing liquidity, and the ability to unlock VIP bonuses.\n\nTradecurve, with its emphasis on simplicity, effectiveness, and affordability, has the potential to transform the trillion-dollar trading landscape. Traders no longer have to endure cumbersome KYC requirements and high fees to gain access to a world of trading opportunities.\n\nAt present, Tradecurve (TCRV) is conducting a presale of discounted TCRV tokens, with the third phase soon coming to a close. The current token price of $0.018 marks a 80% gain since the start of the presale.\n\nBut this could be just the start of the bullish run \u2014 as Tradecurve sets its sights on major players like Binance, analysts predict a remarkable surge in the TCRV token value by up to 100 times.\n\nVisit the links below to learn more about the TCRV presale and Tradecurve:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nClick Here To Buy TCRV Presale Tokens\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin Resurges with Highest Market Dominance in Two Years: Is $40,000 on the Horizon? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "What a week it has been for the flagship coin of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin (BTC) has seen close to 17% growth in the last 7 days as it soared past the 30k barrier. Everything seems to be falling in place for BTC as it also reached 50% market dominance for the first time since 2021.\n\nBack then Bitcoin was trading in the 70,000 range at its highest ever price so does that mean we could see it return to that price range? That may be a little ambitious but 40k, which seemed unbreakable for most of 2023, now looks like it is in its sights.\n\nWhat is good for bitcoin is good for the market and we have seen conditions pick up. This means it is the perfect time to get involved with projects like Wall Street Memes ($WSM), DeeLance (DLANCE), Ecoterra (ECOTERRA), Launchpad XYZ (LPX), yPredict (YPRED), Copium Coin ($COPIUM), and Spongebob Token ($SPIONGE) which are all great low-cap options that can pump during a bullish market.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at Bitcoin\u2019s future possibilities.\n\n>>>Buy the Best Crypto Now<<<\n\n40k could soon be in Bitcoins rearview mirror\n\nBitcoins (BTC) market dominance likely comes after the SEC lawsuit announcements against Bincnace and Coinbase. The lawsuit mentioned a number of altcoins that were not classified as securities actually were, this effectively weakened a lot of crypto\u2019s number one coin competition.\n\nNot only that but now we have news that Blackrock is filing with the SEC for an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These requests have previously been blocked by the SEC but no asset manager with the power of Blackrock has previously sought one.\n\nIt is probably not a coincidence that Deutsche Bank is making attempts to enter the digital token exchange platform market either. These are huge nods towards the legitimacy of crypto and that has caused Bitcoin to really take off. We think this news is the trigger the market needs and expect Bitcoin to soar past 40k soon.\n\nNow that the market\u2019s arrow is pointing upwards let\u2019s take a look at some other great investment opportunities.\n\n>>>Buy the Best Crypto Now<<<\n\nWall Street Memes- The meme coin likely to pump no matter the conditions\n\nWhile a bullish market is great news of course it actually likely isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all for Wall Street Memes ($WSM). Meme coins tend to operate in their own orbit and with the community $WSM already has built we can see it pumping no matter what.\n\nThey bring over 1 million followers from their social media accounts to the crypto market and we all know the positive effect a community can have on a meme coin\u2019s price. The presale has already surpassed $9 million so the hype seems to be real.\n\n>>>Buy Wall Street Memes Now<<<\n\nDeeLance- Web 3.0 technology that will revolutionize the gig economy\n\nWe love projects that realize injecting Web 3.0 into an existing service can vastly improve it, and that is what we have with DeeLance (DLANCE). They have noticed both the explosion in the gig economy and the fact the sites that connect freelancers and employers are no longer fit for purpose.\n\nThrough their decentralized platform they will be able to improve on a lot of things like payment disputes and ownership issues but what stands out is the lower fees. Thanks to their peer-to-peer payment system they will be able to charge less than legacy sites which we think freelancers especially will love.\n\n>>> Buy DeeLance Now<<<\n\nEcoterra- Help the environment and fill your wallet\n\nGreen cryptos will likely become one of the most profitable genres of crypto in the future. So, getting on board with projects like Ecottera (ECOTERRA) now will likely prove the right decision in the long run. The project has real-world benefits for the environment unlike many of its rivals.\n\nInvestors will just need to go to their partner supermarkets with their recyclables, scan them using the Ecoterra app, and deposit them in the supplied reverse vending machines and they will be able to earn native currency.\n\n>>> Buy Ecoterra Now<<<\n\nLaunchpad XYZ- Go from Web 3.0 rookie to expert with this platform\n\nWeb 3.0 is taking over the crypto sphere, every project\u2019s whitepaper you read seems to have a section dedicated to how they are utilizing it for their project. Launchpad XYZ has realized there is a market for onboarding users to Web 3.0 because not everyone can be an expert in a new technology.\n\nIn fact, they aim to onboard the next 10 million users to the technology. These are very ambitious numbers but even if they hit a small percentage of their goal it makes it a project worth investing in.\n\n>>> Buy Launchpad XYZ Now<<<\n\nyPredict- Over 20,000 users are already on the waiting list to use this platform\n\nThose are very impressive numbers and the presale has started to reflect that. The $2.5 million raised mark has now been passed by yPredict (YPRED) after initially having a slow start. But why are over 20,000 people already signed up to use this platform?\n\nWell, yPredict will be a trading platform that hosts the top 1% of AI developers who will be supplying their trading formulas to investors. Simply purchase YPRED for the raw data or a subscription for the algorithm and you can have access to the market\u2019s best trading strategies.\n\n>>> Buy yPredict Now<<<\n\nSpongebob Token- A possible successor to PEPE\u2019s throne?\n\nEvery meme coin is hoping to replicate the success that Pepe Coin had. Well, not many coins have come as close as Spongebob Token ($SPONGE). It pumped by 1200% before it had the bad luck of hitting a bear market and losing its gains. It is, however, a meme the internet loves and with its previous form, it is a good buy-low option.\n\n>>> Buy SpongeBob Token Now<<<\n\nCopium Coin- Pumped by 73% after listings begun\n\nCopium Coin ($COPIUM) is a meme coin with a difference. Its presale was invite only which was very clever as the invites were given to those that interacted on social media which of course builds a profile. Then, each user could only buy a maximum of 1ETH worth of $COPIUM to secure against a future rug pull.\n\nThe presale tactic seems to have been a success as the coin has been volatile since launched but hasn\u2019t dipped below its original listing price. It has hit a high of 73% gains and looks worth a look thanks to its unique approach.\n\n>>> Buy $COPIUM Here<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nSo to conclude, Bitcoin looks like it has a real chance to soar past 40k thanks to some great market conditions that have fallen in place for the project. While the market is green the 7 coins we have mentioned above are also worth investing in. Their low market cap means they have limited potential and it also takes a lot of the risk away from you, the investor.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "10 Interesting Facts About Bitcoin Mining - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "For readers interested in cryptocurrency, here are 10 interesting facts about Bitcoin mining\n\nBy creating a cryptographic solution that meets specific requirements, bitcoin mining confirms the data in a blockchain block. The miner who found the answer first receives a reward through Bitcoin and fees for their labor when a proper solution is found. For the Bitcoin network to be secure and to produce new bitcoins, bitcoin mining is necessary. Hash cash, a unique technique used in Bitcoin mining, necessitates using electricity and processing resources from miners to solve challenging mathematical problems.\n\nGenesis Block:\n\nThe first Bitcoin block to be mined is known as the Genesis Block. On January 3, 2009, Bitcoin\u2019s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto invented it. The Genesis Block is the model for all subsequent blocks in the network and serves as the basis of the Bitcoin blockchain. There is just one transaction in the Genesis Block, and Nakamoto received 50 bitcoins as payment.\n\nMining in Space:\n\nAsteroids and other minor planets are mined for their precious raw resources, which include iron, nickel, titanium, gold, platinum, and water. Space mining might be utilized to get building materials for use in orbit or on Earth and use asteroids that pose a hazard to the planet. Reaching, identifying, removing, and assessing the minerals on asteroids are only a few of the difficulties in mining in space.\n\nBitcoin Mining Dominance:\n\nThe level of a country or region\u2019s contribution to the overall computing power in the Bitcoin network is known as its \u201cmining dominance.\u201d Dominance in Bitcoin mining can reveal where miners are located geographically and how much impact they may have on the network\u2019s security and governance.\n\nMining\u2019s Environmental Impact:\n\nMining operations\u2019 effect on the environment and public health is known as the environmental impact of mining. Ecological issues related to mining include the Erosion of exposed hillside areas, mine dumps, tailings dams, and the ensuing siltation of drainages, streams, and rivers. This may impact the availability and quality of water for plant and animal life: dust, particle debris, gases, and fumes from mining processing processes.\n\nMining Malware:\n\nMalicious software known as \u201cmining malware\u201d uses the victim\u2019s device to mine cryptocurrency without their knowledge or agreement. Malware for mining may infect servers, IoT devices, smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and more. Mining malware can adversely affect a device\u2019s performance, security, and life since it uses CPU and hardware resources, consumes more energy, and leaves the device open to various dangers.\n\nWaste Heat Utilization:\n\nThe process of utilizing surplus heat produced by industrial operations or other sources for beneficial reasons, such as electricity production, heating, cooling, or dehumidification, is known as waste heat utilization. Utilizing waste heat may help companies become more environmentally friendly and energy efficient by lowering fuel usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMining Pools:\n\nCryptocurrency miners form mining pools to maximize their chances of finding new blocks and earning coins and agree to share their processing power and incentives. Mining pools may be helpful for miners with minimal hardware resources or who find solo mining very challenging. Additionally, mining pools can lessen the variation and luck associated with the mining process and give miners a more steady and constant revenue.\n\nHalving Events:\n\nThe reward for mining new blocks is halved in several cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin, when this happens. By reducing the rate at which new coins enter circulation, halving events aim to regulate both the inflation rate and the overall supply of the cryptocurrency. The incentives and profitability of miners, who supply the network with computer power and security, are likewise impacted by halving occurrences. Halving occurrences are predefined and programmed into the Bitcoin system.\n\nBlock Rewards:\n\nThe incentives that Bitcoin miners earn for approving and uploading fresh blocks of transactions to the blockchain are known as block rewards. The native cryptocurrency of the network, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, is typically used to pay out block rewards. Block rewards have two primary functions: they generate new currency and safeguard the network by encouraging miners to engage and compete. The supply and demand of cryptocurrencies and their price can be affected by changes in block rewards, such as halving events or protocol updates, which miners must also adjust to.\n\nMined Bitcoin Lost Forever:\n\nA phenomenon known as \u201cmined Bitcoin lost forever\u201d describes bitcoin that has been mined but is no longer accessible or recoverable for a variety of reasons, such as forgetting or losing the private keys, throwing away or destroying the devices that store the keys, passing away without passing on the keys, or sending bitcoin to invalid addresses. Mined Bitcoin that is permanently lost is effectively taken out of circulation and can never be used or transferred again.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "How to mine Bitcoin (BTC) - finder.com.au",
        "content": "Disclaimer: This information should not be interpreted as an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering. It is not a recommendation to trade.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin mining?\n\nBitcoin mining may seem intimidating, especially with its industry jargon. However, with a little bit of basic knowledge, this seemingly intimidating process can become much simpler.\n\nTo start, the word Bitcoin can be used to refer to 3 things:\n\nThe Bitcoin currency (BTC) The Bitcoin network The Bitcoin blockchain\n\nHowever, the 3 are fundamentally different and it's important to distinguish these differences to understand mining.\n\nThe best way to think of each of them is the following:\n\nThousands of people running computers make up the Bitcoin network. Each of these computers store the entire history of transactions that have taken place on the network in a special database. This is called the Bitcoin blockchain \u2013 2 names for these computers are Bitcoin miners or Bitcoin nodes. They are rewarded for their participation in securing the Bitcoin network and validating Bitcoin transactions. Rewards are in Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nAs the name suggests, the blockchain is a chain of blocks. Each block contains the latest set of transactions.\n\nNew blocks are created by Bitcoin miners. However, only 1 miner can create each new block. To ensure that only 1 miner creates a block, all miners must compete to solve a difficult mathematical problem. The difficulty of this problem is dynamically adjusted so that a block is created roughly (but reliably) about every 10 minutes. The miner that achieves a solution first gets to validate all transactions and create the new block. This is called proof-of-work (PoW). In return for their efforts, they are rewarded with brand new Bitcoin (BTC), plus the transaction fees from all transactions within the block. The reward is currently 6.25 Bitcoin per block.\n\nHow to mine Bitcoin in 5 steps\n\nThe first step is to determine profitability and viability of your Bitcoin mining operation. There are 2 major factors to consider when starting to mine Bitcoin. The hardware. Getting a hold of Bitcoin mining hardware can be tricky as there is tons of demand for these machines. The computers that mine Bitcoin are called ASICs or \"Application Specific Integrated Circuits\". You can buy them through many online retailers or order them straight from a manufacturer. The electricity. The profitability of your mining operation entirely depends on how much you are paying to run your miners. Even older generation Bitcoin mining rigs can be profitable as long as you're getting electricity for cheap enough. Before setting up your operation, use a mining profitability calculator to determine whether or not your set-up will be profitable. The second step is to actually acquire your Bitcoin mining hardware. You can buy Bitcoin mining \"rigs\" used or new from a supplier. When buying any hardware, you will want to take 2 factors into consideration. Locality. Where are the mining rigs going to be shipped from? You might get a good price on the machines, but then pay a lot of money to have them shipped to you. Explore your options and find the right balance. Condition of the miners. Used miners are a totally viable option, and are often good for individuals or businesses just getting started. Rather than paying top dollar for a new miner, a used miner can provide you with a similar experience. If you're buying used, make sure you are getting the rigs from a reputable source. The third step is to download Bitcoin mining software. Once you have a Bitcoin mining rig in place, your next step is to download the necessary software that will connect you to the Bitcoin blockchain. The software distributes work to miners and attempts to find blocks for the blockchain. There are several free software programs that can be used to mine Bitcoin, such as NiceHash Miner. The fourth step is to select and join a Bitcoin mining pool. It is difficult for individual miners to compete with large mining farms backed by mining companies. Luckily, there is a solution \u2013 Bitcoin mining pools. Individual miners can combine their computing power with a group to collectively compete. Fees must be paid to the operator of the pool and rewards are slightly lower, but using a mining pool will ensure rewards are more consistent. Start mining. Once you choose a pool, you are now ready to start mining Bitcoin. Connect your mining hardware to a power outlet, complete the connection to the Bitcoin blockchain with your chosen software, fill in your Bitcoin address for your rewards to be deposited to and you're good to go.\n\nHow much can a Bitcoin miner earn?\n\nWhile solo Bitcoin miners may find it difficult to profit from the venture, those that join Bitcoin mining pools are far more likely to bring in a return. However, how much a Bitcoin miner can earn depends on several variables.\n\nTo make a profit with Bitcoin mining, returns must be enough to cover the cost of electricity power, plus the initial investment for the mining equipment. To give themselves the best chance of success, Bitcoin miners focus on cheap electricity, high-efficiency hardware, and a good Bitcoin mining pool.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is the tax on the Bitcoin mined. It may not be guaranteed that a miner makes a profit, but depending on the jurisdiction, you may need to pay tax.\n\nFinally, the price of Bitcoin will ultimately determine how profitable a Bitcoin mining venture is. As mining equipment and electricity will be purchased in fiat currency, Bitcoin must maintain a high enough price for rewards to outweigh the costs.\n\nThe costs of mining Bitcoin\n\nWith increasing competition, the price for profitable Bitcoin mining equipment has increased considerably. As large mining farms drive up demand and dominate the Bitcoin mining space, mining rigs have had to become more powerful, which in turn increases the price. While some ASIC miners can start from $500, a professionally built mining rig can cost as much as $15,000. It is likely to take more than a year to recoup your initial investment.\n\nOnce a Bitcoin mining rig is in place, it then has to be powered. Ideally, the cost of electricity is low but if a Bitcoin mining rig is running every single day, costs can soon start to pile up. The cost of electricity will also vary from region to region within your respective country.\n\nAs previously discussed, to stand a chance of a return, every miner needs to mine Bitcoin through a Bitcoin mining pool. However, there is a cost to join a Bitcoin mining pool. The operator of each pool will charge a percentage for use of the network. These pool fees typically range from 0.1\u20132.5% and are removed from the mined Bitcoin.\n\nThe final cost to consider is the fee required when selling any Bitcoin. If a user's intention is to sell all Bitcoin that is mined, a fee will need to be paid to the cryptocurrency exchange or broker used to facilitate the transaction. These fees will vary between exchanges, and can sometimes be minimal, but should still be factored into the overall cost.\n\nIs Bitcoin cloud mining safe?\n\nCloud mining comes with its risks due to the propensity for cloud mining operations to be scams. There have been cloud mining operations set up that accept Bitcoin as payment, and pay out investors in Bitcoin. However, some of these operations are ponzi schemes, paying out early investors with the deposits of present investors.\n\nBe skeptical about the authenticity of the cloud mining operation if they are offering returns that seem unreasonable. It is useful to ask the following questions about the operation in the event that they are promising high returns: If they're getting such high returns, why do they need my money? Why don't they just mine the Bitcoin and keep it, rather than paying me a return for my investment?\n\nThat being said, there are safe Bitcoin cloud mining investment opportunities. Keep an eye on the returns that they are promising, as this is the best indication as to whether or not the opportunity is a scam.\n\nCompare crypto trading platforms\n\nFrequently asked questions about mining Bitcoin\n\nWill Bitcoin mining become less profitable or more difficult in the future? Yes. The number of Bitcoins generated per block halves every 210,000 blocks, which is roughly every 4 years. The current number of BTC awarded per block is 6.25, but this will halve around the year 2024. How much power do I need to mine Bitcoin? The amount of power needed to mine Bitcoin depends on the mining operation. The more miners in the operation, the more electricity is required to run them. Additional factors such as ventilation and cooling can drastically increase the amount of power that is required to power a mining operation. Can I mine cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin? Yes, there are many other Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies that can be mined, and most of them are more accessible to the average enthusiast than Bitcoin. Dogecoin and Litecoin are 2 examples of digital assets that can be mined. Can I mine Bitcoin on my phone? Any computer can mine Bitcoin, including a phone. However, unless you are using an \"ASIC\" (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) to mine Bitcoin, it is unlikely that the computer will be profitable. Do Bitcoin miners make money? Bitcoin miners do not always make money. It depends on how much power they use, and the cost of electricity to run them. In the case of high electricity costs, miners are unlikely to make money. How do beginners mine Bitcoin? Beginners can mine Bitcoin by getting their hands on second-hand mining equipment, or by simply instructing their desktop or laptop to mine. While neither case may be profitable, the experiment will give the beginner a rudimentary understanding of how mining works. How long does it take to mine 1 Bitcoin? The time it takes to mine 1 Bitcoin depends on a number of factors: The current block reward on the Bitcoin network The number of transactions and the fees paid on each of them in the blocks The amount of mining equipment in the mining operation Generally speaking, as time goes on, it will take longer and longer to mine 1 BTC. How much does it cost to mine 1 Bitcoin? The cost to mine 1 Bitcoin depends on a number of factors. The biggest contributing factor is how much a mining operation is paying for electricity. The higher the cost, the more it costs to mine 1 BTC. If the amount it costs to mine a Bitcoin exceeds the price of the Bitcoin, then the mining operation is mining Bitcoin at a loss. The other factors include the current block reward, and the amount of fees paid on each transaction in the blocks."

        "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Spikes To A 13-Month High, BCH Back To The Top-20 - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is one of the top-performing crypto assets this week after surging over 50% in the past five days to reach a four-month high. Trading at around $182 when writing on June 23, BCH is in the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. As it is, BCH is the 20th most valuable coin with a market capitalization of over $3.45 billion with a circulating supply of more than 19.42 million out of the 21 million.\n\nThe BCH surge also comes with a notable surge in open interest, signaling renewed investor interest in the altcoin that promises cheaper transaction fees and scalability than Bitcoin, the parent blockchain whose scalability remains limited.\n\nBitcoin Cash Rallying On Improving Sentiment\n\nThe uptick in Bitcoin Cash\u2014and cryptocurrency prices, in general, has been pinned to positive market sentiment and supportive fundamental development in the industry. Notably, the increasing institutional interest from players such as Blackrock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with over $9 trillion, has been cited as the primary driver of Bitcoin prices. BlackRock has submitted an application with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nBitcoin Cash is an altcoin that emerged due to a hard fork from Bitcoin in September 2017. The platform is scalable and can process transactions more cheaply. However, while it retains the same consensus algorithm as Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Cash network can pack more transactions in every block, considering its larger block size.\n\nThe increasing bullishness across the crypto sphere has positively impacted BCH. According to CoinMarketCap data, BCH has outperformed Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other liquid crypto assets. In the top 20, BCH is up 70% in the last trading week and 35% on the last trading day alone.\n\nAt this level, the Bitcoin Cash network is now more valuable than Cosmos, Monero, and Uniswap. Meanwhile, BCH is at a four-month high, and bulls have forced prices above key resistance levels and are trading at a 13-month high in May 2022 territory.\n\nSurging BCH Open Interest\n\nAt the back of this is a spike in open interest, suggesting an increase in both speculative and hedging activities surrounding BCH. Extending this development, traders and investors may be taking positions in anticipation of further price appreciation, considering the sharp expansion on June 23.\n\nAccording to Coinglass, BCH\u2019s open interest is over $229 million, an 85% spike in the last trading day. BCH-related trading volumes stand at over $2.8 billion during this time, a 4X surge.\n\nFeatures Image From Canva, Chart From TradingView"
