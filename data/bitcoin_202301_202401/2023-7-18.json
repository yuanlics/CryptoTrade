        "content": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted conspiracy theorist, vaccine skeptic, and Democratic candidate for president, is an undisputed fan of Bitcoin. And on Tuesday, Kennedy, who recently was condemned by his very own family for claiming that COVID-19 was engineered to target certain ethnic groups, unveiled two policy proposals to further endear himself to fans of the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nSpeaking virtually during an event hosted by Heal the Divide, a super PAC with ties to far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green and embattled Rep. George Santos, Kennedy said that he both wants to \u201cexempt the conversion of Bitcoin to the U.S. dollar from capital gains taxes\u201d as well as \u201cback the U.S. dollar with real finite assets, such as gold, silver, platinum, and Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe said the two policy proposals would be part of his \u201cadministration\u2019s mission of making America the global hub of cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe continued boosterism of Bitcoin from the presidential candidate, whose uncle was President John F. Kennedy, follows recent news that Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s family trust had between $100,000 and $250,000 in the cryptocurrency on its balance sheet. (The investment generated an income of less than $201.)\n\nHis family\u2019s Bitcoin investment pales in comparison to the millions of dollars he and other members of the political dynasty have in real estate, cash, and other assets; however, Kennedy said during the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, the first public appearance of his campaign, that he \u201cnot an investor\u201d and that he wasn\u2019t onstage \u201cto give investment advice.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Kennedy\u2019s campaign previously told Fortune that \u201cMr. Kennedy\u2019s investments in Bitcoin were made AFTER he made his speech and BEFORE the June 30th reporting deadline. There is no conflict.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidate is not the only high-profile politician to hold and boost Bitcoin. Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican candidate for president, owns up to $300,000 in Bitcoin and Ether, has invested in crypto firms MoonPay and Shipyard Software, and said he will accept donations to his campaign in Bitcoin. And Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida and another Republican presidential hopeful, also has put his weight behind the cryptocurrency."

        "title": "Crypto Needs Comprehensive Policies to Protect Economies and Investors - International Monetary Fund",
        "content": "The global push for clearer policies on crypto assets has gained momentum under the Indian G20 Presidency. As this work continues, it\u2019s important to recognize the progress already achieved, but more is needed, especially in implementing global standards.\n\nLast year\u2019s failures of the FTX crypto trading platform and the Terra Luna stablecoin highlighted the urgency of establishing clear policies to protect investors and prevent abuse. Despite recent industry challenges, investor optimism continues to revive periodically, as evidenced by Bitcoin\u2019s near doubling this year. Without robust safeguards, the increased risk of fraud and misconduct could adversely impact investors' expected returns.\n\nWhile some policymakers have taken necessary steps to safeguard consumers and ensure financial integrity, it is equally important to consider the broader implications of crypto. Such assets, particularly stablecoins denominated in hard currencies, could potentially replace official currencies, and significantly impact countries' monetary and fiscal policies. This is especially true in emerging markets and developing economies, underscoring the need for a comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated policy approach to crypto.\n\nThat\u2019s why we presented an assessment of the macro implications of crypto assets to the G20 presidency earlier this year, building on recommendations outlined in the Elements of Effective Policies for Crypto Assets endorsed by the IMF Executive Board in February.\n\nOur approach features three key pillars: a sound macro-policy foundation, clear legal treatment and granular rules, and effective implementation.\n\nThese are our key policy recommendations:\n\nThe defense against the substitution of sovereign currencies is the maintenance of robust, trusted, and credible domestic institutions. Transparent, consistent, and coherent monetary policy frameworks are crucial for an effective response to the challenges posed by crypto assets.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo protect national sovereignty, it is important not to grant crypto assets official currency or legal tender status. Doing so would require accepting them in many jurisdictions for tax payments, fines, and debt settlements, and could generate fiscal risks for government finances, and could threaten financial stability or rapid inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo address the volatility of capital flows associated with crypto, policymakers should integrate them within existing regimes and rules that manage capital flows. This will help ensure stability and minimize potential disruptions.\n\nFinally, tax policies should ensure unambiguous treatment of crypto assets, and administrators should strengthen compliance efforts. Specific regulations are needed to clarify the tax treatment of crypto, including value-added taxes or levies on income or wealth.\n\nClear legal treatment\n\nBuilding on a sound macro-policy foundation, clear legal treatment and granular rules are crucial. The principle of \"same activity, same risk, same regulations\" should guide regulatory efforts.\n\nConsistent with the recommendations by standard setters such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Financial Action Task Force, Financial Stability Board, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, our recommendations are:\n\nA comprehensive legal foundation is essential to effectively regulate crypto, addressing both private law and financial law aspects. This includes ensuring predictability and enforceability of rights while appropriately classifying crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), prudential and conduct rules should be implemented to cover all entities and activities related to the issuance, trading, custody, or transfer of crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor systemic stablecoin arrangements, additional requirements such as the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures\u2014standards that aim to ensure the safety, efficiency, and resilience of FMIs\u2014should be applied.\n\nSignificantly, the FSB in July established a set of high-level recommendations for crypto regulation, focusing on financial stability. They include ensuring authorities\u2019 regulatory powers and sound governance and risk management practices by providers. It also features revised high-level recommendations for effectively addressing financial stability risks associated with \"global stablecoin\" arrangements.\n\nOverall, the recommendations promote the consistency and comprehensiveness of regulatory, supervisory and oversight approaches to crypto.\n\nEffective implementation\n\nFinally, ensuring effective policies requires several measures including strong coordination, at the domestic and international level:\n\nNational authorities must align their frameworks to the emerging guidelines, and standards being developed by standard setting bodies. This alignment is critical to achieve consistent treatment of crypto assets and may require legislative changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping strong supervisory capacity is vital for monitoring and enforcing rules effectively. Authorities must have the necessary skills and resources to oversee the evolving crypto asset landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the borderless nature of the crypto-assets ecosystem, international collaboration and information sharing are crucial. Cooperation among supervisors and competent authorities will enable the monitoring of crypto asset service providers and maintain the efficacy of regulatory policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing beyond crypto polices,public authorities should take advantage in the progress in digital technology to enhance public policy objectives and must actively collaborate to address ongoing cost, trust, and speed issues, particularly for cross-border payments. New multilateral platforms could improve the efficiency of transactions.\n\nThe IMF will continue to support the G20 by delivering to the Leaders\u2019 Summit in September a joint IMF-FSB synthesis paper highlighting the building blocks for effective crypto policies. In addition, we are committed to providing tailored capacity building to our 190 members based on the above recommendations and emerging guidelines from standard setters. Our surveillance program will also assess the effectiveness of policy frameworks including crypto.\n\nBy embracing a comprehensive approach and implementing these recommendations, policymakers can safeguard monetary sovereignty, protect investor interests, and promote financial stability in the digital age."

        "content": "Greenpeace USA Exposes BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase CEO\u2019s Affair With Climate Wrecking Bitcoin through Massive NYC Projections\n\nGreenpeace USA unveiled the climate impacts of Bitcoin investments by financial giants JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Chase) and BlackRock through visual displays projected onto iconic structures in the heart of New York City.\n\nClick here for images and videos\n\nNew York, NY (July 18, 2023) \u2013 Using stunning projections on prominent buildings in the heart of NYC, Greenpeace USA cast a spotlight on the detrimental climate impact of Bitcoin investments by financial giants JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Chase) and BlackRock. The display painted the NYC skyline with images of BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Chase CEO Jamie Dimon donning red laser eyes, similar to the profiles of Bitcoin maximalists. Accompanying this visual spectacle, Greenpeace USA presented an array of facts and figures, shedding light on the undeniable climate impact associated with Bitcoin. This escalation follows the recent release of the report, Investing in Bitcoin\u2019s Climate Pollution: Big Finance is Betting on Dirty Bitcoin,\u201d and highlights the urgent need for change.\n\nThe Greenpeace USA report, published just days ago, exposes the financial institutions driving Bitcoin\u2019s climate destruction. It reveals that BlackRock, Chase, and other major players such as Fidelity, Vanguard, CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, Visa, Mastercard, and American Express have collectively invested a staggering $1.5 billion in Bitcoin mining. By facilitating broader use of Bitcoin and offering Bitcoin-backed investment products, these companies are also accelerating the growth of Bitcoin emissions, which already rival those of countries like Sweden. This directly contradicts these financial institutions\u2019 climate commitments.\n\nBitcoin, referred to as a \u201cclimate bomb,\u201d consumes energy at an alarming scale. The majority of this energy is derived from fossil fuels like coal and gas. Shockingly, coal-fired power plants that were slated for closure have been kept open or even reopened to power Bitcoin mining operations.The projections serve as a visual reminder of the critical issue at hand and demand immediate action from Chase and BlackRock.\n\nJoshua Archer, Greenpeace USA Bitcoin Campaign Lead said: \u201cEvery scientific report makes clear that we need to rapidly transition away from fossil fuels if we\u2019re going to keep our planet habitable. But influential financial leaders BlackRock and Chase are setting us back years in our urgent need to transition to renewable energy. The images we cast onto the New York City skyline are intended to hold these companies accountable for the impact their Bitcoin bets are having on climate and communities. We hope the financial services industry will engage with us to clean up Bitcoin and build a just and green future for all.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace USA invites the public to join the movement and support the organization\u2019s efforts to urge Bitcoin to adopt significantly less-energy intensive practices. The projections serve as a rallying cry, urging BlackRock, JP Morgan Chase, and other financial institutions to take immediate action.\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Greenpeace USA Senior Communications Specialist, [email protected], 631-404-9977\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future. Greenpeace USA is committed to transforming the country\u2019s unjust social, environmental, and economic systems from the ground up to address the climate crisis, advance racial justice, and build an economy that puts people first.

        "content": "Hype around spot bitcoin ETFs has spiked in the last month, but patience from prospective issuers and industry watchers will be key as the SEC reviews the latest wave of filings.\n\nThe SEC officially added Bitwise\u2019s proposed spot bitcoin ETF to its federal register on Tuesday \u2014 triggering the start of a 240-day clock for the SEC to make a ruling on the proposal \u2014 though there are other deadlines to keep an eye on.\n\nSimilar funds by BlackRock, Fidelity and others are expected to be added to the register in short order, initiating the countdown for rulings on those as well.\n\nThough many are paying attention to the SEC\u2019s ruling schedule for BlackRock\u2019s planned spot bitcoin ETF \u2014 the perceived favorite by some to launch first \u2014 an unrelated deadline in mid-August could send a signal to the asset manager and other issuers.\n\nDeadline coming for proposal by Ark Invest, 21Shares\n\nThe SEC has until Aug. 13 to essentially approve, deny or delay a bitcoin ETF by 21Shares and Ark Invest.\n\nThe deadline represents the second stage of a 240-day process broken into four periods \u2014 45 days, 45 days, 90 days and 60 days. At the end of the first three periods, the SEC must either allow the planned product to launch, block it from doing so, or ask for more time.\n\nThe SEC cannot ask for more time at the end of 240 days \u2014 a period set to expire on Jan. 10.\n\nSwitzerland-based 21Shares and New York-headquartered Ark Invest together refiled for a spot bitcoin ETF in April after the SEC rejected its previous attempt in March 2022. The latest proposal was published to the federal register on May 15, setting up a June 29 initial deadline \u2014 45 days later \u2014 for the SEC.\n\nAs expected by many industry watchers, the SEC requested more time. The ruling came two weeks before the deadline.\n\n\u201cThe Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,\u201d the June 15 filing states.\n\nAug. 13 marks 45 days from the June 29 deadline. By that date, the SEC will either issue a ruling on the planned product or request an extension for further consideration.\n\nThe initial rulings are often telling of how the SEC will treat the proposal later on, industry watchers said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exceedingly rare for the SEC to approve an ETF filing after so much obvious angst, with multiple extensions and filing/re-filings and so on,\u201d according to Lara Crigger, editor-in-chief at data firm VettaFi.\n\nThe process has changed from years ago when the SEC would let ETF proposals \u201clive in SEC limbo\u201d for years instead of being denied, Crigger added. Such was the case with cannabis ETFs until 2017, when the ETF Managers Group was finally able to change its Latin America Real Estate ETF (LARE) to the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ).\n\n\u201cThey are now forced to make a decision one way or another,\u201d Crigger told Blockworks. \u201cHence, the extensions, withdrawals, re-filings, and so on.\u201d\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said he is paying attention to the SEC\u2019s decisions early in the 240-day window.\n\n\u201cThe odds of the SEC \u2014 after going through that process of the 45-day period, 45 days, 90 days and 60 days \u2014 then all of a sudden the SEC accepting and approving seems a little skeptical to me if this surveillance-sharing agreement is the silver bullet we\u2019ve been looking for,\u201d Seyffart said earlier this month on the ETF Prime Podcast.\n\nSSA at the heart of latest bitcoin ETF filings\n\nA surveillance-sharing agreement, or SSA, is at the center of the active spot bitcoin ETF filings.\n\nRead more: How \u2018surveillance-sharing\u2019 is designed to deter bitcoin ETF manipulation\n\nIn a filing on June 15, Nasdaq, the potential listing exchange for BlackRock\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF, disclosed its readiness to establish a surveillance-sharing agreement with \u201can operator of a US-based spot trading platform for bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe company later amended filings to name Coinbase as the platform.\n\nCboe amended filings last week on behalf of Ark Invest and 21Shares \u2014 as well as several other fund groups \u2014 stating in the latest documents that it \u201creached an agreement on terms,\u201d with Coinbase to enter into SSAs.\n\n\u201cThey can delay again and say we need to see the actual SSA,\u201d Seyffart added on the podcast. \u201cAnd then we can get to another deadline and see what happens there.\u201d\n\nOther deadlines become clearer\n\nThe US securities regulator last week formally acknowledged the bitcoin ETF applications by Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, WisdomTree and VanEck.\n\nThe step precedes the SEC publishing the proposals to the federal register \u2014 an action that initiates the 240-day clock for it to rule on the proposals.\n\nBitwise\u2019s proposed ETF appeared on the federal register Tuesday.\n\nUnless the SEC publishes the other proposals to the register today, there won\u2019t be a \u201ccommon clock\u201d for the latest wave of filings, Seyffart said in a Tuesday tweet \u2014 meaning applications could be ruled on in the order they were filed.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts believed such a \u201ccommon clock\u201d might indicate positive news for ultimate approval on the same day, he added.\n\n\u201cThis obviously doesn\u2019t mean definitive approval or denial either way,\u201d Seyffart said in a separate tweet. \u201cWe were just just looking for any indication as to which way they may be leaning. But the SEC isn\u2019t showing their hand.\u201d\n\nIf the SEC takes the full 240 days to rule on the proposed Bitwise fund \u2014 and others expected to hit the federal register soon \u2014 such decisions would come in mid-March.\n\nCrigger said she believes approvals will be tough to achieve, noting not much has substantially changed regarding the surveillance requirements from the SEC and the regulatory landscape.\n\n\u201cIt really does seem like would-be bitcoin ETF issuers and the SEC are at an impasse,\u201d \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll refile with some tweaks. Maybe they\u2019ll give up.\u201d"

        "title": "In \"Easy Money,\" crypto's central premise is put to the test - Marketplace",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency has had a rough time in the past year or so. The value of bitcoin has fallen to less than half its peak of $65,000 back in the fall of 2021, and former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is facing criminal charges over his role in the meltdown of the prominent crypto exchange. Yet as the crypto industry tries to move past what some are calling a crypto winter, skeptics are questioning its very premise: Is it even possible to realize the promise of a \u201cdecentralized\u201d currency? Is crypto, as an idea, flawed?\n\n\u201cThese cryptocurrencies are not currencies, economically speaking, because they don\u2019t do what money does,\u201d actor and writer Ben McKenzie said in an interview with \u201cMarketplace\u201d host Kai Ryssdal. \u201cMoney, ultimately is trust. Cryptocurrency famously says, \u2018Oh, we can replace that. Crypto can be a trustless form of money where all you have to do is trust the code.\u2019 But code does not fall from the sky.\u201d\n\nMcKenzie, along with his collaborator, Jacob Silverman, investigated the crypto industry writ large in their new book, \u201cEasy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud.\u201d What they found was a sector prone to both speculation and fraud.\n\nIn the following excerpt, McKenzie (who possesses a 20-something-year-old economics degree) takes a closer look at the \u201ccurrency\u201d bit of \u201ccryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nThe first problem I had with cryptocurrency was the word. They were using the wrong one.\n\nIn economics, currencies do things: They are a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Medium of exchange means you use it to buy and sell stuff. Most people, if pressed, will define money this way: You buy shit with it. If we didn\u2019t have money, we\u2019d have to rely on bartering for the things we need. As an actor/performer, I\u2019d literally be singing for my supper, which, if you have ever heard me sing, would be a terrible idea. Money simplifies things, creating a quantifiable system of IOUs we Americans call dollars. Unit of account is a way of measuring the market value of goods, services, and other transactions against each other. A stable currency allows an economy to function efficiently; businesses can run their books and monitor their performance over time. The last function of money\u2014store of value\u2014is exactly that: something that holds its value over time. A strong currency has a relatively steady value over time. What good is a dollar if one day my deli bagel costs $1.50, the next $10, and the next $5? I\u2019d rather skip breakfast. The more a currency fluctuates in value, the less useful it is to the public, to businesses, and to the government that issues it.\n\nCryptocurrencies didn\u2019t do any of these things well. You couldn\u2019t buy stuff with them\u2014the guys at my deli would look at me like I was nuts if I tried to pay for my bagel and coffee in Bitcoin. Advocates say this is a temporary problem; if more people would just buy Bitcoin, eventually it will become a currency you can actually use. That\u2019s wrong for many reasons, but I\u2019ll focus on the simplest one for now: The technology behind Bitcoin sucks. It doesn\u2019t scale. Satoshi\u2019s solution to the double spend problem was innovative, but also clunky. The more miners who entered the competition the more energy was used, but the blocks were the same. Bitcoin is able to handle only five to seven transactions a second; it can never go above that. Visa can process 24,000. To operate, Bitcoin uses an enormous amount of energy, the equivalent in 2021 of Argentina\u2014the entire country. Visa and Mastercard use comparatively minuscule amounts of electricity to serve a customer base orders of magnitude greater. Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption is enormously wasteful, and poses a massive environmental problem for the supposedly cutting-edge technology (and really, for all of us).\n\nWhen it came to the other two functions of money\u2014store of value and unit of account\u2014Bitcoin also fails miserably. The price jumps up and down like a rabbit on amphetamines, making it impossible to run a business using Bitcoin (or any other crypto) or hold on to it for any period of time with reasonable confidence it would retain its value. Could you use a cryptocurrency as a rudimentary form of money? I mean, sure. You could call a brick a soccer ball, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend using it that way.\n\nSo if cryptocurrencies weren\u2019t currencies, then what were they? How do they actually work in the real world? Well, you put real money into them and hope to make real money off of them through no work of your own. Under American law, that\u2019s an investment contract. More precisely, it\u2019s a security.\n\nThanks to a 1946 Supreme Court decision, securities are often defined by what\u2019s called the Howey Test. The test has four prongs: (1) an investment of money, (2) in a common enterprise, (3) with the expectation of profit, (4) to be derived from the efforts of others. Check, check, check, and check. Although Bitcoin had somehow come to be classified as a commodity, it was blindingly clear to me that the 20,000 or so other cryptos ought to be classified as securities under American law, and yet they had not been, or at least not clearly enough to stop them from spreading like wildfire.\n\nPrior to the 1930s we did not have federal securities laws in the United States. Securities were regulated at the state level under what were called blue-sky laws. They did not work very well. Fraud was commonplace; the stock markets in particular reflected a capitalistic free-for-all with little to no outside oversight. (Recall [John Maynard] Keynes and the origin of the term casino capitalism.) While everything was going up in price, no one seemed to mind. During the roaring twenties, millions of Americans were lured into booming markets with faulty foundations. It was a bubble, and like all bubbles it eventually burst. The stock market crash of 1929 destroyed the finances of multitudes and ultimately led to the Great Depression. In response to this devastation, and the manipulation and fraud in the markets that contributed to it, Congress passed federal securities laws in 1933 and 1934. In terms of protecting investors, the primary purpose of those laws was to require disclosure on behalf of the issuer; if you were investing money in a particular security, you needed to know what you were investing in (i.e., who you were giving your money to) and what they were doing with that money. Cryptocurrencies have no disclosure requirements, effectively by design; the pseudonymity of the blockchain conceals who owns what. Much like the 1920s, this left the door wide open for deception and scams.\n\nStaring in disbelief at the crypto markets in the spring of 2021, I came to a terrifying conclusion: Slightly less than a century after the crash of 1929, we had come full circle. There were now potentially 20,000 unregistered, unlicensed securities\u2014more than all the publicly listed securities in the major US stock markets\u2014for sale to the general public. Worse, these unregistered, unlicensed securities were primarily traded on crypto exchanges, which often served multiple market functions and, therefore, had massive conflicts of interest. And perhaps most disturbing, most of the volume in crypto ran through overseas exchanges. Rather than being registered in the United States, they were often run through shell corporations in the Caribbean, apparently to avoid falling under any particular regulatory jurisdiction. Private entities were essentially printing their own money and circulating it through offshore markets. In terms of propensity for fraud, what could be more appealing? Stepping back even further, what did these cryptocurrencies do? From where did their value derive? They were bizarre. Imagine a conventional security, such as a share of stock in the company Apple. Where does that stock get its value? Well, Apple makes stuff. (The iPhone is one year older than the Bitcoin white paper.) Apple sells that stuff\u2014phones, computers, watches\u2014as well as services, such as streaming music and video subscriptions. These sales produce a revenue stream\u2014earnings over time that can be projected forward. When you buy a share of Apple, you are effectively buying a portion of the revenue stream, as well as the brand equity, market share, intellectual property\u2014all of that. But cryptos don\u2019t make stuff or do stuff. There are no goods or services produced. It\u2019s air, pure securitized air.\n\nExcerpted from the new book \u201cEasy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud\u201d by Ben McKenzie with Jacob Silverman, published by Abrams Press.

The documentary \"Bitcoin in Latin America\" takes an exciting road trip through Guatemala and El Salvador.\n\nImage: BR\n\nThe Bitcoin utopia promises more financial participation, the expansion of infrastructure through green mining, and new investors attracted by mega-projects like the planned \"Bitcoin City\" in El Salvador. But what lies behind these promises?\n\nImage: BR\n\nIn Guatemala, a U.S. citizen and former military doctor in picturesque Panajachel is trying to mine gold from trash through Bitcoins. But doesn't that sound too good to be true?\n\nImage: BR\n\nIn El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele even introduced the Bitcoin as a second state currency - one year later, however, there was less and less evidence of Bitcoin living up to the hype.

        "title": "12 Countries That Don't Tax Bitcoin Capital Gains - Nomad Capitalist",
        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the future of Bitcoin and which countries won\u2019t tax you on your Bitcoin capital gains.\n\nIf you\u2019re not already familiar with cryptocurrency, don\u2019t worry. You can get a quick Crypto 101 crash course before you proceed.\n\nCryptocurrency has come a long way since it emerged back in 2008. Instead of just being thought of as an alternative currency, it has now become a sought-after investment. In fact, some argue that crypto is the future.\n\nWhile physical, printed cash is still the medium that most countries use, many are adopting digital forms of currency.\n\nBut not so fast, in some countries, that adoption comes laden with regulations.\n\nYet, you may be able to escape those regulations by adding digital assets to your wealth portfolio.\n\nWhether you want to diversify your assets by investing in cryptocurrency, discover crypto-friendly countries, or expand your passport portfolio, Nomad Capitalist can help you.\n\nWe\u2019ve helped many crypto-investors go where they\u2019re treated best, and we can help you do the same. Get in touch with us today to discuss your Action Plan.\n\nCountries That Don\u2019t Tax Bitcoin Gains\n\nConsider moving your digital assets offshore to avoid paying tax on bitcoin capital gains.\n\nWhile many countries may follow suit with the US and start taxing capital gains on Bitcoin, there are still several countries that don\u2019t.\n\nHere are 12 for your consideration:\n\nBelarus\n\nIn 2018, Belarus created a ground-breaking law that legalized cryptocurrency. The law stated that until at least 2023, individuals and businesses that mine for or invest in cryptocurrencies are exempt from paying taxes on them. This year, the law may be subject to review. However, currently, in Bulgaria, crypto is considered a personal investment, so you can mine, buy, or sell cryptocurrencies here freely.\n\nBermuda\n\nBermuda does not impose taxes on digital assets or their transactions. That includes no income tax, capital gains, withholding, or other taxes. And as of 2019, any taxes that you do incur there can be paid with USD Coin, another digital coin.\n\nWant to incorporate Bermuda in your offshore Plan? Read our ultimate guides about opening an offshore bank account and establishing residency in Bermuda.\n\nBritish Virgin Islands\n\nThis tax haven is neutral when it comes to capital gains, corporate income, or withholding taxes. And for the time being, that includes cryptocurrency as well. This means that there are no specific taxes imposed against cryptocurrencies in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nTo bank or run a business in BVI, read our ultimate guide about BVI incorporation and BVI banking.\n\nCayman Islands\n\nLike the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands are already a tax haven. This means that the processes of issuing, holding, or transferring digital assets will not be subject to taxes here either.\n\nRelocating to the Cayman Islands can drastically reduce your taxes. However, the Cayman Islands has put a high price on its residency, and it\u2019s almost impossible to bank there as a non-resident.\n\nGermany\n\nGermany can be excellent for long-term crypto holders. In Germany, cryptocurrencies are considered to be private money. As such, they are exempt from taxes. However, you must hold said cryptocurrencies for over a year to be entitled to this perk. And if you sell any assets that have not been held for at least a year, the tax won\u2019t accrue if the sale is less than 600 euros. Unfortunately, businesses in Germany are not as lucky and must pay corporate income taxes on any cryptocurrency gains.\n\nGibraltar\n\nAlready famous for low taxation, Gibraltar does not subject cryptocurrency investments to capital gains taxes. However, there is a fixed 10% corporate tax rate that is applied to crypto-trading.\n\nHong Kong\n\nIn Hong Kong, as long as individual cryptocurrency activities are for investment purposes, there is no capital gains tax. But for corporations, when digital assets are traded as a normal part of business, they are then subject to an income tax.\n\nMalaysia\n\nYou will want to be careful in Malaysia. Currently, if you make cryptocurrency transactions as an individual investor infrequently, then you will not be subject to taxes. However, if you are an \u201cactive trader,\u201d your virtual assets can incur a capital gains tax.\n\nMalta has an excellent long-term residency program \u2013 MM2H \u2013 for people looking to relocate to Malaysia.\n\nMalta\n\nMalta is known as \u201cBlockchain Island\u201d and is one of the most crypto-friendly countries. Here, you will not have to worry about capital gains tax for any long-held cryptocurrencies. However, if you make same-day trades, you will be subject to income tax as you would with day-trading stocks. The country may also subject crypto trades to an income tax.\n\nMoreover, Malta has one of the best citizenship-by-investment programs in the EU.\n\nSingapore\n\nCapital gains tax doesn\u2019t exist in Singapore. Therefore, individuals and businesses that hold cryptocurrencies are not subject to such a tax. However, businesses are liable to pay income tax on any gains.\n\nSlovenia\n\nAs with many of these countries, Slovenia applies a different tax law to individuals and to businesses. Here, an individual will not incur a capital gains tax on any cryptocurrency that they sell. However, they will be subject to income tax on their profits, and corporations will be liable to pay income tax at the corporate rate.\n\nNote, however, that the crypto-tax policies may change in Slovenia due to a piece of legislation that\u2019s currently pending.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nConsidered a crypto-haven, Switzerland also has a few tax breaks for cryptocurrency traders. Individuals that buy, sell, or hold cryptocurrencies will not have to pay a capital gains tax. However, this country considers cryptocurrency mining as self-employment, so an income tax will be applied to any resulting income from this activity. For professional cryptocurrency traders, a business income tax will be applied. It is also important to note that Switzerland has other wealth and cantonal taxes that may apply.\n\nAdditionally, there are other countries that are extremely crypto-friendly that you might want to keep your eye on. Though, they may not have the tax incentives that you\u2019re hoping for.\n\nFor Roger Ver, Antigua is at the top of his list. He claims that there is a large amount of cryptocurrency adoption by both the government and the rest of the island. Proof of this can be seen in nearly every restaurant now allowing payments with Bitcoin cash.\n\nThe Bottomline\n\nIf you\u2019re a seven- or eight-figure entrepreneur who wants to move your assets to a country where you won\u2019t lose half of your wealth in taxes, contact the Nomad Capitalist team. We\u2019re ready to help you create an offshore strategy for your digital assets."

        "content": "Bitcoin briefly fell under US$30,000 in early Tuesday morning trading in Asia before recovering back above that support line. Ether and most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies declined, with Solana leading the losers. Polygon\u2019s Matic was the exception, adding more than one percent at one point. NFT trading slumped and U.S. stock futures traded flat after gains on Monday. The week ahead brings rafts of earnings, including from major U.S. banks on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin, Ether slip\n\nBitcoin lost 0.55% over the last 24 hours to US$30,160.39 as of 06:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, falling 0.62% for the week, according to data from CryptoMarketCap. The token dipped to US$29,685.78 at one point in early morning Asia trading on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOn a weekly timeframe, Bitcoin is trending up on the highs and lows, but down on the close and open,\u201d said Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based online brokerage FxPro. \u201cFailure to rally from current levels opens the door for a correction to the $27,000 area if risk-off sentiment intensifies later in the week.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency with a current market capitalization of US$586 billion has attracted bouts of buying interest following several filings for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in June, including one by the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock.\n\nOn July 13, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formally accepted the Bitcoin ETF applications from BlackRock, WisdomTree, VanEck and others for review.\n\nWhen measured by investments in crypto-focused funds, Bitcoin has seen inflows of US$140 million in the last week, or 99% of the total invested in such funds, according to asset manager CoinShares. A total US$742 million was invested in crypto funds over the last 4 weeks, the largest since the final quarter of 2021, according to CoinShares data.\n\nEther declined by 1.07% to US$1,913.56, but was still holding gains of 2.03% in the last seven days. Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were in the red, though Polygon\u2019s Matic added to weekly gains of 5.99%. Matic rose 0.37% to US$0.781 in early trade and gained further later in the morning.\n\nLast Thursday, Polygon Labs announced a new, revamped version of its native token named Pol, which the company claims will be more secure, scalable and frictionless.\n\nSolana was the biggest loser among the top 10 falling 3.26% to US$26.74. However that could be from profit-taking as the token has jumped 25.55% for the week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 0.49% in the past 24 hours to US$1.21 trillion, while trading volume rose 42.52% to US$35.54 billion.\n\nNFTs in \u201csubstantial slowdown\u201d\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.27% in the past 24 hours to 2,719.10 as of 07:45 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 0.43% for the week.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT Index is down following a very slow day of trading,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cFocusing on Ethereum trading we see 14,006 total transactions on Sunday, which is the lowest in almost 2 years, when we saw 13,560 transactions on July 24, 2021.\u201d\n\nPetscher said the number of unique buyers fell under 10,000, also a substantial slowdown in the NFT market.\n\nForkast\u2019s NFT market indices measuring the performance on Ethereum, Solana and Cardano blockchains rose, while the Polygon index dropped.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume gained 1.45% to US$18.51 million in the past 24 hours, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nEthereum-based art NFT collection Opepen Edition topped the trading volume rankings on CryptoSlam, rising 2.93% in the last 24 hours to US$782,290.\n\n\u201cOpepen is an interesting hybrid project that merges conceptual art into easy to digest profile pictures,\u201d Petscher explained. \u201cInfluencers and even large Web3 entities like OpenSea and Rarible are getting in on the fun by changing their profile pictures to an Opepen that matches their brand.\u201d\n\nImmutableX\u2019s Gods Unchained Cards, the collection of NFTs used in Immutable\u2019s trading card game of the same name, placed second in 24-hour trading volume, despite falling 2.19% to US$675,685.\n\nElsewhere, NFL Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said on Twitter Monday that he will launch his second line of NFTs inspired by his football career. The new collectibles are expected in September, according to Decrypt.\n\nU.S. stock futures little changed, Asia markets lower\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong after all three major U.S. indexes gained during regular trading on Monday.\n\nStocks in main Asia markets fell back after China on Monday reported lower-than-expected economic growth of 6.3% for Q2. The Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 all posted losses as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the U.S., more bank earnings are coming later today from Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley & Co., which follow positive quarterly results last week from JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup. Earnings from Goldman Sachs Group, Netflix, Tesla and United Airlines are expected Wednesday.\n\nThe view that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its cycle of raising interest rates helped the Wall Street gains on Monday, according to Trading Economics. That sentiment grew as last week\u2019s producer price index, a measure of wholesale inflation, came in well below analyst expectations.\n\nStill, the Fed is likely to raise rates again above the current 5% to 5.25%. Christopher Waller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said last week at an event hosted by New York University that the central bank will need two more 25-basis-point rate increases this year to tame inflation.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets on July 26 to discuss its next move on rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 97.3% chance the Fed will raise by 25-basis-points, up from 96.1% on Monday.\n\n(Updates to add equity section)"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nRobert Kennedy wants to back the US Dollar with \u2018hard currencies\u2019\n\nHow Kennedy plans to fight off inflation with gold and Bitcoin\n\nWhy was the US Dollar removed from the gold standard?\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democratic presidential candidate is doing the rounds for his campaign. Among his main talking points is his strong support for Bitcoin as a legible form of payment within the US.\n\nBesides being a Bitcoin holder, Kennedy Jr. sees the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential as a way to stabilize the value of the US dollar and counteract the rampant inflation occurring in the nation.\n\nDuring the Heal-the-Divide PAC event on July 19th, Kennedy Jr. discussed the potential for Bitcoin, alongside gold and silver, as backing for the US dollar, claiming it\u2019s a \u2018hard currency\u2019.\n\nBitcoin Is The Future Of Finance, Says Kennedy Jr.\n\n\u201cThe Kennedy administration will begin to back the US dollar with real finite assets, such as gold, silver, platinum, and Bitcoin, which is the world\u2019s hardest liquid asset, to strengthen the US dollar and guarantee its success as a world reserve currency,\u201d said Kennedy Jr. during his Heal-the-Divide PAC virtual event.\n\nThe Democrat presidential candidate is an avid supporter of cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, as a viable payment and investment option in the US. RFK has reportedly invested over $250,000 in Bitcoin, which is a sign that he personally supports the crypto token movement, not just a presidential campaign gimmick.\n\nHowever, RFK\u2019s speech floated more than just the idea of stabilizing the value of the US dollar using Bitcoin and precious metals.\n\n\u201cBacking dollars and U.S. debt obligations with hard assets could help restore strength back to the dollar, rein in inflation, and usher in a new era of American financial stability, peace and prosperity.\u201d\n\nKennedy Jr. also talked about the idea of removing taxes when converting Bitcoin to fiat USD. The idea is to remove the financial barrier for individual investors to invest in Bitcoin and altcoins by creating a seamless financial environment without overcharging fees. On top of that, RFK is a strong supporter of creating individual crypto wallets and home-based crypto nodes that would provide Americans with freedom over their finances, eliminating the threat of governments \u201ccontrolling freedom of speech using the threat of inflation\u201d.\n\nAs president, I will make sure that your right to use and hold Bitcoin is inviolable. Bitcoin is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and the manipulation of our money supply, it points the way toward a future in which government institutions are more transparent and more\u2026 pic.twitter.com/rPkMARieYu \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) June 27, 2023\n\nIs Relying On \u2018Hard Currencies\u2019 A Good Idea?\n\nThe US Dollar was removed from the gold standard back in 1971 by President Nixon as part of an economic movement now known as the Nixon Shock. Ever since, the US never fully returned to a fixed exchange rate system or a strict gold standard. The US dollar has since been a fiat currency, meaning that its value is based on trade activities and international demand.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that there have been some subsequent efforts to reintroduce aspects of the gold standard or alternative systems with ties to gold, including the Smithsonian Agreement in 1971, and the Jamaica Agreement in 1976.\n\nHowever, all attempts made by various politicians, economists, and advocates have failed to return the fiat currency to a fixed gold standard.\n\nIt\u2019s rather unorthodox to include Bitcoin in a list of \u2018hard currencies\u2019 that include gold and platinum as financial instruments to support the US dollar\u2019s value. The main reason behind that is that the inflation-adjusted return of gold annually has been about 3.3%, and the total return has been about 57%. At the same time, Bitcoin has an inflation-adjusted annualized return of nearly 145% and a total return of 33,983,965%.\n\nGold and other precious metals may seem like an outdated form of currency valuation, but it holds the advantage of longevity. The value of precious metals does fluctuate, but often by minute percentages, simply because it has been tried and tested for countless years.\n\nBitcoin and altcoins, on the other hand, are relatively infant value deposits. Hence, these tokens tend to fluctuate in value in far larger margins.\n\nGranted Bitcoin\u2019s future does look to be more secure since the involvement of major financial institutions, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, who promise to \u201cdemocratize crypto\u201d, perhaps leading to a potentially more stable financial future."

Later, in Q4 2022, the corporation cut its holdings of digital assets from $218 million to $184 million, and it has remained at that level ever since.\n\nMusk is known for his fondness for Dogecoin but has also said he's not advising anyone to buy crypto or bet the farm on Dogecoin."

        "title": "Bitcoin mining is becoming more environmentally friendly - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) mining\u2019s environmental impact has always been a controversial topic. On the one hand, critics emphasize that securing the Bitcoin network takes more power than some whole countries\u2019 annual electricity consumption. On the other hand, much of the crypto community argues that it is a necessary activity that has enabled the Bitcoin blockchain to remain extremely resilient against external attacks with an almost 99.99% uptime throughout over 14 years of its history.\n\nHowever, recent developments in the market have provided an opportunity for participants to make Bitcoin mining finally sustainable.\n\nBitcoin mining doesn\u2019t deserve its bad reputation\n\nBefore going over the benefits themselves, it\u2019s essential to first get some facts straight about Bitcoin mining. With comparisons to nations\u2019 energy consumption and estimates that a single BTC transaction has a carbon footprint of nearly 820,000 Visa transactions, it should be highlighted that this activity doesn\u2019t actually produce any emissions.\n\nBitcoin energy consumption, February 2017-July 2023. Source: BitcoinEnergyConsumption.com\n\nInstead, this \u201cdirty work\u201d is done by the power plants that supply the electricity to the mining rigs. Similarly to households or other business entities, miners only use the electrical infrastructure that exists in any given location.\n\nEver since Tesla stopped accepting Bitcoin payments in May 2021, citing environmental concerns, many have jumped on the bandwagon to criticize the blockchain network\u2019s energy consumption. However, while it is important to address Bitcoin mining\u2019s high electricity usage, it should not be done in a vacuum, as it is not the only power-hungry industry out there.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: Even worse for crypto than central exchanges\n\nAccording to the Bitcoin Mining Council, BTC mining consumes only a fraction of the energy required to power industries, such as construction (3.77%), finance and insurance (4.45%), shipping (5.41%) and aviation (5.43%). It even takes nearly 2.6 times the electricity to mine gold than to secure the Bitcoin network. And that\u2019s without even discussing the disposal of electronic devices, as well as the agriculture and livestock industries, which are among those with the most significant environmental footprints.\n\nConsidering the above, it seems unfair to point out Bitcoin mining\u2019s high electricity usage without mentioning how much power other industries consume each day.\n\nMining is becoming an increasingly sustainable industry\n\nDespite controversies around the topic, the fact remains that it takes a significant amount of electricity to secure and maintain the Bitcoin network. The question is how to make Bitcoin more sustainable.\n\nOne solution would be to combine Bitcoin mining with other business activities in a beneficial manner. For example, hydro-cooling mining farms can supply heat to greenhouses, fish farms, buildings and even entire communities. While only eight WhatsMiners are needed to warm a 10,000-square-foot greenhouse, increasing water temperature by 10 degrees Celsius via mining rigs can shorten the period of growth of salmon in fish farms by up to three times. Another potential use case includes developing small hydropower plants to co-consume electricity with local communities.\n\nRelated: Don\u2019t be naive \u2014 BlackRock\u2019s ETF won\u2019t be bullish for Bitcoin\n\nUsing associated petroleum gas (APG) to power Bitcoin mining rigs is also a key highlight in this field. As you may already know, APG is a byproduct of oil drilling. As it is not always worthwhile for producers to use it, they regularly burn it on-site. The latter process is called gas flaring, which led to 2.7 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions in 2021, along with the gas wasted in venting and methane leaks.\n\nInstead of wasting this resource, Bitcoin miners can transform APG into energy to power their rigs. By preventing flarings, this activity can have a favorable effect on the environment. In fact, a report revealed that Bitcoin mining can decrease the percentage of flared gas by each oil producer by 80%.\n\nAt the same time, researchers have also found that it is by far the most cost-efficient way to decrease emissions, surpassing the values of wind and solar by multiple times. This is probably why many smaller oil and gas companies in the United States are mining BTC with flared gas.\n\nThe road to a greener Bitcoin\n\nAs Bitcoin miners have been migrating to countries where they have access to cheaper energy in the form of renewables, this has presented an opportunity for market participants to increase the industry\u2019s sustainability.\n\nWith initiatives like preventing gas flaring and combining it with other business activities, the long-term goal is to make Bitcoin mining eco-friendly. Ideally, every industry should become as sustainable as possible while minimizing the harm caused to the environment. Putting in effort to make this possible is what being responsible market participants is about.\n\nBitcoin mining is already doing a lot to transform the energy sector due to miners being very flexible in their electricity consumption. And as this industry\u2019s sustainability improves in the years ahead, it will attract many large-scale investors who are interested in investing in eco-friendly businesses.\n\nDidar Bekbauov is the CEO of Bitcoin mining company Xive, which he co-founded in 2019. He previously served as a managing partner at Hive Mining. He holds an undergraduate degree from Kazakh-British Technical University and a master\u2019s degree in financial management from Robert Gordon University.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Fidelity Digital Assets released a \u201cQ2 2023 Signals Report\u201d on July 18, which claimed that Ether\u2019s outlook for the next 12 months and the long term is positive. Year-to-date, Ether (ETH) has gained 62%, but while the investment firm might be short-term bullish on Ether, that does not mean it believes that the month-long bullish channel will be sustained.\n\nWhile institutional investors like Fidelity Digital Assets may have a bullish longer-term vision for ETH's price, let\u2019s compare their analysis against network and market data to see if they\u2019re on the money.\n\nEther/USD 1-day price index. Source: TradingView\n\nBeyond the technical indicators, the rationale behind Fidelity\u2019s bullish outlook for Ether is the network\u2019s higher burn rate versus coin issuance, the \u201cnew address momentum\u201d and a growth in the number of network validators.\n\nFidelity \u201cQ2 2023 Signals Report,\u201d July 18. Source: Fidelity Digital Assets\n\nAccording to the Fidelity report, the net issuance since the Merge in September 2022 resulted in a net supply decrease of more than 700,000 Ether. Additionally, the analysts claim that Glassnode data showing an increasing number of Ethereum addresses that transacted for the first time ever proves healthy network adoption.\n\nThe report also points to a 15% increase in the number of active Ethereum validators in the second quarter.\n\nThe expectation around EIP-1153 is also building momentum for the Ethereum network, as the \u201ctransient storage opcode\u201d improves smart contract efficiency, reduces costs and amplifies the Ethereum Virtual Machine design. The change is especially meaningful for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where Ethereum\u2019s dominance declined to 46% from 60% six months prior, according to DefiLlama data.\n\nDencun upgrade expected to reduce transaction costs\n\nAnother potentially bullish factor for the Ethereum network is the anticipated upgrade on the leading DEX, Uniswap. According to a July 17 presentation at the Ethereum Community Conference, the upcoming Uniswap v4 will allow users to build unlimited types of pools using programmable buttons (hooks), native ETH support and a singleton contract that performs internal transactions before settling final balances.\n\nThe announcement fueled the likelihood that EIP-1153 will be included in the next \u201cDencun\u201d upgrade, which triggered Slingshot and DeFi Pulse co-founder Scott Lewis.\n\ni had missed the news that uniswap labs got eip1153 into cancun.\n\n\n\nthey kept the details for wanting eip1153 secret from the community, only publishing v4 only after inclusion was finalized.\n\n\n\ninformal governance captured by an insider-aligned, for-profit monopoly. sad day. \u2014 scottlewis.canto\u2795 (@scott_lew_is) June 13, 2023\n\nIf approved, the implementation will be vital for the Ethereum network to recoup the market share lost due to high gas fees, as the seven-day average transaction cost has been above $4 since February. Consequently, Ethereum\u2019s total value locked has dropped to its lowest level since April 2020, at 13.55 million ETH, according to DefiLlama.\n\nMoreover, decentralized application activity has dwindled, as shown by DappRadar\u2019s unique active wallets\u2019 30-day data: Uniswap, minus 28%; 1inch Network, minus 14%; MetaMask Swap, minus 8%; and OpenSea, minus 5%. As a comparison, in the same period, BNB Smart Chain\u2019s PancakeSwap gained 10%, and Polygon\u2019s Uniswap users increased 8%.\n\nDerivatives metrics remain flat\n\nEther quarterly futures have been signaling unease among professional traders. Those fixed-month contracts typically trade at a 5% to 10% premium compared to spot markets to compensate for the delayed settlement, a situation known as contango.\n\nEther 3-month futures premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nAccording to data from Laevitas, the Ether three-month futures premium currently stands at 4%, which is below the neutral threshold and lower than the 5.5% level seen on July 14. This indicator is clear evidence that traders are less inclined to use leverage for bullish ETH positions.\n\nMore concerningly, Ether\u2019s 59% gains year-to-date might have caused investors to become overly optimistic. A recent survey from CryptoVantage of 1,000 North Americans that invested in cryptocurrencies over the past five years found that 46% named Ether as the top contender to surpass Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nRelated: Bitcoin rally will lead to \"speculative blow-off top\u201d in 2024, Mark Yusko predicts\n\nCoins with the best chances of surpassing Bitcoin. Source: 2023 CryptoVantage survey\n\nThis is a somewhat startling point of view, but it could be misleading since the survey did not ask whether any coin would eventually flip Bitcoin, so respondents don\u2019t necessarily place strong odds on this outcome.\n\nFidelity\u2019s analysis has given valid reasons for why the firm is bullish on Ether\u2019s 12-month price performance, but in the shorter term, the recurrent high gas fees and lack of interest from leverage buyers signal increased odds of the Ether price breaking below the channel support.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Following SEC Defeat, Bitcoin ETF Fever Grows as Grayscale's GBTC Surges - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nGrayscale\u2019s GBTC skyrockets amidst lawsuit against the SEC\n\nLeveraged ETFs are \u201can even riskier investment product,\u201d says Grayscale\n\nThe crypto world has been rocked by two major announcements over the last few days. First, Ripple managed to partially win its case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) following Judge Analisa Torres\u2019 decision that XRP should not be considered a security, so long as it was being sold on crypto exchanges rather than directly to investors.\n\nThe second notable headline was regarding the SEC adding BlackRock\u2019s exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to its official docket as part of its proposed rule change process. Should the application get the SEC\u2019s approval, BlackRock will be the first to initiate its spot ETF, opening the door for more applications to be approved in the future.\n\nDigital asset management company Grayscale is in litigation against the SEC as the regulating body refuses to allow Grayscale to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a spot ETF.\n\nWe\u2019ve filed a lawsuit against the SEC. $GBTC \u2014 Sonnenshein (@Sonnenshein) June 30, 2022\n\nThe news about Ripple helped trigger a surge in GBTC activity.\n\nGrayscale Vs The SEC\n\nGrayscale filed its lawsuit against the SEC on June 30th. The digital asset manager sued the regulating body for rejecting its request to convert its GBTC to a spot ETF, while approving leveraged ETFs.\n\nThe filing said: \u201cThe fact that the Commission has allowed a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP to begin trading demonstrates that the Commission continues to arbitrarily treat spot bitcoin ETPs differently than bitcoin futures ETPs.\u201d\n\nIt continued: \u201cWhile the Commission could theoretically correct its discriminatory treatment of spot bitcoin ETPs by rescinding its approval of all bitcoin-based ETPs, the Commission\u2019s apparent willingness to permit even a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP\u2014a particularly high-risk version of a bitcoin futures product\u2014makes clear that theCommission has no intention of doing so. Thus, the only way to eliminate the Commission\u2019s unequal treatment of bitcoin-based ETPs is to allow proposed spot bitcoin ETPs like Grayscale\u2019s to begin trading.\u201d\n\nJames Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, even cast his prediction regarding the lawsuit\u2019s timeline.\n\nGonna retweet this because Grayscale has already filed their APA lawsuit for the $GBTC denial. Here is our *estimated* timeline of events courtesy of @NYCStein . But things are moving fast. https://t.co/ql8a43W5vs \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 30, 2022\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Revived Hope\n\nIn the meantime, financial institutions, including the world\u2019s biggest asset management firm, BlackRock, have been continuously applying for spot ETFs. BlackRock\u2019s application has finally been added to the SEC\u2019s official docket for review.\n\nWhile that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that BlackRock\u2019s application is about to be accepted, it points towards a positive future for spot ETF applications.\n\nIn light of the news, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC daily volumes see a spike that signals its highest level in 2023.\n\nStatistics show that Grayscale\u2019s largest fund product topped $183 million on July 13. The company\u2019s second best score was on June 30th, when it topped $170.\n\nWhether the asset manager will finally have their wish of attaining a spot ETF is yet to be seen. However, the SEC is currently under heavy scrutiny by both legislators and private companies."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether rose during Wednesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Bitcoin and Ether both returned above key levels. But market sentiment remained lackluster despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accepting the second Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application for review earlier this week.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin rises past US$31,000, cryptos rally after Ripple\u2019s win against U.S. SEC\n\nBitcoin, Ether return above key levels, top 10 cryptos mixed\n\nBitcoin rose 0.75% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$30,008 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, after it dipped to a daily low of US$29,693 in the early morning.\n\nEther inched up 0.57% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,909, struggling to stay above the US$1,900 support level.\n\nThe XRP token was the day\u2019s biggest gainer, rising 5.52% to US$0.7849. The coin is up 65.3% on the weekly chart, as traders remain upbeat after the ruling that the sale of XRP did not constitute a security.\n\n\u201cThis victory marked a significant milestone as the first-ever win for a cryptocurrency company in a case brought by the SEC,\u201d Simon Schaber, the chief commercial officer of Spool DAO, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cLike the rest of this industry, the SEC is in new territory and is therefore creating new guidance and proposing new laws as it goes, which is why we\u2019re unlikely to see the end of this by 2024.\u201d\n\nMarket sentiment appeared to lack conviction, despite positive news like the SEC accepting a second spot Bitcoin ETF application for review, from asset management giant Valkyrie.\n\nThe SEC agreed the same for the application by BlackRock on July 13, which along with several other Bitcoin ETF applications set off a bullish run in crypto for the past month. BlackRock is the world\u2019s largest asset manager with US$9.4 trillion in assets. Tennessee-based Valkyrie had more than US$1 billion in assets under management in 2022.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 0.46% to US$1.2 trillion while market volume decreased 11% to US$32.28 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBitcoin NFT sales inch up, Ethereum NFT sales fall along with Opepen Edition\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.14% to 2,695.81 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and slipped 0.4% during the week.\n\nAfter a weak Tuesday, Bitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales rose 1.67% to US$1.33 million, as sales for Uncategorized Ordinals rallied 44.03% to US$851,915.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales fell after yesterday\u2019s strong session, declining 24.11% to US$11.48 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, fell 38.39% to US$323,542. CryptoPunks sales also fell 38.43% to US$472,222.\n\nThe Opepen craze also subsided, as the collection\u2019s 24-hour sales fell 59.02% to US$324,841.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on pace for another yearly low for total global transactions today, and in general, sales are pretty unremarkable across blockchains,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThe top collections are struggling to even reach US$500,000 in daily secondary sales, which is unusual to see. The index reflects a flat market.\u201d\n\nAll the Forkast Labs NFT indexes were in the red, with the Forkast POL NFT Composite sustaining the biggest daily loss of 1.76%.\n\nDespite the market slump, interest in NFTs is surging. Last week, American rapper Snoop Dogg\u2019s NFT music platform, Sound.xyz, secured US$20 million in a series A funding round led by a16z crypto, including participants like Coinbase and Scalar Capital.\n\nAsian equities fall, U.S. stock futures rise on strong earnings reports\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities were mixed as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and the Shanghai Composite inched up while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index and the Shenzhen Component declined.\n\nInvestors remained concerned about China\u2019s post-pandemic recovery, as economists believe that Beijing\u2019s plans to boost consumer spending will not translate into a meaningful boost for the economy.\n\nU.S. stock futures rose during Wednesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, bolstered by strong earnings reports. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures strengthened.\n\nU.S. financial heavyweights Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley & Co. both beat analyst estimates in Q2 earnings, lifting investor sentiment. Later on Wednesday, Tesla, Netflix, United Airlines and Goldman Sachs Group all report earnings for Q2.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99.8% chance the Fed will raise interest rates by 25 basis points at the next meeting on July 26. U.S. interest rates are now at 5% to 5.25%, the highest since 2006.\n\nThe euro inched down 0.03% to US$1.12, remaining near a 17-month high, ahead of another expected rate hike to tackle inflation. Eurozone inflation declined to a 17-month low of 5.5% in June, but core inflation remained at 5.4%, near its all-time high of 5.7% in March.\n\nThe U.S. dollar rose 0.25% to stabilize above the 100 mark, remaining near a 17-month low against the euro.\n\nSee related article: Standard Chartered\u2019s great expectations for Bitcoin in 2024\n\nUpdates with equities section"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) mining companies are employing derisking strategies by offloading BTC to exchanges, according to a market report from Bitfinex.\n\nThe cryptocurrency trading platform\u2019s latest newsletter addresses the Bitcoin mining sector at length, highlighting a recent surge in miners selling large volumes of BTC to exchanges. This has led to a corresponding increase in the value of shares in Bitcoin mining companies as institutional interest in BTC picks up in 2023.\n\nThe report notes that Poolin has accounted for the highest amount of BTC sold to the market in recent weeks. Bitfinex analysts also note that the Bitcoin mining difficulty recently hit an all-time high, which it labels as an indicator of \u201crobustness and miner confidence.\u201c The report states:\n\n\u201cMiners are clearly bullish on Bitcoin as they commit more resources to mining, hence triggering the mining difficulty, but they are hedging their position, hence the despatch of more Bitcoin to exchanges.\u201c\n\nThe report goes on to suggest that miners are hedging positions on derivatives exchanges, with 70,000 BTC in 30-day cumulative volume transferred in the first week of July 2023.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners raked $184M in fees in Q2, surpassing all of 2022\n\nWhile miners historically transfer BTC to exchanges using derivatives as a hedge for large spot positions, the report labels the high volumes as uncharacteristic:\n\n\u201cA transfer to exchanges on this scale is extremely rare and potentially showcases new miner behaviour.\u201d\n\nBitfinex also cited data from Glassnode indicating that Poolin has been responsible for a large portion of this activity, with the mining pool offloading BTC to Binance.\n\nThe analysts note that several plausible reasons could be behind recent mining behavior. This could include hedging activities in the derivatives market, carrying out over-the-counter orders or transferring funds through exchanges for other reasons.\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty and corresponding market price. Source: Blockchain.com\n\nThe increase in mining difficulty also indicates new mining power being added to the Bitcoin network. Analysts suggest that this is seen as a sign of increased network health, as well as increased confidence in the profitability of mining, either by increased BTC prices or improved hardware.\n\n\u201cThus, miners are at a peculiar situation where they are rapidly increasing their mining potential as the Bitcoin halving inches closer whilst simultaneously hedging their exposure to an extent which is higher and more cautious than previous cycles.\u201d\n\nThe report also suggests that on-chain Bitcoin movements reflect a transfer of supply from long-term holders to short-term holders. This investor behavior is said to be commonly seen in bull market conditions, as new market traders look for quick profits while long-term holders capitalize on increased prices.\n\nCointelegraph has reached out to a handful of mining companies and pools to ascertain why Bitcoin outflows from miners have increased over the past month. As recently reported, miners sent over $128 million in revenue to exchanges at the end of June 2023.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

        "title": "7 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy | Investing | U.S. News - U.S News & World Report Money",
        "content": "While there was talk of a \"crypto winter\" in 2022, it seems that spring has sprung in the digital assets space in 2023. Bitcoin, by far the largest and best-recognized cryptocurrency, has surged more than 80% year to date to regain some of its lost luster. The popular alternative cryptocurrency ether, colloquially known as ethereum, is also up almost 60% since the start of the year. (All year-to-date gains in this piece are current through July 18.)\n\nInterestingly enough, though, some crypto-related stocks are up even more \u2013 with some mining-related companies having doubled, tripled or even quintupled already in 2023. In fact, in the wake of a big court decision on July 13 that found Ripple (XRP) was not a security, some stocks immediately tacked on double-digit percentage gains.\n\nThere's admittedly a much different risk profile for cryptocurrency stocks vs. cryptocurrency itself. It's in many ways similar to the differences between owning physical gold that is tied to commodity market pricing trends and a gold miner that extracts that physical gold from the ground and is measured by its revenue, profitability and other fundamentals.\n\nIf you prefer the more tangible nature of stocks as an alternative to owning cryptocurrency like bitcoin directly, consider one of these seven names:\n\nStock Year-to-date return through July 18 Block Inc. (ticker: SQ) 25.8% Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) 195.5% Hive Digital Technologies Ltd. (HIVE) 288.9% Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. (MARA) 391.5% MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) 214.9% Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) 225.1% Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) 439.2%\n\nBlock Inc. (SQ)\n\nThough the core business of Block is its leading digital and mobile payment platform Square, co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey rebranded the company as Block in part because of his strong support for the long-term potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. This includes the company's development of Cash App, a platform where users can buy, sell, send and receive bitcoin. On top of all this, the latest quarterly filings show SQ has invested a cumulative $220 million directly in bitcoin. Shares have actually underperformed this year relative to other companies on this list, thanks to continued operations in the red along with regulatory scrutiny of Cash App. That said, aggressive investors could see this as a buying opportunity based on long-term potential.\n\nYear-to-date returns: 25.8%\n\nCoinbase Global Inc. (COIN)\n\nCoinbase provides financial infrastructure and technology for the \"crypto economy\" in the United States, including operating one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Particularly after the 2022 collapse of rival exchange FTX, Coinbase remains one of the only \"lit\" markets \u2013 a market showing the bid and ask prices of participants \u2013 providing a regulated venue in the digital assets space for domestic participants. Though the regulatory environment is always uncertain, the willingness of Coinbase to engage with the regulatory community including the Securities and Exchange Commission gives it a measure of legitimacy in an industry that is admittedly still a bit rough around the edges.\n\nYear-to-date returns: 195.5%\n\nHive Digital Technologies Ltd. (HIVE)\n\nThe smallest stock on this list at only about $500 million in market value, Hive operates as a cryptocurrency mining company in Canada, Sweden and Iceland. It recently rebranded from Hive Blockchain to Hive Digital Technologies to emphasize that it does more than just digital assets (it also offers cloud computing services). Hive also uses its tech know-how to operate data centers and offers other infrastructure solutions. It's not the first reinvention of this company either, as it was formerly known as Leeta Gold Corp., mining physical metals prior to its 2017 shift in strategy. Whatever the history though, you can't argue with the tremendous performance of this stock year to date as it benefits from its current business model.\n\nYear-to-date returns: 288.9%\n\n\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings Inc. (MARA)\n\nMarathon is currently one of the largest bitcoin mining companies in the U.S. It also provides general services to the crypto industry including transaction and custody verification as well blockchain security work. The company currently operates 150,000 or so miners at locations ranging from Texas to North Dakota to Abu Dhabi, and in July reported production of 5,120 BTC year to date in 2023. It also bills itself as one of the most sustainable miners in the world, making big investments in renewable energy such as wind power. If you are interested in investing in publicly traded bitcoin miners but don't particularly like the size of their carbon footprints, the $3 billion MARA is worth a look.\n\nYear-to-date returns: 391.5%\n\nMicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR)\n\nThough MicroStrategy's core operations include providing business intelligence, mobile software and cloud-based enterprise technology services, it has become popular these days thanks to a heavy reliance on digital assets to boost its corporate balance sheet. Back in 2020, then-CEO Michael Saylor announced his intention to stop holding cash and instead rely on crypto to fund its corporate treasury \u2013 beginning with buying $250 million worth of bitcoin. Considering bitcoin is up threefold since then, history seems to have proven out that move. And going forward, investors who want to play stocks as a proxy for direct bitcoin investment can take a stake in MSTR and its current hoard of roughly 140,000 bitcoin as of the end of its fiscal first quarter.\n\nYear-to-date returns: 214.9%\n\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA)\n\nThough it is a bit of an indirect play on the crypto frenzy, high-octane momentum stock Nvidia nevertheless earns a place on this list because of its amazing performance in 2023 and its nearly indispensable role as the semiconductor manufacturer of choice for the industry. Nvidia's legacy business of graphics processing units evolved from high-end video gaming graphics cards to \"superchips\" for data-intensive tasks like running artificial intelligence and machine learning software, performing cryptocurrency mining and other cutting-edge applications. If you're looking to play crypto stocks tangentially without owning a direct stake in bitcoin or ethereum, NVDA is a top performer worth a look.\n\nYear-to-date returns: 225.1%\n\nRiot Platforms Inc. (RIOT)\n\nRiot Platforms is a Colorado-based cryptocurrency mining company that independently mines bitcoin along with providing co-location services for institutional-scale bitcoin mining companies and other critical infrastructure for related operations. Though it previously operated as a medical device maker known as Bioptix, the company changed its name and its fundamental business model back in 2017 to ride the crypto wave. It's now valued at more than $3 billion and is one of the preeminent publicly traded mining companies."

        "title": "Bitcoin price falls to $29.5K, but on-chain data reflects investors' growing interest - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped below the $30,000 level on July 18, which retail investors may not have expected given the developments of the last month, but does the downside move represent an upcoming shift in the trend?\n\nData suggests that over the longer term, it does not.\n\nTo get to the positives first, Bitcoin price is still attempting to flip the $30,000 level to support after about 10 attempts since April of this year, but price is continuously finding buyers in the $28,000 to $25,000 range, which buyers seem to be viewing as an accumulation zone.\n\nOn-chain data from Glassnode\u2019s Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score supports this sentiment and could be a positive, depending on how investors\u2019 look at things given that the behavior of investors at $30,000 BTC price mirrors the same accumulation behavior seen in the $28,000 to $24,000 zone and the near the supposed $16,800 bottom.\n\nBitcoin Accumulation Trend Score. Source: Glassnode\n\nAccording to Glassnode, \u201can Accumulation Trend Score of closer to 1 indicates that on aggregate, larger entities (or a big part of the network) are accumulating, and a value closer to 0 indicates they are distributing or not accumulating.\u201d\n\nBasically, buyers strongly accumulated from November to December and they were heavy accumulators from March to April when BTC recaptured $30,000. The metric suggests they are doing the same in July as BTC attempts to either conquer the $30,000 resistance or received a boost from all the ETF and XRP SEC news.\n\nBitcoin is in a crab market\n\nThe current price action and derivatives market data suggest that Bitcoin is in a crab market, where price remains range bound and consolidates for a prolonged period of time. As JLabs analyst JJ the Janitor pointed out last week, a strong push through the $32,000 level would catalyze a CME gap fill from the Luna Terra-crash era.\n\nBitcoin CME Futures showcasing Luna crash CME Gap. Source: JJ The Janitor\n\nFrom the perspective of Bitcoin\u2019s weekly market structure, the $30,000 level is an important pivot point that has functioned as support in the previous bull market cycle (and now as resistance) but a grab above that level would essentially set a higher high on the longer time frame and be confirmation of a trend reversal where the next point of resistance is around the $37,000 level.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-week chart. Source: TradingView\n\nTraders\u2019 activity in the derivatives market is another factor contributing to the current crab market. Funding is down, open interest is relatively muted and besides retail plebs who are attempting to long breakouts and long lower support retests, or short breakouts and getting liquidated in both instances, a meaningful surge in these metrics that would inspire confidence that price is on the verge of some massive breakout has yet to emerge.\n\nBTC/USDT derivatives data, daily chart. Source: JJ The Janitor\n\nSure, DXY took a dip below 100 last week, but it\u2019s possibly more connected to investors reacting to the Fed\u2019s positive steps on inflation and too tight of a timeframe to expect some massive reaction from BTC immediately.\n\nThe price action in crypto exchange futures highlights degen longs and shorts trying to get ahead of price breakouts and that they are not having much success in the short term.\n\nJJ the Janitor suggests that a metric to watch is aggregate open interest, if that breaks down sharply from the current range then some true buy the dip opportunities could emerge. Currently, it\u2019s still in an uptrend, albeit sideways, but seeing a surge in OI could also be interesting and likely news, regulatory or legislative event driven.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price falls under $30K as macro and regulatory worries take center stage\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s short-term price action might raise some concern among newer investors and day-traders, the on-chain perspective remains quite compelling.\n\nThe #Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply remains at an ATH of 14.5M BTC. This suggests mature investors are preferring to accumulate Bitcoin, rather than distribute. pic.twitter.com/VkY9uTAVGG \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) July 18, 2023\n\nAt the same time, the Total Balance in Accumulation Addresses metric has also resumed its uptrend since March 16, when BTC price traded at $25,000.\n\nBitcoin Total Balance in Accumulation Addresses (BTC). Source: Glassnode\n\nReaders should also note that the metric also shows the total balance in accumulation addresses increasing since January 2022, when Bitcoin price was trading at $47,800 per coin. What is apparent is that through the worst of the crypto market collapse and Bitcoin price sell-off, multiple on-chain metrics show investors continuing to increase their allocation to BTC.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Jack Dorsey's Block is building a sci-fi style crypto wallet to keep Bitcoin safe. Here's how it works - Business Today",
        "content": "Block, the tech firm previously known as Square and led by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, is developing Bitkey, a cutting-edge crypto key product. The company is expected to roll out the new hardware later this year.\n\nBitkey is a physical, hardware-based crypto key product that serves as a self-custody wallet. It's not your typical mobile app, but an actual piece of hardware that you can hold in your hand, and it's designed to put the keys to your digital assets squarely in your control.\n\nBitkey's business lead, Lindsey Grossman, in an exclusive interaction with Business Today says a team of engineers, designers and product managers have been working on the product for many months. \"The Bitkey Beta program is the result of months of hard work and dedication from our team and the thoughtful feedback we\u2019ve received from others in the industry as well as prospective customers,\" Grossman said.\n\n\"Our aim is to create a product that empowers customers to take control of their bitcoin in a secure, user-friendly way,\" she adds. Grossman noted that Block's CEO, Jack Dorsey, is also deeply supportive of the Bitkey project. His enthusiasm stems from the product's potential to put customers in control of their money as well as the program\u2019s approach to developing in the open.\n\nGrossman also showed the product to this writer over a video call. With its sleek, futuristic design, Bitkey seems like a gadget straight out of a sci-fi film. It's designed to be more than just a novelty, though. It has the potential to serve a critical purpose in the world of cryptocurrencies by bringing ownership transparency and self-custody amid increasing regulatory oversight worldwide.\n\nUsers can purchase Bitcoin on a crypto exchange and then transfer it to their Bitkey wallet. Any transaction or transfer from Bitkey beyond a set limit the customer sets must be approved by the Bitkey device.\n\nThe user can transfer any amount to Bitkey and for money sent from the wallet, they can create a rule that any transaction above any amount they choose (let\u2019s say $20) cannot be transferred out of the wallet unless the user also approves it by signing with the hardware and then tapping to the mobile phone. In this example, let\u2019s say the user\u2019s phone gets stolen and someone can access their mobile app.\n\nWith this spending limit in place, only $20 is at risk; all the other money the customer has protected behind the additional signing requirement of the hardware which they are recommended to keep safely tucked away separate from their mobile phone on a regular basis. It's a bit like two-factor authentication banks use in the case of mobile banking, under which transactions happen only after the code that account holders receive through email or SMS is entered.\n\nGrossman says self-custody wallets such as Bitkey put the keys in the user's hands and ensure self-custody of their money. She explains that exchange-hosted wallets hold the keys on users' behalf, so the user never really owns the keys. Citing the collapse of American crypto exchange FTX last year which resulted in many investors losing their money, Grossman claims a tool such as Bitkey can protect investors in similar scenarios.\n\n\"As we saw with the FTX disaster, when things go bust, you realise you don't truly own your own money. That's why we wanted to build something that puts the keys in the hands of customers and offers them self-custody,\" Grossman explains.\n\nAlso Read: Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey mock Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Twitter-like 'Threads' over privacy concerns\n\nThe team at Block has been publicly releasing details of the product on their development blog. The minimalist design of Bitkey belies its functionality. With no screen interface on the hardware itself, Bitkey's exterior is sleek and uncluttered. The only interactive element on the device is a fingerprint sensor. For executing a transaction when the amount surpasses the user-determined spending limits, the user simply initiates a command on the mobile app and then confirms the transaction by touching the fingerprint sensor on the device and tapping the device to the mobile phone via NFC.\n\nNFC, which stands for near-field communication, allows two devices to talk to each other when they are close together. The product is what the team at Block calls a 'two out of three multi-signature Bitcoin wallet'.\n\nGrossman explains: \"We call it a two out of three multi-signature Bitcoin wallet, where there's three keys. One key is on your mobile phone, which you access via the mobile app. The second key is on the hardware device (Bitkey). And the third and final key is on Block's server. In this multi signature design, two keys are always needed to move money. The customer has two keys in their hands (mobile app and Bitkey), and Block has one on back end.\"\n\nGrossman underscores that with Block holding only one key, it can never independently facilitate the movement of money, further reinforcing the product's commitment to the principle of self-custody.\n\nWhile Grossman refused to share the possible price of the product, Block has been making strides in ensuring that there are takers for the device when it gets launched later this year. Apart from making it available to interested users of the Cash App (Block's subsidiary), Block has also signed a deal with Coinbase, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world.\n\nAccording to the company, the 'transfer' and 'buy+transfer' features with both partners will see a staggered rollout since the product is in a beta phase. But, once live, the company says customers will be able to buy bitcoin with their choice of exchange partners and immediately transfer their bitcoin to self-custody with Bitkey.\n\nAlso Read: \u2018We\u2019ll shut you down, raid homes': Twitter ex-CEO Jack Dorsey claims 'pressure' from Indian govt during farmers' protest\n\nAlso Read: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sent a Threads follow request to Twitter founder Jack Dorsey.

        "content": "Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim its psychologically important level of $30,000 as analysts predict that choppy accumulation may last for months.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) soared to a new yearly high of over $31,800 on July 13, driven by optimism surrounding the potential approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States and Ripple\u2019s landmark legal victory in its case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the classification of XRP (XRP) as a security.\n\nHowever, five days after the pump, BTC closed below $30,000 as buyers struggled to push the price back above the crucial support level.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s price showing weakness in the short term, historical on-chain movements and empirical data suggest that the worst days of the bear market are likely over.\n\nLong-term holders are unmoved, but short-term investors could sell\n\nGlassnode\u2019s latest report shows that Bitcoin\u2019s price action in the first half of 2023 was mainly dominated by short-term investors.\n\nAccording to Glassnode, 88% of short-term holders\u2019 supply is in profit, as this cohort is \u201cbecoming increasingly likely to spend and take profits.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s short-term holder SOPR ratio. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe short-term holders\u2019 profit spiked significantly after BTC took off from $25,000 after BlackRock\u2019s ETF filing instilled optimism among buyers.\n\nThe metric met resistance as its reading surpassed the 90% mark with Bitcoin\u2019s break above $31,000, suggesting that almost all short-term holders were in profit. A correction in BTC was required in the short term to reset this metric for further gains.\n\nHowever, despite the price surge in the first half of 2023, long-term investors refrained from selling. The net realized profit/loss metric reflects a noticeable difference in the levels of profit booking between the bullish phase and the current market conditions.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s net realized profit/loss metric. Source: Glassnode\n\nGlassnode\u2019s analyst wrote, \u201cThis reflects the first sustained profit regime since April 2022,\u201d which is \u201csimilar in scale to both the first half of 2019, and also late 2020.\u201d\n\nWhile selling pressure from long-term holders is minimal and the asset has witnessed on-chain positive accumulation since the start of July, the profit levels of short-term holders suggest the risk of further correction.\n\nInvestors anticipate the Bitcoin halving pump\n\nDespite the current price action, many investors and analysts still expect the upcoming Bitcoin block reward halving to positively impact price.\n\nPlanB\u2019s stock-to-flow (S2F) model shows how Bitcoin\u2019s halving affects its price. The basis of the theory is that an asset\u2019s price grows as it becomes scarce.\n\nThe stock-to-flow ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock (total supply) of Bitcoin by the annual flow (new supply). Gold has a stock-to-flow ratio of around 62, meaning newly mined coins would take approximately 62 years to equal the total amount of gold in existence.\n\nBitcoin\u2018s stock-to-flow model analysis. Source: Lookintobitcoin via Jesse Myers\n\nAs predicted in PlanB\u2019s original analysis, Bitcoin\u2019s S2F value reached parity with gold at the end of 2020. Currently, Bitcoin\u2019s S2F reading is at 57.\n\nHowever, gold\u2019s price is still 20 times higher because it has built trust over generations and Bitcoin might need \u201ca generation or even two before Bitcoin\u2019s valuation\u201d catches up to gold\u2019s, wrote independent market analyst Jesse Myers.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s S2F model was invalidated during the last cycle because BTC did not reach the model\u2019s predicted target of $100,000, Myers found that the new target of $100,000 was an ambitious upgrade to the original model.\n\nStill, the real hint lies in the first version of PlanB\u2019s S2F model from 2019, which predicted a Bitcoin price of $55,000 with an S2F of 50 after the May 2020 halving.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining difficulty hits all-time high as BTC miner selling peaks\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s price is set for another supply shock at the next halving in April 2024, the S2F model shows that the price will likely surge after the event. Still, Myers wrote the price usually follows a \u201cmuch less sexy version of the stock-to-flow model.\u201d\n\nHe also added that \u201cit takes longer than four years for the changed stock-to-flow reality of each halving to be fully digested by the world\u201d and reflected in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s updated S2F model by Jesse Myers.

Source: TradingView\n\nMore recently, the 20- and 50-period weekly moving averages staged a bullish cross, as the shorter-period MA moved above the longer. Historically, Bitcoin\u2019s price has continued to form new local highs during this event, further confirming a long-term positive trend.\n\n$btc $eth Weekly 20 & 50 EMA crosses in the past.\n\n\n\nProbably nothing though pic.twitter.com/JHdu0u7GA9 \u2014 Mohit Sorout (@singhsoro) July 18, 2023\n\nThe 20-period weekly MA at $28,150 forms the first line of defense for buyers, followed by the 200-day MA at $25,940.\n\nThe risk of selling from short-term holders, who are currently sitting on historically high profit levels, could drive the price down to the above-mentioned support levels. The price should hold these support levels given the positive ongoing accumulation and strong conviction among long-term holders.\n\nBased on historical data, a parabolic bull run is not expected just yet. The market will likely witness sideways consolidation in a parallel range leading up to the next halving event.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "3 reasons why Bitcoin traders anticipate BTC price to briefly sweep the $27.5K level - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After a spectacular first half of 2023, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) appears to have stalled out, being stuck between $29,000 and $31,500.\n\nThere could be reason to believe that in the near term, the price of Bitcoin will tend to trade sideways or to the downside. This thesis can be based on three factors, with two of them involving technical analysis and the third involving fundamentals.\n\nBitcoin price resistance at $32,000 has been holding strong\n\nCharles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, recently released a market update in which he notes the significant resistance Bitcoin has failed to break through at the $31,000\u2013$32,000 level:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is trading into the most significant resistance on the chart, $32K. Despite a swath of positive news stories over the last month for the crypto industry; from the Blackrock ETF announcement, the XRP legal victory through to presidential candidate Kennedy stating he would back the US Dollar with Bitcoin today; nothing has helped Bitcoin sustain momentum above $31K.\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to state that if positive news of this magnitude doesn\u2019t translate into upward price momentum, this alone could be a bearish signal.\n\nAnalysts question whether Bitcoin's $29,500 support will hold\n\nWhile Bitcoin has not traded far below the $30,000 mark for almost a month, a lack of resistance beneath $29,500 indicates that a breakout to the downside from the current consolidation could lead to further decline.\n\nAs crypto market commentator Colin Talks Crypto has pointed out, the next major support levels for BTC/USD don\u2019t kick in until somewhere around the $27,500 level. Not only does this level act as support based on previous price action, but both the 200-week moving average (MA) and the 200-day MA have begun to converge just beneath it.\n\n#Bitcoin looks to have a fair chance of dropping to around $27.3k where there is a confluence of both:\n\n\n\n1. a strong support range of previous price action (orange rectangle)\n\n2. where the 200 weekly MA (pink) acts as support.\n\n3. The 200 daily MA (blue) isn't far behind either.\u2026 pic.twitter.com/aDHDMqvW7U \u2014 Colin Talks Crypto (@ColinTCrypto) July 19, 2023\n\nFor the past month, BTC/USD has been holding within a tight consolidation range. Support for this range appears around the $29,500 level. A daily close beneath support could open the path to a further move downward toward $27,500.\n\nHowever, volumes have been declining, suggesting that perhaps the recent spike downward could be less bearish than it seems. If volume picks up amid another pullback, the bears could easily take control of the market.\n\nBTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price falls to $29.5k but on chain data reflects investors\u2019 growing interest\n\nBitcoin network fundamentals have floundered\n\nThe Capriole Investments report cited earlier emphasizes that \u201cprice is only half the picture.\u201d Fundamental factors also come into play. Among those most worth considering might be metrics that pertain to questions such as:\n\nWhat\u2019s happening with on-chain flows?\n\nHow are investors allocating capital?\n\nHow does overall market sentiment and the macro environment impact Bitcoin?\n\nIs network security growing?\n\nThe Capriole Bitcoin Macro Index is an aggregate measurement of 40 fundamental Bitcoin variables, including on-chain, macroeconomic and equity market metrics. All factors have been combined into a single machine learning model.\n\nThe report concludes:\n\n\u201cThe Macro Index today remains in a period of relative value (below zero), suggesting decent long-term value for multi-year horizon investors. However, the Index just re-entered contraction. On-chain and macro fundamentals have started to trend down following a 7-week period of recovery which started at $26K in early June.\u201d\n\nCapriole Bitcoin Macro Index. Source: Capriole Investments\n\nBitcoin\u2019s long-term bull thesis is still in play\n\nDespite these near-term bearish developments, there\u2019s little reason to be concerned long-term. The next halving event is less than a year away, and positive news keeps flowing in.\n\nPerhaps most importantly of all, the hash rate has risen by 50% in the last six months alone. This suggests that the Bitcoin network is stronger than ever and continuing to grow at a lightning-fast pace.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Illustrative image of two commemorative bitcoins in front of China\u2019s national flag on a computer screen, January 8, 2022. (Photo: Artur Widak/NurPhoto/AFP)On Saturday, January 9, 2021, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. (Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto)\n\nIn two May reports, cryptocurrency-tracing firms Elliptic and Chainalysis indicated that chemical producers in China have been accepting cryptocurrencies as payment for ingredients for fentanyl, a lethal drug produced on a large scale in different countries worldwide.\n\nElliptic researchers found more than 90 China-based companies supplying fentanyl precursors. Ninety percent accept payments in Bitcoin and Tether, facilitating the laundering of billions of dollars. Seventeen of the companies even offered to provide fentanyl despite its ban in China since 2019.\n\nSeveral companies openly sold those precursors to customers in Mexico, who also paid with Tether or Bitcoin. Other companies offer a variety of other chemicals including synthetic opioid precursors, amphetamine, and methamphetamine, Elliptic indicated.\n\nThe cryptocurrency wallets of these firms received more than $27 million in thousands of transactions, with a 450 percent increase in transactions from one year to the next; a sum that allowed for the acquisition of precursors to produce fentanyl with an estimated value of $54 billion, Elliptic added.\n\nAccording to the company, chemical suppliers that accept cryptocurrencies circumvent foreign exchanges restrictions in China. This suggests the use of intermediaries, possibly from the Chinese government, to convert payments from local currency to cryptocurrencies, which would imply that the trade of fentanyl precursors with cryptocurrencies relies on services that act as entry and exit points for digital assets.\n\nThese \u201ccriminal organizations take advantage of cyberspace capabilities to coordinate and sell their products, no longer only on the darknet or deep web, but also on the open web,\u201d Yadira G\u00e1lvez, a security expert and academic at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, told Di\u00e1logo on July 3.\n\nTaking responsibility\n\nChainalysis identified cryptocurrency addresses linked to Chinese sellers of fentanyl precursors, who received more than $37.8 million in cryptocurrencies since 2018. America, Europe, and Asia, have high exposure to these chemical sellers.\n\nThe blockchain analysis of the addresses of chemical dealers coincide with fentanyl seizures at the U.S.-Mexico border, confirming regional patterns in cryptocurrency transactions related to fentanyl production identified by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Chainalysis noted.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department on April 14 sanctioned and charged individuals and entities that used cryptocurrency addresses to sell fentanyl and other illegal synthetic drugs. Wuhan Shuokang Biological Technology and China-based Suzhou Xiaoli Pharmatech are two of these organizations.\n\nThese chemical companies sold fentanyl precursors to middlemen in Latin America, who in turn marketed them to Mexican drug cartels, such as the Sinaloa cartel, for the production of illicit fentanyl destined for U.S. markets, the Treasury Department said.\n\nG\u00e1lvez pointed out that China does not recognize the seriousness of the problem and stressed that \u201ccountries must assume their responsibility in the fight against illicit substances. Over the years it has been demonstrated that international cooperation is essential to stop the production, trafficking, and distribution of these types of drugs.\u201d\n\nStrong measures\n\nOn June 23, the U.S. government took firm action against four China-based companies, filing formal indictments for manufacturing and distributing fentanyl to the Mexican cartels Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation.\n\nOne of the companies involved, Hubei Amarvel Biotech, openly advertised on its website the shipment of these chemicals to the United States and Mexico. The other three companies are Anhui Rencheng Technology, Anhui Moker New Material Technology, and Hefei GSK Trade, all of which were implicated in similar crimes.\n\nGovernments should involve the private sector, especially pharmaceutical companies and laboratories, to encourage cooperation and the fight against money laundering, Chainalysis indicated. The United States places great emphasis on Chinese companies producing precursor chemicals for fentanyl.\n\nChallenges\n\n\u201cThis poses a challenge for law enforcement and authorities, both in the fentanyl trafficking chain and in demand and consumption management, which are facilitated by the use of cyberspace for transactions by these companies and criminal organizations to get their hands on the precursors,\u201d G\u00e1lvez said.\n\n\u201cIf Latin American governments do not strengthen their capacities in investigation, dismantling of criminal organizations, and physical presence in the territories, together with international cooperation, the insecurity and violence caused by these organizations will continue to be a major problem in the region,\u201d he added.\n\nDark web markets are key to the global distribution of fentanyl and similar substances, providing valuable information on opioid trafficking with cryptocurrencies. International collaboration and regulation are essential to combat this illegal trade and safeguard global health and safety, the Chainalysis study stressed."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAn ESG focused-fund manager is challenging claims from the environmental non-profit GreenpeaceUSA that Bitcoin mining is a major source of pollution and societal harm.\n\nIn a report published last Tuesday, GreenpeaceUSA called on Bitcoin-friendly financial services companies\u2014including BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan, and others\u2014to denounce Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cclimate destruction\u201d and encourage a code change to a \u201ccleaner protocol\u201d that obviates the mining industry.\n\n\u201cAll of these companies have connections to Bitcoin and have failed to take meaningful action to solve the problem despite making climate and sustainability pledges,\u201d GreenpeaceUSA wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's a view rejected by CH4 Capital co-founder Daniel Batten, who argues that Bitcoin is a force for environmental healing, rather than harm.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing weight of evidence from those most qualified to make the assessment to suggest that Bitcoin mining helps build out the renewable grid,\u201d Batten wrote in a formal rebuttal to GreenpeaceUSA on Sunday. He cited Brad Jones, former interim CEO of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), who has spoken about Bitcoin\u2019s ability to make renewable energy operators more profitable, fundable, and stable.\n\nAccording to Batten, many of the facts and figures used by GreenpeaceUSA to demonstrate Bitcoin\u2019s environmental harm were misleading, if not outright false.\n\nGreenpeaceUSA \"uses unsubstantiated fear about 'what might happen' rather than evidence,\" he writes, saying the report is \"filled with emotive language.\"\n\nFor example, GreenpeaceUSA claimed that the mining industry is \u201cmostly powered mostly by coal.\u201d In fact, Batten notes, there are 41 known sustainably powered mining operations, and only one operation still uses a coal-related product.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFurthermore, unlike the environmental activist group's claim that Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cclimate destruction\u201d would \u201caccelerate\u201d if left unchecked, Batten presented data showing that Bitcoin\u2019s emissions are actually falling over time.\n\n\u201cEmissions are falling despite rising hashrate due to decimation of mining in Kazakhstan and other coal-based grids,\u201d explained Batten in a message to Decrypt. Such miners, he said, have relocated to more sustainably powered grids like those in Texas.\n\nHe also cited individual public mining companies, such as Marathon, which have moved their facilities from a coal-based to wind-based standard, alongside \u201cflare-gas mining that reduces the overall net emissions of the bitcoin network.\u201d\n\nBatten\u2019s fund specifically invests in companies that aim to mine Bitcoin using purified landfill gas that would otherwise be burned and pollute the atmosphere with methane emissions. The process is a win-win for both the environment and the company\u2019s bottom line, he writes.\n\n\u201cOur $400 million fund will have sufficient dry powder to finance the Bitcoin network, abating more emissions than its creating, which can end ESG FUD, the major remaining barrier for both retail and institutional adoption,\u201d Batten told Decrypt.\n\nThe Bitcoin community has been largely unwelcoming to GreenpeaceUSA\u2019s campaign, which began last year after the organization received $5 million to highlight the perils of the mining industry.\n\nWhen asked for his thoughts on the GreenpeaceUSA campaign and its backer, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, Batten refused to comment in great detail.\n\n\u201cI'll let people make up their own mind about the intentions of a chair of another altcoin giving a large sum of money to help an NGO attack a rival form of cryptocurrency in Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor's Note: This article was updated to correct Daniel Batten's name and clarify that he was responding to GreenpeaceUSA's Bitcoin mining report."

        "title": "Celsius could repay all claims if Bitcoin, Ether prices rose 2X \u2014 Simon Dixon - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius is battling a Chapter 11 bankruptcy with billions of dollars in claims made by various parties. A new estimate by the Bank of the Future suggests that the troubled crypto lender could likely repay the claims if the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) \u2014 two assets held by the firm \u2014 doubled their current market prices.\n\nSimon Dixon, the founder of Bank of the Future \u2014 a crypto-centered investment firm \u2014 tweeted the estimated price BTC and ETH would need to reach for Celsius to repay all its claims and keep all other assets.\n\nBased on the final deal with the Fahrenheit consortium, which won the bid to acquire the assets of Celsius in May, if the BTC price touches $54,879 and the ETH price reaches $3,750, Celsius could repay all claims from the price appreciation of both assets. In June, Celsius appealed in court to convert all its altcoins into Bitcoin and Ether to maximize the value of assets.\n\nEstimated price of BTC and ETH for full recovery. Source: Twitter\n\nDixon noted that these estimates are based on \u201cimperfect knowledge made by the BF [Bank of the Future] internal investment banking team with no access to privileged information.\u201d The new restructuring plan under Fahrenheit includes mining, institutional loans, investments valued at approximately $1.4 billion and $450 million in liquid crypto.\n\nThe firm also shared a comparison between Fahrenheit\u2019s recovery plans and the Blockchain Recovery Investment Consortium (BRIC) \u2014 a holding company affiliated with the Winklevoss-owned Gemini Trust \u2014 wind-down plans. The total recovery under the orderly wind-down comes to $3.519 billion, which exceeds the total assets available at $3.417 billion. This discrepancy is accounted for by the variable cost.\n\nComparison between Fahrenheit plan and BRIC wind down. Source: Twitter\n\nThe return to retail borrowers is approximately $339 million. Bank of the Future estimates suggests the recovery is about 65% for both options, which could increase to about 75%, assuming 10% of claims are unclaimed. 41.4% of recovery under the Fahrenheit plan is in equity, with the remaining 58.6% in liquid crypto. Only 12.4% of recovery under BRIC orderly wind down is in equity, with the remaining 87.6% in liquid crypto.\n\nRelated: Celsius adds over 428K stETH to Lido\u2019s lengthening withdrawal queue\n\nDixon said creditors should fight to get out of the bankruptcy proceedings before the end of 2023, or before the price of BTC and ETH hit the estimated mark. He added that to avoid \u201canother rug pull, we will need to fight hard against it if it comes up.\u201c\n\nIt is very important that we get out of Chapter 11 before #Bitcoin & $ETH approach these numbers to avoid another rug pull that we will need to fight hard against if it comes up.\n\n\n\nEstimation of the price of #BTC and $ETH (50/50 basis) at which claims may be paid in full: $BTC\u2026 pic.twitter.com/PITQV3pIGM \u2014 Simon Dixon (@SimonDixonTwitt) July 19, 2023\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: Tiffany Fong flames Celsius, FTX and NY Post: Hall of Flame"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSpot trading volumes on centralized crypto exchanges plummeted by 43% in the second quarter of 2022, new data from CoinGecko suggests.\n\nAnd Binance\u2014which has been slashing jobs as it retreats from key markets and faces civil charges in the U.S.\u2014was especially hard hit.\n\nCoinGecko's report covering Q2 indicates that the world's biggest exchange has seen its dominance slide from 62% to 51% in just three months\u2014a sign that Changpeng Zhao's constant cries of \"FUD\" aren't washing with crypto traders.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe contraction in trading volumes, which was also seen on decentralized exchanges, comes despite a 7% uptick in Bitcoin's price throughout the quarter.\n\nBinance's woes also extended to the stablecoin markets, with BUSD losing 45.4% of its market cap between April and June after the embattled exchange made True USD (TUSD) its default stablecoin. The switch saw TUSD become the biggest gainer of the quarter after $1 billion was minted on the Tron network\u2014that's a 50% rise. Tether remains firmly at the top of the list, and concluded the quarter with a 66% share of the stablecoin market.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko, things are also looking gloomy in the NFT sector, despite Bitcoin Ordinals reigniting interest in crypto collectibles. Bored Ape Yacht Club prices have recently sunk to a two-year low, down 88% from their peak in a torrid time for top-tier projects. Trading volumes among all NFTs fell 35% to $3.15 billion in Q2. And Solana\u2014which has been rocked by multiple outages in recent years\u2014saw demand crater by a jaw-dropping 79% as flagship collections migrated to Ethereum and Polygon.\n\nThere was better news for Ethereum, which has largely shrugged off the threat of Bitcoin Ordinals. CoinGecko's data says 83% of NFT trading occurred via its blockchain over the quarter\u2014but there is a chance this could start to erode as 2023 continues.\n\nAnd despite withdrawals of staked ETH being activated after a years-long wait, the total amount of Ethereum locked up by validators rallied by 30% in the second quarter\u2014hitting just shy of 24 million as a result. That's worth close to $45 billion at current market rates, and indicates crypto enthusiasts are keen to get involved in staking now there's certainty over retrieving locked-up funds.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "title": "BTC Price Analysis: Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Bitcoin price has fallen to the lower end of its almost one-month trading range between $29,800 and $31,300. Already yesterday, BTC briefly fell to as low as $29,704, only to recover to $30,306 within a few hours. At press time, BTC was again moving towards the $30,000 mark, and another fall and liquidity grab seems likely.\n\nWhile this week the macro data releases are pretty quiet, it\u2019s worth taking a look at what\u2019s happening in the Bitcoin market itself.\n\nWhy Is Bitcoin Down Today?\n\nSwissblock Insights observed a peculiar calm in the market when Bitcoin reached a new yearly high of $31.840 last week. However, the momentum quickly faded, and selling pressure increased, causing BTC to drop to the low $30ks. They highlight the narrow Bollinger Bands, stating, \u201cThe Bollinger Bands are very narrow, with only a 4.2% value difference separating the upper and lower bands. A move is brewing.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the analysts emphasize the need for a significant catalyst to inject life into the current lackluster scenario:\n\nVolatility is expected to appear on the scene, although, in the short term, we are in no man\u2019s land; liquidity remains low, open interest is still flat and shorts are nowhere to be seen. There\u2019s no command in the direction we are going, and only a significant catalyst can spice things up in this dull scenario we are in.\n\nAccording to the analysts, a breakdown of the $29.650 support level would invalidate a long setup. On the other hand, a bullish leg up $31.500 could reignite momentum and surge the price to $33,000. But for this to happen, spot demand needs to reignite strongly and longs need to enter the market, \u201cotherwise momentum will continue to fading.\u201d\n\nGlassnode, an on-chain data provider, further illuminates the current state of the Bitcoin market. Despite the temporary yearly high, they describe the market as \u201cextremely quiet\u201d, also pointing to the Bollinger Bands. This compression in volatility signals a market reminiscent of the calm observed in early January, as NewsBTC reported yesterday.\n\nFurthermore, Glassnode\u2019s analysis reveals a slow but steady inflow of capital into Bitcoin. The Realized Cap currently sits just shy at $396 billion. After hitting a cycle low at $380 billion, the metric indicates that a slow but steady stream of capital is entering the market throughout 2023.\n\nGlasnode also emphasizes that investors remain unwilling to part with their held supply, resulting in choppy market conditions similar to those seen in 2016 and 2019-20 periods. Total realized profit and loss resembles the historic trend:\n\nIf we take a ratio between total realized profit and loss, [\u2026] we can also note that a lower high in this ratio was set this week. If sustained, it may allude to similar choppy market conditions seen in both 2019-20, and again in the second half of 2021.\n\nThe analysis also highlights the profit-locking behavior among Bitcoin holders, with the majority of both short-term (88%) and long-term holders\u2019 balances (73%) held in profit. However, short-term holders are the primary entities that are active in the market.\n\nOut of the total 39.600 BTC in daily exchange inflows, 78% of this is associated with the STH cohort. This means that short term holders may have to trim their profits for the time being before selling pressure eases and the bulls can take the upper hand again.\n\nGreekLive, an options expert, explains that the Bitcoin market is still losing liquidity, which makes it highly susceptible to spikes and V-shaped recoveries:\n\nCryptocurrencies encountered a V-shaped market today, with BTC falling below $29,700 and ETH below $1,875, before rebounding in a V-shaped during Asian trading hours to regain the round number of points, but the options market barely reacted to this.\n\nThe analysis advises sellers to focus on static protection and have risk control plans for holding options until expiration. For buyers, timely profit-taking and using futures to hedge options are recommended risk management strategies.\n\nAt press time, BTC traded at $30,064.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

Discover SCENE\n\nDemocratic Presidential hopeful Robert Kennedy Jr. has two daring new policies for his eventual administration: Exempt Bitcoin (BTC) holders from capital gains tax and back the U.S. dollar and Treasury Bills with a percentage of hard currencies, such as BTC.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is among the hardest currencies and the Kennedy administration is going to encourage its proliferation and propagation,\u201d said Kennedy at a political action committee (PAC) event dubbed Heal-the-Divide.\n\nThe first of Kennedy\u2019s audacious ideas, to exempt capital gains tax when Bitcoin is exchanged for U.S. Dollars, was accompanied by a recognition of its downsides. \u201cThis will give windfall to many Bitcoiners that have a great deal of money,\u201d said the presidential candidate, but added that \u201cthe benefits dwarf the downfalls.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is a bid to counter moves from crypto-friendly countries like Switzerland, Singapore, Germany and Portugal. He thinks the tax exemption policy will spur investment, ensure citizen privacy, and incentivize top talent to stay in the United States.\n\n\u201cMy administration\u2019s mission is to make America the hub of cryptocurrency and particularly of Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the 68-year old, it will also make it more difficult for governments to \u201cweaponize currency against free speech.\u201d He touched upon the idea of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and that he intends on creating strong barriers for them to come to fruition.\n\nHe doesn't just have polarizing views on cryptocurrency.\n\nKennedy said during a Twitter Spaces event with Tesla CEO Elon Musk last month that he\u2019s \u201cconvinced\u201d the 2004 presidential election was stolen because of voter fraud and that mass shootings in the U.S. have been linked to prescription drugs. He\u2019s also recently come under fire for alleging that \u201cCOVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA spokesperson for the White House has called the claims \u201cvile\u201d and \u201cfalse.\u201d In a June survey of voters, Emerson College found that 15% of respondents said they plan to vote for Kennedy in the primary.\n\nKennedy\u2019s second Bitcoin announcement is to back both the U.S. Dollar and US. Treasury Bills with hard assets\u2013namely gold, silver, platinum and Bitcoin. His plan, however, is to \u201cstart small,\u201d backing 1% of t-bills with a combination of these assets, pointing to Bitcoin as what he considers to be \u201cthe world\u2019s hardest asset.\u201d\n\nAside from these two intrepid proposals, Kennedy didn\u2019t hold back on other views on the state of the U.S. economy. In his eyes, the major threat to America is inflation, and the Fed\u2019s decision to hike interest rates, which is \u201cwiping out poor people.\u201d He added that he wishes to see \u201csensible regulation,\u201d and for the authorities to recognize Bitcoin is not a security."

        "title": "Canaccord Genuity: Bitcoin's sluggishness is opportunity for investors - CNBC",
        "content": "The price of bitcoin has been stuck for about a month, but its chart shows it could be near the start of a new cycle, making it a good time for long-term investors to add to their positions, according to Canaccord Genuity. Bitcoin on Wednesday was hovering just below the $30,000 level it retook four weeks ago. Still, it struggled to break above that mark earlier in the year and that continues to be the case now. Both bitcoin and ether are flat for the week, down 1% for the month and up about 7% since the rally on June 21 following BlackRock's bitcoin exchange-traded fund application. Multiple closing prices for both crypto assets show their short- and intermediate-term price trends are higher and support further upside, Canaccord's technical analyst Javed Mirza said in a note Tuesday. He told investors to \"utilize pending near-term weakness to add exposure near important technical support at their 50-day moving averages.\" BTC.CM= 1Y mountain Bitcoin has been stuck at $30,000 but Canaccord Genuity sees 28% upside in the medium term Mirza said bitcoin can run another 28.3% higher from current levels, targeting $38,202, if it continues to close above $26,249 over several weeks. Investors should expect the first level of resistance at about $30,493 on the upside and the next at $31,476, he said. Should the bitcoin price turn lower, first support would be at $28,717, about the level of its 50-day moving average. The next level down would be at about $27,441, a level it has not seen in a month. For ether, he sees another 55.6% upside from current levels, targeting $2,952, if it can maintain a multiweek close of $1,935. Looking at the long term, bitcoin and ether also recently reclaimed their four-year moving averages of about $27,022 and $1,592, respectively. \"This confirms the long-term trend is now up, a strong technical positive, and is consistent with a four-year cycle taking hold in cryptocurrencies,\" Mirza wrote. Bitcoin historically has followed a four-year cycle tied to its halving events \u2014 when the reward for mining bitcoin is cut in half, as designed in the Bitcoin code, to reduce the supply of the cryptocurrency. Lately, investors have been drawing similarities between the cryptocurrency's recent behavior and its moves in the lead up to the last halving. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "title": "Why isn't smart money's effect on crypto's original promise discussed more? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Ignoring the original, utility-driven ideas introduced in the early documents on digital cash became the new normal once adopters stumbled upon a cryptocurrency price ticker. Are new price tickers a sign of innovation?\n\nThere is a critical paradox when thinking about inventions and new things. Culture influences technology, while the technology itself influences culture. This also applies to distributed ledger technology (DLT). However, the case of cryptocurrency is more curious than other innovations because it is not currently used in the way the inventor initially proposed.\n\nSome might argue that the way cryptocurrencies are currently interpreted \u2014 primarily as investments rather than transactional units for the most part \u2014 is more harmful than beneficial. Smart money helps drive these possibly malicious use cases of crypto, and the main question is \u2014 why is that?\n\nSmart money\n\nSmart money refers to financial organizations or individuals with significant resources, expertise and capital. More specifically, the money that flows in and out of central banks, funds, venture firms, or even the wallets of individual investors is smart money.\n\nThis type of capital is essential for discussions of new technologies, regardless of the industry or surrounding markets, and the phenomenon appears in various economic landscapes \u2014 everything from JP Morgan financing Thomas Edison\u2019s inventions to venture firms driving the internet startup equity bubble from 1995 to 2000.\n\nThe growth of the cryptocurrency venture capital market in terms of deal count and capital invested. Source: Galaxy Research\n\nThere are other issues that inventors and builders face when there is a lot of investor involvement, but the main concern comes from smart money utility being a limiting factor and the lack of discourse around this in the DLT space.\n\nCommon economic flaws persist in crypto markets\n\nThe problem of crypto adoption may not be as bad as it seems, as only small, tightly-knit communities are working on more attractive use cases and paths to mainstream crypto adoption.\n\nThis can force the creation of counterproductive markets where retail and institutional investors presume intrinsic value from either scarcity or thin air, and the utilitarian side of novel systems is only seen by underdog pioneers who don\u2019t have much leverage at the time. Although blockchain technology operates in a decentralized manner through peer-to-peer node interactions, even in the early days of crypto, when the whales were just appearing, potential problems such as concentration of wealth and purchasable network control began to emerge.\n\nAdditionally, the nature of cryptocurrency ecosystems, token design, their relation to fiat currency and the lack of regulation made market manipulation easier and more attractive to indulge in for malicious actors. The zero-regulation part was as appealing to institutions as it was to retail traders or criminals.\n\nWall Street Journal reported that groups of online traders who gather on messaging servers to collaborate on pump-and-dump schemes have manipulated nearly $1 billion in 2018 alone, which would be much harder to achieve in a traditional market.\n\nWhy was Bitcoin invented in the first place?\n\nConcerning crypto use cases, the token-as-an-investment feature has become so mainstream that, collectively, we hardly ever think about Bitcoin (BTC) and its alternatives as digital cash or tools for probing decentralized systems to advance our everyday lives.\n\nThe global financial crisis of 2008 and some other periods in our economic history were mostly caused by influential people in the financial world whose aims did not necessarily relate to those of the average market participant. The idea of decentralization has been considered a potential solution to the problem of market control and influence. However, as discussed, today\u2019s DLT designs still cannot protect the markets around them from manipulation.\n\nThe crucial part, however, is that technology like blockchains doesn\u2019t stagnate because of the ever-increasing involvement of smart money, which continues to push the idea that crypto works best as an investment, usually because of limited supply or just plain virality.\n\nIgnorant growth of mainstream adoption\n\nAlthough smart money brings crypto into the public eye by investing in tokens or startups, bringing more mainstream attention to the space, the downside is that newly minted crypto enthusiasts enter the space with a crypto-as-an-investment mindset.\n\nThey may then introduce crypto to their friends as a \u201cbuying opportunity\u201d while having their financial interests in the matter. This can create a cycle that vaguely resembles a horrid pyramid scheme, MLM or pump-and-dump itself without the participants realizing it.\n\nA pump-and-dump scheme. Source: LivingFromTrading.com\n\nIf early crypto adopters had focused on implementing the ideas explored in the now-famous Bitcoin white paper instead of seeing crypto as a forex market, today\u2019s cryptocurrency use cases could look very different.\n\nAn ironic part of blockchain history is that while criminals \u201cpioneered\u201d real digital cash transactions on the dark web, the rest of the world traded, kept buying or simply forgot about cryptocurrencies until they became big.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nIt is hard to say if there is a solution to this cryptocurrency abuse. It would be difficult to effectively encourage institutions to pay attention to startups building DLT systems for real-world, scalable use \u2014 just as it\u2018s difficult to convince traditional organizations or governments to adopt crypto without promising a financial return.\n\nHowever, the aforementioned underdog inventors and builders who, in recent years, have been working on things like decentralized file storage, off- and on-chain data and transaction scaling should be enormously appreciated, acknowledged and introduced to smart money as often as possible. Such a prescription might just help users shake off the idea that crypto can be little more than an investment.\n\nKirthana Devaser is an economist turned financial writer and speaker in the Web3 space.

        "title": "Top Alternatives to Bitcoin - Zilliqa (ZIL), Tradecurve (TCRV) and Chainlink (LINK) - The Economic Times",
        "content": "In this story, we explore three top alternatives to Bitcoin: Zilliqa (ZIL), Chainlink (LINK), and Tradecurve (TCRV). These coins have captured attention with their unique features, strong fundamentals, and growth potential. Let's dive into the critical aspects of each coin and why they present exciting investment opportunities in the coming year.\n\nSummary\n\nZilliqa (ZIL) releases a new update\n\nChainlink (LINK) price analysis\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) provides early buyers with an 80% ROI\n\nZilliqa (ZIL): Security and Scalability\n\nZilliqa (ZIL) is a blockchain platform that addresses many cryptocurrency scalability challenges. The native cryptocurrency of Zilliqa is crucial in securing the network, executing smart contracts, and incentivizing participants.\n\nAlso, the mainnet network update v9.2 for Zilliqa was released recently. Critically, the Zilliqa network significantly benefited from this update. In particular, by enhancing the compatibility between the Zilliqa smart contract language, Scilla, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\nCurrently, Zilliqa has a value of $0.02007 with a market cap of $318M, a drop of 2.14% overnight.\n\nChainlink (LINK): Focus on Smart Contracts\n\nChainlink (LINK) connects smart contracts with real-world data and external APIs. Smart contracts on blockchain networks often lack access to real-time information, and Chainlink (LINK) solves this problem by securely providing external data feeds. The native cryptocurrency of Chainlink incentivizes node operators and secures the network.\n\nCurrently, Chainlink is trading hands at $6.12 with a market cap of $3.2B, down 1.49% in the past day alone. However, the trading volume of Chainlink has increased by 22.46% in that same time and now sits at $116,310,694.\n\nWith the increasing adoption of smart contracts and the demand for reliable and accurate external data, Chainlink has gained significant attention from developers and enterprises. Its unique value proposition and growing ecosystem make it a compelling alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nTradecurve (TCRV): Innovative Trading Platform\n\nTradecurve (TCRV) is a comprehensive platform integrating derivatives and cryptocurrency trading. With its privacy-focused approach and innovative features, including a metaverse trading academy, negative balance protection, and level-up bonuses, Tradecurve will benefit both beginner and experienced traders.\n\nAdditionally, this borderless trading platform incorporates the best components of centralized and decentralized exchanges, so expect to see low latency, slippage-free trading, fast order execution, and more.\n\nOn Tradecurve, all users can trade all derivatives on a single account that can be created quickly, as no sign-up KYC checks will be necessary. Over 15,000 users have registered for Tradecurve so far, showcasing their faith in its long-term growth potential.\n\nThe native token of Tradecurve adds utility to the platform, providing benefits such as reduced fees and access to exclusive features. Currently, it is available for just $0.018 - an 80% surge from its starting price. With over $2.8M raised so far, Tradecurve may even overtake the likes of Huobi.\n\nAs more traders seek enhanced trading experiences and diversified investment opportunities, Tradecurve (TCRV) stands out as a promising alternative to Bitcoin - so sign up for its presale below.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve presale:\n\nClick Here For Website\n\nFollow Us Twitter\n\nJoin Our Community on Telegram\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis is an advertorial.

        "content": "Standard Chartered has forecast bitcoin will trade as high as $120,000 (\u00a393,000) by the end of 2024, as the bank reassessed a previous prediction as 'too conservative'.\n\nHaving previously predicted a 2024 peak of $100,000, the London-listed bank now thinks bitcoin could reach $50,000 by the end of this year as profits among the cyrptocurrency's miners continue to grow.\n\nBitcoin is up 80.5 per cent this year in dollar terms to $29,965, and 69 per cent against sterling to \u00a323,200.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank predict that Bitcoin could reach $50,000 by the end of the year and high as $120,000 by the end of 2024\n\nBitcoin mining is the process in which transactions are made as new bitcoins enter the circulation in a blockchain.\n\nThe purpose of mining is to validate transactions to prevent fraud, as well as adding new blocks to the blockchain ledger.\n\nBitcoin mining involves using a powerful computer to solve complex hash puzzles and in turn the first user to solve the puzzle is rewarded with bitcoins.\n\nStandard Chartered said: 'Based on their profitability, miners decide how much of the new BTC supply... reaches the market.\n\n'Increased miner profitability per BTC mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher.'\n\nThe 12 largest listed miners sold 106 per cent of newly mined bitcoin in the first quarter this year, with the figure pushed above 100 per cent as a result of stockpiles, according to the bank.\n\nStandard Chartered expects this figure to fall 'slightly below' 100 per cent for the second quarter, but a bitcoin price of $50,000 would see this fall to 20 to 30 per cent.\n\nIt said: 'That is a net annual reduction in selling of BTC 250,000 \u2013 a large number relative to bitcoin market turnover.\n\n'We previously predicted that this driver would add $10,000 to the bitcoin price; we now think this estimate is too conservative, and we therefore see upside to our end 2024 target of around $120,000.'\n\nHowever, not all investors are as confident as Standard Chartered on bitcoin's trajectory.\n\nCrypto expert Glen Goodman told This is Money the bank's $120,000 prediction 'feels like a number plucked out of the air'.\n\nGoodman said: 'Standard Chartered laid out a solid bullish case, but there are some major red flags for bitcoin we can't ignore.\n\n'US financial regulators are pummeling crypto relentlessly with court cases and investigations.\n\n'Unless they have a change of heart, it's going to get harder and harder to do crypto business in the world's richest country.\n\n'Also, many economists expect a recession next year, which could seriously depress asset markets including stocks and bitcoin.\n\n'Though if a recession encourages central bankers to reduce interest rates, that could eventually give stocks and bitcoin a boost.\n\n'The bottom line is bitcoin is at the mercy of future events. Some, like 2024's halving, are known, others, like possible recession, are unknown. So $120,000 feels like a number plucked out of the air.'"

        "content": "What is Bitcoin Profit?\n\nBitcoin Profit is a cryptocurrency trading robot that reportedly works on a highly customizable AI algorithm. Not much is known about the bot\u2019s history since its official website does not say anything about its creators. However, it seems that entrepreneurs in the FinTech industry created the product. The intelligent computer program is said to be equipped with algorithms to enable it to trade Bitcoin better than human beings.\n\nBitcoin Profit works according to the rules of auto trading robots. The automated trading software decides which buy or sell orders are placed. Calculations and probability assumptions are supposed to make it possible to make profits.\n\nBeginner crypto traders can use the default settings, which execute trades when certain Bitcoin setups. Meanwhile, more experienced traders can customize the parameters to test different strategies on the trading platform.\n\nBitcoin Profit also supports trading on multiple crypto-crypto trading pairs and is said to be 10x better than the best Wall Street trader. Of course, these claims cannot be completely verified. The automated trading platform claims to guarantee users a high win rate and a success record of more than 90%. Again, to us, this seems quite unrealistic. It monitors signals and trends in the cryptocurrency market to determine the most profitable trading approach. Also, when compared to other cryptocurrency robots, Bitcoin Profit claims to be 0.01 seconds faster. Bitcoin Profit has automated and manual modes as well.\n\nBitcoin Profit Overview\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Robot Type: Bitcoin Robot \ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \u2705 Is It a Scam or Legit?

Together with other professional traders and software developers, John allegedly established this trading robot with cutting-edge technology. In addition, the robot was created with new traders in mind who still have zero experience trading the crypto market. The best element about Bitcoin Profit owners is that they promise to keep updating the robot to ensure it is on top of developing trends. They claim to do so by thoroughly analyzing the cryptocurrency markets and ensuring that the AI features in the robot are updated and at their best performance. Most importantly, the robot partners with tier-one regulated brokers for maximum safety.\n\nGetting Started With Bitcoin Profit\n\nAs a newbie with trading robots, you must be wondering how to get started with Bitcoin Profit. Below is a brief overview of the procedure since we will get into the in-depth process later in this guide.\n\nRegister for a Trading Account Deposit Funds Trade\n\nBitcoin Profit Markets, Assets, and Options\n\nWhat cryptocurrencies and products can you trade using Bitcoin Profit?\n\nBitcoin Profit doesn't let you trade other assets such as forex, stock, commodities, etc. The bot\u2019s only focus is on the cryptocurrency market, meaning you should consider other options if you want to diversify your trading portfolio with assets from other markets. As mentioned, the robot is beginner-friendly, and all you need to do is ensure it meets your trading needs to get started.\n\nBitcoin Profit currently supports the following cryptocurrencies and more:\n\nWhat leverage trading options are there with Bitcoin Profit?\n\nBitcoin Profit collaborates with regulated brokers to offer leveraged trading to its users. Since leverage trading uses derivative products, you do not need to own a Bitcoin wallet to store your funds. As such, fiat currency would suffice.\n\nNote: Trading with leverage is highly risky and if not done with caution, could lead to huge losses within a short time. Do not attempt leveraged trading unless you have done detailed research.\n\nWhat are the spreads on Bitcoin Profit?\n\nSimilar to its leverage options, there is not much information given about the spreads associated with Bitcoin Profit. However, the trading platform boasts of competitive spreads and promising returns compared to the industry average although these claims cannot be verified. If you're interested in spread betting, check out our guide to cryptocurrency spread betting.\n\nFees, limits, and payment options on Bitcoin Profit\n\nHow much does Bitcoin Profit cost?\n\nUnlike other trading robots, Bitcoin Profit does not have any subscription fees or commissions on its use, which means that the system is 100% free to sign up and use the demo account. However, traders need to make a minimum deposit of at least $250 in their trading account to start live trading.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Software cost: zero \ud83d\udcb0 Subscription cost: Zero\n\nWhat are the payment methods accepted by Bitcoin Profit?\n\nTo start trading with the Bitcoin Profit system, you need to make an initial minimum deposit of at least $250 using any of the following payment methods:\n\nCredit card\n\nSkrill\n\nMerchant Pay\n\nVisa\n\nMastercard\n\nSafepay\n\nGiropay\n\nThe Bitcoin Profit website does not charge any transaction or deposit fees from the above methods of payment.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Profit also charge fees and commissions?\n\nBitcoin Profit does not charge any fees or commissions on transactions. However, due to its partnership with brokerages, you might be charged some commission on your profits made from trading.\n\nBitcoin Profit trade sizes and limits\n\nThere are no trade or withdrawal limits on Bitcoin Profit, which means that the trading platform supports budgets from all types of traders. Trades and withdrawals can take place at any time although it might take up to 24 hours for your withdrawn money to reflect in your trading account.\n\nBitcoin Profit\u2019s Trading Platform\n\nHow does Bitcoin Profit work?\n\nBitcoin Profit works just like other outstanding trading robots that we have successfully tested. Bitcoin Profit performs by collaborating with brokers who carry out the trade orders by the robot through an Application Program Interface (API). Once the cryptocurrency trading robot determines the optimal point of entry or exit for trades, it sends the data to the broker.\n\nBitcoin Profit claims to have a technical analytical methodology that is able to predict details about the cryptocurrency market. However, this seems to be unrealistic. When there are price changes in the coin, the trading platform alerts its users via email or SMS. It also allows users to create real-time analytical indicators on the dashboard to boost their crypto understanding.\n\nWhat devices can I use Bitcoin Profit on?\n\nYou can use Bitcoin Profit on all devices. The service has a website and can be used on:\n\nMobile phones \u2013 android and iPhone\n\nTablets\n\nDesktops and laptops\n\nYou can get access to the trading platform via any web browser as long as you have a strong internet connection and a smartphone. The system has no downloadable native app.\n\nCan I Use Bitcoin Profit in My Country?\n\nBitcoin Profit is widely accessible across several countries worldwide. Check below for a more comprehensive list.\n\nCountry Is Bitcoin Profit available? Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in the UK Yes Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in Canada Yes Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in Australia Yes Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in USA No Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in South Africa Yes Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in New Zealand Yes Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in Philippines Yes Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in UAE Yes Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in Singapore Yes Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in France Yes Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in Spain Yes Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in Italy Yes Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in Germany Yes Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in Nigeria Yes Can I Use Bitcoin Profit in Mexico Yes\n\nIs Bitcoin Profit available in my language?\n\nBitcoin Profit makes it easy for users to find the information that they need in their preferred languages. The website can be translated into several languages including English, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, etc.\n\nHow easy is it to use Bitcoin Profit?\n\nUsing Bitcoin Profit is a walk in the park. Since the platform is intuitive, users do not need to have advanced knowledge of fundamental or technical analysis. The system makes it easy to access apps and trading with your account manager should not present any difficulties. However, this is not an indication of what your profits or losses will be as that depends on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHow much profit can you make using Bitcoin Profit?\n\nBased on user reviews and testimonials on Trustpilot and Reddit, Bitcoin Profit can generate daily profits starting from $1,500. However, the amount of profit you can earn from the robot depends on the amount of money you invest. Plus, profits can only be guaranteed with solid trading strategies and the ability to track Bitcoin Profit\u2019s performance in managing your crypto trades.\n\nHowever, let no pressure lure you into investing more than you are willing to lose. Since losses are inevitable, always plan while considering your tax responsibilities to the IRS/HMRC.\n\nKey Features of Bitcoin Profit\n\nWhen compared to its fellow trading robots, Bitcoin Profit performs better in certain key areas. Its top features include:\n\nEasy registration\n\nSigning up on the platform only takes a few minutes and this is much faster than other platforms. Also, the website is user-friendly and little or no expertise is needed to start trading. Bitcoin Profit has a low deposit of only $250 to start trading.\n\nMarginal response advantage\n\nSince the price of cryptocurrencies is highly volatile, even a difference of split seconds could prove to be vital when it comes to making profits or losses. From our Bitcoin Profit review, the system has been reportedly built to be 0.01 seconds faster than the live market, which facilitates better opening and closing positions and ultimately more precision and profitability for traders. It is worth noting however that this claim has not been verified.\n\nBitcoin Profit has some financial and trading tools incorporated into its system, which allows every type of trader to be comfortable when carrying out their activities. This all-in-one solution ensures that you do not have to leave the automated trading software for another tool and this effectively shortens downtime and keeps you focused on trades.\n\nFree trading\n\nCurrently, many other platforms impose fees at different points of contact when using their trading robots. However, things are different with Bitcoin Profit. There are no registration, deposit, withdrawal, or trade order fees when using the website \u2013 the platform effectively eliminates all commissions, fees, and hidden expenses. However, please note that the brokers they deal with may charge you fees.\n\nBitcoin Profit Security and Regulation\n\nIs Bitcoin Profit legit?\n\nBitcoin Profit is legal in countries that allow CFD trading. This is because it partners with world-renowned brokers who adhere to stringent trading regulations. Moreover, information from its website claims that many individuals from diverse countries globally have signed up for a trading account with the robot.\n\nIs Bitcoin Profit safe?\n\nAccording to the website, the company uses high-level encryption that makes it difficult for hackers to gain access. Although, this claim cannot be verified as documentation is not provided.\n\nAre my money and I protected?\n\nIt is crucial to note that Bitcoin Profit doesn\u2019t own a digital wallet meaning that all your trading funds are stored by the regulated brokers they partner with. Do not agonize about the credibility of the brokers Bitcoin Profit cooperates with since they are highly regulated across various jurisdiction areas by top-tier authorities. Plus, the robot is highly encrypted against hacking, with the aim of protecting your data and email.\n\nIs Bitcoin Profit Regulated?\n\nBitcoin Profit is integrated with regulated brokers globally. This guarantees your trading funds\u2019 safety and offers you the best trading conditions. For instance, in the UK, Bitcoin Profit partners with brokers regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). You simply need to ensure that the broker you select matches your cryptocurrency trading requirements.\n\nDo I have to verify my account with Bitcoin Profit?\n\nYes, you have to verify your trading account to enable seamless transactions. The website states that the verification process is straightforward and does not require any cumbersome documentation. With a working email, government-issued ID, and proof of residence, you can start placing trades orders within 30 minutes of receiving your order confirmation.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Profit Work? Trading Strategies and Algorithms\n\nBitcoin Profit is a cryptocurrency trading robot that reportedly works on a highly customizable AI algorithm. Keep in mind that Bitcoin Profit continues to receive excellent testimonials from users globally.

        "content": "The increase in Bitcoin is because as the size of the mining network expands\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is reaching US$32,000, owing to a significant verdict in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s continuing action against Ripple. Bitcoin is up 4% in the last 24 hours as of this writing. If Bitcoin breaks beyond US$32,000, it will be the first time since May 2022 that the dominant cryptocurrency has done so. Bitcoin has risen sharply in the last day as a federal court ruled in the long-running SEC dispute against Ripple Labs over the selling of its XRP token.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin Increasing in Value Today?\n\nThe SEC accused Ripple in late 2020 of marketing XRP as an unregistered security on public cryptocurrency exchanges. Following years of litigation, a federal court ruled on June 13 that trading XRP on public crypto exchanges did not constitute an offer of securities under federal law. The judge also decided mainly in favor of the SEC, concluding that off-exchange sales of XRP to sophisticated investors like hedge funds constituted unregistered securities transactions. The decisions were issued early in the trial, with a final decision likely soon. The SEC\u2019s interpretation of the Howey test for digital assets was the foundation for this violation.\n\nWhat Does Bitcoin\u2019s Price Increase Mean for Investors?\n\nThe main issue for investors today is whether this is just another indicator that Bitcoin has reached its bottom or if the retreat is a dead cat bounce, in which prices momentarily rise despite a longer-term bearish trend, only to continue their downward decline later. While the rebound has been encouraging, the reality is that we are in uncharted terrain in terms of many elements, including the geopolitical situation, economic data, crypto laws, and the Fed\u2019s connection to interest rates. Anybody familiar with the business understands that forecasting the short-term price movement of digital assets is relatively easy, even in the best circumstances. This is especially true in this financial climate.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

However, profits are not guaranteed. Users can set their own trading parameters if they have a trading strategy, or they can make use of fully automated trading.\n\nBitcoin Circuit Overview\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Robot Type: Bitcoin Robot \ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \ud83d\ude80 Claimed Win Rate: 88% \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: 2% commission on profits \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: None \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: None \ud83d\udcb0 Software cost: Free \u231b Withdrawal Timeframe: 24 - 48 Hours \ud83d\udcb1 Supported Cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, BCH, XRP, LTC \ud83d\udcb2 Supported Fiats: USD, EUR, GBP, CHF \ud83d\udcca Leverage: 1000:1 \ud83d\udcf1 Native Mobile App: No \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Free Demo Account: Yes \ud83c\udfa7 Customer Support: Email, Phone, Online Form \u2705 Verification required: KYC \ud83d\udd01 Automated Trading: Yes \ud83d\udcc8 CFD Available Yes\n\nPros And Cons Of Using Bitcoin Circuit\n\nPros Fast, no-nonsense account registration\n\nIntuitive user interface\n\nDemo trading options\n\nAccount manager support\n\nVarious charts and tools Cons Some fake reviews online\n\nAuto trading bots and leveraged trades are risky\n\nOnly available in some jurisdictions\n\nWho is The Bitcoin Circuit Owner?\n\nBitcoin Circuit was allegedly developed by two brothers with an interest in Math and the market in general.

Those with little experience in the cryptocurrency market should be able to use Bitcoin Circuit to automate trading activities and increase their understanding of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nOn the Bitcoin Circuit website, the owners say that the bot is constantly updated based on market trends for a better experience. As the website doesn't name the owners, we can't be certain who they are or what experience they have.\n\nGetting Started With Bitcoin Circuit\n\nBelow is a brief overview of how to get started with Bitcoin Circuit. We'll go into more detail later in this review.\n\nGo to Bitcoin Circuit\u2019s official website and register for an account Deposit a minimum of $250 as per the bot\u2019s requirements Customize Bitcoin Circuit and trade.

These include:\n\nAdditionally, the robot allows forex trading, thus hosting plenty of fiat currencies, including USD, EUR, CHF, etc. On Bitcoin Circuit you cannot trade other financial instrument classes besides cryptocurrencies and forex.\n\nWhat Leverage Trading Options Are There?\n\nBitcoin Circuit\u2019s partner brokers support margin trades on CFD (Contract for Difference) assets. When users trade CFDs, they bet on the underlying asset\u2019s value without ever owning those coins.\n\nWe could not confirm the margins on Bitcoin Circuit. However, some sources suggest 1:1000 leverage on trades with certain brokers.\n\nWe recommend caution when trading with leverage. The crypto market is volatile, and margin trades can be risky. If the market does not move in your favor, you can lose money quickly. Do enough research and only make trades you can afford to lose. Also, only experienced traders should practice leveraged trading.\n\nIf you want to know more about leveraged trading, take a look at our comprehensive guides:\n\nWhat Are The Spreads?\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find much information on Bitcoin Circuit\u2019s spreads. Different brokers will often feature varying spreads. Expect these percentages to change as the market fluctuates.\n\nFees, Limits, And Payment Options On Bitcoin Circuit\n\nHow Much Does Bitcoin Circuit Cost?\n\nThere are no commissions or spreads with Bitcoin Circuit itself, as well as no subscription, transaction, or inactivity fees. However, note that the crypto robot is connected to reputable crypto brokers with varying fees. To ensure you enjoy your experience, it is best to confirm a broker\u2019s charges and ensure they fit your budget. Most importantly, test the broker via a demo trading account to understand the costs applicable when you trade using real money.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Software cost: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Subscription cost: Zero\n\nWhat Are The Payment Methods Accepted By Bitcoin Circuit?\n\nBitcoin Circuit clients can deposit funds into their accounts via a few different methods. These include:\n\nCredit cards\n\nDebit cards\n\nVisa\n\nMastercard\n\nPayPal\n\nWire transfer\n\nBitcoin Circuit will not charge for these deposits, though your bank may add fees for the transaction. Withdrawals can take up to 48 hours until they appear in your bank account.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Circuit Also Charge Fees And Commissions?\n\nBitcoin Circuit takes a small percentage (around 2%) on any profits made using its bot-based trades. However, you will only pay commissions once you make money.\n\nBitcoin Circuit Trade Sizes And Limits\n\nBitcoin Circuit requires a minimum deposit of $250 to make your first trade. However, there is no maximum trade size. Brokers set trade limits. Consult with your broker directly to find out minimum or maximum trade limits.\n\nBitcoin Circuit Platform\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Circuit Work?\n\nBitcoin Circuit works similarly to other automated trading robots. Clients create a trading account and pair with a broker, depositing $250 to make their first trade. Users set trading parameters and determine leverage limits that match their strategy. The platform then makes trades, reportedly based on AI, algorithms, and market analysis.\n\nWhat Devices Can I Use Bitcoin Circuit On?\n\nClients can access Bitcoin Circuit on any device with a web browser. This includes Chrome or Safari. However, some users may have difficulty on mobile devices. Also, Bitcoin Circuit does not have a dedicated mobile app. You can use Bitcoin Circuit on the following devices:\n\nDesktop computers\n\nLaptops\n\niOS devices\n\nAndroid devices\n\nTablets\n\nCan I Use Bitcoin Circuit in My Country?\n\nCountry Is Bitcoin Circuit available? United Kingdom No Canada No Australia Yes USA No Africa Yes New Zealand Yes Philippines Yes United Arab Emirates Yes Singapore Yes France Yes Spain Yes Italy Yes Germany Yes Nigeria Yes Mexico Yes\n\nWhat Exchanges And Brokers Does Bitcoin Circuit Partner With?\n\nBitcoin Circuit works alongside numerous brokers who offer CFD trading. That being said, we could not find any information on specific brokers. However, you can search for reviews for your paired broker once you create an account.\n\nSome users have been connected with unregulated brokers, which are less trustworthy than regulated ones.\n\nIs Bitcoin Circuit Available In My Language?\n\nBitcoin Circuit is available in four languages:\n\nEnglish\n\nDutch\n\nNorwegian\n\nSpanish\n\nChoose your language from a menu at the top of the homepage.\n\nHow Easy Is It to Use Bitcoin Circuit?\n\nBitcoin Circuit features an intuitive interface that is easy to use and allows users to browse assets and CFDs whether they are new or experienced in the market. Clients can adjust parameters to suit their goals and try to establish greater control over Bitcoin Circuit\u2019s automatic trades.\n\nThe site has different charts to help clients make decisions. The bot will use this information independently to make trades as well, so you don\u2019t have to do any analysis if you prefer.\n\nHowever, automated trading robots are one of the riskiest ways to trade, especially when trading with leverage. Users should avoid trading with high leverage and only spend what they can afford, even if the trading platform makes it look easy.\n\nHow much profit can you make using Bitcoin Circuit?\n\nThe amount you can earn will vary based on the success (or failure) of your positions. So whilst it is possible to make money in cryptocurrency, it is also possible to lose money too.\n\nNote that Bitcoin Circuit has a claimed win rate in various locations of between 85-92%. This win rate can not be verified online. Therefore, you should be aware that it may not be correct.\n\nOverall, have a plan before activating Bitcoin Circuit to automate your crypto trades. Calculate your potential returns considering tax deductions to the IRS. Most importantly, have a trading journal to note down your progress and be open to learning from the errors you make along the way.\n\nKey Features\n\nBitcoin Circuit has several key features that help users navigate the trading platform. The robot has numerous tools and functions to help users trade CFDs from customer support to demo accounts. Some features include:\n\nIntuitive Interface\n\nBitcoin Circuit has a user-friendly interface that benefits both beginner and seasoned traders. View CFD contracts, set trading parameters, and browse essential facts and figures without hassle.\n\nMarket Analysis\n\nBitcoin Circuit claims to scrutinize the market and use algorithms to decide on which trades to execute for users, whether they have established their own trading criteria or prefer to go fully automated. The bot uses the most recent data to execute informed trades.\n\nDemo Trader Account\n\nBitcoin Circuit (like many other trading platforms) has a demo trading account so users can practice making trades with leverage before risking their funds. This is a great way to decide if the site is right for you and develop a strategy.\n\nSecurity And Regulation\n\nIs Bitcoin Circuit Legit?\n\nBitcoin Circuit\u2019s legitimacy is dubious. Several reviews online claim the website is a scam, and users may lose their deposit within 24 hours.\n\nIn addition, some claims suggest that Bitcoin Circuit pairs users with unregulated brokers. However, the website states that you will be paired with a certified broker without detailing who certifies them.\n\nTrading CFDs may be risky if you are new to crypto trading. If you want to use a bot (due to lack of experience), set trading criteria to match your strategy and only deposit what you can afford to lose. We suggest reading a wide selection of reviews on any trading platform before adding funds.\n\nIs Bitcoin Circuit Safe?\n\nWe cannot guarantee the safety of your funds or information when dealing with Bitcoin Circuit. Users have to sign up with their broker through an account verification procedure. However, these brokers may be unregulated.\n\nThey do not mention any security features on the Bitcoin Circuit website. As such, we could not verify whether your information is encrypted or secure.\n\nAre my money and I protected?\n\nBased on information on Bitcoin Circuit\u2019s website, your trading funds are secured on brokers\u2019 platforms regulated by tier-one authorities.

We recommend only choosing trading platforms regulated by official bodies and adhering to a standard set of practices to protect your funds and information.\n\nDo I Have To Verify My Account With Bitcoin Circuit?\n\nYes. You have to verify your email address before you can use Bitcoin Circuit. You will then be paired with an accounts manager to deposit funds into your broker wallet.\n\nBitcoin Circuit claims that they accept all new client registration forms provided you follow the link in the confirmation email.\n\nYour broker may require extra KYC verification before you can start trading.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Circuit Work? Trading Strategies and Algorithms\n\nBitcoin Circuit monitors the performance of the crypto markets to identify new trends that could benefit you. It then uses the money deposited on a trading platform to execute trades on your behalf. Note that Bitcoin Circuit will only activate a trade once the preset positions for the trade have been met. Some of the trading strategies and features incorporated in Bitcoin Circuit include;\n\nMulti-device support for crypto trading\n\nDedicated account manager\n\nWide range of tools to assist with trading\n\nPrice Trend Analysis\n\nExtra Information\n\nEducational Resources\n\nThe good news is that you can access plenty of educational materials on crypto trading from the brokers Bitcoin Circuit partners with.

We highly recommend free demo accounts for beginners since it is also the best way to gauge your skill level and boost your confidence through practicing how to trade with a robot. The bot\u2019s demo account is user-friendly and a free version of the live account. However, you must register with Bitcoin Circuit and make the necessary minimum deposit to access its demo account.\n\nHow To Get Started With Bitcoin Circuit\n\nIf you still want to create a Bitcoin Circuit account, follow these steps:\n\nCreate An Bitcoin Circuit Account Go to the Bitcoin Circuit homepage and complete the sign-up form at the top of the page. Input your full name, phone number, and email. Then, confirm your email address. Speak To An Account Manager Once you have confirmed your registration, you will be contacted by an account manager who will oversee the next step of the trading process and set you up with a broker. Deposit Funds Once you have passed any KYC procedures, add the $250 deposit into your broker wallet with one of the accepted payment methods.

However, you are much more likely to lose your money than make a profit using this type of automated trading software.\n\nThe website claims two brothers (unnamed) came up with the idea for the alleged algorithm and that it was a sure-fire bet in the market. However, most clients lose their funds before making any money.\n\nThe market is highly volatile, and traders should be wary of any auto trading platform that promises good results. While manual trading can limit your chance of loss (if you are an experienced trader), you are still likely to leave this site with less money than you started.\n\nIn addition, leveraged trading is riskier still. We could not confirm the leverage margins. However, similar sites offer leverage of up to 1000%, which could land you in a lot of debt if the market does not go your way.\n\nMake sure you do your own research and trade what you can afford. If you are looking to trade with a broker as a beginner, we suggest trying the likes of eToro instead.\n\nThis is not investment advice.\n\nInformation is provided for educational purposes only and is not investment advice.

        "content": "What Is Bitcoin Pro?\n\nBTC Pro is one of the many cryptocurrency robots to take advantage of the potential financial gains that can be made in the cryptocurrency market, thanks to the Bitcoin phenomenon.\n\nThe BTC Pro auto trading platform reportedly uses sophisticated AI to power its trading bot, which is responsible for executing the trades and investments on the platform. These bots scan several regulated crypto exchanges to bring you the best deals, maximizing your chance of making a healthy profit on your investment.\n\nWhile BTC Pro is still in its infancy (Bitcoin itself is still a relatively new concept), the platform provides an opportunity to make investments based on contract for difference (CFD) trading, matching users with some of the best Bitcoin brokers available.\n\nNo matter how much knowledge you have about trading or investing, you should be able to figure out the BTC Pro concept in no time at all. When you purchase Bitcoin through BTC Pro, you will usually buy bitcoin when the market price is low, hold them until the time is right, then sell Bitcoin when the price goes up again. Bitcoin Pro\u2019s AI is said to facilitate this process, meaning you do not even need to put in a lot of work to make a passive income to sell or buy bitcoin. It sounds simple, and in many ways it is, but you should be aware that auto trading is very risky compared to other trading platforms.\n\nNote: We are using USD when talking about the minimum deposit and other sums in this article. BTC Pro does not accept Canadian dollars directly, so crypto deposits from users in Canada will get converted into USD.\n\nBitcoin Pro Overview\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Robot Type: Bitcoin Robot \ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: $250 \u2705 Is It a Scam or Legit?

The traders partnered with top software developers to ensure BTC Pro provides a quality experience. Moreover, the owners keep updating the robot to ensure all developing trends are identified, and you never miss an opportunity to make profits.\n\nThe best element about using BTC Pro to automate your crypto trades is that it partners with highly regulated brokers in Canada. With such brokers, not only are you guaranteed your funds\u2019 safety, but you get to explore other excellent features on advanced platforms. On top of that, BTC Pro has a demo account you can test strategies without to fund your account before deciding to register a trading account on the trading platform.\n\nGetting Started With Bitcoin Pro\n\nYou are probably wondering how to start with Bitcoin Pro\u2019s automated services to maximize your potential in the crypto market. Below is a brief overview of the procedures involved. It is straightforward, and you do not need guidance even with minimal experience in digital currencies.\n\nStep 1: Go to Bitcoin Pro\u2019s official website via the links we share on this page and register for an account\n\nStep 2: Fund your account per Bitcoin Pro\u2019s requirements (at least USD 250)\n\nStep 3: Adjust BTC Pro to suit your trading needs and activate it\n\nStep 4: Monitor its performance as the bot tracks the market and trades on your behalf\n\nBitcoin Pro Markets, Crypto Assets, and Options\n\nWhat Cryptocurrencies and Products Can You Trade Crypto Using Bitcoin Pro?\n\nBTC Pro supports several well-known cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. That being said, if you want to diversify your portfolio, BTC Pro is not the best option for you. Fortunately, there are other options available, including Bitcoin Prime, Quantum AI, and Bitcoin Revolution.\n\nWhat Leverage Trading Options Are There With BTC Pro?\n\nBTC Pro works with plenty of reputable brokers in the crypto game to offer account holders up to 5000:1 leverage on their trade deals. This high leverage allows users to achieve a high return rate on relatively small investments. But how does leveraging work? Well, thanks to the 5000:1 leverage, when you invest the minimum amount of $250, you can borrow up to $1.25 million for your Bitcoin investments. We would say this leverage is much higher than the average Bitcoin trading platform.\n\nThat being said, you need to be aware of the number of risks when it comes to leveraged trades. Remember only to invest what you can afford, particularly if you are new to the market.\n\nWhat Are the Spreads on Bitcoin Pro?\n\nThe spread on BTC Pro will vary depending on your broker and the crypto exchange rate. Due to the market\u2019s volatility, you should expect some fluctuation regarding Bitcoin\u2019s buying and selling price.\n\nFees, Limits, and Payment Options on Bitcoin Pro\n\nHow Much Does BTC Pro Cost?\n\nBesides Bitcoin Pro\u2019s minimum deposit requirement, you will enjoy other services free of charge. There are no transaction, subscription, trading fees, or inactivity fees. For this reason, we recommend BTC Pro to low-budget Bitcoin traders. However, ensure you also find a broker that fits your budget to enjoy your experience.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Minimum Deposit: CA 250 \ud83d\udcb0 Trading Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Account Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit/Withdrawal Fees: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Software Cost: Zero \ud83d\udcb0 Subscription Cost: Zero\n\nWhat Are the Payment Methods Accepted by Bitcoin Pro?\n\nYou can use several payment methods when trading on BTC Pro. These include:\n\nPayPal\n\nMastercard\n\nVisa\n\nAnd many others\n\nDoes Bitcoin Pro Also Charge Fees and Commissions?\n\nAs we have already said, the BTC Pro auto trading robot does not charge any fees to open your account other than the minimum deposit required to make your first trade. You only have to pay a fee when BTC Pro takes a commission from your profits. Rest assured, you\u2019ll only pay these fees when you are making money.\n\nBitcoin Pro Trade Sizes and Limits\n\nAs we have already stated, BTC Pro requires a minimum deposit of $250 when investing in Bitcoin. Interestingly, BTC Pro does not have a maximum limit on how much you can invest, though we recommend starting with a manageable sum to avoid unnecessary risk.\n\nBitcoin Pro Platform\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Pro Work?\n\nBTC Pro is an auto trading platform that incorporates AI to trade real funds for cryptocurrency and helps account holders potentially achieve a passive income.\n\nBTC Pro is one of the few auto trading platforms that exclusively trade in Bitcoin CFDs.\n\nBTC Pro deploys auto trading platforms to reportedly analyze the Bitcoin market and find the best deal for you using AI technology. These trading bots will then invest your deposited funds, make purchases, and sell crypto when guaranteed a profit.\n\nBTC Pro helps you find sound crypto investments and gain traction in the Bitcoin market by reportedly using specific algorithms. These bots can scour vast amounts of information much faster than you would be able to do yourself. In addition, you don\u2019t even need to be logged in to the platform. The system will run independently so you can get on with your life while your money is invested.\n\nWhat Devices Can I Use BTC Pro On?\n\nYou can use BTC Pro on any device that has access to the internet. This includes:\n\nSmartphones\n\nTablets\n\nDesktop Browsers\n\nThe platform is easy to use. While you have to deposit funds to make your trades, BTC Pro trading platform also gives you a demo account, without to fund account, to practice trading while you get accustomed to the platform so you won\u2019t lose any money because you don\u2019t know your way around the crypto trading platforms.\n\nWhich Crypto Exchanges and Brokers Does BTC Pro Partner With?\n\nBTC Pro partners with many reputable Bitcoin brokers to find the best deals for account holders.\n\nCan I Use BTC Pro in My Country?\n\nGenerally, you can use BTC Pro in any country where trading CFD is legal, including Canada, most of Europe, Asia, and Australia. BTC Pro is particularly popular in:\n\nCanada\n\nAustralia\n\nFrance\n\nCountry Is Bitcoin Pro Available? United Kingdom No Canada Yes Australia Yes USA No Africa Yes New Zealand Yes Philippines Yes United Arab Emirates Yes Singapore Yes France Yes Spain Yes Italy Yes Germany Yes Nigeria Yes Mexico Yes\n\nIs Bitcoin Pro Available in My Language?\n\nBTC Pro is available in ten languages, which you can simply select from a dropdown menu at the bottom of the BTC Pro homepage.

For starters, BTC Pro offers a demo of the service to help you understand how the system works without risking your money. In addition, it also provides a video tutorial that explains everything you need to know about auto crypto trading platforms.\n\nHow Much Profit Can you Make Using Bitcoin Pro?\n\nMany Bitcoin traders wonder about the profits they can earn with BTC Pro. Unfortunately, the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and we advise you to keep that in mind when starting this venture. Instead, focus more on building your skills and strategy, then all other things will follow. For professional Bitcoin traders, you can earn up to USD 2,000 worth of profits daily with BTC Pro, according to some traders. Simply ensure you are armed with a solid strategy and can track the bot\u2019s performance to guarantee accuracy. Most importantly, a larger capital investment means larger profits, but you should only invest non-essential funds.\n\nOverall, we advise you to have a plan before using BTC Pro to automate your Bitcoin trades. Calculate your potential profits by factoring in capital and tax deductions to the CRA/ARQ. This way, you won\u2019t become disappointed once a trade is completed, and you can easily learn from your mistakes.\n\nBitcoin Pro Key Features\n\nBTC Pro has several features that add up to the overall Bitcoin trading experience and help users make money. These include:\n\nPayouts: When it comes to auto trading, you should always look for a reliable payout system. By this, we mean transparency from the second you invest your funds to the moment you receive the profits. BTC Pro crypto trading platform uses software that accurately calculates your investments and ensures they are consistent with your expected payout.\n\nEasy Withdrawal Process: As well as transparency in payouts, BTC Pro also offers a very efficient withdrawal process. For example, BTC Pro will generally process your withdrawal request within 12 hours, which means you\u2019ll often have your money on the same day.\n\nDemo Account: As previously mentioned, BTC Pro offers a handy demo account that lets you practise making trades without using real money. This is a great way to get a feel for the service and learn the ins and outs of the market before you take any real risks.\n\nBitcoin Pro Security and Regulation\n\nIs Bitcoin Pro Legit?\n\nAdmittedly, there are several fake review testimonials regarding the legitimacy of BTC Pro, although we have also found many genuine and positive reviews about the service.\n\nYou can also rely on BTC Pro to pair you with regulated and trustworthy brokers that will handle your funds with assurance and transparency.\n\nIs Bitcoin Pro Safe?\n\nYes, BTC Pro is safe to use. The crypto trading platform only partners with regulated brokers. In addition, all users have to complete a know-your-customer (KYC) verification procedure, confirming their identity and address before using the service. This prevents fraudulent activity on the platform. In addition, BTC Pro also uses SSL encryption to protect your personal information.\n\nThat being said, trading in general is never entirely safe. Each one comes with significant financial risk. We recommend looking for an alternative if you want more assurance that you will make a profit.\n\nAre My Money and I Protected?\n\nBTC Pro is highly encrypted to secure your data against hackers. It also complies with the KYC protocols to ensure all traders signing up for accounts on its platform are legitimate.\n\nIs Bitcoin Pro Regulated?\n\nYes, as we have already mentioned, BTC Pro crypto trading platform is regulated to ensure that its partnered cryptocurrency brokers comply with any relevant financial laws and that they will be able to handle your money with transparency.\n\nDo I Have to Verify My Account With Bitcoin Pro?\n\nYes. When you create your BTC Pro account, you will be paired with a cryptocurrency broker who will then ask for the KYC documents to prove your identity and address. For example, you\u2019ll need some sort of photo identification and a utility bill with your home address. This part of the process helps prevent fraudulent activity on the crypto trading platform.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Pro Work? Trading Strategies and Algorithms\n\nAs mentioned earlier, BTC Pro is AI-powered. It uses machine learning to pick up potentially profitable trends in the crypto market and trade on your behalf. It eliminates crypto trading on emotions, thus maximizing your potential to earn profits.

Simply click \u201ctrade now\u201d to begin.\n\nHow to Delete a Bitcoin Pro Account?\n\nIf you want to delete your BTC Pro account, there are two ways to go about it. You can delete this account from this crypto platform either through the bot\u2019s menu section or via a broker it is connected with. However, note that you will lose all your data, earnings, and open positions when you delete your account with the broker hosting BTC Pro. Therefore, ensure you understand the process before you decide to delete your BTC Pro account.\n\nHow to Withdraw Money From Bitcoin Pro?\n\nBTC Pro doesn't have a digital wallet, which is one reason it partners with regulated brokers to secure your digital assets.

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Dips Below $31,000 Following the Release of Hawkish Fed Minutes, Digitoads Poised for a 5000 ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The crypto market has been rocked by surprising events in the past few weeks, and one of them is the drastic drop in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) below $31,000. This drop follows the release of hawkish Federal Reserve minutes, which signal more rate rises in the future. This unprecedented price plunge has left many investors looking for the best crypto to invest in for stable income growth.\n\nEmerging cryptocurrencies are the surest bets for anyone looking for long-term earnings. DigiToads (TOADS) has exciting tokenomics, making it the top choice for investors. DigiToads has reached excellent presale heights as it competes with the top meme coins in the market. The ambitious project is predicted to rise by 5000% by the end of 2023. As the best DeFi project in the market, DigiToads has a sustainable plan to increase investors\u2019 wealth.\n\nThis article will explain DigiToads\u2019 exponential growth as the Bitcoin price dips.\n\nDigiToads (TOADS) is predicted to have accelerated growth by the end of the presale.\n\nDigiToads has become a top investor favorite because of its record-breaking presale rally. The meme coin has gained the attention of many crypto enthusiasts and experts as its presale rally skyrockets. The innovative DeFi project has sold over 97% of the TOADS tokens allocated to the current presale phase. In Lilypad 9, DigiToads had an ambitious run after raising $6.1 million. This presale success makes it the best ICO with promising potential.\n\nAnalysts believe TOADS has a strong market performance and will increase by 5000x by the end of the year. TOADS is an ERC20 token that employs the robust mechanics of the Ethereum blockchain network. The token\u2019s utility makes it one of the most unique cases in the crypto market. TOADS is one of the best DeFi tokens focused on helping its holders grow their wealth. With an innovative roadmap, TOADS is prepared to double the wealth of its investors.\n\nOne of the exciting offerings of DigiToads is that TOADS token holders can access the play-to-earn gaming platform, where they can earn passive income. The best ICO encourages user participation and allows them to make real money by battling with other users. The project also allows users to stake their NFTs for more rewards. The platform will enable the top investors each month to own one of the twelve Platinum Toads. This will contribute to the growth of the project\u2019s cash reserve.\n\nAs DigiToads approaches its official launch on August 21, 2023, interested investors can purchase a TOADS token at $0.047. The price of the TOADS token is poised for an exponential increase, and early investors stand the best chance to grow their portfolios to generational wealth. You don\u2019t have to search further, as DigiToads is the best crypto to invest in for massive growth and an incredible return on investment. Bitcoin (BTC) has dipped in recent market performance.\n\nBitcoin has dominated the cryptocurrency market, but recent market performances have witnessed the decline of the crypto giant. The sudden plunge in the price of Bitcoin in the last few weeks following the hawkish minutes from the Federal Reserve has fuelled new bullish behavior for the token. Experts believe Bitcoin will recover after trading below $31,000 in the past few days.\n\nBTC\u2019s trajectory has received mixed reactions from investors. The instability of the token since the beginning of the year has raised concern about its future. With recent happenings, BTC might record a revival when the SEC backs down on its legal battle with the crypto market. Conclusion\n\nDigiToads has survived market pressure to become one of the best-performing meme coins in the crypto market. As Bitcoin plunges below $31,000, DigiToads has massive hopes for investors as its presale rally reaches new momentum. The revolutionary DeFi project is positioned to rival the top meme coins in the market and will increase exponentially as it launches later in August. As a promising project, interested investors can use the promo code \u201cMINT10\u201d to get a 10% bonus on their purchases. You can start investing now to tap into this highly rewarding meme coin.\n\nVisit DigiToads Presale\n\nMint DigiToads NFTs Here\n\nBuy DigiToads NFTs on OpenSea\n\nJoin the community\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"
