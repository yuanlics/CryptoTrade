        "title": "Did bitcoin leak from an American spy lab? - The Economist",
        "content": "Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the <audio> element.\n\nT he origins of covid-19 remain unknown. Most scientists think it jumped from wild animals to humans at a meat market in Wuhan. But it is also possible it escaped from a virology research lab in the same city.\n\nNow a similar argument has broken out around bitcoin, the first and most used cryptocurrency. Bitcoin\u2019s accepted origin is that it was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous coder, who published a paper describing it in 2008 before later vanishing from sight.\n\nBut a theory circulating online holds that bitcoin was dreamed up by the National Security Agency ( NSA ), an American spy agency that also does cutting-edge cryptography research. \u201cI think it was a shuttered internal R & D project which one researcher thought was too good to lay fallow on the shelf and chose to secretly release,\u201d tweeted Nic Carter, a prominent bitcoin fan. Mr Carter and his fellow travellers think they have a smoking gun: a paper written in 1996 by NSA employees entitled \u201cHow to make a mint: the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash\u201d. And the paper cites work by a researcher named \u201cTatsuaki Okamoto\u201d.\n\nBut the paper is more smoke than gun. It is merely a survey of cryptographic ideas that might be used in digital cash. Unlike bitcoin, whose big innovation was its decentralised design, the schemes in the paper rely on an overseeing authority. It discusses the risks that electronic cash would pose to taxation and law enforcement. \u201cThus the idea that the NSA would develop a decentralised, trustless cryptocurrency as a \u2018monetary bioweapon\u2019 that would impair their own government\u2019s functions\u201d is implausible,\u201d writes David Rosenthal, a cryptocurrency sceptic, on his blog.\n\nJust another conspiracy theory, then? Almost certainly. But something similar has happened before. In 1997 it emerged that Clifford Cocks, a mathematician at GCHQ , Britain\u2019s NSA equivalent, had secretly invented a vital cryptographic technology that underlies both bitcoin and the internet in general, several years before the trio of American researchers who had been given credit.\n\nA better parallel between bitcoin and covid-19 may be that, like the virus, the cryptocurrency has proved hard to kill off. Despite a big crash last year, a bitcoin is still worth around $27,500. \u25a0"

        "content": "A new study conducted by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has shed light on the true extent of Bitcoin's impact on cross-border payments, revealing that its significance may be even greater than previously believed.\n\nAccording to a report by Reuters, the findings challenge conventional assumptions and underscore the growing relevance of Bitcoin in the global financial landscape.\n\nConducted by the organization's test lab, the study sought to comprehensively examine Bitcoin's role in cross-border transactions. While public data often provides a partial view of cryptocurrency activities, this study utilized a novel approach, including the development of a new \"global Bitcoin mapping system\" that also reportedly incorporates non-public data from private companies.\n\nDetails about the proprietary system were not provided by the report. Notably, however, it did acknowledge that its data is likely imperfect given it remains possible to use Bitcoin anonymously and without identification.\n\nThe system tracked transactions, addresses, and wallet movements to paint a more complete picture of Bitcoin's cross-border payment activities, the report said.\n\nMoreover, the study revealed that Bitcoin was increasingly being used for remittances, providing a lifeline for individuals in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. Its borderless nature and ease of use made it an attractive option for sending funds across international boundaries.\n\nThe findings of this study are expected to stimulate further discussions among regulators, financial institutions, and policymakers regarding the role of cryptocurrencies in cross-border transactions.\n\nFounded in the 1930s, the BIS is owned by member central banks, and its primary goal is to \"foster international monetary and financial cooperation.\"\n\nAs such, the report demonstrates a continued interest in Bitcoin among global central banks, some who want a stronger regulatory approach to the technology.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH): What is it and How it Works - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has emerged as a key rival in the ever-changing cryptocurrency scene. However, what exactly is Bitcoin Cash, and how does it work? This article will cast light on the essential characteristics of BCH, assisting you in understanding its importance in the world of digital currencies.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash, often known as BCH, is a cryptocurrency that arose from a heated argument among the Bitcoin community in 2017. BCH is fundamentally similar to its predecessor, Bitcoin (BTC), in that it uses blockchain technology for safe and decentralized transactions. However, there are significant features that distinguish BCH.\n\nBitcoin Cash vs. Bitcoin\n\nOne of the key differences between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin is how they handle scalability. The purpose of Bitcoin Cash was to alleviate Bitcoin's scalability difficulties by increasing the block size limit. This allows BCH to process more transactions each block while maintaining lower rates, making it more suitable for daily transactions.\n\nBitcoin Cash transfers are generally faster and less expensive than Bitcoin transactions. As a result, in the Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash battle, BCH comes out as an appealing option for people and organizations looking for effective digital payment solutions. While Bitcoin is frequently referred to as \"digital gold,\" Bitcoin Cash aspires to be \"digital cash\" - a medium of exchange for ordinary transactions.\n\nWhat Affects Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\n\nBitcoin Cash, like all cryptocurrencies, is vulnerable to a variety of factors that influence its price and adoption. Understanding these aspects is critical for anyone thinking about investing in BCH or using it in transactions.\n\nMarket Demand: Bitcoin Cash's price is heavily influenced by market demand. As more people and organizations understand BCH's utility as a digital currency, demand for it may rise, increasing its value.\n\nBCH is influenced by market mood, news, and public perception, just like other cryptocurrencies. Positive news and widespread adoption can increase sentiment, whilst bad news might cause market volatility.\n\nGovernment Regulations and Legal Developments: Government regulations and legal developments can have a big impact on the cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin Cash. Regulatory clarity and acceptability can promote trust and stability, whereas strict regulations might stifle growth.\n\nTechnological Advancements: Upgrades to Bitcoin Cash's underlying technology, such as its blockchain, might improve its functionality and security, thereby attracting additional users and investors.\n\nAdvantages of Bitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash has a number of characteristics that make it an intriguing cryptocurrency option:\n\nFast Transactions: BCH transactions are well-known for their quickness. Because of the large block size, more transactions may be processed rapidly, making it appropriate for everyday use.\n\nLow Transaction Fees: When compared to Bitcoin, BCH has lower transaction fees, making it a more cost-effective option for moving value.\n\nDecentralization: Like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash functions on a decentralized network, which reduces the danger of censorship or control by a single person or government.\n\nScalability: BCH's scalability features allow it can handle more transactions per second, assuring seamless operation during peak demand periods.\n\nRisk of Bitcoin Cash\n\nWhile Bitcoin Cash has numerous benefits, it is not without risks and challenges:\n\nFluctuation: BCH, like most cryptocurrencies, experiences price fluctuation. Its value can change dramatically over short time periods, affecting its effectiveness as a store of money.\n\nUncertainty in Regulatory Framework: Cryptocurrency regulations varies by country, and changes in legislation may affect the legality and use of BCH in different places.\n\nCompetition: Other cryptocurrencies and digital payment systems compete with BCH. Its capacity to sustain its market position is dependent on its acceptance and utility.\n\nConcerns about security: While BCH is built on blockchain technology, it is not immune to security concerns such as hacking and fraud. Users must take care to safeguard their BCH investments.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin Cash has emerged as a viable alternative to Bitcoin in the constantly expanding cryptocurrency ecosystem, delivering speedier transactions and reduced costs. It distinguishes itself by emphasizing scalability and usability for everyday transactions. However, investors and users should be aware of the inherent risks and challenges of BCH, including as price volatility and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhere can you use Bitcoin Cash?\n\nBecause of Bitcoin Cash's expanding acceptance, it has been integrated into a variety of sectors, making it more adaptable in its applications. Here are some examples of popular BCH applications:\n\nOnline Retail: Bitcoin Cash is currently accepted as payment by many online retailers and e-commerce platforms. This enables customers to utilize BCH to make purchases, broadening its application beyond traditional fiat currencies.\n\nPeer-to-Peer Transactions: Due to its low transaction fees and quick confirmation times, Bitcoin Cash is an excellent alternative to peer-to-peer electronic cash transactions. BCH is a great choice for sending money to a friend or paying for services.\n\nGaming and entertainment have embraced Bitcoin Cash, allowing users to use BCH to purchase in-game products, access content, and participate in online gaming communities.\n\nRemittances: Because of its worldwide reach and minimal fees, Bitcoin Cash is a feasible option for international remittances. Users can transmit money quickly and cheaply across boundaries.\n\nCharitable Donations: Many charitable organizations and non-profits now accept Bitcoin Cash donations, allowing supporters to use cryptocurrencies to contribute to causes they care about.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin Cash?\n\nIf you want to buy Bitcoin Cash, there are numerous steps you may take to get started:\n\nChoose a trustworthy Cryptocurrency Exchange: Choose a trustworthy cryptocurrency exchange that allows you to trade Bitcoin Cash. BCH trading is available on popular exchanges including as Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and Bitstamp.\n\nMake an Account: Create an account on the chosen exchange. As part of the registration process, you may be required to give personal information and complete identification verification.\n\nDeposit funds into your exchange account using your preferred payment method, such as bank transfer, credit card, or another cryptocurrency.\n\nMake an Order: Once your account has been financed, go to the exchange's trading section and make an order to acquire Bitcoin Cash. You can indicate the amount you want to buy as well as the price you're willing to pay.\n\nSafe a Wallet: While you can keep your BCH on the exchange, it is best to move your funds to a safe cryptocurrency wallet for increased security. There are hardware wallets, software wallets, and mobile wallets to consider.\n\nSafe a Wallet: While you can keep your BCH on the exchange, it is best to move your funds to a safe cryptocurrency wallet for increased security. There are hardware wallets, software wallets, and mobile wallets to consider. Monitor and manage your BCH holdings by keeping an eye on the bitcoin market. Depending on your investing objectives and market conditions, you can purchase, sell, or keep BCH.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin Cash so cheap?\n\nSeveral factors contribute to Bitcoin Cash's perceived affordability when compared to Bitcoin:"

        "content": "\"So, you're looking at the ending of the Wild West period of crypto. Is that kind of what we're talking about?\" This question, posed by Kevin O'Leary during a recent discussion at Benzinga's Crypto Unlocked event, set the stage for a candid conversation about the future of cryptocurrency.\n\n\"Yes. And it's a good thing. Listen, I'm an investor. I want to see Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) at a hundred thousand dollars. It's never going to get there, ever, if it's never going to be owned by institutions. It's never going to be owned by institutions where the next crypto exchange gets sued every week. It's over. It's over. That's got to stop. And we've got to figure it out,\" O'Leary said.\n\nThe Shark Tank star and financial expert elaborated on the crucial need for institutional investment to drive the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to new heights. \"If we want institutions to get a 1% to 3% allocation so that you can start to see capital appreciation on crypto assets, we're going to need real money. We can't do it with the crypto community. It's too small. There's a fraction. It's a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the world financial system.\"\n\n\"We've got to open it up, and we've got to get rid of the role players and the fraudsters, and you know, that's over. It's just over. And it's boring too.

        "title": "The truth behind Cuba's Bitcoin revolution: An on-the-ground report - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In Cuba\u2019s capital, Havana, a Bitcoin community has emerged from an economically antagonistic environment.\n\n\n\n\u201cSatoshi didn\u2019t create Bitcoin for Cubans, but it really comes in handy for us,\u201d Forte, co-founder of the aptly named local Bitcoin organization Cuba Bitcoin, tells Magazine.\n\nCubans are turning to Bitcoin because their money is increasingly worthless. Zimbabwe, Venezuela and Lebanon often compete for media coverage about runaway inflation levels, but the Cuban peso is not far behind.\n\n\n\nThe Cuban peso has devalued so much over the last few years that carrying bags of cash is increasingly common among the rich and the poor.\n\nIn practice, even if someone bought Bitcoin at the top of the 2021 bull run at $69,000, their money is worth much less in Cuban pesos. Whereas Bitcoin dropped 80% to its bear market low, it has since recovered 100%, and the peso has devalued by 90%.\n\nThe realization that someone should swap local currency for the Bitcoin top, knowing that it will crash and they\u2019ll still retain more purchasing power, is one of the many financial wake-up calls received while working on Cointelegraph\u2019s new documentary, The Truth Behind Cuba\u2019s Bitcoin Revolution.\n\nIn 2021, I came across the article \u201cInside Cuba\u2019s Bitcoin Revolution\u201d by Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein, in which he explains how and why Cubans were utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s stateless and low-fee properties to save money and escape financial oppression.\n\nIn line with the Bitcoin mantra of Don\u2019t trust, Verify, I went to see with my own eyes what Gladstein described.\n\nCamera in hand with my trusty travel partner Paco de la India by my side, I network my way into the Cuba Bitcoin community, which now counts thousands of enthusiasts and advocates.\n\nLa Cultura Cubana\n\nFollowing one of the largest financial conferences in the world, Bitcoin Miami, in arguably the world\u2019s most capitalist arena, the United States of America, I hop across the Caribbean to Cuba, one of the few extant socialist states. The contrast hits me harder than the Cuban tropical heat.\n\n\n\nFrom the moment I landed at Havana Jose Marti International Airport, I noticed some funny quirks: doors open manually (forget automatic sensors), check-in and immigration are done on pen and paper, and the taxis are 1950s Chevrolets.\n\nA retro car in Havana\u2019s city center. (Cointelegraph)\n\nIt\u2019s common to describe visiting Cuba as a time warp. It\u2019s not hyperbole; Cuba cannot access world markets, financial institutions or trade. The United States has subjected Cuba to a trade embargo \u2014 the longest in modern history \u2014 since the island nation nationalized U.S. oil refineries in 1960.\n\n\n\nAs a result, Cuban industry, economic output and commerce lag far behind the modern world.\n\nThe embargo, coupled with more than half a century of communism, has resulted in a highly educated, extraordinarily literate but desperately poor and hungry population, many of whom possess a heartbreaking desire to leave the island, or in Spanish, to find a \u201csalida\u201d \u2014 an exit.\n\n\n\nWhy stay in a country where a taxi driver earns more than an atomic engineer \u2014 and the emaciated engineer struggles to feed their family?\n\nAdopting Bitcoin\n\nIn such an environment, it\u2019s a wonder why Cubas don\u2019t flock to Bitcoin as money that exists outside of state control. However, many Cubans are learning about and slowly turning to Bitcoin.\n\nCatrya, one of the main characters in Cointelegraph\u2019s new documentary and one of the founders of Cuba Bitcoin, explains that there could be around 5,000 Bitcoiners in Cuba, and if you include crypto enthusiasts generally, the number is higher still.\n\nCubans do not have easy on-ramps into crypto. Firstly, those with internet connections cannot sign up for Binance, Coinbase or Gemini due to their nationality. For Cuban Americans on the island, Cuba\u2019s government restricts access to American websites. Cubans buy Bitcoin peer-to-peer through Telegram or WhatsApp groups and at in-person meetups.\n\nWhat amazes me is the tiny amounts of money Cubans put aside to save money or \u201cstack sats.\u201d Saving 1,000 satoshis (less than $1 a week) is meaningful to a Cuban on $40 monthly. The Cuban peso may not be here in 10 years, but Bitcoin certainly will be.\n\nThe peer-to-peer process is straightforward, but it\u2019s not beginner-friendly, and these hurdles can hamper adoption \u2014 although they do have a silver lining, as Catrya explains:\n\n\u201cSince we\u2019re denied [access to exchanges] by default for being Cuban, we can never do KYC [Know Your Customer], so that\u2019s a good thing for us, at least in terms of privacy.\u201d\n\nBuying Bitcoin peer-to-peer and storing Bitcoin by taking ownership of the private keys is safer. Customers who trusted custodians such as FTX, BlockFi, Celsius and Vauld with their crypto were wiped out. Cubans don\u2019t have that option, and while it takes longer, it\u2019s more secure.\n\nErich Garcia Cruz, the founder of QvaPay and BitRemesas \u2014 a currency remitter using Bitcoin that boasts tens of thousands of Cuban users \u2014 says that the small but growing number of Bitcoin customers somewhat represents Cuba\u2019s fledgling internet culture.\n\nConnectivity and freedom of information\n\nCubans could get online in earnest from 2013. So, while the rest of the world was enjoying the iPhone 5C and 4G, a few lucky Cubans fortunate to access a computer could get online that year, albeit with an awful internet connection.\n\nNow, Cubans can access 3G and sometimes 4G connectivity on their phones. The tech-savvy and younger Cubans use VPNs to circumnavigate online restrictions.\n\nGenerally, the lag in internet infrastructure combined with the cost and difficulty of buying a smartphone on a frighteningly low salary means Cuba is way behind in IT.\n\nIn 2021, the World Bank reported that three-quarters of Cuba has access to the internet. But while the issue is improving, internet censorship is rife, and Cubans are repeatedly told to trust the government through state-sponsored TV, newspapers and media.\n\n\n\nIndependent media publications are classified as \u201cenemy propaganda,\u201d which is something I was made aware of a few times during my investigation. I won\u2019t share those stories here, but it\u2019s safe to say reciting such stories would\u2019ve landed me in trouble had I stayed in Cuba.\n\nTwo exiled Cuban journalists have since advised me to avoid returning to the island for some time, especially if the Cointelegraph documentary gets a lot of attention.\n\nA funny caveat to the state-run media is that some Cubans were orange-pilled by Bitcoin proponent Max Keiser. His appearances on the Russia Today news channel were approved for broadcast in Cuba. Some of Catrya\u2019s peers watched the show where Keiser bashes fiat currencies and promotes Bitcoin.\n\nAnd yet, Bitcoin is magic internet money; it lives on the web. If Cubans aren\u2019t online \u2014 or watching Russia Today \u2014 how can they know about it?\n\nOrange pill Cuba\n\nBitalion, one of the Cuba Bitcoin founders, works in telecommunications for the government. He explains that as a privileged public sector worker, he benefits from better internet connection speeds and lower online censorship levels.\n\nBitalion speaks to Paco before dinner\n\nBitalion stumbled across the Bitcoin white paper in 2014 and became infatuated with the idea of an independent, borderless currency. He rhetorically poses the question: For those fortunate Cubans who are able to travel abroad, what can they bring to the new country? The peso in their pocket, or Bitcoin in a mobile wallet?\n\nAs with the other Bitcoin advocates on the island, Bitalion volunteers his time to educate people and support Bitcoin adoption. He\u2019s also one of the handful of Cubans running a Bitcoin node. At Cuba\u2019s first-ever Bitcoin-only meetup, he demonstrates to dozens of Cubans how to pay for goods and services directly to his Lightning Network node.\n\n\n\nCruz, Forte and countless business owners explain that Bitcoin is an easy \u201corange pill\u201d to swallow, particularly for the digitally capable Cubans. You merely explain to them that nobody controls it; it\u2019s stateless money.\n\nInterviewing Forte\n\nAt face value, Bitcoin is a useful tool for a country that has been financially and economically handicapped for generations. But for Forte, Catrya and Bitalion, the ideology of Bitcoin resonates strongly.\n\nForte jokes, \u201cSatoshi didn\u2019t create Bitcoin for Cubans, but it really comes in handy for us.\u201d\n\nIn the hope of encouraging more Cubans to explore Bitcoin, the trio and the Cuba Bitcoin community host monthly educational meetups in which they explain the principles of Bitcoin and delve into its philosophy.\n\n\n\nThey recently introduced the popular Mi Primer Bitcoin (My First Bitcoin) program in the country, which is already picking up speed in El Salvador and will soon be instructed in schools nationwide.\n\nPor qu\u00e9 aceptas Bitcoin? Why do you accept Bitcoin?\n\nQvaPay\u2019s Cruz explains that Bitcoin is the financial tool that allows the small but growing number of Cuban business owners to access foreign products.\n\n\n\nRecent U.S. presidential administrations had fluctuating policies on the Cuban embargo, relaxing and tightening different aspects based on political expediency.\n\nCruz orange-pills suppliers in an attempt to open up the Cuban economy to international markets where possible:\n\n\u201cYou are accepting Bitcoin because you\u2019re dealing with a private [independent] coin. The government doesn\u2019t have access to the transactions you and you have the freedom to do whatever you want.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cfreedom,\u201d or \u201clibertad,\u201d popped up frequently as I mingled and met with Cuban Bitcoiners, crypto enthusiasts and entrepreneurs. The fact that citizens can hold money in a wallet, outside of government overreach, appealed to many Cubans whom the government has consistently let down.\n\nThe ability to store wealth on a mobile phone in a Bitcoin Lightning wallet instead of in pesos at a bank is also an efficiency gain. It means no more queues at banks to cash in money that could devalue by a few pesos over a bank holiday weekend.\n\nSpeaking with Erich Garcia Cruz. Yes, the V from Vendetta poster was intentional.\n\nCruz and three other business owners also share that accepting Bitcoin benefits holidaymakers. Adan, a nightclub, bar and restaurant owner, explains that tourists bring a lot of cash to Cuba for vacation \u2014 and that\u2019s risky.\n\nHaving Bitcoin on a mobile phone in a wallet is a safer way to travel than flashing wads of dollar bills that end up on the black market in Cuba, inadvertently supporting the illicit and sometimes dangerous black market activity of exchanging notes in public.\n\nAdan accepts Bitcoin because of the international branding the Bitcoin logo brings. It opens up his bars\u2019 doors to another potential market. Similar to El Salvador, where Bitcoin tourism has become a trend, bars and restaurants in Cuba could also attract holidaymakers to spend satoshis instead of pesos at the till.\n\nFinally, there are myriad ways in which adopting Bitcoin can lead to positive and unexpected outcomes. Mister Navi\u2019s bar and restaurant, run by Mr. Navi and his son Julian, recently began accepting Bitcoin. Following a conversation with Forte, Catrya and Bitalion, the Cuba Bitcoin group now hosts educational Bitcoin meetups at the venue.\n\nFrom right: Mr. Navi, Julian, Paco and me at Mr. Navi\u2019s\n\nI tipped one of the service staff in Bitcoin at Mr. Navi\u2019s the first day we visited. Five days later, I saw her again when we went out for dinner with Mr. Navi and Julian. She seems different \u2014 I ask her if she is OK. She confesses that she was mugged a few days ago, and the attacker stole her purse, cash and phone.\n\nTo her surprise, when she downloaded the Bitcoin Lightning app where I\u2019d tipped her, the funds magically reappeared on her new phone. On seeing her wide-eyed reaction, I tipped her again.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s clear that, for Cubans, Bitcoin could represent a critical instrument for securing their financial future in the face of runaway inflation and government interference, or as a way of opening up to embargoed markets and the international financial world.\n\nDisclaimer: The views, opinions and perspectives expressed in this article are those of the author and are not necessarily those of Cointelegraph."

        "content": "Bitcoin has rebounded following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX last November, rising over 42%.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to and after the fall, Bitcoin dipped below the $16,000 level, according to Dow Jones Market Data Group.\n\nAUTHOR DISHES ON FTX FOUNDER'S PAYMENTS TO TOM BRADY, STEPH CURRY\n\nBy Monday at 5 p.m., bitcoin notched its highest mark in almost two months when it reached $28,933.51.

It launched on Sept. 13, 2022.\n\nOver the summer, noted companies like Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest and BlackRock, with $9 trillion in assets, applied with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot bitcoin ETF, although the U.S. regulator has yet to approve a pure bitcoin ETF.\n\nBITCOIN\u2019S PROBLEM MAY BE BOND YIELDS\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % BLK BLACKROCK INC. 825.99 -3.60 -0.43%\n\nBLACKROCK'S BITCOIN SPOT ETF WILL \u2018DEMOCRATIZE\u2019 CRYPTO: CEO LARRY FINK\n\nGrayscale has also been turned away by the SEC and is suing the Wall Street watchdog over the rebuttal, while Fidelity and the CBOE have also been shot down by regulators.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price gained 6% from Oct. 1 to Oct. 2, but after failing to break the $28,500 resistance, the price dropped by 4.5% on the same day. This decline happened because of the disappointing performance of Ether (ETH) futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were launched on Oct. 2 and concerns about an upcoming economic downturn.\n\nBitcoin price index, USD. Source: TradingView\n\nThis correction in Bitcoin\u2019s price on Oct. 3 marks 47 days since Bitcoin last closed above $28,000 and has led to the liquidation of $22 million worth of long-leverage futures contracts. But before discussing the events affecting Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market, let\u2019s attempt to understand how the traditional finance industry has affected investor confidence.\n\nOverheated U.S. economy could lead to more Fed action\n\nInvestors have heightened their expectations of further contractionary measures by the U.S. Federal Reserve following the release of the latest U.S. labor market data on Oct. 3, revealing that there were 9.6 million job openings at the end of August, up from 8.9 million in July.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell indicated during a speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in August that \u201cevidence suggesting that tightness in the labor market is no longer easing could necessitate a monetary policy response.\u201d\n\nConsequently, traders are now pricing in a 30% chance that the Fed will raise rates at their November meeting, compared to 16% in the previous week, according to the CME\u2019s FedWatch tool.\n\nThe Ether futures ETFs launch falls short\n\nOn Oct. 2, the market welcomed nine new ETF products expressly designed to mirror the performance of futures contracts linked to Ether. However, these products saw trading volumes of under $2 million during the first trading day, as of midday Eastern Time. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the trading volumes fell short of expectations.\n\nEthereum futures-based ETF volumes on Oct. 2, USD. Source: K33 Research/@VetleLunde\n\nOn the debut day, the trading volume for Ether ETFs significantly lagged behind the remarkable $1-billion launch of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF. It\u2019s worth noting that the Bitcoin futures-linked ETF was introduced in October 2021 during a flourishing cryptocurrency market.\n\nThis occurrence may have dampened investors\u2019 outlook on the potential inflow after an eventual Bitcoin spot ETF. Still, there remains uncertainty surrounding the probability and timing of these approvals by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nRegulatory pressure mounts as Binance faces a class-action lawsuit\n\nOn Oct. 2, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Binance.US and Binance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao in the District Court of Northern California. The lawsuit alleges unfair competition aimed at monopolizing the cryptocurrency market by harming its competitor, the now-defunct exchange FTX.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim that CZ\u2019s statements on social media were false and misleading, particularly since Binance had previously sold its FTX Token (FTT) holdings before the announcement on Nov. 6, 2022. The lawsuit asserts that CZ\u2019s intention was to drive down the price of FTT.\n\nThe criminal case against Sam Bankman-Fried will begin on Oct. 4 in New York. Despite CZ\u2019s denial of unfair competition allegations, speculation within the crypto community continues to circulate regarding this matter.\n\nBTC\u2019s correlation to traditional markets seems higher than anticipated\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price decline on Oct. 3 appears to reflect concerns about an impending economic downturn and the potential Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy response. Furthermore, it demonstrated how closely cryptocurrency markets are tied to macroeconomic factors.\n\nExaggerated expectations for the cryptocurrency ETFs also signal that the $28,000 level might not be the consensus for investors, given the regulatory pressures and legal challenges, such as the class-action lawsuit against Binance, which underscore the ongoing risks in the space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Does Bitcoin or Crypto Mining Still Pay Off? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency mining, particularly Bitcoin mining, has long piqued the interest and investment of many. Individuals and corporations have been pulled into the field of crypto mining by the appeal of earning digital currencies by authenticating transactions on a blockchain network. However, as the crypto landscape changes and matures, the issue of whether Bitcoin or crypto mining will still be profitable in 2023 arises.\n\nCrypto Mining's Evolution\n\nTo comprehend the current situation of crypto mining, one must first identify its evolution. Mining could be done effectively with a regular computer in the early days of Bitcoin. Miners, or nodes, would utilize their processing capacity to solve challenging mathematical riddles and validate network transactions. In exchange, they were given Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, as the popularity of Bitcoin grew, so did the competition among miners. This resulted in the development of specialized hardware known as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which were developed specifically for mining. These ASICs were substantially more efficient than ordinary computers, making competition for small-scale miners increasingly difficult.\n\nBitcoin's Evolving Role: Can BTC be considered an ESG Asset?\n\nBitcoin, often described as peer-to-peer cash, digital gold, or a hedge against inflation, is beginning to emerge as an Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) asset, according to a report by professional services firm KPMG. ESG is an investment framework aimed at promoting sustainable investments, and the convergence of Bitcoin and ESG represents a compelling shift in perspective.\n\nKPMG's report challenges traditional notions surrounding Bitcoin's energy consumption and environmental impact. The report suggests that Bitcoin can serve various ESG functions, including:\n\nCreating New Markets for Renewable Energy\n\nBitcoin miners have the flexibility to utilize various energy sources worldwide, including renewable sources like hydro, wind, geothermal, and solar. By tapping into underutilized renewable energy, Bitcoin can help reduce stranded energy and encourage further investments in clean energy.\n\nStabilizing Power Grids\n\nBitcoin miners can act as an energy buffer, absorbing excess energy when the grid faces oversupply and reducing consumption during periods of high demand. This flexibility benefits power providers by preventing grid overload and maintaining price stability for consumers.\n\nReducing Methane Emissions\n\nMethane, a potent driver of climate change, is emitted during landfill decomposition. Some companies are capturing vented methane from landfills and converting it into electricity for Bitcoin mining. This process not only reduces carbon emissions but also monetizes stranded energy, potentially revolutionizing landfill operations.\n\nThese emerging use cases challenge the narrative surrounding Bitcoin's environmental impact. Additionally, more than 50% of Bitcoin's power mix now comes from renewable sources.\n\nBitcoin's growing alignment with ESG principles is gaining attention from institutional investors like BlackRock and Fidelity, as they seek regulatory approval for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Correcting outdated narratives and recognizing Bitcoin's positive contributions to environmental and social challenges will be essential to onboard investors into the digital asset economy.\n\nThe Function of Halvings\n\nThe design of Bitcoin incorporates a mechanism known as \"halving,\" which limits the number of new Bitcoins created as mining rewards by 50% every four years on average. This halving is an important part of Bitcoin's monetary policy, which is intended to imitate the scarcity of precious commodities such as gold.\n\nThe economics of Bitcoin mining are significantly influenced by halvings. Miners must rely increasingly on transaction fees to sustain profitable as rewards decline. This has boosted rivalry among miners for higher-fee transactions, which may be financially rewarding but also unpredictable.\n\nEnergy Efficiency and Electricity Costs\n\nElectricity prices are one of the most important elements determining the profitability of crypto mining. Mining hardware requires a significant quantity of electricity to operate, and the cost of electricity varies substantially by region. Miners in low-cost electricity locations have a competitive advantage over those in high-cost electricity areas.\n\nBecause of its energy-intensive nature, crypto mining has sparked increased concern over its environmental impact in recent years. This issue has prompted efforts to make mining more energy-efficient and environmentally beneficial. Some cryptocurrencies, like as Ethereum, are shifting from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which uses substantially less energy.\n\nMining Sindicates and Decentralization\n\nMany individual miners join mining pools to boost their chances of receiving rewards. Mining pools are groups of miners who pool their processing resources to maximize their total odds of mining a block successfully. When a block is successfully mined, the rewards are dispersed among pool members according on the amount of processing power they supplied.\n\nMining pools provide more constant payments, but they also raise issues regarding centralization. As larger mining pools accumulate more power, they have the ability to dominate a major section of a cryptocurrency's network, thereby compromising cryptocurrency's decentralized ideals.\n\nConsiderations for Regulatory and Legal Compliance\n\nThe regulatory climate for cryptocurrency mining differs by nation and can have an impact on its profitability. Some countries have embraced cryptocurrency mining and offer tax breaks, while others have set stringent rules or outright prohibitions on mining activity.\n\nMiners must also consider environmental rules, especially in areas where energy sources are extensively regulated or subject to environmental impact assessments. Failure to comply with regulatory obligations might result in hefty fines and legal proceedings.\n\nMarket Conditions Are Important\n\nThe profitability of cryptocurrency mining is intimately related to the state of the cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrency prices, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, can move dramatically over short time periods. Miners frequently analyze their profitability by taking into account the current market price, as well as their electricity costs and mining hardware efficiency.\n\nA bull market with rising cryptocurrency prices can dramatically enhance mining profitability because miners can earn more from mining rewards as well as transaction fees. In contrast, a bear market with declining prices can put a pressure on profitability, particularly for miners with higher operating costs.\n\nThe Function of Altcoins\n\nWhile Bitcoin mining is the most well-known, thousands of other cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins, exist. Some of these altcoins have emerged as successful mining options. They may use alternative consensus techniques, utilize less electricity, or have more favorable reward systems.\n\nMiners that want to optimize their profits frequently diversify their mining activity to include a variety of cryptocurrencies. This method can assist them in adapting to shifting market conditions and capitalizing on opportunities given by various coins.\n\nIs it still worthwhile to mine cryptocurrency?\n\nThe answer to the issue of whether crypto mining is still worthwhile in 2023 is not one-size-fits-all. Mining profitability is determined by a variety of elements such as electricity prices, hardware efficiency, market conditions, and regulatory considerations. Mining is an industry that has changed dramatically since its beginning, and success demands careful preparation, continual adaptation, and a deep awareness of the ever-changing crypto ecosystem.\n\nCrypto mining is a viable and potentially rewarding endeavor for some, particularly when tackled strategically. Others may find that the expenses and dangers outweigh the possible gains. Those considering crypto mining should perform thorough research, examine their specific circumstances, and make informed decisions that match with their financial goals and risk tolerance, just like they would with any other investment."

        "content": "Osmosis, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on Cosmos, will be bringing Bitcoin (BTC) to the namesake inter-blockchain communications (IBC) protocol together with Nomic and Kujira.\n\nAccording to an October 3 announcement during the Cosmoverse 2023 Conference, users can transfer Bitcoin to the Cosmos network via the Nomic bridge supported on Osmosis for 1.5% of the transaction value. Users then receive Nomic Bitcoin (nBTC), an IBC-compatible token issued by Nomic Chain, on a one-to-one basis. The nBTC can be bought, sold, and used to provide liquidity on Osmosis. They are also usable across more than 50 Cosmos-linked app chains. Sunny Aggarwal, co-founder of Osmosis, commented:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is in deep need of an application DeFi ecosystem, and Cosmos is in need of a base money asset that can serve as its primary store of value. Nomic will help make this long-awaited union for a Bitcoin-centric Cosmos a reality.\u201d\n\n\"The Cosmos ecosystem is too important for it to lack a seamless and secure way to receive BTC,\" added Matt Bell, CEO of Turbofish, the founder and core contributor of Nomic. \"We see today\u2019s announcement as the beginning of the most seamless and secure way to on-ramp users into the Cosmos ecosystem with BTC,\" he continued.\n\nNative Bitcoin is coming to Osmosis.\n\n\n\nGet ready for nBTC from @nomicbtc.\n\n\n\nHere's everything you need to know. pic.twitter.com/YuYX9jQamV \u2014 Osmosis \u26a1\ufe0f (@osmosiszone) October 3, 2023\n\nThe nBTC Interchain Upgrade will be released on October 27 and is expected to activate on October 30. Through a separate partnership with decentralized finance protocol Kujira, users can send BTC to the latter's Sonar wallet address and self-custody their nBTC. The same seed phrases can restore users' BTC and nBTC wallets. The nBTC can also be used as collateral to mint Kujira's native stablecoin USK and for borrowing and lending within the ecosystem. In addition, users can bid for liquidated nBTC collaterals.\n\nNomic developers say that during the early stages of nBTC's launch, there will be a hard cap of 21 BTCs for the cross-chain bridge. \"When the bridge reaches its capacity limit, applications will not be able to generate deposit addresses and users will not be able to deposit more BTC. This parameter will be controlled by Nomic DAO governance in an upcoming upgrade,\" developers wrote.\n\n#Bitcoin is coming to the Cosmos via @nomicbtc at the end of October\n\n\n\nWe want to let all you good people know the various use cases that will be immediately available on the Kujira network, so you can put your $nBTC to work when it arrives.\n\n\n\nIt's going to be tasty\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/DLx2lzz8hs \u2014 Kujira (@TeamKujira) October 3, 2023\n\nUpdate October 3, 2023, 20:20 UTC : This article has been updated to reflect comments from Osmosis co-founder Sunny Aggarwal and Turbofish CEO Matt Bell.\n\nMagazine: Singer V\u00e9rit\u00e9\u2019s fan-first approach to Web3, music NFTs and community building"

        "title": "ETF filings changed the Bitcoin narrative overnight \u2014 Ledger CEO - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Over the past 12 months, some investors learned the hard way why they needed to move their crypto offline. Those who kept Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins on crypto exchanges like FTX lost control of their assets, sometimes forever. Events drew a red line under the storied crypto adage: \u201cNot your keys, not your coins.\u201d\n\nFTX\u2019s loss was hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger\u2019s gain, however. The Bahamas-based exchange\u2019s November 2022 bankruptcy filing delivered to Ledger \u201cour biggest sales day ever,\u201d the firm\u2019s chief experience officer, Ian Rogers, told Cointelegraph, and \u201cNovember turned out to be our biggest sales month on record.\u201d\n\nParis-based Ledger has been on a strong growth curve recently, though the past year has not been without controversy. In May, for instance, the firm drew industry ire when it launched a new secret recovery phrase storage service called Ledger Recover. Still, it remains one of the best-known and most-used crypto wallet makers in the world.\n\nCointelegraph recently caught up with Rogers and Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier in New York City to discuss the new crypto climate in the United States, the latest trends in crypto storage and differences in doing business in the U.S. and Europe, among other topics.\n\nCointelegraph: Many think that the crypto/blockchain sector is still in the doldrums or moving sideways at best, but you see reasons to be cheerful even here in the U.S.?\n\nPascal Gauthier: What happened in 2023 \u2014 and went virtually unnoticed \u2014 is a change of tone regarding Bitcoin. When the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] implied that Bitcoin was a utility and/or commodity \u2014 and not a security [like other altcoins] \u2014 this triggered two things: large companies like BlackRock began their ETF [exchange-traded fund] application process, and then the media narrative around Bitcoin changed almost overnight.\n\nAs 2023 began, Bitcoin was for drug dealers, terrorists, bad for the planet, etc. \u2014 and suddenly it became completely kosher. The biggest financial institutions in the U.S. are suddenly doing Bitcoin.\n\nCT: The BlackRock application for a spot-market Bitcoin ETF was a turning point?\n\nPG: Big money is coming into crypto; it\u2019s been announced. It may take a few years to really finally arrive, but if you look at Fidelity, BlackRock, Vanguard\u2026\n\nCT: What about U.S. regulations? Aren\u2019t they still a barrier?\n\nPG: The next administration will decide the fate of crypto in the United States. If Biden stays in power, this administration could continue to be aggressive toward crypto. If it\u2019s someone else, we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nCT: Let\u2019s talk about offline storage devices. Mark Cuban said in 2022 that crypto wallets were \u201cawful.\u201d Did he have a point?\n\nPG: A lot of our early customers used our [cold wallet] product to \u201cbuy and hold.\u201d You would purchase a Ledger [device], you put your Bitcoin in it, and then you put it someplace and forget about it. But that\u2019s not what we recommend now.\n\nRecent: AI a powerful tool for devs to change gaming, says former Google gaming head\n\nToday, you can connect your wallet to Web3 and use your private keys to do many things, including buying, selling, swapping and staking crypto, as well as engaging with DApps [decentralized applications] and even declaring your taxes.\n\nCT: On a 1 to 10 scale, where would you put cold wallets today in terms of user experience (UX)?\n\nPG: For the industry, it\u2019s a three. For Ledger, maybe a four \u2014 and we\u2019re striving to be a 10. The industry has a lot to do in terms of UX and UI [user interface].\n\nIan Rogers: Your hardware-software combo today is not just about hardware and software. It\u2019s an end-to-end experience.\n\nWhen you\u2019re buying an Apple iPhone, for instance, you\u2019re not buying a piece of hardware; you\u2019re buying into the Apple experience. We would ultimately like that to be the same thing with Ledger. Our approach is to do the absolute best user experience possible without compromising on security or self-custody.\n\nCT: Still, there\u2019s these UX issues like the 24 seed words you need to recover your private key if you lose your Ledger device. Some users go to great lengths to safeguard those words, even engraving them in steel just in case their house burns down. Doesn\u2019t that sound sort of extreme?\n\nPG: It is a little backwards to have something like a metal plate in your home. It\u2019s not very 21st century. But we came up with a solution for this.\n\nGauthier (center) speaking at the Viva Technology conference. Source: X\n\nWhen you use a Ledger product, you end up with your Ledger device and a PIN code. And you will also have those 24 words that become your master password, basically. You need to keep those 24 words safe, and this is a major barrier to entry for a lot of people. They don\u2019t trust themselves with those 24 words. They don\u2019t trust themselves not to lose them.\n\nSo, we came up with a service called Ledger Recover [i.e., an optional paid subscription service provided by Coincover that is expected to launch in October] to deal with that. It allows you to shard your private key into three encrypted shards and then send them to three different custodians. They cannot do anything with the [single] encrypted shard. Only you can bring your 24 words together again if necessary.\n\nCT: Don\u2019t we already have something like that with \u201csocial recovery,\u201d where you entrust your cold wallet recovery to several friends or \u201cguardians?\u201d\n\nPG: Social recovery doesn\u2019t really work. We\u2019ve done something that resembles social recovery \u2014 but with businesses [i.e., Ledger, Coincover and EscrowTech]. You will have to present your ID if you want to initiate the shard recovery.\n\nCT: You were criticized when you first announced the Ledger Recover service in May. Then, the launch was postponed amid the \u201cbacklash.\u201d There were security concerns. People said these three shard-holding companies could reconstruct your private key.\n\nPG: There is still a lot of education to be done for people to understand really how security works. People said [at that time] that it might be a good product if it were more transparent and easier to adopt. So we didn\u2019t go live in May, as planned, in order to make the product \u2018open source,\u2019 which adds something in terms of transparency though not security,\n\nCT: But couldn\u2019t three sub-custodial companies, at least in theory, collaborate and reconstruct your privacy key?\n\nPG: It\u2019s not possible. They don\u2019t have the necessary tools necessary to decrypt and reconstruct.\n\nCT: Moving on to Ledger\u2019s business model, do you sometimes worry that as big institutions like Fidelity Investments or banks like BNY Mellon enter the crypto space that users may simply park their crypto with them? If they get hacked, those giant custodial institutions will then make them whole again. Or at least that is sometimes the thinking.\n\nPG: We\u2019re a pure technology company. So when Fidelity decides to become a [retail] crypto custodian, they\u2019ll probably come to us and buy a part of our technology to build their own technology stack.\n\nCT: Your business strides several continents. You\u2019re based in France, but you sell many of your devices in the United States. You have first-hand experience of those two business climates \u2014 the U.S. and Europe. Are there key differences when it comes to crypto?\n\nPG: Europe has a tendency to over-regulate or regulate too fast, generally speaking. Sometimes people say, well, you know, Europe has clarity because it has MiCA [Markets in Crypto-Assets, the EU\u2019s new crypto legislation], while in the U.S., there is a lack of clarity and lots of lawsuits.\n\nBut in the U.S., the way that the law is designed is slow and bumpy. It takes time to change laws in the U.S., but when change finally does come, it\u2019s often for the better.\n\nMagazine: 6 Questions for JW Verret \u2014 the blockchain professor who\u2019s tracking the money\n\nIf you look at the biggest tech champions in the world, they're mostly American or Chinese. Zero are European.\n\nCT: Are you linking heavy regulation with a lack of innovation?\n\nPG: It\u2019s hard to say if they are directly linked, but Europe has always had a heavy hand in terms of taxation and regulation.\n\nIan Rogers: To me, there\u2019s no question they are linked. At LVMH [the French luxury goods conglomerate where Rogers served as chief digital officer for five years], we worked with a lot of startups. Every European startup wanted to get to the U.S. or China to \u201cget scale\u201d before they came back to Europe. Europe is not a good market if you\u2019re a startup.\n\nCT: But Ledger remains positive about the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology overall?\n\nPG: Things are not necessarily what they seem to be. It was our [late] French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, who said: \u201cGive time for time.\u201d There\u2019s something going on now, and only the future will be able to make clear what is happening."

        "content": "El Salvador officially launched its first local Bitcoin (BTC) mining pool as the Volcano Energy project begins mining blocks through Lava Pool in partnership with Luxor Technology.\n\nThe Bitcoin-friendly country\u2019s $1 billion renewable energy project made headlines earlier in 2023, with stablecoin issuer Tether among companies investing in the project that plans to generate electricity from renewable sources in El Salvador to power future Bitcoin mining operations in the country.\n\nVolcano Energy is tapping into Luxor\u2019s experience in providing Bitcoin mining software and services. The project will also use Luxor\u2019s Hashrate Forward Marketplace to mitigate market volatility through automated risk management strategies used by other major Bitcoin mining operators.\n\nBitcoin has the potential to pay off its climate debt much sooner than solar energy, and, thanks to its ability to mitigate methane, it can address more urgent challenges. #Bitcoin #ClimateAction \u2014 Volcano Energy (@Volcano_Energy) October 3, 2023\n\nA statement from Volcano Energy chief strategy officer Gerson Martinez highlighted ongoing efforts by El Salvador to secure first-mover advantage as a Bitcoin-adopting nationstate:\n\n\u201cOur vision is to create a vertically integrated energy and bitcoin mining company whose value is accretive to investors and to all Salvadoran citizens.\u201d\n\nLuxor\u2019s chief operating officer Ethan Vera said the establishment of Volcano Energy and the start of local Bitcoin mining will contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s ethos of geographical decentralization.\n\nThe announcement also mentions the potential for countries with abundant renewable energy sources to use Bitcoin mining to improve the economics of new energy projects. Mining operations can provide a \u201cflexible buyer of first and last resort\u201d for energy producers and act as an alternative revenue stream.\n\nAs a public-private partnership, Volcano Energy is set to contribute 23% of its net income from mining operations to the El Salvador government. Mining profits are also set to be reinvested into energy transmission and infrastructure to stimulate economic and technological growth in the Central American nation.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin-friendly El Salvador sees bond returns soar to 70% in 2023\n\nThe first phase of the Volcano Energy project involves the construction of a 241-megawatt (MW) renewable energy park in Metap\u00e1n that will comprise 169 MWs of photovoltaic solar energy and 72 MWs of wind power. The long-term goal of the project is to tap into abundant geothermal energy in the country.\n\nIn a previous exclusive interview with Cointelegraph at the Money20/20 conference in Amsterdam, Tether\u2019s chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino said that the company\u2019s investment was aimed at diversifying its interests into energy production while making use of renewable energy to mine Bitcoin.\n\nCointelegraph journalist Joe Hall traveled to El Salvador in 2023, documenting the adoption of Bitcoin as a means of payment in the two years since the country became the first in the world to officially make BTC legal tender.\n\nMagazine: Blockchain detectives: Mt.

        "content": "Cryptocurrency mining in Uzbekistan faces major changes as the country\u2019s crypto market supervisor has approved a framework for licensing crypto mining operations.\n\nUzbekistan\u2019s National Agency for Perspective Projects (NAPP) issued a decree on licensing cryptocurrency mining operations, limiting such activities exclusively to legal entities.\n\nBesides banning individual miners\u2019 operations, the NAPP has also required firms to only use solar power to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). However, miners can still use the unified power system of Uzbekistan in certain cases stipulated by the legislation. The document doesn\u2019t mention what cases are meant.\n\nAmong other requirements, Uzbekistan\u2019s cryptocurrency watchdog demanded companies set up a dedicated room for installing mining equipment and only mine crypto at the registered address. The rules also require crypto mining firms to provide timely and full payment of mining fees established by regulators.\n\nAdditionally, the NAPP has banned miners from mining anonymous cryptocurrencies \u2014 those working based on anonymity and hiding transactions. The authority was referring to privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR), which allow users to obfuscate network transactions.\n\nRelated: Kazakh crypto miners plead with president to cut energy prices\n\n\u201cAll mining operations and services are only possible after obtaining a permitting document and license in the prescribed manner,\u201d the NAPP wrote, adding:\n\n\u201cThe agency also asks all citizens to act within the framework of the law and refrain from attempting to organize activities in the field of circulation of crypto-assets without obtaining the appropriate license.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the NAPP\u2019s latest crypto-mining document is a final decree establishing a framework for mining in Uzbekistan. The local government has issued multiple similar documents in recent years, repeatedly prohibiting individual miners from operating in Uzbekistan. One such decree was signed by Uzbekistan\u2019s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in April 2022, reiterating that local people cannot pay with crypto or mine digital currencies.\n\nThe NAPP did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comment.\n\nMagazine: Web3 Gamer: Minecraft bans Bitcoin P2E, iPhone 15 & crypto gaming, Formula E"

        "content": "A Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETF is looking very likely, with the world's leading crypto asset manager, Grayscale, as a possible front-runner to be approved by the SEC. In the meantime, Grayscale is lengthening its lead by applying to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) to a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nGrayscale will be speaking at Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 14 in NYC.\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust represents 2.5% of all ETH in circulation and is the largest ETH investment vehicle in the world. Grayscale stated that the ETHE trust has always been on the path to becoming an ETF. Currently, the Ethereum underlying the trust is discounted at 30%, but the ETH would be worth $5.14 billion at full market value.\n\nShares of ETHE spiked 6.15% in value following the announcement of the spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nTim Draper, a prominent investor and entrepreneur known for successful investments in companies such as Tesla, Skype, and Coinbase, gave Benzinga exclusive comments on the Grayscale spot BTC ETF application. To Draper, approval seems to be a matter of time: \"I am surprised it has taken so long. I'm not sure why the SEC approved futures and not spot trading. It seems capricious,\" Draper said.\n\nHe expects the availability of a spot Bitcoin ETF to encourage more adoption and investments in BTC.\n\n\"It will allow more people to participate in this new global, open, transparent, frictionless economy provided by Bitcoin and its blockchain. It will bring more light on the unbanked who can use Bitcoin to participate in the global economy,\" Draper said.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin's 'Fake Pump Seems Over:' Crypto Analyst Capo Predicts Price Drop To $12K\n\nOne month ago, Circuit Judge Neomi Rao wrote a DC Circuit Court of Appeals opinion that favored Grayscale's application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a more accessible Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Rao's opinion said, in part, \"The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two Bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale's proposed Bitcoin ETP. In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale's petition for review and vacate the Commission's order.\"\n\nOther applicants for a spot BTC ETF include ARK Investment, BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity/Wise Origin, GlobalX, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck, and WisdomTree.\n\nInvestor, author, and Forbes contributor Clem Chambers said: \"It seems unlikely that there will be much of a gap between applicants if a BTC ETF is cleared\u2026 To me it's anyone's guess when it will be approved, but if the SEC had its way there will be no ETF unless they think it will be a negative for Bitcoin and crypto.\"\n\nThe legal victory in DC compels the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revisit the Grayscale application for a spot BTC ETF after rejecting it.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart welcomed the news by raising the odds of the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF to 75% by the end of 2023 and 95% by the end of 2024.\n\nFind out more about Bitcoin and its history.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price bullish action toward $28,000 on Oct. 1 was partially fueled by the uncertainty regarding the United States debt limit. However, United States President Joe Biden signed the spending bill just hours before the Sept. 30 deadline, avoiding a government shutdown.\n\nInvestors now question whether the momentum remains favorable for cryptocurrencies, given that the worst-case political-economic scenario is no longer on the table. However, it is worth noting that this bill merely provides extra funding for the next 45 days, giving more time for the House and Senate to work on their funding plans for 2024.\n\nAt first glance, it might be tempting for investors to use futures contracts to go long on Bitcoin. However, there\u2019s a significant risk of getting liquidated if the price suddenly drops, and it\u2019s impossible to predict whether a successful budget discussion down the road will benefit cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith the current extension in place, lawmakers now need to find a solution before Nov. 17. According to Margaret Spellings, president and CEO of the Bipartisan Policy Center:\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t continue postponing our fiscal health and negotiating on the brink of government shutdowns and debt defaults.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that, despite narrowly avoiding a crisis, the overall risk of an economic recession remains. The U.S. Federal Reserve is grappling with persistent inflation and rising energy prices, factors that have driven the S&P 500 to its lowest point in 110 days and pushed the 10-year Treasury yield to levels not seen since October 2007.\n\nAdditionally, oil prices have surged to $90, marking a 27.5% gain in just three months. This upward pressure on inflation is expected to further constrain economic activity.\n\nOn Sept. 27, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari expressed uncertainty about whether interest rates have been raised sufficiently to combat this price growth.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s initial reaction does not guarantee bullish momentum\n\nAmid all this turmoil, Bitcoin has increased in value, breaking through the $28,000 resistance on Oct. 2. This performance prompted investors to anticipate heightened volatility for the cryptocurrency as the upcoming debt ceiling decision approaches.\n\nProfessional traders will avoid directional risk, given the uncertain outcome of the political debate, and opt for the reverse (short) iron butterfly, a limited-risk, limited-profit trading strategy.\n\nProfit/loss estimate. Source: Deribit Position Builder\n\nThe prices mentioned were accurate as of Oct. 2, with Bitcoin trading at $28,326. All options listed expire on Oct. 27, but this strategy can also be adapted for different time frames. It\u2019s essential to remember that options have a set expiry date, meaning that the price increase must occur during the defined period.\n\nThe recommended neutral-market strategy involves selling 5.4 contracts of $26,000 put options while simultaneously selling 5.4 call options with a $30,000 strike. To complete the trade, one should buy 5.8 contracts of $28,000 call options and an additional five contracts of $28,000 put options.\n\nWhile a call option grants the buyer the right to acquire an asset, the contract seller assumes a potential negative exposure. To fully shield against market fluctuations, an investor must deposit 0.253 BTC (approximately $7,170), representing the maximum potential loss.\n\nConviction in volatility is essential, as the risk-reward is reversed\n\nFor this investor to profit, Bitcoin\u2019s price must be below $26,630 on Oct. 27 (a decrease of 6%) or above $29,280 (an increase of 3.4%). In essence, the trade offers a potentially substantial profit zone, but losses are 90% higher than potential gains if Bitcoin remains stagnant.\n\nThe maximum payout is 0.133 BTC (roughly $3,770). However, if a trader believes that volatility is imminent, a 6% movement within 24 days appears achievable.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that investors have the option to reverse the operation before the options expire, preferably after a substantial Bitcoin price movement. To do this, they should repurchase the two options they had initially sold and sell the two options they had originally bought.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

However, this phase was followed by a significant correction that caused prices to plummet, sending the cryptocurrency back to lower levels,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWedson also suggested that should history repeat, sub-$20,000 levels could resurface. An accompanying chart offered a fractal, which could now be subject to a repeat.\n\n\u201cNow, in 2023, we are once again witnessing Bitcoin achieving over +100% in gains, attracting substantial interest from institutional and retail investors. Nevertheless, the market has recently experienced significant volatility and a downward price trend. This similarity to the past raises questions about whether we are witnessing a repeat of the previous cycle,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cThe target is $19,500 USD if this fractal holds over the next few weeks, which could result in a series of FUD and negative news in the cryptocurrency space. Furthermore, there is the possibility of a redistribution, where the price threatens significant highs, but institutional profit-taking forces the price down, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty in the market.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart with fractal (screenshot).

        "title": "What are the EU's white paper requirements in MiCAR and do they apply to Bitcoin? - Osborne Clarke",
        "content": "The ground-breaking Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation will apply across the EU, but what will its impact be on established crypto-assets?\n\nAfter intensive discussions and compromises, the first comprehensive crypto regulation is here: the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation \u2013 MiCAR. MiCAR will regulate crypto-assets themselves, and also the services and products connected to them, in a harmonised way across the EU. In this article we focus on the new white paper obligation and how it will be applied to established crypto-assets like Bitcoin.\n\nThe development of MiCAR\n\nMiCAR is the European Parliament\u2019s response to citizens\u2019 expectations to set safeguards and standards for the use of blockchain technology, which was expressed in Proposal 35(8) of the conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe.\n\nThe European Commission first presented MiCAR as a proposal on 24 September 2020 as part of the larger digital finance package, which aims to develop a harmonised European approach that ensures financial stability and consumer protection, while also fostering technological developments and innovation.\n\nPrior to MiCAR there were worries that the current legal framework could pose obstacles to the use of new digital financial instruments, and doubts as to whether certain new financial products and technologies would fall within the scope of active financial regulation in the EU. The new package addresses those concerns by ensuring that the current legal framework does not pose obstacles and that the new products and technologies will fall within the scope of financial regulation and risk management arrangements. The harmonised nature of the regulatory framework also adapts the regulation to the global nature of crypto markets and improves the current situation with national legislation in some Member States.\n\nOn 20 April 2023 the European Parliament officially endorsed MiCAR with 529 votes in favour (29 against). The legislative process concluded in the formal adoption of the regulation on 16 May 2023.\n\nMiCAR was officially published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 9 June 2023 as Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 2023 on markets in crypto-assets, and amending Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010 and Directives 2013/36/EU and (EU) 2019/1937 (Volume 66, 9 June 2023, L 150, pages 40-205).\n\nOn 30 June 2024, two months after its publication, Titles III and IV, the regulations regarding asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens, shall apply. The other MiCAR provisions will apply 18 months after publication, on 30 December 30 2024.\n\nThe European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a first consultation paper about Technical Standards specifying certain requirements of the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation on 12 July 2023. The aim of its paper is to collect views, comments and opinions from stakeholders and market participants on the appropriate implementation of MiCAR. It intends to publish further consultation packages in October 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\n\nScope of MiCAR\n\nCrypto-assets in general are defined in MiCAR as a digital representation of a value or a right that is able to be transferred and stored electronically using distributed ledger technology (DLT) or similar technology (such as currency-tokens like Bitcoin or utility-tokens) (Article 3, paragraph 1 (5)).\n\nMiCAR generally is separated into titles concerning asset-referenced tokens (Title III), e-money tokens (Title IV) and crypto-assets other than asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens (Title II), as well as titles for definitions (Title I), conditions for crypto-asset service providers (Title V) and the prohibition of market abuse (Title VI).\n\nAsset-referenced tokens are a type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing another value or right or a combination thereof, including one or more official currencies, without being an electronic money token (e-money-token) (Article 3 paragraph 1 (6) MiCAR.) These tokens are usually referred to as stablecoins, for example, Tether or USDC, which reference the US dollar.\n\nElectronic money tokens or e-money tokens are a type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referencing the value of one official currency, see Article 3 paragraph 1 No. 7 MiCAR. The value of e-money tokens is backed by one fiat currency (e.g. Euro, US-Dollar).\n\nThe third category of crypto assets are the types of crypto-assets that do not fall into the category of asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens (see Title II).\n\nObligation to provide a crypto-asset white paper\n\nOne of the most important new provisions within MiCAR is the requirement for drawing up, notifying and publishing a crypto-asset white paper for asset-referenced tokens, e-money tokens and other crypto-assets.\n\nA crypto-asset white paper is an information document containing mandatory disclosures. It should contain general information on the issuer, offeror or person seeking admission to trading, on the project to be carried out with the capital raised, on the offer to the public of crypto-assets or on their admission to trading, on the rights and obligations attached to the crypto-assets, on the underlying technology used for such crypto-assets and on the related risks (see recital 24 MiCAR).\n\nIt is generally mandatory to draw up, notify and publish a crypto-asset white paper before offering crypto-assets to the public or seeking admission to trading of a crypto-asset.\n\nBaFin (the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) describes a white paper as a summary of the most important information about the offeror and the crypto-asset that is easy for everyone to understand.\n\nObligation for crypto-assets other than asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens\n\nIn general, as determined in Article 4 paragraph 1 MiCAR, a person shall not make an offer to the public of a crypto-asset (other than asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens) unless that person is a legal person and has drawn up, notified and published a crypto-asset white paper in accordance with Articles 6, 8 and 9 MiCAR.\n\nThe white paper requirements do not apply to an offer of crypto-assets: to fewer than 150 persons per Member State, or if the offer does not exceed \u20ac1 million over a period of 12 months starting with the beginning of the offer, or it is solely to qualified investors where the crypto-assets can only be held by such qualified investors (Article 4 paragraph 2 MiCAR).\n\nThe requirement for a white paper also does not apply, if the crypto-asset is offered for free (for example, airdrop) or as a reward for the maintenance of the DLT or validation of transactions (such as mining or staking) (Article 4 paragraph 3 MiCAR).\n\nThe offering of utility tokens providing access to a good or service that already exists or is in operation (serves as a voucher) is exempt from the white paper requirement (and all of Title II), according to Article 4 section 3 (c). The same goes for the offer of a crypto-asset if the holder of the crypto-asset has the right to use it only in exchange for goods and services in a limited network of merchants with contractual arrangements with the offeror (Article 4 section 3 (d)).\n\nThe rules for seeking admission to trading of crypto-assets are similar. Article 5 paragraph 1 MiCAR provides that a person shall not seek admission to trading of a crypto-asset if that person is not a legal person and has drawn up, notified and published a crypto-asset white paper in accordance with Articles 6, 8 and 9 MiCAR.\n\nThe requirement of a white paper does not apply to a crypto-asset that is already admitted to trading on another trading platform for crypto-assets in the EU and if the crypto-asset white paper is drawn up in accordance with Article 6, updated in accordance with Article 12, and the person responsible for drawing up such white paper consents to its use in writing (according to Article 5 paragraph 4 MiCAR).\n\nObligation for asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens\n\nThe white paper requirements for asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens are more stringent compared to the requirements for other crypto-assets.\n\nAny offer to the public or admission to trading for asset-referenced tokens requires a white paper (Article 16 paragraph 1, Article 19 and Article 21 paragraph 1 MiCAR). Even in cases where the issuer does not require an authorisation to offer the tokens to the public or seek its admission to trading (total value limited to \u20ac5,000,000 or offer limited to qualified investors), a white paper is required, according to Article 16 paragraph 2 and Recital (43) MiCAR.\n\nAny offer to the public or admission to trading of e-money tokens requires a white paper, according to Article 48 paragraph 1 (b) and Article 51 MiCAR. Even in cases where the issuer of e-money tokens is exempt from an authorisation to offer the tokens to the public or seek its admission to trading under the applicable electronic money framework (for example, limited networks), a white paper (and also the notification to the authority) to inform buyers about the characteristics and risk of the asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens is required (Article 48 paragraph 7 and recital (66) MiCAR).\n\nContent requirements for a crypto-asset white paper\n\nThe form and content of the white paper are also specified in MiCAR.\n\nCrypto-assets other than asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens\n\nThe content requirements for white papers of crypto-assets (other than asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens) are detailed in Articles 5-8 MiCAR and their respective parts in Annex I.\n\nThe content and structure of a crypto-asset white paper is comparable to a securities prospectus under the European Securities Prospectus Regulation.\n\nThe white paper should start with the following statement \u201cThis crypto-asset white paper has not been approved by any competent authority in any Member State of the European Union. The [offeror][person seeking admission to trading][operator of the trading platform] of the crypto-asset is solely responsible for the content of this crypto-asset white paper.\u201d (Article 6, paragraph 3 MiCAR.)\n\nThis shall be followed by a statement from the management body of the offeror, the person seeking admission to trading or the operator of the trading platform confirming compliance with MiCAR and that the presented information is fair, clear and not misleading (Article 6, paragraph 6).\n\nAfter this statement, the white paper shall contain a summary which provides key information about the offer to the public of the crypto-asset or the intended admission to trading in brief and non-technical language, as well as a warning detailed in Article 6, paragraph 7 MiCAR.\n\nThe white paper shall be drawn up in an official language of the home Member State or in a language customary in the sphere of international finance (notably English) and should contain the date of its notification and a table of contents (Article 6, paragraph 8 (f)).\n\nIn addition to that, the white paper should provide information about the offeror or the person seeking admission to trading as well as the issuer, if different, and, in cases where it draws up the crypto-asset white paper, about the operator of the trading platform. This information includes the name, the legal form, the registered address, the date of registration, the legal entity identifier and a contact telephone number and email address, identity, business addresses and functions of persons that are members of the management body and business or professional activity of the offeror or the person seeking admission to trading as well as their financial condition over the past three years (Article 6, paragraph 1a, b, c, Annex I part A, B, C).\n\nFurther requirements include information about the crypto-asset project (such as name and brief description and past and future milestones of the project, details of all natural and legal persons), the crypto-asset itself (the type of crypto-asset and a description of its characteristics) and the underlying technology (including DLT, protocols and technical standards used) as well as the rights and obligations attached to the crypto-asset (that is, information on future offers to the public of crypto-assets and a description of the conditions under which the rights and obligations may be modified) (Article 6, paragraph 1 d, f, g, h, Annex I part D, F, G, H).\n\nThe white paper should also contain information about the offer to the public of the crypto-asset or its admission to trading (like reasons for the offer to the public, the amount that the offer intends to raise in funds, the issue price and the total number of crypto-assets), information on the risks (including a description of the risks associated with the offer, the issuer, crypto-assets and the technology used) and the principal adverse impacts on the climate (and other environment-related adverse impacts of the consensus mechanism used to issue the crypto-asset) (Article 6 paragraph 1 e, i, j, Annex I part E, I). The latter information requirement is a consequence of discussions about the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe provided information should be fair, clear and not misleading and presented in a concise and comprehensible form. The white paper should not contain material omissions, or any assertions as regards the future value of the crypto-assets (Article 6 paragraph 2, 4).\n\nMoreover, the white paper shall contain a clear and unambiguous statement, detailed in Article 6 paragraph 5 MiCAR, including a warning to the potential loss of value and, transferability and liquidity.\n\nAfter the white paper is drawn up, it must then be notified and published in accordance with Articles 8 and 9 MiCAR.\n\nAsset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens\n\nWhite papers for asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens have similar content requirements to papers for other crypto-assets.\n\nThe requirements for e-money token white papers, contained in Article 51 and Annex III MiCAR, are almost identical to those listed in Article 6 MiCAR for crypto-assets that are neither e-money tokens nor asset-referenced tokens. However, they need to contain specific information adapted to e-money tokens.\n\nThe white paper requirements for asset-referenced tokens are similar, but also require information on the reserve of assets (see Article 19 and Annex II MiCAR).\n\nApplication to established crypto currencies\n\nThe white paper requirement is easy to imagine for crypto-assets that will be issued and offered by a legal person when MiCAR will be applicable. However, a very interesting question is how the rules for a mandatory white paper will apply to Bitcoin and other crypto currencies that were already issued and traded on various platforms before MiCAR applies?\n\nBitcoin is considered a crypto-asset, pursuant to MiCAR, that is neither an asset-referenced token nor an e-money token. It therefore falls under the regulations under Title II MiCAR. According to Article 4 paragraph 1 (b)-(d) MiCAR, a person shall not make an \u201coffer to the public of a crypto-asset\u201d unless that person has drawn up, notified and published a crypto-asset white paper. The white paper obligation refers to the term \u201coffer to the public\u201d \u2013 a term also familiar from the securities prospectus regulation.\n\nAn \u201coffer to the public\u201d according to MiCAR means \u201ca communication to persons in any form, and by any means, presenting sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the crypto-assets to be offered so as to enable prospective holders to decide whether to purchase those crypto-assets\u201d (Article 3, paragraph 1 (12) MiCAR). The \u201cissuer\u201d or the \u201cofferor\u201d of crypto-assets is responsible for this public offer.\n\nFor Bitcoin, there is no issuer of the crypto-assets, but a trading platform could be deemed as an \u201cofferor\u201d. According to MiCAR an offeror is \u201ca natural or legal person, [\u2026] who offers crypto-assets to the public\u201d.\n\nAs the term \u201cofferor\u201d is also related to the securities prospectus regulation, it seems reasonable to have a look at existing interpretations of the term. Pursuant to Art. 2 (j) of the EU Securities Regulation, the offeror is any legal entity or natural person who offers securities to the public and thus not necessarily the issuer. Offerors are also those who \u2013 in so-called distribution chains \u2013 resell securities. An offeror is anyone who is \"responsible for the public offering of the investment\" or at least shares responsibility and appears \"to the investors as an offeror that is recognisable from the outside\". However, mere sales assistants are not considered offerors (Assmann/Schlitt/von Kopp-Colomb, Prospektrecht Kommentar, \u00a7 9 WpPG Haftung bei fehlerhaftem B\u00f6rsenzulassungsprospekt, No. 81-83).\n\nA crypto trading platform \u2013 even if it offers proprietary trading with crypto assets \u2013 appears to the customers as a seller, but not as a responsible entity for the crypto assets itself (like Bitcoin). Typically, an offeror has an influence on the product and therefore a specific responsibly. A crypto trading platform has no influence or responsibly for the listed crypto currencies like Bitcoin and is therefore not deemed as an \u201cofferor\u201d. Listing crypto assets on a trading platform would not qualify as an offer to the public. This means there are no crypto-asset white paper obligations for a crypto trading platform under Article 4, paragraph 1 (b)-(d) MiCAR.\n\nIf a person seeks admission to trade crypto-assets, Article 5 paragraph 1 (b)-(d) MiCAR would generally require them to draw up, notify and publish a white paper. Contrary to what a first read of the Articles may suggest, the requirement for a white paper does not extend to all platforms that offer crypto trading, but only to multilateral trading platforms. The reason is that under MiCAR any admission to trading refers to an admission on a trading platform for crypto-assets within the meaning of Article 3, paragraph 1 (18) MiCAR. This provision refers to multilateral trading platforms bringing together multiple purchasing and selling interests in a pre-defined automated system.\n\nMost platforms that offer crypto trading do not provide a multilateral trading system but legally and technically operate as brokerage and/or proprietary trading services. Such platforms are therefore not multilateral \u201ctrading platforms for crypto-assets\u201d under MiCAR. As a consequence, the provisions containing white paper obligations in the case of an admission to trading do not apply for such trading platforms.\n\nHowever, in case the already-issued crypto-asset is to be traded on a multilateral trading platform for crypto-assets under MiCAR, a white paper is still required. In such cases MiCAR also offers the possibility of white paper reliance, under Article 5, paragraph 4. This requires that the crypto-asset is already admitted to trading on another (multilateral) trading platform for crypto-assets. Additionally, the white paper needs to have been drawn up in accordance with Article 6 and updated in accordance with Article 12, and the person responsible for drawing up the white paper needs to have consented to its use in writing."

        "content": "Unchained, a leading bitcoin financial services provider, has expanded its collaborative custody network with the addition of Coincover, a company known for protecting and insuring over 5 million crypto wallets, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. This move aims to bolster the security of Unchained's collaborative custody product, which now secures over $2 billion in Bitcoin, representing a 37% year-over-year increase since October 2022.\n\nUnchained, known for its multisignature collaborative custody, caters to institutional investors, corporate treasuries, governments, and retail customers. This approach leverages the decentralized capabilities of the Bitcoin network, requiring a minimum of two private keys to access an account's Bitcoin holdings. This security measure is designed to mitigate the risks associated with single points of failure, a concern underscored by recent incidents involving custodians like Prime Trust and Fortress Trust, lenders such as BlockFi and Celsius, and exchanges like FTX.\n\n\u201cWhen considering a custody solution, we believe clients should ask themselves two fundamental questions: 1) What happens to your bitcoin if their company disappears, and 2) Can they move or access your assets without your knowledge and consent,\u201d said Joe Kelly, co-founder and CEO of Unchained. \u201cWe believe that the current solutions fall short of a great answer to both these questions, and are excited to move the industry forward with more robust delegated custody solutions.\u201d\n\nThe addition of Coincover to Unchained's network strengthens custody by further decentralizing keys, ensuring investors maintain full control over their Bitcoin holdings, rendering them immune to exchange hacks and collapses. With Coincover and Kingdom Trust as custodial partners, Unchained aims to protect clients' Bitcoin against issues like rehypothecation or single points of failure, such as hacks or firm bankruptcies.\n\nDhruv Bansal, co-founder and CSO of Unchained, stated, \u201cIn a world where bitcoin is worth $1,000,000 per coin, will the largest bitcoin stakeholders continue to singularly trust any one single custodian?\u201d\n\nUnchained says it plans to continue expanding its collaborative custody network by partnering with additional firms while also offering options where clients maintain control of their private keys.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFormer BlackRock managing director Steven Schoenfield, who\u2019s now the CEO of MarketVector Indexes, gives the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \u201cthree to six months\u201d before it approves a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nSchoenfield gave his estimate during a panel discussion on ETFs at CCData\u2019s Digital Asset Summit in London yesterday, where he was joined by another ex-BlackRock director Martin Bednall, now CEO of Jacobi Asset Management.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSchoenfield was responding to comments made earlier by Bednall that \u201cthe SEC will probably approve [all ETF applications] at the same time; I don\u2019t think they want to give anybody first mover advantage.\u201d\n\nPreviously the MarketVector CEO said he would have given the industry \u201cnine to twelve months\u201d before an approval, but the SEC\u2019s recent decision to delay giving verdicts on several pending ETF applications is unlike previous delaying tactics by the regulator.\n\n\u201cInstead of completely rejecting the whole list, they've asked for comments, which is a marginal but significant improvement in the dialogue,\u201d says Shoenfield. \u201cThere's also the Grayscale lawsuit, which the SEC lost, which means they're most likely going to have to allow the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to be converted into an ETF.\u201d\n\nBlackrock, crypto and the Bitcoin ETF\n\nThrough its pending ETF application, traditional finance\u2019s top asset manager, BlackRock\u2014shepherding $9.42 trillion in assets-under-management (AUM)\u2014seems the likeliest contender to get a Bitcoin spot ETF approved.\n\nAfter all, it has a winning score of 575-1 when it comes to getting ETFs through the SEC.\n\nNobody would have seen it coming back in 2017 when BlackRock chief Larry Fink called Bitcoin an \u201cindex of money laundering.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFast forward to summer 2023: Fink appeared on FOX News and said that crypto \u201cis digitizing gold in many ways.\u201d\n\nDuring CCData\u2019s panel discussion in London yesterday, Martin Bednall said he believes in any case that the traditional financial muscle, in terms of both brand and resources, will give BlackRock a first-mover advantage should the SEC decide to start approving Bitcoin spot ETFs.\n\nShoenfield was more temperate in his views about their former company\u2019s foray into crypto.\n\n\u201cI disagree with my former colleague Martin. As much as Blackrock will try to crush the competition, there's a good half dozen, maybe eight or nine, other firms deeply committed to tradable digital assets,\" he said. \"They've all got applications in and some are actually much closer to the crypto ecosystem than than BlackRock. So I think Blackrock will be in for quite a fight.\u201d\n\nHe later added that his company has run the numbers and believes spot ETF approval may result in a \u201c$150 to $200 billion inflow\u201d into Bitcoin investment products over three years, which would \u201cdouble or triple the amount of AUM in current Bitcoin products.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) flipping full bull could come courtesy of the United States government, a new prediction says.\n\nIn an X thread on Oct. 4, Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, eyed ballooning yields as a precursor to a new Bitcoin and crypto bull market.\n\nHayes: Bitcoin bulls should eye U.S. \u201cno way out\u201d moment\n\nU.S. Treasury yields are \u201cscreaming higher,\u201d and with that, Hayes believes that a macroeconomic flashpoint is only a matter of time.\n\nThe reason comes in the form of a so-called \u201cbear steepener,\u201d a phenomenon that describes long-term interest rates rising more quickly than short-term ones.\n\n\u201cWhy do I love these markets right now when yields are screaming higher? Bank models have no concept of a bear steepener occurring,\u201d he argued.\n\nGiven the current steep rise in the 2s30s curve \u2014 the difference between the 30-year and two-year yields \u2014 combined with rising long- and short-term interest rates, the pressure across the economy is rising.\n\n\u201cDue to the leverage and non-linear risks embedded in banks\u2019 portfolios, they will be selling bonds or paying fixed on IRS as rates rise. More selling, begets more selling, which is no bueno for bond prices,\u201d Hayes continued.\n\nThe result should be clear \u2014 a return to mass liquidity injections, counteracting the quantitative tightening seen since late 2021, which has pressured crypto markets.\n\nFor Hayes, this cannot come without major casualties along the way. He concluded:\n\n\u201cThe faster this bear steepener rises, the faster someone goes belly up, the faster everyone recognises there is no way out other than money printing to save govt bond markets, the faster we get back to the crypto bull market :).

Earlier in the previous week\u2019s cycle, fears over a funding bill stalemate led to predictions that the U.S. government would shut down on Oct. 2.\n\nHowever, a last-minute effort by Senate leaders allowed for the passage of a stopgap that ensures funding through Nov. 17. Whether Congress and the president can come to terms to fund the government beyond the current measure\u2019s expiration remains to be seen.\n\nGeographically, Germany, Canada and Switzerland led the charge for the week, with digital asset investment product inflows amounting to $17.7 million, $17.2 million and $7.4 million, respectively. Australia and France held the line, metaphorically speaking, with $100,000 for the former and zero for the latter.\n\nThe United States, however, registered $18.5 million in outflows, with Sweden and Brazil following suit at $1.8 million and $900,000 outgoing, respectively."

        "content": "Why bitcoin is inspiring a digital Swiss franc makeover\n\nMoves are afoot to create new digital versions of the Swiss franc to run alongside physical cash. \u00a9 Keystone / Gaetan Bally\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies has inspired central banks and private enterprise to redesign money, including the Swiss franc, by clothing it in the latest digital technology.\n\n7 minutes\n\nSwitzerland is well placed to take a leading role, having established a network of cryptocurrency companies, collectively known as \u201cCrypto Valley\u201d, which interact with the traditional financial sector.\n\nSwiss bankers are enthused by way digital blockchain Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) could automate time-consuming tasks, such as processing transactions, and open new avenues of business.\n\n\u201cBlockchain is going to fundamentally change our business, everyone is looking into it,\u201d Gr\u00e9goire Bordier, president of the Association of Swiss Private Banks, told SWI swissinfo.ch.\n\n\u201cA fundamental competitive pillar of the financial industry is IT. One of the reasons that Switzerland welcomed the creation of Crypto Valley was to remain in the game during the constant evolution of IT innovation.\u201d\n\nDifferent designs\n\nThe goal is to speed up financial transactions, reduce fees and automate different parts of the financial chain. But what does this mean for banks, traders and the person on the street? It ultimately depends on the exact design of the new digital money.\n\nThe creators of bitcoin invented blockchain to give users total control over their money and the freedom to spend it without needing a bank \u2013 much like handing someone physical cash, but in the digital world.\n\nA separate breed of cryptocurrency, called stablecoins, seeks to curb wild price swings by pegging to traditional currencies or other assets to stabilise their value (see animation).\n\nMore\n\nMore Stablecoins explained This content was published on Traditional cryptocurrencies can rapidly change in value. A new form of cryptocurrency backed by traditional money promises more stability. Read more: Stablecoins explained\n\nNo state-backed digital franc yet\n\nGovernments and central banks fear losing control of money to this new breed of private digital cash. Many countries have adapted financial regulations to prevent bitcoin users from sidestepping controls on money laundering and fraud.\n\nBut the traditional financial world also spies an opportunity to leverage DLT to retain their edge. Cryptocurrencies have opened a Pandora\u2019s box of experimentation with money.\n\nIn answer to bitcoin, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) is one of dozens of central banks currently testing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), a type of cryptocurrency controlled and backed by the state.\n\nMore\n\nMore Explained: The technology behind bitcoin and blockchain This content was published on To some, it\u2019s a load of hot air. Others see a revolutionary technology that will transform the way we exchange nearly everything of value. Read more: Explained: The technology behind bitcoin and blockchain\n\nA recent survey of 86 central banks by the Bank for International Settlements found that 93% are engaged in CBDC experiments. Many have ramped up activities in response to increasing public enthusiasm for bitcoin and the emergence of other private digital currencies, such as the now-defunct Libra/Diem project from Facebook that once took root in Geneva.\n\nThe potential use-cases for digital money are varied: replacing physical cash, tracing criminal financial flows more effectively or enabling people in countries with weak banking systems to manage their finances on smartphones.\n\nDLT can also give people greater access and choice for loans and financial trading, says Thomas Eichenberger, Chief Product Officer at Sygnum bank, which specialises in digital assets. \u201cA better user experience and cost efficiencies would be the natural consequence of intermediary-free finance,\u201d he told SWI swissinfo.ch.\n\nBut while the intention looks benign on paper, the very thought of central banks replacing bank notes with new versions of digital money has raised alarm bells worldwide.\n\nAttack on cash?\n\nIn Switzerland, the Swiss Libertarian Movement has launched a popular initiative, dubbed \u201cCash is Freedom\u201d, that demands constitutional protection for physical cash.\n\nThe Swiss Libertarian Movement fears that digital money could be abused to monitor people\u2019s payments, erasing the anonymity offered by physical cash.\n\nExternal Content\n\nPatrick Schueffel, a professor at the Institute of Finance of Fribourg\u2019s School of Management, believes CBDCs could be employed for far more sinister purposes, particularly by autocratic states. In the worst case, they \u201cpose a threat to liberal democracies\u201d, he told SWI swissinfo.ch.\n\nThe new technology could be leveraged to monitor payments, block \u201csocially unacceptable\u201d transactions, such as those that harm the environment, or simply freeze \u201cundesirable\u201d people out of the financial system, he warns.\n\n\u201cThis is dangerous even in a country like Switzerland,\u201d Schueffel said. \u201cIf the authorities have this power at their disposal, they could be tempted to use it.\u201d\n\nThe Swiss Data Protection Commissioner\u2019s office has noted intrusive surveillance concerns. \u201cWhen it comes to the creation of digital currencies, the primary principle to be observed is privacy by design and by default, which requests that projects take privacy interests into account at the very start to develop a concept that is in compliance with data protection principles as standard,\u201d it said in an emailed statement.\n\nAt present, however, the SNB sees no sense in producing a digital franc for high-street shoppers as this would step on the toes of commercial banking activity. The SNB is instead working with banks and the stock exchange to produce a so-called wholesale CBDC to speed up payments in financial trading.\n\nThis would work hand-in-hand with digitised versions of securities, like company shares, which can change hands at lightning speed, 24/7, rather than the current delay of several days. The holy grail is an \u201catomic swap\u201d: the instantaneous exchange of security and money.\n\nThis leaves a void for a digital currency intended for general retail use. Commercial ventures are intent on filling the gap with stablecoins backed by Swiss francs deposited at banks.\n\nCurrency competition\n\nThe Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) in June announced the intention of commercial banks to issue a retail stablecoin using DLT, which would \u201cpotentially allow for a wide range of new applications, reduce risks, increase efficiency, and open up whole new areas of business\u201d.\n\nThe SBA argues that the input of the traditional financial sector remains essential to ensure stability, consumer safety and to avoid scandals, such as the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, that have plagued the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nThe digital makeover of money has also created competition between countries to be the first to design a more efficient next generation of national currency.\n\nSwiss Stablecoin, a private enterprise that is designing its own digital franc, worries that waiting for other countries to digitise their currencies first could reduce future global demand for the Swiss franc. \u201cIt would be fatal to leave this field to foreign providers,\u201d Swiss Stablecoin founder and former parliamentarian Pascale Bruderer wrote in an opinion piece she co-authored for the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung newspaper."

        "title": "Mixing Bitcoin With 60/40 is Like Using Kerosene as Kindling - Morningstar.ca",
        "content": "Bitcoin has performed surprisingly well for the year to date. The CMBI Bitcoin Index posted a 76.4% return through July 2023 in defiance of the gloomy narratives that haunt the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nThe trusty \"balanced\" portfolio has also beaten expectations as of late. Vanguard Balanced Index [VBAIX] has turned in a respectable 12.8% for the year to date after a lousy 2022 that augured the age-old question of whether the 60/40 fund might be dead. Balanced funds\u2019 performance owes a great deal to the excellent performance of US stocks, which have returned a hearty 20.6%, as measured by the Morningstar US Market Index.\n\nSo far in 2023, risk has paid handsomely. That fact may leave investors wondering whether to add some extra firepower to their portfolio in the form of an allocation to bitcoin.\n\nWe say think very carefully before you do that.\n\nCompared with other assets, bitcoin's volatility is more kerosene than kindling. Over the 10-year period ended July 2023, bitcoin was 16.8 times as volatile as Vanguard Balanced Index. (The only asset that comes anywhere close is oil, although the price history of the Dow Jones Crude Oil Index only goes back to 2015.)\n\nRolling One-Year Volatility of Bitcoin Exceeds Other Assets\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023\n\nEven though bitcoin has performed favorably since the last time we examined bitcoin's impact on the 60/40 in 2021, its returns are still nearly four times as volatile as those of a balanced fund. That means that even a smidge of bitcoin changes the behaviour of an investor\u2019s portfolio a whole lot.\n\nHow Much is a Lot?\n\nLet's say in August 2013 a hypothetical investor added a 2% allocation to bitcoin to a costless 60/40 portfolio \u2013 that\u2019s $20 in bitcoin for every $1,000 invested.\n\n(For the purposes of this example, let's also assume the investor furnished that $20 investment from their bond portfolio, although it doesn't change the results much whether that money comes from stocks or bonds. We also rebalanced this portfolio on a monthly basis \u2013 that will become important in a second.)\n\nOur study found that a 2% sliver of bitcoin reshaped the return profile of their portfolio nearly as much as adding a 10% stake in stocks would have: a 60%/38%/2% split between stocks/bonds/bitcoin yielded a standard deviation of 10.7 over the past 10 years, in line with how a 70%/30% S&P 500/Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond portfolio would have behaved.\n\nBitcoin Alters Standard Deviations Far More Than Additional Stock Exposure\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nFurther up the risk spectrum, a portfolio with a 5% stake in bitcoin had a risk profile closer to a 90/10 portfolio than a 60/40. In fact, if that hypothetical portfolio was a fund, adding bitcoin would have easily pushed it out of the moderate allocation Morningstar Category to which most balanced funds belong.\n\nThe closest match among allocation categories is the aggressive allocation category, meaning that the portfolio leapfrogged the moderately aggressive allocation category altogether. (Meanwhile, any portfolio with a 10% allocation or more to bitcoin courted more risk than the S&P 500 on its own!)\n\nDecomposing that risk reveals even more. Effectively, a 1% allocation to bitcoin has a negligible effect on risk, either in terms of absolute volatility or relative contribution. But a 2% allocation to bitcoin explains close to 15% of a portfolio\u2019s overall volatility, a much heftier contribution. Meanwhile, a 5% allocation accounts for nearly 45% of the return volatility the portfolio experienced, and overall volatility was meaningfully higher.\n\nBitcoin's Relative Contribution to Risk Increases With Additional Exposure\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct\n\nAlthough adding bitcoin does open up the risk throttle on these hypothetical portfolios, it\u2019s worth pointing out investors would have been fairly compensated for doing so. A costless 60/40 portfolio would have turned in a Sharpe ratio (a return metric that accounts for risk) of roughly 0.77 over the past decade. Each portfolio that contains bitcoin improves upon that result, although incremental improvements peak at a 5% slice.\n\nBitcoin Has Compensated Investors for Additional Risk\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct.\n\nWith that said, our portfolios were crafted using a fairly narrow set of assumptions that aren't likely to hold in practice. Most digital assets are quarantined in a separate wallet or exchange account, which makes it tedious for investors to rebalance on a monthly cadence like we did in our study. Whether because of inertia or mental accounting or both, many investors opt not to rebalance at all.\n\nWhen it comes to security selection \u2013 picking individual stocks, for example \u2013 the \"do nothing\u201d approach may have some merit. But when it comes to asset allocation, there are consequences to portfolio neglect. For example, a 1% allocation to bitcoin (funded proportionally from stocks and bonds this time, to replicate the experience of segregating assets) can quickly spiral into a 60% allocation if investors fail to reap what they\u2019ve sown.\n\nFailing to Rebalance Has Significant Consequences for an Investor's Asset Allocation\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct\n\nEven one annual rebalance makes a world of difference. There are some edge cases, like 2013 and 2017, where the allocation to bitcoin would have climbed above 5%. But mostly it plods along somewhere between 1% and 2%. For only 15 months out of the entire 10-year holding period does the portfolio overtake that 2% threshold where the portfolio experiences volatility that\u2019s out of spec with the risk profile of a 60/40 portfolio.\n\nAnnual Rebalances Partially Succeed in Keeping Allocation to Bitcoin in Check\n\nSource: Morningstar Direct\n\nWe see a marginal benefit to existing owners of digital assets who would have an easier time trying to rebalance this high-octane holding if it's permitted to live alongside their traditional investments. But without the investor protections that other asset classes provide, we continue to advise that investors treat purchases of digital assets (including bitcoin) as a sunk cost rather than an investable asset.\n\nEven so, there are investors who fall somewhere in between these two extremes and treat bitcoin as something more than a sunk cost but less than a full-blown portfolio holding. I would say those investors should tread cautiously. Like caviar or dynamite, a little bit of bitcoin goes a long way.\n\nMost digital assets, including the cryptocurrencies mentioned in this article, are not currently classified as shares of registered securities and therefore do not fall under Morningstar\u2019s editorial policies.

(NASDAQ: RIOT) is a publicly traded Bitcoin mining company. It is one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world, with a hash rate of over 10.7 exahashes per second (EH/s) as of October 12, 2023. The company operates two mining facilities in North America, with a total capacity of over 400 megawatts.\n\nRiot Platforms Stock Performance in the Last 12 Months\n\nLast 5 Days -10.2% Last 1 Month -24.7% Last 6 Months +13.0% Last 12 Months +85.9%\n\nRIOT Platform stock has failed to ride on the Bitcoin price surge.

Crowd's Wisdom Neutral 2a. Social Media Buzz Steady 2b. Social Media Sentiment Steady\n\nThe stock price of RIOT faced resistance of just under $20 and has been consistently trending downwards since. Despite ongoing efforts, RIOT has struggled to establish a stable support level. The pivotal point appears to be $10, where potential buyers are anticipated to defend against further declines. However, a breach below this crucial support level could potentially unleash a significant wave of selling. RIOT has yet to capitalize on the current positive momentum in the Bitcoin market.\n\nUTC: Mar 14th, 2024 12:01 PM\n\n\n\n\n\nRiot Platforms Stock Price Prediction in the next 24 hours is between $11.5 and $12.1\n\nRiot Platforms Stock Price Prediction this week is between $11.1 and $12.7\n\nRIOT Platforms Price Target: Analysts\n\nRIOT Target Price $17.4 Cantor Fitzgerald $20 JP Morgan $6.5 HC Wainwright & Co. $20 Roth MKM $22.5 Needham $18\n\nRiot Platforms Stock Forecast 2024-2025-2030, Aggregated\n\nRiot Platforms Stock Price Prediction 2024 is $18.3\n\nRiot Platforms Stock Price Prediction 2025 is $23.1\n\nRiot Platforms Stock Price Prediction 2026 is $30.0\n\nRiot Platforms Stock Price Prediction 2027 is $45.6\n\nRiot Platforms Stock Price Prediction 2028 is $57.2\n\nRiot Platforms Stock Price Prediction 2029 is $71.6\n\nRiot Platforms Stock Price Prediction 2030 is $112\n\nRiot Platforms Stock Forecast 2024: Will RIOT reach $100 in 2024?\n\nIt is possible that RIOT stock could reach $100 in 2024. The stock has been on a tear in recent months, and it is expected to rise riding on the back of the surge in the Bitcoin price. However, there are a number of factors that could affect the stock\u2019s performance in the coming months, including the overall performance of the stock market, the price of Bitcoin, and the competitive landscape.\n\nOn the one hand, RIOT is a well-positioned company with a strong balance sheet and a healthy cash flow position. The company is also benefiting from the rising price of Bitcoin. In addition, RIOT is expanding its operations and investing in new technologies.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock market is currently volatile, and there is always the risk of a market downturn. RIOT stock is also exposed to the price of Bitcoin, which can be volatile. Finally, RIOT is facing increasing competition from other Bitcoin mining companies.\n\nOverall, it is possible that RIOT stock could reach $100 in 2024. However, investors should carefully consider the risks and rewards before making any investment decisions.\n\nSome Calculation\n\nFor the RIOT Platform to reach $100 from its current price, it will have to rise 8 times. At $100 the market cap of RIOT Platform stock will be $25.2 Billion.\n\nRIOT Platform Stock Forecast 2024: Quarterly Financial Results\n\nRIOT Platform reported its full-year 2023 Financial result on February 22, 2024. Here are the highlights of the Financial Result:\n\nFinancial Highlights:\n\nTotal Revenue: $280.7 million (2022: $259.2 million) Driven by higher Bitcoin production and increased Bitcoin prices.

Bitcoin Mining Revenue: $189.0 million (2022: $156.9 million) Increased values of Bitcoin mined, averaging $28,859 per Bitcoin.\n\nMore Bitcoin mined due to an increase in deployed miners. Data Center Hosting Revenue: $27.3 million (2022: $36.9 million) Decrease attributed to termination of certain hosting agreements. Engineering Revenue: $64.3 million (2022: $65.3 million)\n\nOperational Highlights:\n\nNet Loss: $49.5 million (2022: $509.6 million) Significant improvement from 2022, impacted by non-cash impairment charges.
