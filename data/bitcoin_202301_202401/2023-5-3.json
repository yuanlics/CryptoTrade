        "title": "Traders grow wary of 'unloved' bitcoin rally - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nCryptocurrency trading activity has dwindled even as bitcoin enjoys its longest winning streak in more than two years, in a sign that many investors are increasingly reluctant to buy into the rebound after a string of collapses and scandals in 2022.\n\nThe price of bitcoin, the most popular token, has risen 70 per cent this year, helping the market regain some momentum following the failure of companies like exchange FTX.\n\nInvestors have shrugged off lawsuits from US regulators against companies such as Binance, the industry\u2019s largest exchange, and the collapsed stablecoin operator Terraform Labs, as authorities have sought to clamp down on activity they see as illegal.\n\nHowever, the price of bitcoin has since been stuck in a rut for more than a month, trading in a narrow range around $28,000. That pause has been accompanied by thinning volumes, with small trades increasingly able to move market prices.\n\n\u201cWhile bitcoin\u2019s recent performance is great on the face of it, many in crypto are calling this year an unloved rally,\u201d said Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture, a crypto index provider.\n\n\u201cSentiment hasn\u2019t changed, and regulatory scrutiny is sidelining a lot of new money that might otherwise enter the space. Price movements don\u2019t mean much if the industry isn\u2019t making meaningful progress to regain trust and attract new investors,\u201d he added.\n\nA bruising 2022 has left investors nursing losses or funds trapped in limbo as failed cryptocurrency lenders and exchanges go through bankruptcy proceedings in the courts.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts also argued confidence has been renewed by the weakness in the global banking sector, and the vast outflow of deposits from banks such as the US\u2019s Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate, and Credit Suisse in Switzerland.\n\nDigital assets dashboard Click here for real-time data on crypto prices and insights\n\n\u201cThat rally we experienced after the banking crisis earlier this year seemed to be directly related to a flight for safety and self-custody of funds away from the dollar,\u201d said Edmond Goh, head of trading at crypto broker B2C2.\n\nBut that sentiment has been undermined by a host of signals coming from crypto markets. Analysts point out that the rally in cryptocurrency prices was already built on a thinly traded market.\n\nThe degree to which a market can absorb large orders without major changes to the price of bitcoin has declined since the start of the year, according to data provider CCData.\n\nIn January it would have required the purchase of more than 1,400 bitcoins, roughly equivalent to $23mn at the time, to move the price of the token by more than 1 per cent of its prevailing market value, CCData said.\n\nTowards the end of last month it would have taken only 462 bitcoins, worth about $13mn, to move market prices by 1 per cent, the lowest point of market depth for the bitcoin-tether trading pair since May 2022, when the industry plunged into crisis.\n\n\u201cPrices are recovering, but liquidity has yet to return. No exchange or market maker has yet to fill the space that FTX and [its sister trading arm] Alameda once encompassed,\u201d said Michael Safai, managing partner at crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital.\n\nInvestors who have bought into bitcoin in recent months are now holding on to their investments.\n\nGlassnode, a crypto data provider, said \u201cthere has been remarkably little expenditure\u201d by investors who bought bitcoin when it hit a two-year low after FTX\u2019s failure last November.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018FOMO\u2019 that drove a lot of first time institutional and retail investors last year is obviously not happening now, despite the fact the crypto markets have rallied significantly this year,\u201d said one crypto fund manager based in Dubai, referring to a fear of missing out.\n\nMoreover, there have been outflows of $72mn over the last two weeks in digital asset investments, ending a six-week run of consecutive inflows, according to CoinShares. The crypto investment group ascribed the trend to the likeliness of further interest rate increases by the US Federal Reserve.\n\nTraders are also worried that the heavy clouds that have overshadowed the industry for the past 12 months have not fully gone away. Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, is likely to be pulled into a drawn-out lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAnother cloud is the fate of Genesis, one of the biggest lenders in the crypto market, which filed for bankruptcy in January owing more than $3bn after the implosion of FTX.\n\nOwner Digital Currency Group, one of the world\u2019s largest owner of bitcoins via its asset management arm, is looking to raise funds to pay back Genesis creditors. DCG said last week some Genesis creditors had walked away from a previously agreed restructuring deal.\n\nThe market appears to be \u201cin a holding pattern pending the resolution of DCG\u2019s debt payments\u201d, said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of investment adviser Lumida Wealth Management.\n\nThe uncertainty, along with the crisis in the US regional banking industry, has underscored for many that the market is still working through its many issues.\n\n\u201cThere still isn\u2019t a lot of organic momentum behind cryptocurrencies,\u201d said Safai. \u201cThe headline events that propel cryptocurrency prices past sticking points . . are few and far between.\u201d`"

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 10 best Bitcoin stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. To skip the detailed analysis and recent updates about the cryptocurrency industry, go directly to the 5 Best Bitcoin Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds.\n\nBitcoin was launched in 2009 and since then it has had the most volatile movements among all asset classes. If we look at Bitcoin\u2019s price history, its shows some interesting trends. In 2010, Bitcoin was worth $0.9 and reached $26.9 in 2011. Over the years, it showed high volatility. In May 2017, Bitcoin was worth $2000 and reached over $19,000 in December of the same year.\n\nDuring these ups and downs, the brightest year for Bitcoin was noted in 2021 as we reported previously that the cryptocurrency had reached its peak at $69,000. Later in 2022, cryptocurrency experienced one of its biggest disasters known as the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d mainly due to the cryptocurrency exchange, FTX\u2019s scandal, combined with Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes due to rising inflation. It was estimated that Bitcoin would close out in 2022 at $16,800. The cryptocurrency traded at even less than the estimated amount at around $16,530 on December 31, 2022.\n\nThe FTX scandal was revealed when the digital currency news website, CoinDesk published an article stating that the FTX\u2019s sister firm Alameda Research\u2019s balance sheet was full of FTT tokens. It was later found that the capital provided by FTX to Alameda Research were customer deposits. This led Binance to sell all of its FTT tokens leading to a crash in its price which would later lead to a plethora of withdrawals from the exchange, creating a severe shortage of liquidity in the firm, thus leading to its bankruptcy.\n\nFTX\u2019s CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was later arrested and his bail bond was set at $250 million which is the largest one in history. The FTX collapse spread shockwaves among the industry and shepherded two major banks toward their collapse and a third one barely getting by and is currently being investigated by the US Department of Justice for accounts connected to Bankman-Fried's businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nCryptocurrency Outlook\n\nDespite facing a rough year in 2022, Bitcoin made a major comeback as it is up by 86.86% at the time of writing from its November lows and trading at $29,444, marking its highest price since June 2022. Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest predicted that the cryptocurrency\u2019s price may reach $1 million in 2023. The director of institutional sales at Paradigm believes that this is just the beginning of the rally for Bitcoin. He wrote:\n\n\"Now we've seen rates start to fall sharply, with the market pricing in rate cuts in the second half of the year. The Fed and ECB balance sheets are also back in expansion mode. This is the bullish thesis but on steroids.\" In addition, Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, said about cryptocurrencies:\n\n\"2023 will be a transition year from the vicious, frigid crypto winter of 2022 into something hopefully a lot hotter in 2024.\"\n\nMoreover, cryptocurrency stocks have also rallied significantly as cryptocurrency exchange platform, Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) has been up by around 60% year to date as of April 30, and cryptocurrency mining company Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) is up over 250% year to date. During this crypto rally, we have curated this list of best Bitcoin stocks to invest in according to hedge funds that include Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL).\n\n10 Best Bitcoin Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we chose the companies based on their hedge fund sentiment. The companies on the list are directly or indirectly involved in Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin trading, and broader crypto trading.\n\nThe hedge fund sentiment around each stock has been taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 943 elite hedge funds.\n\nBest Bitcoin Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds\n\n10.

(NASDAQ:IBKR) is a brokerage company dealing in cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, bonds, futures, and more. The firm started cryptocurrency trading in September 2021, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin, and Bitcoin cash.\n\nOn February 15, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) announced, in partnership with OSL Digital Securities, the launch of cryptocurrency trading in Hong Kong for clients who have investable assets worth $1 million and institutions who have $5 million and more.\n\nThe hedge sentiment was positive toward Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in Q4 with 42 hedge funds holding a stake, compared to 35 funds in Q3. After increasing its investment in the company by 18%, Bermuda-based Orbis Investment Management is the biggest shareholder with 4.2 million shares.\n\nVisa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Paypal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) are some of the prominent Bitcoin stocks on our list in addition to Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR).\n\nLVS Advisory mentioned Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what is said:\n\n\u201cThe most notable new position this year has been our investment in Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR). I published a detailed write-up (link here) and also appeared on the \u2018Yet Another Value Podcast\u2019 (link here) to discuss our IBKR thesis. To boil it down, IBKR benefits from higher interest rates, and the stock was available at an exceptionally cheap price. I believe IBKR represents a particularly good risk/reward bet and have made it our largest position.\u201d\n\n9. CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 58\n\nCME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is the leader of the financial derivatives market globally as it owns and operates multiple exchanges. Involved in the trading of cryptocurrencies futures, stock indexes, interest rates, and more, the group is one of the best Bitcoin stocks to invest in according to hedge funds.\n\nCME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is a dividend-paying stock that has increased its dividend for the last 13 years. At the time of writing, the company has a dividend yield of 2.37%. The company\u2019s latest dividend increase was recorded in February when it increased the quarterly dividend to $1.10 from $1.00.\n\nOn April 17, CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) announced the addition of new options to the range of standard and micro-sized Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) contracts with extended expiries.\n\nVGI Partners Global Investments Limited talked about CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) in its 2022 annual investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cCME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) is a business likely familiar to you, being one we have owned in our global strategy since 2008 and which was our largest VG1 position at the end of 2022. CME operates futures and derivatives exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, and the Dow Jones Index Services. On top of this, CME also owns other key assets related to foreign exchange trading & infrastructure and a strategic shareholding in Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) Index business. The key driver of trading activity for CME is in its interest rate derivatives products, where it has an effective monopoly in the exchange trading of interest rate derivatives in the United States, with benchmark products across the entirety of the interest rate curve. Demand for interest rate derivatives is driven by volatility in interest rate markets, whose effect is compounded by the number of bonds held by those looking to manage interest rate risk and, by extension, market liquidity. The below chart of average daily volumes of interest rate derivatives and US Federal debt held by the public illustrates the extremely strong relationship the size of the US Treasury market and volumes growth, although there are deviations around this primarily around Fed intervention (for example, at the start of the pandemic, volumes were suppressed by an enormous amount of Quantitative Easing (QE) and effectively zero interest rates which reduced the demand for hedging products). We expect the growth in the size of the US Treasury market, particularly in relation to privately held US treasuries as the Fed undergoes a balance sheet unwind, to remain a powerful underpinning of CME\u2019s interest rate derivatives business\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 70\n\nProviding its services in multiple countries, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a tech conglomerate with multiple products and services under its belt, including financial services and digital payment platforms. The latest step to penetrate the international crypto market taken by the company was in the form of partnering with Yellow Card. Through the partnership, Block\u2019s TBD will be used to send cross-border payments to any of the 16 African countries where Yellow Card operates.\n\nOn April 25, Credit Suisse lowered the price target of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)\u2019s shares from $105 to $100 while maintaining an Outperform rating. According to the firm, the company\u2019s gross profit estimates will be a little lower but the business model is set to experience any \u201cdisclosure and more conservative GPV growth in the second half of 2023\u201d.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database, 70 hedge funds held a stake in Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) worth $4.255 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. ARK Investment Management was the biggest shareholder with a little over 9 million shares in Q4 2022.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cBlock, Inc. provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block\u2019s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.\u201d\n\n7. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 71\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is headquartered in New York and is one of the most prominent financial services companies. Along with offering card products, it is the biggest issuer of travelers\u2019 cheques globally. The company got involved in Bitcoin when it announced to launch a crypto card in collaboration with Abra, a fintech company.\n\nOn April 20, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) reported an EPS of $2.40 and revenue of $14.28 billion in Q1 2023, beating expectations by $260 million. The 21.7% YoY growth was a result of card members spending more during the quarter and increased interest income with elevated average loan volumes.\n\nOn March 8, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) announced a 15% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share. The other announcement was the commencement of a share repurchase program of nearly 120 million common shares.\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 91\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leader in the automotive and clean energy industry. The company earned $64 million on Bitcoin in 2022 because of its trading activities and currently owns $184 million worth of Bitcoin.\n\nAs per Insider Monkey\u2019s database, the company has seen positive sentiment in Q4 2022 compared to the previous quarter as the number of hedge funds holding a stake in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) increased to 91 in Q4 from 88 in Q3. Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel Investment Group was the most significant stakeholder as it increased its holding in the company by 179% to 7.5 million worth $926.2 million.\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was mentioned in the first-quarter 2023 investor letter of Aristotle Atlantic Partners. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was a negative contributor to performance due to our underweight position relative to Russell 1000 Growth Index, as the company had strong performance in Q1. The strength occurred after the company partially reversed a previously announced price cut for its electric vehicles following a period of strong demand. Tesla also reported better-than-expected results for Q4 2022 during the first quarter. Tesla Motors designs, develops, manufactures, and markets high-performance, technologically advanced electric cars and solar energy generation and energy storage products. Tesla sells more than five fully electric cars, among others, the Model X and Y SUVs, as well as the Model S sedan and Model 3 sedan. The company has a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are industrial grade, high-speed vehicle chargers, typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow Tesla owners quick and reliable charging. Tesla offers certain advanced driver assist systems under its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving options. US customers generate nearly half of Tesla\u2019s sales. We see Tesla as the leading manufacturer of battery powered electric vehicles (EVs). The company has achieved scaled production of EVs before the other large automobile manufacturers. The company\u2019s technology in battery production and self-driving technology is more mature than competitors\u2019 offerings. EVs are one of the fastest growing categories within automobile manufacturing. The profit margin in the automotive segment is significantly above automotive competitors which provides the company flexibility to price its vehicles more strategically as the competition eventually scales up their EV production. The direct-to-consumer sales model gives the company more control over its relationship with its customers as well as a source of higher profit margin since there is no dealership share of the profits.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Bitcoin Stocks to Invest in According to Hedge Funds.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In Silicon Valley, Tim Draper is venture capital royalty. A third-generation investor, Draper was an early backer of some of the most pivotal technology to come out of California, from Hotmail to Skype. In recent years, his focus has been on Bitcoin and the broader ethos of decentralization, famously paying $19 million for 30,000 Bitcoin in 2014 that had been seized in the U.S. government takedown of dark web marketplace Silk Road.\n\nWhile some of his bets have not paid off\u2014including an investment in Theranos and repeated predictions that Bitcoin would reach $250,000\u2014he is continuing to throw his chips in with the pioneer cryptocurrency. In an interview with Fortune, Draper said he expects Bitcoin to soar in value amid economic uncertainty in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIf the bear gets that angry to where the banks start falling apart, that actually means that Bitcoin will have a bull market,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a raging bull in the middle of the bear.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is currently sitting at just under $29,000. It\u2019s up nearly 75% since the beginning of 2023 amid the failures of major U.S. banks Signature, Silicon Valley Bank, and First Republic.\n\nDraper\u2019s support of Bitcoin does not extend to the entire crypto ecosystem. While he backed pioneering projects like the blockchain Tezos, he said he\u2019s wary of companies that are too centralized. Draper said he twice turned down an investment opportunity in Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s now-failed exchange FTX, arguing that there was no utility for its proprietary token, FTT, except for speculation.\n\nAs FTX rose in popularity in 2021 and 2022, Draper said he thought he had missed something, but was vindicated in November when the company collapsed in spectacular fashion.\n\n\u201cI just thought it was a race to the bottom,\u201d Draper said about CeFi, or centralized finance, companies like FTX.\n\nHis concern now is with crypto regulation, as lawmakers debate legislation to establish guardrails for the industry and agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission target firms with enforcement actions. Draper said that when he speaks with startups in the space, they ask him about regulation, which had never before been the case.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re regulating by enforcement, they\u2019re just slapping people down and fining them and suing them,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste years of my life in court and trying to avoid some problem.\u201d\n\nDraper, who has advocated for breaking up California into six states, said that the only solution is to have a new political party in charge.\n\n\u201cThis is as controlling as the U.S. government has ever been,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re ruining business, they\u2019re killing the golden goose, and Silicon Valley is breaking up because of it.\u201d"

        "title": "Biden Wants 30% Crypto Mining Tax, But Can It Work? - Investopedia",
        "content": "President Joe Biden has proposed an up to 30% tax on cryptocurrency mining aimed at deterring economic and environmental concerns, but experts say the plan would be tough to implement.\n\nKey Takeaways President Biden wants to tax up to 30% of crypto miners' electricity costs in three years as part of his proposed 2024 federal budget.\n\nThe White House said the tax was aimed at curbing environmental and economic concerns.\n\nThe tax would mostly affect bitcoin miners, as other major crypto networks use proof-of-stake (PoS) rather than proof-of-work (PoW).\n\nCritics of the tax proposal say that miners could easily move offshore to avoid taxation.\n\nThe White House Wants To Make Miners Pay\n\nIntroduced in President Biden's 2024 federal budget, the proposal for the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax would tax up to 30% of crypto miners' electricity costs\u2014in 10% increments spread over three years starting January 2024. The tax, expected to raise about $3.5 billion over 10 years, is geared toward combating climate change.\n\n\"Currently, crypto mining firms do not have to pay for the full cost they impose on others, in the form of local environmental pollution, higher energy prices, and the impacts of increased greenhouse gas emissions on the climate. The DAME tax encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society,\" the President's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) wrote in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe CEA estimates crypto mining in the United States consumed as much electricity in 2022 as all the country's home computers or residential lighting.\n\nNotably, Biden's proposed tax on crypto mining would affect bitcoin more than the rest of the crypto market, as it is the only major crypto network that uses proof-of-work (PoW) as its underlying mechanism for achieving consensus. Other networks, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain, use an alternative method known as proof-of-stake (PoS), which uses much less energy.\n\n\n\nThe crypto industry, however, contends a large share of crypto mining relies on sustainable energy sources.\n\nWhile proponents of cryptocurrency tout enhancing financial inclusion, security, and transparency as its benefits, the CEA said crypto's \"broader social benefits have yet to materialize.\"\n\nChallenges In Implementing Crypto Mining Tax\n\nOf course, a key issue with any crypto-related tax policy is this industry is a global phenomenon. If taxes on crypto mining in the United States are too high, then miners could move to a more favorable jurisdiction. Especially, as the limited supply of bitcoin increases competition among miners and the rewards for mining bitcoin diminish.\n\nWhile the administration's plan acknowledges the risk of miners moving abroad it does little to ensure that mining operations do not shuffle between states in search of the lowest tax rates,\n\nCastle Island Ventures Founding Partner Nic Carter tweeted. New York, for example, banned bitcoin mining operations that use carbon-based energy last year. Among countries, China banned crypto mining in 2021.\n\n\"To ensure that crypto mining is not simply pushed from one local community to another, a national policy is needed,\" the CEA said.\n\n"

        "content": "As for the exact details of how the hack happened, while the U.S. Department of Justice later fingered a Russian crypto exchange runner named Alexander Vinnik for laundering Mt. Gox\u2019s stolen bitcoin, the exact cause and culprit of the hack is \u201cstill a mystery,\u201d says Walbroehl. (The prevailing view by many in the space is that while Karpel\u00e8s was sloppy and perhaps even negligent with safeguarding the Mt. Gox data, he was not the mastermind and did not act with malice. Karpel\u00e8s was found guilty in court for manipulating data, but not for embezzling or hacking funds.) So who\u2019s the real villain here? The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is the juiciest unsolved mystery in the crypto space, but the question of who hacked Mt. Gox is arguably the runner-up."

        "content": "A pseudonymous leftist Twitter account won $1 million from crypto investor Balaji Srinivasan over a bet on US inflation.\n\n\n\nHolly Newman Kroft: Quartz Smart Investing Part 2 CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video Is it time to sell your tech stocks?\n\nThe account\u2019s handle, @jdcmedlock, is nominally assigned to one James Medlock, but that isn\u2019t the user\u2019s real name. To their 83,000-odd followers, Medlock tweets frequently about economics, which is how they became embroiled in their bet with Srinivasan in March.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bet was announced after Medlock tweeted that he\u2019d bet anyone $1 million that the US wouldn\u2019t enter hyperinflation. Srinivasan, who had been warning about the risk of hyperinflation, took him up on the bet, setting a term of 90 days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTechnically, the bet wasn\u2019t precisely based on US hyperinflation. Rather, Srinivasan bet that bitcoin\u2014which he views as a hedge against inflation\u2014would be worth $1 million at the end of 90 days, its value rising as inflation spiraled upwards. Srinivasan did not seem to consider the possibility that bitcoin\u2019s value might also be wiped out in a hyperinflationary environment, the economics writer Noah Smith wrote on his blog.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately for B alaji Srinivasan, inflation is headed down\n\n\n\nWith the Federal Reserve bent on taming prices and cooling the economy, hyperinflation was a distant prospect. T he bet was extremely unlikely to go in Srinivasan\u2019s favor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe joke itself was that, in the event of hyperinflation, the million dollars wouldn\u2019t be worth very much anyways, so it was a no-lose situation,\u201d Medlock told Quartz over email. \u201cBut hyperinflation is extremely rare, usually happening in times of conflict or institutional collapse. With the US dollar being the global reserve currency and our institutions being relatively stable, hyperinflation today would be without precedent. In fact, a banking crisis might end up being deflationary, as the loss of deposits would reduce demand.\u201d\n\nThe bet was set on March 17, but it was settled early. Srinivasan did not immediately respond to a request for comment about why he had paid out well before the 90-day term, but it appeared to be his way of making a point. \u201cI spent my own money to send a provably costly signal that there\u2019s something wrong with the economy, and that it\u2019s not going to be merely a financial crisis, but a fiat crisis,\u201d Srinivasan w rote in a blog post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedlock, a self-described \u201ctax enthusiast,\u201d plans to pay an effective tax rate of 70%. Taxes on the winnings will only total $240,000, but Medlock has already given $500,000 of the money to Give Directly, a poverty charity. Srinivasan gave an additional $500,000 to bitcoin core developers, bringing the bet\u2019s total value to $1.5 million.\n\nMedlock has plans for the rest of the money. \u201cI\u2019ll pay off some debt, build a nice cat house for my neighborhood feral, and invest in a much better investment than BTC, namely low-fee index funds.\u201d"

Moroccan customs consider the use of cryptocurrency to be an illegal transfer of funds.\n\nHe was incarcerated in December 2021 for \"fraud\" and \"payment with foreign currency on Moroccan territory\" and sentenced last October to 18 months in prison \u2013 on top of which he received a fine of around \u20ac3.4 million.\n\nThe proceedings were initiated following a complaint of \"fraud\" filed by a French woman, resident in Casablanca, who had sold him a Ferrari in exchange for a Bitcoin payment worth \u20ac400,000.\n\nClausi was also the subject of another complaint, this time from a Moroccan citizen who accused him of signing a bad check in the name of a third person \u2013 obtained by the young Frenchman in exchange for Bitcoin \u2013 to buy three luxury watches. The court ordered him to compensate the owner of the watches to the tune of 40,000 dirhams (\u20ac3,900).\n\n\"He has one month and a few days left in prison\", noted Aghanaj.\n\nAccording to Clausi's father, the young man, who hails from Moselle in eastern France, had moved to Morocco with a plan to create a neobank in Africa.\n\nEarlier this year, Moroccan authorities extradited another French citizen to the US to face criminal charges related to cybercrimes.\n\nS\u00e9bastien Raoult is suspected of being a member of a hacker group known as ShinyHunters, a \"black hat\" group alleged to have stolen and sold data from numerous major companies."

(Nasdaq: CLSK), America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122, today released its unaudited bitcoin mining and operations update for the month ending April 30, 2023.\n\n\"Our high efficiency measures and low power rates have made meaningful contributions to our margins this month even as difficulty has substantially increased,\u201d said Zach Bradford, CEO. \u201cThe result of these efforts is that while we have mined fewer bitcoin this month, the bitcoin we have mined is being driven to our bottom line. As we look to the next few months, we expect Washington to be fully energized, which will bump our hashrate as we maintain our competitive edge in these tight market conditions. We are looking forward to sharing our quarterly performance in more detail, including some exciting updates on our expansion plans in Washington and Sandersville, on our earnings call next week. We hope shareholders and other stakeholders will tune in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to make meaningful progress toward optimizing the operational efficiency of our fleet as we work toward becoming the most efficient miner in North America,\u201d said Taylor Monnig, CleanSpark\u2019s vice president of mining technology. \u201cCleanSpark\u2019s uptime is already apparent in terms of realized hashrate, which is essentially the amount of time our mining operations are fully online. We expect to maintain that edge as the pace of deliveries for the newly released S19J Pro+ machines ramp up and are installed at our Sandersville and Washington facilities. Later this year, Sandersville will also host the bulk of the XPs, 45,000 in total, that we announced a few weeks ago, accelerating important upgrades to our fleet efficiency.\u201d\n\nApril Bitcoin Mining Update (unaudited)\n\nBitcoin mined in April: 524\n\nCY2023 bitcoin mined: 2,395\n\nTotal BTC holdings as of April 30: 313\n\nTotal BTC converted for operations and growth in April: 407\n\nCurrently deployed fleet of about 67,700 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a hashrate of 6.7 EH/s\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Company funded growth and operations through the sale of 407 bitcoins in April 2023 at an average of approximately $29,000 per BTC. Sales of BTC equated to proceeds of approximately $11.8 million. April daily BTC mined averaged 17.47 and reached a high of 18.17.\n\nAbout CleanSpark\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK) is America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122. Since 2014, we\u2019ve helped people achieve energy independence for their homes and businesses. In 2020, we transitioned that expertise to develop sustainable infrastructure for Bitcoin, an essential tool for financial independence and inclusion.

The next Bitcoin halving is expected to occur in April or May 2024, roughly a year from now.\n\nWhile the event may seem insignificant, it has historically been followed by significant price increases in Bitcoin, and this presents an excellent opportunity for investors to buy Bitcoin today and potentially benefit from the price increase that follows.\n\nWhy the halving matters\n\nThe halving process is a critical part of what makes Bitcoin so unique and is used to manage the supply of coins entering circulation. Hardwired into its code, roughly every four years (or after 210,000 blocks have been added to the blockchain) this halving event takes place and reduces the number of Bitcoins awarded to miners, which is the primary way new coins are created.\n\nEssentially, the halving process creates scarcity of Bitcoin, which in turn drives up the price of the cryptocurrency. As the supply of Bitcoin becomes more limited, demand usually goes up, leading to an increase in price. This is very different from the process of splitting a stock, which simply divides the same asset into a larger number of smaller slices. Halving is a fundamental change to the relative value of each new Bitcoin in a strictly controlled total market.\n\nInitially, the mining reward was a whopping 50 Bitcoins. But since then, there have been two more halvings and today the mining reward sits at 6.25 Bitcoins. However, this number is set to change once again in about a year when Bitcoin undergoes its next halving -- and that's the main reason I won't stop buying Bitcoin today.\n\nWhat the numbers say\n\nBy looking at Bitcoin's historical price roughly a year before and after each halving event, you can see a pattern of significant price increases.\n\nWhile buying Bitcoin at the time of each halving would provide considerable returns, the most lucrative returns are made when buying in preparation for the halving, especially when it's a year away.\n\nIn the time between a year before and after the first halving in November 2012, it rose more than 43,000% when it climbed from roughly $2.50 to nearly $1,100. The next halving was in July 2016 and, while not as significant an increase, it was still extremely lucrative. As a result of this halving, Bitcoin increased from $280 to around $2,225, a 640% increase. And finally, the most recent halving. A year before May 2020, Bitcoin's price was a measly $6,975. But a year after the halving, it ascended 609% to reach a price of $49,500.\n\nWhile hindsight is always 20/20, the numbers don't lie. A year before an upcoming halving has proven to be a great time to buy Bitcoin while its price remains discounted. And it seems like this remains the case today. This is a planned event that adds a straightforward amount of value to existing Bitcoins, so I'm not trying to time an unpredictable market. Of course, the price trend could take different turns this time as investors adapt to the well-documented halving effect, but the larger point remains the same: Bitcoin should become more valuable over time due to its limited supply.\n\nThe game plan\n\nDespite its strong rally to start off 2023, rising more than 70%, Bitcoin's price is still a far cry from its all-time high of more than $68,000. While the first halving was likely an outlier due to its massive price appreciation (43,000%), if Bitcoin were to make a similar return to the last two halvings of around 600%, that would see it reach a price tag of more than $200,000.\n\nThis may sound like trying to time the market, but in reality, it's quite the opposite. While buying a year before the halving and selling a year after might seem like a foolproof way to generate some returns, there are potential gains missed out.\n\nIn reality, the true goal is to buy and hold for multiple halving cycles. If past trends continue, then the longer you hold on to those precious Bitcoins, the more likely they are to appreciate at a rate few other assets can even come close to. For that reason alone, Bitcoin is worth heavy consideration with its heavily discounted price and the next halving set for next year."

        "title": "Energy-Efficient Bitcoin Mining through Light - Optics & Photonics News",
        "content": "As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies grow in size and popularity, their processing eats up an ever-greater fraction of the world\u2019s electricity supply. But a collaboration between researchers in the United States and Italy has now shown it might be possible to slash that consumption while still maintaining network security by using integrated photonic circuits to implement a modified type of proof-of-work blockchain (Optica, doi: 10.1364/OPTICA.476173).\n\nBitcoin and blockchain\n\nBitcoin enables decentralized, censorship-resistant transactions thanks to the way that those transactions are parceled up into blocks and verified by individuals or organizations known as miners. Miners from around the world compete with one another to process each block and add it to the blockchain. They do so about once every ten minutes, with the winner in each case being awarded a certain amount of bitcoin.\n\nAdding a block involves using a so-called hash function to convert the block\u2019s transaction data into a fixed-length string of bits. The resulting \u201chash\u201d uniquely identifies the block in question and is referenced by all successive blocks. Since it is essentially impossible to reverse the process to derive the original data from their associated hash, the blockchain serves as an immutable record of irreversible transactions\u2014making it attractive for a range of other applications, such as safekeeping contracts, preserving medical data and counting votes.\n\nHashing is designed to be complex\u2014and to become more complex with time\u2014to guarantee the network\u2019s security. But that, in turn, means that competing miners have to invest in increasingly powerful processors and consume an ever-growing amount of electricity. As of 2021, cryptocurrency mining consumed more energy than all of Sweden.\n\nMore on hardware, less on electricity\n\nIn the latest work, Sunil Pai, David Miller and colleagues at Stanford University, working with researchers at New York University and the non-profit organization PoWx\u2014all in the United States\u2014and others at the Polytechnic University of Milan, Italy, propose using integrated photonics to limit energy consumption. Their scheme still involves a proof-of-work blockchain\u2014one that relies on computational effort (verified by other miners) to certify blocks. But rather than using Bitcoin\u2019s SHA-256 hash function, the scheme instead employs a function optimized for energy-efficient analog photonic chips.\n\nThe chips are built up from Mach-Zehnder interferometers, which consist of beam splitters and phase shifters incorporated into waveguides. The interferometers are arranged and manipulated in such a way that laser light passing through the circuit and then measured at the device\u2019s output provides the answers to specific matrix multiplications\u2014a key part of processing hash functions. Although energy is needed to convert electric currents into light and back again, as well as to tune the interferometers, the researchers say the passive nature of the calculations should save a lot of energy overall.\n\nAs the researchers explain, their overall goal is to change the way that miners allocate resources\u2014incentivizing them to spend more on their hardware and less on electricity. In this way, they argue, cryptocurrency mining should become less concentrated in those areas of the globe that receive the cheapest electricity while also becoming more resilient to fluctuating energy prices.\n\nLightHash, a new function\n\nAuthors Bogdan Penkovsky and Michael Dubrovsky of PoWx have previously outlined an optics-friendly hash function known as HeavyHash. This function is currently being tested on two smaller cryptocurrency networks, but it is very susceptible to errors in the analog optical hardware, such as loss or coupling mismatches. The new function, known as LightHash, is designed to overcome these problems by optimizing the trade-off between circuit size and accuracy and by averaging the outputs from multiple copies of the same circuit.\n\nTo demonstrate the potential of this scheme, the researchers ran computer simulations and experimentally tested an interferometer network capable of processing matrices with as many as four rows and columns. They found that the likelihood of errors shot up dramatically as the number of inputs and outputs increased, but they also showed that using four copies of the circuit can reduce the rate of errors in hashing by up to four orders of magnitude.\n\nFuture outlook\n\nDespite their scheme\u2019s susceptibility to errors, Pai and colleagues conclude that it could make photonic blockchains a reality\u2014reducing energy consumption by up to a factor of seven. They add that the technology might enable other applications, as they reported in a separate paper how the same experimental chip can be used to train a photonic neural network.\n\nHowever, the researchers say that the technology must be scaled up significantly before it can enter the marketplace\u2014from 4 to 64 inputs and as many outputs. They are also aiming to further minimize energy consumption by tuning the interferometers with electromechanical components and improving the optical-to-electrical converters.\n\nEven if these technical hurdles can be overcome, it still remains to be seen just how popular the photonic processors would be with Bitcoin enthusiasts. But the researchers envisage introducing the new technology slowly, gradually increasing the fraction of bitcoin mining done photonically. Plus, as Pai points out, the new hash function, although a break with the past, does incorporate SHA-256. This, he says, should \u201cstrengthen its case for adoption.\u201d\n\nCorrection, 4 May 2023, 08:25 EDT: This story has been updated to clarify the way that LightHash overcomes problems."

On Wednesday, Polygon said it added updates to its network to improve use of decentralized applications, or dApps.\n\nRipple dipped 0.32% to US$0.4635.\n\nMemecoins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have also gained this year and Gordon Grant, co-head of trading at digital currency prime brokerage Genesis Trading, said failing banks could be a reason.\n\n\u201cThe rise of meme coins amid a full-on banking crisis is not necessarily surprising. Amidst unstable banking systems, individuals may question the validity of their deposits and even the meaning of money,\u201d Grant said in emailed comments.\n\n\u201cIf bank deposits can theoretically evaporate overnight, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that there is a marginal propensity to put money into a token with no obvious use-case other than the chance of selling at a higher price later.\u201d\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 1.14% in the past 24 hours to US$1.20 trillion, while trading volume gained 19.42% to US$41.97 billion.\n\nNFTs\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures lost 0.41%, the S&P 500 futures index dipped 0.37%, and the Nasdaq-100 futures edged down 0.03%. The three indexes all closed lower in regular Wednesday trading.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by the expected 25 basis points to between 5 and 5.25%, the highest level since 2006. The Fed has repeatedly raised rates over the past year to try and bring inflation down to its target range of 2%. The inflation rate in March was at 5%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Statistics.\n\nIn announcing the increase the central bank\u2019s chairman Jerome Powell damped down expectations that the Fed is now set to pause its policy of raising rates, saying the bank is \u201cprepared to do more if greater monetary policy restraint is warranted,\u201d during a press conference.\n\nNigel Green, the chief executive officer of financial advisory company deVere Group, said raising rates amid the brewing uncertainty about the health of U.S. banks is a mistake and could push the world\u2019s largest economy into a longer-term recession.\n\n\u201cFirst, the crisis within the US financial system is still not over. There remain serious and legitimate concerns that after a string of bank failures, there could be more to come,\u201d Green said in an emailed statement.\n\nAnother U.S. inflation indicator is due this week when job numbers for April are released on Friday.\n\nSee related article: Crypto miner Bitdeer expands to Bhutan, partners state-owned investment arm"

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s BRC-20 token standard has become the latest trend in the crypto ecosystem, especially after the Pepe (PEPE) memecoin rise in recent months. A total of 8,500 different tokens have been minted using the BRC-20 standard, with the majority of these BRC-20 tokens being memecoins, such as PEPE and Memetic (MEME).\n\nBRC-20 is an experimental token standard on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain modeled on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20. It allows programmers to create and send fungible tokens via the Ordinals protocol.\n\nAlthough modeled after ERC-20, the BRC-20 token standard fundamentally differs from its Ethereum-based counterpart. BRC-20 tokens don\u2019t make use of smart contracts. The token standard also requires a Bitcoin wallet to mint and trade these tokens.\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard was created early in March by an anonymous on-chain analyst called Domo. The objective was to make it possible for fungible tokens to be issued and transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain. The market cap of BRC-20 tokens has exploded over the past month and currently sits at $120 million, a 600% rise in the past week.\n\nBRC-20 tokens marketcap. Source: Ordinals\n\nThe BRC-20 token frenzy has also dwarfed the blockchain\u2019s original number of Bitcoin transactions. The number of BRC-20 transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain between April 29 and May 2 reached over 50%, outperforming regular BTC transactions.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin metrics to the moon: ATH for hash rate, daily transactions and Ordinals\n\nThe BRC-20 token volume peaked on May 1 at 366,000 transactions, with the total number of transactions on the network being 2.36 million.\n\nBRC-20 tokens transaction volume. Source: Dune\n\nAlong with the rise in BRC-20 transactions, transaction fees have surged due to the new token activity. Since its inception in late April, the network has generated an additional 109.7 BTC in transaction fees for miners.\n\nBRC-20 tokens total fees. Source: Dune\n\nThe memecoin frenzy has been a notable topic on the Ethereum blockchain, but with the rise of the BRC-20 standard, a similar trend is also observed on the Bitcoin blockchain. The memecoin craze has also led to a significant rise in Ethereum network gas fees, contributing to network congestion.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

        "content": "In Silicon Valley, Tim Draper is venture capital royalty. A third-generation investor, Draper was an early backer of some of the most pivotal technology to come out of California, from Hotmail to Skype. In recent years, his focus has been on Bitcoin and the broader ethos of decentralization, famously paying $19 million for 30,000 Bitcoin in 2014 that had been seized in the U.S. government takedown of dark web marketplace Silk Road.\n\nMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home Looking to make extra cash?

In an interview with Fortune, Draper said he expects Bitcoin to soar in value amid economic uncertainty in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIf the bear gets that angry to where the banks start falling apart, that actually means that Bitcoin will have a bull market,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a raging bull in the middle of the bear.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is currently sitting at just under $29,000. It\u2019s up nearly 75% since the beginning of 2023 amid the failures of major U.S. banks Signature, Silicon Valley Bank, and First Republic.\n\nDraper\u2019s support of Bitcoin does not extend to the entire crypto ecosystem. While he backed pioneering projects like the blockchain Tezos, he said he\u2019s wary of companies that are too centralized. Draper said he twice turned down an investment opportunity in Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s now-failed exchange FTX, arguing that there was no utility for its proprietary token, FTT, except for speculation.\n\nAs FTX rose in popularity in 2021 and 2022, Draper said he thought he had missed something, but was vindicated in November when the company collapsed in spectacular fashion.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI just thought it was a race to the bottom,\u201d Draper said about CeFi, or centralized finance, companies like FTX.\n\nHis concern now is with crypto regulation, as lawmakers debate legislation to establish guardrails for the industry and agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission target firms with enforcement actions. Draper said that when he speaks with startups in the space, they ask him about regulation, which had never before been the case.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re regulating by enforcement, they\u2019re just slapping people down and fining them and suing them,\u201d he told Fortune. \u201cI don\u2019t want to waste years of my life in court and trying to avoid some problem.\u201d\n\nDraper, who has advocated for breaking up California into six states, said that the only solution is to have a new political party in charge.\n\n\u201cThis is as controlling as the U.S. government has ever been,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re ruining business, they\u2019re killing the golden goose, and Silicon Valley is breaking up because of it.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune:\n\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\n\nLooking to make extra cash?

        "content": "A spike in transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain involving Ethereum-style tokens and non-fungible token (NFT)-like \u201cinscriptions\u201d has driven up congestion on the network, pushing the average fee rate to the highest in nearly two years while showering miners of the cryptocurrency with extra revenue.\n\nOn Wednesday, the average fee per Bitcoin transaction rose to $7.25, the highest since July 2021. For comparison, the rate so far this year had fluctuated between roughly 50 cents and $4, data from BitInfoCharts shows.\n\nWith transaction activity also surging, total fees on Bitcoin have also jumped.\n\nPer blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin\u2019s total transaction fees, which are paid by users to miners, jumped to around 124 BTC or roughly $3.5 million, on May 3, representing a 484% increase in the past 14 days.\n\n\u201cThis current fee spree is an anomaly,\u201d wrote Colin Harper, head of content at Luxor Technologies, a full-stack Bitcoin mining pool.\n\nBitcoin: Total Transaction Fees (Glassnode)\n\nIn recent days, a token type called BRC-20 (a play on Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token standard), which facilitates the issue and transfer of fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, has accounted for about 6% of all Bitcoin activity since its inception in early March, according to pseudonymous analyst and yield farmer Dynamo DeFi. This year has also seen the rise of Ordinals inscriptions, which are similar to NFTs and could be images or text strings inscribed into Bitcoin-based transactions. Both activities require transaction fees.\n\n\u201cInscriptions are the primary driver here,\u201d said Harper. \u201cBiggest difference now between this jump in transaction fees and past ones with inscriptions is that BRC-20 standard is a new way to inscribe. Adoption of this standard is driving fees up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe increase in transaction volume of that token standard has driven up demand for Bitcoin blockspace,\u201d said Jimmy Zhang, who works in the business operations and strategy department at blockchain data firm Artemis.\n\nKydo, vice president of Stanford Blockchain Club, told CoinDesk via direct messages on Telegram that \"Blockspace is the core commodity on any blockchain. People have found a new use case and the usage skyrocketed. BTC is more than money now.\" Kydo said they only use the one name publicly because of privacy concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nMiners who secure and maintain the Bitcoin network are beneficiaries of the recent increase in BTC transaction fees because they are rewarded in BTC fees for processing users\u2019 transactions.\n\nHarper predicts the increased transaction fees currently occurring in the ecosystem are \u201ca temporary phenomenon, though, and that transaction fees will revert back to a manageable mean soon.\u201d\n\nKydo said they think the current phenomenon will last a while, \"given how much people like NFTs.\"\n\nThe price of BTC has increased 1.2% in the past 24 hours to $28,884, at press time. The average transaction fee on Bitcoin is $7.25. According to data website cryptofees.info, Bitcoin\u2019s seven-day average fee stands at roughly $2 million, second only behind Ethereum\u2019s $12.5 million. BNB Smart Chain is next with about $575,000."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin has surged 70% so far this year, but market liquidity for the world's top cryptocurrency is drying up.\n\nThat means smaller trades can increasingly move bitcoin prices. For example, a purchase of 462 bitcoins ($13 million) at the end of last month was able to move the price by 1% versus more than 1,400 bitcoins ($23 million) in January, according to CCData, cited by the Financial Times.\n\nThat's the lowest point of market depth for bitcoin trades via the stablecoin tether since May 2022, when the crypto market was reeling from price crashes and the failure of key industry players.\n\nOverall liquidity in the market has been declining since the start of the year, CCData research analyst Jacob Joseph told Insider over email.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's worth noting that the decline in Binance's market share in April may have also contributed to the decline in liquidity for the above BTC-USDT pair,\" he added.\n\nBinance's woes may be related to a crackdown by regulators on the crypto exchange firm. Meanwhile, last year's collapse of FTX and sister firm Alameda created a gap in liquidity that other crypto firms have been unable to fill, traders told the FT.\n\nAnd while bitcoin's price has been on the up, especially as banking turbulence caused renewed confidence in the currency, it has stagnated lately.\n\nIn recent weeks, bitcoin has languished in the $28,000-$29,000 range. That has coincided with outflows of $72 million in digital asset investments over the last two weeks after six consecutive weeks of inflows, according to CoinShares data cited by the FT."

        "content": "Institutional investors lost interest in crypto after 2022 and even with this year's uptrend, their appetite for it hasn't come back yet, according to Northern Trust's head of digital assets and financial markets.\n\nJustin Chapman told CNBC's \"Crypto World\" at the Digital Assets Week conference in San Francisco that institutions have shifted their focus to cryptocurrencies' underlying blockchain technology, but that his firm \"has capabilities\" in place should client interest in crypto assets rebound.\n\n\"Just after March the crypto market went off a cliff\u2026 the client interest has definitely gone off the same cliff in terms of institutional interest in in cryptocurrencies,\" he said.\n\n\"It's definitely quiet now, since 2022, from the institutional side,\" he continued. \"Before that, we were seeing traditional fund managers looking to launch crypto funds, ETPs in Europe, which is the equivalent of ETFs in the U.S. \u2014 that's really gone quiet. Even the hedge funds, who are pretty active in the markets, have certainly reduced their exposure within that particular space.\"\n\nMeanwhile, leaders from the biggest financial institutions gathered at the San Francisco conference were energized when it came to the blockchain technology \u2013 specifically its potential to help tokenize real-world assets like gold for clients.\n\nThe \"evolution of the technology\" is moving into a \"better place\" in terms of support from market participants, Chapman said.\n\n\"As a firm, we have capabilities that sit there to administer [crypto trading] functions, but it's a pretty quiet market at the moment and [after] most of the issues we had last year, we haven't seen a rebound at all on the institutional side yet,\" he said.\n\nSpecifically, Northern Trust partnered with Standard Chartered in 2020 to launch Zodia, a crypto custodian for institutional investors.\n\nBitcoin has gained almost 75% this year after losing 64% in 2022. Trading was still to begin the year, with volatility falling to historic lows. The regulatory crackdown in the U.S. been a dark cloud over the industry while the banking crisis has helped push bitcoin's price higher. Both have brought volatility back to the market. Even as bitcoin currently struggles to break above the $30,000 level, investors agree it remains in a long-term uptrend.\n\n\"We're not focused that much on the asset class because the client isn't at the moment,\" Chapman said. \"So we're not seeing that appetite to have that within their portfolios. If that changes, as a firm, we can account for those capabilities. But it's certainly lost its shine from the institutional perspective.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin mining could help spur more investment in renewable energy because the industry can use \u201cstranded\u201d energy from solar, wind or other forms of renewable electricity generation, argues Andrew Webber, chief executive officer of Digital Power Optimization.\n\nIn an interview with Forkast, Webber, the founder of the New York-based company that helps energy firms build crypto mining operations, said Bitcoin mining can help make renewable energy more profitable and \u201cif you can make renewable energy more profitable to build, people will build more of it.\u201d\n\nThe following Q&A had been edited for clarity and length.\n\nTimmy Shen: Could you tell me more about your company and how you work with energy firms?\n\nAndrew Webber: We use flexible data centers, Bitcoin mining or flexible AI (artificial intelligence) computing to deploy the assets and operations at energy sites where you generate power \u2013 whether that\u2019s wind power, hydropower or solar power. We use some of that excess energy, or energy that would otherwise have been undervalued by the market or stranded in a remote location because there\u2019s not enough transmission to get that power from one site to where it\u2019s going to be used.\n\nBy deploying a flexible data center at these generation assets, they can govern how much power they\u2019re using versus how much power they\u2019re selling into the grid. It creates this really profitable off-take scenario for them where they can capture incremental value for their energy.\n\nSo we think of this entire ecosystem not necessarily as a separate industry. We think that the idea of Bitcoin mining flexible data centers is one that\u2019s going to be picked up and utilized by the energy sector as a vertically integrated strategy \u2013 the same way they think about battery deployments at their sites, or green hydrogen production in the same way using excess available energy to electrolyze water and end up with hydrogen as a new fossil-free fuel.\n\nAndrew Webber, chief executive officer of Digital Power Optimization\n\nShen: How do you decide when you would like to turn off or turn on the computing power?\n\nWebber: It\u2019s really our partners\u2019 decision, but we help them think through that.\n\nThe idea is that you can basically keep running your data center based on a certain price in the grid. If grid prices or your opportunity cost for selling that power exceeds what you can make by using it for your data center, you just turn the data center off and that power can be redirected into the grid.\n\nI\u2019ll use an example \u2013 the 2021 winter storm in Texas. There was a huge price spike because there was not enough generation. Everybody needed to turn their heaters on. There was this huge demand for more power but there wasn\u2019t enough power. So grid prices went to like US$9,000 per megawatt hour, which is absolutely insane. And all Bitcoin miners turned off during that period because they didn\u2019t want to operate when power prices were that high. They would rather turn their mines off and sell their power into that elevated market so they make more money. But the grid also gets the extra power that it needs to offset some of those increased prices. So as a load-balancing mechanism for a given power grid, it\u2019s a really powerful tool to help fit the demands that society needs.\n\nShen: How profitable is Bitcoin mining and what factors would miners consider when they decide when to turn off their machines?\n\nWebber: The profitability of Bitcoin mining is set mostly by spot price and the amount of competition and network difficulty. Those things move together.\n\nThose two elements are really key drivers in deciding when and how a flexible data center might operate relative to grid prices.\n\nShen: Is there a certain threshold of Bitcoin price that you would suggest to your clients to turn off the machines?\n\nWebber: It depends on what difficulty does in response to spot price.\n\nIf Bitcoin [price] goes to a million [dollars], you might think miners are going to make a bunch of money. That\u2019s true for a little while. But competition will come in and you\u2019ll go back to making the same [amount] you\u2019re making today.\n\nIf Bitcoin goes down to US$10,000 or $5,000, it will force a lot of miners off that network because they\u2019re no longer profitable. They can\u2019t pay their power bills. So when they turn off, those who are surviving start making more and more Bitcoin. There\u2019s a balancing effect.\n\nIt matters what Bitcoin spot price does in the short term but over the long term, the network sort of self-adjusts. With the best energy sites or the lowest cost of production, you will outlast all of your competition and keep mining profitably even beyond that [Bitcoin] spot price decline.\n\nSo there is no magic number, there is no level at which this just becomes unfeasible. It\u2019s all about understanding the relationship between this flexibility \u2013 the uptime that you get versus the cost of your power versus the profitability of operating.\n\nA Digital Power Optimization project in the U.S. Image: DPO\n\nShen: Lots of miners struggled last year mainly due to low Bitcoin prices and high energy costs. Now Bitcoin is rising. How has the rising Bitcoin price affected the mining industry?\n\nWebber: There\u2019s some modest uptick in profitability, but it also changes the cost of the equipment.\n\nThe entry cost to participate in this market also changes because again, the equipment prices move as well as the profitability and the cost of energy. There are several different variables to determine how much money you can make. So it really hasn\u2019t changed that much in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI do think that Bitcoin trending upward slightly is a better market environment than Bitcoin trending downward quickly. There\u2019re investors that are coming back into the space. There\u2019s a little more comfort with people assuming it\u2019s not just going to go away tomorrow.\n\nMovement in Bitcoin spot price matters less to those miners that are doing this in an institutional way. If you buy equipment slowly over time, you don\u2019t really care that much about the fluctuations in Bitcoin spot price because the equipment is always sort of priced to reflect the current day\u2019s reality about future expectations.\n\nSo again, long story short, it does matter. It just doesn\u2019t matter as much as you might think.\n\nShen: How do you convince your clients to partner you? What are the opportunities and challenges the crypto mining industry faces at the moment, and why should the energy sector pay attention and get into Bitcoin mining?\n\nWebber: The regulatory overlay is a critical one, even more so than economic returns. The ability to soak up excess power at their generation sites is something that\u2019s really appealing to energy firms once we explain it to them.\n\nI think the lack of regulatory clarity has put a slowing, dampening effect on this space, especially here in the U.S. It is an attractive place to do it because there is a lot of excess power and we\u2019re putting up more renewable power every day and there\u2019s nowhere for it to go.\n\nThe regulatory component of all of this is the last real piece where these big energy companies, which are also heavily regulated in their own industry. Even outside of Bitcoin regulation, there\u2019s regulation in the power sector, which is very critical to these companies\u2019 operations, and they don\u2019t want to jeopardize their relationship with their energy regulators.\n\nWhat will happen over the next five or 10 years? I think more Bitcoin mining will be pushed onto green assets. I think it will be done by larger and larger institutions in a different sort of mindset than Bitcoin-first. It\u2019s going to be energy-first. The Bitcoin data center is just a tool that\u2019s used by the energy sector.\n\nShen: You\u2019ve said before on social media that Bitcoin mining could help with energy transition. Could you explain?\n\nWebber: I go to these energy conferences and there\u2019s an awareness among energy professionals that the energy transition from fossil fuels to green energy is extremely complicated. It\u2019s not just a matter of building more wind or building more solar.\n\nIf you can make renewable energy more profitable to build, then people will build more of it. If you can use flexible data centers as another strategy to make renewable energy assets more profitable by helping the developers and the owners deploy these data centers there, their profit margins go up, which means they can build more renewable energy assets. You operate them in a way that\u2019s more efficient and more productive by using every last electron that\u2019s created instead of just wasting it because there\u2019s nowhere for it to go.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge amount of curtailed energy where they literally turn off the solar farm or they turn off the wind farm because they have more power than they need and there\u2019s nowhere for it to go.\n\nOver the next decade, I believe that there will be more renewable energy created and driven by Bitcoin mining than people understand. I think it will be an important tool to really make renewable assets more viable than they otherwise would have been."

        "title": "Litecoin price poised for 700% gains vs. Bitcoin, says Charlie Lee - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Litecoin (LTC) can make some big gains versus Bitcoin (BTC), particularly as its August halving event gets closer, according to Litecoin\u2019s creator Charlie Lee.\n\nLitecoin up 85% since record lows versus Bitcoin\n\nLee argues that LTC/BTC could rally to 0.025 BTC, or over 700%, in the next bull cycle, with Litecoin having \u201chigher throughput by design, scalability with extension blocks, better fungibility and privacy from MWEB [MimbleWimble].\u201c\n\n\u201cI can see an upside target of 10% (0.025 LTC/BTC). In the next bull market, 5% (0.0125) shouldn\u2019t be too hard to achieve. I honestly don\u2019t see it going much below 1% (0.0025) on the downside. The next halving will be in ~92 days. This is going to be fun.\u201c\n\nHis statements appeared after Litecoin\u2019s 85% price recovery from its record low of 0.001716 BTC in June 2022. LTC is still down about 90% below its record high of 0.051 BTC from November 2013, owing to rising competition in the altcoin market.\n\nLTC/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nLitecoin halving looms\n\nLTC\u2019s recovery in recent months has been accompanied by growing buzz around its upcoming block reward halving.\n\nThe Litecoin block reward to miners will be cut by 50% from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC sometime in August 2023.\n\nAs a result, new LTC supply will drop by 50%, which should, at least in theory, make LTC more scarce on the market and, therefore, drive up its price.\n\nHistorically, the months leading to Litecoin halving typically prompted traders to accumulate LTC. For instance, the first halving event in August 2015 preceded a 450% price rally versus Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, the months before the second halving event saw limited gains as Bitcoin\u2019s crypto dominance grew amid the United States-China trade war. But, as a rule, LTC/BTC falls sharply after halving events, and the same could happen after August 2023.\n\nLTC price technicals hint at a similar scenario, with LTC/BTC printing what appears to be a bear flag pattern, as shown below.\n\nLTC/BTC three-day price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe pair may bounce toward the upper trendline of its bear flag, which coincided with the 50-3D exponential moving average (50-3D EMA; the red wave) near 0.0035 BTC ahead of the halving. But its bear flag target sits around 0.0024 BTC, down 20% from current price levels.\n\nLitecoin price to $100 by June?\n\nLitecoin has fared better versus the U.S. dollar in the months leading up to the last two halvings. LTC\u2019s price grew about 250% ahead of the first halving and 500% ahead of the second when measured from their sessional lows, respectively.\n\nLTC/USD monthly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has undergone a similar upside trajectory ahead of the August halving, with LTC up 120% from its sessional low of around $40. And it may continue to rise in the coming months, based on a mix of technical and on-chain indicators.\n\nFor instance, Litecoin is undervalued relative to its fair value, according to Glassnode\u2019s MVRV-Z score of -0.139.\n\nRelated: Why is Litecoin price up today?\n\nThe MVRV-Z score represents the ratio between the market and realized cap. When the market value is significantly higher than realized value, it historically indicates a market top (red zone). Meanwhile, the opposite indicates market bottoms (green zone), as shown below.\n\nLitecoin MVRV-Z score. Source: Glassnode\n\nLitecoin has entered the green zone, which typically precedes strong bullish reversals.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, LTC\u2019s price is well-positioned for a rebound after retesting its multimonth ascending trendline as support.\n\nLTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIn this case, LTC/USD can climb toward its horizontal resistance level near $100, up about 20% from current prices.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "The Fed has little ammo left as $30K Bitcoin price becomes key battle line - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Bitcoin price successfully defended the $28,000 support on May 2, but it has yet to prove the strength needed to reclaim the $29,200 level from April 30.\n\n$30K becomes crucial for Bitcoin bulls\n\nSome analysts will pin the recent downtrend on the expectation of an interest rate increase by the United States Federal Reserve on May 3, but in reality, the market is pricing 92% odds of a modest 25-basis-point increase to its highest level since September 2007.\n\n$DXY up/#Bitcoin down on yesterdays PMI data release.\n\n\n\nMarket is now pricing in a very high probability of 25bps raise at tomorrows #FOMC.\n\n\n\nThis is likely mostly priced in for BTC, but the comments afterwards (more rates/pause) will likely bring the volatility. https://t.co/H5qtGpd8gA pic.twitter.com/BmdsNRtb1f \u2014 Decentrader (@decentrader) May 2, 2023\n\nAs the market intelligence platform Decentrader pointed out, the comments from Fed chairman Jerome Powell are more likely to bring surprise elements, either pointing to further measures to slow down the economy or signaling higher odds of the terminal interest rate being close to 5%. Powell is set to hold a press conference at 2:30 pm Eastern Time.\n\nFrom an employment perspective, the central bank has reason to believe that the market continues to be overheated. The U.S. government reported 1.6 job openings for every unemployed worker in March. Moreover, according to the \u201cADP National Employment Report\u201d released on May 3, private payrolls increased by 296,000 jobs in April, well above the 148,000 market consensus.\n\nHowever, raising interest rates has negative consequences for families and small businesses in particular. Financing and mortgages become more costly, while investing in fixed income becomes more attractive. Such an undesired effect of curbing inflation could further shake the core of the financial system as shown by the latest bank failure, this time of First Republic Bank.\n\nTherefore, an eventual Bitcoin (BTC) price breakthrough above $30,000 could be a definitive sign of investors\u2019 perception shifting from seeing Bitcoin as a risk asset to a scarce digital asset that directly benefits from a weaker traditional banking system.\n\nBut to gauge whether Bitcoin\u2019s resilience above $28,000 is sustainable, an investor must analyze if excessive leverage has been used by buyers and whether professional traders are pricing higher odds of a market downturn using BTC derivatives.\n\nBitcoin futures show low demand from leverage buyers\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin two-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe data suggests Bitcoin traders have been extra cautious over the past couple of weeks. Even as the BTC price flirted with $30,000 on April 26, there were no signs of demand for leveraged longs.\n\nRelated: Balaji pays out his crazy $1M Bitcoin bet, 97% under price target\n\nMoreover, the Bitcoin futures premium has stagnated near 2% since April 23, suggesting that buyers are unwilling to use leverage, which is healthy for the market. By avoiding futures contract exposure, it greatly reduces the risk of large liquidations during negative Bitcoin price moves.\n\nBitcoin options traders remain neutral\n\nThe Bitcoin options market can also help a trader understand whether a recent correction has caused investors to become more optimistic. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe option delta's 25% skew has shown balanced demand between call and put options for the past four weeks. That should come as a surprise given that the Bitcoin price rallied 10% between April 25 and April 30, when it last tested the $30,000 resistance.\n\nConsequently, Bitcoin options and futures markets suggest that professional traders are not placing their chips on the BTC price breaking above $30,000 anytime soon. On the other hand, those whales are pricing in similar odds of surprise positive and negative moves.\n\nUltimately, given that the Fed clearly has a limit to raising interest rates without causing a recession, Bitcoin\u2019s price should be positively impacted, regardless of the decision on May 3.\n\nFed chair Powell will ultimately force the U.S. Treasury to inject more money into the economy to contain the banking crisis, which will be beneficial for a scarce asset such as Bitcoin.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Over the last few months, a new development came to the Bitcoin network: Inscriptions. Dubbed Ordinals, these digital assets differ from their NFT counterparts, but the results are the same. Since its inception, the Bitcoin network has seen a massive spike in traffic, not unlike what Ethereum underwent during the 2021 NFT boom.\n\n\n\nThis increased activity has led to congestion on an already crowded network \u2014 sparking a heated debate about the potential impact of Ordinals on the future of Bitcoin. It also begs the question: Now the genie is out of the bottle, what\u2019s next? And, perhaps more importantly, how will the Bitcoin network cope with the on-chain strain?\n\nWhat are Ordinals?\n\nAt a high level, the Ordinals protocol enables users to send and receive Satoshis \u2014 the smallest monetary unit of a Bitcoin, or \u200b\u200bone-hundred-millionths of one BTC \u2014 that carry extra data connected to them.

Adding data to a Satoshi is called an \u201cinscription,\u201d which is not dissimilar to NFTs.\n\nThis was all made possible with some significant upgrades to the network that have occurred. First was the SegWit update, which created a split data structure for all transactions. The second was Taproot, which allowed more data to be placed within transactions.\n\nUnlike most NFTs on Ethereum, which usually just include a link to the media, Bitcoin Ordinals are 100% on-chain. This is a major selling point for digital assets, but it also means these digital collectibles are expensive to create and that the transactions that do so tend to be rather large. Because of this, it has made some wary about the consequences of this protocol on the network as a whole.\n\nOrdinals have only been around for a few months, and over 3.2 million new assets have already been created in that short time. The Bitcoin network has also subsequently seen one of the largest blocks ever mined, 4 megabytes, as a direct result of Ordinal inscribing. Then there is the considerable impact these new types of NFTs have on network congestion and transaction fees, which have hit levels not seen since November 2022. This rise in transaction volume and average fees has also led to miners excluding many lower-fee transactions, raising the floor price for transacting on the network.\n\nA community divided\n\nA debate is currently raging about whether these Ordinals are good for Bitcoin. For one, some have pointed out that Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, didn\u2019t think Bitcoin should be used for anything other than the transaction of value. There\u2019s also a concern that continued adoption could further clog up the network and make it even more expensive. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that this development could harm the ability of marginalized people to use Bitcoin. Considering that many developing nations are the most prolific users of the network, this could potentially affect some jurisdictions more than others.\n\nOn the other side of the debate, many feel the panic over Bitcoin Ordinals is largely unwarranted. For one, the transaction-purging mentioned before only affects the lowest fee transactions, encouraging fee competition. Additionally, while inscriptions have taken up a considerable amount of every block as of late, not long ago, most blocks were 25% to 50% empty. Arguably, Ordinals are just using resources that otherwise would be wasted.\n\nIndeed, some schools of thought suggest adding value and utility to the Bitcoin network is essential for the network\u2019s longevity. For one, increasing the adoption of Bitcoin is vital for its legitimacy as a currency and store of value. The more people use it, the more valuable it becomes and the more stable its value can be.\n\nCombating congestion\n\nHowever, the congestion issue still persists. Now that Ordinals have opened the Bitcoin network to new possibilities, where does it end? Arguably, a solution needs to be found. The most likely solution is some form of layer-2 infrastructure that can take the bulk of transaction processing away from the main chain. This could allow Ordinals to proliferate on the Bitcoin network without threatening transactional use cases.\n\nOne potential solution in the long term is creating a ZK-rollup on BTC, storing proofs on Bitcoin where Ordinal images are stored. This would allow increased throughput without compromising on security. This would require a change to BTC to verify the proofs, which could take years.\n\nAnother potential solution is using side chains or layer-2 solutions. For example, the Bitcoin Lightning Network has proven to handle transactions quickly and cost-effectively. Alternatively, there\u2019s the Liquid Network, which similarly acts as a means to take traffic off the main network to allow for faster, cheaper trades.\n\nThe previously mentioned solutions would all increase the throughput of BTC, but still would not provide a smart contract layer to BTC. In addition, ideally, this should be done without invoking any risky technology like centralized bridges, which lost users almost US$3 billion last year. Recent developments allow the network to act as a smart contract layer for BTC while mitigating the potential risks of centralized cross-chain bridges and poorly designed wrapped tokens. Allowing Bitcoin to become programmable can also unlock a wide range of new DeFi-related use cases, including Bitcoin or Ordinal collateralized loans and staking.\n\nThe rise of Ordinals on the Bitcoin network is undeniable, and their impact is only set to grow in the coming years as more projects tap into the same utility. But it\u2019s clear that the current state of the network is not equipped to handle the influx of traffic that this may bring, and it\u2019s time to face the reality that Bitcoin needs to evolve to keep up. Turning to layer-2 infrastructure may be a critical part of the solution."

The notice gives the recipient the opportunity to respond to the allegations made by the agency and explain why they believe enforcement action is not warranted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Coinbase\u2019s case, the Wells Notice alleged that the company's staking products constitute unregistered securities, while also mentioning several other aspects of the exchange\u2019s activities, including the Coinbase Wallet.\n\nIn response to the SEC\u2019s Wells Notice, Coinbase stated it does not list securities, its Coinbase Wallet product does not constitute a broker, and the exchange\u2019s staking services have nothing to do with a securities offering.\n\nLast week, the San Francisco-based exchange also revealed that it was suing the SEC over its \u201cpetition for rulemaking\u201d that was sent to the regulator last July and still remains unanswered. The legal action aims to get the agency to respond to Coinbase\u2019s plea for clearer crypto regulations.\n\nIn a separate development earlier this week, Coinbase has launched a new international exchange that will initially offer Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures, with trades settled in USD Coin (USDC)."

        "title": "Does the next Bitcoin halving suggest an incoming bull run? - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "The last bull cycle, when Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $70,000, seems like a long time ago. Since the second half of 2021, several flash crashes and company closures have played a part in dragging Bitcoin\u2019s value on the charts. Nonetheless, a recovery effort in 2023 has raised hopes about Bitcoin\u2019s future prospects once again.\n\nAs the upcoming halving event scheduled for April 2024 draws closer, several analysts expect the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency could embark on its next bull run and touch earlier highs.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin halving?\n\nAs you may know, a variety of factors affect Bitcoin\u2019s price. One of them is the halving event, which takes place once every four years. As the name suggests, Bitcoin halving is an event in which the reward for Bitcoin miners is cut by half.\n\nHalving effectively reduces the rate at which new coins are created, thus lowering the supply of bitcoins in the market. A quick note here is that miners validate transactions and add data to the public ledger, for which they are awarded newly created Bitcoins.\n\nThe last halving occurred in May 2020, in which rewards for validating a block were cut to 6.25 BTC from 12.50 BTC. Currently, around 19 million Bitcoins are in circulation out of the total 21 million that can ever be created. Following the next halving, rewards for Bitcoin miners will be slashed to 3.125 BTC.\n\nTheoretically, as supply declines and demand rises and the price of Bitcoin should rise over time. In the backdrop of slumping crypto prices last year, Du Jun, Co-Founder of Huobi, told CNBC that Bitcoin might get to see its bull run only in 2024 or 2025 following the halving event.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamie Sly, an analyst at the educational platform CryptoCompare, told CNBC that investors tend to accumulate Bitcoin in the run-up to the halving event. He also said that the accumulation period from the market bottom after the breakout to the halving date has historically spanned at least 500 days.\n\nMore recently, Bitcoin bull Tim Draper also said that the halving would have a positive effect on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nAlso read: A guide on how to bridge from Solana to Ethereum\n\nJudging by historical performances, the last couple of halving events have been followed by a bullish Bitcoin. After the last halving took place in May 2020, Bitcoin\u2019s price rallied by 622 percent leading up to April 2021.\n\nIts price jumped from around $9,000 on May 13, 2020, to a then all-time high of $65,000 by April 14, 2021. Similarly, the halving event which took place before that in July 2016 saw Bitcoin jump by 2,824 percent to $19,000 by mid-December 2017.\n\nSpeaking to Kitco News in July 2022, Florian Grummes, the managing director of investment advisory firm Midas Touch Consulting, said that Bitcoin\u2019s next rally would likely occur six to 12 months ahead of the Bitcoin halving.\n\nAt the time, Bitcoin\u2019s price was trading around $23,000 after witnessing several corrections since its November 2021 all-time high of $70,000.\n\nThe present scenario\n\nSince the start of 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s price has risen by over 70 percent from its December 2022 close of $16,600. At the time of writing, it hovered around the $29,200 mark after rising by as much as 5.6 percent in the last three days.\n\nMany in the community believe the market is showing signs of recovery, underpinned by fundamental growth and other factors such as the US banking crisis and soaring worldwide inflation.\n\nNonetheless, not all is rosy for Bitcoin, as some analysts remain bearish on the asset. Mark Mobius, a well-known fund manager, predicted in May that the king coin would fall to $10,000 by 2023-end as higher interest rates make buying or holding Bitcoin less attractive since the coin does not return any interest.\n\nEarlier in December 2022, financial institution Standard Chartered made even bolder predictions by saying that Bitcoin could decline to $5,000 by 2023-end. An analyst said that an increase in crypto bankruptcies would damage investor confidence in the digital asset industry.\n\nThe prediction was made after the FTX collapse cascaded to other cryptocurrency-related businesses in the sector.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price is showing some positives leading up to the next halving event scheduled for April 2024. However, there are a few other factors to consider here. Speaking to Blockworks, Lex Sokolin, chief crypto economics officer at ConsenSys, revealed that investors are currently risk-averse amid possibilities of a looming recession.\n\nThe same could make it difficult for investors to pour money into cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhatever the situation, calls for the next Bitcoin bull run will only become more obvious once macro factors have a chance to take their course in the coming months.\n\nAlso read: What will happen to cryptocurrencies if the US economy crumbles"

        "content": "The best advice you can get when buying bitcoin or investing in crypto (other than, you know, \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d) is the same advice you get when going to a casino: never bet more than you\u2019re willing to lose. Balaji Srinivasan, the former chief technical officer of Coinbase, must have been more than willing to part ways with fat stacks after he gave up on hopes bitcoin would ever reach prices equal to $1 million.\n\nCrypto Exchanges Restrict Withdrawals CC Share Subtitles Off\n\nEnglish view video Crypto Exchanges Restrict Withdrawals\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a trader, I\u2019m not John McAfee, and I\u2019m not in the bait of publicly burning a million bucks,\u201d Srinivasan wrote in a Tuesday tweet. Unfortunately, that\u2019s what he did, and more than a month earlier than he stated he originally intended to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSrinivasan, a former partner at venture capital kingmakers Andreesen Horowitz, made a public bet back in March that bitcoin would reach $1 million in value. His named his gamble shortly after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, predicting the economy would go bankrupt along with hyperinflation of the U.S. dollar, all of which would see the price of bitcoin skyrocket. Srinivasan originally predicted it would take 90 days for the value of bitcoin to balloon while the entire U.S. economy flatlined, though he later told CoinDesk it could take \u201c900 days or even 90 months\u2026 I don\u2019t have a 100% probability on it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis attempt to short the entire U.S. economy didn\u2019t exactly pan out, and he called his own bluff late on Tuesday. He said he donated $1.5 million in total, which amounted to $500,000 to three entities including the East African direct money nonprofit GiveDirectly, bitcoin node developers Bitcoin Core, and the Twitter user James Medlock. The account previously made its own $1 million bet that the economy would not enter hyperinflation, though the user admitted Tuesday that they made the tweet as a kind of joke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Srinivasan continued to claim that there was \u201csomething wrong with the economy, and the state isn\u2019t telling you about it.\u201d\n\nHis video explaining his reasoning is more like a hungover person trying to explain why they tried to drunkenly consume their friend\u2019s house plant than any cogent argument about the state of the economy. He referred to the run-ups of economic calamities of yesteryear, like the months before the start of the 2008 financial crisis and the start of the covid pandemic in 2020, for why he chose his few-month time frame. Then he cited a morass of articles pointing to economic fears of an incoming bond and banking crisis. He rambled on, citing the well-known prognosticator Elon Musk and the waning numbers of millionaires coming to the U.S. as signs of economic worry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a crystal ball,\u201d he said, and then claimed there\u2019s a 10% chance we\u2019d see an economic crisis in \u201cmonths.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a small thing\u2026 it\u2019s not like the banking crisis is over,\u201d Srinivasan said, referring to the SVB collapse. That bank was one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history, though that hasn\u2019t stopped his former bosses at Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, signing back on to the restored bank. Don\u2019t forget that part of the reason for SVB\u2019s immediate collapse was a bank run of startup founders and venture firms, many backed by a16z. The venture capital firm had reportedly messaged many of its startups telling them to get their funds out, decimating the bank in a number of hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget where the price of bitcoin currently stands. The price of bitcoin saw highs of above $60,000 briefly in late 2021 before crashing precipitously over the course of the following year. According to CoinM arketC ap, the price currently sits below $30,000. If he truly thought the price of bitcoin would bounce $970,000 in price in just a few-months time frame, he would also have to confront the fact that bitcoin is only rarely used as a currency, and acts more as a volatile speculation that rarely leads to any sort of profit for base users."

        "content": "Aleksandar Matanovi\u0107 was perplexed but unphased when Serbia\u2019s crypto market unexpectedly hit the media spotlight after it was revealed crypto fugitive Do Kwon was hiding out in the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had so many crypto scandals since Luna, if he\u2019d come to Serbia straight after the collapse the attention would have been much worse,\u201d he told DL News.\n\nKwon, the former Terraform Labs CEO, was the subject of an international manhunt following the $60 billion collapse of Terra/Luna in May 2022. He was arrested in Montenegro in March.\n\nNOW READ: Six month manhunt for Terra co-founder Do Kwon ends with arrest in Montenegro\n\nSince Matanovi\u0107\u2019s first foray into digital assets in the late \u201890s to get around wartime sanctions, the 43-year-old CEO of ECD, Serbia\u2019s longest-running crypto exchange, has weathered several storms. For him, the Do Kwon hoopla is nothing more than a distraction as he builds the crypto business he founded more than 10 years ago.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nHis attraction to crypto echoes the stories of entrepreneurs in countries like Lebanon, Venezuela and Argentina today.\n\nWhile ECD is still small fry compared to international giants \u2014 Coinbase had a 2022 total revenue of almost $3.2 billion \u2014 Matanovi\u0107 is fighting to grow his customer base and spread the Bitcoin gospel.\n\nFrom creating an exchange for Bitcoin precursor e-gold just two years before it was banned to selling thousands of Bitcoins for five bucks, Matanovi\u0107 has successfully navigated several bear markets and solidified his position as a veteran in the space.\n\nECD now boasts 50,000 users and an annual revenue of \u20ac30 million in 2022, up from \u20ac10 million in 2021 and \u20ac1 million in 2020. Matanovi\u0107 says the numbers were flattered by a tweak in the law in mid-2021 where the whole transaction was counted instead of trading fees.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u2018We are in an absurd situation where it is easier for people from Serbia to onboard on Binance on Kraken or some other foreign exchange than it is to onboard on Serbian exchange and that shouldn\u2019t be the case\u2019\n\nThe exchange has seen a small but noticeable uptick in Russian users. More than 23,000 Russians have been granted residency in the country alongside a much smaller proportion of Ukrainians since Vladmir Putin\u2019s troops invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nIn addition, more than 263,000 Russians entered Serbia alone in 2022, according to Ministry of Internal Affairs numbers reported by BBC Serbia.\n\nNOW READ: Pro-Russian neo-Nazis\u2019 Telegram campaigns raise $5m in crypto \u2013 but it\u2019s \u2018significantly harder\u2019\n\nUnlike the majority of Europe, Serbia has not imposed sanctions on Russia. It has even signed new gas deals since the invasion. Analysts note that the state-controlled Air Serbia airline has doubled its flights from Belgrade to Moscow, a sentiment that runs directly counter to the EU.\n\nOf these new arrivals, approximately 300 Russians have signed up to ECD and are chiefly users of the company\u2019s ATMs, where they can register to withdraw their crypto without needing a Serbian bank account, allowing quick access to funds, according to Matanovi\u0107.\n\nRussian customers\u2019 use of the ATMs are just an incidental drop in the bucket of the entrepreneur\u2019s total business volumes, according to Matanovi\u0107, but cast a curious light on how the country\u2019s new regulations on crypto are impacting the exchange.\n\nFrom e-gold to Bitcoin\n\nTall, slim and self-assured, Matanovi\u0107 is every inch the Bitcoin believer.\n\n\u201cI wish we had Bitcoin in the \u201890s,\u201d he told DL News. \u201cIt would have made our life much easier. Because as usual, politicians make a mess and then regular people suffer and it would be good for them to have the way around the regular financial system wherever they are,\u201d\n\nFrustrated with not being able to take full advantage of the internet revolution, Matanovi\u0107 discovered crypto precursor e-gold the early digital currency started in the US backed by gold \u2014 as a way to get access to a nascent e-commerce market \u2014 one that had been blocked to him due to sanctions.\n\n\u201cI recognised the value at first glance, because I knew the pain I had to go through for being from Serbia,\u201d he said. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many things you could buy, but I was hoping that would change with time.\u201d\n\nWith timing not on his side, Matanovi\u0107 started an e-gold exchange in 2007, just two years before being forced to shutter the platform after the asset was banned. Undeterred, the arrival of Bitcoin piqued his interest.\n\n\u2018I recognised the value at first glance, because I knew the pain I had to go through for being from Serbia\u2019\n\nArmed with only a few computers, he began an early Bitcoin mining operation after a suggestion from Nikola Cvijovi\u0107, his business partner and co-founder of ECD.\n\n\u201cI thought he was crazy. I was very sceptical. It was a small mining operation, just a few computers in a garage,\u201d he said. But it didn\u2019t take long for electricity bills to outweigh the profit.\n\nAnd like so many entrepreneurs, the exchange business was created to solve a problem.\n\n\u201cThere were very few Bitcoin exchanges globally. It was impossible to get money from those exchanges to Serbia regularly,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people opened bank accounts in Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, and then physically going there to bring it into Serbia, but it was not the perfect way.\u201d\n\nNOW READ: Lebanon\u2019s crypto brokers dodge turmoil and masked gunmen to serve clients\n\nBut it took years for the industry to be recognised officially \u2014 licences to trade crypto were only doled out last year following Serbia\u2019s new Digital Assets Law.\n\nOn the one hand, Matanovi\u0107 maintains the legislation has strengthened the business \u2014 accountants that were previously spooked by crypto have been assuaged.\n\nBut retail customers were drawn towards offshore exchanges.\n\n\u201cOnce the law was introduced, the legal entities felt much more comfortable in working with crypto. And that\u2019s the segment of the market that really has become much stronger,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere was a perception among the people that crypto is tax free, because most of the people didn\u2019t know how to report the tax,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Matanovi\u0107 is pushing for more efficiencies, citing Serbian know-your-customer, or KYC, procedures as outdated. Customer verification has to be done in person and is the biggest obstacle for his online business.\n\nAnti-money laundering laws hit Serbian crypto transactions in 2018, and significantly impacted the company\u2019s ATM transactions by raising the bar for KYC checks \u2014 causing a real disadvantage compared to exchanges abroad.\n\n\u201cWe are in an absurd situation where it is easier for people from Serbia to onboard on Binance on Kraken or some other foreign exchange than it is to onboard on Serbian exchange, and that shouldn\u2019t be the case,\u201d he said.\n\nBut while regulation has been broadly welcomed by local crypto analysts, Matanovi\u0107 almost shudders at the mention of the possibility a Serbian issued central bank currency CBDC.\n\n\u201cI will try to sabotage it,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it never happens because I see huge potential for abuse\u2026 As a true crypto fan, what I would like to see is at some point is a total separation of money and state and not a tighter connection between them.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin Ordinals have recently taken the crypto industry by storm, with registrations surging to an all-time high of 3.4 million last week. This explosion of interest in the protocol is exciting news for the NFT market and suggests that the crypto industry is becoming more interested in NFTs and their applications beyond Ethereum.\n\nOrdinals Protocol allows users to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions. Despite the skyrocketing fees, the surge in daily enrollments began on April 21st and peaked on May 1st, with over 372,000 enrollments in just 24 hours. This surge in registrations contributed to an all-time high in daily BTC transactions on May 1st, reaching 682,281.\n\nAlthough most registrations for the protocol are text-based, followed by applications and JPEG images, the surge in enrollments is significant for the industry. Bitcoin Ordinals NFT is compliant with the BRC-20 standard \u2013 Bitcoin Request for Comment number 20 \u2013 which was introduced last March, enabling new tokens to be minted on the BTC network.\n\nI can't believe my eyes BRC-20 demand leading to a 700% increase in fees AFTER what we've seen with Ordinal Inscriptions 12,800% increase in fees from BEFORE Ordinal Inscriptions launched 300,000 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool pic.twitter.com/oyLceu6ODe \u2014 trevor.btc @ NYC (@TO) May 2, 2023\n\nWhat\u2019s also interesting is that BTC maximalists used to be very opposed to ordinals, but appear to be coming around. The surge in registrations may be evidence that Bitcoin Ordinals NFT is becoming more accepted among BTC maximalists as they realize the potential for NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe explosion in numbers and daily enrollments is exciting news for the crypto industry and suggests that there is a growing demand for NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. With the surge in interest in Bitcoin Ordinals NFT, we can expect to see more innovation and growth in the NFT market.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals NFTs are not only contributing to the growth of the NFT market but also to the overall Bitcoin network by incentivizing miners, prioritizing valuable transactions, and enhancing network security. While the high fees may put a higher price tag on transactions on the network, proponents of Ordinals believe that the benefits outweigh the costs and that it opens up new use cases for Bitcoin, bringing in liquidity, new users, and developers, ultimately making Bitcoin more valuable through better user experience and more use cases."

        "content": "In my quest to get inspiration from non-Bitcoin thinkers in the business world, I recently read The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell. My goal is to see what ideas I may be overlooking as a Bitcoin-focused entrepreneur, writer, and accidental influencer. The book is a fascinating exploration of how ideas, products, and social behaviors spread like epidemics. While I love Gladwell\u2019s writing style, the book seemed almost painfully obvious in the points it was making, but it might be because his book worked as a template for formatting digital virality in the information age, and I am, myself, a product of the world created by this seminal work from about twenty years ago.\n\nGladwell identifies three key factors that contribute to the tipping point:\n\nThe Law of the Few: the impact of influencers. The Stickiness Factor: the impact of messaging and product desire on the market. The Power of Context: the impact of time and place or \u201cluck.\u201d\n\nBy understanding these principles, Gladwell predicted wisely that one could better predict and influence the factors that cause ideas and trends to go viral.\n\nMy thoughts on application to Bitcoin\n\nAs with any epidemic, Bitcoin has reached its tipping point, but not by solving real-world problems such as cross-border remittance, online paywalls, or login authorizations with any significant frequency. Instead, it spent over a decade in protocol and governance debate and morphed into a speculative bubble. We stand to lose the very essence of this ingenious creation if we don\u2019t address the issues that matter.\n\nThe Law of the Few: Bitcoin\u2019s initial adopters, innovators, and tech-savvy enthusiasts have been instrumental in introducing it to the masses. But as bitcoin gained popularity, a new group of influencers emerged: the crypto bros, the rent-seekers, and the speculators. These individuals, driven by the allure of quick profits or cushy consulting positions, have transformed the perception of Bitcoin into a speculative investment, causing drastic price swings and detaching it from its initial purpose. We need the visionaries and entrepreneurs to return to the forefront if we are ever to harness the true potential of Bitcoin. There is an opportunity here to encourage the creation of truly disruptive business.\n\nThe Stickiness Factor: Bitcoin\u2019s stickiness lies in its distributed nature, its cryptographic usefulness, competitive security model, provability of otherwise complex data, and its ability to bypass many inefficient systems. But are these features being fully utilized? Not yet. To ensure Bitcoin\u2019s longevity, entrepreneurs must tap into these attributes and build businesses that leverage the power of the blockchain. By creating solutions for cross-border remittance, online paywalls, and login authorizations, we can anchor Bitcoin\u2019s value in its utility, not just in the whims of the market. Another principle for determining if something is a Bitcoin opportunity is to ask \u201cdo I need to reduce payment friction or increase data integrity?\u201d If the answer is yes, you might have something sticky for Bitcoin.\n\nThe Power of Context: Bitcoin emerged amid the financial crisis of 2008, which eroded trust in centralized institutions, and people presumed it was a response to malpractice by the banks and the state. That defined much of the first half of Bitcoin\u2019s life, and it still informs a lot of the messaging for the \u201cstore of value\u201d people.\n\nToday, the context has shifted. The world is moving towards a borderless digital economy, and the need for more efficient and inclusive financial systems is growing. The factions of bitcoiners have split from each other, and the experiments in boundless payments, trade, identity, and tokenization continue to rage. The time has never been more ripe for businesses to use Bitcoin as a tool to revolutionize the way we transact and interact online.\n\nPrinciples and thoughts\n\nImagine a world where cross-border remittances are instant, cost-effective, and secure. Migrant workers could send money to their families without losing a significant portion to exorbitant fees, thus improving their living conditions and providing a lifeline to developing economies. Bitcoin-based businesses could create platforms that make this vision a reality, enhancing financial inclusion and reducing global inequality.\n\nEnvision a digital landscape where online paywalls no longer hamper access to knowledge and content. Instead, micropayments in Bitcoin could facilitate a fair exchange between creators and consumers. Such a system would encourage the production of high-quality content while ensuring that consumers only pay for what they truly value.\n\nConsider a digital world with a single, secure login authorization that grants access to all online services without the need to remember countless passwords or expose personal information. Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology could be the foundation for this revolutionary system, providing a secure, decentralized, and user-friendly authentication process.\n\nHow about tokenizing all assets so they can be more easily valued and traded?\n\nIt is time to shift the conversation from speculation to innovation. Let us not squander the potential of Bitcoin by confining it to the volatile world of market speculation. The power of Bitcoin lies in its ability to reshape the financial landscape, and we must nurture businesses that will turn this potential into reality. We must move beyond the tipping point and bring about a new era of technological and financial revolution.\n\nI am very excited about the Ordinals colored coin protocol that exploded into the bitcoin consciousness this year. It could very well be a uniting factor that brings together value creators on all UTXO chains to share and value real assets globally! But so far, speculation on memecoins and JPEGs has ruled the day. While it\u2019s great to make easy money shockingly fast, we need to be thinking harder about value creation too!\n\nA call to action\n\nLet us rally around the entrepreneurs who dare to challenge the status quo and build businesses that harness the true power of Bitcoin. And let us not forget the promise of a distributed financial future, where barriers are broken, opportunities are equalized, and trust is restored. By embracing this vision and taking decisive action, we can turn the fourteen-year long speculative bubble of Bitcoin into a transformative force that reshapes the world for the better.\n\nSo let us embark on this journey together, driven by the spirit of innovation and the conviction that Bitcoin is more than just a speculative asset\u2014it is the catalyst for change that we\u2019ve been waiting for. We just have to be bold enough to stop waiting.\n\nWhat are some other books I should read to understand virality, the business cycle, and economics, so I can learn more ways to think about bitcoin in their context?\n\nWatch: Kurt answers the viewers most urgent Blockchain and Bitcoin Questions\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "content": "Image: Shutterstock\n\nTo \"optimize innovation and enhance the scale of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem,\" the San Francisco-based startup wants to make Bitcoin mining technology \"open source\" wherever possible by selling standalone ASICs and other hardware components. The post claims that the steps taken over the past few months will allow the company to experiment with new designs and aid in delivering more efficient and inexpensive Bitcoin mining chips to the market.\n\nFormer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's financial services and technology firm, Block, has announced that the prototype design of their new five-nanometer (5nm) Bitcoin (BTC) mining chip is complete. Block claims that this chip is necessary for decentralizing the supply of Bitcoin mining rigs. In a blog post dated April 28th, Block outlined the technical and financial difficulties of creating Bitcoin mining ASIC machines. This has led to what has been called \"the excessive concentration of specialized Bitcoin mining silicon\" within a small number of firms. Block claims that the resulting centralization is detrimental to Bitcoin's decentralized nature.In order to expedite this development drive, Block has acquired a large quantity of ASIC processors from Intel. Intel announced on April 18 that, as part of cost-cutting measures, the company would no longer ship or accept orders for Blockscale 1000 Series ASICs beyond April 2024. According to Block, this enormous influx of ASICs from Intel will expedite the creation of its 3nm processor, which will be the most advanced semiconductor to date upon release.The width of two silicon atoms is approximately similar to one nanometer (1nm). As chip components shrink, it becomes possible to fit more transistors onto a silicon die of the same size. By lowering the overall size, the electric current in the circuit must travel a shorter distance to make a calculation, resulting in an increase in overall efficiency and a decrease in the quantity of heat generated.Notably, 5 nanometer ASIC chips have existed for quite a while now, with the earliest known 5nm ASIC released in 2021 by the Chinese mining company Canaan. Currently, most Bitcoin mining ASICs utilize 5nm circuits, although no company has released the source code for their ASIC chip designs."

        "title": "The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan confirms it's been mining Bitcoin for years - ZME Science",
        "content": "Facebook\n\nX\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nA town in Bhutan. Image credits: Pema Gyamtsho.\n\nWhen you read about Bhutan in the news, it\u2019s usually something to do with the environment or some progressive policies. Bhutan is famously the only carbon-negative country in the world \u2014 its lush forests sequester more greenhouse gas emissions than the country produces. It\u2019s also one of the countries most committed to environmental conservation, which the country considers one of the key pillars of \u201cGross National Happiness\u201d \u2014 an innovative index Bhutan uses to measure how well-off its citizens are. Bhutan also has remarkably vaccinated around 90% of its citizens against COVID-19 in a week.\n\nThis time, the country is involved in a different type of operation. Bhutan, whose population numbers just under 800,000 people, has been steadily investing in various ambitious projects. But this one is different.\n\nBhutan bullish on Bitcoin\n\nThe tiny kingdom of Bhutan has little natural resources, but it does have immense hydroelectricity potential. Hydroelectric plants have become a major driver of the country\u2019s economy, accounting for around a third of the country\u2019s GDP. In addition to powering the entire country, this hydroelectricity also nabs Bhutan a bit of profit.\n\nBhutan exports over 75% of its electricity (most of it to India). But for the past few years, the country\u2019s royal government has been stealthily devising a new way to generate income from this water: using it to mine Bitcoin. Forbes reports that for the first time, the government confirmed that it was using this electricity to mine crypto, with mining starting \u201ca few years ago as one of the early entrants when the price of Bitcoin was around USD 5,000.\u201d\n\nMining Bitcoin is a very energy-intensive process. According to some estimates, the emissions of Bitcoin are comparable to those of a small or medium-sized country. But if you have a steady supply of clean energy, it\u2019s a different matter. In addition, Bhutan\u2019s high mountains provide excellent air-conditioned places to set up digital asset mining operations which otherwise would consume a lot of power for air conditioning in warmer places.\n\nBhutan reportedly developed this plan in an attempt to generate positive, sustainable returns across a range of asset classes, including crypto. Speaking to local newspaper The Bhutanese, a government official said they\u2019re mining bitcoin in a bid to offset costs and environmental harms.\n\nBhutan is usually known for its rich culture and mountainous landscape. But now, the country wants to take a dive into crypto. Image credits: Aaron Santelices.\n\nA mysterious operation\n\nA representative from Druk Holding and Investments (DHI) said the first priority is Bhutan\u2019s energy requirements, so mining is slowed down or stopped when energy runs low. DHI is Bhutan\u2019s commercial and investment arm of the Royal Government. Nevertheless, the official said that this is a way for the country to diversify its income and establish itself as a player in the rapidly evolving technology landscape.\n\n\u201cWe are fostering relevant human capital for industries of the future, ensuring our citizens are equipped to participate in the modern global economy from within Bhutan. For example, DHI\u2019s investment in building the world\u2019s first Self-Sovereign National Digital Identity platform, which was designed and built locally, represents a significant step in the country\u2019s ongoing digital transformation. Such investments will ensure Bhutan is at the forefront of global innovation,\u201d said DHI.\n\n\u201cOur portfolio contains investments across a range of asset classes that deliver exposure to traditional sectors and the industries driving the modern economy. This includes global equities, fixed income and venture capital investments in promising startups; domestic and international real estate; renewable energy including hydropower generation; healthtech, biotech, life sciences and agritech; and digital asset mining and investment,\u201d said a statement from DHI.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear when exactly the mining began and how profitable it is. The official said the project \u201cpays for itself\u201d, but that\u2019s relatively vague. Perhaps even more imrpotantly, it\u2019s unclear why Bhutan hid the project from its citizens and international partners.\n\nThis is all the more curious as Bhutan is in negotiations with Bitdeer. Bitdeer is a company founded by Chinese billionaire Wu Jihan. However, Bitdeer is listed on the American Nasdaq stock exchange. The company reportedly wants to secure energy for a data center in Bhutan, but this deal is shrouded in secrecy for now.\n\nSustainability and cryptocurrency\n\nBhutan is without a doubt one of the more interesting countries on the planet. A traditional society in a landlocked, mountainous country that embraced technology and progressive measures makes for a pretty unique mixture. But the country\u2019s demographics are in a precarious situation.\n\nEmigration is a big problem for Bhutan, particularly to (believe it or not) Australia. The two countries have thriving diplomatic relations, but Bhutan is seeing many of its educated people leaving the country.\n\nGranted, Bhutan is trying to improve the conditions. It\u2019s tried everything from agriculture and tourism to mines to achieve self-sufficiency. However, with its geography and limited resources, it\u2019s difficult for Bhutan to develop its own successful path. Focusing on environmental protection is a good place to start building a national identity. Can hi-tech elements like crypto mining be the missing puzzle piece?\n\nThe country\u2019s government seems to believe so. Over 10% of the country\u2019s budget in 2022 was invested in computer chips, so they\u2019re betting significantly on this. Mining is definitely a costly and risky endeavor in itself. But with a lot of hydropower on standby, Bhutan could get a chance to exploit this niche and establish itself as a major player in the Bitcoin game.\n\n\u201cThis maybe the first bold effort or experiment of its kind where a Least Developed Country with major developmental disadvantages aims to leap frog into the future using the fourth industrial revolution,\u201d Tenzing Lamsang concludes for The Bhutanese.\n\nWas this helpful? Thanks for your feedback!"

Payments with bitcoin no longer need a central counterparty \u2013 money can be sent directly from buyer to seller. This is different with regular money transfers where payments go through a third party, often a bank.\n\n\u201cI was extremely sceptical\u201d\n\nSo will bitcoin prevail as a new currency?

Later, when studying economics, he started to delve into cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cI was extremely sceptical at first,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the more I looked at cryptocurrencies, the more fascinated I became.\u201d To Sch\u00e4r, bitcoin is an important innovation. \u201cThe system is incredibly well thought out.\u201d But he also warns of risks: \u201cLarge fluctuations in value are a problem.\u201d Sch\u00e4r recommends investing in self-education and a better understanding of cryptocurrencies before trading.\n\nSch\u00e4r puts his advice into practice in his role as a professor specializing in cryptocurrencies. He can exchange ideas with many interesting people from the political and private sectors.\n\nHis research covers the future role of the financial infrastructure and the changing role of intermediaries, such as banks.

No need to send in the canary as you won\u2019t need to become an actual miner to stack up some crypto rewards and free bitcoin in these seven ways:\n\n1. Airdrops\n\nMany crypto businesses give away an initial coin offering or a set number of tokens. These can be earned when you perform certain actions or meet specific requirements. Airdrops are the free distribution of these bitcoins or other cryptocurrency tokens. Simply put, it is a marketing tool that crypto companies use to entice you to sign up for the company\u2019s platform. When you satisfy the set requirements, you get a portion of that company\u2019s crypto shared with you, thus letting you earn free crypto.\n\n2. Bounty\n\nIt should be noted that bounties are more specific for those who work with a crypto company. But it is good to know that you can get free bitcoin or other crypto rewards when you complete tasks as a developer. It is usually no small pittance either as you can earn up to $200 in free tokens. In short, a bounty is a bonus given in tokens in exchange for specialized work.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\n3. Brave Browser\n\nOne way to earn free bitcoin is by using Brave Browser for your browsing activities. Brave is a web browser that focuses on your privacy and saves you from data-sucking ads and lower speeds.

Cloud Mining\n\nCloud mining is the process of mining cryptocurrency without owning the specific hardware. By renting cloud computing resources with certain companies, you can earn free bitcoin and become a bitcoin miner. For example, Bytebus is a cloud mining service that offers you a $10 sign-up bonus just for registering.\n\n5. CoinMarketCap\n\nCoinMarketCap offers you the opportunity to earn free crypto assets like bitcoin by taking lessons and then testing your knowledge. You simply watch videos about crypto projects, complete quizzes about the videos you watch and then collect your crypto rewards. This system is packed with both educational and financial bonuses.\n\n6. Faucets\n\nBitcoin faucets or crypto faucets are websites and apps that give away free bitcoin in exchange for completing tasks or actions. Though the amount you earn per task is small, it can add up, thus being referred to as a faucet as many small drops of water can add up to a large amount. Here are some examples of actions you can complete to earn free bitcoin:\n\nView ads\n\nWatch videos\n\nComplete a captcha\n\nSolve puzzles\n\nPlay games\n\n7. Staking\n\nStaking involves locking up your funds in your wallet or exchange for a set period of time to help secure the network. By doing this you can earn rewards such as free bitcoin. As you\u2019ll have to do without those funds for that set period make sure you understand what you are staking and that the risk doesn\u2019t outweigh the reward.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nFinal Take To GO\n\nWhen dealing with bitcoin, keep in mind that at most you are typically dealing with extremely small fractions of a whole. Collecting or earning as much as you can is worth it though, especially if you can do so for free. To get the most bang for your digital buck, make sure you research all the set requirements so you can take advantage of multiple ways to earn free bitcoin.\n\nFAQ Here are answers to frequently asked questions about how to earn free bitcoin now.

As per Dune\u2019s data, text type Ordinals were followed by image type and others.\n\nAdditionally, the increase in number of inscriptions was also accompanied by a massive surge in Ordinals fees paid, which also reached a new ATH on 2 May 2023.\n\nTom Wan, a research analyst, pointed out an interesting development. Despite the massive increase in the number of inscriptions, the average block size decreased.\n\n6/ Block Size Decreases with Text Type Ordinals Dominating Despite hitting ATH in daily inscriptions, the average block size decreases from an ATH (2.52MB on 12 Feb) to 1.57MB Major Cause: Size of Image Inscriptions > Text Inscriptions by ~ 7 times pic.twitter.com/g7EtW64dq2 \u2014 Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) May 2, 2023\n\nThe reason behind this decline was the dominance of text type Ordinals. As text type Ordinals\u2019 size is less than that of image-type Ordinals, the average block size declined from its ATH of 2.5 MB to 1.57 MB.\n\nMiners enjoyed the episode\n\nOrdinals\u2019 latest achievement also brought good news for miners. While Ordinals hit a new ATH, a hike in BTC\u2019s hashrate was also seen, suggesting an influx of new miners in the network.\n\nMoreover, thanks to the increase in fees of Ordinals, miners also generated more revenue. As evident from Glassnode\u2019s chart, miners\u2019 total revenue in BTC registered a spike on 1 May, 2023.\n\nBitcoin investors should consider this\n\nThough things looked good for the miners, the same can\u2019t be said for investors. A look at BTC\u2019s hash ribbon displayed the possibility of the 60-day moving average (MA) flipping the 30-day MA.\n\nSuch a flip suggests that the market is not appropriate for more accumulation. Therefore, if the flip happens, BTC might be subjected to a price correction.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24\n\nThe trouble is for real\n\nCryptoQuant\u2019s data revealed that at the time of writing, Bitcoin\u2019s exchange reserve was increasing, suggesting higher selling pressure. The increased sell pressure was also proven by BTC\u2019s red aSORP, which indicated that more investors were selling at a profit.\n\nIn addition to that, BTC\u2019s taker buy/sell ratio pointed out that selling sentiment was dominant in the derivatives market, which was also a negative signal. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin\u2019s price increased by nearly 2% in the last 24 hours and at press time, it was trading at $28,481.10 with a market capitalization of over $551 billion."

        "content": "Centbee users in Europe can now cash their Bitcoin directly to their euro bank accounts. The new feature gives Bitcoin users the most convenient way yet to spend their digital assets.\n\nWhile Bitcoin payments continue to take root across the globe, fiat is still king. For years, Bitcoin users have had to turn to off-ramp rails that can be inaccessible, unreliable, or costly to spend their Bitcoin. Not anymore.\n\nCentbee now allows its users to cash out their Bitcoin into their bank accounts.\n\nNeed physical cash? Now you can send money straight to your \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa Bank Account from #Centbee and get Euros! It's easy, fast and cheap. All you need is an IBAN number! On Send screen tap the + button to add a Bank. \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udcb6#SEPA #BankAccounts #Cashhttps://t.co/ehgxZMLk25 pic.twitter.com/YVmSy1PkiX \u2014 Centbee (@Centbee) April 25, 2023\n\n\u201cNow, Centbee users in Europe will be able to send their Bitcoin SV directly to all SEPA-supporting banks, offering a convenient off-ramp for those looking to convert their Bitcoin into Euros,\u201d Centbee CEO and co-founder Lorien Gamaroff tells CoinGeek.\n\nUsers can then withdraw their euros from ATMs across the region, giving them \u201ca tangible way to spend their cryptocurrency,\u201d Gamaroff added.\n\nCentbee has always been about making Bitcoin easier to spend. The wallet already allows its users to make payments directly with their Bitcoin to some of the world\u2019s biggest retailers, from Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Users in its native South Africa can pay for utilities, shop, pay for online subscriptions, and more directly with their Bitcoin.\n\nThe latest feature is the next step in the company\u2019s mission. As Gamaroff points out, it bridges the gap for users who wish to keep their cash digitally on the Centbee wallet but may need to draw physical cash at an ATM for offline payments.\n\n\u201cThis new development is a significant step for Centbee and a game-changer for Bitcoin SV holders in Europe. The ability to convert Bitcoin into Euros provides greater flexibility and less uncertainty for those looking to use their digital assets in their day-to-day lives,\u201d Gamaroff tells CoinGeek.\n\nThe new feature comes at a time when BSV has faced delistings from some major exchanges, including Bittrex, Bitvavo, and Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD). On the one hand, these delistings serve to unshackle BSV from the near-ubiquitous culture of token speculation prevalent in \u2018crypto circles.\u2019 However, they have also denied millions a convenient, easily-accessible platform to buy and sell Bitcoin.\n\nCentbee \u201caims to provide some much-needed relief\u201d with the new feature.\n\nThe support for European banks is just the start. Gamaroff disclosed that the company is working on bank transfers to several more countries over the coming weeks.\n\nMaking Bitcoin usable\n\nCentbee\u2019s mission is to make Bitcoin usable for day-to-day needs. This includes cross-border transfers, a sector that continues to be burdened by high costs, slow transactions, and overall inefficiency. The wallet offers a simple, intuitive, and cheap alternative to legacy financial systems.\n\n\u201cWith Centbee, users can send money with ease and confidence, knowing that their loved ones will receive it quickly and at a fraction of the cost charged by traditional money transfer operators,\u201d Gamaroff points out.\n\nThe era of utility is finally here. Gone are the days when scrappy white papers with a dash of \u201cto-the-moon\u201d pledges would birth a digital asset unicorn. Many companies that shot to the top based on hype are crumbling as the wheat and the chaff get separated.\n\nCentbee stands tall among the platforms offering users real utility. Gamaroff pledges to continue leveraging the massively scaling BSV blockchain to \u201coffer more efficient and cost-effective financial solutions to our users.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs more people begin to see the advantages of the BSV blockchain, we anticipate continued growth in the adoption of digital currencies and the realization of the transformative potential of blockchain technology.\u201d\n\nCoinGeek Weekly Livestream with Lorien Gamaroff: Enabling BSV Payments to major retailers\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Why is the Price of Bitcoin Different Across the Other Exchanges - Upstox",
        "content": "Bitcoin is one among the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. Its value has skyrocketed in recent years. However, its price is often different on different exchanges, which is something most people do not fully understand. In this article, we glance at some reasons for this phenomenon.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to understand that Bitcoin is a decentralised currency. Unlike traditional currencies, which central banks control, Bitcoin is traded peer-to-peer, which means anyone can buy or sell it. As a result, the price of Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand on the open market.\n\nHowever, the supply and demand of Bitcoin may differ on different exchanges due to a variety of factors, such as:\n\nInvest Right, Invest Now Open a FREE*\n\nDemat + Trading account and enjoy Zero commission* on Mutual Funds and IPO \u20b920* per order on Equity, F&O, Commodity and Currency *By signing up you agree to our Terms and Conditions\n\nLiquidity\n\nLiquidity is a critical factor that affects the price of Bitcoin on different exchanges. In general, higher liquidity means more buyers and sellers, which leads to a fairer price. When there is more competition between buyers and sellers, there are tighter bid-ask spreads (the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept).\n\nIn contrast, lower liquidity can lead to higher price volatility, because there are fewer buyers and sellers to stabilise the price. This can create wider bid-ask spreads, so buyers may have to pay more to acquire Bitcoin, and sellers may receive less for selling Bitcoin.\n\nMarket demand\n\nMarket demand is another important factor that can impact the price of Bitcoin on different exchanges. If there is high demand for Bitcoin on a particular exchange, the price will likely be higher than on a deal with lower demand. This is because there are more buyers than sellers, meaning buyers are willing to pay a higher price to acquire Bitcoin.\n\nVarious factors, including media coverage, market sentiment, and global events, can influence demand for Bitcoin. For example, positive media coverage about Bitcoin can create a buzz around cryptocurrency and increase demand. Similarly, negative news about Bitcoin, such as a major hack or regulatory crackdown can lead to a decrease in the number of orders and a corresponding drop in price.\n\nRegulations\n\nRegulations can impact the price of Bitcoin on different exchanges too. Some countries have strict rules on using Bitcoin, which limits the number of available exchanges. This leads to higher prices on exchanges operating within those regulatory frameworks.\n\nFor example, in China, the government has cracked down on Bitcoin trading and mining, causing a decrease in demand for Bitcoin and a corresponding drop in price. Similarly, in the United States, there are strict regulations around Bitcoin exchanges, meaning businesses operating within those regulations may have higher liquidity and price.\n\nGeographical location\n\nGeographical location can play a role in the price of Bitcoin on different exchanges as well. This is because the cost of living can vary widely between countries, impacting the prices buyers and sellers are willing to pay for Bitcoin.\n\nFor example, in a country where the cost of living is high, like Switzerland, buyers may likely have more disposable income. Therefore, they may be willing to pay more for Bitcoin. On the flip side, in a country where the cost of living is low, such as India, buyers may be less willing to pay a high price for Bitcoin.\n\nExchange fees\n\nAnother factor that can impact the price of Bitcoin on different exchanges is the exchange fees. Buyers and sellers may be less inclined to use an exchange if the business has high costs, leading to lower liquidity and price. On the other hand, an exchange with low fees may attract more buyers and sellers, which can lead to higher liquidity and price.\n\nNow that you understand the factors that influence the price of Bitcoin on different exchanges, here are some examples of how this works in practice.\n\nSize of the market\n\nThe market size is another essential factor that can impact the price of Bitcoin on different exchanges. Larger markets tend to have higher liquidity and more stable prices, while smaller markets can be more volatile and have wider bid-ask spreads. This is because larger markets have more buyers and sellers, so there is more competition and a greater likelihood of finding a buyer or seller at a fair price.\n\nAdditionally, the market capitalisation of Bitcoin can impact the price on individual exchanges. If the market capitalisation of Bitcoin is large and growing, it can create positive sentiment around the cryptocurrency and lead to higher demand and prices on all exchanges.\n\nIf the market capitalisation is decreasing, it can lead to a decrease in the number of orders and a corresponding drop in price on all exchanges. For example, the Bitcoin market in the United States is generally more prominent than in many other countries, meaning Bitcoin tends to be priced higher on US exchanges.\n\nExample: Coinbase vs Binance\n\nCoinbase is one of the most popular Bitcoin exchanges in the United States. It has high liquidity and is regulated by the US government. Conversely, Binance is a popular exchange in Asia with lower fees, and it is not regulated by the US government.\n\nAt the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase was around $27,936, while the price on Binance was around $26,071. This is a significant difference that can be attributed to Coinbase having higher liquidity and being regulated by the US government, making it the more trusted exchange for American buyers.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the price of Bitcoin may vary widely between different exchanges due to a range of factors, including liquidity, market demand, regulations, geographical location, exchange fees, and the size of the market. By understanding these factors and carefully choosing which exchanges to buy and sell Bitcoin on, traders and investors can maximise their profits and minimise risks.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that the price of Bitcoin is inherently volatile and subject to change based on a wide range of factors, including global events, media coverage, and market sentiment. Therefore, it's vital to research and stay updated with the latest news and trends, so that you invest carefully and cautiously to avoid significant losses.\n\nUltimately, the success of your Bitcoin investments will depend on your ability to navigate these complex and ever-changing market conditions.\n\nNote: To help plan your trading activities and investment strategies, find here the NSE Holidays 2023, BSE Holidays 2023, MCX Holidays 2023, and Muhurat Trading 2023.

        "content": "The meme coin market boomed over the weekend with the attention created by Pepe (PEPE), which increased by over 1000% in just two days. This new meme coin has shocked analysts who formally predicted that trading volume would slow during the first week of May. While projects like Bitcoin (BTC) have started to do just that, Collateral Network (COLT) and Pepe (PEPE) have experienced huge surges in trading volume.\n\nWhile Pepe has surged 1000%, analysts are predicting a 3500% surge for Collateral Network.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCollateral Network \u2013 Best Token Presale In 2023\n\nCollateral Network has capitalized on the new attention to DeFi created by Pepe, selling almost 50% of its latest presale rounds supply. The Collateral Network project is quickly building momentum throughout the DeFi market and is expected to increase in price by 3500% before its presale ends.\n\nCollateral Network is unlike any other project in the market. The project developers have created an innovative platform that lets individuals unlock liquidity from otherwise illiquid assets such as super cars, jewelry and real estate on the blockchain. Instead of needing to physically sell the asset, they can take out a loan against it through the clever use of asset backed NFTs.\n\nTo optimize the number of investors who can loan money, NFTs are fractionalized so investors can get involved with smaller amounts of capital without needing to fund the entire loan and generate a weekly interest rate, paid weekly.\n\nWith the presale gaining popularity, COLT tokens are expected to increase from $0.014 to $0.0168, marking a 68% ROI in the next week alone possible for early investors of COLT.\n\n>>BUY COLT TOKENS NOW<<\n\nPepe Meme Surges 1000% Over The Weekend\n\nPepe, a new memecoin that builds on the famous pepe meme, is the latest cryptocurrency to make headlines. On the 1st of May, Pepe (PEPE) increased in price by over 1000% to $0.000001384.\n\nThis price hike resulted in a popularity boost across Twitter, and caused its user base to increase from just a few hundred investors to over 78,000. On Monday the 1st, Pepe was also listed on the cryptocurrency exchange MEXC Global, which is best known for its wide range of memecoins. This has made purchasing Pepe significantly easier than before and is expected to trigger additional trading rallies.\n\nDue to its sudden popularity, Pepe has been listed on Coinmarketcap, which caused trading volume to surge to over half a billion USD. Though its value has since decreased by 13.92%, investors expect Pepe to continue influencing the memecoin market throughout May.\n\nCan Bitcoin\u2019s Price Rise Again In May?\n\nBitcoin made mainstream headlines in April after becoming one of the best-performing assets in the world. While the traditional banking sector experienced an increase in turbulence, Bitcoin (BTC) increased in price to $30,979, sparking a huge rise in trading volume throughout the crypto market. However, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has started to decline gradually moving into May.\n\nOver the last five days, Bitcoins (BTC) price has decreased by 1.81%, with one Bitcoin selling for $28,743 at the time of writing. Despite this decline, daily trading volume has remained above $15 billion daily, which implies that investors remain bullish about Bitcoin.\n\nAnalysts however have split predictions as to whether or not Bitcoin will rise or fall over the next few weeks. While some suggest an additional surge could take Bitcoin to $31k, others believe that Bitcoin growth may temporarily slow as the market corrects itself.\n\nFind out more about the Collateral Network presale here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.collateralnetwork.io/\n\nPresale: https://app.collateralnetwork.io/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/collateralnwk\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Collateralnwk\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bhutan plans a $500 million fund for crypto mining in the Himalayas - The Times of India",
        "content": "Economic strategy\n\nConstruction timetable\n\nBhutan\u2019s investment arm and Nasdaq-listed company Bitdeer Technologies Group plan to seek investors for a fund worth up to $500 million that will be used to develop green crypto mining in the Himalayan kingdom.Fund raising targeting institutional investors will begin at the end of May and the goal is to set up carbon-free digital mining that taps Bhutan\u2019s abundant hydroelectric power, according to a joint statement Wednesday.Mining is the least risky way for Bhutan to tap crypto opportunities and for now the nation will focus on Bitcoin , Ujjwal Deep Dahal, the chief executive officer of the investment arm, Druk Holding & Investments, said in an interview.\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to look at assets that are low volume, high value, or digital assets for that matter, and try to position ourselves in a way that we can be competitive globally over time to build our economy,\u201d Dahal said.Forest-laden Bhutan, sandwiched between China and India, has a population of about 777,000 and has long sought to diversify an economy reliant on hydropower revenues. Druk manages the government\u2019s investments in traditional areas like stocks, bonds, technology, energy and real estate but also crypto mining and investment under what it calls a \u201cfuture-facing\u201d strategy.Bitcoin miners race to solve complex mathematical puzzles using energy-hungry computing rigs, earning new supply of the token in return. That\u2019s led to criticism of the environmental fallout when dirty fuels supply the power.Miners were squeezed by a crash in digital-asset prices, rising energy costs and increased competition last year. Conditions have improved in 2023 amid a rebound in the crypto market.Singapore-based Bitdeer, owned by Chinese entrepreneur Jihan Wu, is one of the top crypto miners by computer power and has one of the largest centers in Texas. The firm began trading on the Nasdaq last month after a long-delayed merger with a special purpose acquisition company finally closed.Bitdeer expects to set up a 100-megawatt operation in Bhutan, with construction slated to start in the second quarter and be completed in July through September, a regulatory filing shows.The company and Druk will also invest in the planned new fund, Bitdeer\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Matt Linghui Kong said in an interview.Druk ventured into crypto mining under a \u201csandbox\u201d approach when Bitcoin was at about $5,000, Dahal said. It also had some investments with the now bankrupt US digital-asset lenders BlockFi Inc. and Celsius Network LLC but they were a small part of Druk\u2019s portfolio and have been \u201csettled,\u201d Dahal added.Bitcoin surged to a record high of almost $69,000 in a pandemic-era crypto boom that peaked in 2021. The largest digital asset then sank below $16,000 in 2022 but has since rebounded to about $28,500.Bhutan\u2019s foray into the volatile and sometimes scandalous world of crypto is notable given that the nation is famed for using a \u201cGross National Happiness\u201d index to gauge economic success. The gauge takes into account elements such as psychological wellbeing and ecological diversity to measure the standard of living."

He has since become a self-made billionaire, investor, and entrepreneur.\n\nHe spent his formative years on the tough streets of Burgersfort, a town in South Africa\u2019s Mpumalanga province, though he was raised in several different African countries.\n\nDespite having a tough upbringing in a low-income family, Ziggy worked odd jobs, beginning with dishwashing at the tender age of 17. Later in life, he became known for his skills as a disc jockey and was given the nickname \u201cMaster Ziggy.\u201d\n\nHowever, in 2013, he was arrested for attempted murder and possessing an illegal semi-automatic weapon due to his participation in criminal groups.\n\nWhile incarcerated, Mr. Ziggy Xolane Ndhlovu availed himself of the opportunity to read the esteemed biography of Sir Richard Branson, \u201cLosing My Virginity.\u201d Through this, he adopted the business philosophy the renowned British entrepreneur espoused.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2017, he invested in the burgeoning field of crypto-blockchain technology, which resulted in the acquisition of his first billion-rand fortune.\n\nFour years after this initial investment, his investment in Binance (BNB) was valued at R1.3 billion, establishing him as one of Africa\u2019s most successful crypto blockchain investors.\n\nHe currently has a net worth of more than R6 billion and is a well-known investor in fintech and unicorns throughout the continent, including Bolt and Polkadot.\n\nFurthermore, his trans-Africa digital-only bank, DafriBank Digital LTD, launched digital shares worth $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nBy educating people about Bitcoin through Crypto Mag, a wholly owned subsidiary of his UMEH Media Group, he has become one of the most prominent advocates for the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies across the African continent.\n\nHe also provides the most funding for events that foster cryptocurrency discussions, such as the Blockchain Africa Conference.\n\nMpho Dagada\n\nNet Worth: Unknown\n\nBeen trading since 2014\n\nMpho Dagada was enrolled in the University of Johannesburg when he started participating in trading Bitcoin. When he started trading, one Bitcoin cost $200, and he bought a few, which he then held.\n\nBy 2015, Mpho noticed that the price had increased, and he realized the potential profit in Bitcoin. After this realization, Mpho started focusing on trading other cryptocurrencies, allowing him to expand his understanding and knowledge regarding financial assets.\n\nAs an early investor, Mpho became one of a few South Africans interested in Bitcoin in South Africa. He noticed that the popularity of Bitcoin had increased drastically, and he continued studying the trends.\n\nFrom here, Mpho developed a keen interest in blockchain technology and kept trading Bitcoin. With his profits, he started a logistics company and franchising.\n\nMpho had the opportunity to visit New York, London, and San Francisco, where he publically spoke about cryptocurrency. But, according to Mpho, a core achievement for him was visiting Silicon Valley after being chosen from over 200,000 entrepreneurs by TrepCamp.\n\nThis trip allowed him to visit Google, Facebook, and Sales Force headquarters to see how their operations are run. Furthermore, he was chosen as a delegate in 2011 to attend One Young World in Switzerland, a prominent global forum for young leaders.\n\nDagada, who possessed a remarkable talent for persuasion and was named the Anglo-American Young Communicator Ambassador in Limpopo in 2012, considers himself an original.\n\nIn addition, Dagada claims to have made more than $100,000 in cryptocurrency, which is more than 1 million ZAR.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Trading, and How do Traders Make a Profit?\n\nBitcoin trading is purchasing and selling Bitcoins on an online exchange. Those who acquire Bitcoin at a low price and sell it later at a higher price, or vice versa, might profit.\n\nSome traders employ exotic tactics like margin trading, short selling, and derivatives trading to maximize their profits.\n\nWith margin trading, investors can borrow funds from their broker to trade a bigger volume of Bitcoin than they could with their funds alone. The investor can pocket the difference between the borrowed amount and the increased Bitcoin price.\n\nBy selling Bitcoin they do not currently possess, \u201cshort sellers\u201d bet on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price falling. If the price of Bitcoin drops, the trader can benefit by purchasing the cryptocurrency at a cheaper rate.\n\nDerivatives trading allows investors to make bets on Bitcoin\u2019s price without owning any Bitcoin. Futures and options contracts, two derivatives, can be leveraged to earn money off such price differences.\n\nHow to Choose the Right Bitcoin Broker in South Africa?\n\nThere is a proliferation of both established and new brokers offering contracts for different trading options to clients to meet the rising demand in the market.\n\nWhen deciding on a broker, it is crucial to remember that CFD trading is predicated on a contractual relationship between the trading company and its client rather than a traditional buy-and-sell exchange.\n\nThe opening and closing prices will completely determine your gain or loss. Therefore, ensure your broker does not manipulate pricing and uses honest trade data.\n\nIn that case, it will not matter how accurate your price predictions are; you will never profit from changes in Bitcoin prices. It is tricky because there is no centralized repository for cryptocurrency quotes right now, and the rates on various exchanges might vary widely.\n\nTransaction Fees\n\nRegarding trading cryptocurrency, some brokers may charge additional fees beyond the spread. In addition, the gap between buying and selling prices for digital currencies can be significant, which means it can be harder to profit from price movements.\n\nThe cost of trading can vary, from as low as $5 to as high as $15 per trade. Therefore, it is important to check and compare the fees from different brokers before deciding.\n\nOverall sign-up process\n\nThe importance of the user\u2019s experience is rising. Sign-up ease is a strong indicator of how well you will get along with the platform. By looking at the registration process, you can learn a lot about a broker platform and how user-friendly it is.\n\nWhen a broker asks for a substantial deposit as part of the sign-up process, that should raise red flags. In contrast, reputable cryptocurrency brokers typically charge new consumers zero or exceptionally low fees for signing up.\n\nIt is important to exercise caution and confirm the commission and other fees that will be incurred after you select such a broker.\n\nRange of Digital Assets Offered\n\nSome cryptocurrency traders may find satisfaction in a limited selection of currency pairs, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and other coins against the US dollar.\n\nHowever, other brokers may offer a more extensive range of crypto contracts for difference (CFDs), providing greater diversity in trading options.\n\nRestricting oneself to a narrow range of crypto pairs may limit the potential opportunities in cryptocurrency trading, thus necessitating the exploration of additional asset classes, such as foreign exchange or commodities, to diversify one\u2019s portfolio.\n\nThe credibility of the broker\n\nDespite the developing nature of the cryptocurrency trading industry, it is important to seek out reputable and well-informed brokers to aid in effective trading.\n\nSouth Africans should investigate the qualifications, licenses, and customer reviews of potential brokers to understand the services they offer and determine if they align with your needs.\n\nAssessing the broker\u2019s record of accomplishment and platform is crucial, but one should also consider the duration of their operation in the market.\n\nA broker platform that has sustained longevity in the industry is a strong indication of the provision of satisfactory services, as it reflects customer patronage.\n\nAvailability of a Demo Account\n\nEveryone just getting into cryptocurrency trading should begin with a free demo account. However, because there is no basic data available and all trading is conducted through the examination of charts, the price of cryptocurrency is highly unpredictable, making it difficult to invest.\n\nTrading Platform and Security of the Broker\u2019s Website\n\nWhen searching for a Bitcoin broker, the availability of an online platform for clients should be of paramount importance. The absence of such a platform should serve as a red flag, indicating that the broker might not be trustworthy.\n\nAn online platform allows for easy management of cryptocurrency trading for users. Furthermore, a well-designed platform provides access to a wide range of options from a convenient location.\n\nWhether you are a novice or an experienced trader, it is important to seek out a platform that offers the most current information on cryptocurrency trading.\n\nAdditionally, the safety of a platform can be determined by examining the presence of an SSL certificate in the top left corner of the search bar. This certificate confirms that the website is secure, so client information will not be susceptible to hacking.\n\nLeverage\n\nWhen compared to other assets, cryptos typically have a much lower leverage of 2:1. It is true that high volatility markets make it risky to use a lot of leverage. However, traders will still want access to some.\n\nSouth Africans must verify that the level of leverage they use is appropriate for the level of risk they are willing to take.\n\nTechnical Support\n\nCustomer assistance can address more general concerns, while technical support teams can assist with more complex issues. These two types of support are distinct. Technical support specialists are equipped to handle problems requiring specialized knowledge.\n\nUnfortunately, many Bitcoin traders lack this type of assistance. In the cryptocurrency industry, technical support is crucial for addressing issues that require specialized expertise.\n\nThese experts deeply understand how everything works and can provide prompt assistance. Additionally, a trading platform with quick technical support can save you time.\n\nThe Best Bitcoin Brokers in South Africa\n\nIn this article, we have listed the best brokers that offer Bitcoin and CFD trading to South African traders.

In recent times, an increasing number of individuals have begun to consider Bitcoin a potential revenue source.\n\nSuppose you have determined this is an appropriate course of action. In that case, you must acquire knowledge of the various methods available to generate income through Bitcoin.\n\nIt is worth noting that multiple strategies exist for earning revenue through this digital currency. Gaining familiarity with each of them will enable you to select the most suitable approach for your circumstances.\n\nHODLing Bitcoin\n\nThis is the greatest way to get started with cryptocurrency trading. Because the word \u201cHODLing,\u201d a pun on \u201cHold,\u201d means investing in cryptocurrency to keep your tokens for the foreseeable future.\n\nJust like buying stocks and holding on to them for the long haul, this makes no sense at all. When investing in well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, you can do so without worrying about price changes in the short term.\n\nPlay-to-Earn Games\n\nSome South Africans might be astonished to hear that playing games might earn them cryptocurrency. But, unbelievably, the play-to-earn crypto game industry is worth billions of dollars.\n\nAffiliate Marketing using Bitcoin\n\nThrough affiliate marketing, you can earn money by recruiting your friends and family to work for you.\n\nThe simplicity and utility of this approach make it a popular choice; thus, you can expect to see it widely employed in this field. In addition, the use of affiliate programs can help bring in new clients.\n\nHowever, before committing resources, it is important to consider each available inducement carefully.\n\nLend Bitcoin\n\nMany people utilize Bitcoin lending as a means of generating income. Bitcoin lending on various platforms is a frequent technique for investors to acquire funds rapidly because of the income they may earn.\n\nInvestors typically tack on interest when giving out Bitcoin, and the agreement allows for this. Because of this, they will earn a substantial interest rate on Bitcoin loans.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin lending can be done on a short- or long-term basis, depending on the borrower\u2019s preference and the lender\u2019s investment horizon.\n\nBitcoin Faucets\n\nFaucet websites are another way for people to make Bitcoin. Fortunately, this should not be an issue, as there are many faucet sites from which to choose. Furthermore, it is easy to earn Bitcoin; you must choose a site and complete the necessary tasks daily.\n\nSwing Trading Bitcoin\n\nThe term \u201cswing trading\u201d refers to another technique employed by investors. Day trading is a short-term strategy, whereas holding is a long-term investment. Trading on the swings is a strategy that falls somewhere in the center.\n\nFurthermore, swing traders make purchases at low prices and stick to their investments in the hope that the price will rise. In such a case, they will sell at a premium.\n\nDay Trading Bitcoin\n\nDay trading is a highly effective method of making money with cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere is a minor caveat, though: you will need to know how to use the top cryptocurrency analysis tools to predict whether the token\u2019s price will climb. Nevertheless, day trading cryptocurrency might be very profitable if you can achieve this.\n\nWhen day trading cryptocurrencies, you aim to capitalize on price fluctuations that last only a day or two.\n\nTo add insult to injury, a seasoned trader in this market will typically not keep a position open for more than a day. So, the plan is to trade frequently and start new positions to generate consistent, if modest, gains.\n\nBitcoin Mining\n\nCryptocurrency mining is the first and still the best way to profit from the cryptocurrency market. However, mining is still necessary for the Proof of Work system to function.

Mining that includes maintaining a master node and expertise and a sizable initial and continuous financial commitment is needed.\n\nCrypto social media\n\nContent creation and curation on many blockchain-based social media sites will reward you.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin trading, and crypto trading overall, is an extremely exciting and fast-paced activity that allows South Africans to profit when they invest at the right time or sell their holdings. However, because of the trading volume and subsequent volatility, Bitcoin trading is extremely risky.\n\nTherefore, South African traders should consider starting small and building their Bitcoin investment long-term.
