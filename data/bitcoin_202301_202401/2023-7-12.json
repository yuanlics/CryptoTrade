But one corner of the market is suddenly garnering enthusiasm: Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nSome of the biggest and most established names on Wall Street are filing or refiling applications with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in an attempt to be the first to release such a product. A Bitcoin ETF would invest in the cryptocurrency on behalf of its shareholders.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) that once belonged to the Silk Road is on the move \u2014 about four months after the US Department of Justice (DOJ) sold millions of dollars worth of it on Coinbase.\n\nA string of transactions involving Silk Road bitcoin was waiting to be confirmed Wednesday morning. Altogether, 9,825 BTC ($302.2 million) queued for sending by addresses tied to the DOJ.\n\nThe addresses are directing the bitcoin to unused addresses. The DOJ has shuffled its Silk Road stash before, so it\u2019s too soon to say it intends to be sold immediately.\n\nStill, authorities offloaded 9,800 BTC in March directly to US-based platform Coinbase for $21,800 per token, generating $215 million.\n\nAt the time, officials said they intended to sell an additional 41,500 BTC ($1.27 billion) seized from Silk Road hacker James Zhong across four batches.\n\nBitcoin is today worth $31,600 after shedding a few hundred dollars after word of the transfers first broke.\n\nSilk Road, one of the first marketplaces powered by bitcoin payments, went dark in October 2013 as US authorities arrested founder Ross Ulbricht. He was charged the following year and eventually sentenced to consecutive life sentences plus 40 years without parole.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s pending Silk Road transactions are currently facing a confirmation delay, potentially caused by inadequate transaction fees. (The transactions were later confirmed.)\n\nOne had been waiting 20 minutes at time of writing, another for more than 40 minutes, with both blocks unconfirmed. The DOJ appears to have only allocated a meager sum, only $8 in fees, for these transactions. Bitcoin blocks are processed on average once every 10 minutes.\n\nThe last time the department sold coins connected to the Silk Road, the US government paid more than $215,000 in transaction fees, officials said in court filings.\n\nA portal tracking bitcoin seized by the US government shows the Feds have missed out on $5.6 billion by selling BTC rather than holding it.\n\nUpdated Jul. 12, 2023 at 11:09 am ET: Two transactions were confirmed after around an hour. A third transaction is still pending after almost two hours. Code is law.\n\nUpdated Jul. 12, 2023 at 11:31 am ET: The third transaction was finalized after around two hours and five minutes.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could finally change its tune regarding spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds. A notable rally in the largest cryptocurrency fueled speculation. And data indicate large institutional players are increasing their Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThat could prove impactful for equity-based, crypto-related exchange traded funds, such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) . Actually, it already is as SATO is higher by a staggering 147% on a year-to-date basis.\n\nBitcoin has been trending higher over the past several weeks as a slew of traditional asset managers, including some of the biggest names in the ETF industry, filed applications for spot biotin ETFs. And that\u2019s a sign credible money managers and fund issuers see long-term viability in it. As such, fund holdings of the digital asset are approaching 696,000 coins.\n\nWhy It Matters to SATO\n\nSATO follows the Alerian Galaxy Global Cryptocurrency-Focused Blockchain Equity, Trusts, and ETPs Index. And the bulk of its 35 equity holdings engage in crypto mining. This industry correlates to the prices of the assets mined.\n\nSo the higher Bitcoin prices go, the more benefits SATO holdings accrue. A clear, efficient avenue for higher Bitcoin prices is for more institutional buyers to enter the market. But not only do they buy in size, they bring credibility to an asset class that\u2019s long faced doubts and concerns regarding volatility and excessive speculation by smaller investors.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, though, recent news of new entrants into Bitcoin underscores the staying power of this asset class more broadly. And many investors view this as a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity,\u201d Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an interview with CNBC.\n\nGrayscale is the company behind the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) . And that Bitcoin-backed index is SATO\u2019s largest holding at a weight of 15% and is a prime candidate to convert to the ETF wrapper, should the SEC approve spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOther data points confirm institutional adoption and retailer investors holding Bitcoin for longer periods, including a declining number of Bitcoin on public exchanges. Both could be pivotal in establishing near-term price support for the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cAs the decline in inflows and supply unfolds, another intriguing trend emerges. Institutional fund accumulation, as observed by CryptoQuant. Institutional investors, including hedge funds, investment firms, and cryptocurrency private funds, are currently actively increasing their holdings of Bitcoin,\u201d reported Newsbtc.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel .\n\nvettafi.com is owned by VettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d).

He added that while the firm finds blockchain technology compelling, crypto \u201cdoesn\u2019t fit from an investment perspective.\u201d\n\nVanguard declined to comment further.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "My first journalism job was so long ago that we were required to capitalize Blockchain.\n\nDoes looking at Blockchain (look, I did it again) capitalized in the middle of a sentence like that make you uncomfortable?\n\nIt makes me uncomfortable.\n\nThankfully, we\u2019ve since moved on as a society. We now recognize blockchain as just another technology, so it has naturally lost its need for that capital \u201cB\u201d.\n\nBitcoin, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t seem to carry the same simplicity.\n\nYou\u2019ll see both Bitcoin and bitcoin in the wild, seemingly changing form as one hops among the various media.\n\nYou\u2019ll hear that \u201cbitcoin\u201d is a currency, so it is left uncapitalized, like dollars, yen, euros, krona. But \u201cBitcoin\u201d is the formal name of the network \u2014 thus, it needs that proper noun capitalization.\n\nOh, wait! \u201cBitcoin\u201d is both a network and a currency, so it must always be capitalized. But then \u201cbitcoin\u201d needs to match \u201cblockchain,\u201d so it definitely must never be capitalized. Yet \u201cbitcoins\u201d isn\u2019t a word, since \u201cyens\u201d isn\u2019t a word, so \u201cbitcoin\u201d can also be plural.\n\nOn the other hand, \u201cbitcoins\u201d has to be a word, because \u201cdollars\u201d is a word, so \u201cbitcoin\u201d can\u2019t really be plural.\n\nThis type of semantic dispute may only be interesting to grammar freaks and die-hard crypto enthusiasts, but the confusion \u2014 and frustration in both camps \u2014 speaks to the industry\u2019s broader language dilemma.\n\nTo put it bluntly, crypto has a really hard time being understood, and it\u2019s entirely its own fault.\n\nTo on-chain or not to onchain\n\nCrypto Twitter, per usual, hosted the latest crypto language debate this week.\n\nA small group of enthusiasts (read: tiny, fewer than 100 followers) is attempting to raise enough money to buy a billboard next to Mirriam Webster\u2019s headquarters that reads \u201conchain is a new word.\u201d\n\nCrypto Twitter pedants went, well, a little nuts in response.\n\nNot over whether minting NFTs of a simulated \u201conchain\u201d dictionary definition is a waste of money, but whether one should write \u201conchain\u201d rather than \u201con-chain\u201d in a pitch to America\u2019s oldest dictionary publisher.\n\nBlockworks wasn\u2019t immune to the irresistible allure of this burning question. When I attempted to ask colleagues about their thoughts regarding on-chain vs onchain, the resulting opinions were so cacophonous I couldn\u2019t finish my sentence.\n\nEveryone seems to be sweating the little stuff rather than addressing the bigger issue: No one knows what the hell we\u2019re talking about most of the time.\n\nBecause crypto naming conventions are even sillier than Baby Gronk, the new Drip King, getting rizzed up by Livvy.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s baffling that crypto spends any time arguing about such matters when the names of some of the industry\u2019s most public-facing companies are just as confusing.\n\nTo list a few: Consensus, ConsenSys, BlockFi, Blockfolio, The Block, Blockworks (sorry), Cointelegraph, CoinDesk, Coinbase, Coingecko, CoinMarketCap\u2026you get the picture.\n\nWe weren\u2019t so smart about names in the beginning, and it\u2019s starting to catch up to us. With each new crypto innovation \u2014 Ordinals, Ethscriptions, staking, stacking, yield farming \u2014 we\u2019re actually moving further away from developing a lexicon that anyone besides us can actually understand.\n\nIn this fast-moving tech environment, it\u2019s crypto builders (rather than any linguists) who have the responsibility of naming new technologies. And they are failing.\n\nYes, there are few words and phrases that have successfully made it from the closed crypto inner sanctum to the mainstream. Last fall, Merriam Webster\u2019s new words list included metaverse, altcoin and unbanked.\n\nSo it\u2019s not too much of a longshot to imagine that onchain could actually make it in Merriam\u2019s next new words round (especially considering how unbanked also has no hyphen).\n\nWe just have to ask ourselves \u2014 how much does all this really matter?\n\nEven if we are somehow finally able to straighten things out and make some of these terms dictionary-official once and for all, we\u2019re still left with one linguistic mess after another. Like, how can a rollup be optimistic? Does it always have to have a cheerful disposition, or can it feel a little blue sometimes?\n\nCryptocurrency, and the various new inventions it brings, exists through the creation of a new language. And with the exception of a handful of cool Easter Egg names like market maker Wintermute (named after the sentient AI in William Gibson\u2019s sci-fi novel Neuromancer), crypto language is still in the stage of undecipherable inside baseball.\n\nIn fact, Merriam-Webster ironically doesn\u2019t even have the \u201ccorrect\u201d definition for the very word \u201ccrypto\u201d the way that the crypto industry uses it.\n\nFlip to the \u201cC\u201d section and you\u2019ll find this definition for crypto: \u201ca person who adheres or belongs secretly to a party, sect, or other group.\u201d\n\nHonestly, sounds about right.\n\nI don\u2019t care much about tech, I don\u2019t care a whole lot about finance, either. I care about writing stories and watching weird things unfold. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve ended up in crypto.\n\n\n\nBut because I\u2019m missing that passion for what crypto and blockchain are all about \u2014 finance, tech, privacy, yadda yadda \u2014 I\u2019m going to write instead about what I am actually interested in. Everything about crypto that has very little to do with crypto.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s what this column will be about. All the tangential stories that come out of the blockchain and crypto space, what I think about them, and how I navigate it all as a skeptical former Russian literature major.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s precisely my perch as an outsider that lets me do what I do: Opine on all sides of any crypto issue, no strings attached, no skin in the game.\n\n\n\nIf you want to talk crypto with me, let\u2019s go off topic."

However, it now says the fund is \u201con track\u201d to launch this month, having decided that last year \u201cthe time wasn\u2019t right\u201d following the Terra Luna cryptocurrency crash in May 2022 and crypto exchange FTX\u2019s collapse in November.\n\nThe asset manager says \u201cdemand has shifted since last summer\u201d.\n\nIn Europe all digital assets exchange traded products so far have been structured as exchange traded notes, rather than funds.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites Europe, a title owned by the FT Group.\n\nEach ETF shareholder owns a portion of a fund\u2019s underlying shares, while investors in ETNs own a debt security, not the underlying assets.\n\nJacobi has made much of the fact that it is launching an ETF rather than an exchange traded note.\n\nPeter Lane, co-founder and chief operating officer of Jacobi, told Ignites Europe last year that structured note issuers were guilty of \u201cmisuse\u201d of the ETF term.\n\n\u201cThere has been so much misinformation and misuse of the term ETF by [ETN] issuers, presumably to obfuscate the risks that are inherent in acquiring and investing in ETNs,\u201d he said.\n\nJacobi said its ETF, unlike ETNs, cannot be leveraged or use derivatives, which could otherwise lead to \u201csignificant counterparty risk\u201d.\n\nThe fund has been authorised in Guernsey, a jurisdiction that offers \u201ca number of advantages\u201d to help the launch of a bitcoin fund, said David Crosland, a partner in offshore law firm Carey Olsen.\n\n\u201cAs a specialist fund servicing jurisdiction that is not subject to the inherent inflexibilities of being an EU member, Guernsey was able to move quickly to adapt to support this launch,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c[Guernsey\u2019s] flexibility and willingness to understand the complex detail has allowed the promoter to launch a fund vehicle that benefits from regulated fund status when other European jurisdictions are unable to do so,\u201d Crosland added.\n\nMichael O\u2019Riordan, founding partner of ETF and digital assets consultancy Blackwater Search and Advisory, said the regulatory challenges of launching a bitcoin ETF in Europe were \u201cvery large\u201d as bitcoin was not considered an eligible asset under Ucits rules.\n\n\u201cHowever, in practice, apart from some structural differences, the ETF and the ETP are quite similar,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs an industry, we have not done a good job at distinguishing each and as a result there is a lot of confusion in the market as to which is which,\u201d O\u2019Riordan added.\n\nNet flows into European digital assets ETPs over the past 18 months amounted to $483mn, including inflows of $398mn in the third quarter of 2022 alone, according to data from Coinbase and Bloomberg.\n\nAssets in European digital assets ETPs stand at \u20ac4.3bn, having peaked at \u20ac10.5bn at the end of 2021, according to Ignites Europe analysis of Morningstar data.\n\n*Ignites Europe is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

        "content": "Approval for spot bitcoin ETFs hinges on a court battle between crypto firm Grayscale and the SEC. Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Jared Blikre checks out bitcoin's price action amid regulatory pressures.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Well, amid the surge in tech stocks, small caps, and government bonds, one asset class isn't participating in the latest run up. Bitcoin has held a tight trading range over the last three weeks as the industry braces for a critical decision in federal court, where Grayscale Investments, the manager of the world's largest publicly traded crypto fund is suing the SEC to allow a spot Bitcoin ETF to operate in the US market.\n\nYahoo Finance's Jared Blikre is here with those details. Hey, Jared.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Hey, there. And I thought before I got into the court case, I just begin with a year to date look at what's happening in cryptocurrency land. Bitcoin, up 85%. But as you said, Rachelle, we haven't seen a lot of that price action made recently. This is a-- let's see, let's get a year to date chart on there. And you can see over the last three weeks, basically treading water going sideways.\n\nHowever, given the fact that we are in the upper right hand side of this chart, this consolidation is actually bullish. And when you see what's overhead, let me put a three-year chart, the most price action in Bitcoin is lying directly ahead. And that's basically 30,000 to 40,000, goes up to maybe 50,000. But a ton of price memory in there. So not surprising to see Bitcoin at least taking a pause, and it could still reverse.\n\nBut back to the main point. This court case that we were talking about, Grayscale versus the SEC, they want to sue the SEC in order to allow them to convert into an ETF. They are currently an ETN, it gets into the weeds there. But they want to be able to be based their reference price on spot Bitcoin.\n\nAnd we saw in anticipation of a decision of that in this case, we saw BlackRock file for a Bitcoin ETF, a spot Bitcoin ETF only a few weeks ago. Then a bunch of other issuers piled on. Fidelity did as well, and they just issued a note, they just filed an amendment only today or yesterday with regard to their previous amendments. So things are moving along there. But is it going to be approved? Is the spot Bitcoin ETF going to be approved on its own merits or is it going to be forced and shoehorned in because of this court case? We don't know.\n\nBut nevertheless, Bitcoin poised-- poised, I should, say to break higher. But as we know in crypto, anything can happen.\n\n- It's true, we're always waiting for that breakout moment here, still waiting for it. But thank you for getting us up to speed, our very own Jared Blikre there."

        "title": "The economics of Bitcoin halving: Understanding the effects on price and market sentiment - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the pioneering cryptocurrency that sparked a global revolution in digital assets, operates on a unique monetary policy. One of the defining features of Bitcoin is its halving event, which occurs approximately every four years.\n\nThis article will explore the economics behind Bitcoin\u2019s halving, examining its effects on price movements and market sentiment. By understanding these factors, investors and enthusiasts can gain valuable insights into the cryptocurrency\u2019s market behavior.\n\nRelated: How does the monetary supply affect cryptocurrencies?\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin halving?\n\nA Bitcoin halving, also known as a \u201chalvening,\u201d refers to the predetermined reduction in the rate at which new BTC are created. It is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol and occurs every 210,000 blocks, which is roughly every four years. The halving event halves the block reward, reducing the number of newly minted Bitcoin awarded to miners.\n\nSupply and demand dynamics\n\nA Bitcoin halving directly impacts the supply and demand dynamics of the cryptocurrency. By reducing the rate at which new BTC enters the market, halving effectively reduces the available supply. As the supply decreases, assuming demand remains constant or increases, basic economic principles suggest that the price of Bitcoin should rise.\n\nSupply and demand is the basic economic principle supporting a price increase in response to Bitcoin\u2019s halving. The law of supply and demand states that prices tend to increase when a commodity\u2019s supply declines, and demand either stays the same or rises. The Bitcoin halving slows the rate of new Bitcoin creation and market release.\n\nAs a result, there are fewer newly created BTC available for purchase. The diminished supply produces a scarcity effect, which might push the price upward if demand for Bitcoin stays the same or rises.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s controlled supply is a key factor contributing to its value proposition. The total supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins, and the halving mechanism gradually reduces the rate at which new BTC are produced until the maximum supply is reached. This scarcity aspect, coupled with the increasing recognition and adoption of Bitcoin, can create a perception of limited availability and drive up demand, thereby impacting the price.\n\nHistorical price movements\n\nHalving events have frequently been associated with increases in the price of Bitcoin, with significant upward momentum both before and after previous halvings. For example, during the 2012 halving, Bitcoin\u2019s price soared from about $12 to over $200 in just one year. Similarly, Bitcoin experienced a stunning recovery after its 2016 price halving, reaching a high of about $19,700 in December 2017.\n\nFollowing the most recent halving event in May 2020, Bitcoin\u2019s price surged. Starting at $8,787 during the halving, the cryptocurrency experienced a remarkable rally, eventually reaching its all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nMarket attitude and investor perception\n\nBitcoin halving events often generate increased market attention and hype. Expectations of lower supply and likely price increases may fuel positive feelings among investors and traders. This optimism could result in higher demand for Bitcoin as traders try to profit from the expected price gain. As a result, a Bitcoin halving can result in the self-fulfilling prophecy of rising market sentiment and demand.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that during halving occurrences, market sentiment isn\u2019t always favorable. Market participants may also experience FUD around the potential effects of a price halving. Short-term price swings and heightened volatility may result from this conflicting sentiment.\n\nImpact on mining economics\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event may also impact mining economics. Block rewards and transaction fees are the primary sources of income for miners, which are essential to confirming transactions and safeguarding the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe decrease in block rewards caused by a halving event directly affects miner profitability. After a halving event, miners operating with increased expenses might find it less profitable to mine Bitcoin, which could result in a drop in mining activity.\n\nRelated: \u2018Don\u2019t short when it\u2019s dark green\u2019: How to trade the 2024 Bitcoin halving\n\nNetwork security and long-term outlook\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving may initially impact mining economics, but it also plays a critical role in preserving the network\u2019s long-term security and stability. Miners are encouraged to continue their activities and secure the network through transaction validation due to the carefully managed decline in block rewards.\n\nThe network becomes more robust and less dependent on freshly created currencies for security as the mining industry adapts to the decreased block rewards.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "In this issue\n\nBitcoin at US$120,000: Standard Chartered\u2019s high hopes Forkast 500 NFT Index: Another week, another low Sega partners Line: From game to blockchain\n\nFrom the Editor\u2019s Desk Dear Reader, Remember the \u201claser eyes\u201d trend that many Bitcoiners enthusiastically bought into back in 2021? Yes? Well, we\u2019ve been trying to forget it, too. But this week\u2019s news that Standard Chartered sees BTC potentially soaring to US$120,000 next year brings those memories flooding back. Given the relatively short time the crypto industry has been in full bloom, banks have managed to chalk up an impressive track record of making dramatic predictions and pronouncements on the price of the original crypto token. In early 2021, for instance, JPMorgan \u2013 despite being headed by noted fixture of the crypto-skeptic punditocracy Jamie Dimon \u2013 outdid even the believers, predicting a rise to US$146,000. In late 2020, a leaked report by Citibank predicted an even more extravagant valuation of US$300,000 by December the following year, a figure that would have required BTC\u2019s price to skyrocket 1,775%, or more than 18-fold. Standard Chartered\u2019s latest call on BTC rests on a logic of supply and demand, one of the bedrocks of established economics. As such, it has a certain degree of merit. However, while that bullish prediction may set hearts racing among long-suffering speculators in the crypto community, it relates only to one token in the space, and is predicated on only a limited number of factors. Admittedly, BTC\u2019s movements exercise a practically gravitational pull on the rest of the market. Yet even broad shifts in crypto prices are but a single dimension of the increasingly sophisticated digital asset ecosystem that has emerged in the past few years. BTC may bounce back, and even outperform to live up to the lofty expectations of the latest crop of analysts bold enough to be so bullish. But the damage wrought by the fevered speculation, hype and all-too-foreseeable misery that followed the headiness of 2021 have made the industry grow up quickly, moving its focus to the source of the more demonstrable and enduring value it can create: the spirit of pioneering innovation that animated it in the first place. It goes without saying that we want to see the crypto market back in the black, but it\u2019s what comes next in the expanding digital asset universe that excites us most. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast.News\n\n1. Great expectations\n\nHigher miner profitability per Bitcoin is a major factor for Standard Chartered\u2019s projection. Image: Standard Chartered/Canva\n\nBitcoin prices could rise to US$50,000 by the end of 2023 and US$120,000 in 2024, U.K. bank Standard Chartered predicted in a Monday research report, an increase from its projection of US$100,000 in April.\n\nHigher miner profitability per Bitcoin is one of the major factors fueling Standard Chartered\u2019s projection, allowing miners to \u201csell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher,\u201d Geoff Kendrick, head of foreign exchange and digital assets research at Standard Chartered, wrote in the report.\n\nKendrick noted that the 12 largest listed miners \u2014 which account for 20% of all global Bitcoin mining \u2014 sold 106% of mined Bitcoins in the first quarter of 2023, and estimated the proportion dropped to 100% in the second quarter, thanks to lower mining cost and higher Bitcoin prices that have gained over 85% since the start of the year.\n\n\u201cIf the BTC price rises to around US$50,000, which we expect by end-2023, the share of newly mined being sold should fall to 20-30%. That is a net annual reduction in selling of BTC 250,000 \u2014 a large number relative to Bitcoin market turnover,\u201d wrote Kendrick.\n\n\u201cWhile predicting the timing of market moves is always tricky, the case for a significant increase in the price of Bitcoin in the foreseeable future is clear,\u201d said Bradley Duke, founder and chief strategy officer of crypto ETP provider ETC Group.\n\n\u201cWith Blackrock filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the US, given their past success rate, the belief is that this application is likely to be approved. This will enable massive pent-up demand for Bitcoin in the US and elsewhere to finally be able to flow into the market, and it\u2019s logical that the price of Bitcoin responds in a proportionate manner,\u201d said Duke.\n\nBitcoin supply inflow will also be further reduced by the token\u2019s fourth halving event, expected to occur in April or May 2024, which would cut miners\u2019 reward for mining new blocks and verifying transactions by 50%.\n\n\u201cPrior halving cycles have resulted in significant industry consolidation. This drives down the average cost of production further, increasing average miner profitability,\u201d the report said.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Standard Chartered\u2019s prediction is contingent on the premise that Bitcoin miners will be able to reduce the amount of freshly mined Bitcoin they put up for sale. The rationale for this thesis hinges on Bitcoin halving, an in-built feature of the Bitcoin network which cuts the reward miners receive for verifying transactions on the blockchain by 50% approximately every four years. Consequently, this event reduces the inflow of new Bitcoins into the economy. The latest halving event in May 2020 cut miner compensation to 6.25 Bitcoins per block. The next anticipated halving in April or May 2024 will further decrease miners\u2019 earnings to 3.125 Bitcoins per block. Historically, each four-year halving cycle has ushered in a new record high for Bitcoin, often succeeded by a downturn. The inaugural halving in November 2012 paved the way for Bitcoin to rise past US$1,200 in 2013. But this was short-lived due to a hack in Mt. Gox hack, the largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time. In the subsequent years before the next halving, Bitcoin price fluctuated between US$200-700, according to CoinMarketCap data. The second halving cycle, initiated in July 2016, saw Bitcoin set a new peak over US$19,000, a growth of around 1,500% compared to the prior record, propelled by the \u201cinitial coin offering boom,\u201d a period from when the popularity and usage of ICOs as a fundraising mechanism in the cryptocurrency space significantly increased. However, within a year of this meteoric rise, Bitcoin retraced to around US$3,200. The most recent halving cycle that started in May 2020 saw institutional entities such as Tesla and MicroStrategy bolster their Bitcoin holdings, powering the cryptocurrency to over US$69,000, roughly 250% more than its previous record. Bitcoin then declined to under US$16,000, following a series of negative incidents in the Web3 industry, notably the failure of the Terra-Luna stablecoin and the controversy surrounding FTX. The cryptocurrency traded at US$30,404 at press time. In light of this, Standard Chartered\u2019s price prediction of US$120,000 for Bitcoin would see a rise of about 74% from the previous peak. While it\u2019s observed that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility decreases with each halving cycle, this also impacts Bitcoin\u2019s profitability. As a result, investors remain on the lookout for the next big innovation in the blockchain space, akin to the surge of interest in decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens in recent years.\n\n2. Refreshing new lows\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast Labs umbrella.\n\nAfter another week of declines, the NFT market has found a new low of 2,703.44. The Forkast 500 NFT Index lost 2.33%, while the ETH Composite declined 1.75%, Solana slipped 0.54%, Polygon inched down 0.37% and Cardano gained 0.86%.\n\nBlockchain sales volume shows Ethereum losing 13% to US$88,912,031 in sales, Bitcoin rising 13%, Solana declining 75.5%, Binance gaining 55.8%, and Polygon falling 29.75%.\n\nNoteworthy seven-day floor price changes include Moonbirds, Yuga Labs\u2019 HV-MTL, BAYC and CryptoPunks that all posted double-digit gains, while The Captainz and Nakamigos posted double-digit declines.\n\nAverage global sales prices across blockchains declined 32% to US$68.52 from US$99.42 in the previous week.\n\nSeven-day global sales volumes decreased 20%, with US$163 million in sales this week compared to US$196 million last week.\n\nTrade profits in the previous two weeks stood at a low for 2023, with traders losing US$28.4 million.\n\nJuly 9 had 254,031 transactions, the lowest daily total since 239,742 on May 21.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? The NFT market had brief periods in the green over the past week, but the broader NFT ecosystem, after partial recoveries in specific projects\u2019s floor prices, remains on the downtrend since the market\u2019s peak on Jan. 17. This is a perfect way to highlight why floor prices are a poor measure of the value of the market. As the index reflects floor prices, the market\u2019s decline continues at the same rate prior to the Elementals mint. The decline in prices, global sales, trade profits, and individual daily transactions indicate that the NFT market still requires a catalyst to turn the ship around. That catalyst will need to be pretty monumental to turn around a market that has lost 46% of its value from its peak in January. While the established projects continue their declines, recent new mints found some success this week. Projects like a new Azuki derivative called Fatzuki, SMB Gen3 and Barrels, and Parallel Avatars each traded noteworthy volumes with US$1 million, US$2.9 million, and US$1.7 million, respectively.\n\n\n\nCollectors continue to demonstrate that they do not value established projects at the prices they currently command. However, collections priced closer to 0.1 ETH are another story. Affordable enough to engage in the hyped communities and still having potential financial upside, these newer collections are in a sweet spot that offers enough value for traders. Now we await established collections to fall to these prices so that these very same traders, and ideally brand new collectors, can return. This week, we also have a perfect example of why collections like Fatzuki, SMB, and Parallel Avatars are not included in the Forkast 500 NFT Index.\n\n\n\nLast month, a new collection called Ethscriptions emerged, allowing collectors to tokenize data for a fraction of the cost that you would pay to mint as a traditional NFT. Since early June, the collection of Ethscriptions has traded over US$1 million on secondary, largely from collectors trading the first 10,000 Ethscription collectibles, a collection that uses the CryptoPunks image, named Ethereum Punks.\n\n\n\nThis week Yuga Labs, who owns the CryptoPunks IP, requested that the Ethscription team remove Ethereum Punks from their website, and scrub any mention of them from Twitter. Prices are now decimated, with the rarest NFTs in the collection being listed on the floor, and leaving the collection essentially worthless. Consider the Ethereum Punks now dead and possibly Ethscriptions with it, but because the index only includes collections that are established for longer than six months, wild potential price swings will not impact the measurement of projects with more tangible value. On the horizon for the NFT ecosystem are some major projects\u2019 mints, Yuga Lab\u2019s Ape Fest 2023 announcement, and the end of Blur\u2019s season 2 of rewards farming.\n\n3. Buddy up\n\nContradicting recent reports, Sega revs up its blockchain engine through its partnership with Line. Image: Sega/Line\n\nSega Corp., the Japanese gaming giant behind hit IPs including Sonic the Hedgehog, will partner social media platform Line Corp. to bring one of its top game IPs onto the blockchain. The news on Monday came days after Sega was reported to be winding down its blockchain-based gaming business.\n\nSega signed a memorandum of understanding with Line Next Inc., an NFT branch of Line, to license the latter to make one of Sega\u2019s classic IPs into a Web3 game on Line\u2019s Game Dosi platform. The IP in question has not been confirmed for the time being.\n\nGame Dosi is Line\u2019s Web3 gaming platform launched on May 18. Line Next will support the NFT production, digital payments, and marketing activities of the Sega title when it launches on Game Dosi, according to the announcement.\n\nDays before the announcement, Bloomberg reported Sega would withhold its classic franchises from third-party blockchain-based gaming projects and pause its own plans for similar projects, citing an interview with Sega co-Chief Operating Officer Shuji Utsumi.\n\nHowever, Utsumi later said in an email response to Forkast that the company\u2019s strategy around blockchain had been misconstrued, and the plans to invest in Web3 projects, which includes licensing the company\u2019s certain game titles to blockchain-based developers that it trusts to maintain its quality standards and meet the expectations of fans.\n\n\u201cWe are not trying to be a Web3 company,\u201d said Utsumi. Instead, Web3 technologies such as the blockchain and NFTs are \u201cfunctions\u201d that the company will continue to explore as a way to grow its business and expand the potential of its IPs, he said.\n\nThe partnership with Line is not Sega\u2019s first Web3 initiative. In September 2022, the firm announced a partnership with blockchain game developer Double Jump Tokyo and decentralized blockchain gaming platform Oasys to bring its digital card game IP Sangokushi Taisen onto the blockchain. Meanwhile, other Japanese gaming companies, including Square Enix and Konami are also expanding in the Web3 space."

        "content": "Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize many industries, but scalability remains a major challenge that must be addressed. The growth of user count and transaction volume continues to demand increased capacity from networks, leading to congestion and high fees on many popular blockchains, rendering them impractical for mass adoption in their current form.\n\nOne now-emerging solution to the scalability problem is being pioneered by Syscoin, an OG crypto project that has been around since 2013 quietly building for the endgame of crypto. The Syscoin team holds the original core values of blockchain\u2014first established by Satoshi Nakamoto\u2014near and dear to their hearts, and they aim to scale them to meet the demands of a global population.\n\nSyscoin is an open-source public project, protocol, and network that combines the best of both worlds from Bitcoin and Ethereum. It was the first blockchain to implement a proof of data availability (PoDA) solution on mainnet, making it a leading contender for the future of blockchain scalability. This approach involves using two separate blockchains in harmony, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One chain can be optimized for security and decentralization, while the other can be optimized for speed and scalability.\n\nThe Syscoin network also features a number of other innovations that make it well-suited for mass adoption. These include:\n\nMerged mining with Bitcoin: Syscoin is merge-mined with Bitcoin, which means that it shares Bitcoin\u2019s security without requiring any additional energy expenditure.\n\nRollux: Rollux is a layer-2 scaling solution that uses the industry\u2019s only layer-1 proof-of-data availability solution to achieve incredible speeds without sacrificing security and decentralization.\n\nCost-savings: Syscoin has achieved greater efficiency within its ecosystem because it has all been tailor-made by the same team, allowing them to offer more competitive, highly affordable cost-savings for users.\n\nOn June 28, Sycoin formally announced the launch of Rollux on mainnet, a major milestone in the project\u2019s history that delivers on its \u201cpromise of speed, decentralization, security, affordability, and scalability,\u201d according to CEO Jagdeep Sidhu.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nSyscoin provides the foundation for Rollux to shine\n\nSyscoin is a modular, dual-chain layer-1 that has been designed with security, decentralization, scalability, and interoperability in mind \u2014 doing so has resulted in the creation of a blockchain that could bring forth the metaverse, smart cities, and other core pillars of the future of technology.\n\nThe dual-chain layer-1 architecture of Syscoin provides incredible benefits that have built a strong foundation for developments like Rollux to be constructed upon, while also providing users with leading-edge tools of both primary blockchain paradigms (UTXO and EVM).\n\nSyscoin prioritizes developer flexibility while solving for security, network bloat, and speed | Source: Syscoin\n\nSyscoin solves the blockchain trilemma using the \u201cmost efficient negotiation\u201d with the least trade-offs, as outlined below:\n\nSecurity\n\nBy merge-mining, Syscoin lends greater utility to the Bitcoin network and further incentivizes miners while adding Bitcoin\u2019s leading security to the Syscoin network. The network is further safeguarded against attacks such as selfish mining through multi-quorum chainlocks. Miners and masternode operators are incentivized to contribute to the network by receiving rewards for providing valuable real-world services. Notably, merge-mining Syscoin with Bitcoin does not incur any additional energy costs.\n\nNetwork bloat\n\nSyscoin\u2019s modular architecture ensures scalability to cater to the needs of global mass adoption. It is specifically designed to optimize blockchain activity, resulting in ultra-efficiency and minimal data footprint. This design leads to increased capacity, higher throughput, and reduced costs across the board, especially with Layer 1 data availability.\n\nSpeed\n\nSyscoin offers a range of tools that ensure speedy asset and smart contract functioning at a minimal cost. These tools are compatible with both blockchain paradigms \u2013 Rollux for EVM-based assets or contracts, and Z-DAG for UTXO-based assets. This compatibility enhances the versatility of the system, as users can choose the best blockchain paradigm for their specific needs.\n\nRollux brings the vision of Syscoin to life\n\nRollux is the culmination of years of R&D, providing unprecedented scalability that sets the stage for mass adoption and the future of the Syscoin ecosystem. It uses layer-2 rollups and the industry\u2019s only layer-1 proof-of-data availability solution to achieve incredible speeds without sacrificing security and decentralization. Each transaction costs a small fraction of a cent, so any developer can cheaply scale their dapp.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nRollux ensures high levels of security and decentralization through merged mining with Bitcoin, making it the only major rollup to follow this strategy. Its arrival is a monumental event for the blockchain industry, as it effectively tackles the persistent blockchain trilemma, paving the way for future growth and mass adoption while retaining the core principles that underpin the value of blockchain.\n\nPrior to the mainnet launch of Rollux, and supplementing a wide selection of third-party dapps by partners, a cohort of incredible first-party projects from SYS Labs, the company behind Rollux, were already developing on it in order to provide a welcoming ecosystem for new users. Here are a few examples.\n\nLuxy\n\nLuxy is a Multichain NFT marketplace that allows users full functionality with NFTs (create, buy, sell, etc.), and also enables collection owners to set up automatic royalty distribution across stakeholders in the project.

        "title": "Demand is driving the price of Bitcoin to $130K - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In any market, whether it is fruit and vegetables or financial assets, prices are determined by the intersection of supply and demand.\n\nIf tomatoes are scarce due to a flood, with the same demand, the price in the supermarket will inevitably be higher \u2014 just as it will be higher if, with the same supply, twice as many people want to buy tomatoes.\n\nIn the financial market, if supply is unlimited, the price is not changed by demand, as in the case, for example, of a mutual fund.\n\nRelated: Don\u2019t be naive \u2014 BlackRock\u2019s ETF won\u2019t be bullish for Bitcoin\n\nIf more subscribers want to buy this fund, more shares are simply issued at something called net asset value (NAV) \u2014 that is, the correct value of the fund\u2019s assets.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s suppose a fund has a capitalization of $100 million, made up of 10 million units at a value of $10. If an investor wants to invest $10 million, 1 million units are issued at a value of $10, and the capitalization of the fund becomes $110 million.\n\nIt would be a different story if the shares available were limited to 10 million, so anyone who wanted to buy the shares would have to find someone willing to sell them. In that case, the price might no longer be $10, but it would depend on how much the buyer was willing to pay and how much the seller wanted to earn. It would create a situation in which the price fluctuated according to uneven supply and demand. If an asset was in high demand, obviously, the price could go much higher than the correct price.\n\nBut how can you estimate the correct price?\n\nIn 2021, I published data that attempted to estimate the fair value price of Bitcoin, illustrated in the graph below. It suggested that in June of that year, we had reached a relative maximum for Bitcoin (BTC). (I hoped at the time it would not prove true, but it did.) How had I estimated this value?\n\nThe previous fund example helps us understand the logic behind this estimation.\n\nIf the capitalization of a fund is given by the number of units outstanding multiplied by the NAV, or the price, it is also true that it could also be estimated as the number of investors in the fund per average amount held by each investor.\n\nSo, in the case of Bitcoin, if I would be able to estimate the average amount held in each wallet by\n\nthe number of wallets in circulation, I can also estimate the capitalization of the Bitcoin and, consequently, by dividing by the number of Bitcoin in circulation, derive its price.\n\nLuckily for us, the transparency offered by the blockchain allows us to collect much of this information with a high degree of reliability. For example, the number of Bitcoin addresses with a balance different than zero can be easily tracked just by running a network node.\n\nAs can be seen from the graph, the average amount (United States dollars) in wallets fluctuates due to supply and demand (many wallets hold Bitcoin without ever moving it), so if we take the 90th percentile and the 10th percentile, we can find a range that can lead us to subsequently estimate the price of Bitcoin.\n\nNow, once the growth curve (on a logarithmic scale) of the wallets in circulation has been estimated, it is possible to estimate a range within which the price of Bitcoin should move.\n\nThis model is simple, but the simplicity is its strength: we do not know if a user owns different addresses or if a single address is \u201cowned\u201d by multiple users \u2014 as in the case of the cold wallet of an exchange \u2014 but we can rely on these relationships especially when compared in terms of large numbers and on a time horizon of a complete price cycle.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: Even worse for crypto than central exchanges\n\nFor example, in the last days of a crypto winter \u2014 like in recent months \u2014 typically, we can detect an increase in withdrawals from crypto exchanges and a reduction in balances held in these centralized platforms. Since keeping crypto assets in third-party custody is usually considered more dangerous, this signal is considered bullish since it shows the preference for investors to hold a long Bitcoin position in the long term rather than holding it in a trading account to take advantage of short-term speculative opportunities.\n\nThis phenomenon is therefore accompanied by an increase of addresses (withdrawal from a few cumulative cold wallets to fill many single addresses controlled by individual persons) and lays the foundations for a cyclical price appreciation also based on the model described in this article.\n\nData from this graph and this model indicate the price of Bitcoin could reach its next ceiling in autumn 2025 at $130,000 \u2014 and possibly higher.\n\nAs always, it is important to note that this forecast is not financial advice. It can only be taken as an expected value based on some assumption with a certain degree of confidence. But similar price growth estimates also emerge from other predictive models. The recent surge of interest in this asset class among institutional players like BlackRock \u2014 the largest asset manager in the world, which is seeking approval for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund \u2014 may indicate that they place some faith in these models.\n\nDaniele Bernardi is the founder of Diaman, a group dedicated to the development of profitable investment strategies.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\n\n\nAn investor\u2019s note from Bernstein note that MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC strategy comes with risk.\n\nMicroStrategy holds over 150,000 BTC used as collateral for loans.\n\nAn extreme market crash could pressure the company to sell if it has to fulfill debt obligations.\n\nAn investor\u2019s note from private wealth management firm Bernstein has unpacked a potential scenario that would force MicroStrategy to sell some of its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe business intelligence firm has been converting most of its corporate treasury to Bitcoin (BTC) in a move led by CEO Michael Saylor over the past two years. The company holds over 150,000 BTC, valued at $4.5 billion, of which some tokens have been used as collateral for loans.\n\nAccording to Bernstein\u2019s note, which has grabbed headlines, MicroStrategy plans to continue raising debt into the future, which could lead to a potential scenario where it would have to liquidate its BTC holdings. This would require \u201cextreme price corrections\u201d coinciding with the company\u2019s debt expiry in 2025.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would see the value of MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC holdings fall below its debt obligations. This would lead to its corporate structure coming under pressure from \u2018spring forward\u2019 clauses.\n\n\u201c2028 due debt does have liquidity covenants which could spring forward the debt to 2025/26\u201d, the report added.\n\nAdopting Bitcoin\n\nMicroStrategy is somewhat of a trailblazer for the institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Saylor initiated the firm\u2019s BTC acquisition strategy after announcing the company would convert its treasury to Bitcoin in 2020.\n\nThe company would go on a spree of Bitcoin investing, starting with a $250 million buy order for 21,454 BTC in August 2020. The company now holds over 152,000 BTC as of July 2023, valued at $4.5 billion at an average price of $29,600.\n\nMicroStrategy also announced a $1.05 billion loan in February 2021 that matures in 2027 that it used to continue its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. This is part of the debt the company is carrying that could lead to a potential sell-off scenario which Bernstein has highlighted.\n\nWould MicroStrategy Crash Bitcoin Price?\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin holdings are significant for a single entity and exceed the 142,000 BTC owed to creditors of the infamous, defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox.\n\nAs CCN previously explored, there has been similar speculation about the potential impact of the return of the 142,000 BTC to former Mt. Gox\u2019s users and whether that amount of liquidity would drive Bitcoin\u2019s value down.\n\nQuantum Economics founder and seasoned cryptocurrency market analyst Mati Greenspan said that the value of Mt. Gox\u2019s BTC is not even as significant as daily trading volumes:\n\n\u201cDaily on-chain volumes are at an average of $12 billion, and exchange volumes are reportedly in the neighborhood of $18 billion per day. So this is certainly something the market can absorb in a relatively short time frame.\u201d\n\nWhile the comments were aimed at Mt. Gox creditors BTC holdings, the fairly similar value provides a good measuring of what would transpire if MicroStrategy were to sell some BTC."

        "content": "Eurex\u2019s new FTSE Bitcoin Index Futures contracts can help investors remove regulatory uncertainty from their crypto investments\n\nEurex\u2019s new FTSE Bitcoin Index Futures contracts can help investors remove regulatory uncertainty from their crypto investments\n\nAs jurisdictions worldwide continue to grapple with how best to provide regulatory clarity for trading digital assets, traditional exchanges are stepping up to provide investors with ways to gain bitcoin exposure, without being left vulnerable.\n\nEvents of the past year \u2013 which resulted in losses across crypto and traditional finance \u2013 highlighted that where you trade is just as important as what you trade.\n\nOne year ago, it wouldn\u2019t have been unusual for crypto investors to trade on an unregulated platform \u2013 based in an offshore jurisdiction \u2013 offering integrated market\u2011making, clearing, custody and even borrowing/lending services. Now, however, investors have become more cautious.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Eurex, Europe\u2019s leading derivatives exchange, partnered with leading global index provider FTSE Russell and institutional-grade crypto market data provider Digital Asset Research (DAR) to launch futures on the FTSE Bitcoin Index in EUR and USD. The new futures contracts provide investors with a solution to gain cryptocurrency exposure through a safe and trusted framework.\n\n\u201cThe high-profile bankruptcies of 2022 prompted market participants to re-evaluate how they\u2019re approaching crypto markets, who they want to interact with and the level of transparency they want over trading operations,\u201d says Rafael Zanatta, crypto and equity index sales, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, at Eurex. \u201cMany firms within the ecosystem were not focused on counterparty risk, as the market operates without the same amount of regulation and risk management controls currently present in traditional finance markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving a centrally cleared product in a familiar jurisdiction is an increasingly attractive proposition to the institutions we spoke to, so we created a product to meet that demand,\u201d adds Nicolae Raulet, crypto derivatives product manager at Eurex. \u201cIt was for the same reason we opted for a cash\u2011settled contract with an established benchmark regulation [BMR]-compliant index.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur aim in launching FTSE Bitcoin Index Futures at Eurex was to give investors the option to trade through a regulated venue in a trusted jurisdiction with the same risk management systems that operate in asset classes such as equities and fixed income\u201d Rafael Zanatta, Eurex\n\n\n\nSeamless access to crypto\n\nAs investors well know, the crypto product landscape is diverse and dynamic. Products come and go at a fast pace, which requires a lot of diligence on the part of the investor \u2013 legal advice to understand the prospectus where available, alongside technical advice around replication, collateral, risk and insurance, to name a few. However, listed derivatives products, such as Eurex\u2019s FTSE Bitcoin Index Futures, operate under the same umbrella as equity index futures at the exchange, which means investors have clarity and certainty on how these contracts behave under various circumstances.\n\nThe underlying FTSE Bitcoin Index reflects the settlement price of bitcoin as determined by the FTSE DAR Reference Price. Liquidity is supported by order book and over-the-counter (OTC) liquidity providers. The contracts, launched on April 17, represent a major milestone in the exchange\u2019s ambitions to offer safe and trusted access to cryptocurrencies in a regulated market environment.\n\nThe contracts were designed to cater to a wide range of global investors, offering a one\u2011bitcoin multiplier. Initial margins are around 25%. The cash\u2011settled contracts trade 21 hours a day, Monday to Friday and settle at 17:00 CET on the last Friday of the month. AA rated central counterparty Eurex Clearing manages all trades, thereby minimising counterparty risk and adding an additional layer of security.\n\nEurex\u2019s FTSE Bitcoin Index Futures adhere to Europe\u2019s BMR and have regulatory approval from Germany\u2019s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority.\n\nGiven the strong regulatory framework under which futures exchanges operate, many investors view listed derivatives as the safest way to add bitcoin to a portfolio.\n\n\u201cMarket participants that directly invest into cryptocurrencies have to hold the assets in cold or hot wallets, via custody providers or self\u2011custody \u2013 but holding the assets comes with risks: risk of hacks, risk of losing or forgetting your private key and the risk of counterparty default \u2013 basically, the investor holds the entire risk,\u201d says Zanatta.\n\nWith an index futures product such as Eurex\u2019s, these risks are eliminated: investors buy exposure to bitcoin \u2013 not bitcoin itself \u2013 and that exposure is guaranteed through a central clearing mechanism. \u201cBy design, crypto-listed index futures follow the exact same setup as any other index-based futures contract. The investor can take a view on where bitcoin will go, but then leaves the complexities of trading and the underlying hedging with the specialist firms that will make that bridge between the two worlds and offer you the price for such exposure,\u201d explains Raulet. \u201cMoreover, through Eurex, investors can gain exposure via existing trading accounts without the need for costly additional infrastructure setup.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe clearing house backs our index futures contract, and you receive your cash settlement on expiry. You don\u2019t need to worry about who the asset\u2019s custodian is or about anyone lending your collateral, and there is no management fee either,\u201d adds Zanatta. \u201cInstitutional investors already know how such contracts look and work, so it\u2019s a simple option for those looking to diversify their portfolios.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy design, crypto-listed index futures follow the exact same setup as any other index-based futures contract\u201d Nicolae Raulet, Eurex\n\nGrowth opportunities\n\nAs the first European exchange to offer bitcoin index futures, Eurex understands that bitcoin liquidity is currently concentrated outside of the European time zones. The exchange sees this as an opportunity to develop a European liquidity pool for bitcoin futures. \u201cAlthough our futures contracts are available worldwide, our customers have lamented they have had difficulty getting significant trades done during European hours. We want to change that,\u201d says Zanatta.\n\nRecently, the Eurex FTSE Bitcoin Index Futures also received approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Trading for US\u2011based investors began on May 29, 2023. US investors can now trade these contracts directly on Eurex and benefit from trading and hedging opportunities.\n\nEurex has a growing number of liquidity providers streaming prices on-screen, as well as committed participants for block trade liquidity. \u201cWhat has been interesting about the types of providers we have is that they are traditional exchange members, rather than crypto natives. They\u2019re active in the various asset classes we offer, but also have specialised crypto desks connected to crypto spot markets,\u201d says Zanatta.\n\n\u201cWe also have interest from crypto-native firms that understand how several investors prefer to trade with the safeguards and guarantees of a regulated exchange, rather than OTC,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cThe plan for the next few months is to build average daily volume for both the EUR- and USD-denominated contracts, and to introduce options on the same indexes. These too will comprise all the benefits available with the futures contracts \u2013 namely, a way to gain exposure to bitcoin through a safe and trusted framework,\u201d says Raulet.\n\nThe index rule book has strict vetting criteria that FTSE Russell and DAR apply to determine the list of participating exchanges. It also has clear rules on eligibility, or loss thereof, from exchanges contributing to the price. \u201cWe are in close dialogue with our partners at FTSE on the constantly evolving landscape of crypto spot markets, and trust their strong governance and reputation to apply their rule books, and observe all appropriate restrictions that may impact particular crypto exchanges,\u201d adds Raulet."

        "content": "This July 14 Bitcoin weekly options expiry holds the potential to be a significant turning point for market sentiment, potentially leading to a breach below the crucial $30,000 support level.\n\nDespite the initial bullish surge triggered by the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) requests, the recent macroeconomic data has not been favorable for risk-on assets.\n\nAnalyzing market sentiment is crucial in assessing the chances of Bitcoin (BTC) holding above $30,000 by July 14. This level acts as a threshold that could provide bears with a perfect opportunity to profit up to $120 million through the weekly option expiry.\n\nFalling U.S. inflation is detrimental to Bitcoin in the short term\n\nIn June, the Consumer Price Index in the United States registered at 3.0%, the lowest level since March 2021. This was primarily due to a 16.7% decline in the energy index. While this indicates a slowdown in inflation, it remains above the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2%, which is detrimental to Bitcoin, as higher interest rates incentivize investors to pivot into fixed-income investments.\n\nOne could argue that, in the short term, the lowering of inflation reflects a successful intervention by the Fed and could be viewed as a positive factor for Bitcoin\u2019s bullish momentum. However, on July 12, the U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the dollar\u2019s strength against major foreign currencies, reached its lowest level in 14 months.\n\nIn essence, investors\u2019 confidence in the Fed\u2019s ability to prevent a recession seems to be waning. Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel suggested that the U.S. economy is \u201cprogressing smoothly,\u201d with consumers seemingly unaffected by higher borrowing costs. However, Siegel believes that consumers are currently utilizing the last of their cash reserves for travel and enjoying the summer.\n\nETF approval odds decreased after remarks from the SEC\n\nThe most compelling argument for the bulls to support further gains and sustain Bitcoin's trading price above $31,000 on July 14 lies in the potential approval of the spot ETF. However, recent statements by Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have been unfavorable.\n\nGensler noted on July 12 that crypto exchanges often offer conflicting services, including trading directly against their own clients. Furthermore, he cautioned about the limited risk monitoring practices employed by crypto platforms, leaving them vulnerable to market manipulation, such as wash trading.\n\nOver the years, the SEC has rejected multiple requests for spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing significant pricing occurring on unregulated trading platforms. The regulator has also expressed concerns about the ability of ETF providers to protect investors from fraudulent and manipulative acts.\n\nBearish instruments were outnumbered but better positioned\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price traded above $31,000 on July 4, fueling bullish bets by traders using options contracts. Another failed attempt to break the resistance on July 6 explains why bulls have concentrated their bets on Bitcoin prices trading above $31,000.\n\nDeribit Bitcoin options aggregate open interest for July 14. Source: Deribit\n\nThe 0.53 put-to-call ratio reflects the difference in open interest between the $470 million call (buy) options and the $250 million put (sell) options. However, the outcome will be lower than the $720 million total open interest since the bulls were overconfident.\n\nFor example, if Bitcoin\u2019s price trades at $30,500 at 8:00 am UTC on July 14, only $30 million worth of call options will be accounted for. This distinction arises from the fact that the right to purchase Bitcoin at $31,000 or $32,000 becomes invalid if BTC trades below those levels upon expiration.\n\nRelated: First Bitcoin futures contract debuts in Argentina\n\nBitcoin bears can flip the tables and bag a $120 million profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on July 14 for call (buy) and put (sell) instruments varies depending on the expiration price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $28,000 and $30,000: 200 calls vs. 4,100 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $120 million.\n\n200 calls vs. 4,100 puts. The net result favors the put (sell) instruments by $120 million. Between $30,000 and $31,000: 1,000 calls vs. 1,100 puts. The net result is balanced between the call and put instruments.\n\n1,000 calls vs. 1,100 puts. The net result is balanced between the call and put instruments. Between $31,000 and $32,000: 4,200 calls vs. 200 puts. The net result favors the call (buy) instruments by $125 million.\n\n4,200 calls vs. 200 puts. The net result favors the call (buy) instruments by $125 million. Between $32,000 and $33,000: 6,400 calls vs. 0 puts. The net result favors the call (buy) instruments by $210 million.\n\nTaking into account the latest macroeconomic data that supports more interest rate hikes and Gensler\u2019s negative comments about exchanges\u2019 ability to provide the basis for a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, bears have an opportunity to break below the $30,000 price support and secure a $120 million profit during the upcoming weekly options expiry.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Several large investment managers have recently submitted applications to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale Investments has been trying to launch a spot bitcoin ETF since 2016 and has yet to get approval. Now, its calling out the Securities and Exchange Commission over its approval of a leveraged bitcoin futures ETF. Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein joints Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his company's efforts to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right, Bitcoin has soared over the last month on hopes that regulators are going to finally approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. We're looking at gains of just about almost 17% in the price of Bitcoin getting a boost after BlackRock filed paperwork with the SEC last month sparking a new wave of optimism and several institutions followed.\n\nWhile Grayscale has been trying to get approval for a spot market ETF since 2016, its last request was denied. Now the company is calling out the SEC. For more on this, we want to bring in Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale Investments CEO.\n\nMichael, it's great to see you. And I want to bring up the letter that you recently sent. And we have a full screen here to show exactly what you are laying out. You sent a letter to the DC Court of Appeals questioning the SEC's decision to approve a leveraged Bitcoin future ETF after previously denying a spot Bitcoin ETF. So lay out your case here and why these two decisions don't add up.\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Absolutely. Well, it's great to be back on the show. I would say that this really comes down to the core argument. When the SEC denied our application to convert GBTC into an ETF, we immediately filed a lawsuit challenging that decision.\n\nAnd the argument that really underpins that is that the SEC has approved, not one, but several Bitcoin futures-based ETFs-- futures are a derivative of that underlying spot market-- but continued to deny, including GBTC, spot Bitcoin applications from coming to market.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd those arguments were presented to the court. We believe that they're common sense and compelling arguments. But the SEC now has gone on and continued to even go further into this arbitrary behavior by now approving a leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF which, in the actual prospectus itself, outlines that that's an even riskier product, right?\n\nAnd so we do feel here that investors should have choice, right? They should be able to use Bitcoin futures ETFs. They should be able to use spot Bitcoin ETFs, really whatever's going to fit their mandate as an investor.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Michael, why do you think the SEC has been so reluctant. I mean, what's your read on what is driving or what's motivating the SEC to put the brake?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, I can really only point to what they've said in their denials, right? The SEC has been looking for a market that is surveyable, a market that maybe has the qualities and characteristics of other markets that they're used to seeing.\n\nThat being said, there are new conversations being had around surveillance-sharing agreements and other types of constructs that maybe the SEC will be persuaded by, but time, I think, will tell.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Michael, many though are looking at the approval of the leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF as a positive step forward given the fact that then maybe this makes it a little bit more likely that the SEC is going to approve a Bitcoin spot ETF, do you share in that view?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Well, I think there's been a recent wave of ETF applications that have come in and part of that optimism really does revolve around the GBTC lawsuit. We've been transparent with the market that we expect a decision from the court sometime. It could be as soon as over the next few weeks, but probably by the fall the latest.\n\nAnd so there's a lot of issuers that have been looking at-- Not only has GBTC kind of laid the groundwork and become a place where many investors have gotten their Bitcoin exposure, but it's now the framework upon which they're basing their operations, their disclosure, et cetera. So they believe that that, in fact, could be a catalyst if a favorable outcome is reached, there.\n\nAnd it continues to show that investor interest and appetite for this asset class isn't going away and the continuation of Bitcoin futures, Bitcoin-leveraged futures ETFs, these are all additional access points that investors now have.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Michael, it's been what? More than eight months now since we saw really just the collapse of FTX. And there were a lot of concerns, conversations around that time about what the future of crypto will look like.\n\nI mean, you've got institutional names now trying to get in with the spot Bitcoin ETF and really the opportunity is there as well. But what do you think has evolved in the thinking within the crypto space and does that ultimately strengthen the case for investment into something like Bitcoin?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: You know, it's great to think about that timeline in perspective, because you're right. It was only six, eight months ago that the narrative around crypto was that it was being left for dead or it was a passing fad or investors were fleeing it. And what we've said is it's actually quite the opposite.\n\nYou know, this is my and Grayscale's third crypto winter. And we've continued to reiterate. It's a great time to build. And it's a time when crypto gets challenged and really demonstrates its resiliency. And so you've seen continued optimism, additional institutional investors coming to the space.\n\nAnd assets like Bitcoin are some of the highest returning assets of the year. And so it really does show the staying power of the asset class and that additional narrative from some of these incumbent legacy financial institutions is a really important construct for investors to keep in mind as well.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Michael, we do see the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF. How much of-- is that a game changer here for the industry just in terms of wider adoption and given the fact that many investors, you would think, want maybe some exposure to crypto, but they're more comfortable going that ETF route?\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Exactly. I think the ETF wrapper is a tried-and-true product model that investors are used to for commodities, segments of the market, et cetera. And I think all of the issuers filing know there's a lot of pent-up demand.\n\nAnd so whether you're looking at GBTC or any of the other products looking to come to market, there are trillions of dollars on the sideline-- even just in the financial advisor market-- that are looking for a convenient solution to give their clients exposure to Bitcoin, so we do think it could be a material moment for Bitcoin to say the least.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: OK. To be continued there. Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein, good to have you on today.\n\nMICHAEL SONNENSHEIN: Thank you."

        "content": "In the latest episode of The Market Report, Cointelegraph analyst and writer Marcel Pechman discusses Standard Chartered bank\u2019s $120,000 Bitcoin price expectation based on the halving impact. According to the report, increased miner profitability due to a pre-halving rally would \u201creduce the net BTC supply.\u201d\n\nPechman, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t acknowledge the thesis, given that the mining difficulty will continue to increase and the news confirming Riot Platform\u2019s investment in new ASIC equipment. In fact, the mining difficulty increased by 73% in the last 12 months, while the Bitcoin (BTC) price increased by 58%.\n\nRegarding the $50,000 Bitcoin year-end price prediction, Pechman believes the number is too optimistic, given the low odds of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval by then. However, if the ETF is approved within the next six months, an estimated $5 billion potential inflow could catapult Bitcoin\u2019s price above $70,000.\n\nFor 2024, Pechman increases his odds of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval to 30%, while Bloomberg analysts expect even higher chances at 50%. Given the sheer size of BlackRock and Fidelity, Pechman believes a $10 billion inflow in the first couple of months following the ETF launch is feasible, suggesting Standard Chartered\u2019s $120,000 expectation could be on the conservative side.\n\nThe expectation of an ETF approval may impact the pre-halving rally, according to Pechman, who also explains why investors may be anticipating the movement. Consequently, the pre-halving effect may get longer or shorter if investors dump before the event happens. Pechman\u2019s recommendation is to avoid the fear of missing out or FOMO. If you missed an entry spot, traders should either wait for the dollar cost average or sit and wait.\n\nLastly, Pechman analyzes the latest Glassnode on-chain analysis report on re-accumulation at $30,000. According to Pechman, \u201creturn to mean\u201d is also widespread in traditional markets. When investors are lost without the necessary conviction to move the price, they will refer to the previous two-year or three-year average levels.\n\nTo hear more about Pechman\u2019s strategy for the Bitcoin halving and the impact of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, listen to The Market Report, exclusively on the new Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space."

        "title": "Bitcoin mining difficulty hits all-time high as BTC miner selling peaks - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining difficulty reached an all-time high of 53.91 trillion units after the latest difficulty adjustment on July 12. It is a measure of how difficult it is to mine Bitcoin (BTC) blocks.\n\nThe blockchain adjusts its difficulty every two weeks to maintain its processing time of 10 minutes. When the network\u2019s processing power increases, it adjusts to make mining challenging, reducing the profitability for individual miners.\n\nThe latest adjustment will add to the pressure on miners, who have been selling off their mined BTC since June. Some analysts suspect that the lack of miner accumulation has likely restricted an uptrend in the BTC price.\n\nWith the latest difficulty adjustment, the profitability of medium- and small-scale miners will likely drop into negative territory, forcing them to temporarily turn off some of their ASIC hardware.\n\nThe potential capitulation of weaker miners could finally enable larger miners to accumulate Bitcoin, which may reduce the mining selling pressure.\n\nAre miners close to capitulation?\n\nThe hash ribbon indicator, created by independent analyst Charles Edwards, tracks the 30- and 60-day moving averages (MAs) of the network\u2019s hash rate. When the 30-day MA falls below the 60-day MA, it is a signal that miner capitulation may be occurring, meaning unprofitable miners are moving out.\n\nThe two lines are marginally close to a crossover, and the increase in difficulty may finally provide the catalyst for the capitulation of weaker miners.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart with the hash ribbon indicator. Source: TradingView\n\nThe exodus of weaker miners would bring more rewards for the more efficient miners, potentially allowing them to save a portion of their output instead of selling.\n\nCan Bitcoin push higher after miner selling ceases?\n\nRecently, miners were seen unloading record amounts of BTC to exchanges. According to a K33 Research report, publicly listed miners sold 100% or more of their output in May.\n\nMonthly updates on Bitcoin sold by public miners in 2022. Source: K33 Research\n\nIn June and July, as well, the 30-day cumulative transfer volume of BTC from miner wallets to exchanges spiked to a six-year peak, suggesting that miners likely continued to unload their Bitcoin at an alarming rate.\n\n30-day cumulative volumes of BTC transferred from miners to exchanges. Source: Bitcoin Magazine\n\nThe one-hop supply of miners from Coin Metrics, which represents the total amount held in wallets that received coins from mining pools, also dipped to one-year lows. It shows that miners have been uploading more coins than their production output.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin\u2019s pre-halving rally may start soon \u2014 Here\u2019s why\n\nOne-hop supply of miners. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nWhile miners have resorted to selling, the supply distribution data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment shows that Bitcoin whales did the opposite.\n\nThe most prolific BTC investors, often known as whales and sharks and marked by addresses holding between 10 to 10,000 BTC, have increased their holdings by $2.15 billion since June 17.\n\nOn top of that, Bitcoin held by exchanges has fallen below 2017 levels, suggesting that investors are moving the BTC off exchanges and that Bitcoin's illiquid supply is growing.\n\nWhile the accumulation of Bitcoin among whales has previously pushed the price of BTC higher, this time, it has remained suppressed in a narrow range between $29,500 and $31,500, which could partially be due to miner selling pressure.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Europe\u2019s first spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) is set to debut later this year after a long delay. The Bitcoin ETF by Jacobi Asset Management \u2014 a London-based multi-asset investment platform \u2014 was set to debut on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange in July 2022.\n\nHowever, unprecedented market conditions caused by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022, as well as the FTX collapse in November, forced the asset manager to postpone the listing. The Jacobi Bitcoin ETF received approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) to launch its Bitcoin ETF in October 2021.\n\nThe asset manager told the Financial Times that it has decided to launch the ETF now because it has seen a gradual shift in demand compared with 2022. The asset manager told Cointelegraph that it is still assessing the launch and will share a date soon.\n\nThe Jacobi Bitcoin ETF is a centrally cleared crypto-backed financial instrument with custody supported by Fidelity Digital Assets, a major shift from the usual exchange-traded notes (ETNs). In Europe, all crypto-backed traditional financial instruments were structured as ETNs, rather than funds.\n\nThe major difference between an ETN and an ETF is that the ETF shareholder owns a portion of the fund\u2019s underlying assets, while ETN investors own debt security. ETFs, unlike ETNs, cannot be leveraged or use derivatives, which could otherwise lead to market manipulation risks.\n\nRelated: Grayscale resolves lawsuit with Fir Tree over proposed changes to Bitcoin Trust\n\nWhile Europe approved its first spot Bitcoin ETF in October 2021, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected all spot Bitcoin ETFs to date. However, in 2023 alone, nearly half a dozen institutional giants, including the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity, have filed fresh spot Bitcoin ETF applications in hopes of becoming the first U.S approved spot BTC ETF.

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin All Popped on the Ripple Ruling - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nThe crypto market was on fire on Thursday afternoon after a judge ruled that Ripple (XRP 0.07%) is not a security (in most cases).\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been in a battle against cryptocurrencies this year, but the first case to actually make it to court and nearly to trial is the SEC's suit against Ripple, which was filed in December 2020. There are still questions about how this applies to other tokens and whether the ruling will hold up, but for now, it's a huge win for the industry.\n\nAltcoins are popping the most today, but the big tokens are making nice gains as well. Bitcoin (BTC 0.05%) is up 4.7% in the last 24 hours as of 4 p.m. ET, Ethereum (ETH -1.55%) has risen 7.1%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 9.09%) is up 7%.\n\nSo what\n\nThe judge's ruling concluded that Ripple was a security when it was sold to institutional investors, who they said were speculating on an asset that they would then sell. But it was not a security on the secondary market because a buyer or seller on the secondary market had no way of knowing who was getting their money.\n\nIt's hard to say that this fully clarifies what is and isn't a security in the crypto industry, and it's likely the ruling will be appealed, but for now, the secondary sale of cryptocurrencies appears to be legal. This should help the ongoing trading of existing tokens, and Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are clear leaders from a market capitalization standpoint.\n\nWhile the secondary trading of cryptocurrencies is legal -- according to this ruling -- the initial sales to institutional investors may not be. That question will go to trial, but that will include hedge funds and venture funds that bought these assets. And it's not even clear how that trial will turn out.\n\nNow what\n\nCrypto investors have been looking for some kind of clarity in the U.S. and clearly jumped on it today. However, this is only a district court ruling, and it's the first of many potential rulings. The SEC continues to go after Coinbase (COIN -1.72%), in particular, and dozens of tokens are involved in that case.\n\nI do think this will push both the courts and lawmakers to act to bring even more clarity to the market. Taking loss after loss in court isn't a good look, and almost everyone in the industry is pushing for clarity about what is and isn't a security in the digital world.\n\nThis clarity could be good for the value of Bitcoin and Dogecoin, which right now are viewed largely as stores of value or speculative assets, which seem to pass regulatory muster, at least in the secondary market. Ethereum may benefit both from secondary trading and clarity over what can be built with NFTs or other blockchain tools.\n\nAt least for today, the crypto market is cheering a judge's ruling, but with the ups and downs we have seen the last few years, the cheering might not last for very long."

        "content": "Bitcoin surged on Friday morning in Asia to breach the US$31,000 resistance level, after Ripple Labs achieved a partial victory in its three-year lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulator accused Ripple of offering XRP as an unregistered security. Along with Bitcoin, Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged considerable gains, with XRP spearheading the rally with a rise of over 70%. U.S. equity futures traded flat in the Asia time zone on Friday as investors await earnings reports from major U.S. banks. Thursday\u2019s U.S. producer price index (PPI) has added to a sense that inflation is slowing in the country.\n\nXRP ruling provides crypto market boost\n\nBitcoin climbed 3.45% over the last 24 hours to US$31,463 as of 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly gain of 4.93%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached a high of US$31,814 early Friday morning, the highest price since June 2022.\n\nIn a summary judgement on Thursday, New York Southern District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple\u2019s programmatic sales of the XRP token on public exchanges do not constitute securities, marking a partial victory for Ripple with the SEC. The regulator first sued the San Francisco-based financial technology firm on the grounds that XRP constitutes a security in 2020.\n\nThe verdict came with a critical caveat, however. The court ruled that Ripple\u2019s XRP sales to institutional investors did violate securities laws.\n\nNonetheless, Ripple\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Stuart Alderoty called the judgement \u201ca huge win\u201d in a Friday tweet.\n\nA huge win today \u2013 as a matter of law \u2013 XRP is not a security. Also a matter of law \u2013 sales on exchanges are not securities. Sales by executives are not securities. Other XRP distributions \u2013 to developers, to charities, to employees are not securities. \u2014 Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) July 13, 2023\n\nAlderoty said that \u201cthe only thing the Court found constitutes an investment contract is past direct XRP sales to institutional clients.\u201d Those transactions will now be subject to further court proceedings.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the overall optimism in the crypto community evidenced by the upswing in the market, there are also a number of industry voices sounding a note of caution.\n\nIn an emailed comment, CoinShares\u2019 Head of Product Townsend Lansing said that the aspect of the ruling that identifies Ripple\u2019s sales to institutional customers as a violation of securities law marks \u201ca considerable victory for the SEC.\u201d\n\nThe ruling will now set a precedent for legal action against other cryptocurrencies by regulators, he said.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that institutional investors who purchased directly from Ripple may find themselves subject to class-action litigation as potential underwriters,\u201d Lansing added. \u201cThis is an area to watch closely, especially if big-name venture capitalists were involved.\u201d\n\nBut, while some sense of jeopardy remained for those involved, Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock, believes that the ruling had at least \u201cshook investors in the best of ways.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Europe\u2019s first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is set for a public listing this month. That follows a 12-month delay from the initially planned date, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.\n\nExperts have identified the listing as another potential catalyst for the crypto market.\n\n\u201cWith the talks of ETFs in the background, the idea that we could see products tracking many cryptocurrencies is not implausible and traders are naturally positioning themselves accordingly,\u201d said Keyrock\u2019s d\u2019Anethan.\n\nLike Bitcoin, Ether surged 6.99% to US$2,004, moving up 7.69% for the week. The token is trading above US$2,000 for the first time since April.\n\nBoosted by the ruling on the SEC-Ripple case, all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies rose in the past 24 hours. Cardano\u2019s ADA, Solana\u2019s SOL and Polygon\u2019s MATIC each logged two-digit gains.\n\nXRP, subject of the SEC\u2019s lawsuit against issuer Ripple, jumped 72.75% to US$0.8142 and added 74.89% for the week. In doing so, it replaced Binance\u2019s BNB as the third largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 6.19% in the past 24 hours to US$1.26 trillion, while trading volume jumped 95.72% to US$60.3 billion.\n\nForkast 500 up, Dapper Labs announces layoffs\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.14% in the past 24 hours to 2,699.39 as of 09:55 a.m. in Hong Kong. Forkast\u2019s Solana and Cardano NFT market indices also moved higher, while the Etheum and Polygon indices dropped.\n\nDespite the overnight rise in cryptocurrency prices associated with the Ripple ruling, total NFT sales volume dipped 1.72% in the past 24 hours to US$24.45 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nAmong all NFT collections, Bitcoin-based $FRAM BRC-20 NFTs topped the 24-hour sales volume, edging up 0.31% to US$2.14 million. In doing so, it recorded over two thirds of the total volume on the Bitcoin network. Ethereum-based collections Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and the Captainz ranked second and third respectively.\n\nBAYC #1734, part of the BAYC collection, topped collectible sales in the past 24 hours. It was sold at 600 Ether (US$1.2 million) early Friday. As exciting as this big sale is, BAYC #1734 was previously sold at 800 Ether in January 2022.\n\n\u201cThis grail Bored Ape was sold at a huge loss, but the takeaway is that there is still a market for very high-priced NFTs, even in a bear market,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nAs the bear market continues, Dapper Labs, the developer of hit NFT collections such as CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot, announced the layoff of 51 staff on Thursday \u2014 roughly 12% of its workforce.\n\n\u201cThe decision was incredibly difficult\u201d but necessary to \u201censure a lean and efficient\u201d company, said Dapper Labs Chief Executive Officer Roham Gharegozlou in a letter to employees. It is the third round of layoffs at the company in the past 12 months. Those layoffs saw its workforce cut by 22% in November 2022 and by a further 20% in February this year.\n\nCool Cats Group, the Web3 company behind NFT collection Cool Cats, announced a partnership with game developer nWayPlay, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based software and investment giant Animoca Brands. Together, the two companies will develop a Web3 game set to be released between late 2023 and early 2024.\n\nUS equities flat amid data releases\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat as of 11:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. All three major U.S. indexes closed higher in regular Thursday trading, with the Nasdaq leading the gains with a 1.58% rise.\n\nThe U.S. producer price index (PPI) released Thursday recorded a 0.1% year-on-year rise for the month of June, down from 0.9% in May. The June figure is the smallest increase since August 2020.\n\nThe data is also well below analyst expectations of a 0.4% annual increase in PPI. Combined with weak consumer price index data released on Wednesday, the data points to a slowdown in U.S. inflation.\n\n\u201cThe better-than-expected inflation figures for June 2023 would suggest that policy is working to ease price pressures as higher interest rates reduce demand. Key payroll figures announced in early July also came in below expectations with the economy generating less jobs than expected in June,\u201d said Keith Wade, chief economist & strategist at asset management Schroders.\n\nHowever, given lingering inflation worries, Wade still expects the Federal Reserve to make another interest rate hike in July. The tight labor market and the potential for a reversal in the Fed\u2019s monetary policy could, Wade said, trigger a rally in the bond market that would \u201cloosen financial conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the efforts the Fed has made to convince markets they were serious about inflation and not about to pivot, this would seem to be too early,\u201d said Wade.\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said in a Thursday speech that the Fed would need to \u201ckeep policy restrictive for some time\u201d in order to reduce inflation below its 2% target. He said that he anticipates two more rate hikes by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cI am more confident that the banking turmoil is not going to result in a significant problem for the economy, and I see no reason why the first of those two hikes should not occur at our meeting later this month,\u201d said Waller.\n\nMeanwhile, a Wednesday report by financial comparison service company Bankrate showed that economists believe there is a 59% chance the U.S. economy will enter a recession inside the next twelve months. The report cited concern about the long-term economic impact of this year\u2019s extended series of rate hikes.\n\nThe 59% figure is, however, a decrease on the 64% chance given in April, and the lowest level in the past 12 months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets on July 26 to discuss its next move on rates, which now sit between 5% and 5.25%. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 92.4% chance the Fed will enact a 25-basis-point rate increase this month, and a 7.6% chance it will leave the rate unchanged.\n\nInvestors are now awaiting the release of second-quarter earnings reports from major financial institutions on Friday. The releases will include reports from JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, BlackRock and more.\n\nElsewhere, main stock indexes across Asia traded higher on Friday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, Japan\u2019s Nikkei and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all posted rises as of 12:30 p.m. in Hong Kong.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

They knew everything about Bloom, from her profession to the number of children she had.\n\n\n\nDemanding thousands of dollars of so-called bond money, Bloom frantically got out of bed and obeyed the demands of the callers.\n\n\n\nBut it was all a lie.\n\nBloom was the target of a careful, thought-out AI scam designed cheat her out of her own money.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe call came from the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office,\u201d Bloom said.\n\n\n\nScammers, however, are able to spoof phone numbers to appear as legitimate contacts when calling someone.\n\n\n\nThe call was found to be an imposter scam, the most reported fraud category in Iowa, according to the FTC.

European bourses and U.S. stock futures gained while Asian equities traded mixed.\n\nSee related article: Gamers can now earn Bitcoin rewards on Minecraft via Zebedee\n\nTop 10 cryptos trade mixed\n\nBitcoin gained 0.62% to US$30,741 in 24 hours to 4.05 p.m. in Hong Kong, but lost 0.06% on the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. In the same period, the market capitalization of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency also inched up 0.57% to US$597 billion, while its trading volume declined 21.12% to US$11.87 billion. The token touched a high of US$$30,831 in the past 24 hours.\n\n\u201cBTC [Bitcoin] is seen to be consolidating between US$29,800 \u2013 US$31,200 in the last three weeks. A breakout either way is very likely in the coming days as July awaits several macro events, [including] the U.S. Consumer Price Index and the U.S. Producer Price Index this week followed by the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision in the last week of July,\u201d Minal Thukral, executive vice-president of growth and strategy at CoinDCX, India\u2019s first crypto unicorn, told Forkast in an emailed response on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe can expect volatility coming in the second half of July with the upcoming events and BTC mostly staying range bound since last week,\u201d Thukral added.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank on Monday projected Bitcoin prices would reach US$50,000 by the end of 2023 and US$120,000 in 2024.\n\n\u201cHistorically, Bitcoin halving has proven to be the biggest driver for the start of a bull run as this happens every four years where the supply for Bitcoin reduces by 50%, increasing demand which leads to price rise,\u201d Thukral said.\n\nThe next halving is scheduled for April next year, with the pre-halving buildup already reflecting the Bitcoin price increase.\n\nBitcoin prices also received a boost after several traditional finance (TradFi) companies, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco and Bitwise, filed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the U.S. last month.\n\n\u201cAlthough the approval is still pending with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, if approved this will make it easier for mass adoption for users,\u201d Thukral said.\n\n\u201cOver-the-counter (OTC) trading reached a one-year high in June, surging by 60% in the past quarter alone. These OTC trading deals are now more popular with institutional investors, indicating BTC is becoming a preferred investment option,\u201d he added.\n\nDigital asset and fintech investment firm Fineqia said on Wednesday that its analysis of global exchange traded products (ETPs) with digital assets as underlying collateral, has expanded by 76% in assets under management (AUM) year-to-date amid renewed interest by investors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an upward trend so far this year, and that\u2019s attracting capital,\u201d Fineqia chief executive Bundeep Singh Rangar said in an emailed statement. \u201cRecent ETF filings in the U.S. signals a revival of interest among financial institutions.\u201d\n\nEther, the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency, gained 0.35% to US$1,889 in the past 24 hours, but dropped 2.38% on the week.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with BNB \u2013 the native token of world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange Binance \u2013 gaining the most. BNB rose 1% to US$249 in the past 24 hours and gained 2.64% on the week.\n\nKTX.Finance, a decentralized perpetuals exchange on BNB Chain, said on Tuesday it has raised US$4 million seed round financing led by Hashed. Other participants in the round include AlphaLab Capital, CRIT Ventures, KuCoin Ventures, among others. KTX.Finance \u2013 incubated by ByteTrade Lab \u2013 went live last month on BNB Chain and said it has achieved US$40 million in trading volume from more than 600 traders.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 0.66% to US$1.2 trillion while market volume decreased 19.9% to US$26.45 billion in the past 24 hours.\n\nNew Ethereum-based collections gain\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.04% to 2,704.29 in 24 hours to 6.25 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 2.6%.\n\nIn the same period, the Forkast ETH NFT Composite slipped 0.1% to 929.15, after losing 1.51% on the week.\n\nTotal sales volume on Ethereum declined 5.41% to US$14.98 million while those on the Bitcoin network fell 41.61% to US$3.12 million in the past 24 hours, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nBy collection, the Bitcoin-based $FRAM BRC-20 NFTs topped the list but fell 12.57% to US$1.84 million. Parallel Avatars, an Ethereum-based NFT collection for Web3 sci-fi game Parallel, launched on July 11, ranked second with its sales volume rising 94.77% to US$1.59 million.\n\nStation3 Patron, another newly-launched Ethereum NFT collection, ranked fifth with its 24-hour sales volume rising 71.32% to US$902,779.\n\n\u201cAmong the current use cases of NFT, while collectibles is still finding its feet, there are other use cases that show more sticky traction. Sorare NFTs are used as part of game play (fantasy sports) and have shown considerable sticky volumes and traction,\u201d said Thukral of CoinDCX.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. is cracking down on NFT scams. Moroccan national Soufiane Oulahyane has been indicted by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York for allegedly creating a lookalike of NFT marketplace OpenSea to obtain unauthorized access to cryptocurrency and NFTs. In September 2021, Oulahyane stole approximately US$450,000 worth of cryptocurrency and NFTs from a victim in Manhattan, according to a Monday statement by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nU.S. stock futures, European bourses gain; Asian equities mixed\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAsian equity markets were mixed on Wednesday, ahead of the highly-anticipated U.S. consumer price index report due later on Wednesday that is expected to offer some relief on the need for further rate hikes.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite, Shenzhen Component and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 dropped on Wednesday while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index gained.\n\nU.S. stock futures strengthened as of 8 p.m. in Hong Kong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 Futures all in the green.\n\nAnnual inflation in the U.S. is expected to slow to 3.1% in June, the lowest since March 2021. The June inflation, along with the producer price data due on Thursday, will give insight into what could be the Federal Reserve\u2019s next move on interest rates.\n\nSeveral Fed officials said on Monday that more interest rate hikes may be needed to bring the annual inflation rate below 2%. However, there were also those who noted that an end to the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening cycle is in sight.\n\nThe central bank will meet on July 26 to discuss its next move on rates, which are currently between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nU.S. financial giants including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and BlackRock will also release their second-quarter earnings later this week to kick off the reporting season.\n\nEuropean bourses gained on Wednesday ahead of the latest U.S. inflation data announcement. The benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 rose during Wednesday afternoon trading hours in Europe.\n\n(updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency payment industry continues to evolve with a new cryptocurrency payment option coming to crypto-friendly Telegram messenger.\n\nWallet, a Telegram bot allowing users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), has launched a crypto payment solution based on The Open Network (TON) blockchain.\n\nThe new Wallet Pay service provides crypto payment transactions between users and retail businesses, enabling direct payments within the Telegram interface.\n\nAnnouncing the news on July 13, Wallet told Cointelegraph that the new payment feature is immediately available within all jurisdictions supported by the wallet service.\n\nAt the moment, this list of supported jurisdictions supported by Wallet Pay includes most countries except for the United States and those blacklisted by the Financial Action Task Force, a spokesperson for Wallet said. For example, Wallet Pay doesn\u2019t serve countries like Iran, Myanmar and North Korea.\n\nAs some countries of Wallet bot\u2019s operation do not allow residents to pay using cryptocurrency, the wallet service puts compliance responsibility on local businesses. The Wallet representative stated:\n\n\u201cBusinesses should decide if they are allowed to do business within their jurisdiction before applying to make use of Wallet Pay.\u201d\n\nThe list of jurisdictions that do not allow their residents to pay for products and services with crypto includes countries like Russia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Iran, Egypt and others. Russia, which officially banned domestic crypto payments in 2020, is the second-biggest country in terms of Telegram downloads after India, according to data from Statista. Indonesia, Egypt and Vietnam are also among the top 10 countries of Telegram app downloads.\n\nTop 10 countries by Telegram app downloads. Source: Statista\n\nWallet Pay\u2019s representative noted that the platform isn\u2019t aware of what merchants would be first to test out its payment feature because the firm hasn\u2019t launched the Know Your Business (KYB) procedure yet. The spokesperson said:\n\n\u201cWe have had a few hundred requests collected by our support team, but we did not start the KYB procedure with these requests prior to launch, so we don\u2019t yet know who will be the first to implement the feature.\u201d\n\nThe representative also stressed that the firm runs its operations independently from Telegram. The Wallet bot and application are based on the Telegram Web Apps open protocol, which allows developers to create their own apps and services on Telegram.\n\nThe payment service is available through a dedicated Telegram bot or the official Wallet Pay website. Users should be careful to ensure they validate the source of the bot if they consider trying it.\n\nRelated: Tourists are unhappy with crypto payments ban in Bali\n\nWallet\u2019s new payment feature supports three cryptocurrencies that are currently featured on its wallet service. These cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Tether (USDT) and Toncoin (TON).\n\nUnlike self-custodial or noncustodial wallets like MetaMask, the Telegram Wallet bot operates a custodial wallet with its own fee structure.\n\n\u201cAs of today, Wallet is a custodial solution,\u201d the spokesperson told Cointelegraph. The representative added that fees for crypto payments will \u201crange from 1% to 3% during the beta period.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Wallet Support data, the Telegram Wallet bot also currently takes a 0.0004 BTC ($12) commission for withdrawing the cryptocurrency from its custodial wallet. USDT and TON\u2019s withdrawal fees amount to 2 USDT and 0.05 TON, respectively.\n\nMagazine: Asia Express: China expands CBDC\u2019s tentacles, Malaysia is HK\u2019s new crypto rival"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBig-time financial institutions\u2019 involvement in Bitcoin solidifies crypto\u2019s position as a valid investment\n\nBlackRock was never supposed to be the first spot ETF\n\nWas it really all about transparency or was the SEC just not sure about Bitcoin?\n\nCrypto, specifically Bitcoin, has been around since its inception in 2009. People have traded back and forth using the token, whether to buy pizza or services over the internet. For the longest time, regulating bodies didn\u2019t take the technology and its potential seriously.\n\nBitcoin In The Government\u2019s Crosshairs\n\nGovernments started to take Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seriously when users started utilizing them for purposes that were deemed unfavorable. Whether it was cases in which crypto was used to purchase illegal substances or others in which financial entities would evade taxes.\n\nThings, however, took a serious turn when crypto-run businesses started causing damage to the financial wellbeing of citizens and governments alike. The FTX collapse really caught the attention of regulators at a whole new scale, simply because it caused billions of dollars in losses.\n\nEver since, regulators have been extra strict on the industry, going on the offensive against any private organization that may pose the threat of creating an FTX-like situation. While Terra\u2019s and Celsius\u2018s collapses did occur, causing even more billions of dollars in damage, regulating bodies have stayed vigilant and somewhat aggressive against crypto.\n\nWall Street Loans Credibility To Bitcoin\n\nNow, crypto, most specifically Bitcoin, is witnessing a phoenix-like revival due to corporate interest. The involvement of major financial corporations such as BlackRock, ARK, and Fidelity in crypto brings the promise of governmental and private regulation of the market.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin now has a better chance to receive a green light to grow and increase in utility as a payment option. So, as the trend goes, Bitcoin is looking optimistic in both value and regulation.\n\nNot Wall Street\u2019s First Attempt At Crypto\n\nWay before BlackRock, Fidelity, and co, Grayscale Investments had the crypto market to itself. Establishing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the company manages $19.1 billion in assets.\n\nInterestingly, Grayscale filed to convert GBTC to an ETF in partnership with the New York Stock Exchange. However, after stalling for a long time, the SEC rejected Grayscale\u2019s application last June, citing that the proposal lacked sufficient anti-fraud guarantees.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision was questioned not only by Grayscale but also by other governmental entities . Following the news, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC on the matter, yet no solid decision was taken thus far.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC, Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein celebrated the emergence of financial institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity in the crypto space.\n\n\u201cTo see literally the largest asset manager in the world publicly commit to advancing their crypto efforts only lends validity to the asset class and the staying power that it has,\u201d said Sonnenshein.\n\nThe Grayscale CEO is perhaps more optimistic about his company\u2019s ETF application now that BlackRock and co seem to be on their way to getting SEC\u2019s approval.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re successful in that challenge there\u2019s actually billions of dollars in investor capital that would be unlocked through that.\u201d\n\nWill Bitcoin Stay \u201cDecentralized\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s fair to start looking at Bitcoin optimistically as an option for investment, as signs are showing toward a more stable future for the token. It\u2019s equally fair to assume that Bitcoin will likely increase in value in the future following Wall Street\u2019s involvement in the market.\n\nIt is somewhat fair to also assume that Bitcoin will fall under a lot more restrictions as such corporations will continue to build their own fortifications to avoid potential collapses on their investments.\n\nWith that in mind, the token that was once celebrated for being so decentralized people used it to buy pizzas online, is likely to be regulated by the same powers that controlled the traditional financial world that led people toward decentralized tokens in the first place. On top of that, regulating bodies are likely to add more regulatory constraints to tokens such as Bitcoin, effectively treating it as any other TradFi investment."

        "content": "Argentina welcomed its first Bitcoin futures contract on July 13, just three months after the country\u2019s securities watchdog approved the underlying index as part of a strategic innovation agenda.\n\nAccording to Matba Rofex, the trading platform behind the investment vehicle, it is the first Bitcoin (BTC) futures contract in Latin America. In a futures contract, buyers bet on the future price of a commodity or other asset, such as Bitcoin. Under the contract, buyers and sellers are obligated to purchase and sell the asset at a predetermined future date.\n\nArgentina\u2019s securities regulator, the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Valores, approved the Bitcoin futures index in April as part of an innovative agenda to encourage public-private collaboration for new financial products.\n\nThe Bitcoin futures contract will be based on the price of BTC quoted by several market participants providing BTC/ARS trading pairs. All trades will be settled with Argentine pesos, and traders are required to make deposits through bank transfers.\n\nAccording to local media reports, the product will initially be available only to institutional investors. There\u2019s no clear timeline for when retail investors can trade Bitcoin futures contracts in the country. With the futures index, qualified investors can gain BTC exposure in a transparent, regulated environment.\n\nArgentinians have turned to Bitcoin to keep pace with hyperinflation in the country. Argentina\u2019s annual inflation rate soared 114% in May from a 108% jump in April 2023, hitting the highest level since 1991, according to Trading Economics.\n\nArgentina annual inflation rate. Source: Trading Economics\n\nAnother Bitcoin futures contract should be soon available in the region, as regulators in Brazil are evaluating a similar investment vehicle backed by the local stock exchange B3. Initially scheduled to debut on June 30, the crypto futures contract is now expected to go live on Sept. 30. This is the second time the product release has been delayed.\n\nBitcoin futures premiums reached their highest level in 18 months on July 4, jumping 3.2% from the previous week. With the surge in BTC derivatives demand, traders question whether the market is experiencing \u201cexcessive excitement\u201d or is returning to normal after a prolonged bear market, Cointelegraph reported.\n\nMagazine: $3.4B of Bitcoin in a popcorn tin \u2014 The Silk Road hacker\u2019s story"

        "title": "No, Bitcoin Ordinals Do Not Inscribe Data Onto Sats - Nasdaq",
        "content": "This is an opinion editorial by Bitcoms, a Bitcoin writer.\n\n\u201cSo quick bright things come to confusion\u201d \u2013William Shakespeare, \u201cA Midsummer Night's Dream\u201d\n\n\u201cInscriptions\u201d are a way of writing pieces of arbitrary information onto the Bitcoin blockchain. \u201cOrdinals\u201d are a convention used for tracking individual sats and linking them to inscriptions. This article does not attempt to argue for or against Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions. Rather, it argues against the confusing, inaccurate and sometimes dubious ways they can be presented, marketed and sold.\n\nIt deals with a widespread fallacy which insinuates that ownership of Ordinal inscriptions is enforced and protected by the rules of the Bitcoin protocol itself (I maintain that it is not). And while this fallacy may be asserted duplicitously or innocently, it is always pernicious because it can make Ordinal inscriptions more attractive to prospective buyers.\n\nHere is a typical example:\n\n\u201cOrdinals allow a variety of data, including text, images, and video to be inscribed on a single Satoshi (the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin) and permanently stored on the Bitcoin blockchain.\u201d \u2013Introduction documentation for Ordinals Market\n\nThis suggests that ownership of an inscription will be protected by the permanence and immutability of the Bitcoin timechain itself. But Bitcoin does not enforce ownership of inscriptions, because an inscription is not \u201cinscribed on a single satoshi\u201d on the blockchain at all.\n\nAs the \u201cOrdinal Theory Handbook,\u201d the guide to Ordinal theory compiled by its developers, points out:\n\n\u201cSatoshis live in outputs\u201d while \u201cinscription content is included in transaction witnesses.\u201d\n\nWhile both output data and witness data are stored on the Bitcoin blockchain following the SegWit upgrade, claiming that inscription data is inextricably linked to an \"inscribed\" satoshi creates a misleading notion that any such link is recognized by Bitcoin itself.\n\nIn reality, the link between an inscription and a specific satoshi is manufactured off chain by a purpose-built external indexer. This pulls data from the Bitcoin blockchain and presents it according to an elegant but ultimately centralized and arbitrary system of rules called \u201cOrdinal theory.\u201d These rules are entirely extraneous to the Bitcoin protocol itself, and have been described by their originator as akin to astrology.\n\nSpread Of The Inscription Fallacy\n\nBut in my view, statements in many of the places where Ordinal inscriptions can be created, viewed, bought and sold, as well in media coverage, do not explain the role of the Ordinal indexer clearly enough. Thus, the idea that inscriptions are embedded \u201conto\u201d or directly \u201cinto\u201d satoshis, and that the inscription data and a corresponding sat are inextricably linked within the Bitcoin protocol without the need for an external indexer, has created a dangerous fallacy for potential investors.\n\nHere are just a few examples of such statements:\n\n\u201cOrdinal Inscriptions, similar to NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin.\u201d \u2013Ordinals.hiro.so\n\n\u201c...Ordinals are \u2018inscribed\u2019 onto a single satoshi\u2026 Inscribing is the process of putting a piece of data onto the blockchain, where it will remain forever accessible and unchangeable.\u201d \u2013\u201cCoinbase Bytes\u201d newsletter\n\n\u201cEach sat can be inscribed with data, such as JPGs, GIFs, PDFs and more, creating a Bitcoin Ordinal which is then held in a wallet.\u201d \u2013Gamma FAQ\n\n\u201cWhat are Bitcoin Ordinals? Launched in Jan 2023, they allow the creation of NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain by attaching data to individual satoshis using a process called inscription.\u201d \u2013Binance NFT Twitter account\n\n\u201cFor the uninitiated, Ordinal Inscriptions, akin to NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on satoshis (the smallest currency unit of bitcoin).\u201d \u2013CoinDesk\n\n\u201cOrdinals inscribe a serial number onto a satoshi, the smallest currency unit of bitcoin.\u201d \u2013CoinDesk\n\n\u201cOrdinals are inscribed directly onto individual Satoshi\u2019s, which are then included in blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain.\u201d \u2013Nairametrics\n\n\u201c\u2026bitcoin network upgrades \u2026 enabled each satoshi \u2026 to store a few megabytes of data, from text and images to audio and video.\u201d \u2013Reuters\n\n\u201cToken functions \u2026 are all achieved by inscribing data into satoshis, the smallest divisible unit of a bitcoin.\u201d \u2013NYDIG newsletter\n\nAs stated at the outset, this article does not seek to show that Ordinal inscriptions are good or bad. It simply spotlights the misleading, sometimes sloppy, and perhaps at times scammy, ways they are being presented, which wrongly implies that Bitcoin itself will enforce inscription ownership without the use of an external tool.\n\nSo, what can be done to make sure potential buyers of Ordinal inscriptions do not fall victim to this fallacy? We can keep clearing up confusion by pointing it out.\n\nThis is a guest post by Bitcoms.

        "title": "Bitcoin Dominance is Over 50% \u2014 Four Things That Fueled Confidence in BTC - Markets Insider",
        "content": "Initiating the era of digital assets comes with a few perks that Bitcoin (BTC-USD), the original cryptocurrency, enjoyed for quite a while. Market dominance was one of them, and, seen as a safe haven on multiple market cycles, BTC enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of above 50% of the market until the competition -the rest of the crypto ecosystem- picked up.\n\nBitcoin dominance is often associated with stability across the crypto market, where investments are directed toward the original cryptocurrency and investors\u2019 trust in BTC is high. So, it\u2019s no coincidence that BTC slipped below 50% dominance mere weeks before the Terra ecosystem meltdown in April 2021 and stayed between 40%-50% levels while the crypto market endured the Celsius, 3AC, and FTX collapses.\n\nNow, after two years of tumultuous market activity, Bitcoin has steadily increased its market share since the start of 2023 and crossed 50% dominance in June, bringing BTC\u2019s market cap above all the rest of the cryptocurrency industry combined. Here\u2019s why.\n\n#1. No BTC Mention in SEC vs. Binance and Coinbase Lawsuits\n\nThe Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against leading cryptocurrency exchanges Binance (BNB-USD) and Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) last month. The allegations revolved around the accusation that these crypto exchanges offered various altcoins as unregistered securities. Should the SEC\u2019s lawsuit prove successful, altcoins may face increased regulation and shift towards offshore and decentralized trading.\n\nThe lawsuit didn\u2019t mention the two largest cryptocurrencies, BTC and Ethereum (ETH-USD). As a result, Bitcoin dominance has seen a surge as the case caused investors to relocate their investments from altcoins to Bitcoin, turning it into a safe haven once again.\n\n#2. Blackrock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe world\u2019s-biggest asset manager with $9 trillion under management, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), recently filed for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), an investment vehicle that tracks the value of an underlying asset. The SEC has previously rejected several spot ETF applications, stating concerns about Bitcoin price manipulation as the reason. Nevertheless, the approval doesn\u2019t seem far away, as BlackRock has an ETF approval rating of 99.83%, and the application includes a surveillance-sharing agreement that could eliminate the risk of market manipulation.\n\nEric Balchunas, the senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, called the prospective BlackRock Bitcoin ETF \u201cthe real deal,\u201d stating it isn\u2019t much different from GLD, the \u200b\u200bSPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD), which tracks the price of gold by holding physical gold bullion in its portfolio. Reflexivity Research co-founder Will Clemente exemplified GLD\u2019s huge bull run, which started with its launch, as a potential price action for BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF.\n\n#3: Buy the Rumor: Fidelity\u2019s Crypto Action\n\nMining Bitcoin since 2014, Fidelity, the world\u2019s third-largest asset manager, with $4.24 trillion under management, is also rumored to be planning an impactful move in the cryptocurrency markets. It is suggested that the firm is expected to make a buyout bid for Grayscale, the fund manager controlling the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC), and/or launch its own spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nFor years, Grayscale has been trying to convert the GBTC to a spot Bitcoin ETF. The conversion request has been denied by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which led to Grayscale suing the agency in June 2022, claiming the regulator was acting arbitrarily in rejection of spot Bitcoin ETFs, despite having previously approved Bitcoin Futures ETFs.\n\n#4: Bitcoin Innovation Ramps Up\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s price action was the highlight for some time, developers never really stopped exploring the infrastructure of the original blockchain. After a privacy update in 2021 enabled data storage on the Bitcoin network, Ordinal inscriptions resembling NFTs started showing up on the same infrastructure.\n\nAlbeit controversial, Bitcoin Ordinals showed clearly that there\u2019s still much left to discover in Bitcoin in terms of innovation and pushing for new horizons.\n\nAnother front for Bitcoin-driven innovation was discovered when Stanford University professor David Ts\u00e8 and his team\u2019s research revealed a \u201cnatural synergy\u201d between Bitcoin and Proof-of-Stake (PoS), the mechanic that\u2019s mainly used by the Ethereum-based DeFi ecosystem, emphasizing that developers can focus on building applications using Bitcoin\u2019s unmatched liquidity pool.\n\nInstead of the vast network of miners maintaining the Bitcoin blockchain, PoS-based blockchains are driven by the staking mechanism. Cosmos-based blockchain Babylon (where professor Ts\u00e8 serves as CTO) aims to find an ideal middle ground between Bitcoin and the DeFi world by utilizing the former as a timestamping service to provide better security for important transactions and censorship resistance.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent resurgence to over 50% market dominance bolstered investor confidence in the asset as a safe haven. While it can be tied to multiple factors, what\u2019s more important is what lies ahead. The ETF filings by the world\u2019s largest wealth managers indicate retail investors are not alone in trusting Bitcoin. Coupled with the expanding innovation, Bitcoin has the potential to welcome a new massive wave of adoption.\n\nDisclosure"

        "content": "The year 2023 has so far seen Bitcoin mining companies exceed the performance of the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC). The cryptocurrency is up about 84% so far this year (as of Jul 10, 2023).\n\nMeanwhile, Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF WGMI, Crypto Industry Innovators ETF BITQ, Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF SATO and Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITS added about 244.8%, 172.2%, 161.4% and 124.8%, respectively, so far this year (as of Jul 10, 2023).\n\nThis divergence in price performance is primarily attributed to a less-hawkish Fed which helped growth stocks like bitcoin miners. Increased transaction fees, prominent issuers\u2019 interest in launching a bitcoin ETF also acted as drivers in boosting those stocks. If these were not enough, the leveraged beta effect, which tends to boost mining stocks more than the underlying asset, played a key role.\n\nHowever, the likelihood of interest rate hikes left investors wondering if mining stocks can maintain their upward trajectory in the second half of the year. Let\u2019s delve a little deeper.\n\nFears of Higher Rates Weigh on Crypto Stocks\n\nThe Fed's efforts to curb inflation through interest rate hikes have caused uncertainties for high-risk assets like digital currencies. In past one week, bitcoin remained almost flat. While this decline may be a short-term correction, a resilient U.S. labor market strengthens rate hike expectations, alarming Bitcoin's future.\n\nWhat Are Silver Linings?\n\nBlackrock, WisdomTree and Invesco Plan to Launch Bitcoin ETFs: The filing of spot ETF applications by renowned asset managers fueled a growing interest in cryptocurrencies from institutional and corporate clients. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been in denial for a Bitcoin ETF for long, the filings represent a significant step towards widespread adoption. The world\u2019s largest asset manager BlackRock\u2019s plans to launch a bitcoin ETF in June influenced the entire space. Two other large investment firms now joined the queue, WisdomTree and Invesco.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraditional Finance Giants Explore Crypto Space: Renowned financial institutions, including Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Citadel Securities, have partnered to launch EDX Markets, a crypto exchange platform. EDX Markets, which had faced delays due to regulatory uncertainty, has finally listed major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nInstitutional Adoption: Institutions such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, which were against virtual currencies before, have started implementing them into their systems. This is a sign of growing acceptance among institutional investors.\n\nFavorable Regulations in the Cards?Though the SEC\u2019s stance toward cryptocurrency has been adverse so far, back-to-back efforts in launching an ETF from reported issuers stirred speculation that such intuitional initiatives might compel legislative institutions to figure out how to classify and regulate them.\n\nPositive Outlook for Bitcoin Mining Companies: Bitcoin mining stocks are well-positioned for growth. Mining companies have been making expansion moves, increasing their hash rates, and planning to acquire more mining machines. Such companies include Hut 8 Mining, Riot Platforms and Cleanspark. In fact, bitcoin hash rate hit a new all-time high amid weakening prices.\n\nBitcoin Having Expected in 2024: Halving events, which occur about every four years, lower the mining rewards by half. The resulting shortage of newly mined BTC has historically played a crucial role in driving price rallies. As the having event looms in 2024, traders are tightening their belts for a new cycle. So, there is high chance of an upward momentum for Bitcoin.\n\nCheaper Valuation: Last year, bitcoin was thrashed as rising rates weighed on speculative and growth investments. This has helped the crypto block to bounce back with all force.\n\nSustainability Parameter: Cryptocurrencies are being promoted as an eco-friendlier investment. Sustainability concerns are in vogue lately as the global investing world is concerned about climate change.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Despite these setbacks, Argo is enhancing its total hash rate capacity and signals a stronger outlook for the future.\n\nArgo Blockchain\u2019s Bitcoin Production Falls in June\n\nIn June 2023, Argo mined 139 Bitcoin or Bitcoin Equivalents, averaging 4.6 BTC daily. This represents a decrease of 17% from the 5.6 BTC mined each day in May 2023. During the previous month, the total number of tokens mined was 173 BTC.\n\nJune\u2019s decline is attributed to increased network difficulty and a scale-down of operations at the Helios facility in Texas. While this curtailment limited the number of Bitcoin mined, Argo anticipates additional cash inflows from specific power trading activities that Helios' operator previously undertook.\n\nThe Company's revenue in June totalled $3.84 million, marking a drop of 19% from May 2023's figure of $4.75 million.\n\nKeep Reading South Africa Navigates Crypto Regulations: To License 60 Firms This Month\n\nDespite declining production and revenue over the past month, ARGO shares on Wall Street are at relatively high levels. The company tested the April highs during yesterday\u2019s (Tuesday\u2019s) session, closing the day at almost $30 per share.\n\nSource: Yahoo Finance\n\nEnhancements to Hash Rate Capacity\n\nAs noted on 30 June, Argo held 44 BTC. The firm maintained its total hash rate capacity at 2.5 EH/s and began to equip its Quebec facilities with new BlockMiner machines. Once fully operational, these machines are projected to boost the company's total hash rate capacity by 12%, raising it to roughly 2.8 EH/s.\n\nDespite the short-term challenges reflected in the report in June, the company's efforts to bolster its mining capacity underline a strategic response to an increasingly competitive cryptocurrency mining landscape.\n\nCryptocurrency Winter Hurt the Company\n\nUnaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2023 from Argo Blockchain were published last month. Argo reported a significant boost in revenue in Q1 2023, which saw an increase of 15% from the fourth quarter of 2022, totalling $11.4 million. Regardless of this growth and an adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 million, the company sustained a net loss of $8.7 million.\n\nWhat is more, the company's 2022 financials revealed a contrasting picture. The publicly-listed mining firm reported a year-end revenue of $58.6 million, marking a substantial decline of 36%. The year saw the company suffering a net loss of $240.2 million. This situation is primarily influenced by the falling value of cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies By using cryptography, virtual currencies, known as cryptocurrencies, are nearly counterfeit-proof digital currencies that are built on blockchain technology.

After a record-breaking 2021, they earned $6 billion less, which was mainly due to the ever-increasing difficulty of mining.\n\nArgo appears to be regaining stability even with the adverse net results. Despite the threat of bankruptcy, a decisive agreement with Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., a finance company with expertise in digital assets, successfully averted the impending closure and set Argo back on track."

Discover SCENE\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) discount shrank to its lowest level in a year, hitting 26.7% of its NAV on July 6.\n\nThe amelioration comes amid a wave of exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the U.S. and the settlement of a lawsuit against one of its shareholders.\n\nOne GBTC represents the smallest unit of Bitcoin held by a U.S.-based trust. Currently, it holds BTC worth $19.07 billion. GBTC was last trading at a discount of 27.8% on the price of spot Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe GBTC shares have traded at a discount to Bitcoin\u2019s market value since February 2021, reaching lows of nearly 50% in December 2022.\n\nThe primary reason for the discount in GBTC is that it is a closed-end fund, which means that investors cannot redeem GBTC for the underlying Bitcoin, making it challenging to track the fair market price and reducing its demand.\n\nThere are several alternative investment products like ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which closely tracks BTC price and has seen increasing demand since its launch last year.\n\nGBTC also charges an annual management fee of 2%, which slowly eats into the principal value.\n\nGrayscale: ETF or redemptions\n\nGrayscale has attempted to convert its trust fund into an ETF to enable redemptions at Bitcoin\u2019s market price, however, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has denied approval so far.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe firm sued the SEC to contest SEC\u2019s rejection in court. The verdict of the lawsuit is expected to arrive this fall.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF filing on June 16 revived the market\u2019s hope around an ETF approval, with hopes that approval could come for Grayscale too.\n\nThe GBTC discount dropped from around 44% before BlockRock\u2019s filling to 26.7% in less than a month.\n\nGBTC discount rate on BTC market price. Source: Coinglass .\n\nAnother factor promoting GBTC demand is the possibility of opening redemptions regardless of ETF approval amid scrutiny by a meaningful shareholder of Grayscale, Fir Tree Partners.\n\nFir Tree Partners had filed books-and-records litigation against Grayscale in 2022, accusing them of mismanagement and conflicts of interest.\n\nYesterday, the trust fund settled outside court, agreeing to produce certain books and records in response to Fir Tree\u2019s demand.\n\nFir Tree argues that Grayscale\u2019s management has not acted in favor of its shareholders by limiting redemptions. They wrote Grayscale \u201cfailed to address our continued concerns about GBTC\u2019s structure and the unavailability of redemptions.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of Grayscale, failed to repay a $630 million loan to Genesis, and U.S.-based Gemini filed a lawsuit against DCG and its CEO Barry Silbert accusing them of fraud related to their Genesis offerings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe events have increased the urgency among GBTC shareholders like Fir Tree to enable early redemptions, with the firm writing that it is now time for Grayscale and DCG \u201cto facilitate GBTC share redemptions.\u201d"

Shouts of \u201cYou\u2019re buying thin air\u201d, and \u201cWhy are you wasting your money on nonsense\u201d could sometimes be heard, but over the years, this cryptocurrency has more than proven its worth, with Bitcoin being so in demand that the price has skyrocketed and early buyers have even found themselves being able to retire thanks to the value of the crypto. It\u2019s become so popular that there are even ATMs dotted around to transact with Bitcoin, but what are they and how do they work?\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin ATM?\n\nMost banks will have ATMs set up to provide a quick and convenient way for their customers to access their accounts, withdraw money and check their balance. Bitcoin ATMs are different in the sense that instead of withdrawing, they provide the option to insert cash and have it exchanged into this form of cryptocurrency.\n\nThis can be done in a wide selection of locations, with options for multiple currencies to be exchanged, with USD being the most popular option.\n\nAs almost $11 billion Bitcoin is traded with in every 24 hour period, these ATMs have made it easier to take part in peer to peer trades, as well as marketplace exchanges.\n\nHow can these machines be used?\n\nWith a Bitcoin ATM, everything is digitized, meaning that once the cash has been inserted, the steps that follow are straightforward whilst ensuring safety and security. In most cases, the cash will need to be applied first and then the user will have the option to log in using their Wallet ID, or a QR code directly from their smartphone.\n\nDepending on the currency being transacted with, the current market\u2019s exchange rate will be displayed, for example as 1 USD to BTC and the trader can choose to accept, or receive their cash back. The process was intentionally designed to be streamlined so as to avoid any potential drops in Bitcoin value from hour to hour.\n\nWhy might a Bitcoin ATM be used?\n\nThere are a number of reasons why people may choose to use an ATM for Bitcoin \u2013 from topping up their wallet ready for a trade, right through to taking advantage of a sudden reduction in crypto value.\n\nThe option can be ideal for both long-term and short-term traders, too, as once deposited, the cash exchanged will immediately transfer into BTC, allowing the sum to be stored, or traded away as soon as required, and without any delay.\n\nWhat is needed to use a Bitcoin ATM?\n\nWith more than 63,000 Bitcoin ATMs throughout the United States alone, traders will find at least one accessible within convenience stores, malls and other locations.\n\nIn order to use the machine, the trader will first need cash, and access to their Bitcoin wallet ID.\n\nThe machine has a small slot for paper cash to be inserted, and this will need to be done one bill at a time. Each time a bill is approved, the machine will register the amount. Once the transaction is complete, a button on the touchscreen can be pressed and a new image will load providing details on the currency exchange rate as defined by the market at that time.\n\nThe ATM is maintained under strict supervision, allowing it to retrieve data securely from a global server, which in turn provides up-to-date currency values on the spot.\n\nThe Wallet ID can be added, or the QR code can be scanned by the built-in camera, or alternatively by tapping the sensor on compatible machines, and the user will then have the option to complete their transfer once the credentials have been accepted.\n\nAre these machines safe to use?\n\nYes, in fact, they use some of the most advanced encryption software available, surpassing the technology of certain banks.\n\nHuman error is one of the leading contributors of issues arising, however, and these machines are not impervious to fraudulent activities, and so caution is always advised.\n\nThere is also a small fee to consider when using these ATMs, often between 13 and 15% of the total transaction value. For instance, when transferring $100 USD into Bitcoin, the machine\u2019s software will retain anywhere between $13 and $15.\n\nOther fees can apply, such as flat fees, or currency conversion fees \u2013 but this will all be detailed on the device itself.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nBitcoin ATMs provide a safe, secure way to access a Bitcoin wallet, review an account\u2019s balance, or simply insert a cash currency and have it exchanged into BTC with minimal fuss. They are ideal for traders that don\u2019t currently have access to an app, or want to take advantage of a decline in BTC value. Additionally, they are frequently maintained for peace of mind and some models even have options to make payments to other Wallet account holders, making them ideal for quick transactions on the go, or when Bitcoin is the preferred method of payment and a wallet needs to be topped up.\n\nFeatured image credit: Unsplash"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin continued to trade flat at roughl$31,700 on Wednesday after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) published June\u2019s inflation data, reflecting a monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase of 0.2%, and a yearly increase of 3.0%.\n\nEthereum also only faced a minor gain of 1.3%, per CoinGecko, and is now trading at nearly $1,900.\n\nThe increase fell just short of economists' estimates as polled by Dow Jones, which expected a 0.3% month-over-month increase, and an annual rise of 3.1%.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, core CPI\u2013which discounts the food and energy sectors due to their known volatility\u2013rose by just 0.2% which is the \u201csmallest 1-month increase in that index since August 2021,\u201d per the BLS.\n\nSince March 2022, the Federal Reserve has rapidly risen its policy interest rate in a mission to bring searing inflation back to its 2% target in the United States, after peaking last June at 9.1%.\n\nSo far, the central bank\u2019s efforts seem to be paying off, with annualized inflation down 1% from last month alone.\n\nSadly for investors, rising interest rates have also contributed to cratering stock and crypto prices throughout the last year, with both major tech and blockchain companies being forced to enact massive layoffs.\n\nAs such, falling inflation is generally taken as bullish for markets, since it means the Fed is closer to ending its hawkish monetary policy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the central bank chose to keep its policy rate unchanged last month, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been hesitant to indicate whether this means rate hikes will pause or resume in the near future.\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, markets are 91% confident that another 0.25% rate hike is in the cards at the next Federal Open Markets Committee Meeting (FOMC) on July 26.\n\nMarkets are still waiting on June\u2019s Personal Consumption Index (PCI) figures, which track how consumers change their buying habits over time. This is the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation as it\u2019s considered a strong predictor of where inflation is headed in the future. It currently projects this figure at 3.2%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s non-reaction on Wednesday may be an indication of its current place in its cyclical market cycle.\n\nAs reported by Glassnode on Monday, Bitcoin\u2019s price has reached an \u201cequilibrium point\u201d which often signals an incoming \u201caccumulation phase\u201d during which the asset\u2019s price trades flat for many months to come."

        "title": "New risks to investing in Bitcoin ETFs: Why investing in them won\u2019t profit you much - Gulf News",
        "content": "Dubai: The high price of a single Bitcoin has often made the crypto investment beyond the reach of most investors worldwide. This is why there has been a lot of interest in finding alternative ways to invest in Bitcoin and reduce the risks that come with directly buying the top cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is one such alternative. With it, investors can get exposure to cryptocurrencies without having to go through the trouble of setting up a wallet or dealing with erratic exchanges. But they are not without risks, flag industry experts.\n\nWhat are crypto ETFs? Cryptocurrency exchange traded funds (ETFs) track a single cryptocurrency or a basket of different digital tokens and currencies.\n\n\u201cBy buying shares of a Bitcoin ETF, you can gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin, but investors looking to utilise ETFs to access cryptocurrencies are not necessarily getting what wanted,\u201d explained Brian Deshell, a UAE-based cryptocurrency trader and analyst.\n\n\u201cInvestors should be convinced that by investing in a regulated product like a Bitcoin ETF, their money will be safe. However, it\u2019s not proven to be effective as means to exponentially grow your money in the crypto market. Moreover, there has hardly been any progress in regulatory approvals.\u201d\n\nInvestors should be convinced that by investing in a regulated product like a Bitcoin ETF, their money will be safe.\n\n10 years since launch, but hardly any progress\n\nIt was in mid-2013 when the first approval was sought for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. Although it\u2019s been a decade since the first application for an ETF was made, the US is still waiting for the first Bitcoin ETF product. The reason being the securities regulator isn\u2019t convinced.\n\n\u201cWhile Bitcoin ETFs have existed for some time outside the US, in Canada, Europe, and elsewhere in the world, they have failed to attract large investor interest,\u201d added Deshell. But why has interest suddenly sparked again in the investment?\n\nIn the last few weeks, over half a dozen new applications for a Bitcoin ETFs were filed in the US to the securities regulator. BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, and US-based Fidelity Investments were the latest firms to apply.\n\nWhile any regulator worldwide has yet to approve such an ETF \u2013 despite receiving numerous applications \u2013 there is now more optimism the regulator will approve one because some of the previous concerns are assumed to have been addressed in recent filings, top investment bank JPMorgan noted recently.\n\nETF doesn\u2019t always mean a safer investment\n\n\u201cWhy investors are not convinced with Bitcoin ETFs as an investment is because they are not able to profit as much as those who buy Bitcoin directly. Bitcoin ETFs do not currently own Bitcoin itself as regulators are concerned that Bitcoin is traded on non-regulated crypto exchanges,\u201d added Deshell.\n\n\u201cInstead, Bitcoin ETFs own companies and other ETFs that are related to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general. There is also the added risk of ETFs trading on the market, which adds to their volatility. In that case, mutual funds fare better as they are not traded directly on a stock exchange.\u201d\n\nAlthough a Bitcoin ETF isn\u2019t a direct investment in cryptocurrency, it\u2019s still risky due to the exposure to Bitcoin, opined Brody Dunn, an investment manager at a UAE-based asset advisory firm, who went on to explain why.\n\n\u201cThose that may have been waiting to invest in Bitcoin ETFs and thought that this was the thing that\u2019s going to make it incredibly safe for them, without really doing the due diligence, that\u2019s where the concern is,\u201d cautioned Dunn.\n\nAlthough a Bitcoin ETF isn\u2019t a direct investment in cryptocurrency, it\u2019s still risky due to the exposure to Bitcoin.\n\nBig investors may profit more from crypto ETFs\n\nThough Dunn notes that the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF is good for the overall Bitcoin and crypto market, he warns that it may not benefit investors individually.\n\n\u201cAn ETF is going to drive more of that institutional money in, but they\u2019re going to make a ton of money,\u201d he added. \u201cIt does help the market, but what about the average investor? It\u2019s supposed to help them, but that\u2019s not necessarily what is happening here.\u201d\n\nCrypto experts like Deshell, along with some others in the crypto community, agree with Dunn. Some argue that the major firms involved in a potential ETF investment, including hedge funds and providers, would benefit more than individual investors.\n\n\u201cDirect exposure is the best way for a new investor to get into Bitcoin,\u201d Dunn added. \u201cBitcoin ETF is just a product to help hedge funds and other middlemen make more money, and newbie investors shouldn\u2019t be buying without understanding.\u201d\n\nBitcoin ETF is just a product to help hedge funds and other middlemen make more money, and newbie investors shouldn\u2019t be buying without understanding - Brody Dunn, an investment manager\n\nBottom line: Good to buy Bitcoin ETFs now?\n\n\u201cIf you don't want to actively manage your crypto investment, but you want a way to diversify your portfolio with a high-risk, high-reward asset, a Bitcoin ETF is a better option than directly buying Bitcoin,\u201d said Deshell.\n\nAmong the several benefits of Bitcoin ETFs, the key perks are low cost of ownership, being able to diversify your crypto investments, while having somebody with knowledge of the market to manage them, which also enables you to save time picking crypto tokens.\n\n\u201cAlso, owning crypto ETFs saves investors from costs like network charges and transaction fees. An ETF provider is responsible for the safety of the fund, offering a sense of security to investors. These are factors that should drive you to invest. But it isn\u2019t always that straight-forward,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBitcoin ETFs are now observed to amplify volatility in prices and create risks for investors if the fund is a large share of the market. Recent trends suggest that ETFs can exacerbate price movements and create additional volatility when they have a large footprint in the underlying asset.\u201d"

        "title": "A comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin halvings and their implications, along with predictions for the next expected event - Equiti Global",
        "content": "The previous halvings have caused significant market movements by increasing both the value of the cryptocurrency and the interest from investors\n\nThere has been three Bitcoin halvings so far and the next halving is expected to happen in April 2024\n\nBitcoin halvings refer to the reduction of the block reward that cryptominers receive for adding blocks to the blockchain\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin halving?\n\nWhen cryptominers add new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain, they are rewarded with a portion of the currency. This is called the block reward. Bitcoin halvings are an integral part of the Bitcoin protocol as they reduce the block reward by half every 210,000 blocks. However, due to the dynamic nature of the Bitcoin blockchain it\u2019s hard to accurately predict the precise timing of future halvings.\n\nThe time it takes to add a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain can vary, although the protocol aims for a block time of 10 minutes. To maintain this target, the mining difficulty automatically adjusts in response to the rate of block additions. If blocks are mined too quickly, the difficulty increases, and if they are mined too slowly, the difficulty decreases. These adjustments take place approximately every 2016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks.\n\nIn the world of Bitcoin, the halving events have become highly anticipated moments that often spark significant market movements. There has already been three halvings of bitcoin, and as the next one is on the horizon, it's worth examining the history of these events and exploring their potential impact on the future of the world's most popular cryptocurrency.\n\nThe first Bitcoin halving occurred in November 2012, followed by the second in July 2016, and the third in May 2020. While it is impossible to forecast the exact duration for adding blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain, most estimates suggest that the next Bitcoin halving will occur in early April 2024. As the halving approaches, the accuracy of these estimates tends to improve.\n\nThe future of Bitcoin halving is of great interest to investors, traders, and enthusiasts alike. While past performance does not guarantee future results, the historical patterns surrounding halvings have instilled optimism within the Bitcoin community. The reduced block rewards resulting from halvings contribute to the scarcity narrative of Bitcoin, fuelling expectations of increased demand and, consequently, a potential surge in its price.\n\nHistory of Bitcoin halvings\n\nThe path of Bitcoin's halvings has been characterized by significant milestones, price volatility, and a growing interest from various investors.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the significance of Bitcoin halvings, let's have a look at the previous halvings. It becomes evident that each halving event has been accompanied by a substantial surge in the price of Bitcoin. In other words, the price at each subsequent halving has exceeded the price observed during the previous event.\n\nThe pre-halving period\n\nBefore Bitcoin's historic first halving event in 2012, a period known as the pre-halving era shaped the early days of the cryptocurrency. This phase, which spanned from Bitcoin's launch on January 3, 2009, to November 28, 2012, witnessed significant developments and laid the groundwork for the digital asset's future.\n\nDuring this period, the Bitcoin protocol awarded cryptominers with a generous block reward of 50 BTC. Notably, the enigmatic figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, played an active role in mining Bitcoin and amassed a substantial amount of the digital currency. Estimates suggest that Nakamoto potentially mined between 750,000 and 1.1 million BTC, rendering them one of the wealthiest individuals on the planet if they are still alive.\n\nKey figures from the pre-halving period:\n\nBlock reward: 50 BTC\n\nBitcoins mined: 10.5 million\n\nHighest price: $29.6\n\nLowest price: $0.06\n\nThe first halving\n\nOn November 28, 2012, the Bitcoin network witnessed its inaugural halving event, effectively reducing the block reward to 25 BTC. This marked the beginning of the first halving cycle, coinciding with Bitcoin's rise to prominence in mainstream circles. Notably, Bitcoin gained attention for its utilization on dark web marketplaces such as Silk Road during this period. Additionally, the collapse of the Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange garnered significant media coverage.\n\nKey details of the first halving:\n\nHalving date: November 28, 2012\n\nBlock reward: 25 BTC\n\nBitcoins mined: 5.25 million\n\nHighest price: $1,170\n\nLowest price: $12.4\n\nThe second halving\n\nThe second Bitcoin halving occurred on July 9, 2016, ushering in a new era with a block reward of 12.5 BTC. This phase witnessed heightened competition for Bitcoin in the cryptocurrency market as Ethereum emerged as an attractive competitor. The popularity of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) also contributed to a crypto market bubble that reached its peak in late 2017 and early 2018.\n\nDespite the growing competition, Bitcoin investors still had the opportunity to reap substantial gains, with the price surging to nearly $20,000 during this cycle.\n\nKey details of the second halving:\n\nHalving date: July 9, 2016\n\nBlock reward: 12.5 BTC\n\nBitcoins mined: 2.625 million\n\nHighest price: $19,400\n\nLowest price: $8,590\n\nThe third halving\n\nOn May 11, 2020, the highly anticipated third Bitcoin halving took place, reducing the block reward to 6.25 BTC. This event pushed Bitcoin into uncharted territory, with its market capitalisation surpassing $1 trillion for the first time ever. Bitcoin's value skyrocketed to an all-time high of $67,450, attracting attention from both sophisticated investors and a broader mainstream audience.\n\nAs the current halving cycle unfolds, the Bitcoin community eagerly awaits the upcoming fourth halving.\n\nKey details of the third halving:\n\nHalving date: May 11, 2020\n\nBlock reward: 6.25 BTC\n\nBitcoins mined: 1.3125 million\n\nHighest price: $67,400\n\nLowest price: $535\n\nHow many Bitcoin halvings will there be?\n\nBitcoin, with a maximum supply of 21 million BTC, has seen 19.22 million BTC mined to date. As the mining process progresses, the remaining Bitcoin becomes scarcer, intensifying the competition among cryptominers. Once the full 21 million BTC are mined, Bitcoin miners will no longer receive block rewards, relying solely on transaction fees paid by users.\n\nThe future holds numerous Bitcoin halvings, as these events will continue until the very last Bitcoin is mined. In total, there will be 32 Bitcoin halvings, meaning that there are still 29 halvings yet to occur.\n\nAs we anticipate the upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024, it's worth noting that by that time, approximately 93.7% of the total Bitcoin supply will have been mined, leaving a diminishing number of new coins entering circulation.\n\nMarket impact of Bitcoin halvings\n\nBitcoin halvings have captivated the cryptocurrency industry, marking pivotal moments that shape the Bitcoin mining economy and instigate cyclical price movements within the market.\n\nThe scarcity of Bitcoin resulting from these halvings is a driving force behind its value proposition. With a limited supply and increasing demand, Bitcoin has garnered attention from institutional investors and mainstream audiences alike. This unique economic model contributes to the narrative of Bitcoin as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation.\n\nWhile the specific impact of future halvings on the Bitcoin market remains uncertain, historical patterns suggest that halvings often coincide with increased market activity and upward price trends. Market participants closely monitor these events, seeking potential opportunities for investment and speculation.\n\nAs the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, Bitcoin halvings remain a focal point for market participants. They represent a crucial mechanism designed to regulate the issuance of new Bitcoins, exerting influence on the supply and demand dynamics of the digital asset. Whether the trend of price appreciation at each halving will persist is uncertain, but the anticipation and speculation surrounding these events continue to capture the attention of the crypto community.\n\nIn summary, Bitcoin halvings hold tremendous significance for the crypto industry, regulating the mining economy and fostering market dynamics. With 29 more halvings on the horizon, Bitcoin's limited supply and the potential for increased scarcity continue to capture the attention of market participants. As we journey towards the last Bitcoin being mined, the crypto community eagerly awaits the future halvings and their impact on the ever-evolving Bitcoin ecosystem."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining \u2013 a catalyst for economic growth?\n\nBitcoin presents a unique opportunity for the United Kingdom. Its potential goes beyond being a decentralised form of payment; it can drive renewable energy development, create jobs, and generate tax revenue.\n\nBy understanding the value and potential of Bitcoin, the UK government can position itself as a leader in the evolving digital payment space.\n\nThe global market for the Bitcoin mining industry alone is valued at $1.92 billion (\u00a31.53 billion) and is predicted to rise to $7 billion (\u00a35.56 billion) by 2032. However, the UK currently holds a meagre share of 0.23% in Bitcoin mining, lagging behind smaller nations.\n\nIt is crucial for the UK government to recognise the economic growth potential within this sector and take action to attract investment and foster job creation. By doing so, the UK can tap into this emerging market and establish itself as a significant player in Bitcoin mining.\n\nThe environmental advantage\n\nContrary to popular misconceptions, Bitcoin mining can be an ally to the UK\u2019s renewable energy ambitions. The country faces the challenge of intermittent energy sources like wind and solar, which necessitates overbuilding the supply to ensure a consistent energy flow.\n\nBitcoin miners can play a crucial role by co-locating with renewable energy plants, monetising surplus power, and providing an ideal demand response. By maximising the utilisation of renewable energy sources, Bitcoin mining can contribute to a greener energy grid and help reduce emissions.\n\nRegulation for success\n\nTo unlock the potential of Bitcoin mining and attract large-scale miners, the UK requires clear and effective regulation. The country\u2019s contacts with large Bitcoin mining entities emphasise the need for regulatory clarity and highlight the interest in utilising the UK\u2019s wasted and stranded energy.\n\nBy treating Bitcoin mining on par with data or AI computer centres, the UK can create a conducive environment for miners to thrive. A prime example of innovative mining solutions is Scilling Mining, which uses agricultural waste to power miners, directly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBy embracing such practices, the UK can position itself as a global leader in sustainable cryptocurrency mining.\n\nMitigating wind energy challenges\n\nThe UK faces challenges in efficiently harnessing wind energy due to limitations in the power transmission network.\n\nThe curtailment of wind turbines on the windiest days costs the National Grid \u00a3215 million annually, ultimately burdening consumers through higher energy bills. However, strategically locating Bitcoin mining operations near wind farms can provide a solution.\n\nBy absorbing excess energy during peak production, Bitcoin mining can optimise wind energy utilisation and generate additional revenue. This symbiotic relationship between wind energy and Bitcoin mining can address grid infrastructure limitations while bolstering economic growth.\n\nThe road to a greener future\n\nEmbracing careful regulations that encompass Bitcoin mining and AI compute centres can lead the UK towards a greener future. Beyond fostering job creation and generating tax revenue, this approach can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nCutting methane (CH4) emissions, in particular, is crucial for slowing down climate change, and the UK\u2019s significant sources of CH4 include the oil & gas industry, landfills, and agriculture. By implementing sustainable Bitcoin mining practices, the UK can make significant strides in reducing emissions from these sectors.\n\nIt is important to recognise that Bitcoin\u2019s energy use should not be compared to that of a single country, as it is a global network.\n\nComparing it to the energy consumption of individual countries can be misleading. In reality, Bitcoin uses only 0.22% of global energy, highlighting its relatively low energy footprint compared to larger countries like China and the US.\n\nUnderstanding this perspective is crucial to accurately assess the energy impact of Bitcoin and its potential role in a sustainable energy future.\n\nThe security level of the Bitcoin network has experienced a significant increase of over 200% (211% more mining power added) since 2017.\n\nRemarkably, during this period, the emission intensity of the network, which measures greenhouse gas emissions per kilowatt-hour (KWH), has actually decreased by 4%.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy embracing Bitcoin mining, the UK can unlock opportunities for economic growth, renewable energy development, and emissions reduction.\n\nWith the right regulatory framework and strategic partnerships, the UK can position itself as a leader in sustainable cryptocurrency mining.\n\nIt is time to recognise the value and potential of Bitcoin, harness its benefits, and pave the way for a greener and more prosperous future for the United Kingdom."

Source: PlanB\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength indicator (RSI) has emerged from the zero line on the two-week chart, indicating the start of a bull market, as it imitated the trend from 2016, according to a tweet shared by pseudonymous crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade.\n\nOn top of that, trends indicate that Bitcoin is preparing for a possible all-time high (ATH), as it has historically demonstrated the start of a bull run in the 22 months before the United States presidential election and has recently entered the pre-run phase, the crypto trading expert explained.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time trading at the price of $30,594, indicating a loss of 0.24% in the last 24 hours and declining 1.77% across the previous seven days while still hanging onto the 16.98% gain from its monthly chart.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart.

        "title": "Bitcoin: Plot twist on Satoshi Nakamoto identity - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "There has been a lot of talk in recent hours about Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist who has repeatedly proclaimed himself as the creator of the Bitcoin protocol, under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nYesterday, an article was published by Forbes highlighting new evidence of a possible correlation between Wright and Nakamoto.\n\nHave we finally reached the discovery of the century?\n\nLet\u2019s look at all the details together.\n\nThe story of Satoshi Nakamoto: the inventor of Bitcoin\n\nOn 31 October 2008, an anonymous individual with the nickname \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d published a very important document on the cryptographic mailing list \u201cmetzdowd.com.\u201d\n\nIt is one of the most influential manifestos of cypherpunk culture, titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\u201d introducing to the world for the first time the primordial idea of a blockchain-based digital currency that does not rely on a central bank.\n\nThe philosophy of a decentralized protocol that would allow P2P virtual money exchanges was immediately endorsed by a number of engineers and computer nerds, who began work on what we now know as \u201cBitcoin.\u201d\n\nThese include the names of Hal Finney, Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen, and Jeff Garzik, who had the honor of conversing online with the still unknown Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nOn 23 April 2011, Satoshi disappeared from the scene definitively, stating as his last correspondences to software developer Mike Hearn that he would \u201cmove on to other things\u201d and that the project had been placed in \u201cgood hands\u201c\n\nFrom then on, as the Bitcoin project continued to expand and become more important, no one heard from Satoshi.\n\nTo this day we still do not know whether a single person or a group of individuals is behind this pseudonym.\n\nThe only thing that is certain is that the address with which Satoshi generated the first block of the Bitcoin infrastructure, known as the \u201cGenesis Block,\u201d contains (along with other addresses) an amount exceeding 1 million BTC.\n\nNot one single satoshi (sat) has been spent from that wallet, which in the jargon indicates the smallest expendable part of the coin, or one hundred millionth of BTC.\n\nFor this reason many believe that Nakamoto is dead, or that he was captured (according to some conspiracy theories) by the CIA or some special force belonging to a supposed government.\n\nOver the years a number of speculations have come forward about the real identity of the computer genius, first the name of \u201cDorian Nakamoto,\u201d a Japanese programmer, emerged, then that of Craig Wright, an Australian engineer who proclaimed himself \u201cthe creator of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nPrecisely in reference to the latter figure, Forbes released some details that would show an impeccable correlation between the two figures.\n\nIt may not matter if Craig Wright created Bitcoin. The real question is whether the nearly 4,000 patents he controls or has pending will force computer programmers around the world to stop using open-source software as they now do\u2014or pay up. https://t.co/V13JfEaHLl pic.twitter.com/J3xyubWSAW \u2014 Forbes (@Forbes) July 12, 2023\n\nNew speculation on Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s identity: the famous Bitcoin creator could be Craig Wright\n\nSince the publication of the Forbes article, speculation has increased about a possible attribution of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s identity to Craig Wright.\n\nThe individual has been claiming since 2016 to be the inventor of the cryptocurrency, having even won a lawsuit related to copyright ownership of Bitcoin\u2019s Whitepaper.\n\nSome prominent members of the Bitcoin community, such as programmer Gavin Andresen, had confirmed in the past that Wright was Nakamoto, though later he withdrew his assumptions.\n\nHe was reportedly working with Dave Klaiman, a deceased 2013 cybersecurity expert, on the creation of the decentralized protocol, according to the direct reports.\n\nAs of today, speculations of a real correlation between the Australian engineer and the famous Satoshi Nakamoto are becoming more and more concrete.\n\nMost notably, it has emerged that Wright allegedly published a blog post on 10 January 2009 announcing the launch of Bitcoin, which would actually be launched a few hours later.\n\nThe post was reportedly deleted a day after its publication and rediscovered a few days ago from an online archive.\n\nIn any case, despite this \u201cevidence,\u201d no one in the Bitcoin community believes in the convergence of Craig Wright\u2019s identity with Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nPrimarily because Nakamoto himself reportedly stated in a 2015 hidden note marked with one of his addresses that:\n\n\u201cCraig Steven Wright is a liar and a fraud. He doesn\u2019t have the keys used to sign this message. The Lightning Network is a significant achievement. However, we need to continue work on improving on-chain capacity. Unfortunately, the solution is not to just change a constant in the code or to allow powerful participants to force out others.\u201d\n\nHaving briefly reappeared on the scene with this message after the real creator of Bitcoins dropped out of the 2011 project developments, no one believed Wright\u2019s claims anymore.\n\nAs for the latest blog post that would prove knowledge of the protocol even before it was published, some users on Twitter came to the rescue, pointing out that it is easily possible to create a URL that falsely claims a certain date reference.\n\nThe actual publication of the post would be dated between 2014 and 2015.\n\nComplete \ud83d\udc02\n\n\n\nAnyone can create a URL stating a certain date. This was indexed between 2014 and 2018. So NO this is not proof pic.twitter.com/f2Utm8CrKX \u2014 John (@DeFiFrontiers) July 12, 2023\n\nWill Craig Wright ever be able to destroy the Bitcoin protocol?\n\nBeyond the real correspondence between the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, originator of the Bitcoin philosophy, and Craig Wright, the latest Forbes article warned the crypto enthusiast community about a significant danger.\n\nThe Australian computer scientist, in fact, is in possession of as many as 800 patents related to the development of blockchain technologies and waiting to receive 3,000 more in 46 different jurisdictions.\n\nAccording to Forbes, the huge amount of patents could one day force all programmers around the world to stop approving transactions on the Bitcoin network, should Wright decide to make the coin\u2019s code \u201cclosed-source.\u201d\n\nThus, one of the most important open-source software in the history of the Internet is in danger of being attacked by a petty individual who, while having failed in his attempt to reclaim the figure of Satoshi Nakamoto, could ruin the work of the past 14 years.\n\nIt may not matter if Craig Wright created Bitcoin. The real question is whether the nearly 4,000 patents he controls or has pending will force computer programmers around the world to stop using open-source software as they now do\u2014or pay up. https://t.co/V13JfEaHLl pic.twitter.com/J3xyubWSAW \u2014 Forbes (@Forbes) July 12, 2023\n\nEven though at the moment the danger still seems to be far away, there will be a struggle in the coming years to prevent the technological developments of the entire industry from being compressed by Craig Wright, who, to put it bluntly, would never have tried to centralize the system if he really were Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nHowever things turn out, Bitcoin and its ecosystem have become so strong and compact that they can be considered resilient to any kind of censorship or privatization, whether by an institution or a private individual.\n\nBlockchain technology and cryptography allow anyone to collaborate anonymously with the Bitcoin network, enabling its perpetual survival.\n\nCraig Wright may be able to claim his position and name on a variety of blockchain-related activities, but he will never be able to stop a libertarian movement that is now established worldwide.\n\nCraig you will never own us.\n\nWe are all Satoshi."
