        "title": "Has Bitcoin Benefited From the Banking Crisis? Not in the Way Its Fans Hoped. - The New York Times",
        "content": "Shortly after Silicon Valley Bank failed this month, the price of Bitcoin soared above $25,000, reaching a threshold the digital currency hadn\u2019t touched since June. This week, Bitcoin reached nearly $30,000, up 70 percent for the year.\n\nBitcoin proponents seized on the price rise to argue that the banking crisis was prompting investors to convert traditional currencies into digital coins. One crypto executive hailed the bank failures as \u201cthe end of the USD and the dawn of hyperbitcoinization.\u201d A company that markets Bitcoin to investors started putting references to the bank runs in its promotional materials.\n\nBut despite the fanfare, there is little evidence that the recent banking collapse has generated widespread support for Bitcoin as a financial alternative.\n\nInstead, the surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price was driven by a range of financial trends that have little to do with the technology\u2019s philosophical underpinnings, analysts said. The reasons for the surge include growing optimism that the Federal Reserve may pause interest rate increases, as well as increasing concerns about the safety of so-called stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency intended to maintain a price of $1."

        "title": "Top Fiat Currencies Used to Trade Bitcoin - Investopedia",
        "content": "Bitcoins can be earned either by mining them or receiving them as payment for providing goods or services\u2014or by exchanging them against fiat currencies (such as the U.S. dollar or the Japanese yen), or against other cryptocurrencies.\n\nKey Takeaways You can purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies on a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nSome people purchase cryptocurrencies to use as everyday currencies, while others treat crypto coins as an investment similar to buying stock.\n\nThe most-traded national currencies for Bitcoin are the U.S. dollar, the South Korean won, the Japanese yen, and the European Union's euro.\n\nDue to government regulations, the Chinese yuan holds 0% of the market share of currencies traded for Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nWho Buys Bitcoin?\n\nRapidly changing Bitcoin valuations have fueled a high volume of speculative trading activity around the globe. Many people who trust blockchain technology and the monetary ecosystem based on Bitcoin are purchasing virtual currency as long-term investments.\n\nIf Bitcoin is increasingly accepted by all genres of businesses\u2014from local coffee shops to large corporations\u2014that could help fuel the adoption of it as a virtual currency. Before making a purchase, some people may compare whether they are better off paying for an item in fiat currencies or in Bitcoins.\n\nFor others, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are investment assets, similar to a stock or futures contract. They purchase these currencies with their local fiat currency just as they would buy shares through a brokerage.\n\nTop Fiat Currencies for Bitcoin Trades\n\nCoinhills provides a list of the most traded national currencies for trading Bitcoin-based on information from currencies, markets, and exchanges registered at Coinhills. The data below is as of March 29, 2023.\n\n1. U.S. Dollar (USD)\n\nThe American dollar currently ranks first on the list of fiat currencies trading Bitcoins, with around 85.4% of the market share. The consistent top rank of the U.S. dollar in Bitcoin dealing is because of several factors.\n\nA quick adopter of any new technology, the U.S. found a large user base in the blockchain-based Bitcoin, which quickly gained traction in the country. Meanwhile, many other nations and their regulators were slow to embrace the development of Bitcoin. For example, in populous countries like India, individuals who are holding bitcoins directly or through intermediaries have bought them by first converting the Indian rupees to U.S. dollars and then using the dollars to purchase the bitcoins.\n\n2. Korean Won (KRW)\n\nThe South Korean won ranks second, with 5.1% of the market share. This is up from the fourth most-traded in 2021.\n\nThe share of KRW in Bitcoin trading declined for a while after 2018 because the country's regulators banned cryptocurrency traders in Korea from using anonymous bank accounts. The country's finance minister at the time, Kim Dong-Yeon, mentioned that \u201cthere is no intention to ban or suppress cryptocurrency (market).\" In 2020, Korea became one of the first countries to pass comprehensive cryptocurrency laws.\n\nWhen Bitcoin prices surged in 2021, however, about 10% of the population invested in cryptocurrencies. However, though they are a popular investment, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not treated as legal tender in South Korea.\n\n\n\nWith a nearly 4% market share, the Japanese yen comes in third when used for dealing in Bitcoin. Japan was previously the leader for many years thanks to multiple bans imposed by the Chinese government on China-based Bitcoin exchanges since September 2017. All those Bitcoin trading activities from China swiftly moved abroad, benefiting Japan the most.\n\nJapanese regulators were also some of the earliest adopters and among the most accommodating of the virtual currency. They have been very proactive in putting up the necessary regulations and have promptly streamlined Bitcoin trading, enabling it to gain a large share of the global market.\n\nThe currency of Europe, the Euro, ranks fourth on the list with a 2.9% market share in trading Bitcoin. Part of what hinders the Euro's growth when it comes to buying Bitcoin is that it remains confined to certain regions. The German city of Berlin has been welcoming to Bitcoin, with the Netherlands and Belgium also serving as important hubs for cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nNo Chinese Yuan\n\nInterestingly, the Chinese yuan no longer figures into the list of top fiat currencies used to trade Bitcoins. In 2014 and 2015, as the Chinese yuan was devalued, it surged to the top rank, beating both the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar. It maintained its lead until late 2017. However, amid increasing state-imposed regulations and crackdown on illegal Bitcoin trade, the dealings have rapidly moved to other venues, including Japan and Hong Kong, leaving the yuan out of the top list. As of March 2023, it ranked 44th, with a 0% market share.\n\nIs Bitcoin Stable? Bitcoin, and the entire cryptocurrency market, are known for being highly volatile and unstable. Recent problems and scandals in the industry have increased this instability. The collapse of the FTX exchange at the end of 2022 shook the entire market, causing it to lose billions in value overnight and leaving many investors unlikely to recover their money.\n\nHow Do I Buy Bitcoin? You can buy Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency on a crypto exchange. You can fund your account on the exchange using your bank account, credit card, or debit card, then exchange your dollars or other currency for coins. These coins are then stored in a cryptocurrency wallet, where they can be held, used as currency, or traded in the future.\n\nWhat Is the Highest Price Bitcoin Has Had? Bitcoin reached an all-time high price of $68,789 in November 2021. A year later, in November 2022, its price had dropped as low as $15,460.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile new Bitcoins are created through mining, existing ones can be purchased by using fiat currencies on a cryptocurrency exchange. The most-traded national currencies for Bitcoin are the U.S. dollar, the South Korean won, the Japanese yen, and the European Union's euro. Due to government regulations, the Chinese yuan holds 0% of the market share of currencies traded for Bitcoin.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other initial coin offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

The method of sale wasn\u2019t disclosed.\n\nIt is not the first time the US has sold off seized crypto.

        "content": "The crypto markets may be looking uncertain right now but some are still making money from Bitcoin sales: the U.S. government.\n\nAccording to court documents filed today, the Feds sold the crypto earlier this month\u2014making over $215 million.\n\nThe crypto in question came from the Silk Road marketplace. Hacker James Zhong confessed to stealing it, and then cops then took it in a historic seizure back in November. They are now selling it\u2014and they still have 41,490 Bitcoins ($1.1 billion) to get rid of, the filing said.\n\n\u201cWith respect to the 51,351.89785803 Bitcoin forfeited in the Ulbricht case before Judge Schofield, the Government has begun liquidating (selling) it,\u201d Friday\u2019s document read.\n\n\u201cOn March 14, 2023, the Government sold 9,861.1707894 BTC (of the 51,351.89785803 BTC) for a total of $215,738,154.98.

        "title": "Is Bitcoin Going to $100,000 -- or $0? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC 0.34%), the only cryptocurrency to ever hit a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion, has firmly established itself as the world's most widely used and accepted digital asset. Despite Bitcoin's astounding accomplishment and proven history of price appreciation, critics believe that one day soon it might be headed to worthlessness.\n\nTheir primary reasons usually point to its supposed lack of intrinsic value, absence of utility, and that it resembles a decentralized Ponzi scheme. This combination has led some to surmise that the chance of Bitcoin heading to $0 is much more likely than it ever reaching $100,000.\n\nIn reality, when evaluating historical and current trends around adoption of Bitcoin and what it offers users, it becomes clear that the likelihood that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 is much greater than it ever falling to zero.\n\nThe case for $100,000\n\nOne reason Bitcoin is more likely to hit $100,000 than zero is its increasing adoption, mainstream acceptance, and growth of its network. Over the past few years, more and more individuals and institutions have started to invest in Bitcoin, recognizing its potential as a store of value and means of exchange.\n\nMajor companies such as Tesla and Block have made significant investments in Bitcoin, and more traditional financial institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity have started to offer Bitcoin-related services to their clients. This growing acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin could drive up demand and increase its value over time.\n\nIn addition, when looking at the trajectory of crucial metrics related to Bitcoin's network, it becomes clear that the cryptocurrency is flourishing, even though its price remains more than 60% off from its all-time high. Statistics such as the number of addresses with a positive balance, average transaction size, and mining difficulty (a measure of the network's security and decentralizations), all sit at or near all-time highs.\n\nThe primary factor driving this growth and continued adoption of Bitcoin is related to its scarcity. Despite assertions by critics who say that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value, Bitcoin derives its value from the fact that it is unlike traditional fiat currencies that can be printed by central banks at will, inevitably eroding the purchasing power of those who hold them.\n\nThose who hold Bitcoin increase their purchasing power with time, as opposed to government-issued currencies. This is because Bitcoin is limited to a total supply of 21 million coins, and the rate at which new coins are created is cut in half every four years.\n\nShould more people come to this realization, Bitcoin could become a true beneficiary, thanks to the simple dynamics of supply and demand. As more individuals and institutions seek to invest in Bitcoin, there will be less available, and this could potentially drive up its value. If governments around the world continue to print more fiat currencies in response to economic crises like they have in the 21st century, then it isn't hard to imagine demand for a stable asset like Bitcoin could outpace its limited supply.\n\nFinally, technological advancements and improvements to the Bitcoin network could also contribute to a further rise in value. For example, the implementation of the Lightning Network, a Layer 2 payment protocol that allows for faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions, could make the cryptocurrency more accessible and user-friendly, potentially driving up demand as it proves to be more useful for everyday purchases.\n\nPatience is a virtue\n\nAlthough the future price of Bitcoin is impossible to predict with any accuracy, the combination of these factors makes it much more likely that Bitcoin will continue to rise in value over time, rather than hit zero. When considering this possible future, it makes investing at today's prices that much more alluring. Bitcoin is trading at about $28,000 at the time of writing, so if it hit $100,000, it would represent a 260% increase.\n\nThere's no telling when this could happen, and anyone who claims to know is just guessing. But as Bitcoin proves its resiliency and attractiveness as a store of value, its potential upside over the long term looks very attractive."

It\u2019s responsible for organizing, training and equipping military persons across the stars in a bid to protect US and allied interests.\n\nLowery is an active-duty US Space Force astronautical engineer and US National Defense Fellow at MIT whose job it is to advise senior military personnel on the implications of bitcoin, according to a bio of his latest book. Politico says it confirmed his rank with an Air Force spokesperson.\n\nLowery\u2019s thesis was released as a book in February under the title \u201cSoftwar: A Novel Theory on Power Projection and the National Strategic Significance of Bitcoin.\u201d It\u2019s said to describe a scenario in which governments duke it out with hashrate; fighting something akin to a Cold War, where the spoils are bitcoin and bragging rights.\n\nThe blurb reads:\n\n\u201cUsing scientific concepts from biology, evolution, anthropology, political science, and computer theory, Lowery summarizes the dynamics of power projection in human society and provides an argument for why emerging proof-of-work technologies (namely Bitcoin) will have a dramatic impact on how humans organize, cooperate, and compete on a global scale by empowering populations to project physical power in, from, and through cyberspace.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s consensus could also be harnessed to deter denial-of-service attacks, Lowery reportedly reasons, which would make it costly and therefore prohibitive for bad actors to spam software systems based on its principles.\n\nShould the asset be viewed through that lens, it would serve the US\u2019s interest to protect the network and foster an industry for domestic crypto mining, or so the thinking goes.\n\nBitcoin is a \u2018national strategic imperative\u2019\n\nIn a stark warning to US policymakers, the major contends the country should support and adopt bitcoin immediately in a bid to avoid losing its status as a global superpower.\n\nThat\u2019s just the kind of message of which industry proponents have hoped for years. Although, it\u2019s probably unlikely.\n\n\u201cMajor Lowery concludes that Bitcoin represents a national strategic imperative that the US should support and adopt as quickly as possible, else it risks losing its lead as a global superpower in the 21st century,\u201d states the book\u2019s description.\n\nInstead, the current campaign employed by US regulators and the White House has been to offer up no support in that regard, opting to regulate digital assets through litigation with little discourse, critics argue. Various arms of the US government have also routinely sold bitcoin seized as a result of criminal cases.\n\n\u201cOur first amendment rights to free speech will not protect you from government regulators who are actively maneuvering to ban bitcoin under the argument that it represents a threat to national security,\u201d Lowery tweeted Tuesday.\n\n\u201cYour best bet is to argue that it would be a national strategic security hazard to ban bitcoin. It would be against the second amendment (not just the first). It\u2019s an undefeatable argument, you just have to have the courage to use it,\u201d he said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "The Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Crypto Loans - Blockworks",
        "content": "The rapid adoption of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as an asset class unlocks several opportunities for investors. One such opportunity involves using these digital assets as collateral for loans directly tied to their underlying value.\n\nBitcoin and crypto loans give investors access to cash to meet their immediate needs, all while retaining any potential upside on the cryptocurrencies they hold. However, these loans are not risk-free, as evidenced by the billions of dollars lost by crypto investors in 2022 while lending assets to crypto loan platforms.\n\nThis article demystifies the concept of bitcoin and crypto loans. Readers will learn the benefits and risks of crypto loans, the options available, and answers to frequently asked questions about crypto loans. We first address some common reasons investors may consider getting a crypto loan.\n\nWhy get a crypto loan\n\nA cryptocurrency-backed loan is desirable for several reasons. The most obvious is that it gives investors access to cash without liquidating their cryptocurrency portfolio. Individuals may borrow against their crypto to finance major expenses such as paying off mortgages or buying a car.\n\nOthers may get a cryptocurrency loan to leverage their position and acquire more crypto assets. In a typical example, an investor may use 20% of their crypto portfolio to borrow US dollars and spend the borrowed amount on buying more cryptocurrency.\n\nThe ideal scenario is that the move pays off, upon which the investor can spend realized gains on repaying the initial loan and retaining the rest as profits. However, they may also incur losses if the value of the collateral asset(s) drops substantially during the loan duration.\n\nA crypto loan allows investors to tap into a credit line without spending capital. It becomes unsurprising then that several centralized and decentralized products with crypto loan offerings have attracted a significant user base for these loans.\n\nTypes of crypto loans\n\nCryptocurrency loan products may come in different structures and use diverse models to generate profit for the issuing entity. They may be classified into two broad categories: centralized and decentralized crypto loans.\n\nCentralized finance (CeFi) loans: CeFi loans, as the name suggests, are offered by centralized entities. A significant characteristic is that investors relinquish their collateral ownership by depositing supported assets on the platform. In exchange, they receive a credit line and can borrow money against their capital. A major downside of using a CeFi loan platform is that customers have little visibility into how the lender uses the deposited assets. Users must trust that the platform implements the best security and risk management standards to ensure they can withdraw their capital when they want.\n\nCeFi loans, as the name suggests, are offered by centralized entities. A significant characteristic is that investors relinquish their collateral ownership by depositing supported assets on the platform. In exchange, they receive a credit line and can borrow money against their capital.\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) loans: DeFi loans fundamentally differ from CeFi loans because no third party manages deposited collateral. Instead, the funds are stored in autonomous smart contracts designed to manage operations such as pooling user assets, yield generation and liquidation. DeFi loans are desirable due to their transparency and because the underlying protocols are computer codes that cannot be easily manipulated when built correctly. Loans are also largely overcollateralized, ensuring that there is minimal risk of default. The protocol automatically liquidates users\u2019 positions when they fall below the defined threshold. However, DeFi loan platforms present unique risks. Users must understand and assess these risks before using a bitcoin or crypto loan platform.\n\nDeFi loans fundamentally differ from CeFi loans because no third party manages deposited collateral. Instead, the funds are stored in autonomous smart contracts designed to manage operations such as pooling user assets, yield generation and liquidation.\n\nCrypto loan risks\n\nThe risks associated with crypto loans are diverse. For instance, prospective users may consider the fundamental value of the collateral asset, how the company generates the interest that it pays customers, collateral requirements,and technology risks.\n\nToken risk: The primary risk of taking out a crypto loan is the volatility of most digital assets. The risk becomes more profound if the underlying token has no fundamental value and continues in a downtrend for a relatively long time. An investor using such tokens may face liquidation if negative developments, such as a security exploit or network downtime, lead to a rapid decline in the value of the collateral asset. Bitcoin (BTC) is considered the most secure token, with ether (ETH) being the next best collateral asset. The risk curve becomes significantly greater, with other crypto assets having greater downside potential in the event of a market sell-off.\n\nCounterparty risk: Many crypto loan platforms, especially centralized services, take on significant counterparty risk to generate yield for customers. These companies typically loan customers\u2019 assets to hedge funds, quants and high-volume traders, institutional investors, and in some cases, other everyday investors searching for a crypto-backed credit line. However, the records show that this counterparty exposure risks user funds. The recent collapse of lending platforms such as BlockFi, Celsius, and Genesis reveals that these platforms may rehypothecate user funds. Rehypothecation is where the entity facilitating the loans uses posted collateral for their needs. Additionally, the entire lending system is mostly connected together as the firm may loan assets to its investors or other entities without the requisite collateral. Finding a platform with the least counterparty risk must be a top priority for anyone who wants to take out a loan against crypto. Ideally, platforms that do not offer interest-generating products pose minimal risk. Bitcoin-only lenders that adopt multi-signature or cold storage solutions are also relatively safer as they imbibe the ethos of security and self-custody. Borrowers enjoy more peace of mind knowing funds cannot be rehypothecated by the lender and are not stored by the lender on a third-party exchange where it is still susceptible to such rehypothecation, despite the lender\u2019s claims. Lenders offering low interest rates are more than likely rehypothecating customer funds, so be careful not to choose a loan provider as it\u2019s cheaper.\n\nMany crypto loan platforms, especially centralized services, take on significant counterparty risk to generate yield for customers. These companies typically loan customers\u2019 assets to hedge funds, quants and high-volume traders, institutional investors, and in some cases, other everyday investors searching for a crypto-backed credit line.\n\nTechnical Risk: Crypto lending introduces technical risks, which are mostly not present in traditional banking. The most basic form of risk is the irreversibility of blockchain transactions. In a classic example, the developers of Solana-based DeFi protocol OptiFi mistakenly locked $661k worth of assets while trying to destroy a smart contract. Other technology risk includes private key theft, smart contract exploits and price oracle manipulation. These outcomes are more closely associated with DeFi loan platforms. Nonetheless, centralized lenders are not immune as they actively participate in DeFi to generate revenue.\n\nCrypto lending introduces technical risks, which are mostly not present in traditional banking. The most basic form of risk is the irreversibility of blockchain transactions. In a classic example, the developers of Solana-based DeFi protocol OptiFi mistakenly locked $661k worth of assets while trying to destroy a smart contract.\n\nMargin Call: Investors risk losing their collateral if they fail to manage their position actively, and it falls below an acceptable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Consider an example where an investor deposits $1,000 worth of BTC to borrow $500 at an 80% LTV. This means the user would receive a margin call if their collateral balance drops to around 80% of the borrowed amount. In our example, the user\u2019s collateral will be sold to cover the loan if the collateral\u2019s value drops to $600. Most platforms have clearly stated LTV ratios and would issue a margin call for the user to deposit more assets if their position is at risk of liquidation. The volatile nature of the crypto market means users must respond swiftly to margin calls or lose their collateral. Investors may prioritize using crypto loan platforms that send automated price alerts if the LTV ratio is in danger of being breached. Being financially prepared and able to deposit collateral at any time day or night is also essential.\n\nInvestors risk losing their collateral if they fail to manage their position actively, and it falls below an acceptable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.

In our example, the user\u2019s collateral will be sold to cover the loan if the collateral\u2019s value drops to $600.\n\nRepayment failure risk: Fixed crypto loans include a predetermined repayment schedule for borrowers. Failure to keep up with payments may result in additional charges or collateral liquidation. Flexible loans allow users to repay their loans at any time. Still, users may struggle to repay loans if they incur substantial losses on their investments or face financial challenges in real life. Such outcomes may lead to permanent losses that could be avoided by not having exposure to crypto loans.\n\nFixed crypto loans include a predetermined repayment schedule for borrowers. Failure to keep up with payments may result in additional charges or collateral liquidation.\n\nPros vs. cons\n\nTaking out a loan against crypto collateral presents numerous benefits to investors. At the same time, it may present unique disadvantages that investors must understand before going down that path.\n\nPros\n\nInstant Liquidity: Investors can meet their immediate cash or liquidity demands without losing any potential upside on their crypto investment. This option comes in handy, especially during emergencies or funding large purchases.\n\nLeveraged investment: They can also boost their exposure to a certain asset(s) and thus maximize profits on their portfolio. For example, an investor may spend the borrowed amount to buy more cryptocurrency expecting the market to gain substantially. A positive outcome means more profits, as they can sell a portion of their portfolio to repay the loan.\n\nTax benefits: Investors avoid tax headaches when they choose to borrow against crypto rather than sell it to book profits or losses. In most jurisdictions, such borrows are not considered taxable events, thus allowing investors the option to hold on to their crypto assets for as long as they want.\n\nCons\n\nAbsence of self-custody: Most centralized loan platforms require users to relinquish their assets\u2019 custody. This approach means greater counterparty risks and even the possibility of losing funds permanently if the platform mismanages user funds or files for bankruptcy.\n\nAmplified losses: The volatile nature of the crypto market means users face substantial losses if the decision to purchase more assets using crypto collateral backfires. They could lose most of their collateral and completely miss out on any return on investment.\n\nRegulatory constraints: This disadvantage primarily applies to crypto loans through DeFi protocols. Since such platforms are typically run by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), investors cannot initiate legal proceedings if they lose deposited assets. Similar limitations also face crypto loans initiated with offshore companies operated by obscure entities.\n\nBitcoin-backed loans\n\nBitcoin-backed loans allow users to tap into bitcoin\u2019s collateral value to borrow fiat or stablecoins. This is one of the safest ways for users to obtain a crypto loan since BTC can be less volatile than other crypto assets and offers access to the highest LTV threshold (second only to stablecoins). Many CeFi and DeFi platforms support bitcoin-backed loans. They also tend to implement custody and security practices that align with the ethos of Bitcoin holders. The most Bitcoin-native options are loan products built on layer-2 bitcoin networks such as Liquid or Stacks. Such applications inherently rely on the Bitcoin network for security and offer a degree of self-custodial access to Bitcoiners.\n\nBitcoin-backed loans Examples\n\nVerify 21 \u2013 Verify 21 is a Bitcoin-only centralized lending platform where Bitcoiners can borrow against their BTC without worrying about the risk of rehypothecation. Verify 21 has no tokenomics feature, which often leads to increased volatility in the value of customer assets and creates new risk vectors for the platform. Verify 21 uses the popular institutional-grade cold storage solution BitGo. Users give up self-custody to access Verify 21\u2019s credit line but can rely on an on-chain proof of reserves scheme to confirm that assets are held 1:1 by the custodian.\n\n\u2013 Verify 21 is a Bitcoin-only centralized lending platform where Bitcoiners can borrow against their BTC without worrying about the risk of rehypothecation.

The platform allows users to access bitcoin-backed loans by converting their BTC to RBTC (a pegged version of bitcoin on RSK). Users deposit RBTC to borrow the protocol\u2019s stablecoin ZUSD which they can convert to fiat to meet their liquidity needs. Since non-custodial protocols handle the loan origination and repayment process, there are no KYC requirements, and borrowers enjoy self-custodial access with Sovryn.\n\n\u2013 Sovryn is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on the Rootstock (RSK) bitcoin sidechain.

Users can borrow against BTC on the platform by selecting from a list of open offers set up by lenders or setting up new borrow requests with their desired parameters. Hodl Hodl enables full self-custodial access by locking deposited collateral in a multisig contract. The borrower can access their BTC deposit by fulfilling the loan terms, while the multi-sig contract will easily transfer the collateral to the lender if the borrower fails to reach the payment terms. Hodl Hodl users can take out loans using the most popular stablecoins, although borrowers must make repayments in the collateral asset.\n\n\u2013 Hodl Hodl is a peer-to-peer lending protocol built on the layer-2 bitcoin solution Liquid Network.

Readers considering taking a bitcoin loan often find the information contained helpful.\n\nCrypto-backed loans\n\nCryptocurrency-backed loans are hugely popular and involve investors borrowing cash/stablecoins using cryptocurrencies (other than BTC) as collateral. The popularity of crypto-backed loans does not detract from their high-risk nature. Aside from the inherent increased volatility of altcoins, users incur technical and counterparty risks by taking crypto-backed loans.\n\nExamples:\n\nAave \u2013 Aave is the largest decentralized lending protocol in terms of locked value and represents a popular choice within the DeFi ecosystem. Aave is deployed across 11 different networks and offers the same service of letting users borrow against their crypto or earn a yield on deposited assets. The platform supports a wide range of assets and includes its AAVE native token, giving access to rewards earned by the Aave protocol.\n\nNexo \u2013 Nexo is a centralized lending platform that has been live since 2018. As one of the few survivors of the recent crypto winter, Nexo has cemented its position as one of the leading players by strictly authorizing only overcollateralized loan facilities for retail and institutional clients. Nexo lists several assets and features a native NEXO token which gives users access to lower interest rates on borrowings and a higher yield on deposited assets. Borrowers can repay their loans anytime if they maintain a healthy LTV on their collateral assets.\n\n\u2013 Nexo is a centralized lending platform that has been live since 2018.

Compound is Ethereum-native, supports a wide range of assets, and features the native COMP token for governance and distribution of protocol rewards. Like most DeFi protocols, Compound has had its fair share of security snafus, including a $102 million mistake in 2021. Technology-based risk is one of the many reasons investors must do due diligence before obtaining a crypto loan.\n\n\u2013 Compound Finance is the second-largest DeFi lending protocol for accessing crypto-backed loans.

This safeguard ensures the platform can easily liquidate user assets in the case of a default. Although newer protocols offer under-collateralized loans, such products are relatively nascent and pose greater risks.\n\nHow much can I borrow in crypto?\n\nThe amount you can borrow in crypto typically depends on the type of collateral asset and the LTV thresholds defined by the loan platform. In most cases, users can borrow up to 90% of stablecoins and up to 50% on BTC and ETH deposits. Users are usually recommended to take only a loan offer representing a smaller portion of their borrowable amount to avoid early liquidation.\n\nAre crypto loans legal?\n\nThere are no publicly-known laws that prohibit investors from accessing crypto-backed loans. Instead, most top-tier crypto lenders actively acquire various regulatory licenses to legalize their operations. Meanwhile, DeFi protocols still operate independently as regulators grapple with the right approach to manage the emerging technology.\n\nHow are crypto loans taxed?\n\nTax laws on crypto loans may differ based on jurisdictions. It is best to consult with a licensed tax advisor for guidance. That said, the law in most regions, including the United States, is that borrowing against crypto is not taxable. Investors only pay taxes when selling cryptocurrencies.\n\nAre crypto loans safe?\n\nCrypto loans are as safe as the lending platform can secure user assets, and the user can maintain a healthy LTV threshold. Users must do their research to find the most reputable platforms and ensure a healthy LTV ratio throughout their loan duration. In most cases, borrowing only up to 20% of deposited collateral and using relatively hard collateral such as bitcoin (BTC) provides a cushion even against severe market declines.\n\nGetting the most out of bitcoin and crypto loans\n\nThe opportunity to take out loans against bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency makes digital assets more appealing. In most cases, users can obtain a loan within minutes \u2013 a level of collateral liquidity not accessible with other asset classes.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin-only loans offer greater security because of the asset\u2019s highly-liquid profile and decentralized network structure. Investors must carefully weigh the risks of crypto-native loans and prioritize the most secure options for their long-term investment portfolio.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) briefly tipped over $29,000 on March 30, recording a new high for the year, despite recent United States regulatory crackdowns on crypto firms and related uncertainty.\n\nAccording to Cointelegraph Markets Pro, the price of Bitcoin reached $29,132.82 on March 30, reaching levels seen just before the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX in early November 2022.\n\nBitcoin's price over 24 hours.

According to the filing, officials sold roughly 9,861 BTC for more than $215 million on March 14, leaving roughly 41,491 BTC.\n\n\u201cThe Government understands [the seized Bitcoin] is expected to be liquidated in four more batches over the course of this calendar year,\u201d said the court filing. \u201cThe Government understands from IRS Criminal Investigation - Asset Recovery & Investigative Services that the second round of liquidation will not be sold prior to Zhong\u2019s sentencing date.\u201d\n\nIn November, Zhong pled guilty to wire fraud charges related to executing a scheme to steal Bitcoin from Silk Road in 2012. U.S. authorities seized more than 50,000 BTC \u2014 worth more than $3 billion at the time \u2014 from his Georgia home in November 2021.

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 1.3% in the week from March 24 to March 31 to trade at US$28,286 at 9:30 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether rose 2.67% in the same period to US$1,819.\n\nThe crypto market saw another tumultuous week after the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance was sued by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for allegedly offering futures and derivatives products to U.S. residents without registering with the CFTC as required by law. Binance has denied the allegations.\n\nBinance returned to the headlines just three days later when the Financial Times, citing internal Binance documents, alleged the exchange had concealed its operations in China, despite saying it left the country in 2017. A Binance spokesperson said the report comprises anonymous sources recycling old news and \u201cdramatically mischaracterizing events.\u201d\n\nDespite Binance\u2019s troubles and the threats to other exchanges, Bitcoin traded above US$27,000 for most of the week, dipping to US$26,677 on Tuesday before recovering. The world\u2019s first cryptocurrency rose 1.3% during the week and 26.1% during the month of March.\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, said that investors are sophisticated enough to delineate between Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market.\n\n\u201cCrypto company after crypto company has collapsed or faced headwinds in the past nine months, and yet Bitcoin has recovered in the wake of each wave of negative headlines. Investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a standalone commodity, not tied to any central organization,\u201d wrote Stadelmann.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s correlation with the Nasdaq 100 has decreased to the lowest since the U.S. Federal Reserve first telegraphed rate hikes at the start of 2022. Bitcoin\u2019s Pearson correlation, which measures the 30-day correlation to Bitcoin for S&P 500 and gold, dropped to 0.20 \u2013 the lowest ever,\u201c wrote Stadelmann, adding that this suggests investors are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset.\n\nMarat Minkin, the co-founder of DeFi payment app TONBanking, said that Bitcoin\u2019s rally was also attributed to Binance chief Changpeng Zhao denying the allegations against his exchange.\n\n\u201cThis report was a relief to investors and the market and Bitcoin continued the uptrend. The U.S. dollar index\u2019s continued decline also supported the crypto uptrend. The decline of the U.S. dollar index and the fear of higher inflation and recession, prompted investors to look for short-term investment opportunities,\u201d wrote Minkin.\n\nOver 74% of all Bitcoin supply was in profit as of March 29, according to CryptoQuant, suggesting that investors may be looking to sell some of their holdings to take profits.\n\nOver US$76.8 million worth of Bitcoin options across all exchanges are set to expire on Friday, according to data from derivatives exchange data aggregator Coinglass. Options enable purchasers to buy or sell the underlying asset at a set price by a fixed date and are used to speculate on future price movement or hedge risk.\n\nStadelmann said that this signals increasing interest in Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin investors are opening up new positions in the Bitcoin futures market, which could lead to more volatility \u2013 albeit most likely to the upside over the medium term. In the past few days, Bitcoin\u2019s 30 days SMA Open Interest has dramatically increased to approximately US$8.6 billion,\u201d wrote Stadelmann.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.18 trillion on Friday at 9:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 0.85% from US$1.17 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$546 billion market cap accounted for 46.3% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$219 billion accounted for 18.5%.\n\nRuslan Sharov, the chief executive officer and co-founder of GameFi video platform Cheelee, said that Bitcoin\u2019s rising dominance suggests investor caution.\n\n\u201cWe see the continuous growth of Bitcoin dominance, which signals a more conservative outlook on the general perspective of the crypto market on the investors\u2019 side. Bitcoin is likely considered a safe harbor to wait out the storm until the general sentiment turns more optimistic,\u201d wrote Sharov.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin keeps its head held high despite options expiration\n\nBiggest gainers: XRP & CFX\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. XRP rose 23.96% to trade at US$0.53. XRP started picking up momentum on March 20, after Ripple Labs made a new filing to back its case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nCFX, the utility token of Conflux Network, China\u2019s only public blockchain, was the second biggest gainer in the top 100, rising 19.5% to change hands at US$0.40. The token started picking up momentum on Tuesday, as part of a larger rally that saw the token rise over 1,750% from the beginning of the year.\n\nNext week\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s current support checks in at approximately US$25,000. If it tests this over the next two weekly closes, that would suggest a potential bullish pattern. On the upside, Bitcoin\u2019s current resistance is US$30,000,\u201d wrote Stadelmann.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s funding ratio has been at a relatively high positive value, suggesting there are more long positions compared to short positions. This would suggest increased prices, although investors do have some concerns over Bitcoin\u2019s overall liquidity. The US$30,000 handle could prove to be tough resistance for Bitcoin, at least in the short term,\u201c added Stadelmann.\n\nSharov said that we may be witnessing the start of a long-term Bitcoin rally, despite short-term volatility.\n\n\u201cI believe the next crucial resistance point is at US$30,000 and it appears to be a major psychological hurdle. Another important factor is the macro-economical landscape. Considering the number of ongoing triggers, I expect the market to appear strongly contingent upon the financial news that surfaces over the following week,\u201d wrote Sharov.\n\nSee related article: Crypto investors remain optimistic despite crackdown"

When you look at the inception of this ETF, it\u2019s actually down 75%,\u201d Lydon said. \u201cHowever, if you look at year to date, this ETF and Bitcoin itself is up almost 70% off of the recent lows, so it\u2019s encouraging.\u201d\n\nLydon said bitcoin has demonstrated it\u2019s not going away, earnings a role as its own asset class and something worth paying attention to. As the fund moves above its 200-day moving average, it\u2019s worth consideration.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at trends, and you look at alternatives to what\u2019s going on in the equity markets, the fixed income markets, currencies, banking, there\u2019s also an opportunity to diversify and have non correlated assets as well,\u201d Lydon said. \u201cSo with all that in mind, having an ETF regardless of what it covers, or regardless what its name is, if it goes above its [moving]average, this is something to consider for your portfolio.\u201d\n\nBITO notably does not offer exposure to spot bitcoin but rather bitcoin futures, as the SEC has not approved spot bitcoin or cryptocurrency ETFs. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler approved a futures-based strategy as the CFTC futures are regulated, enhancing the products reception with regulators.\n\n\u201cAnd guess what? it\u2019s worked,\u201d Lydon said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s been down this much, it has been exactly correlated with the performance of Bitcoin \u2014 and that\u2019s what everybody wanted.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lydon, the idea here is that, with BITO and bitcoin going above its 20-day moving average, investors have the opportunity to buy in low with the ability to protect themselves if it turns around and dips below its trendline."

        "content": "An active-duty United States Space Force astronautical engineer is proposing a cybersecurity tool to the Pentagon that is capable of transforming the country\u2019s national security and the base-layer architecture of the internet: Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn an academic thesis, Major Jason Lowery, who is also a national defense fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), presented a new theory to the U.S. Department of Defense that Bitcoin is not just a peer-to-peer payment system but a new form of \u201cdigital-age warfare,\u201d arguing that proof-of-work technologies will change the way humans compete globally, according to Ben Schreckinger\u2019s review of the book in Politico.\n\nPublished in February, Lowery\u2019s master\u2019s degree thesis dubbed \u201cSoftwar\u201d sits in third position on Amazon\u2019s list of best-selling technology books at the time of writing. According to his Amazon bio, Lowery has a decade of experience serving as a weapon system developer and technical adviser for U.S. senior officials, including Bitcoin-related policies.\n\nRelated: Proof-of-Work, Explained\n\nLowery\u2019s research argues that the U.S. military could use Bitcoin to stop certain types of attacks, such as denial-of-service attacks, which overload servers with too many requests. The concept involves creating software programs that only respond to signals from large transactions recorded on the Bitcoin network. This would make it harder for attackers to flood servers with fake signals and cause damage.\n\nTHESIS PUBLISHED!!!\n\n\n\nAnnouncing the public debut of SOFTWAR, a theory presented to OPOTUS, OSECDEF, & the Joint Chiefs about the national strategic significance of #Bitcoin\n\n\n\nLET THE HASH WARS BEGIN\n\n\n\nHigh-quality physical copies available now:https://t.co/WaNo7y8avl pic.twitter.com/vWF24ze9EA \u2014 Jason Lowery (@JasonPLowery) February 20, 2023\n\nLowery also suggests that the Bitcoin network is like maritime trade routes, which means it\u2019s suited for economic exchange. Consequently, it\u2019s crucial to protect freedom of navigation on the network, just as we protect trade routes.\n\nBy designing software programs that only respond to external signals if they come with a large enough Bitcoin transaction recorded on the network, Lowery argues they would prevent adversaries from gaining control over them.\n\nAccording to the author, the U.S. should also stockpile Bitcoin, build a domestic Bitcoin mining industry and extend legal protections to the technology. In his view, Bitcoin is a self-defense weapon, and the country should protect it as it does other rights.\n\nMagazine: Can Bitcoin survive a Carrington Event knocking out the grid?"

        "content": "The Justices of the Supreme Court of Denmark have handed down two judgements on whether the sale of Bitcoin (BTC) under certain circumstances qualifies as a taxable event.\n\nIn a March 30 notice, Denmark\u2019s Supreme Court said a party who gained profits from selling Bitcoin acquired through several purchases and donations was required to report the sale as a taxable event, adding the purchase was \u201cmade for the purpose of speculation.\u201d In a separate case, the court ruled a user who mined their own BTC and later sold the coins would be subject to the same tax consideration.\n\nBoth cases considered by the supreme court involved the acquisition of BTC between 2011 and 2013, with sales between 2017 and 2018, suggesting a price difference in the thousands of dollars. The court cited sections of the country\u2019s National Tax Act, noting it had considered the first seller\u2019s intent to eventually sell the coins based on a post in a 2011 Bitcoin forum.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court finds that the received Bitcoins must be considered assets acquired with a view to later turnover as an integrated part of [the first party]\u2019s business with the development and operation of software for Bitcoins,\u201d said the ruling. \u201cThey cannot be considered at the time of sale to have been transferred to be [their] private property or assets. On that basis, the Supreme Court finds that the relinquishment of the Bitcoins received constituted revenue in [their] non-commercial business. Sales therefore trigger tax liability.\u201d\n\nRelated: What is crypto tax-loss harvesting, and how does it work?\n\nCoincub reported in September 2022 that gains earned from crypto in Denmark could incur a tax rate of roughly 37% but also up to 52% depending on whether the user has a high income. This would place the country well above crypto tax rates in the United States subject to its capital gains laws \u2014 between 0% and 37% depending on whether the taxpayer sells assets held for more or less than a year and their income bracket.\n\nMagazine: Best and worst countries for crypto taxes \u2014 Plus crypto tax tips"

        "content": "The growing hype surrounding Ordinals has established Bitcoin as an emerging frontier for trading digital collectibles. And as the landscape develops, the Solana-based NFT marketplace Magic Eden has quickly emerged as a new leader.\n\nOrdinals\u2014a protocol that enables content like art and text to be inscribed on individual satoshis, the smallest unit of measure that Bitcoin can be divided into\u2014has exploded in popularity since it was introduced in January as traders and developers grow more familiar with NFT-like assets called inscriptions.\n\nMagic Eden opened the door to trading inscriptions just over a week ago, on March 21, and has grown to represent a majority of Ordinals trading volume across various marketplaces that support them as of yesterday, according to a Dune dashboard created by a pseudonymous on-chain data enthusiast named Domo.\n\nOrdinals marketplaces have now seen: - $15.65m volume\n\n- 38.3k trades\n\n- 18.46k users Several players are now established in the space - including @OrdinalsMarket_, @ordswap, @MagicEden & others Killer dash by @domodata \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0fhttps://t.co/R0yfck13GO \u2014 Dune (@DuneAnalytics) March 30, 2023\n\nOn Tuesday, Magic Eden racked up roughly $170,000 worth of inscription sales compared to around $72,000 on the second most popular marketplace, Ordinals Wallet.\n\nBTC DeGods, a collection of inscriptions released by the creators of the most valuable Solana NFT profile picture (PFP) project, has played an influential role in Magic Eden\u2019s ascension to the top, Domo told Decrypt via Twitter message.\n\nStory continues\n\n'Bitcoin Is the Best Brand in Crypto': Why DeGods NFTs Are Now on Bitcoin\n\nThe Bitcoin-based collection of profile pictures has notched nearly 35 BTC, or almost $1 million worth of total trading volume since it was released, with the cheapest inscription hovering around $23,000 worth of BTC as of this writing, according to Magic Eden.\n\nMagic Eden still lags behind Ordinals Wallet in terms of total daily transactions, although the trend over the past week suggests that Magic Eden is chipping away at that lead. Yesterday, 404 inscriptions were traded on Magic Eden while Ordinals Wallet facilitated 543 sales, according to Domo\u2019s dashboard.\n\nIn other words, Magic Eden is handling higher-value Ordinals sales. And the long-standing link between DeGods and Magic Eden on Solana\u2014even though DeGods is about to migrate from Solana to Ethereum\u2014may be translating over to Bitcoin as traders flock to the well-known marketplace\u2019s latest incarnation.\n\nWhen Magic Eden launched in 2021, it started out as a marketplace that solely supported NFTs created on Solana. But over time, the marketplace has added support for NFTs on other blockchains such as Ethereum and Polygon, the latter an Ethereum scaling network.\n\nWe built our Bitcoin marketplace in a month. To take it across the finish line, we rented a giant Airbnb in California and brought over a dozen devs together. As a mostly remote company, we're proud to share some of our faces and tell our story.\n\nBIG thank you to @bhammers for\u2026 pic.twitter.com/3Pu5zzXZ1u \u2014 Magic Eden \ud83e\ude84 (@MagicEden) March 22, 2023\n\n\"We hope to continue to see both creator and user growth on Ordinals,\" Magic Eden Head of Marketing Tiffany Huang told Decrypt. \"A lot of creators I talk to are definitely interested and exploring it, especially after knowing high-value names like Yuga and DeGods are involved.\"\n\nFor a user base that\u2019s already familiar with trading collectibles across multiple networks, Magic Eden traders' swift embrace of inscriptions on Bitcoin makes sense, according to Domo.\n\n\u201cTheir user base is typically open to being multi-chain, so the prospect of a new chain isn\u2019t daunting to them,\u201d Domo told Decrypt.\n\nMagic Eden Launches Ordinals Marketplace for Bitcoin NFTs\n\nMagic Eden\u2019s ability to corner the market for inscriptions quickly is also a function of its status as an established marketplace, compared to other trading venues that have cropped up only recently and are limited to Bitcoin, Domo added.\n\nAt the same time, Magic Eden is only the first among mainstream marketplaces to support inscriptions. And as Magic Eden has itself experienced in the past on Solana, even upstart rivals can quickly eat away at market dominance. But for now, at least, Magic Eden is commanding the most Ordinals trading volume."

        "content": "Since May 2022, the Bitcoin (BTC) margin markets on the Bitfinex exchange have been plagued by an unusually high open interest of over $2.7 billion. This information alone should raise a red flag, especially considering Bitcoin\u2019s price decline from $39,000 to less than $25,000 during the same period.\n\nTraders seeking to leverage their cryptocurrency position had borrowed over 105,000 Bitcoin. Currently, the cause of this anomaly and the number of entities involved in the trade are unknown.\n\nCheap borrowing favors high demand\n\nBitfinex\u2019s sub-0.1% annual rate may contribute to the size of the Bitcoin lending market. To date, this has been the norm, creating enormous incentives for borrowing, even if there is no current need. Few traders would turn down such a ridiculously inexpensive leverage opportunity.\n\nMargin borrowing can be used to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities, where a trader exploits price discrepancies between different markets. For example, borrowing Bitcoin on margin allows a trader to take a long position in one market and a short one in another, profiting from the price difference.\n\nTo understand how Bitcoin borrowing can be used to profit on derivatives markets, including those outside of Bitfinex, one must understand the distinction between futures contracts and margin markets. The margin is not a derivative contract, so the trade occurs on the same order book as spot trading. In addition, unlike futures, margin longs and shorts are not always in balance.\n\nFor example, after purchasing 10 Bitcoin using margin, the coins can be withdrawn from the exchange. Naturally, the trade, typically based on stablecoins, requires some form of collateral or a margin deposit.\n\nIf the borrower fails to return the position, the exchange will liquidate the margin to repay the lender.\n\nAdditionally, the borrower must pay interest on the BTC acquired with a margin. The operational procedures vary between centralized and decentralized exchanges, but the lender typically determines the interest rate and duration of offers.\n\nThere was a 12,000 BTC margin decline in a single trade\n\nHistorically, Bitfinex margin traders have been known to move large margin positions quickly, indicating the participation of whales and large arbitrage desks. In the most recent instance, on March 25, those investors reduced their long positions by 12,000 BTC in minutes.\n\nBitfinex BTC margin longs, in BTC contracts. Source: TradingView\n\nNotice the significant decrease, although it did not affect the Bitcoin price. This supports the theory that such margin trades are market-neutral because the borrower is not leveraging their positions with the proceeds. Most likely, there is some arbitrage involving derivatives instruments.\n\nTraders should cross-reference the data with other exchanges to confirm that the anomaly affects the entire market, given that each exchange has distinct risks, norms, liquidity and availability.\n\nOKX, for example, provides an indicator for margin lending based on the stablecoin/BTC ratio. Traders can increase their exposure on OKX by borrowing stablecoins to purchase Bitcoin. Bitcoin borrowers, on the other hand, can only wager on the price decline.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin lending ratio has been stable for the past week near 30, indicating that professional traders\u2019 long-to-short bets have not changed. This data supports the theory that Bitfinex\u2019s decline is due to an arbitrage close unrelated to Bitcoin price movement.\n\nRelated: US government plans to sell 41K Bitcoin connected to Silk Road\n\nRecent crypto bank closures could have triggered the movement\n\nAnother possibility for the sudden decrease in margin demand is the $4 billion deposits associated with the now-defunct Signature Bank. Crypto clients were told to close their accounts by April, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nWhile New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) purchased the majority of Signature Bank\u2019s deposits and loans on March 19, the deal with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation did not include crypto-related accounts.\n\nIf those whales are forced to close their banking accounts, they will most likely reduce their arbitrage positions, including those in margin markets. For the time being, all assumptions are speculative, but one thing is sure: the 12,000 BTC long margin reduction at Bitfinex did not affect Bitcoin prices.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Regulation continues to be the primary concern for Bitcoin bulls, especially after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance for trading and derivatives law violations. The regulator wants Binance to repay the trading profits, revenues, salaries, commissions, loans and fees it received from United States citizens, as well as paying civil penalties for the violations.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) rise was also fueled by a shift in sentiment toward risk assets after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said interest rate hikes are no longer the default move to curb inflation. The central bank understood that the current situation will likely \u201cresult in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes.\u201d\n\nFixed-income investors earn more when interest rates rise, so buying stocks and commodities becomes less appealing. As a result, by reversing the strategy and adding $339 billion in liabilities in two weeks, the Fed chose to contain the banking crisis, which may cause inflation to spiral out of control.\n\nGiven the accretive scenario for risk assets, Bitcoin bulls can profit up to $1.4 billion in Friday's monthly options expiry.\n\nBitcoin bears were caught completely off-guard\n\nThe open interest for the March 31 options expiry is $4.2 billion, but the actual figure will be lower since bears were expecting sub-$26,500 price levels. These traders were caught by surprise as Bitcoin gained 32% between March 12 and March 17.\n\nBitcoin options aggregate open interest for March 31. Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe 1.34 call-to-put ratio reflects the imbalance between the $2.4 billion call (buy) open interest and the $1.8 billion put (sell) options. However, if Bitcoin's price remains near $28,000 at 8:00 am UTC on March 31, only $25 million worth of these put (sell) options will be available. This difference happens because the right to sell Bitcoin at $26,000 or $27,000 is useless if BTC trades above that level on expiry.\n\nBulls aim for $29,000 to secure a record-breaking $1.4 billion profit\n\nBelow are the four most likely scenarios based on the current price action. The number of options contracts available on March 31 for call (bull) and put (bear) instruments varies, depending on the expiry price. The imbalance favoring each side constitutes the theoretical profit:\n\nBetween $25,000 and $26,000: 27,200 calls vs. 12,700 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $360 million.\n\n27,200 calls vs. 12,700 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $360 million. Between $26,000 and $27,000: 32,300 calls vs. 8,500 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $620 million.\n\n32,300 calls vs. 8,500 puts. The net result favors the call (bull) instruments by $620 million. Between $27,000 and $28,000: 38,100 calls vs. 3,000 puts. Bulls increase their advantage to $1.2 billion.\n\n38,100 calls vs. 3,000 puts. Bulls increase their advantage to $1.2 billion. Between $28,000 and $30,000: 48,300 calls vs. 400 puts. Bulls dominate by profiting $1.4 billion.\n\nThis crude estimate considers the call options used in bullish bets and the put options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. Even so, this oversimplification disregards more complex investment strategies.\n\nFor example, a trader could have sold a call option, effectively gaining negative exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price, but unfortunately, there's no easy way to estimate this effect.\n\nRelated: \u2018Definitely not bullish\u2019 \u2014 7% Bitcoin price gains fail to convince traders\n\nThe bears best hope relies on regulatory FUD\n\nBitcoin bulls must push the price above $29,000 by March 31 to secure a potential $1.4 billion profit. Bear's best shot, on the other hand, is more regulatory FUD about stablecoins or major crypto exchanges \u2014 which has so far been fruitless.\n\nConsidering the bullish momentum created by the Fed's inability to continue raising interest rates, bulls are well positioned for the March BTC monthly options expiry. Most likely, those profits will be used to further strengthen the $28,000 support, so the expected outcome is especially concerning for bears.\n\nBitcoin has been hovering around $28,000 for the past ten days, but the cryptocurrency has gained 70.5% year to date. Until March 17, Bitcoin was trading below $25,000 and this explains why most bearish bets for March\u2019s $4.2 billion options expiry were placed at $26,500 or lower.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "As discussed in Part I of this series, Ordinals are a pioneering new method of utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain that will usher in new and innovative use cases on Bitcoin. As promised, in Part II we will discuss the implications for creators and owners.\n\nImplications of Ordinal NFTs for Creators and Owners\n\nAs with most crypto innovation, capable users quickly flocked to the shiny new object. Copies of popular Ethereum NFT projects began appearing on the Bitcoin blockchain after the Ordinals launch. For example, a clone of CryptoPunks, named Ordinal Punks, popped up and is reportedly gaining traction. Further, the owner of Bored Ape Yacht Club (\u201cBAYC\u201d) #1626 permanently removed the NFT from its spot as one of the most valuable in the space by \u201cburning\u201d it, then inscribing the NFT on Bitcoin using Ordinals. While the owner of BAYC #1626 effectively deleted \u2013 or symbolically transferred \u2013 the NFT, it appears that some NFT creators are not purists and are willing to experiment on Bitcoin. For example, Yuga Labs, the creator behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club Ethereum-based NFT phenomenon, announced that it would release a NFT project called TwelveFold on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn our December article we asked: what do hard forks mean for my NFTs? In this article we ask a similar question: how does a copy of an NFT on completely different chain (Bitcoin, not Ethereum), affect value and licenses?\n\nA number of questions arise. Does the holder of the copycat Ordinal on Bitcoin require a license corresponding to the Ethereum NFT? What happens to the Ethereum NFT purchaser\u2019s rights granted to it under the license, which may or may not include a commercial right to exploit and sublicense? Does an Ordinal inscription of an Ethereum NFT fall under a purchaser\u2019s general non-commercial use and public display rights that are generally given to purchasers on NFT marketplaces? Does the original Ethereum NFT holder hold one set of rights and the holder of the copycat on Ordinals possess any rights that may be in conflict with the original NFT holder\u2019s? Generally speaking, would the value of the NFT be affected if two identical copies exist on two different blockchains? Does the NFT owner or project have a say in which blockchain to recognize? Has any IP infringement occurred?\n\nThese rights are not insignificant, as the holder, depending on the license grant, is typically permitted to display or otherwise use the NFT in a non-commercial manner, and, in some cases, may even be able to commercially exploit, or grant a person(s) the right to commercially exploit, the NFT. Understanding what bundle of rights, and whether others share that bundle, is helpful to valuing the NFT and its underlying IP, as well as brand building.\n\nAs with everything in the constantly-evolving cryptosphere, there will be variability in how licensing agreements these issues. Certain licensing agreements may offer clues for how this issue may be handled. For instance, the terms of one NFT marketplace, Rarible\u2019s Standard Collectibles Sale and License Agreement (the \u201cRaribles Agreement\u201d), indicates that it only recognizes NFTs on Ethereum:\n\n\u201c Collectible \u201d means the combination of: (A) an Ethereum-based NFT having a Uniform Resource Identifier (\u201cURI\u201d) identifying an appropriately configured JSON file conforming to the ERC-721 Metadata JSON Schema, ERC-1155 Metadata URI JSON Schema or a similar JSON schema, as applicable (such JSON file, the \u201d Collectible ID\u201d); and (B) the Collectible Metadata specified by such Collectible ID.\u201d\n\n[While the Rarible\u2019s Agreement only recognizes Ethereum-based NFTs, the Agreement does recognize NFTs on each chain after a hard fork]:\n\n\u201c Collector \u201d of a Collectible means at each time, the person who lawfully holds exclusive title to and ownership of the NFT included in such Collectible, for so long as such person continues to hold such title to and ownership of such NFT. All references to \u201cCollector\u201d include the Collector\u2019s lawful permitted successors and assigns. In the event of an Ethereum Persistent Fork creating copies of the Collectibles at the same addresses at which they were then held on Ethereum, the scope of the term \u201cCollector,\u201d and all licenses granted to and other rights of a Collector under these Terms, shall be deemed expanded to include each person who lawfully holds exclusive title to and ownership of the copies of such NFTs that are included on the Ethereum Persistent Fork. The parties acknowledge and agree that, as a result of the preceding sentence, in an Ethereum Persistent Fork, the aggregate number of the Collectibles may be increased, which could have an adverse effect on the value of each Collectible or the aggregate value of the total Collectibles.\n\nThis raises a second question, what would be the effect be if the Rarible\u2019s Agreement (or any other similar terms of service on an NFT marketplace) was modified to permit an increase in the aggregate number of collectibles as a result of a new enablement on a new protocol, similar to how Rarible\u2019s treats a hard fork?\n\nLike Rarible\u2019s, Yuga Labs, a Web3 developer of NFTs \u2013 including CryptoPunks and BAYCs \u2013 provides a warranty disclaimer that each CryptoPunk NFT exists only by virtue of the ownership record on the Ethereum Blockchain:\n\nEACH CRYPTOPUNK NFT IS AN INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSET THAT EXISTS ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED ON THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN. ANY TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN ANY UNIQUE DIGITAL ASSET OCCURS ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN THE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN, WHICH YUGA LABS DOES NOT CONTROL.\n\nBAYCs includes a similar provision in the Ownership section. As such, under these terms, Yuga Labs has de facto designated Ethereum as its blockchain of choice. However, whereas Rarible\u2019s licensing agreement may result in doubling the amount of \u201cCollectibles\u201d in the event of a fork, Yuga Labs, a Web3 developer of NFTs, reserves the right to designate which fork is valid for their notable Cryptopunks:\n\nThe License applies only to the CryptoPunk NFT on the blockchain that Yuga, in its sole discretion, may designate, which designation shall apply retroactively. Thus, for example, if a fork or other event purports to result in duplicate CryptoPunk NFTs, only the non-fungible token recorded on the blockchain designated by Yuga Labs will be eligible to receive the benefit of the License. Any license purportedly granted hereunder to the owner of a non-fungible token recorded on a blockchain not designated by YugaLabs is void ab initio.\n\nThus, in addition to stating that CryptoPunks exist by virtue of the digital asset record on Ethereum, Yuga labs may designate the blockchain where CryptoPunks exist. In terms of forking, Yuga Labs\u2019 approach is similar to venture capital firm a16z\u2019s approach, which provided five template NFT licenses, each providing for the industry-recognized chain post-fork, merge or duplication.\n\nTransfer and Sublicensing . The licenses granted in these Terms are non-transferrable, except that if you lawfully transfer ownership of your Project NFT, the license to the NFT Media in Section 1.1 to you shall terminate upon the effective date of such transfer, and such licenses will be assigned to the new owner of the Project NFT associated with such NFT Media. As a condition to sales, transfers or similar transactions of the Project NFTs, the transferee agrees upon the acquisition of the Project NFT that (a) the transferee is not a Restricted Party and (b) the transferee accepts these Terms. Further, if you choose to sublicense any of your licensed rights set forth in Section 1.1 above, you are only permitted to do so if any such sublicensees agree (i) that they are not Restricted Parties, (ii) to the same covenant not to assert as set forth in the second to last sentence of Section 1.2, and (iii) that if your licensed rights in Section 1.1 are transferred (such as because you sell your Project NFT), then any such sublicenses you have granted in such licensed rights will automatically terminate. Because virtually all public blockchains are licensed under open source licenses, it is possible that the blockchain may fork, merge, or duplicate the original blockchain that initially recorded ownership of your Project NFT. In such case, any rights granted under these Terms to owners of any Project NFT will only be granted to the lawful owners of such Project NFT whose ownership is recorded on the mainnet version of the blockchain that is generally recognized and predominantly supported in the blockchain industry as the legitimate successor of the original blockchain (as determined in our sole discretion).\n\nHowever, under this version of the a16z NFT license, a16z does not specify that the only valid ownership ledger is on Ethereum, so arguably the licensing agreement may be used with respect to an Ordinal inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain. Further, Bitcoin is neither a fork from, a merge into, nor a duplication of Ethereum, and the license is silent on NFT copies; however, the clear emphasis is that IP licenses will only be granted to the lawful owners of a project on a \u201cblockchain that is generally recognized and predominantly supported as the legitimate successor of the original blockchain\u201d as determined in the sole discretion of the Creator. It is an open question whether this language would give holders comfort if the argument could be made that their licenses are protected against copycats on a completely separate chain, like Bitcoin.\n\nAlternatively, as a creator may reserve the right to upgrade the NFT\u2019s smart contract in the case of a fork, reserve the right to declare future restrictions on the NFTs use, or stay silent altogether, a creator may also decide to jump entirely to a separate chain. In the absence of a licensing agreement or specific guidelines, Archer v. Coinbase, Inc., 53 Cal. App. 5th 266 (2020), provides some clarity as to how new chains may be handled. In Archer, a user claimed that a cryptocurrency exchange was required to provide him access to all forked versions of the Bitcoin in his exchange account. The California state court disagreed, reasoning that the exchange\u2019s user agreement did not obligate the exchange to support all forks. The court also found that Coinbase\u2019s refusal to support a new form of forked cryptocurrency was not action amounting to conversion as Coinbase did not host the forked cryptocurrency in the first instance, and thus could not have deprived the plaintiff of a property right or exercised dominion over the forked cryptocurrency. Consequently, digital asset trading platforms (token, NFT, or otherwise) tend to expressly reserve the ability to determine which forks they support or otherwise reserve the broad right to place future restrictions on transactions.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will become a widely popular chain for NFT enthusiastic and projects. In any event, the revolutionary capabilities enabled by Ordinals bring up novel questions surrounding NFTs and licensing agreements, so NFT issuers and marketplaces should consider what effect Ordinals might have on their business models and also reexamine relevant terms as needed to take into account any future NFT-enabled blockchains.\n\n[View source.]"

        "title": "Is Bitcoin Safe? What To Know - GOBankingRates",
        "content": "May Lim / iStock.com\n\nBitcoin and its cryptocurrency brethren have made headlines for years now. Fortunes have been made \u2014 and quite often, lost \u2014 investing in cryptocurrency, and that may not change in the near future. Proponents of cryptocurrency see it as the currency of the future, co-existing with or even supplanting government-issued currency, while detractors think that crypto has no future at all.\n\nCombined with the speculative passion with which traders buy and sell crypto, it\u2019s no wonder that crypto prices are constantly engaged in a volatile tug of war.\n\nIs Bitcoin Safe?\n\nAgainst this backdrop, bitcoin is something of an \u201cold guard,\u201d being the first, oldest and by far the largest cryptocurrency. To some degree, this gives bitcoin an added level of \u201csafety,\u201d but that word must be used cautiously. Bitcoin itself has numerous risks that make it anything but \u201csafe\u201d when compared with more traditional investments like bonds or even stocks.\n\nHere are the most important aspects of investing in bitcoin that you need to know as an investor to help you determine just how \u201csafe\u201d it may be in your portfolio.\n\nInherent Value\n\nBitcoin is unique in the investment world in that it has no inherent value. Bitcoin was essentially created out of thin air, and it isn\u2019t backed by earnings or profits \u2014 like the stock market \u2014 or the promise of a corporation or government that it would make payments \u2014 like a bond.\n\nEven options and other derivatives, which technically don\u2019t have their own pure value, derive a value from their connections to other securities.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Value\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, only has value because investors buy it in the belief that its price will rise in the future. There are many reasons behind this support, from the belief that crypto will become legitimized to pure speculative frenzy.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nBut as an investor, you have to come to terms with the fact that you\u2019ll be buying an investment that has no inherent value to fall back on.\n\nVolatility\n\nYou\u2019ll definitely need a strong stomach to invest in a cryptocurrency like bitcoin. Thanks to a number of factors, the price of bitcoin can fluctuate wildly. A look at the history of the annual returns of bitcoin only shows part of the story, but it\u2019s still telling.\n\nPrice Fluctuations\n\nSince its inception in 2009, the smallest annual variation in bitcoin\u2019s price was the 35% gain it posted in 2015. But bitcoin\u2019s biggest annual gain was 2010, when it returned an astronomical 30,203%.\n\nWhile that sounds like the type of return that any investor would crave, you have to factor in volatility on the downside, as well. In three separate years, Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped by more than 60%, topped by its massive 73% loss in 2018.\n\nHype, Speculation and Promotion\n\nMore than any other asset class, cryptocurrency is subject to hype, speculation and promotion. As cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have no inherent value, they can only gain in price when investors buy more in the belief that others will follow and it will go higher.\n\nEntire message boards are devoted to hyping up cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, with rumors flying fast and furious. It can be hard to determine which message posts or \u201cnews items\u201d are real and which are simply the work of speculators trying to manipulate the stock higher. This makes an investment in bitcoin inherently risky.\n\nTaxation\n\nMany of the speculators buying and selling bitcoin \u2014 or even those using it for everyday transactions like buying coffee \u2014 may not be aware of the tax obligations associated with bitcoin.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nCapital Gains Taxes\n\nFrom the investment side, the IRS considers bitcoin to be a capital asset, the same as a stock. In other words, when you buy and sell bitcoin, you\u2019re responsible for reporting those transactions when you file your taxes \u2014 and you\u2019ll owe taxes on any capital gains you generate.\n\nCapital Transactions\n\nBeyond buying and selling bitcoin as an investment, however, the IRS also considers using bitcoin to purchase other goods to be a taxable transaction as well. From the perspective of the IRS, when you use bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee, for example, you are converting your bitcoin into something else of value. In fact, technically you are exchanging your bitcoin for dollars and then using those dollars to buy that cup of coffee.\n\nIf the value of your bitcoin at the time of the transaction is higher than it was when you bought it, it\u2019s a taxable capital transaction \u2014 the same as if you simply bought and then sold your bitcoin on the open market.\n\nCybersecurity\n\nCybersecurity is a serious issue when it comes to bitcoin, and it\u2019s a different type of risk that you\u2019ll have to understand as an investor. As bitcoin is an intangible, digital asset, it must be stored somewhere electronically.\n\nWhile there are different types of wallets and storage options for your bitcoin, at the end of the day, all digital assets and storage systems are subject to cyber theft. While you can take steps to secure your bitcoin in the best way possible, cybersecurity may always be a concern.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nCompetition\n\nAll capital assets rely on the principles of supply and demand to derive their value. But as bitcoin has no tangible earnings or value behind it, if the hype and hope behind it vanish, the price of bitcoin could plummet. What is one of the things that may draw buyers away from bitcoin? Competition.\n\nOther Cryptocurrencies\n\nThere are literally thousands of other cryptocurrencies in existence, and new ones are being created constantly. While bitcoin remains the elephant in the space, if a developer creates an all-encompassing cryptocurrency that meets the demands, hopes and dreams of crypto buyers, it\u2019s possible that support for bitcoin will wane.\n\nIn that scenario, bitcoin could be relegated to a historical footnote, a \u201cfirst mover\u201d that started an industry but ultimately couldn\u2019t keep up with the latest developments.\n\nHow Can You Mitigate the Risk?\n\nWhile there is no way to make bitcoin a completely safe investment, there are a few things you can do to reduce the risk for yourself.\n\nStore your bitcoin securely. A cold wallet, or hardware wallet, is the safest place to keep your crypto, followed by a hot wallet. Storing your bitcoin on an exchange is the least secure option.\n\nA cold wallet, or hardware wallet, is the safest place to keep your crypto, followed by a hot wallet. Storing your bitcoin on an exchange is the least secure option. Don\u2019t invest too much. No matter how tempting it is to pour all of your funds into cryptocurrency when you hear stories of crypto millionaires, never invest more than you can afford to lose \u2014 because you just might.\n\nNo matter how tempting it is to pour all of your funds into cryptocurrency when you hear stories of crypto millionaires, never invest more than you can afford to lose \u2014 because you just might. Avoid scams. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Make sure you do your research before you invest.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis list of the risks of bitcoin is by no means complete. For example, numerous governments around the world are discussing creating their own digital coins, and some have even tossed around the idea of making cryptocurrency illegal. The failure of crypto exchanges like FTX are also a big risk.\n\nBut as an investor, you\u2019ll have to weigh all of these dangers against the enormous profit potential that cryptos like bitcoin have exhibited in the past. Whether or not those outsized gains will be available to investors in the future is unknown \u2014 that is why there is a market, after all \u2014 but it\u2019s something to consider if you\u2019re looking into owning or trading bitcoin.\n\nFAQ Here are some quick answers to common questions about bitcoin's safety. What are the risks of using bitcoin? Among the top risks of investing in bitcoin are its volatility, the fact that it has no inherent value and the ever-present concern of cybersecurity.\n\nIs bitcoin safe and legal? Bitcoin cannot be considered a safe investment, though it can offer high returns. As for its legality, bitcoin is legal in many places, but it is illegal in several countries, including China, and more governments are considering making its use illegal.\n\nIs bitcoin safer than money? No, bitcoin is not safer than money. It is not regulated and it's uninsured, meaning that if you're storing it in an exchange that fails, you could simply lose your entire investment \u2013 unlike most bank accounts, which are insured up to $250,000 per depositor by the FDIC. Even if you store your bitcoin in a cold wallet \u2013 the safest storage option \u2013 it could lose most of its value very quickly, leaving you with nothing to show for your investment. While you might consider investing in some bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, it would be unwise to put all your cash into crypto.\n\nCan you lose money on bitcoin?

        "title": "Cryptocurrency Market Recovers: Bitcoin Price Rebounds to $14000 on Christmas - CCN.com",
        "content": "On December 25, Christmas day, the bitcoin price rebounded to $14,000 after recording a major correction that sent its value plummeting to $11,500.\n\nBitcoin Optimistic Short-Term Price Trend\n\nOverall, the cryptocurrency market recovered from a correction that occured on December 23, in merely 48 hours. Two days ago, every single cryptocurrency in the market ranging from bitcoin to SingularDTV declined by nearly 50 percent, as the cryptocurrency market lost over $100 billion of its valuation.\n\nToday, the cryptocurrency market cap surged from $488 billion to $550 billion, demonstrating signs of recovery for the first time since last week Tuesday.\n\nBitcoin recorded a price increase of around 6 percent, with over $10 billion daily trading volume spread across USD-to-BTC and KRW-to-BTC trading platforms such as Bitfinex, Bithumb, Binance, and GDAX.\n\nOKEx, the Hong Kong branch of OKCoin, previously the largest cryptocurrency exchange in China before the crackdown on cryptocurrency trading initiated by the Chinese government, processed around 2.4 percent of global bitcoin trades throughout the past three days, solidifying itself as a leading cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nOther leading Chinese exchanges BTCC and Huobi have also started to process large volumes of trades. Given that OKEx, BTCC, and Huobi Pro have migrated their businesses to Hong Kong, in the upcoming months, analysts predict the Hong Kong market to evolve into a major bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange market.\n\nIn South Korea and Japan, bitcoin is still being traded with high premiums. On Bithumb, South Korea\u2019s largest and the global market\u2019s second biggest exchange, the bitcoin price is being traded at nearly $18,000, with a $3,000 premium, while leading markets like the US are processing bitcoin trades at around $14,500.\n\nCryptocurrency Market Recovers\n\nEthereum, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Monero, and Zcash have also recorded major gains over the past 24 hours, with Ethereum and Zcash rising by 15 percent and 20 percent respectively. Analysts have attributed the recent recovery of the cryptocurrency market to Christmas and the upcoming New Year\u2019s, as the gathering of families, relatives, and friends has historically led to the surge in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the market.\n\nThroughout the holidays, the demand for bitcoin will likely continue to skyrocket as new individual investors become introduced to the new asset class that is bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Earlier today, Investopedia, an online dictionary platform for finance keywords, stated that bitcoin has been named the term of the year.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is named \u2018Term of the Year\u2019 by Investopedia as measured by search volume and percentage gains over the course of the year. Perhaps unsurprisingly, \u2018bitcoin\u2019 cruised to the top spot on the list, beating out terms such as AI, Trumpcare, FAANG and even millennials,\u201d said Blockchain Life.\n\nIf new investors flow into the bitcoin market over the next few weeks, more traders would look into cheaper alternatives with lower market caps, as they have the potential to provide higher returns, but with more risks.\n\n\u201cFor new investors in crypto, think in market cap. Not price per coin. Market cap gives an estimate of the potential growth. Price per coin doesn\u2019t mean anything as the supply for each altcoin differs. $0.1 per coin doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s cheap. $100 per coin doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s expensive,\u201d explained cryptocurrency trader Squeeze.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock."

        "content": "The majority of power used in Bitcoin mining comes from renewable energy sources, according to research by ESG analyst and investor Daniel Batten.\n\nClimate activists and politicians have long criticized the impact of mining on the environment but recent research shows that Bitcoin is ushering in renewable energy at an unprecedented rate.\n\nBatten projects a 6.2% annual growth in sustainability in terms of power used for Bitcoin mining which will correlate with a decline in the usage of fossil fuel-based energy.\n\nWater\n\nAlmost a quarter of all Bitcoin miners use water to power their setups. Hydropower makes up 23.12% of all energy used in mining.\n\nAdditionally, the wind is used to generate power for 13.98% of Bitcoin mining, while nuclear and solar account for 7.94% and 4.98% of all power used in mining, respectively. Other renewable energy sources are used in about 2.40% of Bitcoin mining.\n\nAll in all, roughly 52.4% of all Bitcoin mining relies on renewable energy for its power needs and the trend is expected to continue growing in the coming years as traditional energy sources become more and more expensive.\n\nFossil fuels\n\nMeanwhile, roughly 43% of all energy used in Bitcoin mining is still generated via gas and coal. However, Batten noted that the electric vehicle industry still uses global gridmix, which generates 60% of its energy from fossil fuels.\n\nIn comparison, 43% is \u201calready exceptional,\u201d according to Batten.\n\nThe methodology used to calculate the percentages was shared in the research report and does not encompass 100% of Bitcoin mining setups in the world."

BTC has shown strength since day one of 2023 and has netted investors approximately 70% in returns. This article will break down key support levels and hurdles for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nRead more: Top 3 Price Prediction Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple: Altcoins flourish as BTC remains rangebound\n\nBitcoin price and historical returns\n\nBefore jumping into Bitcoin price, let us take a look at the historical quarterly returns for BTC. The quarterly return for the pioneer crypto is hovering around 68%, which makes it the 2nd biggest performance since 2021.\n\nGeneral observation shows that if the quarter one (Q1) returns are negligible, Bitcoin price shows enthusiasm and rallies in the next quarter. However, a greater than 20% return in Q1 is generally followed by a retracement or pullback in the next quarter.\n\nTherefore, investors need to be cautious of a potential correction.\n\nWhen looking at data that extends back to 2014, readers can observe that although the average return of BTC in Q1 2023 is 5.91%, quarter two has an average return of 32%. Clearly, there is a change in the narrative this year owing to the worsening macroeconomic conditions and multiple bank runs.\n\nIf ex-Coinbase CTO\u2019s prediction about hyperbitcoinization comes to life, then Bitcoin price could spike higher.\n\nBTC quarterly returns\n\nKey BTC levels on the monthly\n\nBitcoin price on the monthly timeframe shows that it has produced a higher high relative to August\u2019s swing high at $25,205. This shift in market structure suggests that the ongoing uptrend is likely to continue, albeit after a minor retracement.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the 50-line, attempting to move higher. If the bullish momentum continues, allowing RSI to flip the midpoint, it could signal a continuation of the run-up.\n\nFurther supporting this optimistic outlook is the Awesome Oscillator (AO), which shows a steady decline in the bearish momentum as two consecutive months close with a spec of bullish momentum.\n\nA flip of the RSI above the 50-line, if accompanied by AO moving above the zero line, would be a buy signal. The last time this similar structure formed was in 2019, after which Bitcoin price rallied 233% from $4,124 to $13,764 to setup a local top.\n\nSo if history repeats, the key levels to the upside include\n\nThe accumulation level is roughly $24,700.

Instead, the correction slices below the down candlestick formed between the two higher highs.\n\nThis down candlestick is known as a bearish breaker, a decisive close below it at roughly $20,200 will trap the bulls and is likely to trigger a tremendous spike in selling pressure on the next retest from below.\n\nAs seen in the chart below, a bearish breaker was formed in August. A retest of this breaker after a breakdown below it triggered an unusual spike in selling pressure.\n\nComing back to the current outlook, BTC is still 25% away from retesting the upper limit of the bearish breaker. As mentioned above, only a decisive flip of the $20,200 level will confirm the existence of a bearish breaker.\n\nA failure to close below the aforementioned level will indicate that the buyers are in control and could serve as a bouncing pad for the next leg-up.\n\nBTC/USD 3-day chart\n\nBTC bears in luck on lower timeframe\n\nThe four-hour chart for Bitcoin price also confirms a bearish breaker formation. A retest of the breaker has triggered a rejection that could plummet BTC down to collect the sell-side liquidity at $26,547.\n\nIn some cases, the downtrend could exacerbate and tag $24,736, the key support level shown on the monthly chart.\n\nBTC/USD 4-hour chart\n\nTo reiterate, Bitcoin price shows a bullish outlook on the monthly and weekly timeframes, but there will be an opportunity for bears to profit off of a small-time pullback to key high timeframe (HTF) levels.\n\nInvalidation of the long-term bullish outlook will occur if Bitcoin price slides below the $20,200 level and decisively flips it into a resistance level. Such a move could trigger the HTF bearish breaker to come alive. In such a case, investors should pay attention to the $17,605 support level, which is where the sellers climaxed after a 44% crash in June 2022.\n\nA breakdown of this level could send BTC spiraling down to collect the liquidity resting below the $15,588 equal lows. In an extremely bearish case, Bitcoin price could tag the $10,809 support level. This move would denote an 84% drawdown from BTC\u2019s all-time high of $68,958 and would potentially signal a bottom for the ongoing bear market."

        "title": "Bitcoin Hits $29,000 But Traders Prepare For More Volatility On Friday, Here\u2019s Why - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Bitcoin price saw an eye-catching move today, initially rising 2.8% ($810) in 30 minutes to reach a new yearly high at $29,182, only to fall to $28,080 in a very short period of time. At press time, Bitcoin showed renewed strength and was trading at $28,586.\n\nAnalyst Skew has several explanations for the puzzling movement of the BTC price. Aggregate CVDs & Delta show that there was a quick push into spot selling liquidity that was filled. In addition, the market showed a high premium under perps, meaning that perps led the price and the spot market began to sell.\n\n\u201cReaction is quick rally & sell off as crowded perp longs get caught on the downside volatility,\u201d explained the analyst, who also has another explanation in store. Looking at Bitcoin\u2019s Perp CVD Buckets & Delta Orders, the analyst noted increased whale movements that likely led to the move.\n\nWe\u2019re in whale town today it seems, the push up was cleanly orchestrated by whales & sold by whales. The odd one out here are the high leverage traders trying to short to zero & long to 100k lol. $BTC Binance Market CVDs & Delta: 15 min trend still intact bullish till we lose that trend.\n\nHe shared the chart below and added that it was forced selling and sell orders that drove the price down to meet limit buy orders. \u201cSomeone wants to get filled with size here. Pretty predatory & risky because other parties will notice this setup and hunt.\u201d\n\nMore Volatility To Come For Bitcoin On Friday\n\nFor several reasons at once, tomorrow could see even higher volatility. The first reason are the Bitcoin options, which have enjoyed rising popularity over the past few weeks.\n\nTomorrow is the quarterly settlement day, and the quarterly contracts are currently trading very actively, with short-term implied volatility continuing to rise, up nearly 10% in one day for the monthly maturity, according to Greeks Live.\n\nA total of 141,000 BTC options are about to expire, with a put-call ratio of 0.73, a maximum pain point of $24,000 and a notional value of $3.8 billion, the largest options exchange for Bitcoin, Deribit, shared via Twitter.\n\nLarge #options expiry coming this Friday 8 AM UTC \ud83d\ude80 141K #Bitcoin options are set to expire on Deribit with a notional value of $3.8 billion. \ud83d\udd25 Max pain $24,000, put/call ratio: 0.73#Ethereum max pain $1600, $3 B. notional value, put/call ratio 0.33 \ud83d\udd25#Cryptooptions #ETH pic.twitter.com/JTWSaamY5p \u2014 Deribit (@DeribitExchange) March 28, 2023\n\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index by the Bureau of Economic Analysis at 8:30 am EST will be the most important event of the week. The PCE is the Fed\u2019s preferred metric to gauge inflation and is therefore of great importance.\n\nCore PCE is forecasted to rise +0.6% month-over-month and +4.7% on an annualized basis. February PCE came in at +0.6%, but above the market forecast of 0.4%. The year-to-year reading was 4.7% in February (4.6% was expected). As a result, financial markets corrected southward.\n\nA similar scenario is conceivable tomorrow if the core PCE turns out worse than expected. However, if the core inflation rate increased less than analysts expect, the Bitcoin price is likely to receive confirmation for its upward trend.\n\nLast but not least, the monthly candle close is also coming up tomorrow, Friday. With a close at the current price levels, Bitcoin would confirm a clear breakout from the macro trend. Analysts at Rekt Capital shared the chart below and wrote:\n\nHistory has repeated itself. BTC has broken the macro downtrend. This time, around 385 days before the Halving. This Saturday, the BTC Monthly Candle will have closed above the macro downtrend to confirm a new bull market.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin has seen some good gains in the last day which eventually saw the digital asset climb over $29,000 for the first time in nine months, albeit briefly. But despite the price gains that the digital asset has seen in this time, it is still not the best performer in the crypto market as some altcoins continue to put up impressive rallies.\n\nARB, CFX, And 1INCH Make A Splash\n\nAs the week draws to a close, there have been some interesting movements from both Bitcoin and altcoins in the market. However, some altcoins continue to rise above and have been mostly in the green, especially in the last two days.\n\nThe digital assets that have been able to maintain their gains during this time include Conflux (CFX), Arbitrum (ARB), and 1inch Network (1INCH). At a time when altcoins are struggling to keep up with Bitcoin\u2019s gains, these assets continue to outperform.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, each of these digital assets has risen over 9%, sparking major interest in them. CFX which has been on a bullish momentum for the last week saw another 11.79% gain in the one-day period, bringing its price per coin to an impressive $0.4241.\n\nNext is 1INCH which has managed to claw its way out of obscurity and back into the spotlight. The token rose 10.16% in 24 hours to be trading at $0.5595. Its trading volume has also seen a major boost during this time as it rose over 231% to $80.9 million.\n\nAltcoins see higher gains than BTC | Source: Coinmarketcap\n\nFollowing behind is ARB with 9.38% gains. Now, ARB is interesting in that the coin was airdropped to users of the Arbitrum Layer 2 blockchain, and massive dumping followed shortly after, as expected. But after hitting a local low of $1.11 on Tuesday, the cryptocurrency has been on an uptrend since then. It is now trading at a price of $1.36, making it the third-highest gainer behind 1INCH.\n\nBitcoin Not Giving Up To Altcoins\n\nEven though these altcoins continue to outperform Bitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency is not giving up easily. It has been able to maintain the $28,000 territory despite mounting pressure from bears. It is also holding consistent gains on the weekly chart, which is not the same for most altcoins.\n\nBTC still trading above $28,600 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recovery is also moving the market, determining if investors remain bullish or not. Right now, as long as BTC continues to return gains and stay above its 50-day moving average, it remains on a path to re-enter a complete bull market.\n\nBitcoin is seeing gains of 0.72% in the last 24 hours to be trading at a price of $28,682 after briefly hitting $29,140, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Its trading volume is up 13% on the day and is now sitting above $22 billion.\n\nFollow Best Owie on Twitter for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet\u2026 Featured image from Binance, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin saw a higher net outflow despite large exchange outflows.\n\nSupport retest yielded some sell pressure, but long-term holders were still going strong.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] peaked at $29,380 on 24 March before experiencing a resurgence of sell pressure. Fast forward almost one week later, and the bulls are showing their strength once again.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nBitcoin crossed back above the $29,000 price point within the last 24 hours, raising bullish hopes that it will soon cross the $30,000 mark. But how likely is this outcome before the end of the week, especially now that the price has to contend with resistance?\n\nRecent market observations may offer some insights into what to expect. For example, on 30 March, Glassnode revealed that Bitcoin\u2019s Percent Supply Last Active 1+ Years was at a new ATH.\n\nThe Glassnode observation suggested that the amount of HODLed Bitcoin was still growing. However, there was also a surge in sell pressure over the last few days. Bitcoin\u2019s daily on-chain exchange outflow peaked at $1.1 billion while inflows were lower at $921 million. The cryptocurrency has thus been experiencing more sell pressure.\n\nWill Bitcoin bulls yield to prevailing sell pressure?\n\nA look at Bitcoin\u2019s press time position explained why it had been experiencing sell pressure. The upside, especially within the last 24 hours at press time, pushed back into the ascending resistance line. As such, many investors have been taking profits, thus triggering the pullback to the $28753 press time price.\n\nBitcoin was likely to experience sell pressure with the resistance line retest. Enough sell pressure may trigger more downside, while a bullish dominance may push past resistance and possibly above $30,000.\n\nA look at exchange data revealed that both inflows and outflows were down notably in the last 24 hours. However, exchange outflows slightly dominated at 22,178 BTC, compared to exchange inflows at 20,548 at the time of writing.\n\nHow many are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nInvestors should also note that Bitcoin open interest in the derivatives market is back to its two-month highs, an indication that there was strong demand for BTC in the derivatives market. This surge was accompanied by an uptick in the demand for leverage, as indicated by the estimated leverage ratio.\n\nThe last time that both metrics peaked at the same level was on 19 March. This was followed by a bit of sell pressure, but it was not enough to trigger a large pullback. The fact that the same metrics are back at the same level confirmed relative strength, but the bears may not be far behind."

        "content": "The crypto market traded sideways last week amid a crackdown on the largest crypto exchange Binance. Earlier this week, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Binance for trading against customers, misusing internal trading channels and making unregulated derivative markets.\n\nThis was followed by Bitcoin, the largest crypto token by market cap, touching its highest level of $29,000 since last June. But soon, it fell from the highs. On Friday, it was trading at $27,923, down 0.45 per cent since last week.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest digital token, was up 0.33 per cent to $1,794 last week.\n\n\"Surprisingly, last week, it was not the securities regulator SEC but the commodities regulator CFTC, that launched a slew of accusations against Binance. Binance is planning to fight against these claims in court,\" said Parth Chaturvedi, crypto ecosystem lead at crypto exchange CoinSwitch.\n\n\"Today, BTC is consolidating above the crucial $28,000 level, likely due to the US GDP report. A bullish trend line is in place offering support around $27,900,\" said Alankar Saxena, CTO and co-founder at crypto firm Mudrex.\n\nThe recently released US GDP data noted a slowdown in growth rate from 3.2 per cent in the previous quarter to 2.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022-23 (FY23).\n\nWhat to expect in the coming days?\n\n\"While Bitcoin and Ethereum showed a move to the upside at the end of the week, a lot of ongoing challenges are yet to be fixed for the industry before a sustainable move is seen,\" said Anurag Dixit, founder of crypto firm Kunji.\n\nAccording to Saxena, Bitcoin is currently facing resistance at the $28,500-$28,850 zone, and its primary uptrend support remains strong. However, it lacks the momentum for a \"significant move\".\n\nA major event to watch out for in the coming days is the significant drop in liquidity and trading volumes, particularly on Binance.\n\n\"Such conditions can be accompanied by high volatility in prices on either side, as large orders can sway prices rapidly. The regulatory fallout too continues to keep markets on shaky grounds,\" said Chaturvedi."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Flashes Above $29K As Binance FUD Continues - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) briefly flashed above the $29,000 mark on Thursday, hitting new highs for 2023. This comes amid increased crackdowns by US regulatory agencies on crypto exchanges and other businesses in the space, resulting in fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) amongst investors.\n\nAccording to data from TradingView and CoinMarketCap, the Bitcoin price reached $29,191 on Binance, revisiting levels last seen in November last year, just before the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX crypto exchange.\n\nBitcoin Trades In The Green Despite Recent Regulatory Crackdowns\n\nThe increase in the price of the flagship cryptocurrency comes in the wake of regulatory crackdowns on crypto firms. On March 27, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged Binance, its CEO Changpeng Zhao and its former CCO Samuel Lim of violating trading and derivatives laws.\n\nFollowing the news, the big crypto tanked by 6.5% losing the support provided by the $28,000 psychological level. Binance\u2019s inhouse token, Binance Coin (BNB), dropped as much as 8% from $330 to lows of around $300 on the same day.\n\nThe regulatory crackdown claimed its new victim on March 29 as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced charges against the crypto asset trading platform Beaxy and its executives. The regulator claims that Beaxy failed to register as a national securities exchange, broker and clearing agency. The SEC also charges the Beaxy founder for raising $8 million with an unregistered asset BXY and misappropriation of at least $900K for personal use.\n\nThis marks the second major lawsuit on a crypto company this month and the fourth in the span of two months, including the charges the SEC announced against the now-apprehended Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon\n\nThe fact that BTC\u2019s price has grown amid such bearish developments has surprised many market commentators. This is because some believe the Binance lawsuit will only result in minor fines for the largest crypto exchange by transaction volume.\n\nNote that the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, which numerically tracks current \u201cemotions and sentiments\u201d in the crypto market,has been increasing steadily over the last month, despite the turmoil in the global banking sector.\n\nAccording to data from Alternative, this index has gone back to the \u201cGreed\u201d zone, suggesting that investors are buying more.\n\nCrypto Fear and Greed Index\n\nSome analysts attribute the recent bullish trend displayed by Bitcoin to buying by large-volume traders, which was more related to their buying strategies than fundamentals.\n\nBitcoin Bulls May Exploit A Bullish Flag To $40,000\n\nBTC price action has created a bullish flag on the daily chart (below). This is a highly bullish pattern that signals the continuation of an uptrend. It was formed when Bitcoin bounced off the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $19,718, and rose sharply (46%), before correcting to areas below $27,500.\n\nThe correction is usually believed to be an opportunity for buyers to take a breather while allowing late investors to get in on the minor dip, before the uptrend continues. It is usually confirmed when a close is achieved above the flag. The target is set by measuring the percentage increase represented by the flag\u2019s post and adding it to the point of break out above the flag.\n\nThe chart below shows that Bitcoin escaped from the flag on March 29 paving the way for a massive move upward. As such, BTC\u2019s price may grow from the current levels, with the first barrier arising from today\u2019s intraday high of $29,191. Clearing this hurdle would clear the path for the pioneer cryptocurrency to move toward the technical target of the prevailing chart pattern at $40,113. Such a move would represent a 40% uptick from the current price.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nSupporting Bitcoin\u2019s bullish outlook was the up-facing moving averages and the position of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the positive region. The price strength at 66 suggested that the bulls were in control of the BTC price.\n\nIn addition, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator was moving above the zero line in the positive region. Note that this trend-following indicator abandoned a sell signal on March 29, suggesting that the recent uptrend was strong. The position of the MACD in the positive region shows that the market still favors the upside.\n\nConversely, things could go awry for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization if the price turns down from the current levels to produce a daily candlestick close below $28,000. Such a move would trigger sell orders that could see Bitcoin retreat to $27,500 or $25,000.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Chinnapong / Getty Images\n\nCrypto is an investment that is widely known for its volatility, with dramatic fluctuations that can work in an investor\u2019s favor or against it. Both scenarios have played out so far in 2023 and many are wondering what might be next, so here is a look.\n\nWill Crypto Recover in 2023?\n\nSeveral factors play a role in whether or not crypto will recover this year, including but not limited to:\n\nHow the banking industry fares, given recent closures.\n\nWhether or not the government continues to back assets held at closed banks, especially collapsed banks that held crypto investments.\n\nHow investor sentiment shifts as economic developments and policy efforts continue.\n\nWill Crypto Come Back Up Again?\n\nCurrent speculation hints at a potentially uncertain year ahead for crypto, despite a relatively robust start to 2023. Analysts will be watching the price of bitcoin, and many feel that its ability or lack thereof to hold a value of $25,000 will be a telltale sign for the cryptocurrency. The actions of the Federal Reserve will also play a critical role in investor confidence.\n\nThese are the factors at play, but the question remains: Is the crypto market ever going to recover?\n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to predict the trajectory of cryptocurrency because, like all investments, there is never a guarantee of performance or return. What is known is that historically this type of investment has yielded plenty of gains and losses over time, and that dual reality is likely to continue.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nWhat Makes Crypto Different from Other Investments\n\nUnlike stocks, ETFs or even U.S. savings bonds, crypto is a highly speculative investment with a long history of dramatic ups and downs. Certainly, crypto has experienced crashes before.\n\nNASDAQ reported that the last crypto winter occurred from January 2018 to early 2021. The crypto market has served as both a safe haven and a source of unpredictability for investors, but it is beginning to behave more like traditional asset classes.\n\nAlthough crypto is growing in popularity, with an increasing number of companies accepting it as a form of payment, no one knows if today\u2019s coins will be around decades from now.\n\nAn Investment You Can Easily Buy Low\n\nThe longstanding investment advice to buy low and sell high is quite possible with cryptocurrency, given its sometimes erratic nature. As long as you\u2019re not a risk-averse investor, it\u2019s not too late to buy the dip in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. To increase your odds of investment success, watch a coin\u2019s overall performance and fees, know your storage and security options, pick a reputable exchange and stick to coins with a known reputation and a high market cap.\n\nDawn Allcot and Chris Ozarowski contributed to the reporting for this article.\n\nInformation is accurate as of March 30, 2023."

        "title": "Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow: can S2F predict BTC price? - Young Platform",
        "content": "The Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model (S2F) is a method for calculating the scarcity of gold that can also be useful in predicting BTC price. Let\u2019s go find out what it is and how it works, looking at the S2F\u2019s past accuracy and its estimates for thefuture.\n\nWhat is the Stock-to-Flow model and how does it work?\n\nFinancial market players have several tools at their disposal to try to anticipate price movements. In particular, there is a model that tries to predict the price of Bitcoin: the Stock-to-Flow (S2F or S/F), let\u2019s see what it is and how it works.\n\nFirst of all, however, we must point out that, using the graphs of technical analysis and the macroeconomic factors of fundamental analysis, you can only make assumptions, never certain forecasts. Before making any transactions, you need to do your own research (DYOR) Also, do not forget to always take into account the risks involved in buying and owning cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Stock-to-Flow model values the scarcity of goods, a quality that should influence their value, given the law of supply and demand: if demand exists and is constant, the price of an object theoretically increases the rarer it is. This relationship is evident in those goods that are difficult to produce, considering the costs as well as the time and energy involved. Think of gold and other rare metals, raw materials with a limited and almost constant supply over time, since in the short term it is not easy to increase the quantity extracted, net of technological innovation.\n\nThe Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model, given this basis, calculates the ratio between the Stock, i.e. the total availability of an object, and the Flow, i.e. the new annual production. The number obtained corresponds to the years it would take to double the current supply, at the current rate of creation. In practice, how long it would take to reproduce the already existing quantity of a certain good.\n\nLet\u2019s quote some figures to better understand what the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model is: the World Gold Council\u2018s latest estimate (February 2023) suggests that a total of 208,874 tonnes of gold have been mined throughout history. Statista.com contributes by stating that 3100 tonnes were obtained in 2022, a number that usually varies between 2500 and 3300. The resulting S/F ratio, therefore, is about 67 years (208,874/3100): a measure of scarcity that, worked out in other formulae, can give an estimate of the future price.\n\nCan the Stock-to-Flow model predict BTC price?\n\nPlan B, a famous Twitter user, then redefined what the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model is, applying his logic to Bitcoin in order to try and predict its price. In his article Modeling Bitcoin Value with Scarcity, he quotes Satoshi Nakamoto himself, who presents his cryptocurrency as the first scarce digital asset:\n\n\u201cAs a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: boring grey in colour, not a good conductor of electricity, not particularly strong, [\u2026] not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose and one special, magical property: can be transported over a communications channel\u201d\n\nThe scarcity of this \u2018Internet metal\u2019 is ensured by the mining mechanism, through which it is \u2018mined\u2018 as if it were gold. In fact, Bitcoin is often called digital gold: new coins are minted as a reward for each block created by miners. Specifically, one is added to the Bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes and this rate is maintained by an algorithm, which increases or decreases the difficulty of the calculations to be performed. This process has an \u2018unforgeable costliness\u2019: it is impossible to produce BTC without using a lot of energy or ignoring precise rules.\n\nFirst, the maximum availability of Bitcoin is set at 21 million units, distributed according to the Halving programme. In practice, every 4 years (210,000 blocks) this mechanism halves the reward for miners, so that the production of new BTC is reduced by half. Therefore, the annual Flow gradually decreases and, when compared to the existing Stock, can give us an estimate of scarcity and value. Let us therefore look more specifically at how the Stock-to-Flow model works in the case of digital gold.\n\nCurrently, 900 new Bitcoins come into circulation every day, a total of 328,500 per year; total availability, however, is around 19,400,000, so the S2F model shows a shortage of 59 points. This ratio, however, is set to double as a result of the next halving in 2024, which will raise the premium per block from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, thus halving the annual Flow. Simply put, as more and more Bitcoins are in circulation, the annual production of new coins will be reduced to 164,250. At this \u2018halving\u2019 rate, it is estimated that the last BTC will be created in 2140, when it will reach maximum scarcity, given an almost infinite S/F ratio!\n\nPlan B, therefore, collected data on the price of Bitcoin throughout history and noted a statistically significant correlation with the Stock-to-Flow model. Specifically, it compared the trend of BTC to its S/F ratio, raised to power and multiplied by a constant to obtain a curve. This exponential function was optimised over time, changing various coefficients, but showed some correspondence to Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nFun Fact The Stock-to-Flow model tries to predict the value of Bitcoin through the formula price=exp(-1.84) * SF^3.36\n\nLooking at the graph, the price increases seem to occur as a result of Halving, although it is a simple correlation and not a definite cause. In any case, these events have a direct effect on the S/F ratio and the Stock-to-Flow model, in fact, was able to follow Bitcoin\u2019s price more or less correctly during the bull run of 2020/21, which led it to an all-time high of $69,000. However, from March 2022 onwards, the S2F model\u2019s estimates lost consistency with Bitcoin\u2019s actual trend, raising several doubts.\n\nCriticism of the Stock-to-Flow model: flaws and deviations\n\nThe price of Bitcoin observed a drastic drop in the bear market of 2022, which was not justified by the Stock-to-Flow model. In contrast, the version proposed by PlanB projected a value of $100,000 by the end of the year. Criticism was not long in coming and Vitalik Buterin even called the false sense of certainty given by the S2F \u2018harmful\u2019.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that when talking about the Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow, we have always called it a model, a hypothetical estimate, and it should be treated as such. In fact, S2F has some flaws: by nature, it only considers the weight of supply and ignores actual demand. In short, scarcity is not enough to stimulate the price, which does not increase if there is a lack of demand. Moreover, Bitcoin is an experimental technology, although it is more than 15 years old: its historicity is not comparable to that of gold, which has been established as a safe haven asset for hundreds of years.\n\nFinally, although Bitcoin scarcity is not regulated by price but by automated algorithms, these cannot counter unpredictable events (Black Swan) that can lead to high volatility. Examples of these are the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem or the failure of the FTX exchange, cases impossible to anticipate, which had consequences for the price of Bitcoin. In short, the reality suggested by the Stock-to-Flow model is static and partial, because it is limited to \u2018programmed\u2019 factors, such as Halving and Bitcoin\u2019s maximum availability, failing to consider macroeconomic aspects.\n\nThe inconsistency of the model, however, did not surprise Plan B, which proposed two alternative scenarios: either BTC is extremely undervalued, or the Stock-to-Flow model, as it works, will be less useful for forecasting in the future. In any case, it does not consider its analysis to be a complete failure because, by considering two standard deviations from the S2F curve, it is possible to obtain fluctuation bands, which still seem to justify Bitcoin\u2019s price."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2023 momentum as part of attempting to exit last year\u2019s crypto winter has resulted in the digital asset outperforming other investment products, despite a gloomy economic outlook.\n\nIn particular, Bitcoin has emerged as the top-performing asset class in Q1 2023, with gains of about 70%, making it the digital currency\u2019s best quarter since Q1 2021, according to Bloomberg data on March 31,\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that during the first quarter of 2021, Bitcoin gained about 103% at the onset of the last bull run. The asset\u2019s latest quarterly returns have placed the digital currency ahead of big names such as the S&P 500 (5.5%), Nasdaq 100 (19%), and iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (2.2%).\n\nBitcoin performance against other asset classes. Source: Bloomberg\n\nElsewhere, Bitcoin has also dwarfed gold, with the precious metal recording gains of 9.5% in the first three months of 2023, while silver\u2019s returns stand at 0.3%, as per data obtained by Finbold on March 31.\n\nInvestors flocking to Bitcoin\n\nAmid the quarterly gains, investors appear to be flocking to Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), as witnessed by the open interest spiking almost 430% YoY as of March 31. Bitcoin\u2019s ability to lead the market in gains has also revived optimism, with almost 1,000 new coins entering the space in 2023 alone.\n\nMarket experts, however, believe that Bitcoin\u2019s performance should not come as a surprise, noting that the asset began building the foundation for a possible rally in late 2022.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not at all a surprise. <\u2026> All the signs were pointing to a strong price floor starting last November, and it was just a matter of time before either the liquidity narrative changed (which it did in early January) or longer-term investors saw a store-of-value opportunity (which seems to have also happened),\u201d said Noelle Acheson, author of cryptocurrency book the Crypto Is Macro Now.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s gains have also coincided with the renewed possibility of further interest rate hikes as the Federal Reserve moves to tame skyrocketing inflation. The cryptocurrency has also capitalized on the chaos in the banking sector as investors view the asset as an alternative to centralized monetary systems following the collapse of Silvergate Capital, Signature Bank, and Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nIn this line, Bitcoin\u2019s resilience can be attributed to its legitimate fundamental improvements and its unique role as a bearer asset in a time of skepticism about bank deposits and increased central bank bailouts.\n\nPart of the impact of the banking crisis was highlighted by a Finbold report on March 21 that indicated that five leading U.S. banks lost a cumulative market capitalization of $108.92 billion in 2023 alone, while Bitcoin added about $219.86 billion.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAfter days of rallying, Bitcoin faces resistance at the $30,000 position, trading at $27,928 with daily losses of about 2.5%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nBitcoin now controls a market cap of about $540 billion after an inflow of over $200 billion in 2023."
