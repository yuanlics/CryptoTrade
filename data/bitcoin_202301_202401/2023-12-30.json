        "title": "These are the boldest bitcoin predictions for 2024 \u2014 one calls for a 1,000% rally to $500,000 - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nFilip Radwanski | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin had a huge rally in 2023, with the digital currency up some 152% for the year. And a number of commentators CNBC spoke to \u2014 both inside and outside of the cryptocurrency industry \u2014 expect the rise to continue. After hitting a record high in 2021, bitcoin had a rough 2022, which was marked by the collapse of high-profile projects, liquidity issues and bankruptcies. That year, FTX, once one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, filed for bankruptcy. In 2023, its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of all seven criminal counts brought against him by federal prosecutors in the U.S. Also in 2023, Binance's Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stepped down as the company's CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice.\n\nNow that those two high-profile cases are out the way, many cryptocurrency executives see it as a chance to move forward and draw a line under the bad behavior of two of the industry's poster children. With fervor returning to the crypto markets, industry executives are calling the start of a new bull run, mainly predicated on two things \u2014 the bitcoin \"halving\" and the potential approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. The halving, which happens every four years, is an event written in bitcoin's code. The rewards so-called miners get for mining bitcoin is cut in half. This keeps a cap on supply of bitcoin, of which there will only ever be 21 million. In previous price cycles, halving preceded a rise in the price of bitcoin. Meanwhile, there is growing excitement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve the first ever bitcoin ETF, after years of opposition. This would mean investors can buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin, without having to go on to an exchange and hold the digital currency directly. The industry is hoping this will draw in a wider range of investors, and in particular, large institutional investors. With all of this excitement comes some quite bold predictions about bitcoin's price. Here's a selection of some of them.\n\nMark Mobius: $60,000\n\nIn 2022, Mark Mobius correctly forecast bitcoin would drop to $20,000 when it was trading above $28,000. He had a price call of $10,000 thereafter, which he stuck to in 2023. However, that did not materialize, as bitcoin rallied. For 2024, Mobius told CNBC that bitcoin could reach $60,000 by the end of the year. \"No rationale for that prediction,\" Mobius said, except that a bitcoin ETF looks likely and \"that has heightened interest\" in the cryptocurrency.\n\nBit Mining: $75,000\n\nYouwei Yang, chief economist of crypto mining firm Bit Mining, believes that bitcoin could reach a high of $75,000 by 2024. Yang attributes the anticipated price rise to a bitcoin ETF being approved, leading to higher institutional investment in bitcoin, as well as May 2024's bitcoin halving, which would result in the bitcoin supply being constrained. \"I anticipate the Bitcoin will be trading around $25K to $75K in 2024, and $45K to $130K in 2025,\" Yang said in an emailed note. \"While high prices are possible, not all investors will profit due to market volatility and the human tendencies of fear and greed.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin's price performance over the last year.\n\nYang said the ETF approval remains the biggest story for bitcoin in 2024 \u2014 though investors should hold a degree of caution on timing given the wounds left by collapses of major crypto firms like Luna and FTX, and as it is an election year when the topic of crypto is likely to become more of a political issue. \"Timing the market is hard, but a gradual approach \u2014 accumulating in bear markets and taking profits in bull markets \u2014 might be a more effective strategy for whom don't have early-on accumulations.\"\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said the landscape for digital assets is set for \"significant change\" in 2024, driven by the potential approval of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. \"This long-awaited development is poised to expand the investor base for cryptocurrencies and integrate them more closely with traditional financial markets,\" Butterfill told CNBC via email. \"Estimations suggest that a 20% investment increase from current assets under management (around US$3 billion) could potentially propel Bitcoin prices to US$80,000.\" Meanwhile, the scenario of central banks cutting interest rates could also \"play a decisive role\" in moving bitcoin higher, Butterfill added. The market will be also looking at factors beyond the halving \u2014 which he considers already priced into bitcoin \u2014 that could influence the price of the digital coin further. \"Thus, while the halving is a known event, other elements, particularly the potential for interest rate reductions, are likely to be significant in shaping Bitcoin's price in the future,\" Butterfill said.\n\nAntoni Trenchev, a noted bitcoin bull and co-founder of Nexo, a cryptocurrency exchange, believes bitcoin could hit $100,000 in 2024. In 2022, he called for bitcoin to hit $100,000, but that didn't happen. Instead, the price of bitcoin collapsed that year. He held off from any further price predictions. But in a note in December, Trenchev reinstated his $100,000 call for 2024, citing the halving and potential approval of multiple bitcoin ETFs. \"My expectation for 2024 is that the twin-turbo boost from the Bitcoin halving & spot ETF approval should propel Bitcoin to $100,000, with the prospect of further highs in 2025,\" Trenchev said in a note. \"The road to $100,000 will be lined with unexpected potholes and double-digit declines as Bitcoin.\" Trenchev added that the biggest gains will come from digital tokens and projects \"that aren't even on the radar yet.\"\n\nStandard Chartered: $100,000\n\nIn November, Standard Chartered doubled down on its $100,000 call for bitcoin made in April. The bank said this will be driven by the approval of numerous ETFs. The halving will also be supportive for bitcoin, the bank said.\n\nCarol Alexander: $100,000\n\nIn 2022, University of Sussex professor of finance Carol Alexander had a fairly successful run of calling bitcoin's future price. She predicted bitcoin would slip to $10,000 in 2022. That year, bitcoin fell as low as around $15,480, according to CoinDesk data. For 2023, Alexander said bitcoin would rally as high as $50,000. Bitcoin reached a yearly high of roughly $44,700 in early December. Alexander told CNBC that during the first quarter of 2024, bitcoin will trade within the $40,000 to $55,000 range, owing to \"professional traders creating volatility.\" The next stage will depend on when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settles charges against Coinbase and Binance, which could be required before approval of a bitcoin ETF, according to Alexander, echoing other commentators. The SEC sued both Coinbase and Binance in 2023.\n\nAlexander said settlement of those charges is likely in either the second or third quarter, after which ETFs will be approved and bitcoin's price will rise to $70,000, a new all-time high. The price after that depends on the abilities of the ETF providers, such as Blackrock and Fidelity, \"to equip their market makers not only to create the ETFs, but also to defend price manipulations\" on exchanges which create \"excessive volatility.\" \"Before end of 2024 price could exceed $100k, but only if Blackrock and Fidelity market maker algorithms have the ability to reduce volatility,\" Alexander concluded.\n\nMatrixport, which bills itself as a crypto financial services firm, released a note in November projecting that bitcoin would reach $63,140 by April 2024 and $125,000 by the end of next year. \"Based on our inflation model, the macro environment is expected to remain a robust tailwind for crypto. Another decline in inflation is anticipated, prompting the Federal Reserve to likely initiate interest rate cuts,\" Matrixport said in its report. \"Combined with geopolitical crosscurrents, this healthy dose of monetary support should push Bitcoin to new highs in 2024.\" Many commentators see easing monetary policy as supportive for bitcoin, which is viewed as a risky asset. Meanwhile, some see bitcoin as a sort of \"safe haven\" asset to pour money into in times of geopolitical strife, though many disagree with this theory.\n\nCoinFund: Up to $500,000"

        "title": "Bullish on Bitcoin? Might as Well Buy MicroStrategy Shares, Says Canaccord - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "It\u2019s probably been the holiday season all year long at the Michael Saylor household. The MicroStrategy (MSTR) founder & chairman is one of the world\u2019s biggest bitcoin bulls and must have enjoyed watching the asset outperform in 2023. To wit, the leading crypto is seeing out 2023 up by 155%.\n\nThe last 3 months have been particularly bountiful, with BTC gaining 56% over the period. Canaccord analyst Joseph Vafi has a clear idea about what\u2019s been driving the gains. \u201cAs we have stated multiple times,\u201d said the 5-star analyst, \u201cwe believe BTC spot continues to move higher in anticipation of US spot BTC ETF approvals in January.\u201d\n\nNever one to think there\u2019s such a thing as too much bitcoin, in the meantime, Saylor has been loading up. After purchasing ~16,130 bitcoins for $593 million during November (at an average price of $36,785 per bitcoin), last week MicroStrategy disclosed that it had bought another 14,620 bitcoins throughout December. At an average price of $42,110 each, that purchase set the company back another $616 million. As of December 26, MicroStrategy\u2019s BTC stack stood at 189,150, with an overall average acquisition price of ~$31,200 per bitcoin. At the time of writing, one bitcoin is worth $42,375.\n\nAs Vafi notes, investors looking to get in on the bitcoin game can just stay in the stock market and purchase MSTR stock. While bitcoin\u2019s direct returns have obviously been excellent, MSTR shares are up by a phenomenal 346% this year. Here, Vafi also has an explanation for the disparity between BTC\u2019s display and that of MSTR shares. \u201cPartially driving MSTR\u2019s relative outperformance versus BTC remains scarcity premium for equity investors looking for exposure to BTC,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhile there are other equity plays with exposure to BTC, they bring with them materially higher operating risk (COIN & the Bitcoin miners, for example). While MSTR has some operating risk in its business, we would quantify it as much less on a comparative basis as its BI software business is sticky, highly recurring, and cash flow rich.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, it\u2019s the bitcoin holdings that are the main story here. By now, Vafi estimates that MicroStrategy\u2019s software business represents less than 15% of the overall enterprise value, with the vast majority now down to the company HODLing (what refers to the buy-and-hold strategy) 189,150 bitcoins. \u201cIn comparison,\u201d Vafi notes, \u201cmost other equity plays with crypto exposure do so by virtue of their business operations; and few have a HODL of any material size.\u201d\n\nBottom-line, due to the ongoing price appreciation in BTC combined with \u201cfurther accretive additions to the HODL,\u201d Vafi thinks it\u2019s time for a new price target for MSTR shares. His objective moves from $670 to $791, making room for further gains of 25% from current levels. (To watch Vafi\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nOver the past 3 months, only 2 other analysts have waded in with MSTR reviews, but like Vafi, they are also bulls, providing the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average target stands at $713.67, implying share gains of 13% for the coming year.

        "title": "Bitcoin Outlook 2024: What are the emerging themes to watch out for? - The Economic Times",
        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the investment universe gets ready to bid adieu, all signs point to the popularity and acceptance of cryptocurrencies getting bigger and better in 2024. As we step into 2024, the landscape of the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, and Bitcoin, the pioneering digital currency, remains at the forefront. Bitcoin 's journey has been marked by both triumphs and challenges, and the year 2024 promises to bring about new trends and emerging themes that will shape the future of this decentralized digital asset. Before we get excited or curious about what 2024 is about to bring us, let us remember that studies and trends have showing an explosion of trends in cryptocurrency that investors can try to participate in. However, for the sake of this article, let us try to explore a handful of these themes that we can look forward to in the New Year.Despite the well-documented challenges faced by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in recent years, there has been a notable uptick of institutional interest in Bitcoin. All signs point to this intensifying in 2024, with more traditional financial institutions and corporations exploring ways to integrate Bitcoin into their portfolios. As regulatory clarity improves, it will only serve to strengthen Bitcoin's reputation as a store of value with institutions looking at using it increasingly as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.Another challenge that Bitcoin has been dealing with for a few decades is that of Scalability, leading to slow transaction processing times and higher fees during periods of high demand. In 2024, seeing the rise in fees, adoptability of layer 2 solutions such as the Lightning Network would see an increase. Lightning significantly enhances Bitcoin\u2019s transaction throughput. This would make microtransactions more feasible and contribute to a more efficient and scalable network.Consumption of energy by cryptocurrencies expended during mining of crypto has been a hot topic of debate and has been concerning environmentalists and environment-conscious folks for years. While there is no telling with absolute certainty if this problem is one that will be solved or not. However, in 2024, the industry is likely to witness increased efforts to address the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, data storage, etc. Innovations in sustainable mining practices, the use of renewable energy sources, and the development of eco-friendly consensus algorithms may emerge as key themes, aligning Bitcoin with broader environmental goals.The fast-growing technology that is soon if not already challenging the existing centralized monetary system, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has gained tremendous momentum in the cryptocurrency space. Come 2024, and it is expected that Bitcoin will expect to be more widely accepted to play a more active role in this ecosystem. Projects exploring the integration of Bitcoin with DeFi applications could open up new avenues for lending, borrowing, and trading, allowing users to leverage Bitcoin in a decentralized financial landscape. 2024 will also more than likely see the connection of more TradFi and DeFi bridges and gateways which will bring about a constant flurry of the development of innovative hybrid financial products. An increase in the number of connections will facilitate the seamless flow of capital between traditional / centralised finance and DeFi thereby legitimising the world of crypto in India.It is widely expected across the cryptocurrency world that India will announce and implement a proper set of regulatory guidelines for the protection and understanding of its 20 million investors in 2024. It is no secret that clearer regulatory frameworks may provide a sense of security for investors and businesses, fostering a more robust and stable ecosystem. The institution of these much-needed guidelines will go a long way in bringing about a great deal of clarity and regulation from various jurisdictions, which could positively impact the adoption and use of Bitcoin on a global scale.Privacy remains a fundamental concern in the cryptocurrency space, and in all likelihood 2024, will see an increased emphasis on privacy enhancements, such as the integration of technologies like CoinJoin and Confidential Transactions. These features could offer users greater privacy and fungibility, making Bitcoin transactions more confidential and resistant to surveillance.Often dubbed \"digital gold\" and a hedge against economic uncertainties, with as geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties likely to persist at least through H1 2024. Bitcoin may continue to attract investors seeking a store of value and a diversification strategy. While Bitcoin is primarily known for its role as a digital currency, developments in 2024 may pave the way for the integration of smart contracts on the Bitcoin network. This would bring additional functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing for more complex programmable transactions and potentially expanding its use cases.Over the course of the last few years, the process of altering real-world assets into digital tokens, is gaining some serious momentum. 2024 is expected to see tokenizing of traditional assets, such as financial assets, commodities, real estate, or even intellectual property, fractional ownership can be created, liquidity could be enhanced liquidity, while allowing for democratize access to these modern asset classes. 2023 saw a rise in Ordinals making use of the Taproot upgrade. Ordinals are basically NFTs on bitcoin. Ordinals emphasizes Premium art and we predict this market would see a substantial rise with many startups emerging in 2024. This is one of the factors of driving fees up. In the New Year, investors can expect further advancements in tokenization protocols and the emergence of tokenized assets enabling individuals the opportunity to invest in a wider range of assets using lesser amounts of capital. With greater tokenisation comes a more viable opportunity for institutional investors to diversify their investment portfolio.The Bitcoin industry is more than likely to see a significant increase in the number of ETFs especially after the filing of a Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock which will go a long way in opening up the participation Institutional investors in the Bitcoin world. A financial player as large and reputed as BlackRock entering the world of Bitcoin in 2023 bodes well for 2024 when it comes to the adoption of digital crypto assets. This action of BlackRock has shown that the future of Bitcoin is extremely bright with their more than likely integration into the financial world. 2024 could just prove to be the year of Crypto ETFs as other institutions are watching and waiting for regulatory approvals before they decide to follow suit and change the world of Bitcoin forever.Despite never-ending criticism from the naysayers, 2024 promises to be a pivotal year marked by the promise of a great deal of financial innovation in the world of cryptocurrency. Moving further into the digital age will see greater in the whole ecosystem of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies resulting in Bitcoin being poised to play an increasingly significant role in the global financial landscape. Keeping an eye on these emerging themes will be crucial for investors, enthusiasts, and industry participants as they navigate the dynamic and exciting world of cryptocurrency in 2024.(Roshan Aslam is Co-founder & CEO at GoSats)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "In the dynamic landscape of investment, the primary objective is to achieve returns that surpass the rate of inflation, all while considering the impact of taxes on the overall investment strategy. In the spotlight of the year 2023, Bitcoin has emerged as a standout performer, overshadowing traditional asset classes such as gold, equities, real estate, and bonds.\n\nIn stark contrast to the challenges faced in the previous calendar year, 2023 has proven favourable for cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. The world's most renowned cryptocurrency has staged a remarkable comeback, boasting a 154.37% surge in 2023 that contributed a substantial $530 billion to its market capitalisation.\n\nAlso Read: Five assets that could beat inflation in 2024\n\nThis is a noteworthy turnaround from 2022, when Bitcoin witnessed a significant 65% dip amid tightening monetary policy and a series of blowups that exposed high counterparty risk.\n\nBitcoin price has jumped $25,506 in 2023, reaching $42,208, according to CoinDesk prices. The highest level of this digital currency was hit in November 2021, when it topped $67,802.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Jumps 160% in 2023 amid roller coaster ride; What lies ahead for cryptocurrencies?\n\nAt the outset of 2023, the cryptocurrency sector faced a multitude of challenges, such as the FTX and TerraLuma debacle, regulatory scrutiny, legal actions against prominent exchanges, and the closure of doors by several nations due to concerns about relinquishing economic control to private currencies, which cast a cloud of negativity over the market.\n\nAmidst these hurdles, savvy investors, particularly large asset-backed institutional players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Valkyrie, and others, seized the opportunity.\n\nLet's look at the performance of other major asset classes in 2023:\n\nEquities: A record year\n\nThe Indian market saw a remarkable rally in 2023, with key benchmark indices -Nifty 50 and S&P BSE Sensex - gaining 20%. The surge can be attributed to robust participation from retail investors and sustained Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) inflows, propelling frontline indices to break multiple record highs.\n\nThe most significant phase of the market rally unfolded between November and December, following the BJP's victory in three crucial state elections. This outcome signalled the potential return of the NDA in the 2024 general elections.\n\nAlso Read: 2023 in Review: FPI inflows recorded at \u20b91.65 lakh crore, highest since 2020; will the trend continue?\n\nAdditionally, a pause in US Federal Reserve rate hikes, coupled with indications of a 75-basis-point rate cut in 2024, contributed to positive sentiment among investors. The upbeat mood was further bolstered by India's robust economic growth of 7.6% in the September quarter, solidifying its status as the fastest-growing economy in the world.\n\n2023's impressive rally propelled the market capitalisation of NSE-listed stocks to surpass the $4 trillion mark for the first time on December 01. As of December 29, the market capitalisation reached $4.3 trillion, bringing India's equity market closer to Hong Kong, which is currently valued at $4.7 trillion.\n\nAlso Read: Will the Indian market continue its strong run?

The Indian IPO market has also been a wealth creator, with many IPOs debuting at substantial premiums on the opening day, contributing to the overall vibrancy of the market.\n\nIn contrast to the stellar rally in Indian stocks, China delivered a negative return in 2023 due to real estate woes and the country's ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Another major peer, Hong Kong, also delivered a negative return in 2023.\n\nGold: Shone brightly\n\nGold, a traditional asset known for its resilience during economic and geopolitical uncertainty, gained sharply in 2023, marking a significant turnaround from two consecutive years of underperformance. The precious metal recorded a gain of 13.16% in 2023 to $2062 per ounce and reached a record high of $2135 on December 4th.\n\nMultiple catalysts fueled this remarkable ascent, including geopolitical tensions, central bank actions, fluctuations in the dollar index and US yields, and the recent Israel-Hamas war, which also boosted demand for the safe haven asset, and expectations for interest rate cuts have provided further support.\n\nAlso Read: Gold and silver outlook 2024: Motilal Oswal lists four key factors that may influence prices in 2024\n\n\u201cCentral banks purchased around 800 tonnes of gold over the first three quarters of 2023, 14% ahead of the same period last year, according to data from the WGC. Last year, global central banks purchased a record 1,136 tonnes of gold, compared to 450 tonnes bought in 2021, mostly driven by a flight towards safer assets amid soaring inflation. Last year was not only the thirteenth consecutive year of net purchases but also the highest level of annual demand on record back to 1950,\" said domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal in its latest report.\n\nReal Estate: A year of robust growth\n\nThe Indian residential real estate space witnessed a healthy demand in 2023 due to various factors, such as a pause in rate hikes, increased buyer interest, and rising rental costs. As various reports suggest, residential property values in the country's top six cities increased by 10-15% in 2023, representing the highest capital appreciation rates witnessed in a decade.\n\nAlso Read: Nifty Realty index soars 77% in 2023 so far amid residential sales boom; Prestige Estates, Brigade, DLF top gainers\n\nDespite the substantial increase in property prices and a surge in mortgage rates, the housing sector experienced a remarkable surge. According to recent data released by real estate consultant Anarock, housing sales in the top seven cities rose by 31% in 2023, reaching an all-time high of nearly 4.77 lakh units.\n\nThis, in comparison with the 2022 figure of 3,64,870 units, underscores the robust growth and sustained momentum in the Indian residential real estate sector.\n\nAnarock Chairman Anuj Puri said, \"2023 has been phenomenal for the Indian housing sector, despite global headwinds, rising domestic property prices, and interest rate hikes over the first half of 2023.\"\n\nPuri said it was widely expected that rising property prices and interest rates, along with global market uncertainties, would impact residential sales, but high demand sustained.\n\nDebt: Higher volatility\n\nBonds typically operate as one of the safest and least volatile assets globally, offering a stable income stream and acting as a hedge against the risks associated with stocks. However, bonds experienced significant volatility in 2023, driven by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, a pause in rate hikes, and open market operation (OMO) announcements by the RBI.\n\nAlso Read: As the bull run continues, it is time to exercise caution, say experts\n\nThe increase in yields had an impact on returns from debt instruments, with the price of bonds decreasing as yields rose. Nevertheless, the RBI's decision to pause rate hikes had positive implications for debt investments, as a decline in interest rates tends to enhance the value of debt securities. Debt funds managed to generate returns ranging between 6.5% and 7% in 2023.\n\nDisclaimer: We advise investors to check with certified experts before making any investment decisions.\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "content": "Amidst a monumental surge in 2023, Bitcoin BTC/USD has reached $44,000, notching a 150% climb in value in 2023. The rise has garnered the focus of Bitcoin maximalists and high-profile personalities, who, collectively dubbed the \u201cmillion dollar club,\u201d are forecasting a historic peak that could see Bitcoin reaching the $1 million milestone.\n\nMillion-Dollar Dreams for Bitcoin\n\nArk Invest CEO Cathie Wood in August, said that Bitcoin has the potential to surge into the six-figure range and possibly reach $1 million by 2030. In an exclusive interview with Benzinga, Wood reaffirmed her conviction that Bitcoin could achieve the $1 million mark within a timeframe of five to seven years.\n\nRobert Kiyosaki, the author behind \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad,\u201d has long championed the rise of Bitcoin. He predicted Bitcoin would reach $1 million in August. \"IF world economy crashes BC [Bitcoin] $1 million Gold $ 75K silver to $60k. SAVERS of FAKE US $ F'd. DEBT too high.\"\n\nAdding to the bullish forecasts, in March, Balaji Srinivasan, the former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Coinbase, placed a bet that Bitcoin\u2019s value will reach $1 million by June 17. He cited imminent hyperinflation of conventional currencies, which he believes will thrust the global economy into a state of \u201chyperbitcoinization,\u201d crowning Bitcoin the preferable global currency akin to \u201cdigital gold.\u201d However, he lost that bet.\n\nIn December, Samson Mow, the CEO of Jan3, said Bitcoin would likely reach $1 million in the \"days to weeks\" following the approval of a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF), reported Cointelegraph. \"You're hitting a very limited supply of Bitcoin on the exchanges and available for purchase with a torrent of money.\"\n\nSee More: Dogecoin HODLERs Are Beating Shiba Inu With 57% Landing In Profits, IntoTheBlock Data Reveals\n\nSaylor to Keiser: High Stakes Estimates\n\nSome other experts and CEOs had their own set of predictions for Bitcoin\u2019s future value.\n\nDuring a discussion with CNBC, Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy\u2019s CEO and Chairman, expressed confidence that Bitcoin could increase tenfold in value. He anticipates further adoption, spurred by significant macro and technical developments expected in 2024. Among these, Saylor said the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, saying, \u201cYou're going to see $12 billion of natural selling per year converted into $6 billion of natural selling a year\u2014at the same time as things like spot Bitcoin ETFs increase the demand for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCryptocurrency firm Matrixport projected a short-term climb, stating that Bitcoin\u2019s price could reach $45,000 within two months. This 30% hike from its present valuation is based on several in-house models that previously anticipated Bitcoin\u2019s October surge.\n\nOthers like Arthur Hayes, in an episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, estimated a Bitcoin price range between $750,000 and $1 million by 2026. On the other hand, Max Keiser took to X to claim that Bitcoin will rise to $220,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Gracy Chen, Bitget CEO expressed skepticism about the idea of Bitcoin reaching $1 million by 2030, as theorized by Cathie Wood, calling the prediction \u201ca bit crazy.\u201d Yet, Chen predicts a rise to $100,000 remains within possibility.\n\nPhoto by kitti Suwanekkasit on Shutterstock\n\nRead Next: Here\u2019s How Much You Should Invest In Shiba Inu Today For A $1M Payday If SHIB Hits 1 Cent?"

        "title": "Heroes to zeroes in 12 months: How the two biggest crypto billionaire CEOs proved the critics right - CNBC",
        "content": "Combination showing Former FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried (L) and Zhao Changpeng (R), founder and chief executive officer of Binance. Getty Images | Reuters\n\nAfter a brutal 18 months of bankruptcies, company failures and criminal trials, the crypto market is starting to claw back some of its former standing. Bitcoin is up more than 150% this year. Meanwhile, Solana is nearly 10x higher in the last 12 months, and bitcoin miner Marathon Digital has also skyrocketed. Crypto-pegged stocks like Coinbase , MicroStrategy and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust rose more than 300% in value year-to-date. But even as prices swell, the sector's reputation has struggled to regain ground after names virtually synonymous with bitcoin have both been found guilty of crimes directly related to their multibillion-dollar crypto empires. For years, Binance's Changpeng Zhao and FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried preached the power of decentralized, digital currencies to the masses. Both were bitcoin billionaires who ran their own global cryptocurrency exchanges and spent much of their professional career selling the public on a new, tech-powered world order; one where an alternative financial system comprised of borderless virtual coins would liberate the oppressed by eliminating middlemen like banks and the over-reach of the government. Yet they both, in the end, helped crypto critics and regulators make the case that some of them had been right all along; that the industry was rife with grifters and fraudsters intent on using new tech to carry out age-old crimes. Even when the crypto market was at its hottest, as token prices hit all-time highs in Oct. 2021, some of the biggest names in business and politics shared their doubts. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in 2021 at peak crypto valuations that bitcoin was \"worthless,\" and he doubled down on that sentiment earlier this year when he said that the digital currency was a \"hyped-up fraud.\" Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said in 2018 that he would short bitcoin if he could, adding that cryptocurrencies are \"kind of a pure 'greater fool theory' type of investment.\" Legendary investor Warren Buffett said he wouldn't buy all of the bitcoin in the world for $25, because \"it doesn't produce anything,\" and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has long been one of crypto's greatest naysayers on Capitol Hill.\n\nRather than ushering in a new era of financial freedom, Zhao and Bankman-Fried were found guilty on a mix of charges including fraud and money laundering. Once the two biggest names in crypto, the sector's greatest proponents now face jail time. Bankman-Fried, 31, could be sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of seven criminal counts in early November, including charges related to stealing billions of dollars from FTX's customers. Less than three weeks after Bankman-Fried's conviction, Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stepped down as Binance's CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice. Their crimes varied, but ultimately, both crypto execs went from industry titans to convicted frauds in the span of 12 months, and it was, in part, the bitter feud between them that landed them there. \"They were both responsible for behavior that has kept a black eye on crypto and its association with criminal behavior,\" said Renato Mariotti, a former prosecutor in the U.S. Justice Department's Securities and Commodities Fraud Section.\n\nThe early days\n\nZhao and Bankman-Fried were friends at first, before they became one another's chief rival. CZ, as Zhao is also known, had been first to the space. After a stint as the chief technology officer of a centralized crypto exchange called OKCoin, he launched a spot exchange of his own in 2017 called Binance, which has since become the largest cryptocurrency trading platform in the world, by volume. That same year, Bankman-Fried earned street cred in crypto circles for his bitcoin arbitrage trading strategy, dubbed the Kimchi swap. While the price of bitcoin today is relatively standard across the world's exchanges, six years ago, the price differential would sometimes vary by more than 50%. This kind of arbitrage-based strategy, though relatively straightforward, wasn't the easiest thing to execute on crypto rails back then, since it involved setting up connections to each one of the trading platforms. To scale the operation, Bankman-Fried launched his own quantitative crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research. But what really put him on the map, according to Bankman-Fried, was CZ himself. Just after Bankman-Fried moved his business to Hong Kong at the end of 2018, he met CZ for the first time after contributing $150,000 to co-sponsor a Binance conference in Singapore. One of the perks of that donation was a slot onstage with the Binance chief. According to author Michael Lewis, whose book profiling Bankman-Fried was published the day the former FTX CEO's criminal trial began in October, Bankman-Fried said this appearance is what gave him \"legitimacy in crypto.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nThe pair, according to Lewis's reporting, were nothing alike in business or in personal dealings. \"Sam was gunning to build an exchange for big institutional crypto traders; CZ was all about pitching to retail and the little guy,\" Lewis wrote, adding, \"Sam hated conflict and so was almost weirdly quick to forget grievances; CZ thrived on conflict and nurtured the emotions that led to it.\" The relationship between Zhao and Bankman-Fried began to sour a few months after they met. In March 2019, CZ passed on paying Bankman-Fried $40 million to buy the futures crypto exchange that SBF had designed with his team, instead building a version of the same platform in-house. A month later, Bankman-Fried and a few others founded FTX.com, a first-of-its-kind futures trading exchange with a flashy new liquidation engine and features which catered to large-scale institutional clients. Binance was the first outside investor in FTX, funding a Series A round in 2019. As part of that arrangement, Binance took on a long-term position in FTX's native token, FTT, which was created to give perks to customers. FTX's success begat a $2 billion venture fund that seeded other crypto firms. Bankman-Fried's personal wealth grew to around $26 billion at its peak, and FTX reached a valuation of $32 billion before it all came crashing down. As crypto prices ran up in 2021, Bankman-Fried's reputation did the same. Suddenly, the wunderkind was praised by the press as the poster boy for crypto everywhere. The FTX logo adorned everything from Formula One race cars to a Miami basketball arena. Bankman-Fried went on an endless press tour, bragged about having a balance sheet that could one day buy Goldman Sachs, and became a fixture in Washington, where he was one of the Democratic Party's top donors, promising to sink $1 billion into U.S. political races before later backtracking. Bankman-Fried wielded some of that political influence to cast shade on Zhao and Binance's dealing. At the same time, CZ's influence continued to grow, as did Binance's market dominance. With assets of more than $65 billion on the platform, it processed billions of dollars in trading volume every year. As the two grew to be formidable opponents, FTX opted to buy out Binance in 2021 with a combination of FTT and other coins, according to Zhao. But much of Bankman-Fried's empire was a mirage, while Zhao's operation was laced with questionable business tactics under the hood. What ultimately exposed the grift at the two exchanges was the rivalry between the crypto bosses.\n\nwatch now\n\nBattle of the titans rocks crypto\n\nAs crypto prices tanked in 2022 and a cascade of bankruptcies rocked confidence in the sector, Bankman-Fried boasted that he and his enterprise were immune. But in fact, the industry-wide wipeout hit his operation quite hard. Alameda borrowed money to invest in failing digital asset firms in the spring and summer of 2022 to keep the industry afloat, then reportedly siphoned off FTX customers' deposits to stave off margin calls and meet immediate debt obligations. In Nov. 2022, a fight between Bankman-Fried and CZ on Twitter, now known as X, pulled the mask off the scheme. Zhao dropped the hammer with a tweet saying that because of \"recent revelations that have came [sic] to light, we have decided to liquidate any remaining FTT on our books.\" The threat led to a panic-led sell-off of the FTT token. As the price of the coin plummeted by over 75%, so too did confidence in the platform. FTX executives scrambled to contain the damage, but customers proceeded to pull billions of dollars off the exchange. Zhao, who swooped in and agreed to buy FTX in a fire sale, backed out of the deal after one day's worth of due diligence, and the company spiraled into bankruptcy. As outsiders got a look at FTX's actual books for the first time, the fraud became clear: Bankman-Fried and other leaders at FTX had taken billions of dollars in customer money. In fact, during the criminal trial of Bankman-Fried, both the prosecution and defense agreed that $10 billion in customer money that was sitting in FTX's crypto exchange went missing, with some of it going toward payments for real estate, recalled loans, venture investments and political donations. They also agreed that Bankman-Fried was the one calling the shots. The key question for jurors was one of intent: Did Bankman-Fried knowingly commit fraud in directing those payouts with FTX customer cash, or did he simply make some mistakes along the way? Jurors decided within a few hours of deliberation that he had knowingly committed fraud on a mass scale. The government's beef with Zhao and Binance was different. Three criminal charges were brought against the exchange, including conducting an unlicensed money-transmitting business, violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and conspiracy. Binance has agreed to forfeit $2.5 billion to the government, as well as to pay a fine of $1.8 billion, for crimes which included allowing illicit actors to make more than 100,000 transactions that supported activities such as terrorism and illegal narcotics. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a press conference on Nov. 21 that the fine is \"one of the largest penalties we have ever obtained.\" \"Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor; it makes you a criminal,\" Garland said. The $4.3 billion settlement and plea arrangement with the U.S. government, including the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Treasury Department, resolves a multiyear investigation into the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The Securities and Exchange Commission, however, was notably absent. Zhao and others were also charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to implement an effective anti-money-laundering program and for willfully violating U.S. economic sanctions \"in a deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the U.S. market without implementing controls required by U.S. law,\" according to the Justice Department. The DOJ is recommending that the court impose a $50 million fine on Zhao. In the meantime, CZ has been released on a $175 million personal recognizance bond secured by $15 million in cash and has a sentencing hearing scheduled for Feb. 23. Bankman-Fried faces a sentencing hearing on March 28.\n\nIndicted FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried leaves the U.S. Courthouse in New York City, July 26, 2023. Amr Alfiky | Reuters\n\nWinning the war"

        "title": "Bitcoin halving and why it matters? - The Financial Express",
        "content": "By Edul Patel\n\nAt the forefront of discussions within the crypto community lies an event of paramount importance\u2014Bitcoin Halving. With the next Bitcoin Halving scheduled for the upcoming year, it stands as the focal point of current discourse, captivating the attention and curiosity of enthusiasts alike. This pivotal event is of significant importance to the Bitcoin network.\n\n\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Halving?\n\n\n\nBitcoin was introduced by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. It is a decentralized digital currency with a capped supply of 21 million coins. To regulate the issuance of new bitcoins and control inflation, Nakamoto incorporated a mechanism known as the \u201chalving\u201d into the protocol.\n\n\n\nApproximately every four years, or after every 210,000 blocks are mined, the reward for miners is halved. In the early days, miners received 50 bitcoins per block; after the first halving in 2012, this dropped to 25 and subsequently to 12.5 in 2016. The most recent halving occurred in May 2020, reducing the reward to 6.25 bitcoins per block. This predetermined reduction in supply is hard-coded into the Bitcoin protocol, ensuring a gradual and predictable issuance until the maximum supply is reached.\n\n\n\nWhy Bitcoin Halving Matters?\n\n\n\nScarcity Implications:\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value proposition is the concept of scarcity, mirroring precious metals like gold. The halving mechanism plays a pivotal role in accentuating this scarcity. As the supply of new bitcoins dwindles, the existing stock becomes more valuable, creating a deflationary economic model.\n\n\n\nIn traditional fiat currencies, central banks have the authority to print money at will, leading to inflation. With its capped supply and halving events, Bitcoin offers a hedge against inflation, making it an attractive asset for investors seeking a store of value.\n\n\n\nMarket Dynamics and Price Volatility:\n\n\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is often accompanied by heightened market speculation and price volatility. Historical data reveals that leading up to and following a halving event, the cryptocurrency experiences significant price movements. The scarcity factor often results in surges in demand and subsequent price rallies.\n\n\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that the relationship between halving events and price is complex and influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and investor sentiment. While past halvings have been associated with bull markets, they are not foolproof indicators of future price movements, but there is just a likelihood.\n\n\n\nMining Economics\n\n\n\nMining, the process by which new bitcoins are created, and transactions are added to the blockchain, is an integral component of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The halving has direct implications for the economics of mining. Miners must rely more on transaction fees to sustain their operations as the block reward diminishes.\n\n\n\nThis dynamic can lead to increased competition among miners, potentially consolidating mining power in regions with low electricity costs. Additionally, it underscores the importance of transaction fees in securing the network, aligning miners\u2019 interests with the long-term health of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n\n\nGlobal Impact\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving events attract global attention, serving as a focal point for discussions on the future of money and the role of cryptocurrencies in the broader financial landscape, contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s growing legitimacy as a viable asset class.\n\n\n\nThe significance of the halving extends beyond the crypto community, permeating into traditional finance, policy-making, and economic discourse. Governments and central banks are compelled to reckon with the rise of decentralization, prompting discussions on regulatory frameworks and digital asset integration.\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\nWhile the Bitcoin halving injects a sense of excitement and anticipation into the crypto space, it is not without its challenges. Scaling issues, environmental concerns related to energy consumption in mining, and regulatory uncertainties pose ongoing hurdles. The evolving landscape demands collaboration between the crypto industry and regulators to foster responsible innovation and ensure the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nIn the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, the Bitcoin halving is a testament to the protocol\u2019s resilience and the foresight of its creator. Beyond the technical intricacies, it symbolizes the pursuit of an alternative financial system\u2014one built on principles of scarcity, decentralization, and economic sovereignty. It symbolizes a departure from traditional monetary systems, offering an alternative vision where individuals can transact and store value with greater autonomy. As the crypto community eagerly anticipates each halving event, it reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is not merely a technological innovation but a transformative force poised to reshape the future of finance.\n\nThe author is co-founder and CEO, Mudrex\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"
