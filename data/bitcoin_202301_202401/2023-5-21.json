        "title": "Free Pizzas! Crypto platforms bring in Bitcoin Pizza Day with offers and goodies - BusinessLine",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency platforms are bringing in Bitcoin Pizza Day by distributing free pizzas, gift vouchers, and other goodies. Indian players Coinswitch, Mudrex, and Zebpay are running campaigns to promote and celebrate the day when Bitcoin was used for the first time to buy a real-world commodity.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is celebrated widely by the crypto community worldwide on May 22 every year. The symbolism of the event is to mark how open-source internet money, which wasn\u2019t of significant worth then, went on to be the highest-valued crypto token in the world and saw wide adoption.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange CoinSwitch is giving away pizzas to crypto users who share their experiences of entering the world of cryptocurrencies. CEO Ashish Singhal wrote in a tweet, \u201cShare your first experience of investing in crypto, and I\u2019ll gift a pizza for the most unique story. Let\u2019s celebrate together with pizza.\u201d He also noted that his introduction to crypto was in 2014, when he started dabbling with Bitcoin nodes and codes.\n\nAlso read Bitcoin on course for longest streak of monthly gains since 2021\n\nSimilarly, exchange Zebpay has a Bitcoin Pizza Day offer on the platform. Crypto users who trade on the platform today can win gift vouchers worth \u20b91,000. \u201cTrade from \u20b91,000 to \u20b91 lakh or more and stand a chance to win prizes including cash vouchers, air tickets, and much more,\u201d the platform said on Twitter.\n\nMudrex, a crypto investing platform, is also running a Bitcoin Pizza Day campaign and has distributed pizzas to approximately 300 start-ups and companies in and around Bengaluru. It has also partnered with Via Milano in Bangalore, granting new signees the opportunity to indulge in complimentary pizzas provided by Via Milano.\n\nIts CEO and co-founder, Edul Patel, said, \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day symbolizes the incredible journey of cryptocurrencies, from a humble transaction to a global phenomenon. It reminds us of the immense growth potential and transformative power of digital assets in shaping the future of finance.\u201d\n\nGlobal crypto player Binance is tying up with members of the community to make their own pizza, complete with their own \u2018BTC\u2019 toppings logo. Participants would be winning the crypto equivalent of a year\u2019s supply of pizza.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Pizza Day\n\nThe day is celebrated to mark the first time Bitcoin was used for a real-life transaction. On May 22, 2010, two pizzas were bought for 10,000 bitcoins, at a time when Bitcoin was known and understood by very few people.\n\nLaszlo Hanyecz, a programmer in Florida who was a part of the initial phases of Bitcoin, decided he had to put his mined tokens to use. He then put out a message on the Bitcoin Talk Forum saying, \u201cI\u2019ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas, like maybe two large ones, so I have some leftover for the next day.\u201d\n\nA few days later, on May 22, a man on the forum named Jeremy Sturdivant took up the offer and got Hanyecz and two pizzas delivered from Papa John\u2019s. A single Bitcoin today is worth $26,830.5 and was even worth $69,044 at its all-time high in 2021.\n\nAlso read: WazirX partners with Taxnodes to simplify tax computation for VDAs"

        "content": "In this article, we will examine the 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites. If you want to skip the detailed analysis, visit 5 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites.\n\nIn today's technologically advanced world, people have come beyond physical assets and currencies in dealing with transactions. That's where cryptocurrency comes in, giving users a convenient way to buy and sell products and services through e-money. However, it's important to be vigilant and conduct due diligence before selecting a cryptocurrency investment platform or site in terms of its reputation, authenticity, current status, and credibility. This article will give useful insight to Bitcoin investors about 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites.\n\nMarket Outlook\n\nCryptocurrencies remained popular in 2021, especially Bitcoin (BTC). Goldman Sachs started dealing with transactions in cryptocurrencies. In April 2021, Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) was among the first crypto exchange platform to go public at a valuation of approx. $100 billion. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shook hands with Coinbase in October 2022 to create feasibility for its cloud computing clients to deal transactions in e-money. Moreover, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also began accepting BTC as payments from users since 2014.\n\nThe most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, had a successful year, according to CNBC. Since 2021, the worth of the e-currency has risen by about 70%, driving the total market worth of crypto above $2 trillion. However, 2022 happened to be unfavorable for most cryptocurrency holders. Throughout 2022, Bitcoin lost 65% of its market share. A series of bad events, comprising the collapse of FTX (one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges), the crash of Terra Luna, and the predicted unfavorable macroeconomic situations, took crypto devotees by surprise.\n\nThe Big Crash\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve began to boost interest rates to combat excessive inflation, the price of cryptocurrencies fell much like almost everything else in the financial sector. That surprised many of Bitcoin's most ardent supporters, many of whom thought the digital money would act like gold does: as a hedge against inflation. In contrast to their predictions, the price of Bitcoin was dropping at the time of rapid inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe main cause of the crypto market's slump was the failure of FTX. In addition to causing a significant market sell-off, FTX's bankruptcy and dispute with Binance have decreased liquidity in the cryptocurrency market. Individual investors, particularly those who purchased digital assets close to the highs, have suffered. However, structural issues in the sector have been highlighted, according to Lee Reiners (an expert in cryptocurrency law and policy):\n\n\u201cIt really exposed a number of crypto firms who were, you know, overextended, had poor risk management, or otherwise were engaging in fraudulent activity.\u201d\n\nIs the Forecast Optimistic or Pessimistic?\n\nFor the majority of cryptocurrencies, 2023 has begun on a clean and favorable note. Some investors have turned to Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies for safety as inflation has slowed down, the recession is becoming more imminent, and the U.S. financial crisis is still raging.\n\nAccording to Analytics Insight, some market analysts believe Bitcoin will reach a price of $100,000 by the end of 2023. Others claim that Bitcoin won't rise over $70,000.\n\nBitcoin traded in a constrained price range from $26,000 to $28,600 from halfway through March to mid-April. On April 10, Bitcoin saw a breakout to the upside, reaching a high of $31,005 on the back of favorable inflation statistics that suggested the Fed may decide to hold off on interest rate rises in favor of rate cuts sooner than previously anticipated. Bitcoin has increased by 80% this year compared to last. Although Bitcoin is still approximately 50% below its all-time high, which was over $69,000 in November 2021, the path to recovery is still lengthy.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin will experience a halving event in 2024 is another factor supporting analysts' positive outlook on the cryptocurrency. Every four years, there is a Bitcoin halving event in which the currency's miner payouts are cut in half. Given that halving serves to reduce supply, this occurrence is widely seen as being favorable for Bitcoin's price. In the past, halving has been viewed as a highly positive indicator for boosting Bitcoin's price.\n\n12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our list of 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites, the main factor on which we based our list is the 'score\u2019 from 0.0 to 10.0 extracted from Coinmarketcap as of the writing of this article. The score reflects average liquidity and investors' confidence, among other factors, on the crypto exchange platforms. We have also mentioned the platforms' trading volume (keeping in mind that trading volume fluctuates at any given time).\n\nSo, without further delay, let's head toward 12 Trusted Bitcoin investment sites.\n\n12. Huobi\n\nScore: 6.5\n\nTrading Volume: $298,644,218\n\nHuobi is one of the most trusted platforms for bitcoin trade, but the platform alos has its own coin. The native cryptocurrency of Huobi Global exchange is called Huobi Token (HT). Huobi users received Huobi Token in 2018 as part of a unique giveaway program that gave tokens out for free to platform users.\n\n11. Gemini\n\nScore: 6.6\n\nTrading Volume: $8,048,955\n\nAlthough Gemini supports fewer cryptocurrencies (including BTC), it places a strong emphasis on the security and compliance of the funds that its consumers invest with it. Despite having fewer assets, this platform is still a great choice for both new and seasoned traders due to its strong security emphasis and selection of tools and products.\n\nGemini has become the first SOC 2-certified cryptocurrency exchange in the market, demonstrating its dedication to security. The SOC 2 evaluation gauges a company's or product's levels of compliance and safety and is conducted by outside auditors.\n\n10. Gate.io\n\nScore: 6.6\n\nTrading Volume: $322,173,059\n\nAn investor can trade BTC on Gate.io for a maximum trading cost of 0.2%. Customers can decrease this charge in a number of ways, including by using the utility token of Gate.io. While not the cheapest on the market, this cost is also not the most expensive either.\n\n9. LBank\n\nScore: 6.6\n\nTrading Volume: $573,256,808\n\nLBank offers a web-based trading platform that is unique in many ways. The site also includes a number of sophisticated tools and features, including the technical analysis indicators RSI, KDJ, MACD, and CCI. The exchange platform also includes a volume window below the order windows and a market depth window below the chart. All of the attributes are displayed in an intuitive way.\n\n8. Bitfinex\n\nScore: 7.0\n\nTrading Volume: $28,683,171\n\nBitfinex, which was established in 2012, has comparatively cheap trading costs, with the majority of trade deals costing just 0.20% or less. Their trading interface is easy to use, and seasoned traders will value the capabilities and possibilities it provides. To test one\u2019s approach before investing real capital, an individual may start with a free paper trading account that provides them access to the Bitfinex platform and handles their money with convenience (this is akin to a stock market game).\n\n7. Bybit\n\nScore: 7.0\n\nTrading Volume: $217,986,015\n\nInvestors on Bybit can leverage their funds 100 times for Bitcoin and 50 times for other currencies. Additionally, users can also avail the option of purchasing temporary loss insurance. Both the site and the mobile app have attractive features for its loyal investors. Bybit provides traders with the Market Maker Incentive Program, which gives a maker fee reimbursement of up to 0.015%.\n\n6. Bitstamp\n\nScore: 7.1\n\nTrading Volume: $32,635,496\n\nDue to the presence of a small selection of currencies, Bitstamp is perhaps better suited for freshies and casual traders. Bitstamp Tradeview, Bitstamp.net, and Bitstamp Mobile are the three platforms that traders may utilize to trade. On all platforms, trading fees are the same. For users with less than $10,000 in trading activity over the last 30 days, the maximum trading cost on Bitstamp is merely 0.50%. Investors who trade larger sums each month would see a significant reduction in fees, which is on par with, or cheaper than what other well-known crypto exchanges charge.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Trusted Bitcoin Investment Sites.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Trusted Bitcoin Investment Sites is originally published on Insider Monkey."

        "title": "Bitcoin convention draws smaller number of faithful - Marketplace",
        "content": "Bitcoin believers gathered in Miami for what organizers say is the world\u2019s biggest annual bitcoin convention, though it was quite a bit smaller than last year. It drew less than half of the 35,000 attendees who went in 2022.\n\nOf course, a lot has happened in the crypto world since then. A little disaster called FTX, a crypto-friendly bank failure or two. Not to mention the price of bitcoin has taken a dive, from around $40,000 during last year\u2019s event to about $26,000 this time around.\n\nMarketplace\u2019s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with senior reporter Matt Levin, who was there to take the pulse. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nMatt Levin: It is mostly like any other convention, which was somewhat surprising to me. It\u2019s a lot of crypto companies debuting products, demoing products, there\u2019s an exhibit hall. There\u2019s a lot of noncrypto companies here: real estate companies, HR software companies, recruiting companies that are just trying to get bitcoin clientele. But there are some kind of bitcoin-specific eccentricities, I would say, that you probably wouldn\u2019t see at other conferences.\n\nMeghan McCarty Carino: Like what?\n\nLevin: Some of the odder things I\u2019ve seen: there\u2019s a mechanical bull in the middle of the exhibit hall that you can ride, literally riding the bitcoin bull. You can buy a children\u2019s board game that\u2019s supposed to introduce your kids to the concept of bitcoin. You can buy s\u2014 coin wipes \u2014 I\u2019m using \u201cs\u201d to replace an expletive there. Bitcoiners aren\u2019t big fans of other cryptocurrencies like dogecoin, etherium. So you can buy s\u2014 coin butt wipes \u2014 someone was trying to sell that to me.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s mechanical bull. (Courtesy Matt Levin) The s\u2014 coin toilet flushing down other cryptocurrencies. (Courtesy Matt Levin)\n\nMcCarty Carino: Does it seem like people\u2019s faith has been shaken at all in crypto, given the turmoil over the last year or so \u2014 the so-called crypto winter?\n\nLevin: So there\u2019s a bit of sample bias here, obviously. If you\u2019re still coming to Bitcoin 2023, you\u2019re probably still a believer in bitcoin. So the short answer is no, their faith is not shaken. They\u2019re in it for the long haul. And you hear a lot of them talk about, \u201cwell, hey, look, inflation is a significant problem in the U.S. now.\u201d You know, the U.S. is in danger of defaulting on its debt. These are all kind of credos of bitcoin maximalism. So they kind of feel like they have a little bit of a tailwind right now.\n\nMcCarty Carino: So you\u2019ve been at the convention a couple days now. What\u2019s kind of caught your eye?\n\nLevin: So one thing I didn\u2019t expect that probably should have: The global presence here is actually pretty impressive. I met a lot of people from Latin America, people from Hong Kong, people from Eastern Europe. And then, the other thing, honestly, is being a reporter with public radio. I didn\u2019t know how popular I would be at this particular convention. But people, for the most part, have generally been just as willing to talk as any other convention.\n\nMore insight from Meghan McCarty Carino\n\nMatt Levin mentioned he was surprised by the big international presence at the conference. Given the decentralized and anonymized nature of cryptocurrency, it\u2019s a little hard to get exact breakdowns for where people are using it most. One index by Chainalysis found grassroots crypto adoption by individuals (not big institutions) was highest in Vietnam, the Philippines, Ukraine and India, followed by the United States.\n\nIn the U.S., Marketplace\u2019s Kimberly Adams has done some reporting on the disproportionate share of Black Americans investing in crypto, which was framed, at least during better times in the crypto market, as a way to build generational wealth in a country where racial disparities in wealth have barely budged since the 1960s \u2014 and which has a history of discriminatory practices in traditional banking."

        "title": "Texas A&M Team Studying Effects Of Crypto Mining On The Texas Power Grid - Texas A&M University Today",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency transactions may be costing more than just transaction fees. The electricity used for these transactions is more than what some countries, like Argentina and Australia, use in an entire year.\n\nPublished estimates of the total global electricity usage for cryptocurrency assets such as Bitcoin are between 120 and 240 billion kilowatt-hours per year, according to the White House Office of Science and Technology. The United States leads these numbers.\n\nFinance and business experts have debated the ramifications of cryptocurrency and mining, but little focus has been placed on the impact of these activities on the power grid and energy consumption until now.\n\nDr. Le Xie, professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University and associate director of the Texas A&M Energy Institute, is at the center of this effort to understand how cryptocurrency mining impacts the power grid and how to use this information for further research, education and policymaking.\n\nEven as technology improves, allowing users to do more while using less energy, cryptocurrency mining is computationally intensive, and the measure of power on the blockchain network, or hash rate, is still rising.\n\nDuring the summer heatwave of 2022 in Texas, Xie and his collaborators found an 18% reduction in worldwide cryptocurrency mining. The decrease was linked to the stress on the Texas power grid, which led the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to issue a request for energy consumers to conserve energy.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a very strong negative correlation between the mining demand and the systemwide total net demand,\u201d Xie said. \u201cWhen the grid is stressed, crypto miners are shutting down, which demonstrates a potential for demand flexibility.\u201d\n\nFor example, when the grid is under stress due to a heat wave, homeowners consume more air conditioning and, in turn, more power. Compared to these types of firm demand, the cryptocurrency mining demand shows good potential for providing flexibilities during times when peak energy usage in other areas is vital.\n\nTheir findings are published in the March issue of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Transactions on Energy Markets, Policy and Regulation and the June issue of Advances in Applied Energy.\n\nIn these papers, Xie and his students provide data to allow a first step into studying these mining facilities\u2019 carbon footprint and the impact on grid reliability and wholesale electricity prices. Ultimately, location matters, and many factors play a part in this complex discussion.\n\n\u201cIncreasing firm demand will invariably result in a decrease in grid reliability,\u201d Xie said. \u201cHowever, with crypto mining modeled as a flexible load that can be turned off during the stressed moments, it can be a positive contributor to the grid reliability.\u201d\n\nXie is the lead for the Blockchain and Energy Research Consortium at Texas A&M, which is a collaboration between a team of Texas A&M researchers and industry partners. Their mission is to provide an unbiased multidisciplinary resource to communicate recent developments in the intersection of blockchain and energy.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrency is still in its infancy, one thing is certain \u2014 increasing energy usage will be critical as this emerging industry for transactions continues to advance. With that in mind, Xie is continuing his research to find a solution that helps take advantage of blockchain-enabled technologies while ensuring a sustainable grid operation."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMicroStrategy's Michael Saylor says bitcoin's current rally is in fact the start of a new bull run.\n\nThe software company's cofounder chalks up the new bull market to bitcoin's halving, more adoption of the crypto asset, and a regulatory crackdown on the industry that should benefit bitcoin.\n\nInvestor and developer interest will begin shifting from other blockchains, Saylor says, and into Bitcoin's network as regulation begins to weed out competitors like Ethereum. Earlier this year, US Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler said that \"everything other than bitcoin\" falls under securities laws.\n\n\"I think the crypto tokens and crypto securities are going to be regulated, perhaps out of existence,\" he told CNBC on Friday, adding that the token is the one commodity that the SEC is not going to regulate. \"Bitcoin is the most secure network. It's the most secure asset. Everything else has got a black cloud hanging over it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \"You're going to see a consistent flow of capital flowing from the rest of the crypto ecosystem [into] bitcoin.\"\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board's also recently proposed guidance on crypto accounting and reporting, Saylor says, which is a significant milestone as well. It provides companies that hold crypto on their balance sheets, like MicroStrategy, further clarity and transparency for their shareholders, which could lead to further mainstream adoption.\n\n\"The FASB initiative to adopt fair value accounting is a very auspicious development,\" he said.\n\nThis, along with Bitcoin's halving and a migration of Ordinals inscriptions activity on its network, are bullish as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrdinals is a protocol that expands the blockchain's use case and recently helped drive a new record for daily Bitcoin transactions as well. Bitcoin's halving, a technical event that occurs roughly every four years, is tentatively slated for April 2024. This could pump the price of the crypto by enhancing bitcoin's scarcity because the halving can reduce the number of new bitcoins released.\n\nAlthough the space is going through \"growing pains,\" Saylor says there are still plenty of bullish factors for bitcoin.\n\n\"Nearly all of the bad leverage has been squeezed out. Everyone in the business of shorting bitcoin, rehypothecating bitcoin, loaning bitcoin \u2014 they've all [gone] bankrupt. The remaining exchanges where you can short it are under a massive amount of regulatory pressure,\" Saylor told the outlet.\n\nHe added: \"I think bitcoin's found the bottom. I think the leverage is out of it. I think we're on a bull run.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been the subject of intense speculation and volatility in recent times. In the midst of these dynamics, bullish Bitcoin price predictions prevail. In fact, some of them reach the $1 million mark. One of the reasons for that is the much-anticipated halving event. Other key catalysts include the recent collapse of U.S. banks, inflation, and amplified demand for alternative financial systems. That being said, market analysts have become far more optimistic on the future of Bitcoin, including:\n\nBitcoin Price Predictions 2024 : Dan Tapiero\n\nBitcoin coin with bull and stock chart. Bullish market of BTC-USD. Cryptos to buy.\n\nSource: Maxx-Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThree market analysts have emerged with bold predictions, anticipating Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by 2024. For example, crypto analyst Dan Tapiero says BTC could pass $100,000 during the latter half of 2024 or 2025. Tapiero shared his forecast during an interview with Scott Melker. In fact, according to Tapiero, Bitcoin may trade sideways for the duration of 2023. Shortly after, he expects to see $100,000 around the halving event. Among other contributing factors named by Tapiero was the adoption of blockchain technologies by states and companies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBitcoin Price Predictions : Standard Chartered Bank\n\nVarious cryptocurrency coins. Cryptos. Cryptocurrencies representing 3AC Crypto., ARBK Stock. cheap cryptos to buy on the rebound\n\nSource: Wit Olszewski / Shutterstock\n\nGeoff Kendrick, the head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, also believes Bitcoin could test $100,000 next year. This optimistic outlook is based on several factors, including the turmoil in the banking sector, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, and the expected conclusion of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hikes. Kendrick also highlights the nearing end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s tightening cycle as a favorable factor for Bitcoin\u2019s future performance. The correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq suggests that if there is a broader improvement in risk-on assets, Bitcoin is expected to trade more favorably.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving event in 2024 is considered a powerful catalyst that could contribute to future price increases. Additionally, regulatory changes aimed at facilitating investor access to the market, such as the introduction of digital asset ETFs and stablecoin regulations, could boost Bitcoin even more.\n\nPrediction 2024 : PlanB\n\nCrypto coins on a phone screen showing stats for various cryptocurrencies.. best cryptos\n\nSource: Chinnapong / Shutterstock\n\nAccording to the pseudonymous analyst PlanB, known for his Stock-to-Flow (S2F) BTC price prediction model, Bitcoin will pass $100,000. PlanB also believes this will happen shortly after the next halving event. The model evaluation of Bitcoin\u2019s price is based on parameters such as scarcity and the relationship between BTC\u2019s existing supply and its production rate. PlanB states that the coin reached a cyclical low of $15,000 in Nov. during the FTX collapse. He suggests that in case Bitcoin reaches $32,000 shortly, the next possible price target of $100,000 can be reached soon after the 2024 halving event.\n\nJulia Magas is a writer who covers the latest trends in finance and technology.

        "content": "May 22 is a day that holds a special place in the hearts of cryptocurrency enthusiasts around the world. It's a day of celebration, known as Bitcoin Pizza Day, marking a pivotal moment in the history of Bitcoin. On this day in 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer and early Bitcoin miner, made a transaction that would go down in history as the first documented use of Bitcoin to purchase physical goods. May 22: Bitcoin Pizza Day! In 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz made history by using Bitcoin to buy pizza\u2014a milestone for cryptocurrency enthusiasts worldwide. (Twitter)\n\nHanyecz, a resident of Florida, took to the Bitcointalk.org forum on May 18, 2010, with an unusual request. He announced his desire to buy two large pizzas using Bitcoin and offered a whopping 10,000 BTC to anyone who would fulfill his pizza order. At the time, the value of Bitcoin was less than half a cent per coin, making the offer seemingly extravagant.\n\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\n\nDays went by, and it seemed that Hanyecz's quest for Bitcoin-powered pizzas would go unfulfilled. However, on May 22, a fellow forum user named Jeremy Sturdivant, who went by the username \"jercos,\" stepped up to the challenge. Sturdivant agreed to order and deliver the pizzas to Hanyecz in exchange for 10,000 BTC. The pizzas were from Papa John's, and while they were not enjoyed directly from the restaurant, their significance would far surpass a simple meal.\n\nLittle did Hanyecz know that the 10,000 BTC he spent on those pizzas would skyrocket in value over the following years. If he had held onto them until Bitcoin's all-time high price of $68,990, he could have potentially amassed a mind-boggling fortune of around $690 million. Just imagine the number of pizzas he could have bought with that!\n\nReflecting on the historic transaction, Hanyecz shared in a 2019 interview with CBS that he believed it made Bitcoin \"real for some people.\" It was a tangible use case for digital currency and showcased its potential as a medium of exchange. For Hanyecz himself, it was a significant moment that solidified his belief in Bitcoin's revolutionary power.\n\nAlso Read | Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy becomes the second 2024 presidential candidate to accept Bitcoin donations\n\nSince that fateful day, the global crypto community has come together annually on May 22 to commemorate Bitcoin Pizza Day. It serves as a reminder of the humble beginnings of Bitcoin and the incredible journey it has undertaken. It's a time to celebrate the progress made in the world of cryptocurrencies and to reflect on how far we've come.\n\nSo, on this Bitcoin Pizza Day, let's raise our slices and toast to Laszlo Hanyecz, the pioneer who took a leap of faith with his digital currency and forever changed the course of history. And perhaps, let's also reflect on the value of patience and the importance of holding onto our Bitcoin... or pizzas, for that matter."

        "content": "An eruption of memecoins and nonfungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain has reshaped the revenue profile of miners and stirred questions about how lasting the upheaval will prove to be.\n\nNew software known as Ordinals paved the way for the NFTs and meme tokens to come to the network this year. Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. says the Bitcoin NFT ecosystem could be worth $4.5 billion by 2025, while about 25,000 memecoins have been tallied on the blockchain since they first emerged in March.\n\nThe NFT and meme-token craze spurred record transactions and an ensuing fee windfall for miners, who run the computers underpinning Bitcoin. At one point in May, transaction fees made up over 40% of revenues, whereas miner income is usually dominated by the new Bitcoin they get for securing the blockchain.\n\n\u201cThe Ordinals protocol has stimulated a seismic shift in the Bitcoin mining landscape,\u201d said Jihan Wu, chairman of Singapore-based Bitdeer Technologies Group, one of the top crypto miners by computer power.\n\nOrdinals and a crypto rebound have eased the pressure on mining margins caused by last year\u2019s digital-asset rout and high energy costs. But Bitcoin purists argue the Ordinals phenomenon clogs the network and interferes with the largest cryptocurrency\u2019s store-of-value and payments functions.\n\nThe mean fee per transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain began April at $2.80, reached $30 on May 8 and moderated to $6 on May 18, CryptoQuant data show. Total fee income attributable to Ordinals stands at about $37.4 million, according to data compiled by Dune Analytics AS.\n\nDeveloper Casey Rodarmor created Ordinals, a software protocol that lets users inscribe digital content like videos, images and text on satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. There are 100 million satoshis in one Bitcoin.\n\nRodarmor\u2019s innovation then allowed a pseudonymous blockchain analyst called Domo to develop the Bitcoin Request for Comment \u2014 or BRC-20 \u2014 standard, which led to the explosion of memecoins.\n\nThe durability of the sudden ardor for NFTs, or digital collectibles, and speculative tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain remains an open question. The market value of the memecoins was heading toward $1 billion earlier in May but has since declined to about $582 million, figures from BRC-20.io show.\n\nThe BRC-20 tokens have no utility, said Carlos Gonzalez Campo, a research analyst at crypto exchange-traded product provider 21Shares AG.\n\nThe fundamental takeaway may be that Ordinals has created a pathway to uses of the Bitcoin network that didn\u2019t exist before.\n\n\u201cWhile the memecoin frenzy on Bitcoin will likely subside eventually, valuable use cases will emerge from the chaos, such as utilizing Bitcoin as a data availability layer and storing crucial documents that require permanent preservation,\u201d said Sami Kassab, a research analyst at Messari.\n\nShares Rally\n\nA sustained boost to transaction income could help sustain the Bitcoin network longer term by keeping miners engaged. Transactions will be the sole revenue source by about 2140, when Bitcoin is due to hit its cap of 21 million tokens and new coins will no longer be issued in return for securing the blockchain.\n\nFor now, Ordinals is helping to fuel renewed investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin miners. The 20-member MVIS Global Digital Assets Mining Index is up 110% so far in 2023, outstripping Bitcoin\u2019s 74% advance.\n\nThe application of ordinals is \u201ccompletely rewriting how people think about mining profitability,\u201d said Colin Harper, head of content and research at crypto-mining services provider Luxor Technologies."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has stabilized near $27,000 since May 13, displaying reduced volatility in the period. This movement is eerily similar to early April, when Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 12-hour chart ranged between $27,800 and $28,700 for 11 days. Traders are now questioning whether a bullish breakout is the next possible outcome for the Bitcoin price.\n\nBitcoin/USD price index, 12-hour. Source: TradingView\n\nAccording to technical analysis, the sideways movement illustrates an ongoing conflict, meaning traders are unsure about the direction of Bitcoin\u2019s next price trend. This is a consequence of balanced demand between buyers and sellers, which typically precedes periods of extreme price volatility and is triggered by big events.\n\nIn other words, Bitcoin traders are waiting for a potential market trigger that could decisively push the BTC price in either direction. For instance, on May 25, the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis will announce the annualized gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter. This data will be followed by U.S. durable goods orders on May 26, which measures the cost of orders received by manufacturers.\n\nA separate debate concerns the U.S. debt ceiling fight, with talks remaining deadlocked last week. Bipartisan negotiations are underway to lift the debt limit to avoid a U.S. government default ahead of June 1, but no agreement is in sight. In short, Republicans are demanding several cuts in government spending as contingencies.\n\nAnalyzing whether the Bitcoin derivatives market structure resembles the early April period is the first step to understanding the odds of breaking above $29,000 if the macroeconomic environment allows.\n\nBitcoin futures markets display reduced demand from bulls\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks, but these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, BTC futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThere\u2019s little similarity between the early April bullish breakout and the current status of the Bitcoin futures premium. Even though the 4% level seen on April 10 was below the neutral 5% threshold, it represented an increase from two weeks prior.\n\nIn contrast, the indicator presently stands at 2%, in line with the previous two weeks, so traders are currently less optimistic in comparison to early April.\n\nBitcoin options pricing is perfectly balanced between bulls and bears\n\nTraders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become more optimistic. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign of when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nIn essence, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs displayed above, according to the BTC options 25% delta skew, traders flirted with excessive optimism on March 30 but reverted to a neutral stance by April 10. That is the perfect positioning for a surprise rally, as traders were gradually losing faith, according to options pricing.\n\nOn the other hand, the most recent range trading period initiated on May 13 displayed balanced pricing between the call and put options, perfectly reflecting how unsure traders are due to uncertain macroeconomic conditions.\n\nThe derivatives market differs from early April\n\nBitcoin options and futures markets indicate little to no resemblance to early April, when the BTC price ended its 11-day low-volatility period. That time around, Bitcoin rallied 8% from $28,300 to $30,800 in less than 24 hours.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a similar outcome is impossible if Bitcoin\u2019s present 10-day sideways movement near $27,000 ends up breaking to the upside. Still, a bullish breakout is less likely, considering BTC options traders are pricing similar risks for upside and downside movements.\n\nMoreover, the overall sentiment according to Bitcoin futures is neutral to bearish, which is unchanged when compared to the past couple of weeks.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Its aggregated liabilities were worth about US$1 billion to US$10 billion to more than 100,000 creditors.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January charged cryptocurrency lender Genesis Global Capital and crypto exchange Gemini Trust with selling unregistered securities to retail investors through a lending program.\n\nThe total crypto market volume gained 30.38% to US$22.57 billion, while the global crypto market capitalization dropped 0.78% to US$1.12 trillion.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFTs sales drop\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market.

        "content": "The revelation came a few months into her divorce proceedings\n\nWith financial infidelity on the rise, many people are now hiding their wealth in crypto wallets, away from the prying eyes of their spouses. In one such recent case, a woman in New York discovered that her husband had stored 12 bitcoins worth $500,000 in a previously undisclosed crypto wallet, CNBC reported. The revelation came a few months into her divorce proceedings.\n\nThe woman identified as Sarita, became suspicious because her husband, who earned some $3 million a year, wasn't disclosing many assets in the divorce case. She then enlisted the help of a forensic accountant who tracked down his cryptocurrency investment using analysis of blockchain transactions to trace hidden assets.\n\n''I know of Bitcoin and things like that. I just didn't know much about it. It was never even a thought in my mind, because it's not like we were discussing it or making investments together. ... It was definitely a shock,'' Sarita said.\n\nDivorce attorneys told the outlet it is becoming common for people to hide crypto from their partners. Lamenting the growing trend, they noted that the law is struggling to keep up with digital assets that largely exist outside the reach of centralised intermediaries such as banks.\n\nAttorneys in Florida, Texas, New York, and California told CNBC that crypto now plays a role in roughly 20% to 50% of divorces they handle since it has become a more popular investment in recent years.\n\n''The thing with cryptocurrency is it's not regulated by any kind of centralized bank, so usually you can't subpoena somebody and get documents and information related to somebody's cryptocurrency holdings,'' divorce attorney Kelly Burris told CNBC. She added it is easy to hide cryptocurrency assets if one spouse is tech-savvy and the other is not.\n\nAccording to an NBC News poll, 1 in 5 Americans have invested in, traded, or used cryptocurrency, with men between the ages of 18 and 49 accounting for the highest share of all demographic groups."

But pizza parties on Bitcoin Pizza Day deserve one.\n\nThirteen years ago today, Laszlo Hanyecz created a thread in the bitcointalk.org forum titled Pizza for bitcoins? After some explanation and much discussion, Hanyecz found someone willing to buy him two pizzas (valued at ~$41) in exchange for his 10,000 bitcoin.\n\nAt bitcoin\u2019s price today, those pizzas are worth ~$270,000,000.\n\nMany look back on Bitcoin Pizza Day as a cautionary tale that demonstrates why people HODL crypto for the long term. Yet, many others look to the future on this day while considering the unrealized potential of Bitcoin and the power of decentralization.\n\nUltimately, Bitcoin Pizza Day has become a celebration of Bitcoin\u2019s viability as a complete \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic cash system\u201d \u2014 just as Satoshi envisioned in the Bitcoin white paper.\n\nMoney (including cash) is generally defined as:\n\nA medium of exchange A unit of account A store of value\n\nOn this day more than a decade ago, the world saw that Bitcoin could be used as a medium of exchange. After all, Hanyecz was able to use Bitcoin while transacting with another individual \u2014 without any intermediary\u2019s participation.\n\nYet, as time has gone on, Bitcoin Pizza Day has also become a reminder of the progress Bitcoin has made in the other two functions of money as well.\n\nAs individuals continue to exchange Bitcoin for goods and services \u2014 just as Hanyecz did years ago \u2014 Bitcoin\u2019s viability as a global unit of account and independent store of value has also emerged. Days like today are a reminder that first proving its effectiveness as a medium of exchange is what has ultimately allowed Bitcoin to prove its legitimacy as a globally recognized unit of account and self-sovereign store of value as well.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is a celebration of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology\u2019s effectiveness in decentralizing information. It is also a celebration of Bitcoin\u2019s reliability as a sound form of money.\n\nFor many others, Bitcoin Pizza Day is a celebration of the crypto values Kraken embodies and the mission we deliver on each day. It is a celebration of the freedom that Bitcoin brings back to individuals\u2019 ability to connect and transact.\n\nCelebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day with Kraken Kraken makes it easy to share the gift of financial freedom on Bitcoin Pizza Day.

        "content": "Savoring Bitcoin Pizza Day, we embark on a journey exploring the evolution of crypto payments, from a modest beginning to worldwide acceptance, driven by enthusiasm and a pioneering spirit. This momentous occasion, when Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC in 2010, signifies the first real-world transaction utilizing Bitcoin.\n\nUnderstanding the context of Bitcoin Pizza Day sheds light on the rapid evolution of Bitcoin as a speculative, experimental means of value transfer to the monumental financial ecosystem powered by blockchain that exists today.\n\nAt a fundamental level, Hanyecz\u2019s pizza transaction was the first instance in which Bitcoin \u2013 envisioned by Nakamoto as a decentralized means of peer-to-peer value transfer \u2013 was actually used as such.\n\nFrom Baboon Bones to Decentralized Ledgers \u2013 Hanyecz as a Pioneer of Monetary Evolution\n\nDefining the first time in human history at which money was used to exchange value, with coinage or similar as a proxy for value, can be somewhat difficult. Take a look at the Wikipedia page for the history of money \u2013 historians prefer to split the genesis of money between \u201cmoney of account,\u201d referring to the first time in which value was accounted via debits and credits on rudimentary ledgers, and \u201cmoney of exchange,\u201d referring to the medium of exchange.\n\nThe first recorded instance of \u201cmoney of account\u201d can be traced back to prehistory, over 30,000 years ago, with archeological discoveries including baboon thigh bones used for accounting almost 20,000 years ago. All further innovations regarding money of account in history generally rely upon advancements in the manner in which money is accounted for, while still relying on trusted third parties or authority in order to verify the movement of value.\n\nThe Bitcoin whitepaper and genesis block can therefore be considered the first major innovation in the management or recording of \u201cmoney of account\u201d in over 30 millenia, as the first implementation of money of account that functions in a decentralized manner.\n\nHanyecz\u2019s Pizza transaction represents the fulfillment of a basic and very relatable human need \u2013 the need for pizza. While 10,000 BTC represents a staggering fiat value today, the evolutionary and philosophical depth to the transaction represents something more valuable: the first instance in which one human exchanged value with another, for food, using money of account logged, tracked, and transferred through a wholly decentralized means \u2013 without the need for a \u201ctrusted third party.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand Hanyecz\u2019s passion and excitement for his multi-million dollar pizza deal. At the time, Hanyecz understood Bitcoin as a means of monetary exchange that, aside from the implications of using a wholly decentralized currency to pay for goods and services, allowed him to pull \u201cmoney\u201d from the ether through Bitcoin mining and translate it into something that could be eaten \u2013 a bridge from the digital to the real.\n\nHanyecz, as a Bitcoin miner, realized he had found a way to \u201coutsmart\u201d the incumbent financial system and benefit from it, which gave a feeling of triumph. The can be seen as resourcefulness and a desire for self-sufficiency, a trait common in most leaders. The miner\u2019s enthusiasm on how a hobby for using his skills and technology to achieve a personal goal highlights their determination to stay curious, passionate and adapt to all kinds of changes that life has to offer is a gift.\n\nFrom this humble origin, cryptocurrency payments have come a long way, transforming the financial landscape and paving the way for a decentralized, borderless economy. As we honor this milestone, let us reflect on the progress made and envision a future where digital currencies continue to revolutionize commerce and empower individuals globally.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Journey from a Slice to Global Adoption\n\nSince the historic Bitcoin Pizza Day, the use of cryptocurrencies for payments has grown exponentially. Today, thousands of merchants worldwide accept Bitcoin and other digital currencies as a form of payment, and the number continues to grow. Major companies like Microsoft, Overstock, and Expedia have embraced cryptocurrencies, while payment processors like BitPay and Coinbase Commerce have made it easier for businesses to accept digital currencies.\n\nThe growth of cryptocurrencies has also led to the development of new digital assets, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple, each with its unique features and use cases. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) further highlights the versatility and potential of blockchain technology.\n\nMoreover, the increasing interest from institutional investors and the entry of traditional financial institutions into the crypto space have contributed to the mainstream adoption of digital currencies. Governments and central banks worldwide are also exploring the potential of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which could further revolutionize the global financial landscape.\n\nThe Evolution of Cryptocurrency Payments\n\nSince Bitcoin\u2019s inception in 2009, the cryptocurrency payment landscape has undergone significant transformations. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, which eliminates intermediaries like banks, has made them increasingly popular for secure and tamper-proof transactions. The development of blockchain technology has further fueled the growth of cryptocurrencies, as it provides a transparent and immutable record of transactions.\n\nA study conducted by Geva, Benjamin (2019) titled \u201cCryptocurrencies and the Evolution of Banking, Money, and Payments\u201d concluded that the rise of crypto payments represents an evolution in banking that enhances payment intermediation. This development could potentially lead to the demise of banks as payment intermediaries. Geva\u2019s conclusion remains unchanged even if centralized digital currencies were to supersede cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe study highlights the potential for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to disrupt traditional banking systems and reshape the financial landscape. As more individuals and businesses adopt cryptocurrencies for transactions, the role of banks as intermediaries may diminish, paving the way for a more decentralized, transparent, and efficient financial ecosystem.\n\nGlobal Adoption of Crypto Payments\n\nThe global adoption of crypto payments has been steadily increasing over the past few years, with more businesses and individuals recognizing the potential benefits of using cryptocurrencies for transactions. There are several factors contributing to this growth:\n\nWidespread Business Crypto Payment Adoption\n\nMany businesses, both large and small, have started accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. This includes online retailers, service providers, and even brick-and-mortar stores. The growing number of businesses accepting cryptocurrencies has made it more convenient for consumers to use digital currencies for everyday transactions.\n\nThe number of merchants accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment has grown significantly over the past few years. Companies like BitPay, CoinGate have made it easier for businesses to accept cryptocurrencies, with over 15,000 merchants using BitPay alone. Major companies such as Microsoft, AT&T, and Overstock.com have also started accepting cryptocurrencies as payment.\n\nMainstream Celebrities and Companies Join the Crypto Revolution\n\nThe involvement of major companies like Tesla, Square, and MicroStrategy in the cryptocurrency space has helped legitimize digital currencies and increase public awareness. Additionally, endorsements from celebrities like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Paris Hilton have further boosted the popularity of cryptocurrencies.\n\nGovernment and Public Sector Adoption\n\nGovernments around the world have been taking notice of cryptocurrencies and implementing regulations and policies to govern their use. While some countries have imposed strict regulations or outright bans, others have adopted more supportive stances, creating a conducive environment for the growth of crypto payments.\n\nThe Future of Cryptocurrency Payments\n\nThe future of cryptocurrency payments is uncertain but holds great potential. Several factors will determine the trajectory of crypto payments in the coming years:\n\nMainstream Adoption and Crypto Ubiquity\n\nFor cryptocurrencies to become a widely accepted form of payment, they must overcome challenges related to scalability, transaction speed, and user-friendliness. As more people become familiar with digital currencies and their benefits, the likelihood of mainstream adoption increases.\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles that hinders mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency is trust and education \u2013 while crypto enthusiasts and web3 natives are quick to adopt the latest developments in blockchain tech, how many of us can say that our own family members are familiar with or use crypto as a daily payment method?\n\nThis is one of the biggest issues KuCoin is tackling \u2013 over the next few months, KuCoin is working on helping both the crypto community at large, and their extended family, friends, and network, learn about the unlimited potential of crypto through some exciting educational resources.\n\nChallenges and Barriers to Everyday Use\n\nCryptocurrencies face several challenges that could hinder their widespread adoption, including unpredictable hurdles, security concerns, and market volatility. Overcoming these challenges will be crucial for the continued growth of crypto payments.\n\nInnovation and Technology\n\nThe role of innovation and technology in shaping the future of crypto payments cannot be overstated. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, new solutions to existing challenges may emerge, making cryptocurrencies more accessible and practical for everyday use.\n\nThe story of Bitcoin Pizza Day serves as a reminder of the humble beginnings of cryptocurrency payments and the incredible progress that has been made since then. As we continue to explore the potential of blockchain and digital currencies, the spirit of innovation and openness to new possibilities will be essential in shaping the future of crypto payments.\n\nFrom the first Bitcoin pizza purchase to the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies as a payment method, the journey of crypto payments has been nothing short of remarkable. As the market continues to grow and mature, it is likely that we will see even greater adoption of cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions, further solidifying their place in the global financial ecosystem.\n\nHappy Bitcoin Pizza Day!\n\nAbout Johnny Lyu\n\nJohnny Lyu is the CEO of KuCoin, the top 5 cryptocurrency exchange launched in 2017.

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts celebrated the shift as a critical step toward mass adoption, while economists trashed the idea and mourned for the Salvadoran people.\n\nSince becoming the first country in the world to officially adopt Bitcoin, the Salvadoran Government is more committed than ever to its blockchain-based future. Regardless of volatility in the crypto market, president Nayib Bukele\u2019s resolve remains unswayed.\n\nEven after the collapse of FTX, when digital currency looked to be finished forever (again), the Bukele government doubled down and announced they\u2019d buy one bitcoin daily. Despite the government\u2019s confidence, the Salvadoran public\u2019s usage and adoption of Bitcoin remains low.\n\nWith the construction of Bitcoin City lagging and the price of Bitcoin still far from all-time highs, is time running out for Nayib Bukele\u2019s vision?\n\nLegal Tender Pioneers\n\nAfter proposing the bill on June 5th at the Bitcoin Conference in Miami, El Salvador officially adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender on September 7, 2021. At the time, BTC was trading at around $50,000, and market sentiment had never been higher.\n\nLong before the Bitcoin Law came into effect, pockets of El Salvadoran society had been using the digital asset as a currency of exchange. The local economy of El Zonte, a coastal fishing village, had been transacting in BTC for years.\n\nEven during his tenure as the Mayor of San Salvador, the nation\u2019s capital, Nayib Bukele, had expressed an interest in the national adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nWhile many businesses accepted Bitcoin before the announcement, its status as legal tender means that operators must accept BTC as payment.\n\nWhy Did President Nayib Bukele Adopt Bitcoin?\n\nIn many respects, the Central American nation is a perfect example of why Bitcoin was created in the first place. According to Nayib Bukele, 70% of the El Salvadoran people don\u2019t have a bank account and live and work in an informal economy.\n\nHowever, mobile internet usage in the country is widespread, with over 9.94 million active mobile connections in early 2023. This figure represents around 156% of the total population and indicates that a mobile-first financial service, like a Bitcoin wallet, would be far more accessible than traditional central banks.\n\nAround 25% of El Salvador\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) comes from remittance payments. This means that a significant portion of wealth within the country comes in from overseas payments. Remittance fees are typically high, sometimes costing around 30-50% of the value of the transfer.\n\nLike many Central American nations, El Salvador uses the US Dollar as its national currency. In 2001, the El Salvadoran government began de-circulating their previous currency, the Salvadoran col\u00f3n, replacing it with USD as the more stable and secure national currency.\n\nTwenty years later, the Salvadoran government wanted to move away from its reliance on the US dollar and its loss of value due to inflation.\n\nWhat Are the Risks of Using Bitcoin as a Legal Tender?\n\nUsing Bitcoin as a legal tender has raised many concerns among the Salvadoran public. There are concerns that the cryptocurrency network will be used for scams and money laundering. The Salvadoran government argues Bitcoin has the opposite effect; blockchain\u2019s transparency means that tracking funds is easier than ever.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has implored El Salvador to reverse its decision about using Bitcoin as a legal tender. They argue that the cryptocurrency is too volatile and poses a risk to the nation\u2019s financial stability and consumer protection.\n\nIf the price of Bitcoin drops significantly, there is a substantial risk that the El Salvadoran government will default on its loans and be unable to repay its lenders.\n\nBitcoin City\n\nWith the vision of turning El Salvador into a cryptocurrency utopia, Nayib Bukele has promised to build Bitcoin City on the side of a volcano. The proposed city is expected to be built on the Gulf of Fonseca on the nation\u2019s southern coast.\n\nGeothermic energy harnessed from the Conchagua volcano will be used to operate Bitcoin mining operations. Additionally, Bukele envisions a digital asset tax haven with no income or capital gains tax. This is expected to attract wealth and investment to El Salvador.\n\nTo fund the construction of Bitcoin City, the Salvadoran government will begin the issuance of Bitcoin Bonds. The first ten-year issue is known as the \u2018Volcano Bond\u2019 and is estimated to be worth around $1B. Half of the funds raised are invested in Bitcoin, with the rest being put towards the development of Bitcoin City.\n\nHas El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Bet Paid Off?\n\nFrom an investment standpoint, El Salvador\u2019s BTC holdings are still at a loss. According to Bloomberg, El Salvador holds approximately 2,546 BTC acquired at a cost basis of around $108 million. For these holdings to break even, the price of one bitcoin must be $42,419.\n\nFrom a social perspective, it\u2019s hard to gauge the success of Bukele\u2019s move. As an incentive during the initial rollout, the Salvadoran government gifted every citizen $30 in BTC. Everyone who downloaded the Chivo wallet, El Salvador\u2019s national wallet, was eligible. However, according to Reuters, usage rates indicate that just 20% of users have continued using the app since claiming the sign-up bonus.\n\nA recent study by the University of Central America found that 77% of respondents believed Bukele\u2019s Bitcoin experiment failed. Perceived security seems a significant roadblock, with many citizens not understanding and trusting Bitcoin.\n\nDespite negative sentiment from the population, Nayib Bukele remains committed to the future. The latest news out of the country suggests that the Salvadoran government has paid off over $800 million in debts.\n\nBukele was happy to call out the hundreds of mainstream media articles suggesting he would default on the loan.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s still too early to say whether the adoption of Bitcoin has been a successful endeavor for the nation. The verdict will likely be directly correlated to Bitcoin price as opposed to its effectiveness as a network.\n\nBitcoin Legal Tender: Who\u2019s Next?\n\nWhile El Salvador is leading the charge regarding Bitcoin adoption, it\u2019s not the only nation with its eyes on the digital horizon. Other Latin American countries like Paraguay and Panama have shown an interest in Bitcoin and have progressive laws around mining and taxation.\n\nWhen Paraguay proposed a bill to make Bitcoin a legal tender in June 2021, things looked positive for Paraguayan crypto enthusiasts. The South American country has a reputation as a top destination for Bitcoin mining.\n\nConversely, Panama has passed a bill that aims to make the nation more crypto-friendly. While Bitcoin is not yet legal tender, profits from cryptocurrency-related endeavors are not subject to capital gains tax.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is far from perfect. Even with upgrades like the Lightning Network, it\u2019s still comparatively slow and expensive. Recent gas spikes from Ordinal NFTs and BRC-20 tokens have congested the network and driven transaction fees to all-time highs, proving that Bitcoin still has some scalability issues.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWhile Bitcoin being recognized as a legal tender is undoubtedly a step toward mass adoption, El Salvador\u2019s experiment will have huge ramifications on how the digital asset is perceived. If Bitcoin\u2019s price drops and El Salvador becomes insolvent, it is doubtful that another country would want to adopt BTC.\n\nFAQs"

The woman \u2014 addressed pseudonymously as Sarita \u2014 revealed to CNBC that her husband was earning $3 million annually, which was not reflective of his declared assets.\n\nSarita appointed a forensic accountant, who eventually found that her husband failed to declare 12 BTC \u2014 worth roughly $500,000 \u2014 stored in an undisclosed crypto wallet. Having no clue about the Bitcoin investment, she stated:\n\n\u201cIt was never even a thought in my mind because it\u2019s not like we were discussing it or making investments together.

        "content": "Bitcoin Miami: 2024 Candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr and Gabbard Defend Bitcoin and Decentralization\n\nUS Democratic presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr and Tulsi Gabbard came out in a vigorous defense of Bitcoin and its ideals of decentralization and privacy. Speaking on the second day of Bitcoin 2023 in Miami, the pair delivered a strong rebuke of the United States\u2019 current lack of clear crypto guidance for investors and entrepreneurs and stifling incoming regulations.\n\nKennedy is currently trailing President Joe Biden with 19% of votes vs 62% in the race for the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination in next year\u2019s election according to early polls. He had a particularly warm reception to his keynote speech on the first day.\n\nThe US has displayed a particular affinity for the Kennedy clan over the years, and its latest political candidate\u2019s stellar environmental law and civil rights track record, and strong views on individual freedom, environmental protection, and the right to refuse vaccinations, also resonate strongly with a big contingent of the Bitcoin community,\n\nIn his first public appearance as a presidential candidate, Kennedy laid out a supportive vision for Bitcoin ownership and mining in the States, and warned against the dangers of governments utilizing technology to control their citizens. The civil rights activist and lawyer also announced that he would accept Bitcoin donations for his campaign, thereby becoming the first presidential candidate to greenlight the reception of crypto for a run to the Oval Office.\n\nKennedy noted that he first realized the importance of Bitcoin\u2019s ability to circumvent government intervention after he witnessed Canada\u2019s handling of the trucker protests last year. In his eyes, the protests were peaceful without violating any laws, yet protesters couldn\u2019t access their money and bank accounts in order to support their families.\n\nKennedy\u2019s 5 Pro-crypto Promises\n\nIn what he deemed as a \u201cdevastating use of government repression,\u201d Kennedy said he saw for the first time how free money was equal in importance to free speech, and made a few key promises to the crypto space, saying he would:\n\nStory continues\n\n1. Defend the right to self-custody Bitcoin and other digital assets in the US\n\n2. Uphold the right to run a node at home\n\n3. Defend use-agnostic and industry-neutral regulation of energy\n\n4. Make sure that the US remains the global hub of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and reverse the government\u2019s growing hostility toward the industry\n\n5. Review whether individuals like Ross Ulbricht were prosecuted \u201cfor actual crimes, or as a means to crackdown on crypto.\u201d In the case of the latter, he would consider swiftly pardoning them.\n\nOn Bitcoin Mining and AI\n\nKennedy also took a shot at incumbent president Biden and his 30% energy tax on Bitcoin mining:\n\n\u201cPresident Biden's 30% tax on energy for Bitcoin miners requires an invasive surveillance apparatus to monitor what is happening in individual computers. It sets a terrible precedent in which everything that you do requires electricity and must now be monitored by the government. That's why I also support people's rights to refuse smart meters in their homes.\u201d\n\nWhile he stated that he doesn\u2019t own any Bitcoin, Kennedy underscored its importance in a world of new threats to democracy such as increasing governmental interference:\n\n\u201c...we are now living in this age of turnkey totalitarianism with this emerging technology, which can empower totalitarian regimes. And our job is to try to build and fortify democratic institutions at the same rate as totalitarian instruments are being expanded in their power.\u201d\n\nKennedy also touched on the malicious use of artificial intelligence:\n\n\u201cFor things like AI which really are going to threaten democracy at its base, we need to not be chipping away at our democratic institutions. We need to fortify the ones that exist and build new ones and the biggest most important one on the horizon is Bitcoin because it can't be manipulated.\u201d\n\nGabbard Takes Aim at Democrats and CBDCs\n\nTulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Hawaii, came out eloquently against the direction of her party as well as the implementation of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\nShe said she related to Kennedy\u2019s speech earlier, as she knew a little bit of something about this:\n\n\u201cThey make an example of those of us who dare to speak the truth and call out what is common sense and obvious to the rest of us about their hidden insanity and hypocrisy. Hoping that by making an example of us, they will then cause the rest of us to self-censor ourselves to fall in line and to comply.\u201d\n\nThe ex-congresswoman aired her dissatisfaction with the current state of the Democratic Party and its leadership, arguing that the party has become elitist and intolerant of dissent, seeking power at any cost.\n\nShe criticized the mainstream media, big tech, and the national security state for working together to silence those who challenge the party's narrative.\n\nGabbard also highlighted the weaponization of federal agencies and law enforcement against political opponents, as revealed in the Durham report. She also expresses concerns about the Biden administration's push for a CBDC, seeing it as a threat to privacy and economic autonomy.\n\nThe presidential hopeful warned that the current \u201cpower holders prioritize control over people's lives and suppress freedom of speech\u201d and emphasized the importance of active citizenship and defending freedoms to counteract this oppression. Gabbard concluded her keynote by urging people to protect democracy and preserve the vision of the country's founders.\n\nBitcoin 2023 Pulls in Pro-Crypto Politicians\n\nBitcoin Miami 2023 played host to a string of prominent pro-crypto political speakers such as Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a venture capitalist and \u201canti-woke\u201d activist, Wyoming senator Cynthia Lummis, Governor Ridwan Kamil from West Java, Indonesia; North Carolina congressman Patrick McHenry, who last month memorably grilled SEC chair Gary Gensler in Congress; Congressman Byron Donalds, representing Florida; and David McIntosh, a former Congressman and White House Senior Staff member.\n\nOrganizers BTC Media previously said that the flagship global Bitcoin conference aims to provide a platform for the discussion of diverse perspectives and ideas. By engaging politicians open to Bitcoin and deepening their understanding of the cryptocurrency, the conference seeks to foster support for the industry in Washington and beyond."

Let\u2019s remember the unsung hero that brought Bitcoin into the real world; a simple slice of pizza that captured the imagination of a community and played a part in the remarkable journey of Bitcoin.\n\nA historic event took place on May 22, 2010\n\nA remarkable event unfolded in the early days of Bitcoin when the idea of digital currencies was still in its infancy. A fervent Bitcoin supporter, Laszlo Hanyecz, requested a pizza on an internet forum and offered a mind-blowing 10,000 BTC as payment. It was a light-hearted request meant to demonstrate Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a medium of exchange.\n\nRelated: Why do we need cryptocurrencies?\n\nWhat happened next would become legendary: Hanyecz received two pizzas at his doorstep after pizza restaurant chain Papa John\u2019s accepted his offer.

This transaction and straightforward exchange highlighted a significant turning point in the evolution of digital currency.\n\nBitcoin did not have much value at the time.

        "title": "These 4 altcoins could be ready for an up-move if Bitcoin rallies above $27,500 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Inexperienced traders usually chase prices higher during the end of the bull phase as they fear missing out on the rally. However, institutional investors tend to wait for the froth to settle before entering. Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) bear market in 2022 ended the hype that was seen in 2021.\n\nFred Pye, CEO of 3iQ, Canada\u2019s first Bitcoin fund issuer, said in an interview with Cointelegraph that as \u201cthe FOMO in Bitcoin is gone\u201d institutional investors and portfolio managers have started to take a look at it as \u201ca serious venue.\u201d\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nWhile analysts are bullish for the long term, the short-term picture looks uncertain as the price is stuck inside a range for the past several days. Analysts expect a trending move to start either next week or the week after.\n\nIf Bitcoin breaks out to the upside, what are the altcoins that may follow it higher? Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may rally in the short term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been trading near the support line of the symmetrical triangle but the bulls have failed to push the price above it. This indicates that the bears are active at higher levels.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($27,481) and the relative strength index below 42 indicate that bears are at an advantage.\n\nIf the sellers sink the price below the immediate support at $26,361, the BTC/USDT pair may tumble to the crucial support zone between $25,800 and $25,250. Buyers are expected to protect this zone with all their might because if they fail, the pair could nosedive to $20,000.\n\nConversely, if bulls kick the price above the 20-day EMA, it may attract further buying. The pair could then rise toward the resistance line of the triangle. If this barrier is overcome, the pair may start its journey to $32,400.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating uncertainty among the bulls and the bears. The flattening moving averages also point to a balance between supply and demand.\n\nIf the price collapses below the triangle, the short-term trend will turn negative and the pair could drop to $25,800. The pattern target of the triangle is $24,773.\n\nThis bearish view will be negated if the price surges above the triangle. The pair could then climb to $28,400 and thereafter to the pattern target of $29,165.\n\nXRP price analysis\n\nXRP (XRP) is trying to start a recovery. Buyers have been sustaining the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.45) since May 16 but they haven\u2019t been able to overcome the obstacle at the 50-day SMA ($0.47).\n\nXRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating that bulls have a slight advantage. That increases the likelihood of a rally above the 50-day SMA. The XRP/USDT pair could then start a rally to $0.54 and eventually to $0.58. This zone is likely to witness aggressive selling by the bears.\n\nThe first support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA. Sellers will have to yank the price below this level to gain the upper hand. The pair may then descend to $0.43 and later to the crucial support at $0.40.\n\nXRP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the recovery reversed direction from the downtrend line. This shows that the bears are fiercely guarding the downtrend line. Sellers are trying to maintain the price below the 20-EMA and stretch the pullback to the 50-SMA.\n\nInstead, if the price turns up from the current level and climbs above the downtrend line, it will suggest the start of a short-term up-move. There is a minor resistance at $0.48 but it is likely to be crossed. The pair may then rally to $0.54.\n\nLitecoin price analysis\n\nLitecoin (LTC) has been trading in a tight range between the 50-day SMA ($89) and the overhead resistance of $96 for the past few days. This shows indecision between the bulls and the bears.\n\nLTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($88) has turned up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the bulls have the edge. This enhances the prospects of a rally above the resistance at $96. If that happens, the LTC/USDT pair could rally to $106. This level may again attract strong selling by the bears.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the pair may remain stuck between $79 and $96 for some more time.\n\nLTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls are trying to defend the 20-EMA. This indicates a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. If the price bounces off the current level, the bulls will again try to clear the overhead hurdle at $96.\n\nHowever, the bears are not going to give up without a fight. They are trying to sink the price below the 20-EMA. If they are successful, the pair may crumble to the 50-SMA. A collapse of this support may open the doors for a fall to $86 and then $82.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin, Ethereum bears are back in control \u2014 Two derivative metrics suggest\n\nRender Token price analysis\n\nRender Token (RNDR) is in an uptrend. Buyers kicked the price above the overhead resistance of $2.60 on May 21 but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels.\n\nRNDR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping moving averages and the RSI just below the overbought area indicate that bulls are in command. Buyers will make another attempt to propel the price above the psychological barrier at $3. If they manage to do that, the RNDR/USDT pair may rally to $3.35.\n\nThe first support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($2.10). If this level gives way, it will suggest that the break above $2.60 may have been a bull trap. The pair could then plunge to the 50-day SMA ($1.87).\n\nRNDR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls are struggling to sustain the price above the overhead resistance at $2.60, pointing toward the possibility of a bull trap. Sellers will try to strengthen their position by pulling the price below the immediate support at the 20-EMA. If they do that, the pair may decline to the 50-SMA.\n\nHowever, the rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that lower levels are likely to be purchased. If buyers push and maintain the price above $2.60, the pair could soar to $3.\n\nConflux price analysis\n\nConflux (CFX) is trading inside a descending channel pattern. The bulls purchased the dip to the support line on May 12, indicating solid demand at lower levels.\n\nCFX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($0.29) has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, suggesting that the selling pressure has reduced.\n\nBuyers tried to clear the overhead hurdle at the 50-day SMA ($0.32) on May 16 but the bears held their ground. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to dip back below the 20-day EMA. This signals buying on dips.\n\nThe bulls are likely to make one more attempt to propel the price above the 50-day SMA. If they succeed, the CFX/USDT pair may reach the downtrend line, which is again likely to act as a formidable resistance.\n\nCFX/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price is correcting the sharp rally from $0.22 to $0.33. Buyers are trying to defend the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.29, which is a positive sign.\n\nIf buyers sustain the price above the resistance line, it will suggest that bulls are back in the driver\u2019s seat. The pair may first rise to $0.33 and thereafter to $0.37. Alternatively, a break and close below $0.29 could start a deeper correction toward $0.28 and then 0.27.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nSpeaking to a packed audience on the final day of the 2023 Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Fla., Democratic presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr. decisively built Bitcoin into his campaign platform, saying the cryptocurrency must be defended against what he called \"invasive surveillance.\"\n\n\"We live in a time now that technology has dangerously expanded the capacity for governments and corporations to control our lives,\" Kennedy said. \"Distant, impersonal multinationals and authoritarian technologies have usurped realms of human activity that were once private or held by the community.\"\n\nKennedy added that these technologies monitor movements, communications, and transactions, pointing to the trucker protest in Ottawa, Canada, in 2022 as an example.\n\nHe said Bitcoin won him over when he witnessed the Canadian administration using surveillance and data tracking systems to block truckers who were protesting COVID mandates from accessing their bank accounts in a bid to end the demonstration.\n\n\"When I witnessed this cataclysm, this devastating use of government repression, I realized for the first time how free money is as important to freedom as free expression,\" Kennedy said.\n\nDuring his keynote address, Kennedy took aim at President Joe Biden's proposed 30% tax on energy use for Bitcoin miners saying it would require an invasive surveillance apparatus to monitor miner energy usage.\n\nInitially introduced in the White House\u2019s 2024 budget, the Biden Administration called for a 30% crypto mining tax, saying that crypto mining consumed almost as much energy, 50,000 gigawatts of electricity, as televisions and home computers in 2022.\n\nThe energy consumed by mining cryptocurrency has long been a cudgel used against proof-of-work blockchains. Proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin consume significant energy due to the computational power required to solve the complex mathematical problems involved in mining.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"It sets a terrible precedent in which everything that you do that requires electricity must now be monitored by the government,\" Kennedy said, adding that he would support people\u2019s right to refuse smart meters in their homes.\n\nKennedy had already stepped into the digital currency arena after opposing a U.S. central bank digital currency, or CBDC, and saying the U.S. government was waging a \"war on crypto.\"\n\n\"As President,\" Kennedy told the audience. \"I will make sure that your right to hold and use Bitcoin is inviolable, [and] I will defend the right of self-custody.\"\n\nNot only would Kennedy protect the right to hold Bitcoin, he assured the crowd, he also pledged to uphold the right to run a private node\u2014saying that Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements should be applied at the level of banks and exchanges, not at the level of nodes.\n\n\"I don't think the government has the right to demand access to your Bitcoin key or indeed any of your passwords,\" Kennedy said. \"To say otherwise is to cede essential territory to the surveillance state.\"\n\n\"The whole point of Bitcoin is that it's decentralized,\" Kennedy said. \"Anyone can run a node, and it's important not only for Bitcoin but for democracy to be decentralized.\""

        "content": "A bearish market structure has been pressuring cryptocurrencies\u2019 prices for the past six weeks, driving the total market capitalization to its lowest level in two months at $1.13 trillion. According to two derivatives metrics, crypto bulls will have a hard time to break the downtrend, even though analyzing a shorter timeframe provides a neutral view, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and BNB, on average, gaining 0.3% between May 12 and May 19.\n\nTotal crypto market cap in USD, 12-hour. Source: TradingView\n\nNotice that the descending wedge formation initiated in mid-April could last until July, indicating that an eventual break to the upside would require an extra effort from the bulls.\n\nFurthermore, there\u2019s the impending U.S. debt ceiling standoff, as the U.S. Treasury is quickly running out of cash.\n\nEven if the majority of investors believe that the Biden administration will be able to strike a deal before the effective default of its debt, no one can exclude the possibility of a government shutdown and subsequent default.\n\nGold or stablecoins as a safe haven?\n\nNot even gold, which used to be considered the world\u2019s safest asset class, has been immune to the recent correction, as the precious metal traded down from $2,050 on May 4 to the present $1,980 level.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin, gold and the debt ceiling \u2014 Does something have to give?\n\nCircle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has ditched $8.7 billion in Treasurys maturing in longer than 30 days for short-term bonds and collateralized loans at banking giants such as Goldman Sachs and Royal Bank of Canada.\n\nAccording to Markets Insider, a Circle representative stated that:\n\n\u201cThe inclusion of these highly liquid assets also provides additional protection for the USDC reserve in the unlikely event of a U.S. debt default.\u201d\n\nThe stablecoin DAI, managed by the decentralized organization MakerDAO, approved in March an increase to its portfolio holdings of the U.S. Treasurys to $1.25 billion to \u201ctake advantage of the current yield environment and generate further revenue.\u201d\n\nDerivatives markets show no signs of bearishness\n\nPerpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours.\n\nA positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. Still, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.\n\nPerpetual futures accumulated 7-day funding rate on May 19. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe seven-day funding rate for BTC and ETH was neutral, indicating balanced demand from leveraged longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) using perpetual futures contracts. Curiously, even Litecoin (LTC) displayed no excessive long demand after a 14.5% weekly rally.\n\nTo exclude externalities that might have solely impacted futures markets, traders can gauge the market\u2019s sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options.\n\nBTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe expiration of options can add volatility to Bitcoin\u2019s price, which resulted in an $80-million advantage for bears in the latest May 19 expiry.\n\nA 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put option open interest lags the more bullish calls and is, therefore, bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, which can be deemed bearish.\n\nThe put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options volume has been below 1.0 for the past couple of weeks, indicating a higher preference for neutral-to-bullish call options. More importantly, even as Bitcoin briefly corrected down to $26,800 on May 12, there was no significant surge in demand for the protective put options.\n\nGlass half full, or investors prepping for the worst?\n\nThe options market shows whales and market makers unwilling to take protective puts even after Bitcoin crashed 8.3% between May 10 and May 12.\n\nHowever, given the balanced demand on futures markets, traders seem hesitant to place additional bets until there\u2019s more clarity on the U.S. debt standoff.\n\nLess than two weeks remain until June 1, when the U.S. Treasury Department has warned that the federal government could be unable to pay its debts.\n\nRelated: U.S. debt ceiling crisis: bullish or bearish for Bitcoin?\n\nIt is unclear whether the total market capitalization will be able to break from the descending wedge formation. From an optimistic perspective, professional traders are not using derivatives to bet on a catastrophic scenario.\n\nOn the other hand, there seems to be no rationale for the bulls to jump the gun and place bets on a speedy crypto market recovery, given the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. So, ultimately, bears are in a comfortable place according to derivatives metrics.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Here's how to use DeFi on Bitcoin without 'polluting' the blockchain - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is known for its immutability and the hard-coded rules that make the system secure but slow to modernize. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 the underlying network that empowers the original cryptocurrency \u2014 is closed to innovation and development. Even though the initial efforts to introduce decentralized finance (DeFi) to Bitcoin such as cross-chain bridges and wrapped tokens resulted in a massive wave of hacks and exploits in the DeFi space, developers continue to look for new and more reliable ways to tap into the unmatched liquidity of the BTC pool.\n\nLaunched in November 2021, the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade was an important step in adding extra functionality to the base layer of Bitcoin. Among other benefits, including cheaper and more efficient transactions, the Taproot upgrade also introduced rudimentary smart contracts \u2014 the backbone of DeFi \u2014 to Bitcoin for the first time.\n\nThe Taproot upgrade adds rudimentary smart contracts to the Bitcoin network. Source: Chaindebrief\n\nBitcoin DeFi: The first attempt\n\nSmart contracts are automated agreements between multiple parties that are stored on a blockchain. They enable a wide range of DeFi functionality. The introduction of smart contracts to the Bitcoin base layer hinted at the possibility of common DeFi trends such as nonfungible tokens (NFTs) appearing on the Bitcoin network, and developers rushed to work on it.\n\nShortly thereafter, Bitcoiners came up with their version of NFTs with the Ordinals protocol, sparking a hot debate about adding more usability to the Bitcoin base layer versus \u201ccongesting\u201d it with nonessential content. Ordinals, also known as Bitcoin NFTs, allow users to inscribe digital content on the Bitcoin blockchain. Launched in January 2023, ordinals quickly became a popular way to interact with the base layer, surpassing over 3 million inscriptions.\n\nThe total number of ordinals exceeded 3 million on May 1. Source: Dune\n\n\u200b\u200bFollowing the launch of ordinals, BRC-20 tokens emerged as an experimental token standard based on the Bitcoin Request for Comment (BRC) protocol. These tokens represented fungible assets on a 1:1 basis. However, the influx of memecoins such as Pepecoin (PEPE) on the BRC-20 standard led to a congestion problem, resulting in a backlog of 500,000 transactions awaiting settlement. This surge in demand caused transaction fees to skyrocket to $30 per transaction, significantly impacting the efficiency of the entire Bitcoin network.\n\nBitcoin DeFi: The second attempt\n\nTo make NFTs more efficient on Bitcoin, a new protocol called Bitcoin Stamps, or \u201cSecure Tradeable Art Maintained Securely,\u201d was launched shortly after the ordinals. And unlike the ordinals, Bitcoin stamps allow the minting or embedding of image data into the Bitcoin network by storing image data across multiple unspent transaction outputs to increase decentralization and immutability.\n\nAlthough the second attempt to add NFT usability to the Bitcoin network is widely considered an improvement over ordinals, Bitcoin stamps are far from providing ideal results. The protocol requires a canvas size of 24 by 24 pixels, which limits the possibilities to pixel-art NFTs.\n\nMeanwhile, the issue of \u201cpolluting\u201d the Bitcoin blockchain by storing data directly on the base layer remains unsolved. Moreover, a controversial topic still hovers over the Bitcoin community: Do we need NFTs on the main Bitcoin chain?\n\nAdditionally, just as BRC-20 spawned from ordinals, stamps formed their own tokenization standard called SRC-20. However, while SRC-20 tokens have greater immutability, they take up even more block space than BRC-20 tokens, and if their popularity would grow, it would further congest the Bitcoin network.\n\nBitcoin DeFi using Layer 2\n\nAn alternative approach aims to solve all the shortcomings of layer-1 (i.e. Bitcoin), DeFi by moving NFT and tokens to layer 2 thus decongesting Bitcoin, lowering fees, and adding additional use cases. Like the Lightning Network solved many aspects of Bitcoin payments as a layer-2 solution, NFTs and tokens can also be moved to the second layer to keep the Bitcoin base layer clean and efficient. This reduces the need for all transactions to use Bitcoin for settlement.\n\nMintlayer, a layer-2 solution that builds the tools to enable DeFi on Bitcoin, aims to open Bitcoin to NFTs along with smart contracts, atomic swaps, and decentralized applications (DApps). Using a layer-2 network directly on Bitcoin enables lower minting and transfer costs while adding smart contract features and reducing congestion on the base layer.\n\nInstead of trying to get DeFi onto the Bitcoin network through unreliable gateways such as cross-chain bridges and wrapped tokens, Mintlayer enables direct swaps of native Bitcoin for other tokenized assets minted directly on Mintlayer, eliminating all intermediaries between Bitcoin and DeFi.\n\nTo tokenize assets with tailored protocols designed for specific use cases, Mintlayer has introduced three tokenization standards. The MLS-01 is created for securities, stablecoins, and stock tokens to function on Bitcoin, while the MLS-02 is designed for confidential transactions. The third one, MLS-03, is built for NFTs only. Since it\u2019s developed specifically with NFTs in mind, there\u2019s no need to write a smart contract \u2014 unlike ordinals and Stamps. MLS-03 also unlocks the limits introduced by layer-1 attempts by leveraging the freedom of layer-2.\n\n\"It\u2019s exciting to see innovation on the Bitcoin blockchain,\u201d said Enrico Rubboli, CEO of Mintlayer, adding, \u201cBut, ultimately, NFTs and tokens need to be on layer 2. There are many constraints for NFTs and tokens in terms of size, smart contract capabilities, and immutability that Mintlayer won\u2019t be subject to.\u201d\n\nDeFi on Bitcoin allows the sustainable and efficient use of decentralized financial applications on the Bitcoin network. By offloading the complexity of DeFi to layer 2, Bitcoin users can now benefit from improved scalability, reduced transaction costs, and a wider range of financial services while still leveraging the security and robustness of the underlying Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nLearn more about Mintlayer"

Source: Internet Archive\n\nTo answer this, it is assumed that Hanyecz ordered Papa John\u2019s \u201cThe Works\u201d pizza, which is the pizza chain\u2019s version of a supreme pizza.\n\nConsidering the amount required and the price of ingredients at the time, here\u2019s what it would have cost to put together just one of the Bitcoin Pizzas, not including labor, overhead and the pizza base.\n\nPepperoni: 244 BTC = $6.5 million\n\n244 BTC = $6.5 million Bacon: 146 BTC = $3.8 million\n\n146 BTC = $3.8 million Italian sausage: 97 BTC = $2.5 million\n\n97 BTC = $2.5 million Onions: 24 BTC = $640,000\n\n24 BTC = $640,000 Green peppers: 36 BTC = $960,000\n\n36 BTC = $960,000 Mushrooms: 63 BTC = $1.6 million\n\n63 BTC = $1.6 million Black olives: 121 BTC = $3.2 million\n\n121 BTC = $3.2 million Cheese: 730 BTC = $19.4 million\n\nTotal cost of ingredients: 1,461 BTC, or $39 million.

        "content": "Today- May 22 \u2013 is the 13th anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day, a historic event that marked the first time BTC was publicly used as a medium of exchange. On 22 May 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer and early Bitcoin adopter, forever etched his name in history by purchasing two Papa John\u2019s pizzas for 10,000 BTC.\n\nAs the world celebrates the 13th Bitcoin Pizza Day, let\u2019s reflect on the astronomical growth that Bitcoin has achieved, both in value and as a viable payment method for goods and services, since that fateful day.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day\n\nAlthough the 10,000 BTC Hanyecz spent to purchase the two pizzas was worth $40 at the time of the transaction, the present value is worth an astonishing $270 million, with the asset\u2019s current price standing at $27,000. This illustrates just how much the value of Bitcoin has grown in the past decade, as well as the profit margin for early adopters who held to date.\n\nMany in the crypto community look back on Bitcoin Pizza Day with nostalgia and disbelief as they try to put themselves in Hanyecz\u2019s shoes and imagine what it must have been like to spend what would eventually become a fortune on a couple of pizzas. Others see it as an important reminder of the potential of cryptocurrencies and the power that early adopters can have in shaping the future.\n\nThe Significance of Bitcoin Pizza Day\n\nIt is worth noting that purchasing those pizzas was not just a random act of food-loving frivolity. Hanyecz\u2019s decision to use BTC to make a purchase was a deliberate attempt to test the usability of the currency in a real-world setting. At the time, Bitcoin was still a relatively unknown and untested currency, and Hanyecz\u2019s experiment was one of the first real-world applications of the technology.\n\nToday, hundreds of mainstream companies, including entertainment giant AMC, coffee maker Starbucks, and retail platform Overstock.com, accept Bitcoin and other crypto assets as payment options.\n\nHanyecz\u2019s Contributions to the Bitcoin Network\n\nBeyond his infamous pizza purchase, Laszlo Hanyecz was a significant contributor to the early development of Bitcoin. He played a crucial role in fixing many vulnerabilities in the network during its early stages, helping to make the protocol more secure and stable.\n\nHanyecz\u2019s pioneering work also extended to software development. He was the first person to release the Bitcoin code for Mac OS, which helped pave the way for the wide adoption of Bitcoin as a digital currency. Additionally, he played a vital role in transforming the Bitcoin mining landscape, laying the groundwork for today\u2019s industry\u2019s growth.\n\nLooking back on this day 13 years ago, it is clear that Hanyecz\u2019s decision to buy those pizzas for 10,000 BTC was a defining moment in the history of cryptocurrencies. It demonstrated the potential and utility of Bitcoin, paving the way for many more use cases and innovations to come."

        "content": "A leaked document distributed to Democratic House Financial Services Committee members has revealed the \u201ckey messages\u201d legislators were advised to keep to, which might result in practically all cryptocurrencies being classified as securities.\n\nAs governments and regulatory agencies impose more robust controls on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, investors and enthusiasts are left worrying about the potential repercussions.\n\nOne fascinating issue arises: if the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) tumbles, will meme currencies become more popular? Will DogeMiyagi ($MIYAGI) become the meme market leader?\n\nFurthermore, would cryptocurrencies in presale garner greater interest because they are untouched by the current market trend?\n\nThe Great Crypto Cliffhanger: Bitcoin\u2019s Precarious Position and Ethereum\u2019s Fate in the Balance\n\nAs the crypto world holds its breath, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price is perched precariously on a stable support level, making it a compelling opportunity for eager buyers to accumulate. After several failed attempts to break free and soar to new heights, BTC is back at the notorious $27,000 barrier, like a stubborn explorer refusing to surrender to the depths.\n\nOh, the drama! After seven days of relentless selling, Bitcoin\u2019s price has finally taken a break from the madness, settling down for a cosy consolidation around the familiar $27,000 support level. It\u2019s like the calm after a stormy affair, where BTC is catching its breath, unsure of its following path.\n\nWill it sweep Monday\u2019s low at $26,694, teasing us with a swift recovery and reclaiming its support level throne? Or will it succumb to the temptation of becoming a resistance barrier, shattering our bullish dreams and potentially triggering a merciless correction to $25,290 and $23,905 levels? The plot thickens.\n\nMeanwhile, our beloved Ethereum (ETH) has been busy cooking up some technical mischief. Picture this: a bearish divergence sells signal on the daily chart, unfolding its treacherous formation between January 14 and May 13, leaving unsuspecting investors in disbelief.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike a magician revealing their trickery, this wicked move sent ETH on a 17% freefall, leaving it gasping for air at the measly $1,735 mark. But fear not! Hope lies in the mystical realm of critical support floors, and ETH\u2019s saviour awaits at the sacred $1,705 level. If it can summon the strength to bounce back from this abyss, a glimmer of light might shine through, guiding it on a heroic journey towards the superb $2,028 destination.\n\nBut patience, dear investors, patience! Remember, the tale of Ethereum\u2019s fate is yet to be written, and it eagerly awaits Bitcoin\u2019s proclamation of direction. In this mesmerising world of cryptocurrencies, where fortunes rise and fall with the flicker of a digital heartbeat, one thing remains clear: the intricate dance of Bitcoin sets the stage for its companion, Ethereum.\n\nThe Rise of Meme Coins: Exploring the Allure and Potential of DogeMiyagi in the Crypto Market\n\nThe general public is drawn to meme coins because of the possibility of rapid returns and the entertaining and dynamic communities surrounding them. While meme currencies lack the technological complexity and use cases of Bitcoin and Ethereum, their popularity stems from their ease of usage, low cost, and viral growth potential. The current crackdown on mainstream cryptocurrencies may have created a void that meme coins might fill, luring buyers looking for new investment possibilities.\n\nThe presale of meme coins is another important factor in their success.\n\nDuring a market downturn, presale cryptocurrencies provide a unique opportunity for investors. These new currencies are introduced through presales or initial coin offers (ICOs), which allow investors to purchase tokens before they are available on the general market. Because market trends do not yet influence presale coins, they enable investors to enter the market at an early stage.\n\nOverall, coins, let us welcome its highness DogeMiyagi to the meme market podium!\n\nMIYAGI is one of the most recent meme currencies, and it has the potential to become the market leader.\n\nThrough thorough audits, DogeMiyagi proudly emphasises its dedication to identity verification and risk assessment. Its commitment to maintaining a safe environment has won the prestigious Know Your Coin (KYC) accreditation, indicating its commitment to fostering community trust.\n\nDogeMiyagi understands the importance of community involvement and aims to establish an environment that values and benefits all members. DogeMiyagi aspires to stand out in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies with its unique features, attention to security and compliance, and commitment to community trust.\n\nDogeMiyagi:\n\nWebsite: https://dogemiyagi.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogemiyagi_\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/dogemiyagi"

        "content": "Macro Markets, hosted by crypto analyst Marcel Pechman, airs every Friday on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel and explains complex concepts in layperson\u2019s terms, focusing on the cause and effect of traditional financial events on day-to-day crypto activity.\n\nThe latest Macro Markets show discusses the impact of the United States debt crisis as the government quickly runs out of money, a billionaire\u2019s investor alert for an incoming economic bubble burst, and why Walmart\u2019s better-than-expected earnings are a warning sign for investors.\n\nAccording to Pechman, the government has incentives to show desperation and scare the general public into pressuring Congress to approve another increase to the debt ceiling. The risks of a government shutdown and subsequent default exist, which could lead to a wave of bankruptcies and stock market crashes as people rush to liquidate assets for cash.\n\nIn such a \u201cblack swan\u201d scenario, Bitcoin (BTC) could face a 40% to 80% drop in a couple of days, according to Pechman. But there\u2019s a catch: why would investors keep huge cash positions after the dust settles? As soon as the government raises the debt and issues more money, it\u2019s instantly diluted.\n\nNext, Pechman discusses billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller\u2019s warnings of the \u201cbiggest and probably broadest asset bubble.\u201d Stanley believes that what we\u2019re seeing right now in terms of unemployment, delinquency rates and corporate earnings is completely masqueraded by artificially low interest rates.\n\nLastly, Pechman debates Walmart raising its full-year outlook as first-quarter sales top expectations. According to Walmart\u2019s CEO, the consumer discretionary sector is not doing well. The sector\u2019s performance is quite the opposite, with higher incomes moving away from more expensive stores and moving to low-cost retailers.\n\nPechman explains that such news should initially concern Bitcoin and crypto investors since the younger audience is highly relevant to demand. Therefore, as Drukenmiller said, be prepared for unbelievable opportunities ahead.\n\nIf you are looking for exclusive and valuable content provided by leading crypto analysts and experts, make sure to subscribe to the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.

        "content": "Thirteen years after the world\u2019s first Bitcoin (BTC) pizza purchase, the pioneer cryptocurrency network faces a new wave of disruption thanks to the advent of Ordinals, the recently launched protocol that allows adding digital content such as art \u2014 i.e. nonfungible tokens \u2014 in the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSince the launch of Ordinal NFTs on the Bitcoin mainnet in January 2023, the network's traffic has increased significantly, spiking transaction costs and spotlighting issues surrounding Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin mempool, the \u201cwaiting area\u201d for incoming transactions on the network, has over 286,000 pending transactions at the time of writing. While the number is lower than the peak of 400,000 clogged transactions at the beginning of the month, it is still historically high.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph\u2019s Joe Hall during last week\u2019s Bitcoin Builders, Muneeb Ali, the CEO of Trust Machines, explained how Ordinals NFT\u2019s hype could support Bitcoin in attracting more developers and capital to layer-2 solutions.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the largest asset. We should have the best devs, the best scientists trying to work on Bitcoin layer-2s,\u201d said Ali. He believes the fee spike provided clear evidence to developers and investors that layer-2 protocols for Bitcoin are in demand.\n\nRelated: Ordinals good or bad for Bitcoin? Supporters and opposers raise voices\n\nThe purpose of layer-2 solutions is to improve the scalability, privacy, and other characteristics of layer-1 blockchains, such as the Bitcoin network. Ali's Trust Machines is a layer-agnostic ecosystem for Bitcoin applications, building on various layers in the Bitcoin network.\n\nTotal number of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain in the past 12 months. Source: Blockchain.com\n\nThere is a $500 billion market potential untapped on the BTC network, claims Ali, referring to BTC\u2019s current market capitalization of $521 billion. Products, users and the amount of Bitcoin sent on the Lightning Network (LN), the layer-2 payment solution built on top of its blockchain, has skyrocketed in 2023. Despite the figures, the Bitcoin space continues to struggle for developers, and there are no entities \u201cplaying the game,\u201d explained Ali.\n\nBitcoin, the CEO says, is \u201cso decent,\u201d a benefit that can still hinder the development of a solid developer ecosystem. \u201cThere is no marketing department, there is no foundation, there\u2019s no incentive. That\u2019s why it is grassroots decentralized and most decentralized driven.\u201d\n\nIncreasing Bitcoin fees may attract more developers, but won\u2019t unlock its global potential if layer-2 solutions don\u2019t gain traction as a category for venture capitalists, defends Ali. \u201cIf collectively, Bitcoin layer-2s emerge as a very attractive category, and there\u2019s better education around why it is interesting, it is a narrative as well. I think the community can have a very grassroots narrative, and there\u2019s a ton of support for Bitcoin out there.\u201d\n\nMagazine: Ordinals turned Bitcoin into a worse version of Ethereum \u2014 Can we fix it?"

During the Bitcoin 2023 conference held in Miami, Florida, Marathon said they will match donations to the non-profit Bitcoin research and development firm Brink, up to $500,000 on a two-for-one basis. Following the conference, Marathon will continue to match additional donations on a one-for-one basis until December 31. These contributions will be used to fund grants and programs that financially support Bitcoin Core developers, ensuring the continuous improvement of the world's dominant blockchain. Marathon CEO Fred Thiel emphasized the importance of compensating these developers, who often rely on grants to sustain their work, and expressed his desire to engage other industry partners in supporting this vital ecosystem.\n\nThe recent market downturn in the crypto industry, known as the \"crypto winter,\" had raised concerns about funding for Bitcoin development. However, Marathon's generous pledge, which may reach $1 million with third-party donations, demonstrates the company's commitment to bolstering the Bitcoin funding landscape. Thiel highlighted the reliance of developers on their personal resources and the necessity of grants, such as those provided by Brink, to ensure their financial stability. Brink, founded in 2020, supports Bitcoin protocol development through its fellowship mentor program and developer grant program. Thiel and Brink's co-founder and executive director, Mike Schmidt, jointly announced this initiative during the conference, garnering significant support."

Source: CoinGlass\n\nPCE data forms week\u2019s macro highlight\n\nMacro triggers are set to increase somewhat this week, as May 26 sees a slew of economic data, including the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index.\n\nThis is a key component for the Fed regarding interest rate policy, and its readings can instantly reshape market expectations for rate changes.\n\nThat was the case during Powell\u2019s speech last week, with the odds of a rate hike pause increasing from 60% to 80%.\n\nAs of May 22, those odds remain high at around 86%, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, with the next decision on policy not due for another three weeks.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart. Source: CME Group\n\nThe disparity between market expectations and the conservative language of the Fed thus remains a key phenomenon, one which Powell himself addressed last week.\n\nThe phenomenon, he said, \u201cappears to reflect simply a different forecast, one in which inflation comes down much more quickly,\u201d adding that there was no such guarantee of this.\n\n\u201cWhile we do not have a report on PCE inflation for April yet, another inflation measure, the core component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), showed little further improvement in April,\u201d comments from Fed board member Philip Jefferson at the 2023 International Insurance Forum in Washington, D.C. on May 18 stated in a similarly risk-off tone.\n\nBeyond that, May 24 will see the release of the minutes from this month\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, at which the most recent rate hike was decided. Markets will scrutinize the exact language employed by Fed members during that event.\n\nA separate debate concerns the U.S. debt ceiling debacle, with talks remaining deadlocked last week.\n\nShort-term BTC holder profits trend toward reset\n\nIt\u2019s consolidation time for the BTC supply, with on-chain data showing a lack of movement compared to recent months.\n\nAccording to the figures from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the portion of the supply last active within the previous three to six months is now at three-month lows.\n\nCorresponding to the period from December 2022 to February 2023, this suggests hodlers sitting on their hands as last year\u2019s bear market fizzled to produce the start of Bitcoin\u2019s 70% Q1 gains.\n\nContrasting that is the supply last active one to three months ago, now at three-month highs and covering the portion of price action, which includes the $31,000 local highs from April.\n\nAt the same time, the effects of the subsequent comedown can be seen in hodlers\u2019 unrealized profit, now at its lowest levels in a month.\n\nBitcoin relative unrealized profit chart. Source: Glassnode/ Twitter\n\nThat latter figure could yet preclude a reset in expectations of Bitcoin speculators, classified as short-term holders (STHs) with positions three months old or less. Drifting downward, BTC/USD is slowly approaching their current average cost basis.\n\nEarlier in May, Glassnode noted that such a \u201creset\u201d in profitability tends to offer significant price support.\n\nResearch into the STH market value to realized value (MVRV) metric, then at 1.15, nonetheless warned a reset might require a dip below $25,000.\n\n\u201cShould a deeper market correction develop, a price of $24.4K level would bring a STH-MVRV back to a break-even value of 1.0, which has shown to be a point of support in up-trending markets,\u201d it stated.\n\nSTH-MVRV measured 1.047 as of May 21, the latest date for which data is currently available.\n\nBitcoin STH-MVRV chart.

Furthermore, on a broader scale, all market players managed to realize profits exceeding 7% on average,\u201d it commented on market participants as a whole.\n\nOn whales, CryptoQuant referenced the exchange whale ratio metric, which tracks the size ratio of the top ten exchange inflow transactions relative to the total.\n\n\u201cThis downturn is also influenced by whales taking the lead in depositing Bitcoin into exchanges, as evidenced by the early May surge in the Exchange Whale Ratio. Without a doubt, Bitcoin transactions by these whales escalated to fairly high levels, with transfers involving more than 40% of the coins,\u201d it continued.\n\nBitcoin exchange whale ratio annotated chart (screenshot). Source: CryptoQuant\n\nIn terms of support, the research nonetheless acknowledged that whales\u2019 overall impact on the market is \u201clessening\u201d as time goes by.\n\nSTHs, on the other hand, were responsible for protecting the $26,500, which was subsequently held as support over the weekend.\n\n\u201cInvestors who have held Bitcoin for 1 to 3 months show a significant support level in their cost basis ($26.5K), indicating that this was a key point during the recent price correction,\u201d it added.\n\nCrypto market fear on the up\n\nAside from on-chain data, social signals suggest that the average crypto market participant is becoming afraid.\n\nRelated: These four altcoins could be ready for an up-move if Bitcoin rallies above $27,500\n\nThe Crypto Fear & Greed Index matched two-month lows at the end of last week, now below the 50 midpoint and markedly unlike its composition at April\u2019s $31,000 local BTC price highs.\n\nCrypto Fear & Greed Index (screenshot). Source: Alternative.me\n\nExpectations thus seem skewed toward conditions worsening for markets; and while broadly \u201cneutral,\u201d Fear & Greed is not the only source showing traders\u2019 doom and gloom.\n\n\u201cWith Bitcoin revisiting the $26k level, traders are showing increased worries of prices falling back to the $20k to $25k range,\u201d research firm Santiment added on May 19.\n\n\u201c$BTC social dominance has jumped high again, typically a sign of fear. Fear signals increase the probability of a rebound.\u201d\n\nBitcoin social activity data.

        "title": "Is Monero Better than Bitcoin? How Will Big Eyes Coin Change the Equation? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Is Monero better than Bitcoin? It is a question that has been asked since it was discovered that Moner mining can be much easier and more rewarding than Bitcoin.\n\nAnd this week Monero (XMR) has tested the truth of that assumption. As it displayed relatively uncommon stability, does that mean that Monero will surpass Bitcoin?\n\nAnother question that people have been asking for a while is \u201cWhat is the next big thing in crypto?\u201d and we might be closer to the answers than we know. Big Eyes Coin (BIG) ends its presale on June 3rd and celebrates that by offering tokens at a vastly discounted price for the remainder of the presale.\n\nMonero Rises 0.47%: Is It Better Than Bitcoin?\n\nBig Eyes Coin About To Pounce On The Market\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Price Fluctuates\n\nMonero Rises 0.47%: Is it Better than Bitcoin?\n\nMonero (XMR) became famous for providing private transactions to its users, and for being easier to mine than Bitcoin or Ethereum. By using an algorithm that enables Monero mining on a relatively less-advantaged computer, it has prompted some to ask: is Monero better than Bitcoin?\n\nMonero\u2019s XMR has exhibited relatively low volatility compared to the overall cryptocurrency market. On Monday, it saw a modest increase of 0.47% to reach $153.8. InvestorsObserver assigns Monero a Volatility Rank of 14, indicating its low volatility compared to other cryptocurrencies. This places Monero in the bottom 14% of cryptos in terms of volatility.\n\nThe low volatility ranking suggests that Monero\u2019s price experiences narrower swings and is less susceptible to manipulation. Currently, Monero\u2019s price is trading near resistance levels, with support at around $152.44 and resistance at approximately $153.94. This may indicate potential selling pressures ahead as the coin may be reaching an overextended state.\n\nBig Eyes Coin About To Pounce On The Market\n\nBig Eyes Coin\u2019s community has carried it through 13 stages of presale, and now the end is almost upon us, as the end of the presale has been given a date; June 3rd. The official launch will follow soon after on June 15th, but for the remainder of this final month, the presale price will be cut down to $0.00017 which was the price during stage 3.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy selling its token at a fraction of a cent, Big Eyes Coin has confirmed its dedication to its community and its gratitude for its support. Now, we can look forward to the launch of BIG\u2019s casino and its NFT collection.\n\nThe Casino will allow holders to play P2E games using their $BIG as currency and betting chips. And the NFT collection will act as an owners\u2019 club by providing members with exclusive events, content, and opportunities.\n\nBig Eyes Coin has announced that it will allocate 5% of its token supply to a charity wallet dedicated to donating to charities that are saving the oceans, forests, and animals.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Price Fluctuates\n\nBitcoin (BTC) recently broke the $27,200 level, sparking speculation about its future price. Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones expressed concerns about Bitcoin\u2019s regulatory challenges and diminished positive outlook due to lower inflation expectations. CoinShares reported four weeks of outflows from crypto investment funds, primarily in Bitcoin-related products, indicating negative sentiment.\n\nThe US dollar gained traction ahead of the US Debt Ceiling Talks and the release of retail sales data. Bitcoin\u2019s technical indicators suggest a potential bullish rebound if it maintains support above $26,800, targeting $27,800 or $27,500.\n\nThe answer to the first question we asked was \u201cIs Monero better than Bitcoin?\u201d may not be so easy to agree upon, and neither is the answer to the second question \u201cWhat is the next big thing in crypto?\u201d but we can make educated guesses on both of them.\n\nMonero mining does not require much computational power which has helped raise its price significantly. And with the end of Big Eyes Coin\u2019s presale, things in the crypto world might soon change, since we will be finally able to witness its potential in effect.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/BigEyesCoin/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin"

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price on the remembrance inched closer to 2022\u2019s value.\n\nThe coin might face rejection or break out due to the tight trading range.\n\nEvery 22 May marks Bitcoin [BTC] pizza day. And this year, the king coin price floated around $26,850, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The event is an annual celebration to mark the first commercial use of the digital asset in a transaction.\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nAlthough this year is the thirteenth commemoration, the incident happened in 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer, exchanged 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. During this period, the coin\u2019s worth was less than a penny.\n\nInterestingly, the BTC price on the same day in 2022 was closer to the price this time, especially as it occurred at a time when the broader market was suffering the consequences of the Terra Luna [LUNA] and Terra [UST] crash. So, what could happen to BTC\u2019s value this time?\n\nMake or mar season\n\nAccording to Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, BTC\u2019s classy choppy pattern could either help it race beyond $27,200 or face a rejection around the same area.\n\nClassic choppy pattern on #Bitcoin. Rejects at $27,200 and consolidates, as CME gap is also around $26,900.#Bitcoin needs to break and flip $27,200 if we want to see any sustained momentum. Beneath us, at around $26,000-26,500 -> 200-Week MA. pic.twitter.com/4rvuHLyjxe \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) May 21, 2023\n\nA choppy pattern occurs when bulls (buyers) and bears (sellers) are roughly even when it comes to control. Here, the asset value is often linked with volatile periods and rectangular patterns. This makes it extremely difficult to trade.\n\nBefore his recent opinion, the technical analysis specialist had also referred to BTC\u2019s historical performance. Like the aforementioned point, he considered the 200-day Moving Average (MA), noting that it could be a \u201cmake or break\u201d week for BTC. Poppe said,\n\n\u201cIf you go back in history, the 200-MA retest is a great period to accumulate. In the past 6 months, Bitcoin has been swimming beneath for a long period, making it the most undervalued since existence. Next week is make-or-break. Fast breakout upwards -> end of correction.\u201d\n\nOf the rise and increased adoption\n\nHowever, there have been some positive happenings in BTC since the last Pizza Day. According to Santiment, the total number of holders one year ago was 42.08 million.\n\nAt press time, the same metric was 47.6 million. The increase in the number of holders means that BTC adoption has improved despite the series of capitulations within the period.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nWhen it comes to the transaction count, it was also a similar case. As expected, this transaction count has been unsteady. The metric was 479,000 \u2014 almost double the number it was the previous year. The hike implied that many addresses were now optimistic about trading the underlying coin.\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin Pizza Day does not only represent a time to look at the above event, but it also reflects a season to explore the coin growth over the years."

Discover SCENE\n\nMichael Saylor, MicroStrategy co-founder and executive chairman, has become one of the few Bitcoin maximalists to publicly embrace Ordinals.\n\nOrdinal inscriptions are similar to NFTs, which primarily exist on rival network Ethereum. Inscriptions allow for arbitrary and non-financial information, such as images, to be included on the Bitcoin blockchain. Short for \"Bitcoin Request for Comment,\" BRC-20 is an experimental framework for building fungible tokens on Bitcoin using the Ordinals protocol.\n\nOver the past couple weeks though, Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens have taken center stage as transaction fees skyrocketed. It has kicked off many discussions within the Bitcoin community over whether the network was being attacked and if these transactions should be censored.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSaylor chatted with Decrypt at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami last week about Ordinals, BRC-20 inscriptions, and whether they might constitute unregistered securities.\n\nSaylor has embraced Ordinals as a positive development on the Bitcoin network, although he said many of the early use cases \"aren't terribly serious\" and veer towards being more speculative.\n\nOne of the top performing Bitcoin Ordinals collections has been Bitcoin Frogs, according to CryptoSlam. It's a spin off of the Pepe the Frog meme coin craze that's taken the NFT community by storm.\n\n\"If BRC-20 tokens are viewed as fungible tokens to issue unregistered securities, there's a lot of objection to that, because it's unethical. It's illegal. And you can't blame [the community] for objecting to that,\" Saylor said.\n\nHowever, if they are issued and regulated in an ethical and legal manner, he said, there\u2019s no issue.

        "content": "MPs in the United Kingdom are looking to establish more regulations around cryptocurrency trading. The Treasury Committee has released a report, stating crypto should be regulated as gambling, recommending that the UK Government regulate unbacked cryptoasset activities.\n\nThis subject remains relevant against the current backdrop of financial inclusion, where Crypto regulations could impact its accessibility. Currently, the only regulations for cryptocurrency are set around anti-money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorism funding. However, some MPs across the Government are calling for greater rules to be put in place, such as financial services trading regulations being assigned to crypto, or even gambling regulations.\n\nHarriett Baldwin MP: \u201cEffective regulation is clearly needed\u201d\n\nCommenting on the report, Harriett Baldwin MP, Chair of the Treasury Committee, says: \u201cThe events of 2022 have highlighted the risks posed to consumers by the cryptoasset industry, large parts of which remain a wild west. Effective regulation is clearly needed to protect consumers from harm, as well as to support productive innovation in the UK\u2019s financial services industry.\u201d\n\nThe report itself states that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, for instance, have \u2018no intrinsic value\u2019 and \u2018serve no useful social purpose\u2019, whilst being used by criminals in scams, fraud and money laundering.\n\nConcerns were also raised for regulating consumer crypto trading as a financial service, which MPs say will create a so-called \u2018halo effect\u2019 - ultimately leading consumers to believe that it is a safe and protected activity when MPs do not think it is.\n\nCurrently, around 10% of UK adults hold or have helo cryptoassets, according to HM Revenue & Customs.\n\nCryptoUK speaks out against gambling comparison\n\nJonathan Millet, a Business Consultant at NewsBTC, shared his insight on the proposed regulations, saying; \u201cbecause tangible currencies or assets do not back cryptocurrencies, the market has the potential to be volatile and, along with substantial financial gains, they too come with the risk of substantial financial losses.\n\n\u201cMPs and UK lawmakers fear if the same regulations as financial services are applied, a false sense of security around the level of risk involved is created.\u201d\n\nMillet also says that CryptoUK, the self-regulatory crypto trading association, has spoken out in strong disagreement about the comparison between gambling and crypto trading.\n\n\u201cThe association has taken Umbridge to the claims of the Treasury Select Committee, saying they are harmful, false and unfounded.\u201d\n\nAccording to Millet, professional investment managers see Bitcoin, as well as other crypto assets, as a new alternative investment strategy and not as a form of gambling. His belief is that crypto trading has plenty to offer the financial trading and services sector.\n\n\u201cMany of these benefits are not openly discussed and include quicker settlement times, automation of contracts through AI, cost reductions through relevant intermediary services and enhanced liquidity.\"\n\n\u201cBetter collaboration is needed [with] the UK government\u201d\n\nMillet continued: \u201cConsumer risks, of course, exist, and these should be mitigated through education awareness and a more robust framework giving clarity on the regulatory landscape in which they operate.\u201d\n\nThis would involve dedicated sources of information surrounding the risks involved in consumer crypto trading, which Millet believes should be widespread and on openly available platforms.\n\n\u201cBetter collaboration is needed between CryptoUK, and the UK Government to increase education and elevate consumer awareness through campaigning and advertising,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe believe creating bespoke regulatory frameworks, tailored to suit constant industry changes and developments will ensure the FCA is positioned to give the best duty of care to all individuals.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Nick Jones, Co-Founder and CEO of Zumo has spoken out against the Treasury Committee\u2019s report, stating: \u201cWhat an appalling backward step this would be.\u201d\n\nJones continues: \u201cThe UK should be looking to encourage alternative financial solutions, not discouraging them by likening them to gambling. A truly resilient future financial system shouldn\u2019t be resistant to new ideas and structures, rather it should be supportive of them. And it should dare to integrate new ideas where they provide genuine value \u2013 not panic and revert to the perceived safety of failing methods.\u201d\n\n"

        "content": "Crypto Twitter celebrates the 13th anniversary of the famed Bitcoin Pizzas.\n\nThe cost of the first-ever commercial transaction in Bitcoin soared over the years.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) traded below key support of $27,000 since 2 PM GMT Sunday.\n\nAs Bitcoin Pizza Day, the 13th anniversary of the first-ever commercial transaction via Bitcoin (BTC), kicks in, let\u2019s remember how it all started. Laszlo Hanyecz, an American-Hungarian programmer from Florida, attempted to get two large pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins in 2010.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pay 10,000 Bitcoins for a couple of pizzas. Like maybe 2 large ones so I have some leftovers for the next day\u201d, said the unlucky programmer, only to find out later that he paid millions of dollars for the delivery of two XXL pizzas.\n\n13 years ago, Laszlo Hanyecz, a Floridian programmer, bought 2 Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 $BTC. Today, those pizzas would be valued at $267 million.\n\n\n\nHappy #Bitcoin Pizza Day, everyone! \ud83c\udf55 pic.twitter.com/OlJcFfOAG7 \u2014 CoinGecko (@coingecko) May 22, 2023\n\nHow Much Are the Bitcoin Pizzas Worth Now?\n\nDespite the original thread on Bitcointalk.org receiving immediate interest, it was also packed with sarcastic replies. To illustrate, a crowd of members accused Mr. Hanyecz of \u201ctrying to get a free meal,\u201d while others advised selling the 10,000 BTC for $41.\n\nThis plaque resides on the Jacksonville, Florida Papa Johns. pic.twitter.com/yGYLlwCAcl \u2014 Documenting \u20bfitcoin \ud83d\udcc4 (@DocumentingBTC) May 22, 2021\n\nFinally, on 22nd May 2010, the request was fulfilled. One sharp crypto enthusiast from the United Kingdom ordered the delivery on Papa John\u2019s website and ended up with 10,000 BTC.

        "content": "The 10,000 BTC would now be valued at around USD 270 million today, valued at USD 26,833.55. In November 2021, BTC reached an all-time high of USD 68,789, which would have made Hanyecz worth around $690 million had he not ordered the infamous pizzas\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nYou're reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\n\nThe curious case of a Floridian programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz and his purchase of two pizzas worth 10,000 Bitcoin in 2010 precisely tells you about the true volatile nature of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nOn May 18, 2010, Hanyecz took to the Bitcointalk.org forum to announce his decision to pay 10,000 BTC to anyone willing to place an order of two pizzas, preferably two large pies for him. No one took his offer until May 22, when 19-year-old Jeremy Sturdivant accepted his offer.\n\nThe two large-size Papa John's pizzas were delivered to Hanyecz's place in Florida and cost USD 41 then. Hanyecz took to the forum to share the image of the pizzas along with his family.\n\nVia Twitter\n\nThe 10,000 BTC would now be valued at around USD 270 million today, valued at USD 26,833.55. In November 2021, BTC reached an all-time high of USD 68,789, which would have made Hanyecz worth around $690 million had he not ordered the infamous pizzas.\n\nWhile talking to CBS in 2019, Hanyecz looked back and shared, \"The transaction made [Bitcoin] real for some people. It certainly did for me.\" And today is marked as Bitcoin Pizza Day to celebrate the potential of the then-nascent cryptocurrency.\n\nThe leap of faith\n\nCurrently, there as over 22,000 cryptocurrencies in existence across the world, with BTC being the most valued fiat currency. While there are 235 crypto exchanges existing globally, with Binance being the biggest player.\n\nThe acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrency in 2023 could certainly not have been predicted back in 2010. Banks, corporates, startups, and governments are all embracing the technology and working towards harnessing its full capabilities.\n\nNow, cryptocurrency is the backbone of several emerging industries and ventures. Luxury fashion house Ralph Lauren in April 2023 opened its Miami concept store and partnered with Bitpay to become the first-ever store to accept cryptocurrency. \"Miami is the first of our stores to accept cryptocurrency,\" the brand shared on LinkedIn.\n\nBack in August 2022, Gucci announced it was accepting ApeCoin for purchases at select stores in the United States, \"Now accepting @ApeCoin payments via @BitPay, select Gucci boutiques in the USA expand the range of cryptocurrencies available for in-store purchases, yet another step in the House's exploration of Web3.\"\n\nSome of the big names who are accepting BTC include Microsoft, Burger King, KFC, and Starbucks. Delhi's Ardor 2.1 became the first Indian restaurant to accept cryptocurrency. It was also offering a 20 per cent discount for customers paying via crypto.\n\nIn September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nThe significance\n\nRajagopal Menon, vice-president, WazirX, shared, \"Bitcoin Pizza Day symbolises the remarkable evolution of the Bitcoin and crypto space over the past decade. From the humble purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin to its current total capitalisation of over half a trillion, Bitcoin has come a long way. This transaction heralded the current widespread adoption and showcases the transformative power of cryptos and their emergence as a legitimate asset class in the global financial landscape.\"\n\n\"It is important to note that the real significance lies in the recognition of this transaction as the first real-world use case for Bitcoin, demonstrating its potential as a decentralized digital currency. Bitcoin Pizza Day serves as a reminder of the rapid growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies, highlighting the journey from a seemingly trivial transaction to a global phenomenon. It symbolizes the early believers and pioneers who played a key role in establishing Bitcoin as a viable alternative to traditional financial systems,\" notes Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO, Unocoin.\n\n\"Bitcoin Pizza Day is a testament to the power of community and the growing acceptance of BTC as part of our daily lives,\" said Yi He, co-founder and chief marketing officer, Binance."

        "content": "BTC may have approached the beginning of a bullish run.\n\nThe coin circulation rests in an extremely low region.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s [BTC] failure to recover from its recent decline could be something that long-term investors may not necessarily need to worry about, based on signals from the Pi Cycle Top indicator.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nHistorically, the indicator has been instrumental in picking out market cycles. Furthermore, the metric uses the 111-day Moving Average (MA) and a multiple of the 350-day MA with respect to the Bitcoin Price.\n\nOffering chances that lead to the pinnacle\n\nAccording to LookIntoBitcoin, the 111-day MA was still lower than the 350-day MA. This implies that the current market was far from being overheated since Bitcoin peaks only happened when the former surpassed the latter.\n\nTherefore, it may seem advantageous to accumulate some BTC at the current state. Despite the hope that the Pi Cycle Top Indicator offers, the Bitcoin fear and greed index decreased to 48.\n\nThe index considers volatility, momentum, and market sentiment in determining participant reaction to sudden price action.\n\nIn the first quarter, this index pointed to the greed region. But now that it was neutral and closer to the fear area, it means that investors were not presently excited about the price prospect.\n\nAt press time, BTC\u2019s price was $27,069, a mild 3.83% decrease in the last 30 days. In addressing network profitability, the adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) left the negative region.\n\nThe aSOPR reflects the shift in market sentiment of shrimps and whales\u2019 lifespan while monitoring profitability. With its value above 1.0, the aSOPR showed that there has been a recovery around the 90-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).\n\nTherefore, this means that a wide cross-section of BTC holders leaned toward profitability.\n\nCirculation down\n\nAlthough the aSOPR and Pi Cycle Top indicators displayed bullish potential, BTC might require more input from investors than is currently experienced. For instance, the 365-day circulation had dropped to 5.61 million.\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s BTC\u2019s market cap in ETH terms\n\nCirculation shows the number of unique coins engaged in transactions within a specific period. As of January, circulation was as high as 6.05 million. Hence, the decline means that investors were shying away from exchanging BTC between addresses.\n\nMeanwhile, the daily active addresses have revived from the severe decrease on 7 May. As of 20 May, the metric has moved to 737,000.\n\nThis meant that there was a considerable level of crowd depositing and receiving BTC based on the market. Thus, increasing the level of interaction with the coin."

        "content": "In another move to showcase his support for cryptocurrencies, Republican Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy became the second candidate in US Presidential elections in 2024 to accept donations through Bitcoin. Vivek Ramaswamy made the announcement during the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami and also urged his supporters to \"make the 2024 election a referendum on fiat currency.\"\n\nVivek Ramaswamy is the second candidate to allow donations through Bitcoin and before him, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also made a similar move that reflects the influence of Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies and the transformation the future of finance is going to witness.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy displayed a QR code during his speech, which links his supporters with a payment gateway with various donation options including Bitcoin and satoshis. The citizens and permanent residents of the US, who are eligible to vote can donate up to $6,600 to Vivek Ramaswamy's campaign and as a token of appreciation can receive a nonfungible token (NFT).\n\nHe clarified that he does not plan to issue any NFT for personal profits or campaign fundraising and is just giving an option to US voters to make their donation in the form of Bitcoin. Vivek Ramaswamy emphasized that he is not threatened by the rise of digital currencies.\n\nFreedom to mine Bitcoin\n\nVivek Ramaswamy stressed the freedom to mine Bitcoin in the US as the country recently surpassed China to become the global hub for mining activities. But, US President Joe Biden proposed a 30% tax on electricity used by cryptocurrency mining operations. Vivek Ramaswamy has opposed this tax calling it wrong, unfair, and an inappropriate exercise of federal power.\n\nAt the Bitcoin Conference 2023, Vivek Ramaswamy plans to unveil his Bitcoin policy which allows Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to function as parallel currencies. He believes that this can stabilize the dollar as the unit of measurement and the Federal Reserve mandate to focus on currency stabilization can be restricted.\n\nWith two candidates backing cryptocurrencies', the US Presidential Elections in 2024 will decide a lot of things for Bitcoin-like digital currencies. Currently, the governments of the world are still mulling over how much breathing space they should allow to a parallel currency and the massive dives in the value of Bitcoin-led cryptocurrencies also underlines its volatility.\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "content": "A Dubai-based developer has recently announced ambitious plans to construct the world\u2019s first-ever Bitcoin (BTC) Tower, an innovative project that aims to showcase the importance of digital assets and cryptocurrencies, set to be unveiled at the upcoming COP28 meeting in Dubai on May 24.\n\nThe new hotel chain set to be shaped in the style of Bitcoin is said to not only embrace cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence but also place a strong emphasis on material sustainability and zero CO2 usage, according to a report by EINpresswire on May 21.\n\nThe unique hotel chain takes things a step further by offering non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with special utilities designed to reward its customers. By staking cryptocurrencies, guests will generate an APY that can later be redeemed from their rental payment.\n\nSalvatore Leggiero, the developer behind this visionary undertaking, proudly declares, \u201cIt will be the first hotel that gives you back the money you paid, plus interest.\u201d Such an enticing proposition promises an unforgettable experience for guests while also tapping into the potential financial benefits of cryptocurrencies.\n\nLeggiero elaborates on the genesis of the project, stating:\n\n\u201cEvery great project originates from an idea, develops in the mind, and takes shape on paper, just like Leonardo da Vinci did when he imagined the machines of the future.\u201d\n\nExperiences never imagined before\n\nSeeking inspiration for the virtual representation of the BITCOIN TOWER, Leggiero approached renowned architect Simone Micheli.\n\n\u201cSo, I asked the renowned architect Simone Micheli how the BITCOIN TOWER could be depicted in the virtual universe.\u201d\n\nWith over three decades of experience in completing numerous international projects, Micheli brings a fresh perspective to the table, intending to create virtual environments that unlock previously unimaginable experiences.\n\nA 40-story tower\n\nThe Bitcoin Tower itself is poised to be an awe-inspiring 40-story skyscraper, symbolizing Dubai\u2019s tribute to Bitcoin and encapsulating the principles of its enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Leggiero envisions the tower as a real estate revolution, bridging the gap between digital and physical assets.\n\n\u2018What I propose is a real estate revolution, creating a bridge between digital and physical real estate. BITCOIN TOWER will be the starting point for all those who want to participate in this revolution\u2019, said the CEO.\n\nInviting artists, architects, creatives, and crypto enthusiasts from all corners of the globe, Leggiero, who also serves as the CEO of Metaverse Investments LLC, urges individuals with diverse backgrounds to participate in this groundbreaking endeavor.\n\n\u201cAll those who want to, can submit their works that will form an exclusive collection of NFTs dedicated to the Bitcoin Tower\u2019s design or its internal spaces, in a digital space representing an asset of exceptional tangible value.\u201d\n\nIt will serve as a monumental starting point for those who wish to be a part of this revolution, as expressed by the real estate developer and investor, who operates in Italy, London, and Dubai.\n\nWith its forward-thinking approach, Dubai aims to establish itself as a global hub for cryptocurrency innovation while pushing the boundaries of traditional real estate."

        "content": "Every year, people across the globe celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day on May 22. This day is important among crypto enthusiasts as Bitcoin, the world's oldest and most valued crypto, was used for the first time to purchase a real-world product. Cryptocurrency fans call it \u2018Bitcoin Pizza Day\u2019 as Floridian programmer Laszlo Hanyecz had paid 10,000 Bitcoins to have two Papa John's pizzas delivered to him on May 22, 2010. Simply put, pizza was the first real-world item to be bought using Bitcoin. In this explainer, let us try to understand its history and significance, and also take a quick look at what industry experts have to say on this.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day: History\n\nThe first instance of Bitcoin halving took place in 2012 and just after that, on May 18 that year, Hanyecz announced on the Bitcointalk.org forum that he wished to purchase two large pizzas using Bitcoins. He announced offering 10,000 Bitcoins to anyone who was willing to order, collect, and deliver them to him personally.\n\nThe pizzas did get delivered to him, however, the identity of the person who accepted Hanyecz's remained a secret for a long time. Later on, it was found that 19-year-old Jeremy Sturdivant was the one who accepted the order, purchased the pizzas from Papa John's and got them delivered to Hanyecz.\n\nDuring a 2019 interview with CBS, Hanyecz said, \u201cThe transaction made [Bitcoin] real for some people. It certainly did for me.\"\n\nTo honour the day, the global crypto community commemorates May 22 each year as 'Bitcoin Pizza Day'.\n\nHow Much Could The Two Pizzas Be Worth Today?\n\nBack on May 22, 2010, the two pizzas were worth 10,000 Bitcoins, or roughly at around $41. Notably, the value of the two pizzas increased to a whopping $2.4 million in 2015, and eventually, the price of each Bitcoin reached around $63,000 per token in 2021. If we consider that, those two Papa John's pizzas are today worth around $630 million.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day: Reactions From Crypto Community\n\nMudrex CEO and co-founder Edul Patel told ABP Live, \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day symbolises the incredible journey of cryptocurrencies, from a humble transaction to a global phenomenon. It reminds us of the immense growth potential and transformative power of digital assets in shaping the future of finance.\u201d\n\nAshish Singhal, the CEO and co-founder of CoinSwitch, said, \u201cOn this day in 2010, Bitcoin made its inaugural practical use, establishing a model for subsequent applications of crypto. Prior to this incident, the concept of crypto existed purely in theory, lacking any proof of its capacity to facilitate real-world purchases. Nevertheless, Hanyecz\u2019s decision to exchange 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas provided concrete evidence of crypto\u2019s potential as a medium of trade.\u201d\n\nWazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day commemorates the momentous purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoin. This single transaction transformed Bitcoin from 'magic Internet money' to something that has value. It is a yearly reminder of the transformative power and unforeseen implications of blockchain technology.\u201d\n\nSathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO, Unocoin, said, \"It is important to note that the real significance lies in the recognition of this transaction as the first real-world use case for Bitcoin, demonstrating its potential as a decentralized digital currency. Bitcoin Pizza Day serves as a reminder of the rapid growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies, highlighting the journey from a seemingly trivial transaction to a global phenomenon.

CTO Paolo Ardoino added that the integration will ensure greater financial inclusion as Strike recently expanded to 65 additional countries.\n\nThe Strike mobile payments app was only available in a handful of countries like the U.S. and El Salvador.\n\nBy combining the stability and utility of Tether\u2019s digital currency with Strike\u2019s innovative payment solutions, users will experience a new era of secure and efficient transactions. This collaboration signifies a significant leap toward mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, as it addresses several key challenges faced by the industry.\n\nTether\u2019s Bitcoin Bag\n\nThe Strike integration comes on the back of the company\u2019s Bitcoin accumulation strategy for its stablecoin reserves. At the end of Q1 2023 in March, Tether\u2019s quarterly attestation revealed that the company held a massive $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, along with other assets like Gold and short-term treasury bills.\n\nIn addition, Tether said it would start buying more Bitcoin starting in May. The company will allocate 15% of net realized operating profits toward strengthening its BTC reserve. The extra Bitcoin will serve as an extra cushion to USDT\u2019s reserves that the payments company claims are 100% backed."

Here, however, Glassnode has taken a different approach that provides a new perspective on these rallies.\n\nThe comparison basis between the price surges here is the drawdowns that each of them experienced across their spans. Note that these drawdowns aren\u2019t to be confused with the cyclical drawdowns that are used to measure how the price has declined since the bull run top.\n\nThe drawdowns in question are the obstacles that the cryptocurrency encountered while the rallies were still ongoing, and are hence, those that the coin eventually managed to overcome.\n\nHere is a chart that shows the degree of drawdowns that each of the historical bull markets experienced, and also where the current rally stands in comparison to them:\n\nLooks like the value of the metric hasn't been too high for the latest rally so far | Source: Glassnode on Twitter\n\nThe five bull rallies here are as follows: genesis to 2011 (the very first rally), 2011-2013, 2015-2017, 2018-2021 (the last rally), and 2022 cycle+ (the ongoing one).\n\nThe analytics firm here has taken the bottom of each of the bear markets as the start of the next bull rallies. This means that parts of the cycle that some may not consider as part of the proper bull run are also included.\n\nThe main example of this would be the April 2019 rally, which is often considered its own thing but is clubbed with the last Bitcoin bull market in the above chart.\n\nFrom the graph, it\u2019s visible that the deepest drawdown that occurred during the first bull market measured around -49.4%. The next run, the 2011 to 2013 bull, experienced an even larger obstacle of a -71.2% plunge midway through it.\n\nThe next one (2015-2017) then only saw a drawdown of -36%, but the drawdown was again up at -62.6% for the run that followed it (that is, the latest bull market).\n\nSo far in the 2022+ Bitcoin bull market (which would only be considered a bull market at all if the November 2022 low was truly the cyclical bottom), the deepest drawdown observed so far is the March 2023 plunge of -18.6%.\n\nClearly, the drawdown seen in the current rally so far is significantly lesser than what the historical bull markets face. If the pattern of the past runs holds any weight at all, then this would mean that the current bull market should still have more potential to grow.\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,900, down 2% in the last week.\n\nBTC has been moving sideways recently | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from iStock.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Just a few months into her divorce proceedings, a US woman thought it was suspicious that her spouse, who earned $3 million annually, didn\u2019t have many assets.\n\nAfter spending half a year on discovery and enlisting the help of a forensic accountant, the housewife eventually tracked down 12 bitcoins \u2014 then worth half a million dollars ($500,000) \u2014 in a previously undisclosed crypto wallet of her husband's.\n\n\n\nUS Women Finds Out About Husband's Hidden Bitcoins\n\ngoldmanlaw303\n\nSarita (name changed to maintain anonymity), who was married for a decade, said she felt blindsided by her husband\u2019s cryptocurrency investment, as per CNBC.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know of bitcoin and things like that. I just didn\u2019t know much about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was never even a thought in my mind, because it\u2019s not like we were discussing it or making investments together. ... It was definitely a shock.\u201d\n\nThe world of financial infidelity has become increasingly sophisticated, as investors \u201chop\u201d coins across blockchains and sink their cash into metaverse properties. An NBC News poll found that 1 in 5 Americans have invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, with men between the ages of 18 and 49 accounting for the highest share of all demographic groups.\n\nMost divorce attorneys from Florida, New York, Texas and California, blockchain forensic investigators, financial advisors, as well as spouses who were either hunting down virtual coins or the crypto holders themselves, agree that the law can\u2019t keep up with all the new ways that people earn and safeguard digital assets that largely exist outside the reach of centralized intermediaries such as banks.\n\nAlso Read: US Man Pays 10,000 Bitcoins For Pizza\n\nAnother Divorcing Couple Fought Over Crypto\n\nshutterstock\n\nLast year, news came out regarding a wealthy San Francisco couple fighting not just for children, profits from the sale of the husband\u2019s software company and their $3.6 million home, but also for cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nErica and Francis deSouza's most fierce court battle concerned a bitter dispute over millions of dollars in missing Bitcoin. The husband had bought a little over 1,000 Bitcoins before he separated from his wife in 2013 and then lost nearly half the funds when a prominent cryptocurrency exchange collapsed, as per a New York Times report. After three years of litigation, a San Francisco appeals court ruled in 2020 that Mr. deSouza had failed to properly disclose some elements of his cryptocurrency investments, which had exploded in value. The court ordered him to give Ms. deSouza more than $6 million of his remaining Bitcoin.\n\nIn recent years, divorces, especially in the US, are turning ugly due to crypto's involvement. But it is the difficulty in tracking and valuing cryptocurrency that is creating new headaches in the legal world.\n\nAlso Read: 'Bam Bam Bitcoin Beach' In Portugal\n\nFor the latest and more interesting financial news, keep reading Indiatimes Worth.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) shrimp investors, affectionately dubbed the \u201cunderdogs\u201d of the cryptocurrency world, are making waves in the market as they steadily accumulate the digital asset at an unprecedented rate.\n\nThese smaller investors, often overlooked in favor of institutional giants, have recently reached a significant milestone, with the total supply of Bitcoin held by them surging to an all-time high of 1.31 million coins.\n\nThis surge not only highlights the growing influence of retail investors in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies but also underscores their determination to ride the Bitcoin wave alongside their more affluent counterparts.\n\nThe Rise Of Bitcoin Shrimp Investors\n\nAccording to data analytics firm Glassnode, these shrimp investors have surged to an all-time high (ATH) of 1.31 million coins. The continuous rise in their holdings highlights their growing influence and raises intriguing questions about the evolving dynamics within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nThe #Bitcoin supply held by Shrimp Entities (<1 BTC) continues to relentlessly rise, expanding to an ATH of 1.31M coins. The cohort is currently experiencing a significant expansion of +26K coins per month, with only 202 (3.9%) trading days recording a larger monthly growth. pic.twitter.com/Fa2QCHxZPO \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) May 18, 2023\n\nThe data further reveals that shrimp investors are adding an average of approximately 26,000 Bitcoins to their cumulative holdings each month. This significant expansion is worth noting, considering that only 3.9% of trading days, equivalent to 202 days, have witnessed a larger monthly growth rate.\n\nThese statistics underline the sustained interest in Bitcoin among retail investors, who remain undeterred by its well-known price volatility.\n\nThe Shrimp Investor Effect On BTC Price Dynamics\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price, as reported by CoinGecko, currently stands at $26,914, reflecting a slight 1.1% decline over the past 24 hours, while the cryptocurrency was up 1.4% over the last seven days.\n\nSource: Coingecko\n\nThe surge in shrimp investors, indicated by their increasing accumulation of Bitcoin, can have multiple impacts on the current price of BTC.\n\nThe sustained interest and continuous buying pressure from shrimp investors can contribute to upward price momentum. As more retail investors enter the market and acquire Bitcoin, the increased demand can drive the price higher.\n\nThis influx of buyers, particularly if they are accumulating the cryptocurrency at an unprecedented rate, as mentioned earlier, can create a bullish sentiment that attracts further investors and potentially leads to price appreciation.\n\nBTCUSD backpedals to the $26K level. Chart: TradingView.com\n\nConversely, the impact of shrimp investors on the price of BTC can be influenced by market dynamics and investor sentiment. While their accumulation may indicate growing interest, the overall sentiment in the market, including the actions of larger institutional investors or regulatory developments, can also influence the price.\n\nIf negative news or a general bearish sentiment prevails, it can offset the impact of shrimp investors and result in a more stagnant or declining price.\n\n-Featured image from DELAYNA EARLEY / THE ISLAND PACKET VIA AP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Is the Ethereum Network Too Slow for it to Surpass Bitcoin? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In the world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Bitcoin stand out as the two biggest players and rightly so. With Bitcoin establishing itself as the main player for many in the cryptocurrency space, some commentators are giving their full backing to Ethereum to take the Bitcoin crown as Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities and expansive ecosystem, has gained significant traction. However, concerns have been raised about scalability and transaction speed, raising the question of whether the Ethereum network is too slow to surpass Bitcoin and reach that top spot. With major developments on the horizon for the Ethereum network the signs are positive for the future, but will they make the difference that is needed? In this article we look at some of the facts in the Ethereum vs Bitcoin debate and let you make up your own mind.\n\nIs the Ethereum Network Really Slow?\n\nOne of the biggest pointers against Ethereum\u2019s speed is its ability to handle large amounts of traffic on the network. As Ethereum gained popularity at the same time as all of the crypto space did, its network became increasingly clogged. And without the right infrastructure in place, this led to higher transaction fees and longer confirmation times slowing down processes for users. During peak periods, such as when popular applications are hammered by heavy usage or during token launches or sales, network congestion can significantly impact transaction speed. This can happen with new token sales or when a certain coin or token experiences a surge in price \u2013 either up or down. Users can keep an eye on coin prices like the Loopring Price to understand these movements and also keep an eye on gas fees and all the latest news in the crypto space to make an educated decision on how to invest or which network to use.\n\nSome lay the blame for the drag on speed at the feet of Ethereum\u2019s current consensus mechanism, otherwise called the Proof of Work, which requires substantial computational resources, leading to slower block validation times. If we look at Bitcoin in comparison, Bitcoin\u2019s Proof of Work algorithm is optimized for security and has a longer average block time, making it less prone to network congestion during high transaction periods. Gas fees can be high and unpredictable, which is a significant issue for Ethereum users. Network congestion can also slow down the network and increase gas fees.\n\nThe good news however is that Ethereum is actively working on ways to improve scalability. The biggest development is clearly the introduction of Ethereum 2.0 and Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network. Additionally, Ethereum switched from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, which, due to the practicalities of the practice, takes far less energy from technology or man. Warehouses full of servers were retired and as a result, the Ethereum coin is gaining speed.\n\nThese developments are still in progress though and until these solutions are fully implemented, Ethereum\u2019s transaction speed may continue to be dragged down. Ethereum 2.0 is being released in phases and while there are still some questions on the effectiveness of the upgrade, many point to this watershed moment as the reason for Ethereum\u2019s potential to surpass Bitcoin. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade will change the consensus mechanism for Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism with the goal of reducing the amount of computational resources. Shard chains are one of the biggest changes to the 2.0 upgrade that will hopefully have the biggest impact on the network overall.\n\nEthereum\u2019s Growing Ecosystem Drives Innovation\n\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s main strengths is its fantastic ecosystem of applications and smart contracts. This highly developed ecosystem attracts developers and users, fostering innovation and driving adoption. As Ethereum continues to evolve, the demand for its network may increase, spurring the development of scalability solutions and potentially enhancing transaction speeds. With such an active development initiative, the Ethereum community has a vibrant and active developer base constantly working towards improving the network\u2019s performance in the race to beat Bitcoin. This community of developers are dedicated to optimizing the Ethereum blockchain, creating layer 2 solutions, and exploring innovative scaling techniques. Their ongoing efforts indicate a commitment to overcoming the network\u2019s current limitations and enhancing transaction speed.\n\nFlexible for The Future\n\nAlthough there are issues, the good news is that Ethereum\u2019s design allows for easier upgrades compared to Bitcoin. This flexibility for future development provides the potential to bring on new ways of working and as the network evolves, upgrades can be implemented, which of course have the potential to improve Ethereum\u2019s transaction speed. Align this to the dedication and passion of the development community to improve the Ethereum network and the signs are good for the future. Ethereum 2.0, when it arrives, will usher in a brave new world for crypto and blockchain networks, but will it be enough to let Ethereum take over Bitcoin? That remains to be seen but as the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to grow it will be important for Ethereum to work on its current issues if it is to stand any chance of success.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Bitcoin stand out as the two biggest players and rightly so. With Bitcoin establishing itself as the main player for many in the cryptocurrency space, some commentators are giving their full backing to Ethereum to take the Bitcoin crown as Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities and expansive ecosystem, has gained significant traction. However, concerns have been raised about scalability and transaction speed, raising the question of whether the Ethereum network is too slow to surpass Bitcoin and reach that top spot.

        "content": "Today, May 22nd is Bitcoin Pizza Day. All over the world, enthusiasts and supporters of cryptocurrency Bitcoin are organising events, meetups, and sharing stories and memes to commemorate the first documented real-world transaction using Bitcoin.\n\nOn May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer from Florida, made history by successfully completing a transaction in which he purchased two Papa John\u2019s pizzas for 10,000 BTC.\n\nHe reportedly posted a message on the Bitcointalk forum, a popular online Bitcoin community, offering 10,000 bitcoins in exchange for someone ordering him two pizzas. Eventually, another forum user named \u201cJercos\u201d took him up on the offer and ordered the pizzas from Papa John\u2019s in exchange for the bitcoins. The transaction was completed, and Laszlo received his pizzas, making it the first documented real-world purchase using Bitcoin.\n\nHanyecz\u2019s message on Bitcointalk\n\nAt the time, Bitcoin was in its early stages, and its value was negligible. In fact, Laszlo described it as \u201chaving little value\u201d in his original forum post. However, in hindsight, it is considered one of the most expensive pizza purchases ever made, given the tremendous increase in Bitcoin\u2019s value over the years. Laszlo\u2019s transaction was significant because it demonstrated the use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange for tangible goods and services.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day has since become a symbolic event in the global cryptocurrency community. It serves as a reminder of Bitcoin\u2019s humble beginnings, the evolution of cryptocurrencies and their increasing acceptance in the wider financial world.\n\nHere is a list of ten crypto communities in Africa who are keeping the Bitcoin spirit alive:\n\nCrypto Bootcamp Community has 10,000+ community members across the continent, in cities like Capetown, Kampala, Dubai, Accra, Nairobi, Abuja, and Lagos. It provides education on cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, Web3 with engaging courses and online content.\n\nThe community asserts that its objective is to help people get familiar with blockchain and navigate the industry without any hassle. It also provides marketing, brand promotion and project onboarding services to emerging blockchain and crypto projects. It was founded by Obinna Iwuno in 2020.\n\nWomen in DeFi is a thriving community of DeFi and Blockchain enthusiasts focused on empowering young women in Africa. It provides free education about Blockchain and Crypto to equip women with essential skills and knowledge to take advantage of job opportunities in the field of blockchain technology.\n\nBitcoin Ekasi is a community in South Africa dedicated to establishing a Bitcoin-based economy. It operates as an extension of The Surfer Kids Non-Profit, a non-profit organization focused on empowering children through surfing education. By paying their surfing coaches in Bitcoin and facilitating crypto payments for local vendors, Bitcoin Ekasi introduces cryptocurrency transactions into the town\u2019s economic framework.\n\nAfrican Bitcoiners is a community dedicated to assisting African individuals in their journey with Bitcoin. They aim to educate and onboard new users, ensuring their safe navigation through various stages, from learning about Bitcoin to earning and securely storing their accumulated sats (bitcoin units). The community strongly believes that Bitcoin is a revolutionary form of currency that promotes fairness and equality, presenting an opportunity to address global wealth inequality and create a more balanced financial landscape.\n\nDigiOats is a community that is supporting Africans to learn, adopt, trade, and securely store digital assets like cryptocurrencies. Their primary objective is to bridge the information gap between Africa and the Western world through comprehensive Digital Financial Literacy initiatives. By promoting education and awareness, DigiOats aims to facilitate the widespread adoption of decentralised innovations, including Bitcoin, throughout Africa.\n\nLed by Anita Posch, Bitcoin for Fairness is a non-profit initiative raising knowledge and understanding of Bitcoin for people in emerging countries and for the disadvantaged. They connect and boost the profile of local stakeholders, and identify and work with educators on the ground to expand Bitcoin adoption locally and Bitcoin awareness globally.\n\nWeb3Ladies is a Web3 community in Africa empowering a generation of female industry leaders who will build, nurture, and develop a sustainable Web3 space. Their aim is to foster a community of excellent, passionate, and groundbreaking ladies in the African Web3 space, who can work together, not only to challenge the status quo but also to create impactful open-sourced solutions in the Web3 space.\n\nThis is one of the largest Bitcoin communities in Africa, consisting of Africans from different parts of the continent who believe in the Bitcoin revolution and are building a movement to bolster its adoption. The Africa Bitcoin Organisation is led by human rights activist Farida Nabourema.\n\nBitcoin Dada is a community for the African woman to learn about Bitcoin, while being part of a women-focused community that wants her to succeed. The community was founded to try to resolve three issues in the ecosystem: reduce the knowledge barriers for everyday women to enter the Bitcoin world; make Bitcoin relatable to the masses; lastly, to narrow the gender gap in the space through education, community, and social network platforms.\n\nSince its launch, Bitcoin Dada has successfully trained two cohorts of students, held Bitcoin-only meet-ups in Nairobi, Kenya, helped some students start accepting Bitcoin as a payment option in their businesses, and recommended students to Bitcoin companies for employment.\n\nThis crypto community was initiated in 2022 to give its members access to information and tools necessary to profit from crypto and NFT projects. The discord-based community has since grown to 4,000 members.\n\nShare this article"

        "title": "Reflecting on a decade of Bitcoin: From 10,000 Bitcoins for a pizza to a $1 trillion market capitalization\ufffc - The Financial Express",
        "content": "By Parth Chaturvedi\n\nOn May 22, 2010, a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz made history by purchasing two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. At the time, Bitcoin was worth just a fraction of a cent, and few people had even heard of it. Today, Bitcoin is the most valuable and widely recognised crypto asset in the world and had hit a peak market capitalization of over $1 trillion, during the last bull run. The value of 10,000 BTC today is approx ~$270mm!\n\nSo, while Laszlo Hanyecz\u2019s decision to trade 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas may seem foolish in hindsight, at the time, it was a bold and visionary move that helped demonstrate the potential of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and was the first recorded purchase of goods via a crypto asset. The story of Bitcoin Pizza Day is a reminder of the early days of crypto when enthusiasts were experimenting with a new and untested technology.\n\nToday, Bitcoin Pizza Day has become an annual celebration of the crypto revolution and the incredible journey that this asset class has taken over the past decade. BTC is now accepted by merchants around the world, used as a store of value by investors, and even recognized as legal tender in some countries.\n\nThe growth of crypto has been driven by a combination of technological innovation, financial speculation, and a growing recognition of the flaws and limitations of traditional financial systems. The recent banking crisis, \u201cDebt ceiling\u201d debate and Trillions in money printing have further made BTC\u2019s \u201chard money\u201d and \u201cfixed supply schedule\u201d narrative more appealing to the holders of \u201cDigital Gold\u201d!\n\nBut what does the future hold for this rapidly evolving asset?\n\nOne key trend in the future of BTC as an asset class is its increasing recognition and adoption by mainstream institutions. Major corporations such as Tesla, MicroStrategy and most recently PayPal have significant investment holdings in Bitcoin, and a growing number of traditional financial giants like Fidelity and BNY Melon are exploring ways to incorporate BTC into their products and services. This increased acceptance and integration by mainstream institutions could help drive greater stability and acceptance of Bitcoin in the broader economy.\n\nAnother important trend in the future of Bitcoin is the development of new and innovative use cases beyond simple transactions and store of value. Post the Taproot upgrade, there has been an explosion of innovation using the underlying Bitcoin Network. The most recent and impactful development has been Ordinals, which are being used to create unique inscriptions on the Bitcoin Network and can store metadata such as artwork or collectibles.\n\nAs we look towards the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem, it is important to continue investing in innovation, collaboration, and responsible regulation. This will require the participation and cooperation of a diverse set of stakeholders, including government regulators, industry leaders, and everyday users. By working together to address the challenges and opportunities of crypto, we can create a more inclusive, transparent, and secure financial system for all.So, let\u2019s raise a slice of pizza to Bitcoin, its incredible potential, and the exciting future ahead!\n\nThe author is Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"

His home was searched, his computer and other digital devices seized, and data recovered from them.\n\nDI Rob Bryant of the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit's cyber crime team said: \u201cI would like to thank the company and their employees for their support and cooperation during this investigation.\n\n\"I hope this sends a clear message to anyone considering committing this type of crime. We have a team of cyber experts who will always carry out a thorough investigation to catch those responsible and ensure they are brought to justice.\u201d\n\nThe police said that firms who believed they had been the victim of cyber crime should contact Action Fraud immediately."

        "content": "In the past, major precious metals have been viewed by investors as safe-haven assets during the development of financial crises. However, the rise of digital financial technology has given rise to a new type of digital gold: Bitcoin. This was highlighted by a recent analytical review by Bitcoinist experts who compared the dynamics of gold, Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nWhile gold prices are up 9 percent this year, bitcoin is up more than 70 percent, according to the analysis. Despite the U.S. banking crisis, Bitcoin has continued to gain momentum, rising 30% in the past week alone, from $19,000 to $28,500.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has lagged behind, with prices up just 13% over the past seven days.\n\nExperts from Bitcoinist point out that more and more investors are considering investing in the cryptocurrency space these days.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rise as digital gold is due to its scarcity, decentralization, and security. These factors, along with a growing number of institutional investors, have contributed to the incredible growth in the value of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies and their mining are certainly risky, the potential rewards are enormous. With the right knowledge and resources, it is possible to generate substantial profits and benefit from the growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIf you want to try Bitcoin mining \u2013 it would be wise to focus on accumulating affordable mining hashrate before the price starts to rise. You can now choose your bitcoin mining contract in Idmining.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the dynamics of gold, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies evolve over time as the world continues to embrace digital financial technologies. Invest in Bitcoin while it is still cheap to get into Bitcoin mining and avoid future regrets for missed opportunities.\n\nWhat are the main advantages of investing in cloud mining contracts:\n\nWhen investing in BTC, you need to understand fundamental analysis to know when is the best time to buy or sell cryptocurrency. Cloud mining all but eliminates this need for investors. When buying a cloud contract, the revenue becomes passive: the company takes over the maintenance, repair and tuning of the mining machine, while the client simply withdraws the profit; Miners can hedge risk by selling BTC during growth and buying new contracts when the price drops (and becomes cheaper), or simply store the cryptocurrency in a secure wallet until growth resumes; Also, under the current blockchain hash rate conditions, when you buy a mining contract, it turns out that the BTC price will be lower than the price you buy on a crypto exchange. If you invest $2,000, you can only buy 0.13 BTC for this amount. But you can mine twice that amount \u2013 0.3 BTC for the same amount of money.\n\nTherefore, investing in cloud mining is more flexible, profitable and secure, especially in the long-term.\n\nA legitimate cloud mining business was established in the UK in 2016 under the name IDMining. Like any legitimate hash provider, IDMining has commercial properties with a sizable tech park of specialized Bitcoin mining equipment.Brazil & Windhoek & Kazakhstan all have data center locations. Nowadays, IDMining pays out cryptocurrencies to more than 4,90K users from around the world.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSign up to get $5 immediately.\n\nAutomated daily payouts.\n\nNo overhead or electricity fees.\n\nAn affiliate program with 3% lifetime rewards.\n\nDifferent Crypto contracts to choose from.\n\nDDos and SSL protect the system.\n\n24-hour online support.\n\nNew Crypto Mining Plans\n\nContract Price Contract Terms Fixed Return $100 1 Day $100+$2 $300 3 Days $300+$20.7 $800 7 Days $800+$140 $1300 15 Days $1300+$546 $8200 40 Days $8200+$10496 $15800 60 Days $15800+$29388\n\nFor more IDMining details, please visit https://idmining.com/\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "May 22, 2023 will be the 13th anniversary of \u201cBitcoin Pizza Day,\u201d the event that saw the first documented BTC transaction for a real product.\n\nHere are this year\u2019s events.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day: what is it and what is being celebrated?\n\nIt was 22 May 2010, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer, made history by buying two Papa John\u2019s pizzas for 10,000 BTC. At the time, the value was about $41.\n\nHanyecz\u2019s intent was to demonstrate Bitcoin\u2019s potential also as a currency for everyday transactions, a theory he created for himself as an early adopter of BTC.\n\nAnd so, Hanyecz posted an offer on a Bitcoin Talk forum, where he promised 10,000 BTC to anyone willing to buy him a couple of pizzas. It was not long before a forum user accepted the offer and ordered the pizzas for him.\n\nAs time went on, and as the price of BTC rose thanks to increased demand from users, the Bitcoin Pizza Day event became so symbolic for the entire crypto community that it is celebrated with dedicated events every year.\n\nNot only that, in addition to dedicated events, is also a day to meditate on the incredible value those two pizzas have achieved over time. For example, if we consider BTC at $27,000, now those two pizzas would be worth as much as $270 million.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day: crypto-exchange events for this 13th anniversary\n\nAmong the biggest supporters of Bitcoin Pizza Day, you can\u2019t miss the number one crypto-exchange in terms of popularity, Binance, which again this year is raffling off lots of prizes.\n\nTo celebrate #Bitcoin Pizza Day, we're kicking off a series of #BinancePizza events worldwide!\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s some of what you can look forward to:\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Pizza\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Giveaways\n\n\ud83d\udd38 #Binance merch\n\n\ud83d\udd38 And much more!\n\n\n\nBut which countries are we heading to?

Submit your entry now to win!\u201d\n\nLaszlo and paying for pizzas in Lightning Network\n\nThree years ago, the programmer who became famous for Bitcoin Pizza Day wanted to strike again by buying more pizzas in BTC, but using the Lightning Network (LN). At that time, Hanyecz paid 649,000 satoshi, or 0.00649 BTC.\n\nDespite his first big \u201closs\u201d by buying the first two pizzas with 10,000 BTC, Laszlo wanted to demonstrate once again what could be the only solution to scale the Bitcoin blockchain, namely the Lightning Network.\n\nAt the time of writing, 0.00649 BTC is equivalent to $157, a far cry from the $270 million equivalent of the first pizzas."
