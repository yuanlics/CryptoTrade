        "title": "MicroStrategy is profitable again after rise in Bitcoin vindicates CEO Michael Saylor\u2019s crypto strategy\u2014for now - Fortune",
        "content": "MicroStrategy Inc., the enterprise-software maker that is the largest publicly-traded holder of Bitcoin, returned to profitability in the second quarter after having to take a large writedown a year earlier because of a plunge in the value of the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company had net income of $22.2 million, or $1.54 a share, compared with a loss of more than $1 billion, or $94 a share, in the year-ago period.\n\nThe company, controlled by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates, with sales dropping 1.4% to $120.4 million. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected $123.2 million. The firm recorded digital-asset impairment losses of $24.1 million.\n\nMicroStrategy acquired about $361.4 million in Bitcoin during the second quarter, the company\u2019s largest purchase since prices peaked in late 2021. That brought MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin purchases to around $4.53 billion. The company bought 467 more tokens since June 30, according to a statement Tuesday. As of July 31, the company held 152,800 Bitcoin.\n\nIn a filing Tuesday, MicroStrategy said it may raise as much as $750 million via share sales and use the proceeds for general corporate purposes \u2014 including Bitcoin purchases and working capital \u2014 as well as the repurchase of debt.\n\nSaylor began buying Bitcoin in 2020, citing the need to reduce the company\u2019s holdings of cash because of the perceived eroding threat of inflation. The shift came as revenue from the software business stagnated. Saylor gave up his chief executive officer title a year ago, saying he would focus on the Bitcoin aspect of the company\u2019s dual strategy.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s operations are still unprofitable, having booked a quarterly operating loss of $26.7 million in the quarter. The company has over $700 million in deferred tax benefits from prior writedowns of its Bitcoin holdings. Now that Bitcoin has recovered in value, the company has removed a valuation allowance against the tax assets.\n\nPhong Le, who took over as CEO when Saylor shifted to executive chairman, said on a conference call Tuesday that the company\u2019s chief revenue officer resigned and he has assumed those responsibilities.\n\nBitcoin closed the second quarter up 7% to $30,390, building on a first-quarter surged of almost 72%. In last year\u2019s second quarter, the largest digital currency by market value had tumbled 59% to $18,731.\n\nBitcoin rose as much as 2.8% on Wednesday and was trading at $29,715 as of 11:30 a.m. in Singapore.\n\nShares of MicroStrategy, which serve as a Bitcoin proxy for many equity investors, was little changed at around $434 after the close of regular trading. They\u2019ve more than tripled this year, after tumbling 74% in 2022. The stock soared as high as $1,315 in February 2021."

        "title": "Fort Worth was the first city to adopt bitcoin mining to attract attention. Was it worth it? - Fort Worth Report",
        "content": "A year ago, Fort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker joked the city was now \u201ccowtown and cryptocurrency\u201d after plugging in donated bitcoin mining machines. That news generated millions of web impressions across the world, a nominal amount of money and attracted a blockchain summit to the city.\n\nSince the peak of the industry\u2019s hype in 2021 and the city\u2019s adoption of the machine, the cryptocurrency market lost more than $2 trillion in 2022. Startups, job postings and venture capital fundraising around the crypto industry have also dropped.\n\nFort Worth city officials are leaving the machine donated by the Texas Blockchain Council running, despite the hype around the industry slowing down. The city will not disclose the amount of money it takes to keep the machine running.\n\n\n\nFort Worth first adopted two bitcoin machines in April 2022, becoming the first city to mine bitcoin. Quinn PR crafted a media campaign to promote Fort Worth\u2019s tech-friendly leadership. The media attention generated more than 752 million web impressions in six months, according to the city. Headlines in national news outlets, such as USA Today, read: \u201cFort Worth, Texas becomes first in the US to mine bitcoin: \u2018Where the future begins.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn interviews with major TV news outlets, Parker said the pilot project was about making the city at the forefront of tech and innovation.\n\nWhat\u2019s bitcoin? What\u2019s mining? Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency, a digital currency that is not backed by an establishment such as a bank. To make sure each bitcoin transaction is verified, machines in a network compete to solve a complicated math problem. If the machine solves it first, it becomes the official record of the transaction. A bitcoin is given in exchange as an award to the first miner that solves the math problem. This process is called mining.\n\n\u201cWe want to be at the forefront of this industry, and understand that cryptocurrency is synonymous with innovation right now across the United States, really across the world,\u201d Parker said in an interview on CNBC when the project was announced.\n\nCritics of the crypto industry cite concerns about the machine\u2019s energy consumption in a state with a fragile power grid. The Texas Blockchain Council, the industry association that donated the three machines, and city officials maintained the machines take up the same amount of energy as a vacuum cleaner.\n\nTwo months later, the city traded the machine for a more energy-efficient machine. Carlo Capua, chief of strategy and innovation at the City of Fort Worth, recommended keeping the machines going at a city council meeting last November. The miner running in the city\u2019s server room has generated nearly $2,000 after electricity costs since being plugged in, Capua said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe goal wasn\u2019t to make money, that wasn\u2019t the primary objective,\u201d Capua said. \u201cIt was for people to know about the city, know that Fort Worth is a dynamic, forward-thinking city and doing innovative things that no other cities have done. So in that sense, it\u2019s been very successful.\u201d\n\nThe mining machine is profitable every month, Capua said, but he declined to provide the total energy cost since it was plugged in. The machine, a Bitmain S19 J Pro, takes 2,950 watts to operate. The city runs the machine 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur rate with our energy provider is confidential, so I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t share the total electricity cost as it would be easy for someone to reverse engineer our rate,\u201d Capua wrote in an email.\n\nOne tangible result of the pilot program is the Texas Blockchain Council moving its Texas Blockchain Summit from Austin to the Fort Worth Convention Center in November. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, said the council decided to move the summit because of the city\u2019s friendliness to the industry. He expects more than 1,000 attendees at the summit, which occurs Nov. 15-17.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really excited about that and excited for what that means for the city and for the leap of faith that Mayor Parker took when she decided to do this initiative,\u201d Bratcher said.\n\nA tumultuous year for the crypto industry\n\nFort Worth\u2019s mayor wasn\u2019t alone in following the crypto hype, Tonantzin Carmona, a David Rubenstein Fellow at Brookings Metro, said.\n\nNew York City\u2019s Mayor Eric Adams announced his first paycheck would be converted to bitcoin and ethereum in 2022. Austin business leaders and officials also tried to draft resolutions to make the city a hub for cryptocurrencies and blockchain. In Miami, the mayor endorsed a city-branded coin, only for it to drop 95% in price.\n\nMayors and local leaders are under pressure to innovate, create new economies and bolster existing ones, Carmona said, and it makes sense to look to technology and innovation as potential ways to spur economic growth. But leaders need to do their due diligence to weigh the pros and cons of the industry.\n\n\u201cAssessing, one, is it even right for our economy?\u201d Carmona said. \u201cDo we have a strategy around this? Do we have an existing infrastructure or ecosystem of other types of \u2026 industry that can help support this new industry or technology that we\u2019re trying to bring to our local economy?\u201d\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry had a tumultuous year. Toward the end of 2022, the crash of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto exchange, FTX, sent crypto values spiraling.\n\nAn analysis by Brookings Metro found job postings with crypto skills dropped since the peak in early 2022, including in the Dallas and Fort Worth area. Crypto startup growth also fell. Carmona, the author of the study, said most of the crypto jobs happened in places that were already tech hubs.\n\nThe city purposely took a more cautious approach to crypto than Miami\u2019s \u201cfull-throttle\u201d approach, Capua said. The city does not endorse the crypto industry \u2013 or any industry, Capua also said. He doubts cryptocurrency will ever replace the dollar, but he still thinks the pilot project was worth the time.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the smart way to \u2026 investigate innovative technology is to do it in small steps,\u201d Capua said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nThe mining machine, Capua said, continues to keep the city relevant. He gives anecdotes of visitors traveling to City Hall asking about the machine. He still mentions the machine when talking to people about innovative things the city is doing, and still gets requests for updates.\n\n\n\nCarmona, however, remains skeptical about the impact of the pilot project and the accomplishment aside from literal attention. She said cities need to think about whether industries are speculative or have well-documented productive activity and potential.\n\n\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies, when you invest in them, aren\u2019t tied to a company\u2019s revenue profit, a company\u2019s growth,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just based on whether people believe that it\u2019s going to rise in value or not.\u201d\n\nMattie Parker was unavailable for an interview at the time of publication, but said in a statement that local leaders have to embrace out-of-the-box ideas in the community to fuel innovation. Parker wrote that the city is continuing to build on the mindset of expanding what\u2019s possible in the city with the Techstars Physical Health Fort Worth Accelerator, Texas A&M-Fort Worth\u2019s Research and Innovation Building and Alliance\u2019s Mobility innovation zone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing Fort Worth transform into a hub for technology, and it\u2019s not just because of the pioneering spirit of our entrepreneurs, but also because City Hall has a vested interest in helping them be successful,\u201d Parker wrote. \u201cThis program is just one example of how we\u2019re looking to expand the conversation about what is possible in Fort Worth.\u201d\n\nThose involved in the crypto industry, like Bratcher, say the crypto market has ups and downs like the oil and gas market. The industry is still recovering, but Bratcher believes crypto is on the upswing.\n\n\u201cJust like there have been tumultuous times in other innovative technologies throughout history, the amount of economic growth that this industry is going to inject will be far greater than \u2026 some of the challenges that we experienced this year moving forward,\u201d Bratcher said.\n\nThe mining machine will continue to run until the machine becomes obsolete or the City Council votes to stop the machine, Capua said. He\u2019s shifting gears to other projects, like efforts to attract businesses from outside the U.S. like Japan to establish business in Fort Worth. He\u2019ll be working with cities such as Dallas and Arlington to figure out transportation solutions as the World Cup in Arlington approaches in 2026. He also said there are a couple of development projects he can\u2019t talk about yet.\n\n\n\nThe city created Capua\u2019s position last year, and he said there are a lot of possibilities beyond adopting new technology.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new position,\u201d Capua said. \u201cSo to be quite honest, a lot of it, I\u2019m looking for opportunities, where we haven\u2019t really spent a lot of time.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeth Bodine is a business and economic development reporter for the Fort Worth Report.

        "title": "Bitcoin launderer pleads guilty, admits to massive Bitfinex hack - CNBC",
        "content": "watch now\n\nA New York man on Thursday admitted to being the original hacker of bitcoin in the 2016 cyberattack on Bitfinex, a theft that ended up being worth $4.5 billion. Ilya \"Dutch\" Lichtenstein, 35, made that bombshell admission while pleading guilty to laundering the stolen bitcoin in Washington, D.C., federal court. The plea came before his wife, 33-year-old Heather Rhiannon Morgan, who was in the audience, stepped up to enter her own guilty plea to two charges, money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the United States government. Until Thursday's admission in court by Lichtenstein, it was not publicly known who had hacked the bitcoin from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. The couple was not charged in the hack itself.\n\nBooking photos for Heather Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein. Courtesy: Alexandria Adult Detention Center.\n\nLichtenstein faces a maximum possible sentence of 20 years in prison for one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The Russian emigre, has been held without bond since his arrest after a judge ruled he is a flight risk, will remain jailed until his sentencing, and has agreed to cooperate with federal investigators. Morgan, an aspiring rapper known as \"Razzlekhan\" and \"The Crocodile of Wall Street,\" faces a maximum possible sentence of five years in prison. She was in the courtroom for her husband's plea hearing. Morgan has been free on $3 million bond since her arrest. Lichtenstein smiled at her and blew her a kiss during their moment of eye contact, the first time they had seen each other in more than a year.\n\nCourtroom sketch of Ilya \"Dutch\" Lichtenstein while pleading guilty to laundering the stolen bitcoin in Washington, D.C., federal court. Artist: William Hennessey\n\nWhen they were arrested in February 2022, the Department of Justice said officials had seized more than 94,000 bitcoin of the more than 119,000 hacked bitcoin. The seized cryptocurrency at the time was worth about $3.6 billion, making it the largest seizure in DOJ history. \"Since their arrests, the government has seized another approximately $475 million tied to the hack,\" the DOJ said in a press statement Thursday. Bitfinex in a statement said, \"Following the August 2016 hack, Bitfinex engaged in unprecedented efforts to make its customers whole.\" \"Bitfinex also diligently worked with the U.S. Department of Justice to identify the perpetrators of the hack, recover the stolen bitcoin, and bring the hackers to justice,\" the company said. \"After seven years, those efforts have come to fruition.\" When the bitcoin was stolen, it was worth just $70 million. But its value soared over the years to $4.5 billion. In its statement Thursday, the DOJ said, \"Lichtenstein used a number of advanced hacking tools and techniques to gain access to Bitfinex's network.\" \"Once inside their systems, Lichtenstein fraudulently authorized more than 2,000 transactions in which 119,754 bitcoin was transferred from Bitfinex to a cryptocurrency wallet in Lichtenstein's control,\" the DOJ said.\n\nHeather Rhiannon Morgan, who was in the audience, stepped up to enter her own guilty plea hearing in the case. Artist: William Hennessey\n\n\"Lichtenstein then took steps to cover his tracks by going back into Bitfinex's network and deleting access credentials and other log files that may have given him away to law enforcement\" the DOJ said. \"Following the hack, Lichtenstein enlisted the help of his wife, Morgan, in laundering the stolen funds.\" When the couple was arrested in early 2022, the department said about \"25,000 of those stolen bitcoin were transferred out of Lichtenstein's wallet via a complicated money laundering process that ended with some of the stolen funds being deposited into financial accounts controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan.\"\n\nHeather Rhiannon Morgan, who was in the audience, stepped up to enter her own guilty plea hearing in the case. Artist: William Hennessey\n\nDuring Lichtenstein's plea hearing, it was revealed that he had converted some assets to gold coins, and that Morgan had buried gold coins at a location now known to law enforcement officials. And it also was revealed that Lichtenstein's past travel to Ukraine and Kazakhstan was done to convert digital assets to cash through Russian and Ukrainian middlemen. That cash was then shipped to addresses in Russia and Ukraine, where Lichtenstein picked it up physically and deposited it into U.S. accounts so he could retrieve it while in New York City. The Crypto Couple's separate plea hearings were moved up from their originally scheduled times Thursday due to arraignment later in the afternoon at the same courthouse of Donald Trump. The former president was charged Thursday in that case with crimes related to an effort to overturn his 2020 election loss. A charging document filed last month against the couple says that in early 2107 Lichtenstein \"began to move a portion of the bitcoin\" stolen in the hack \"in a series of small, complex transactions across multiple accounts and platforms.\"\n\nCourtroom sketch of Ilya \"Dutch\" Lichtenstein while pleading guilty to laundering the stolen bitcoin in Washington, D.C., federal court.

        "title": "Bitcoin is a boon to ESG: KPMG - Blockworks",
        "content": "Professional services firm KPMG is out with a new report that strikes a surprisingly friendly tone toward bitcoin and its impact on the environment.\n\nThe Big Four accounting firm\u2019s ultimate conclusion was that Bitcoin \u201cappears to provide a number of benefits across an ESG framework\u201d through stabilizing energy grids, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing sustainable heat for commercial and residential properties.\n\nESG, or environmental, social and governance, is a metric that defines how companies and their activities impact the world. Some investors may look at corporations\u2019 ESG scores to screen out stocks that don\u2019t meet their standards of social responsibility.\n\nThe report\u2019s authors point out that despite the network using a considerable amount of energy, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t expel direct carbon emissions. It does, however, run on electricity, the cost of which is always at the top of mind for individuals or companies mining bitcoin (BTC), KPMG claimed in the report.\n\nTherefore, miners are \u201cconstantly searching for the lowest cost sources of electricity, which is often tied to under-utilized hydro, wind or solar,\u201d KPMG wrote.\n\nThis statement bears out among even the biggest mining companies.\n\nBlockworks reported in July that Bitfarms is using hydroelectric power from dams to juice its rigs in Paraguay. Likewise, Back in 2021, Blockstream partnered with Jack Dorsey\u2019s Square to build a solar-powered bitcoin mine in Texas.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s critics don\u2019t often focus on the sources of energy miners use. Usually, they\u2019re focused on the amount of energy used.\n\nThat was the rationale behind the proposal from the administration of US President Joe Biden to levy a 30% tax on electricity used up by bitcoin miners. The White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors argued that the tax would encourage \u201cfirms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society\u201d and the environment.\n\nKPMG pushed back on that view, citing a Harvard Business Review article that said Bitcoin accounts for roughly 0.55% of the world\u2019s electricity consumption \u2014 similar in scope to how much energy tumble-style laundry dryers use.\n\nRead more: Latest use for bitcoin mining rig heat: Laundry\n\nThe Bitcoin Mining Council, an industry group, claimed in a 2022 fourth-quarter report that Bitcoin\u2019s global share is just 0.17% of the world\u2019s energy production.\n\nThe KPMG report also delved into the nuances of energy grid function, particularly with renewable energy sources like solar and wind.\n\nThe issue with solar energy, the reported contends, is that it\u2019s only available during the day, and wind is variable.\n\n\u201cRenewable energy facilities are incentivized to produce at their maximum capacity to deliver electricity in a manner consistent with their contractual agreements,\u201d the report says. \u201cThis can leave utilities with an excess supply of electricity, which if coupled with a supply and demand mismatch, can lead to low, and even negative, electricity prices.\u201d\n\nBitcoin miners can set up anywhere and often have the luxury to locate near renewable energy sources. Additionally, they can adjust their power consumption during times of excess supply and/or low market demand.\n\nBitcoin miners can actually \u201cprovide additional incentive to the buildout of renewable energy capacity,\u201d the report\u2019s authors argued.\n\nKPMG\u2019s report also highlighted the ways in which Bitcoin mining could improve sustainability and limit pollution.\n\nFor instance, it mentioned how mining rigs generate a significant heat byproduct while they\u2019re running.\n\nIn June, Blockworks reported on a Brooklyn spa that used miners to warm up their pools, a phenomenon that got plenty of social media buzz at the time.\n\nBeyond Bitcoin\u2019s ability to power hot tubs, KPMG claims there\u2019s a real possibility for Bitcoin to limit the amount of methane pollution, a greenhouse gas that is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide.\n\nA way to limit methane\u2019s damage potential is through a process called gas flaring, which entails burning the gas before it can go directly into the atmosphere. KPMG once again cited the Harvard Business Review article, which claimed there is enough flared natural gas in the US and Canada alone to power the entire Bitcoin network.\n\nMarathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel told Blockworks in May that the government should be doing more to tackle methane emissions and that bitcoin mining companies are the \u201cperfect\u201d partner in that fight.\n\n\u201cGive people incentives to convert methane gas into something less volatile,\u201d Thiel said. \u201c[Bitcoin miners] can set up operations at landfills where they can\u2019t sell the electricity, where they can\u2019t convert it into natural gas, and take that methane that\u2019s seeping out into the atmosphere and convert it to carbon dioxide.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

He has compared Bitcoin to gold, mentioning it as \u201cdigitizing gold,\u201d indicating its potential as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation across different countries.He also goes on record to call the underlying Bitcoin technology \u201cfantastic\u201d.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Experience In ETFs\n\nIn 2023, BlackRock unveiled the iShares Global Corporate Bond ETF, offering investors a comprehensive mix of global corporate bonds exposure. Simultaneously, they launched the BlackRock U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness ETF, targeting U.S. companies poised to thrive in a low-carbon future. BlackRock has had 575 ETF applications accepted and only 1 rejected back in 2014.\n\nBlackRock holds history as an ETF innovators, introducing a series of 17 ETFs, among which were the first-ever international ETFs granting exposure to Mexico, Canada, and Brazil. Throughout its history, BlackRock has continuously pushed the boundaries of ETF offerings, reaffirming its position as a leading force in the financial industry.\n\nWhat Is BlackRock\u2019s iShares Blockchain And Tech ETF\n\nThe iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF aims to replicate the investment performance of an index consisting of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies engaged in the development, innovation, and utilization of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. Such types of ETFs are referred to as spot ETFs.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF directly holds and tracks the price of actual Bitcoins. A spot Bitcoin ETF provides investors with exposure to the real-time price movements of Bitcoin in the underlying market. This kind of ETF offers a direct and transparent way for investors to gain exposure to the Bitcoin price without the need to hold or manage actual Bitcoins themselves.\n\nThe credibility behind BlackRock\u2019s experience in ETFs and its position as the world\u2019s largest asset manager, carries significant weight and credibility in the financial industry. The SEC might view BlackRock\u2019s involvement as a sign of maturity and institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, which could positively influence the approval decision.\n\nBenefits of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF\n\nIf the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is launched we can expect the following beneficial ripple effects to impact the Bitcoin market:\n\nInstitutional adoption: If BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF receives approval, it could encourage more institutions to adopt cryptocurrencies, legitimizing the Bitcoin market and providing a secure and regulated entry point for investors.\n\nDiversification opportunity: With the inclusion of Bitcoin alongside other investment assets, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF could present investors with a chance to diversify their portfolios.\n\nEnhanced market structure: BlackRock\u2019s proposed Bitcoin ETF functions more like a spot ETF, enabling direct purchase and holding of actual Bitcoin, thereby avoiding issues seen in products relying on speculative futures contracts.\n\nMarket stability and transparency: BlackRock\u2019s reputable involvement might alleviate concerns about market manipulation, fostering a transparent and stable Bitcoin trading environment.\n\nReduced complexity for investors: A Bitcoin ETF provides an easier way for traditional investors to invest in Bitcoin without the need for digital wallets or cryptocurrency exchanges, making it more accessible.\n\nPotential price impact: The expectation of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF approval has had a positive effect on the market, leading to a swift recovery from recent Bitcoin losses.\n\nPotential Drawbacks Of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF\n\nIf the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is launched we can also anticipate some key potential drawbacks that should be considered such as:\n\nRegulatory hurdles: The SEC\u2019s history of rejecting spot Bitcoin ETF applications, with over 30 rejections, raises concerns as to whether they will accept BlackRocks spot ETF.\n\nWall Street influence: A spot Bitcoin ETF might trigger a Bitcoin bull market, but it could also give traditional finance firms more control over the cryptocurrency space, raising debates among market players and Bitcoin maximalists over the benefits behind BlackRock\u2019s ETF introduction.\n\nImpact on Bitcoin network: A significant portion of actual Bitcoin in financial products like ETFs, even one-third of supply, may potentially harm the network\u2019s decentralized nature and original purpose.\n\nUncertain approval: Optimism surrounds BlackRock\u2019s filing, but experts caution against expecting immediate approval. However, it is uncertain when it will be approved.\n\nHidden costs or risks: While some see BlackRock\u2019s ETF as positive for Bitcoin, others warn of potential hidden costs or risks linked to these financial products, such as manipulation and loss of decentralization.\n\nWill BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF Get The SEC Approval?\n\nIt is yet known whether BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF will get the SEC approval. However, the information indicates that the SEC has accepted BlackRock\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF for review.\n\nWhile there are no guarantees that the SEC will approve, BlackRock\u2019s filing has fueled speculation that permission is more likely due to their credibility in financial markets. It\u2019s important to note that the approval process for ETFs can be lengthy, and the SEC may request additional information or make further evaluations before making a final decision.\n\nBlackRocks Partnership With Coinbase Custody Trust Company\n\nBlackRock collaborates with Coinbase, providing institutional investors access to Bitcoin through Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the custodian. This partnership showcases the increasing interest of traditional financial institutions in the crypto market, offering institutional investors a trusted entry point with BlackRock\u2019s involvement.\n\nWhile the precise start date of their affiliation remains uncertain, it is believed to have commenced in the second quarter of 2022. Coinbase\u2019s role is critical in ensuring market integrity and overseeing potential market manipulation through a \u201csurveillance-sharing\u201d agreement.\n\nDesigned for institutions, Coinbase Prime provides a comprehensive suite of services, including advanced agency trading, custody, prime financing, staking, and infrastructure, along with data and reporting capabilities to support the entire transaction lifecycle.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we look to the future of Bitcoin, the emergence of ETFs, particularly with BlackRock\u2019s involvement, signals a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency\u2019s journey. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs may lead to increased institutional adoption, market stability, and enhanced transparency.\n\nAs traditional finance institutions like BlackRock step into the crypto space, they bring credibility and attract more investors. The combination of ETFs and BlackRock\u2019s expertise creates an avenue for broader participation, solidifying Bitcoin\u2019s position as a mature asset class, poised to enter a new phase of growth and acceptance on a global scale.\n\nFAQs\n\nWill BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF lead to increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies?\n\nYes, if approved, the ETF could encourage more institutions to enter the crypto market, legitimizing Bitcoin and attracting more investors.\n\nHow might BlackRock\u2019s ETF benefit investors?\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF offers diversification opportunities and a transparent way to invest in Bitcoin without handling actual cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat are the potential drawbacks of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF?\n\nInvestors should be aware of potential drawbacks with BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, including, regulatory hurdles, potential impact on the Bitcoin network decentralization, and uncertain ETF approval timelines are some concerns.\n\nHow does BlackRock\u2019s affiliation with Coinbase impact the crypto market?\n\nBlackRock\u2019s collaboration with Coinbase reflects growing institutional interest, enhancing market integrity and oversight of potential market manipulation."

        "content": "One of the most enduring mysteries in the world of cryptocurrencies was resolved Thursday when Ilya Lichtenstein acknowledged that he was the hacker who executed the 2016 attack on the Bitfinex exchange.\n\nLichtenstein, along with his social-media rapper wife, who dubbed herself the \u201cCrocodile of Wall Street,\u201d pleaded guilty to a money-laundering conspiracy tied to the theft of billions of dollars of Bitcoin from the exchange. Who executed the exploit has been the biggest guessing games in crypto after the identity of Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nLichtenstein, 35, admitted during a hearing on Thursday before US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly that he orchestrated the hack, which took 119,756 Bitcoin from Bitfinex. He faces as long as 20 years in prison.\n\nLichtenstein and Heather Morgan entered their pleas as part of cooperation agreements with prosecutors. The government had charged them with conspiring to launder those stolen Bitcoin. The couple was arrested in February 2022 in New York, but they were not accused of doing the actual hacking at the time. A detailed report published along with the arrest showed how they were able to move the stolen funds after the hack.\n\nMorgan, who also called herself \u201cRazzlekhan, said her husband didn\u2019t make her aware of the hack until early 2020, initially thinking that his funds might have come from drugs or tax avoidance. Morgan, 33, developed a social media presence by rapping about investment strategies, calling herself a risk-loving moneymaker who was \u201csly as a gator.\u201d\n\nThe pleas come as part of a deal the couple struck with the government following several delays they requested since their arrest last year. As part of the arrangement, both agreed to forfeit almost $73 million combined. Morgan, who also pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the US government, could face a maximum of five years in prison for the two counts.\n\nBitfinex is the crypto exchange affiliated with the world\u2019s largest stablecoin, USDT. At the time of the hack, the value of the stolen funds was estimated at about $71 million.\n\nBurying Gold Coins\n\nDuring the hearing, the government outlined details of how Lichtenstein conducted the hack and later enlisted Morgan to help hide the source of the illicit funds. For example, Morgan admitted to burying gold coins that Lichtenstein had converted from stolen funds, setting up fictitious accounts and holding some of the illegal proceeds in her own legitimate accounts.\n\n\u201cI did help him launder funds at his direction,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nMorgan also said her husband kept her in the dark about some of his activities, including subsequent hacks. \u201cI was not aware of any of these other hacks until his arrest,\u201d she said. When the pair traveled to Kazakhstan and Ukraine, Morgan said she thought the purpose was for tourism. \u201cI recall him burning documents at a trash can in Kazakhstan,\u201d she said, noting that he acted \u201cevasive\u201d when she questioned him.\n\nProsecutors alleged the two used fake identities to create online accounts and covered up the trail of transactions by depositing and withdrawing the stolen funds from virtual currency exchanges and darknet markets. Some of the money went to purchase nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, gold and Walmart gift cards, the government said.\n\nWhen Bitfinex was hacked, Bitcoin was trading under $1,000. It had skyrocketed to $44,000 by the time the couple was arrested in early 2022, pushing up the value of the stolen assets to $4.5 billion, of which $3.6 billion was recovered by authorities. Since then, the cryptocurrency has fallen to around $29,000.\n\nRead More: \u2018Crocodile of Wall Street\u2019 Arrested in $4.5 Billion Crypto Crime\n\nThe case is US v.

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining Greener Than Gold, Tourism, Fashion: KPMG Finds - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nKPMG reports Bitcoin is better for the environment than gold and tourism\n\nBitcoin miners prefer renewable energy\n\nWhat was Elon Musk thinking?\n\nA report released by KMPG, one of the world\u2019s main services network adjacent to the likes of PWC, highlights the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining. The study uses data from Harvard Business Review, showing that Bitcoin mining has a minuscule environmental impact compared with the fashion and gold mining industries.\n\nBitcoin Mining Is Not The Worst For The Environment\n\nSome may remember Elon Musk removing Bitcoin as a payment option from his flagship company Tesla. At the time, he claimed that Bitcoin mining was incredibly bad for the environment, adding, \u201cWe are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.\u201d\n\nThis came at a time when Tesla offloaded most of its Bitcoin deposits, which led the flagship cryptocurrency to take a dive in price.\n\nHowever, KPMG\u2019s report shows that Bitcoin mining has far fewer consequences on the environment compared to other industries, such as fashion, gold mining, and, most certainly, automobile manufacturing.\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining industry has become extremely competitive. Under this competitive landscape, miners are incentivized to streamline their operations and carefully manage production costs.\n\nAs electricity is the largest ongoing input cost affecting operations, miners are constantly searching for the lowest cost sources of electricity, which is often tied to underutilized hydro, wind, or solar,\u201d according to KMPG\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to an article by the World Economic Forum, \u201cCrypto mining can be a catalyst or market driver for new renewable energy projects.\u201d The article also claims that \u201cIt is this symbiosis of crypto computer farms and remote green energy projects which offers the potential for mutual benefits \u2014 and it may not stop with rural projects.\u201d\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Mining?\n\nKMPG\u2019s report states that \u201cBitcoin uses a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, which is the process of adding transactions to the blockchain by being the first to solve a mathematical problem via computation. This math problem involves repeatedly hashing a block of transactions until a specific output is achieved.\n\nHashing is the process of taking any string of text as an input and converting it to a fixed-length alphanumeric output.\n\nGiven that this is a one-way function, it means that the same input will always result in the same output, but the input cannot be determined with the output alone. Solving this math problem is essentially trying to find a needle in a haystack.\n\nMiners who solve the puzzle first are awarded freshly minted Bitcoin (currently 6.25 Bitcoin per block) as well as any transaction fees which currently account for about 2-3% of miner revenue\u201d\n\nIn a nutshell, Bitcoin miners use their computing power to solve mathematical problems in order to gain Bitcoin blocks on the chain as a reward."

According to Gamble, the steady entry of institutional investors and even central bankers experimenting with tokenized bonds and other yield-bearing assets could be a step in the right direction.\n\nThe best time to buy Bitcoin is now\n\nBitcoin\u2019s block reward halving is less than 300 days away, and many investors expect that BTC\u2019s price will go on a parabolic run \u2014 though this outcome is not guaranteed. The halving tends to introduce an extra dose of volatility to Bitcoin\u2019s price and can temporarily result in challenging times for Bitcoin miners. When asked about \u201cthe best time to buy Bitcoin,\u201d Gamble said he believes investors should be trying to buy it whenever they can. According to Gamble, the crypto sector is heading toward a $10 trillion market capitalization in the next few years, and if such a milestone is achieved, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are likely to see their value significantly increase.\n\nGamble explained that some of the liquidity and equipment acquisition problems that plagued the sector and Bitcoin miners in previous market cycles have been resolved by ASIC marketplaces that connect buyers to sellers. These marketplaces help miners acquire gear and spin up operations faster than ever before, and if a miner becomes financially distressed, it is also easier to offload equipment to raise liquidity.\n\nBasically, the presence of better infrastructure, participants\u2019 more mature approach to the crypto market, and the presence of institutional investors are clear fundamentals on which investors can build an investment thesis, according to Gamble.\n\nRelated: Was Sam Bankman-Fried behind a scam project?\n\nTo hear more of Gamble\u2019s thoughts on the future of the Bitcoin mining space, BTC price and the impact of the upcoming halving, tune in to the latest episode of Market Talks.\n\nMarket Talks airs every Thursday, featuring interviews with some of the most influential and inspiring people from the crypto and blockchain industry.

        "content": "A KPMG report says Bitcoin is a net positive for ESG goals.\n\nThe report argues that Bitcoin mining can help subsidise the cost of renewable energy.\n\nKPMG's Canadian arm previously invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2022.\n\nThe report found that Bitcoin uses about the same amount of electricity as tumble dryers globally.\n\nMajor accounting firm KPMG has released a report highlighting several ways Bitcoin has a positive impact on environmental, social, and governance criteria.\n\nOften shortened to ESG, these criteria are commonly used by socially conscious investors to judge a company\u2019s ethical and sustainable practices.\n\nThe report, co-authored by KPMG principal of technology risk Brian Consolvo and director of ESG Kirk Caron, refutes notions that Bitcoin has a mostly negative environmental and societal impact because of its high energy use and popularity among cybercriminals.\n\nBitcoin is \u2018widely misunderstood\u2019\n\n\u201cDespite Bitcoin\u2019s increased adoption, it continues to often be a misunderstood technology and asset class,\u201d the report said.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\n\u201cThis is a phenomenal endorsement,\u201d Daniel Batten, an ESG analyst and co-founder of CH4 Capital, a fund that specialises in methane mitigation technologies, told DL News. \u201cKPMG has done an outstanding job researching the nuances, because these conclusions, while true, are not obvious at first glance.\u201d\n\nAccording to report co-authors Consolvo and Caron, Bitcoin mining \u2014 the process of using powerful computers to solve the complex equations needed to validate transactions on the network \u2014 can help incentivise clean energy production, bolster financial inclusion, and even reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial activities.\n\nStill, there\u2019s no denying that Bitcoin uses a lot of energy.\n\nA common comparison is that the top crypto asset uses as much energy as a medium-sized country such as Norway annually, per data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nA different perspective\n\nBut Consolvo and Caron see the energy use from a different perspective. Using the same data, they highlight that Bitcoin uses about the same amount of electricity as tumble dryers globally.\n\n\u201cBitcoin miners can be a useful ally in the transition to more renewable energy sources and reduce emissions, despite its significant energy consumption,\u201d the report said.\n\nThey also say those criticising Bitcoin\u2019s energy use do so under the assumption that all industries should attempt to achieve net zero emissions.\n\nInstead, the report states, \u201cit\u2019s helpful to compare the emissions associated with Bitcoin\u2019s operations with the emissions of a wide range of industries and services.\u201d\n\nKPMG CO2 emissions from tourism, fashion and air conditioning dwarf those of Bitcoin. (KPMG)\n\nThe KPMG report focuses on four key areas in which Bitcoin mining can support environmental goals. It argues that mining can help subsidise the cost of renewable energy, balance electricity grids through demand response, heat buildings through recycled heat from mining rigs, and incentivise methane reduction.\n\nMethane in particular is one of the biggest contributors to climate change, and according to the US Environmental Protection Agency, is 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. It is emitted from many sources, such as coal mining, oil drilling and landfills.\n\nOverstated societal impacts\n\nFlaring \u2014 or burning \u2014 the gas breaks it down into carbon dioxide and water, and of course, releases energy. The report argues that using this energy to mine Bitcoin incentivises methane flaring and enables various industries to reduce the environmental impact of their operations.\n\nNOW READ: Green Bitcoin mining now cheaper than fossil fuels says Sazmining COO as mining company taps Paraguayan hydro dam\n\nAs for social impacts, the report notes the negative impact of Bitcoin\u2019s use in financial crime is overstated, citing a 2022 Chainalysis report which concluded the illegal use of crypto accounted for only 0.24% of all transaction volume in 2022.\n\nYet the report argues Bitcoin provides many benefits to society, particularly in low-income countries.\n\nIt enables low-cost cross-border payments \u2014 important for immigrants from developing countries such as Honduras, Haiti, and El Salvador who work abroad and regularly send money back to relatives in their home countries.\n\nIn Africa, Bitcoin mining is also helping subsidise electricity grids, helping bring power to millions and reducing costs for consumers.\n\nFor governance, the report lauds Bitcoin as a truly decentralised network that removes the need for trusted intermediaries.\n\nKPMG\u2019s investment in Bitcoin\n\nBecause Bitcoin is decentralised, no one single entity can exert control over it, making it highly resistant to attack and providing a high degree of confidence in the overall system.\n\nNOW READ: Circle can\u2019t shake SVB hangover as market cap dwindles to two-year low\n\nThe report argues that these attributes, coupled with the fact that Bitcoin\u2019s governance and rules are hard coded, results in a system that cannot be abused or misused by those in power or even individuals with ulterior motives.\n\nThe Bitcoin-friendly report follows KPMG\u2019s investment in Bitcoin, and the second-biggest cryptocurrency Ethereum, from its Canadian arm in 2022.\n\nAt the time, KPMG Canada managing partner Benjie Thomas said the investment reflected the firm\u2019s belief that \u201cinstitutional adoption of cryptoassets and blockchain technology will continue to grow and become a regular part of the asset mix.\u201d"

Investors piled $1.3bn into the ETF during the year ended June 30, according to Morningstar.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group.\n\nFees for the planned ETF were not disclosed.\n\nGlobal X declined to comment.\n\nGlobal X manages $41.8bn in assets across 107 ETFs, according to Morningstar.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be a tactical allocation ETF that adjusts the portfolio from bitcoin futures to T-bills whenever the bitcoin trend weakens,\u201d said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies for North America at Morningstar.\n\n\u201cMarket timing is extremely challenging, so these types of quantitative approaches tend not to be high performers\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first tactical strategy I\u2019ve seen for bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe first US bitcoin futures ETF, the $1.1 billion ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, launched in October 2021 and was quickly followed by similar offerings from VanEck and Valkyrie, Morningstar data shows.\n\nAlthough bitcoin futures ETFs do not hold the digital asset directly, several issuers have filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission has repeatedly shot down those applications because of concerns about potential manipulation and a lack of surveillance from the exchanges on which the ETFs would be listed.\n\nLast month, BlackRock set off the latest flurry of new applications or reapplications when it filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s application was quickly followed by similar applications from VanEck, Valkyrie, Fidelity, Invesco, WisdomTree and Bitwise. Ark Invest filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in April.\n\nThose spot filings should not be an impediment to the Global X ETF, Armour said.\n\n\u201cThis strategy has a risk-off mechanism that can cause performance to differ significantly from bitcoin itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThere could also be a long runway to a spot bitcoin ETF, leaving plenty of time for Global X and others to go after that market.\u201d\n\nIgnites is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

        "title": "Bitcoin Ordinals profitability falls in July, but total inscriptions pile on - Forkast News",
        "content": "The profitability of Ordinals inscriptions, an iteration of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin network, declined throughout July, Forkast Labs data show.\n\nMonthly NFT services revenue, or the sum of marketplace fees and creator royalties on the Bitcoin network, fell to US$1.22 million in July from US$3.13 million in June, suggesting lower profitability for Ordinals sales on the Bitcoin network.\n\nOrdinals is an iteration of NFTs on Bitcoin, the world\u2019s first and largest blockchain network by market capitalization. Bitcoin had a market capitalization of US$562 billion as of Tuesday, dominating 48.2% of the total cryptocurrency market.\n\nDespite lower profitability, Ordinals broke a daily inscriptions record on July 30 with 422,164, after reaching 20 million total inscriptions on July 28, showing the market\u2019s continued support and interest in Bitcoin-native NFTs, according to data from Dune Analytics. The network exceeded 21 million total inscriptions on Tuesday.\n\nTotal Ordinals-related transactions increased to 93,164 in July from 68,263 in June, CryptoSlam data showed. The number of monthly active Ordinals owners dropped to 81,171 in July from 118,122 in June.\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure firm Komodo, said that the oversaturation of Ordinals is among the main factors contributing to the declining profitability of Bitcoin NFTs.\n\n\u201cWith an influx of new projects and artists entering the space, buyers now face a plethora of options, diluting the value and appeal of individual pieces,\u201d Stadelmann told Forkast.\n\nTom Tirman, the chief executive officer of NFT rental platform IQ Protocol, suggested that the persistent creation of Ordinals could be a strategic move by investors who \u2014 having missed out on prior opportunities \u2014 are aiming to position themselves advantageously for the anticipated future expansions of Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nTirman said that the introduction of Ordinals came with an \u201cunsustainable hype that has largely cooled off,\u201d and that its recovery is a matter of time.\n\n\u201cAs we often see in other vital innovations recorded in the industry in the past, Ordinals are bound to regain their momentum after a remarkable use case is tagged with them,\u201d he said.\n\nProfits from secondary market sales have also been declining. The average sale price for Ordinals fell to US$214.03 in July from US$900 in June and US$1,178 in May, according to CryptoSlam data. At its peak in March, Ordinals traded at an average value of US$9,357.\n\nAccording to Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, the weaker Ordinals price reflects lower NFT sales volume, as declining interest from buyers pushes sellers to lower prices.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much potential on the crypto side of things for traders to want to trade NFTs or Ordinals right now, and there\u2019s also a bit of a liquidity issue. Simply put, traders are out of money. Bitcoin and crypto in general running will fix both of these issues,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nNot just Bitcoin\n\nAlthough key performance indicators for Ordinals tumbled in July, the Bitcoin network maintained its position as the month\u2019s second most active blockchain in the world for NFTs ranked by sales volume with over US$64.9 million, trailing Ethereum\u2019s US$273.9 million, CryptoSlam data shows.\n\n\u201cThe decline in total revenue for NFT services on the Bitcoin network after May does not necessarily signify a lack of interest in Ordinal inscriptions specifically,\u201d Anndy Lian, author of NFT: From Zero to Hero, told Forkast. \u201cInstead, it points to a broader trend in the NFT market as a whole. The decrease in revenue is likely indicative of a general downturn in the NFT market, affecting all types of NFT services and not just Ordinal inscriptions.\u201d\n\nDavid Atterman, the chief executive officer of crypto-based engagement platform Most.Fan, agreed with Liann, attributing the falling profitability of Ordinals to the poor performance of the overall NFT market.\n\n\u201cProjects that do not carry utility for new users and that do not focus on mass adoption, quickly lose their significance and are unlikely to recover at the next bull run,\u201d said Atterman.\n\nAccording to Petscher, the next NFT bull run will follow the cryptocurrency market.\n\n\u201cWe also need to see some type of innovation happen in NFTs to bring back traders who have realized that currently, there\u2019s not much substance that\u2019s worth investing in,\u201d he said.\n\nStandard Chartered, a British multinational bank, said in a July research report that Bitcoin prices will top US$120,000 in 2024, fueled by Bitcoin\u2019s halving event set to occur in April 2024. The halving will reduce Bitcoin\u2019s current supply inflow of 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes to 3.125 BTC. Each halving cycle to date has resulted in a new price record for Bitcoin.\n\nSee related article: Cardano \u2018ghost chain\u2019 outperforms top blockchains in NFT market"

        "content": "Bitcoin has erased early gains seen after MicroStrategy's announcement to boost its coin stash and Fitch's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating.\n\nRisk assets, including bitcoin, took a beating after S&P downgraded U.S. in August 2011.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) reversed early Asian session gains as the dollar index and the Treasury yield recouped losses seen after Fitch downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating from the top score.\n\nAt 04:25 UTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value changed hands at $29,600, down from the high of $30,032 registered at 01:30 UTC, per CoinDesk data.\n\nThe pullback reversed almost entire gains seen after bitcoin holder MicroStrategy announced plans to raise funds to boost its coin stash and the rating agency Fitch downgraded its credit rating for the U.S. government, from AAA to AA+, citing repeated brinkmanship over the debt ceiling.\n\nThe dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, fell from 102.14 to 101.95 in a knee-jerk reaction to the ratings downgrade, only to bounce back to 102.25 at press time. The 10-year Treasury yield chalked out a similar drop and pop to hover above 4%. Bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction of the greenback and bond yields.\n\nTwo of the so-called big three rating agencies have now placed the default rating at AA+. Moody's still has a top rating of AAA.\n\nThe S&P downgraded the U.S. to AA+ on Aug. 5, 2011, following which the dollar index and Treasury yields initially declined but quickly bounced back. Stocks tumbled, with bitcoin falling over 38% in the same month, data from TradingView show. The only major asset to rally alongside DXY was gold, which gained over 10%.\n\nThe dollar index and Treasury yields rose after the S&P downgraded U.S. on Aug. 5, 2011.\n\nIf history is a guide, the dollar index looks set to rise further, bringing more pain to bitcoin and stocks, although impending buying pressure from MicroStrategy might support the cryptocurrency's price.\n\nRead More: Bitcoin Whale Michael Saylor Might Buy a Lot More BTC\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of writing, futures tied to the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index pointed to a negative open with a 0.5% drop. As Asia began its business day, bitcoin jumped past $30,000 after software developer and bitcoin whale MicroStrategy submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell up to $750 million in stock with the intent of using the capital to purchase more BTC.\n\nMajor U.S. equity indexes \u2013 Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 \u2013 fell 0.4% and 0.3%, on Tuesday.\n\nIn a note to CoinDesk, Mark Connors, the head of research at Canadian digital asset manager 3iQ, wrote that the recent \"shift in market sentiment was NOT limited to digital assets, as equities took a breather.\"\n\n\"Our bellwether cross asset correlation metric hit a 20Y high as bonds and equities sold off,\" Connors wrote. \"Looking forward, we will monitor for any sharp reversal from this historically high correlation - as that has often signaled a risk reversal.\"\n\nETH, CRV track BTC lower\n\nThe CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, pulled back from $1,290 to $1,279, but was still up 2% on a 24-hour basis.\n\nEther, the native token of Ethereum, fell 0.5% from early Asian session highs to $1,860 taking cues from bitcoin's negative turnaround. Per one analyst, ether is overvalued and could slide further. Options market is seeing price weakness over the next six months.\n\nCurve's CRV token pulled back 5% to 58 cents. The cryptocurrency rose more than 20% to over 62 cents on Tuesday, likely on the back of a short squeeze. The increase came after Sun purchased more than $2 million worth of the token and pledged additional assistance through a liquidity pool on the Tron network. Curve fell victim to an exploit late Sunday, triggering a sell-off in CRV that got the market worried about potential liquidation of Curve founder's large borrowed position.\n\n\"Clearly, there are fears over a liquidation cascade happening within the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO of payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider BanxaI, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. \"I don\u2019t know how likely such a cascade is, but the market seems jittery as a result of these metastasizing issues. What\u2019s ironic is that DeFi had held up so well during the blowups of 2022, and yet it\u2019s an exploit more recently that might be the trigger for a DeFi blowup itself now.\"\n\nMico added that a judge's ruling against stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs' motion to dismiss a lawsuit against the SEC might \"be adding to the relatively soft sentiment in the market,\" but he noted that investors were buying up bitcoin's recent \"dips below $29,000...pretty quickly,\" a sign that buyers are accumulating in expectation of the SEC approving one of the recent spot BTC ETF applications.\n\nSee more: Get professional-grade crypto data and news at CoinDeskMarkets.com\n\nUPDATE (August 1, 2023, 23:43 UTC): Changes headline and opening paragraphs to reflect MicroStrategy filing and bitcoin price increase.\n\nUPDATE (August 2, 2023, 1:24 UTC): Reflects latest price increases for bitcoin and altcoins."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining involves the process of validating and recording transactions on the Bitcoin network. By digitally validating transactions in an attempt to prevent fraud and adding new blocks to the blockchain ledger, mining helps create new Bitcoins in a decentralized way.\n\nHistorically, it has been observed that bitcoin mining may remain profitable even during down markets for cryptocurrencies, while they habitually prosper when things are looking up. In a sense, by lending credence to cryptocurrency, bitcoin miners have assumed a defensive nature in the world of crypto.\n\nThere are obvious sectoral headwinds like high production costs and lower revenues per block mined that miners face during a downturn. However, in a year where the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has gone up 74.6% as of Aug 1, these overheads can be offset.\n\nThere is a bigger problem on the horizon though, with the scheduled April 2024 halving lurking around the corner. The halving is a planned reduction of Bitcoin emissions in each block and takes place every four years. This entails miners to deal with the sudden shock of revenues falling down by exactly half.\n\nHowever, because of its non-sudden nature, bitcoin miners have had a chance to prepare for the event. They have resorted to selling to improve their cashflows and sending large amounts of BTC to exchanges as a part of the de-risking strategy. For example, selling BTC one-year futures allows miners to lock in a selling price of $30,000 for the next year.\n\nSo, with a \u201ccrypto spring\u201d in the offing in 2023 and bitcoin miners already preparing their strategies for next year\u2019s halving, it would be prudent to watch a few bitcoin mining stocks that have done exceedingly well this year.\n\nHut 8 Mining Corp.

        "title": "Bitcoin Can Be ESG Driver - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Due to the energy-intensive nature of the bitcoin mining process, many consider miners and the digital currency itself detractors to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and sustainability objectives.\n\nThose criticisms can affect bitcoin mining equities and the exchange traded funds that hold those stocks, including the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) . Fortunately, some experts are optimistic that the bitcoin mining industry is cognizant of the need to be a better environmental steward. There is also optimism that it sees long-term benefits in boosting adoption of renewable energy.\n\nThe current proof-of-stake mining system contributes to air pollution and climate change. Indeed, the ASIC hardware used to mine bitcoin results in a process that produces Scope 1 emissions. This indicates that some SATO member firms would do well to increase adoption of green energy.\n\nAs noted by KPMG, bitcoin mining requiring a lot of energy isn\u2019t so much the problem as is the use of fossil fuels in the mining process. Bitcoin miners\u2019 consumption of fossil fuels creates harmful emissions, and that weighs on the industry\u2019s ESG credentials.\n\nBitcoin Miners Have Advantages\n\nSATO member firms can locate mining farms nearly anywhere they choose. This is advantageous when dealing with some reliability issues tied to renewables.\n\n\u201cRenewable energy facilities are incentivized to produce at their maximum capacity to deliver electricity in a manner consistent with their contractual agreements,\u201d observed KPMG. \u201cThis can leave utilities with an excess supply of electricity, which if coupled with a supply and demand mismatch, can lead to low, and even negative, electricity prices.\u201d\n\nBitcoin miners have the ability to be selective when it comes to location, as well as other advantages. Miners, including those that dwell in SATO, can leverage this over the long term to potentially bolster their ESG resumes.\n\nFirst, bitcoin miners can swiftly adjust to real-time demand conditions. In a hypothetical example, a bitcoin miner operating in the Phoenix can scale back activity during sweltering summer days. This would reduce energy consumption. Conversely, when energy demand falls during the more accommodating winter months, miners can increase output.\n\nSecond, as noted by KPMG, bitcoin miners can \u201cprovide additional incentive to the buildout of renewable energy capacity.\u201d Moreover, in a broad sense, bitcoin arguably isn\u2019t getting the ESG credit it deserves.\n\n\u201cBitcoin appears to provide a number of benefits across an ESG framework,\u201d concluded KPMG. \u201cThroughout its short history, new and innovative ways of leveraging the network and its native asset continue to emerge, such as helping to stabilize energy grids, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and even assist with providing sustainable heat to commercial and residential properties.\u201d\n\nVettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d) is the index provider for SATO, for which it receives an index licensing fee. However, SATO is not issued, sponsored, endorsed or sold by VettaFi, and VettaFi has no obligation or liability in connection with the issuance, administration, marketing or trading of SATO."

        "title": "If This One Valuation Model Is Right, Then Bitcoin Is a Screaming Buy - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Looking ahead to 2024, a growing number of investors are expecting the price of Bitcoin (BTC -0.19%) to surge in value. Some expect Bitcoin to soar past the $100,000 level, and still others expect Bitcoin to skyrocket past the $1 million mark.\n\nBut just how realistic are any of these predictions? After all, sometimes it feels like Bitcoin price predictions are based on nothing more than hope and a prayer. But there's one popular Bitcoin valuation model that has the attention of investors, and it's currently sending out some very bullish signals right now. Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe Stock-to-Flow model\n\nWhile there are a variety of ways to model Bitcoin's future price, one of the most popular is known as the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model. Simply stated, this is a way to model the future price of Bitcoin by treating it like a store-of-value commodity, much like gold, silver, or platinum. That makes sense, on a certain level, because Bitcoin has often been called \"digital gold.\"\n\nThe Stock-to-Flow model attempts to calculate the relative scarcity of Bitcoin in order to arrive at a valuation for the cryptocurrency. You simply divide the current existing supply of Bitcoin by the amount of new production that's coming online each year from Bitcoin miners and then plug this number into a simple mathematical formula. The Stock-to-Flow model relies on two primary inputs -- the amount of total circulating Bitcoin supply and the rate at which Bitcoin is currently being mined -- and both of these numbers are publicly available.\n\nRight now, for example, the total circulating supply of Bitcoin is 19.444 million coins. From the original Bitcoin white paper, we know that the total lifetime supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins and that the final Bitcoin will be mined in the year 2140. Thus, 92.6% of all Bitcoin has already been mined, and over the next 117 years, there will be a race to mine the remaining 7.4% of Bitcoins that are yet to be produced. As the scarcity of Bitcoin increases over time, we would expect the value of Bitcoin to increase as well.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving\n\nIn 2024, things get really interesting because that's when the next Bitcoin halving takes place. In a halving event, the total reward for mining a new block of Bitcoin drops by one-half. This is determined algorithmically and can not be changed. This halving obviously impacts Bitcoin miners because it changes the amount of Bitcoin that they can mine. All things being equal, the same number of Bitcoin mining machines working at the same rate next year is going to produce half the amount of Bitcoin that they will this year.\n\nThis is important because it has an impact on calculations for the Stock-to-Flow model. If Bitcoin is being produced at a 50% lower rate (as a result of the mining reward being cut in half), that immediately changes the denominator of the Stock-to-Flow model, which in turn produces a much higher suggested value for Bitcoin. According to the Stock-to-Flow model, we would expect the value of Bitcoin to \"jump\" every four years, which is when every new halving takes place. And indeed, this has been the case in 2012, 2016, and 2020.\n\nDrawbacks to this model\n\nHowever, there are several drawbacks to using this model. For one, it only takes into account the supply of Bitcoin. It does not factor into account demand (i.e., all the potential use cases of Bitcoin). And, as anyone knows from an introductory course in economics, the way you arrive at a price of an asset is by taking into account both supply and demand. That's why other valuation models for Bitcoin might have more predictive power.\n\nThe other big drawback is that this model can come up with some pretty ridiculous price targets. During the last big crypto boom, for example, Fidelity Investments used this same model to come up with a theoretical price of $100 million for Bitcoin. (Yikes!) The latest Bitcoin price target is anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million, according to PlanB, the anonymous creator of the Stock-to-Flow model.\n\nWhat happens to Bitcoin next?\n\nIf the Stock-to-Flow model is correct, then Bitcoin should be worth quite a bit more than it is now. Just how much higher, though, is still open for debate. Remember, as Warren Buffett once remarked, \"Price is what you pay; value is what you get.\" So, just because a valuation model says Bitcoin should be worth $100,000 by 2024 doesn't mean that's the price that people are going to be willing to pay for it."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s Q2 earnings show net income of $22.2 million\n\nLast Year was a $1.2 billion deficit\n\nThe company plans to purchase additional Bitcoins after selling stocks\n\nThe business intelligence company of Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy, disclosed its intentions to generate roughly $750 million through the sale of stocks to increase the amount of Bitcoins in the portfolio, which currently stands at 152,800 BTC, or $4.53 billion.\n\nIn addition, the platform reported the company\u2019s net income of $22.2 million in the second quarter results report . This is a significant increase from the $1.1 billion loss recorded in the previous year.\n\nCCN reached out to MicroStrategy for commentary but did not receive a reply at the time of publishing.\n\nThe cryptocurrency saw a surge when MicroStrategy announced in a recent filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the platform plans to expand its Bitcoin portfolio by adding more BTC coins.\n\nThe statement said :\n\n\u201cWe may offer and sell shares of our class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $750,000,000 from time to time through one or more of the Agents, acting as our sales agents.\u201d\n\nHuge Bitcoin Buyer Since 2020\n\nSaylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy, reiterated the company\u2019s excitement about accumulating Bitcoins earlier today on Twitter while providing an update on the platform\u2019s acquisition of the cryptocurrency.\n\nApril saw MicroStrategy purchase 1045 Bitcoins for a total estimated cost of $29.3 million, not long after revealing a massive acquisition of 6,500 Bitcoins.\n\nMicroStrategy added 12,333 Bitcoins to its second quarter, bringing its total holdings to $361.4 million from 12,800 in the first quarter. According to Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang of the company:\n\n\u201cWe efficiently raised capital through our at-the-market equity program and used cash from operations to continue to increase bitcoins on our balance sheet. And we did so against the promising backdrop of increasing institutional interest, progress on accounting transparency, and ongoing regulatory clarity for Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nSaylor started purchasing Bitcoin in 2020, claiming that the corporation needed to maintain less cash due to the inflation danger that was thought to be diminishing. A stagnation in software business revenue brought about the change.\n\nSaylor resigned as CEO a year ago, stating he would concentrate on the Bitcoin component of the business\u2019s two-pronged approach.\n\nNew CEO Takes Place\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s activities remain unprofitable, with an operating loss of $26.7 million for the quarter. Due to previous write-downs of its Bitcoin assets, the corporation has delayed tax savings totaling over $700 million. The corporation has eliminated a valuation allowance against the tax assets now that the value of Bitcoin has increased.\n\nOn a conference call on Tuesday, August 1, Phong Le, who became CEO after Saylor became executive chairman, announced that he had taken on the duties of the company\u2019s chief revenue officer, who had resigned. Some analysts claim that Saylor\u2019s investments will also pay off ahead of Bitcoin halving.\n\nBitcoin had a significant increase of 1.92% after MicroStartegy\u2019s disclosure. Before this, it was trading in the $28,000 region. With a market capitalization of $575,721,859,417 and a 24-hour trading volume of $19,688,414,825 at its current price of $29,434, Bitcoin continues to dominate the cryptocurrency industry."

        "title": "5 factors that could send Bitcoin to $1 million - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Although Bitcoin (BTC) has been moving in a largely sideways pattern for the past several weeks, some observers have noted that there was a possibility that the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset could eventually reach the coveted price of $1 million, making everyone who held at least one wholecoin significantly rich(er).\n\nIndeed, some of the sector\u2019s most famous investors, including Michael Saylor\u2019s business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which has purchased over 12,000 Bitcoin during the second quarter of 2023, are willing to bet that the maiden cryptocurrency will continue to grow its price, eventually culminating at $1 million, and Finbold has analyzed the factors that could lead to this result.\n\nContinued halvings\n\nOne factor that has continuously stood out for its major role in Bitcoin\u2019s price movements is its halving, i.e., the algorithmic event that cuts the previous reward for mining this Proof-of-Work (PoW) crypto in half, thus reducing the amount of BTC in circulation and increasing demand which, in turn, drives the price up. As it happens, Bitcoin has entered the final phase before its fourth halving earlier in May 2023.\n\nIndeed, the crypto community expects the next halving event for Bitcoin to take place in May 2024, and multiple crypto trading experts have voiced their opinion that the price of the maiden digital asset will surely skyrocket during that time, with pseudonymous analyst PlanB discussing several pricing models that could give it room to grow toward $1 million.\n\nIncreased institutional adoption\n\nFollowing the unexpected change in stance from Larry Fink, CEO of the world\u2019s largest asset manager BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), toward Bitcoin, doing a 360 from claiming that clients had \u201czero interest\u201d in crypto assets to openly embracing Bitcoin and becoming its enthusiastic supporter, the institutional interest in it has become more apparent.\n\nSpecifically, BlackRock\u2019s surprise application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in June has encouraged multiple other companies to follow the asset manager\u2019s example, starting a chain of Bitcoin ETF filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and triggering a massive Bitcoin price increase, which billionaire Mike Novogratz identified as a turning point.\n\nWider acceptance as payment method\n\nAt the same time, as Bitcoin becomes a more accepted payment method around the world, with increasingly more e-commerce and brick-and-mortar businesses introducing the option to pay via crypto for their products and/or services, and more Bitcoin ATMs springing in all corners of the globe, the increased acceptance could also drive up the demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nSpecifically, according to the statistics by the crypto ATM analytics platform Coin ATM Radar, there were 36,316 crypto ATMs and 236,756 other Bitcoin-to-cash and cash-to-Bitcoin service providers in 71 countries around the world, produced by 46 Bitcoin ATM manufacturers and installed by 515 Bitcoin machine operators, recording a continuous increase in installations.\n\nFavorable regulatory environment\n\nFurthermore, governments and regulators becoming more open and favorable towards Bitcoin, as evident in the example of the United Kindom\u2019s financial services minister, Andrew Griffith, rejecting the Treasury Committee\u2019s recommendation to regulate retail trading and investing in crypto as gambling, could also help drive up the price.\n\nAnother example of a crypto-friendly environment is Malta, an island country that has used cryptocurrencies for the longest time among all others, with several bills to make it the global leader in crypto regulation, and leading Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, to choose it over Japan, as it considered it more favorable than the East Asian country.\n\nEconomic situation\n\nFinally, amid a global economic crisis, many people could turn to Bitcoin as a safe haven asset, including Robert Kiyosaki, a renowned investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book \u2018Rich Dad Poor Dad,\u2019 who has recently strongly criticized the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) over the claims that the US economy was strong.\n\nAs more preferable assets to fiat money, particularly the US dollar, the finance educator has long advised his followers to buy gold, silver, and Bitcoin to survive the looming major financial depression and stock market crash, as well as predicting that the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization would hit $120,000 next year.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time changing hands at the price of $29,467, recording an increase of 1.76% on the day and gaining 0.88% across the previous week, whereas, on its monthly chart, it has witnessed a decline of 3.83%, according to the information retrieved on August 2.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAll things considered, when and if Bitcoin truly manages to reach the whopping price of $1 million is impossible to say but could depend on the above factors, either acting alone or coming together. Ultimately, the forces of supply and demand will be the ones to determine the actual price of the representative digital asset.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nMicroStrategy, a prominent software developer known for its substantial Bitcoin holdings, plans to raise $750 million by selling additional stock. The company aims to utilise the funds for various purposes, including acquiring more Bitcoin. Following the announcement, the price of Bitcoin experienced a noticeable rise.\n\nMicroStrategy's Chairman, Michael Saylor, has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin, leading the company to buy billions of dollars worth of the crypto since the onset of the pandemic. The company has previously utilised stock and equity sales to fund its Bitcoin purchases as part of its strategy. This latest move reaffirms their commitment to expanding their Bitcoin holdings.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, MicroStrategy holds an impressive 152,800 bitcoins, which translates to an approximate value of $4.5 billion. The decision to raise funds through stock sales aligns with the company's intention to bolster its crypto investments further.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaylor is confident that even if a spot Bitcoin ETF gains approval, MicroStrategy will remain an appealing option for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure. He believes the company's unique operating strategy differentiates it from traditional ETFs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a recent interview, Saylor likened the potential impact of a Bitcoin ETF approval to a \"supertanker\" and MicroStrategy to a \"sports car.\" He anticipates that the ETF's approval will attract more significant investments into the crypto space, primarily from large hedge funds.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite fluctuations in MicroStrategy's stock, Saylor remains optimistic about the firm's role in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The company's aggressive investment approach and the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF could reshape the crypto investment landscape, offering new opportunities for all market participants.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicroStrategy's immense influence in the crypto space is evident through its substantial Bitcoin holdings, and its commitment to acquire more coins underscores its confidence in the digital asset. With the potential influx of funds from the stock sale, MicroStrategy is well-positioned to remain a key player in the Bitcoin market.\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia.

        "title": "Could a Bitcoin bull run be triggered by Fitch's US credit rating downgrade? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "On Aug. 1, a significant event occurred within the financial world: Fitch, a reputable credit ratings agency, lowered the credit rating of the United States government from the pristine AAA to AA+. This downgrade signaled diminished confidence in the U.S. government\u2019s ability to handle its fiscal responsibilities effectively.\n\nThe downgrade nudged investors into a cautious stance, leading many to move their money out of assets like stocks, silver, oil and long-term bonds. Instead, they favored cash and short-term instruments, which are perceived as safer options in uncertain times.\n\nS&P 500 futures (blue), WTI oil futures (cyan), U.S. 20-year notes (yellow), silver (orange). Source: TradingView\n\nAs evident from the above chart, the reaction to Fitch\u2019s decision to downgrade the U.S. government\u2019s credit rating was broad-based, affecting commodities, fixed income and equities alike. This has implications for various financial institutions and investment portfolios, including Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nTraders are now contemplating if Bitcoin\u2019s digital scarcity and censorship resistance can offer refuge from the widespread \u201cflight to safety\u201d movement instigated by the deteriorating credit score of the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nThe downgrade had little impact on markets\n\nA Moody\u2019s Analytics report from May hinted at a potential domino effect, where a downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt could lead to further downgrades in the financial sector. Notably, only Fitch and S&P have marked U.S. debt as AA+, while Moody\u2019s still holds it at AAA with a stable outlook.\n\nInterestingly, the cost of insuring U.S. sovereign debt against default, as indicated by credit default swaps, has largely remained stable post-downgrade, a surprising development in the face of such significant news.\n\nU.S. 5-year Treasuries credit default swaps value. Source: World Government Bonds\n\nThis financial instrument protects against the risk of default on debt, working similarly to an insurance policy, where investors pay a premium to receive compensation if the issuer of the debt (in this case, the U.S. government) defaults.\n\nThis stability indicated that investors were not panicking about the immediate impact of the downgrade. A potential reason is that U.S. Treasurys are considered one of the safest investments globally because they are backed by the U.S. government. The issuer guarantees that it will repay the debt on the specified maturity date, including interest.\n\nU.S. 5-year Treasury yield, 12-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nNote that the recent daily yield fluctuations appear less significant given the five-year government note yield\u2019s consistent rise over the last two weeks. This can be linked to eroding investor confidence in U.S. debt management, prompting demand for higher yields.\n\nApart from the Treasurys' yield dynamics, a falling U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) \u2014 which gauges the U.S. dollar\u2019s value relative to other currencies \u2014 could spell trouble. If it leads to dwindling faith in traditional assets, investors might seek alternative stores of value, potentially boosting Bitcoin\u2019s appeal.\n\nU.S. Dollar Index (DXY). Source: TradingView\n\nIn the last two weeks, the DXY has risen from 99.50 to 102.60, implying a potential sentiment shift among investors. They might be moving away from Treasurys, equities and commodities to seek refuge in cash, highlighting the dollar\u2019s appeal during uncertainty.\n\nRelated: How will Bitcoin halving affect BTC price, and is DeFi dead?\n\nThe outlook for Bitcoin\u2019s price in the short term is negative\n\nThe resilience of credit default swaps for U.S. Treasurys and the strengthening dollar, as per the DXY, suggest that investors might be enhancing cash holdings in anticipation of market turmoil.\n\nConsequently, Bitcoin might not immediately thrive from the U.S. government\u2019s debt profile downgrade. The initial flight to liquidity often overlooks the benefits of decentralized assets during early market turbulence.\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s digital scarcity and fixed supply, it stands out as a valuable asset amid expanding government debt, which can depreciate cash. As a result, investors may increasingly consider Bitcoin a safe haven and a robust asset class that is resistant to censorship due to its decentralized nature.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "The chances of approval of a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States have now increased to 65% from a mere 1% just a couple of months ago.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart said in a recent statement that the chances of approval for a Bitcoin ETF have increased significantly over the past month, owing to various new developments around the crypto market and the refiling of ETF applications by the likes of BlackRock.\n\nSeyffart noted that a lot will depend on the timing of the Grayscale case dates and their recent boost in approval will depend on Grayscale\u2019s victory over the SEC in Federal court. He added that Grayscale\u2019s win against the SEC could set trigger a series of simultaneous approval for all spit Bitcoin ETF filings by the end of the fourth quarter later this year.\n\nThe lynchpin for this current thesis is a Grayscale victory over the SEC in Federal court. Which COULD set things up for a wave of SEC approvals sometime in the 4th quarter? All depends on how much Gensler wants to fight here. \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) August 2, 2023\n\nSeyffart believes that the BlackRock and the Coinbase surveillance sharing agreement (SSA) drastically changed the spot Bitcoin ETF analysis \u2014 not to mention the Ripple case, which is less important but still relevant. We will update our views and opinions as new information comes to light.\n\nRelated: Ether ETFs pending \u2014 Grayscale, VanEck and others file SEC applications\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF filing spree began with BlackRock\u2019s filing with the SEC on June 16. WisdomTree, Invesco and Valkyrie, along with several other institutional giants, followed suit. The recent slew of filings in the second quarter of 2023 comes despite the SEC rejecting all spot ETF filings earlier. Many market analysts believe 2023 could prove crucial for the spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF race has garnered attention from some of the biggest traditional financial institutions and analysts, while Balchunas believes that the interest of institutional giants like BlackRock could be the best possible chance for approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Elegant and ass-backward\u2019: Jameson Lopp\u2019s first impression of Bitcoin"

        "content": "In its Aug. 1 financial results, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy said it acquired substantial Bitcoin during Q2 2023.\n\nAndrew Kang, Chief Financial Officer at MicroStrategy, said:\n\n\u201cThe addition in the second quarter of 12,333 bitcoins [is] the largest increase in a single quarter since Q2 2021. We efficiently raised capital\u2026 and used cash from operations to continue to increase bitcoins on our balance sheet.\u201d\n\nIn a separate presentation, the firm said that the 12,333 BTC it bought was purchased for $347 million at an average of $28,136 per Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, those numbers only represent the company\u2019s latest additions, not the total amount of Bitcoin it acquired. MicroStrategy said that, as of July 31, 2023, it had acquired 152,800 BTC for $4.53 billion or $29,672 per Bitcoin.\n\nDespite those high estimates, the company said that the carrying value (the original cost of the asset, less any depreciation, amortization or impairment costs) of its Bitcoin was just $2.3 billion. That number reflects cumulative impairment losses of $2.196 billion since MicroStrategy\u2019s first purchase and an average carrying amount per Bitcoin of $15,251.\n\nMicroStrategy noted elsewhere that Bitcoin and its own MSTR stock have outperformed numerous other indexes and assets. MSTR has gained 254% since it adopted its Bitcoin strategy in August 2020, while Bitcoin itself has gained 145% since that date.\n\nMicroStrategy otherwise reported total revenues of $120.4 million in Q2 2023, which represents a 1% decrease in revenue year-over-year.\n\nBitcoin in the bigger picture\n\nKang also positioned MicroStrategy\u2019s purchases within broader industry developments, such as increasing interest from institutional investors and regulatory clarity around Bitcoin.\n\nKang also said that MicroStrategy is seeing progress regarding Bitcoin accounting practices. In May, the company submitted a letter to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) expressing support for a fair value accounting for crypto assets. It said this would allow it to provide a \u201cmore relevant view\u201d of its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nIn its company profile, Microstrategy called Bitcoin a \u201cdependable store of value\u201d and described Bitcoin acquisition as one of its two main strategies alongside its enterprise software business.\n\nUPDATE: Aug. 2, 2023, 9AM \u2013 MicroStrategy announced the sale of up to $750 million of its Class A stock on Aug. 1 potentially to fund additional Bitcoin purchases.\n\nMentioned in this article"

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nIn a recent twist of events, renowned financial expert and vocal critic of cryptocurrencies, Peter Schiff, took a direct shot at MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor over the company's Bitcoin holdings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Aug. 1, it was revealed that MicroStrategy had acquired an additional 467 BTC for $14.4 million, bringing their total Bitcoin stash to an impressive 152,800 BTC. The company's CEO, Michael Saylor, disclosed that they had acquired the digital assets for a total cost of $4.53 billion, averaging $29,672 per Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, it seems Schiff could not resist poking fun at Saylor's investment strategy. Seizing the opportunity to question the move, the expert confronted the MicroStrategy CEO, stating that the latest BTC purchase had already resulted in a 5% loss. He further inquired about the total losses that the company's shareholders had incurred since the company first ventured into the world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nSo you're already down 5% on that new $14.4 buy. How many billions have MSTR shareholders lost so far on the entire BTC position? \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) August 2, 2023\n\nDespite the direct challenge, Saylor has yet to respond to Schiff's query, a move that might not be too surprising for those familiar with Saylor's social media style.\n\nIs glass half full?\n\nAt present, Bitcoin's price is indeed trading slightly below MicroStrategy's average purchase price, but by just 2%. While this might seem like a cause for concern, it is essential to note that the company's investment in Bitcoin has yielded significant returns. Since MicroStrategy began buying Bitcoin for its treasury, MSTR shares have surged an astonishing 220% to their current value. At the peak, the growth skyrocketed to an impressive 965%, reaching an all-time high of $1,315 per share.\n\nWhile the recent dip in Bitcoin's value may have raised some eyebrows, MicroStrategy seems undeterred, displaying confidence in their digital asset strategy."

The post-merger mining potential of the two companies will reach 5.6 EH/s.\n\n\"We've been searching for the right partner to join us on our ambitious growth journey for some time and are confident that Hut 8 is the perfect fit,\" Michael Ho, the Co-Founder and CEO of US Bitcoin, said.\n\nThe company will utilize energy from a mix of zero-emission and renewable sources.

These included the cryptocurrency platform Luno, which reduced its staff by 35%, and the exchange Gemini, which decided to cut its workforce for the third time in nine months.\n\nMining companies are managing to produce more coins than before, even though the difficulty of mining has increased. Still, this guarantees much lower revenues due to low profitability at current prices. Northern Data has increased its production by 315% compared to last year, but this has not translated into better financial results in dollar terms.\n\nIn challenging market conditions, only the strongest can survive. Hence the decision by Hut 8 and US Bitcoin to merge seems perfectly logical. The question is if cryptocurrencies continue to remain cheap in the long term, whether this will lead to further industry consolidation."

The new detail was originally reported by CNBC on Thursday.\n\nThe couple appeared at a sentencing hearing today in Washington D.C.\n\nBitfinex Hackers Agree to Forfeit Billions in Bitcoin in Plea Deal\n\nDuring the court hearing, the Bitfinex hacker also admitted that he and his wife converted some of the stolen crypto assets to gold coins and buried them. According to CNBC\u2019s account of the hearing, Lichtenstein flew to Ukraine and Kazakhstan to convert the crypto to cash before depositing the funds in an American bank account.\n\nLichtenstein and Morgan (also known by her rapper name \"Razzlekhan\") were arrested early last year on charges of having laundered the funds stolen from Bitfinex in 2016. They could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nAs part of their plea deal, the couple has agreed to forfeit proceeds from the almost 120,000 Bitcoin they stand accused of laundering. At the time of their arrest, the Department of Justice seized $3.6 billion worth of Bitcoin it believed to be connected to the 2016 hack.\n\nAt the time, Deputy Attorney General Lisa O.

A few weeks before the plea deal was announced in July, Bitfinex recovered a small portion of the Bitcoin Cash, about $314 thousand, that was taken during the 2016 hack. But the majority of the funds still have not been returned to users.\n\nEditor's Note: This story was updated at 4 p.m. ET on Thursday, August 3 to add additional details about the hearing and context about the hack."

Yet the San Francisco-based firm\u2019s losses were less severe compared to a staggering $4.98 loss per share reported the same time in 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoinbase\u2019s second-quarter performance marked a dip compared to the previous one, when the exchange disclosed a loss of $0.34 per share on $773 million revenue. The exchange had built on positive momentum towards the end of 2022 despite the collapse of FTX and sinking crypto prices, growing revenue by 22% sequentially.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, Coinbase said the firm\u2019s strong quarter was driven in part by a continued push toward efficiency. The firm highlighted a 50% drop in its recurring operating expenses year-over-year, which includes slashing its headcount by 30% during that span.\n\n\u201cWe started this journey of being more financially disciplined about a year ago,\u201d Coinbase\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations Anil Gupta told Decrypt. \u201cThere's definitely headcount reductions, but there's also a lot more efficiency and optimization across the whole company.\"\n\nCoinbase took in $201 million in interest income during the second quarter, $151 of which came from its revenue-sharing agreement with Circle on USDC reserves. By the quarter\u2019s end, Coinbase said it had around $1.8 billion in USDC on its platform.\n\nCoinbase disclosed trading volume on its platform sank quarter-over-quarter by a substantial amount, to $92 billion from $145 billion. Compared to the same period a year ago, it represented a 57% decline from $217 billion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome analysts predicted this could be the first time that revenue from subscriptions and services\u2014which includes products like staking and interest income earned from assets backing the Circle-issued stablecoin USDC\u2014overtakes transaction revenue.\n\nCoinbase reported second-quarter transaction revenue of $327 million, notably down compared to $665 million a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions came in at $335 million, up from $147 million a year ago yet down from $361 million in the first quarter.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Coinbase during the second quarter. The agency accused the firm of failing to register as a securities exchange and broker, claiming its staking products constituted unregistered securities as well.\n\nBut Wall Street has largely shrugged off regulatory concerns. Coinbase shares were trading at $90.75 when markets closed on Thursday, up from $52\u2014roughly 75%\u2014since the SEC filed its lawsuit against the company on June 6.\n\nStill, it doesn\u2019t hurt that BlackRock seems to have faith in the San Francisco-based crypto exchange. The monolithic asset manager tapped Coinbase as a custodian for its spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, later revising its filing to include the exchange in a surveillance-sharing agreement as it vies against other firms in a race to get a spot Bitcoin ETF approved by the SEC."

        "title": "What is Metcalfe's Law, and why does it matter? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Metcalfe\u2019s Law in crypto Metcalfe\u2019s Law is a fundamental principle used to comprehend the network effect of communication systems such as cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks. Metcalfe\u2019s Law was first used in the telecommunications industry, and has subsequently been applied to several social and technological networks. Metcalfe\u2019s Law was created by Robert Metcalfe, the co-inventor of Ethernet, and is used to assess the importance and influence of networks based on the number of connections between its users. According to the law, a network\u2019s value is directly inversely proportional to the square of its users or nodes: In the context of cryptocurrencies, Metcalfe\u2019s Law indicates that as a network\u2019s users or players expand in number, so do the network\u2019s value and utility. This is because, in a decentralized network, more users mean more potential for transactions, interactions, and network effects, which in turn can lead to greater adoption and value appreciation of the cryptocurrency. According to this law, the value of a cryptocurrency network increases not linearly with the number of users but quadratically. Moreover, the adoption and practical applications of a cryptocurrency network determine its worth. The more users who find value in using the cryptocurrency for various purposes, the more robust the network's growth potential is. Metcalfe's Law also suggests that the size of the network affects the native token's value. As more users utilize the token for transactions, investments, or other purposes, the demand for the token may increase, potentially leading to price appreciation.\n\nTypes of network effects in crypto Several types of network effects are observed in the crypto space, each contributing to the growth and value of a cryptocurrency network. Various types of network effects in crypto are explained below: The user adoption network effect, which occurs as more users join a cryptocurrency network, increases the network\u2019s value and utility, draws in more users, and is one of the main network effects. An example is Bitcoin (BTC), with its status cemented by its broad acceptance as the industry\u2019s preeminent cryptocurrency. The developer network effect, based on a vibrant development community, is another crucial aspect. A cryptocurrency project can benefit from ongoing technology developments, security upgrades and creative uses when it attracts many developers, increasing its appeal to consumers and investors. With a sizable developer community behind its extensive ecosystem of decentralized apps and smart contracts, Ethereum stands out in this regard. The security network effect emphasizes the significance of a large number of miners or validators participating in a network since security is of the utmost importance in the crypto realm. As more miners are added, PoW-based cryptocurrencies like BTC become more secure, preserving the integrity of the blockchain and the transactions that take place there. Interoperability and alliances also help create network effects. Partnerships with other initiatives, businesses, or organizations can increase cryptocurrency\u2019s utility, adoption and visibility. This has been a reality for Ripple\u2019s XRP (XRP) thanks to partnerships with financial institutions that have allowed it to be incorporated into cross-border payment solutions. Similarly, interoperability between blockchains helps cryptocurrencies gain additional users and ecosystem projects. An example is Polkadot, boasting over 150 projects built on its platform, providing a seamless communication bridge between diverse blockchains.\n\nWhy does Metcalfe\u2019s Law matter in crypto? Metcalfe\u2019s Law is an essential concept in the crypto space, as it highlights the significance of network adoption, decentralization, the network effect, market valuation, scalability, security and utility. Network adoption and value Metcalfe\u2019s Law, which highlights the significance of network adoption, is particularly relevant in the crypto realm. A cryptocurrency network\u2019s value increases nonlinearly as more people join it. This increase in value has the potential to draw more users, creating a beneficial feedback cycle. Decentralization Metcalfe\u2019s Law supports the idea that a larger, more widely dispersed network is more secure and resistant to attacks. This is true for decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The risk of single points of failure or control decreases as the network gets more decentralized due to the growth of nodes. Network effects Metcalfe\u2019s Law illustrates the importance of network effects. It motivates initiatives and groups to put their efforts into attracting sizable, engaged user populations. A cryptocurrency\u2019s utility increases with the number of users, increasing its appeal to new users and investors. Market valuation Investors and analysts can assess cryptocurrency projects more effectively by being aware of Metcalfe\u2019s Law. A network with more members is likely to have a higher intrinsic value, which might affect stock market sentiment and investment choices. Scalability and competition As networks get bigger, scalability becomes more important. The capacity of a blockchain may be strained by high transaction volumes and rising user activity. The performance and user experience of the network must be maintained; hence projects must take effective scaling solutions into account. Tokens and utility Metcalfe\u2019s Law highlights that the services, goods or advantages that Metcalfe\u2019s Law highlights that the services, goods or advantages that utility tokens offer to their user base determine the value of those tokens. The token increases in value as more users decide that utilizing it is worthwhile."

        "title": "Bitcoin, a \"duty of care\" and lex situs - Taylor Wessing",
        "content": "The Court of Appeal recently permitted the appeal of the High Court decision in Tulip Trading v Van der Laan and Ors [2022] EWHC 667 (Ch), on the basis the case advanced a serious issue to be tried. This allows the Court of Appeal to now consider the potential application of a duty of care in relation to bitcoin, which if applied would represent a significant development in this area. It also raises issues of jurisdiction and lex situs over assets that do not, by their nature, have an easily identifiable jurisdiction.\n\nWhat is the case about?\n\nTulip Trading Limited (Tulip) (a Seychelles company) stated that it suffered a loss of $4.5 billion in bitcoin following a hack on the computer of its owner and the stealing of private keys (knowledge of which confers practical control over the asset), which resulted in Tulip being unable to access the bitcoin. The UK nexus is provided by it being the long term residence of Dr Craig Wright, CEO and indirect owner of Tulip, and according to reports, an individual who has claimed, in the past, to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of bitcoin.\n\nTulip issued proceedings against the source code developers of the bitcoin (the Developers) alleging that the Developers had breached fiduciary and tortious duties owed to Tulip and seeking to force the Developers to implement a software patch to negate the alleged fraud/hack, which would result in the return of the \"stolen\" bitcoin to Tulip. The Developers are all resident outside the jurisdiction of England and Wales and Tulip obtained permission to serve proceedings upon them.\n\nTulip asserts that it owns (but has no control over) the bitcoin that was stolen in the hack. Tulip claims that the Developers should assist with the recovery of these assets, as it is within their power to do so. There is no submission or suggestion that the Developers had anything to do with the hack. The Developers assert that their assumption of the duties suggested by Tulip would be unworkable and unduly onerous.\n\nWhat happened in the High Court case?\n\nMrs Justice Falk in the High Court ruled in March 2020 that Tulip had no realistic prospect of proving that the Developers owed them any fiduciary or tortious duties, on the facts as presented. The following issues were discussed:\n\nImposition of fiduciary or tortious duties: Falk J noted that there is an arguable case that Tulip did own the bitcoin and that a hack occurred, but that this was not a strong enough link to impose fiduciary duties on the Developers.\n\nTortious duty: Falk J rejected the thought pattern that the Developers, in their role as developers of a network, should have created software to reverse a hack on the basis the creation of such software would not be intended to address a defect, but instead to impose changes on how the network was intended to work. Falk J considered the imposition of a duty in relation to failures to make changes to how the networks work would go beyond an extension of the current law in relation to tort. Falk J also noted that Tulip could have taken other steps (e.g. insurance of the cryptocurrency or the retention of multiple copies of the private key in multiple locations) to mitigate its own risk in relation to this.\n\nFalk J rejected the thought pattern that the Developers, in their role as developers of a network, should have created software to reverse a hack on the basis the creation of such software would not be intended to address a defect, but instead to impose changes on how the network was intended to work. Falk J considered the imposition of a duty in relation to failures to make changes to how the networks work would go beyond an extension of the current law in relation to tort. Falk J also noted that Tulip could have taken other steps (e.g. insurance of the cryptocurrency or the retention of multiple copies of the private key in multiple locations) to mitigate its own risk in relation to this. Fiduciary duty: Falk J noted the requirement of undivided loyalty in a fiduciary relationship and noted that the steps the Developers would have had to take would have to have been for Tulip's benefit only.\n\nAppropriate forum for trial: Falk J concluded that, given there was no realistic prospect of establishing that the Developers owed any tortious duty to Tulip, there was no serious issue to be tried on the merits of the case and, therefore, no need to consider the question of service of proceedings outside of the jurisdiction. In any event, Falk J was satisfied that, had this case proceeded to court, England would have been an appropriate forum. This is an interesting statement regarding jurisdiction over assets that, by design, do not have an easily identifiably jurisdiction.\n\nCourt of Appeal\n\nEarlier this year, in Tulip Trading v Van der Laan [2023] EWCA Civ 83, the Court of Appeal unanimously decided to allow Tulip's appeal of the High Court decision, reversing Mrs Justice Falk's earlier order indicating that, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, there is a serious issue to be tried, and also accepting that the courts of England do have jurisdiction.\n\nThis was not a trial in itself (that is set for 2024), but an order to allow the appeal to go to trial. Lord Justice Birss notes that Mrs Justice Falk's rationale that the courts of England had jurisdiction relied on the reasoning (the summary of which is detailed in paragraph 7 of the judgment) which states that: [t]here was no dispute that the cryptocurrency in issue was property \u2026 there was a good arguable case that Tulip was resident in the jurisdiction (despite being a Seychelles incorporated company) and that the property was located [in England].\n\nTherefore, Birss LJ comments (in the same paragraph) that: \"[t]he property gateway 11 (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 6B) (Gateway 11) was satisfied. For similar reasons gateway 9(a) (damage within the jurisdiction) was satisfied (paragraphs 159-164). In terms of forum, the conclusion (paragraph 168) was that there was no other jurisdiction with which the dispute had a closer link than England, or was even arguably the proper forum.\" References to Gateway 11 are explained below.\n\nSitus \u2013 jurisdiction\n\nThe overwhelming majority of international legal systems have some concept of situs for cross-border disputes. The asset type often determines how to determine its situs, with the law having developed over time to address this point in relation to different types of asset that have come into commercial use. The determination of situs is a much easier task in relation to tangible property as the country in which the asset is located is easily identified and apparent to third parties. An artificial location may be allocated to intangible property; often the place in which control over the asset is exercised, but this is an uncertain area and often difficult to ascertain.\n\nWhat are the rules on situs for immovable property, movable property and shares?\n\nGateway 11, mentioned above, gives jurisdiction to English courts where assets are physically located in England and Wales. Beyond that, rules have evolved in relation to different types of asset as discussed below:\n\nImmovable real assets: there is likely to be no challenge to where that asset is located.\n\nthere is likely to be no challenge to where that asset is located. Movable property: as discussed in Dicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws (16th ed), during the 19th Century the law moved on to determine that movable tangibles should be governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the owner's domicile. This also made sense as these types of transfer were common for inheritance or marriage, with land still being the primary valuable asset.\n\nas discussed in Dicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws (16th ed), during the 19th Century the law moved on to determine that movable tangibles should be governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the owner's domicile. This also made sense as these types of transfer were common for inheritance or marriage, with land still being the primary valuable asset. Shares: A share could be regarded as being situated in the location of where the register of members is kept. There may however be multiple registers in multiple countries. Where registers are kept in different countries, a court may look at the place where such shares are effectively dealt with between the company and a shareholder \u2013 if there are competing claims to jurisdiction, a court will need to decide jurisdiction on rational grounds (R v Williams [1942 ] AC 541 (Privy Council, per Viscount Maugham)).\n\nCryptoassets and situs\n\nChallenging questions are posed when trying to determine the situs of a crypto-asset \u2013 a product that, by its inherent nature and design, exists everywhere and nowhere all at once. There are no straightforward answers, but options are available as we discuss below. One question that is particularly relevant in considering the question of situs, is what the proprietary status of cryptoassets is, given their novel characteristics which distinguish them from other assets. The UK Jurisdictional Taskforce considered those features and confirmed in their Legal Statement on Cryptoassets and Smart Contracts in 2019 (the 2019 Statement) that cryptoassets possess all of the characteristics of property set out in the relevant authorities and that cryptoassets are therefore to be treated, in principle, as property.\n\nWhat are the options?\n\nIn recent years, HMRC has commented that the situs of the crypto-asset should be the residency of the beneficial owner (as per its December 2019 guidance).\n\nThe Society of Trust and Estates Practitioners (STEP), a private body for practitioners, published a guidance note in September 2021, differing in approach from that of HMRC. STEP's view is that: \"its location should be linked to the location of the private key or of the person who has control of the private key (who may or may not be the beneficial owner)\".\n\nThe UK Jurisdictional Taskforce's confirmation that cryptoassets are a form of property under English law suggests that a crypto-asset must have a location assigned to it notwithstanding its inherent design to be locationless. This is a paradox that needs further understanding. The 2019 Statement suggests that the following factors might be relevant in determining whether English and Welsh law governs the proprietary aspects of dealings in cryptoassets (in no particular order):\n\nwhether any relevant off chain asset is located in England and Wales\n\nwhether there is any centralised control in England and Wales\n\nwhether a particular cryptoasset is controlled by a particular participant in England and Wales (for example due to a private key being stored here)\n\nwhether the law applicable to the relevant transfer (perhaps by reason of the parties' choice) is English law.\n\nWhat about an artificial situs?: A further option would be the imposition of an artificial situs on a crypto-asset by following the English law legal position on non cryptoassets.\n\nIn a similar way to a share, cryptoassets rely on a form of register to document transfers: it is not therefore inconceivable that a crypto-asset may be categorised as a registered asset as all transactions will be recorded on the relevant register or blockchain.\n\nTulip's argument centres on the fact the Developers are those who are responsible for the underlying source code for the commercial banking ledgers as set out in the bitcoin protocol/ledger. It is not a huge leap to put forward the possibility that the crypto-asset could, given the control the Developers have, be situated in the jurisdiction of the Developers. This goes against every previous form of asset class under English law, but that does not necessarily mean it is incorrect \u2013 crypto as a concept is unlike any asset class ever examined before and it may well be that common law will need to adapt to its unique characteristics. This does however raise the possibility that a foreign court may reject any ruling of an English court, on the analysis that the English courts did not have jurisdiction in the first place.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this will be addressed in the Court of Appeal case \u2013 if it is, the reasoning could move forward the current law on localisation of assets and may well be a welcome guide when considering this point in future cases \u2013 that being said, this appears to be an incredibly complicated issue and there are a number of pitfalls that need to be overcome both in this jurisdiction and internationally on this question.\n\nOwnership and remedies\n\nAside from the complicated situs arguments, the question of who owns the cryptocurrency needs to be resolved. Logically, it makes sense that the ownership would need to be the first point the Court of Appeal need to decide. If the Court of Appeal determines that Tulip are not the true owners, then it is unlikely that the English courts would have jurisdiction on the case.\n\nWho are the potential owners?\n\nTulip: Tulip has asserted it is the owner of the lost cryptocurrency, however this has not been definitively determined. It has not added any third parties to its claim and asserts that it is the legal owner, despite this never being proven in a court of law. Tulip's claim to ownership would need to be analysed by a court, applying legal and equitable principles in the context of crypto.\n\nTulip has asserted it is the owner of the lost cryptocurrency, however this has not been definitively determined. It has not added any third parties to its claim and asserts that it is the legal owner, despite this never being proven in a court of law. Tulip's claim to ownership would need to be analysed by a court, applying legal and equitable principles in the context of crypto. The person who has access to the private key: STEP's approach would result in the person who has access to the private key being the owner. This would not be Tulip. The hack, albeit \"illegally\", has removed its access to the private key. The private key may therefore now be in the possession of the hacker and that person could, therefore, be considered to be the owner.\n\nSTEP's approach would result in the person who has access to the private key being the owner. This would not be Tulip. The hack, albeit \"illegally\", has removed its access to the private key. The private key may therefore now be in the possession of the hacker and that person could, therefore, be considered to be the owner. A bona fide purchaser for value without notice: Mrs Justice Falk noted that there could be rival claims to ownership from a third party who has no prior knowledge of the hack. The hacked cryptocurrency could be in the possession of a bona fide third party purchaser for value without notice. If this is the case, that purchaser may well be fall into an equitable maxim and be referred to as \"Equity's Darling\". In such a case, the court would need to decide how to deal with this, as equitable rights bind the entire world, save Equity's Darling. Were a court to agree that the Developers owe fiduciary duties, and determine the true owner to be Equity's Darling, those fiduciary duties would be owed to Equity's Darling and not to Tulip.\n\nConcluding thought\n\nBy allowing the case to go before the Court of Appeal, it is possible that the Court of Appeal may find that developers owe a duty of care to their users in the crypto space, which would be a distinguishing development in tort law. Practically speaking (and for the everyday person who has crypto), it may also offer additional protections to the consumer, in a space that (currently) offers very little protection. That being said there is no guarantee of Tulip's success in the court case and Lord Justice Birss commented that any victory by Tulip would involve a significant development of the common law of fiduciary duties. This is a case to watch out for in 2024 not only to in relation to the law on fiduciary duties, but also in relation to the lex situs of cryptoassets and, therefore, the location of competent courts.\n\nFind out more\n\nTo discuss the issues raised in this article in more detail, please contact a member of our Banking and Finance team."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) saw a significant resurgence over the past few hours after hitting the lowest price since June 21 at $28,641 yesterday. At press time, BTC has experienced a 3.7% hike from its low. In fact, BTC even brushed past the $30,000 mark, indicating a substantial shift in market sentiment. So, the question begs.\n\nWhy Is Bitcoin Up Today?\n\n\u201cThe entire short build-up of the past couple days just got wiped,\u201d tweeted analyst Byzantine General. Data from Coinglass backs this claim and shows that BTC short positions amounting to $27.8 million were liquidated yesterday, followed by an additional $13.45 million today. This accounts for the most significant short liquidation since July 14, undeniably playing a significant role in the current price movement.\n\nBut perhaps the most influential reason for the sudden shift in market sentiment was MicroStrategy\u2019s recent announcement. The company stated that it will conduct stock sales worth $750 million. After the announcement, the Bitcoin community was abuzz with speculation that Michael Saylor might make additional, gigantic BTC purchases.\n\n\u201cAs with prior programs, we may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which include the purchase of Bitcoin as well as the repurchase or repayment of our outstanding debt,\u201d said Andrew Kang, MicroStrategy\u2019s CFO during a recent earnings call. While it remains unclear if the entire proceeds will be funneled into Bitcoin, the likelihood of a substantial chunk is certain. Directly after this announcement, Bitcoin surged by 1.6% within one hour.\n\nOn-chain analysis firm Santiment tweeted: \u201cBitcoin has breached back above $30k once again, with assistance from the many traders who capitulated during the past week of price declines. Volume is rising to kick off August, & this psychological resistance cross may shift sentiment positive.\u201d\n\nThe chart shared by the firm shows that yesterday trading volume picked up steam again, rising to the highest level since six weeks. Also, the lowest amount of profit / loss taking in 7 months indicates a capitulation event.\n\nAnalyst @52Skew added that the Bitcoin on the Binance spot market experienced a \u201creal spot demand\u201d which he wanted to see for a strong price reaction. \u201cNote the limit bid wall that pushed up price; typical with PvP conditions to force limit chasing. Marked notable liquidity on the orderbook,\u201d the analyst stated.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nHowever, he also cautioned that the 4-hour chart is so far looking like a classic Swing Failure Pattern (SFP) into a higher time-frame support / resistance. The Swing Failure Pattern, or SFP, is a type of reversal pattern where traders target stop-losses above a key swing low or below a key swing high to manipulate the price direction by generating enough liquidity.\n\nNevertheless, the market appears to be brimming with anticipation. As per @DaanCrypto: \u201cIf price starts ranging here I\u2019d look for another sweep of the lows and consolidation there. $28.5 & 29.5K are the areas of interest.\u201d Meanwhile, a break above the resistance zone at the monthly and weekly open between $29,236 and $29,300 would validate a bullish scenario where the price targets $30,000.\n\nAt press time, BTC wasn\u2019t able to reclaim the red resistance zone and was trading at $29,606.\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara /Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "When Was Bitcoin Created? Exploring the Origins of Cryptocurrency - Bitcoin Australia",
        "content": "Born from a desire to take control away from central banks and governments, Bitcoin\u2019s fascinating origins are a blend of technology, economics, and a dash of mystery. Whether you\u2019re looking to invest or just curious about what all the buzz is about, let\u2019s dive into the world of Bitcoin and explore how it all began!\n\nShort Summary\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as a decentralised digital currency using blockchain technology.\n\nIts creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, envisioned it to give users more control over their finances than traditional financial systems.\n\nBitcoin has achieved major milestones and is now widely accepted but continues to face challenges such as environmental impact & price volatility that will determine its future.\n\nContents\n\nThe Birth of Bitcoin\n\nThink of the day Bitcoin was born as the beginning of a whole new world of money. Before 2009, you had to rely on physical cash or bank accounts for buying things or saving your allowance. Then came Bitcoin, a digital currency you can send over the internet, almost like sending an email, but with money! It\u2019s like having a special kind of online piggy bank that no one controls except you. Sounds cool, right? Let\u2019s find out how it all started and what went into creating this virtual currency.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Vision\n\nBehind Bitcoin\u2019s creation was a mysterious figure (or maybe even a group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi had a dream of a world where money wasn\u2019t controlled by banks or governments. Instead, people could send and receive money directly, without anyone else getting in the way or taking a piece of the pie. Satoshi wrote a paper explaining how it would work and shared it online. Imagine a community where everyone can trust each other without needing a middleman like a bank. That was Satoshi\u2019s vision, and it laid the groundwork for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Genesis Block\n\nOn January 3, 2009, Satoshi made the dream real by creating the very first block of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, known as the \u201cGenesis Block.\u201d This block is like the first page in a digital ledger that records every single Bitcoin transaction. Inside this Genesis Block, Satoshi left a hidden message: \u201cThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d It\u2019s a bit like a secret note, hinting at the financial crisis and why Bitcoin was so important. This Genesis Block was the beginning of Bitcoin\u2019s public ledger, a chain of blocks that grew as more people started using this new kind of money. It\u2019s a trail of digital breadcrumbs that ensures everything is fair and above board. No one can cheat or mess with the records, and that\u2019s part of what makes Bitcoin so unique and exciting!\n\nUnderstanding Blockchain Technology\n\nYou know how in school, you often work on group projects where everyone can add their own ideas, but there\u2019s only one paper or presentation at the end? Blockchain technology is kind of like that, but for money and information. Imagine a shared online notebook that everyone can see and add to, but no one can erase or change what\u2019s already been written. This notebook keeps track of every Bitcoin transaction, and it\u2019s protected by some super-smart math and computer rules. Sounds intriguing, doesn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s dig into what makes this technology so special.\n\nDecentralised Ledger\n\nMost of us are used to having our money stored in a bank, right? The bank keeps track of everything, and we trust them to get it right. But in the world of Bitcoin, there\u2019s no one central bank or company in charge. Instead, the information is spread out across a network of computers all around the world. This is called a \u201cdecentralised ledger.\u201d It\u2019s like having the group project stored on everyone\u2019s computer, not just the teacher\u2019s. If one computer gets it wrong or tries to cheat, the others can catch it. This way, it\u2019s really hard for anyone to mess with the system.\n\nMining and Proof of Work\n\nNow, you might be wondering how new Bitcoins are made and how transactions get added to this shared notebook. That\u2019s where \u201cmining\u201d comes in. It\u2019s not about digging in the ground but solving complex mathematical puzzles using powerful computers. Think of it as a mega-challenging video game where the winners get rewarded with new Bitcoins. Miners, as they\u2019re called, confirm transactions and keep the network secure. It\u2019s like a competition to see who can finish the math homework first, and the winners get a golden star \u2013 or in this case, some shiny new Bitcoins!\n\nBut how do we make sure that these miners aren\u2019t cheating or taking shortcuts in their quest for Bitcoins? This is where \u201cProof of Work\u201d comes into play. It\u2019s a system that makes solving those math puzzles really hard and time-consuming, but easy to check once they\u2019re solved. Kind of like a teacher checking your answers in a math test. You\u2019ve got to show your work to prove you got it right! This Proof of Work ensures that miners are honest, and it keeps the whole Bitcoin system safe and reliable. It\u2019s the rulebook for the game, making sure everyone plays fair and square.\n\nEvolution of Bitcoin\u2019s Popularity\n\nRemember the first time you heard about Bitcoin? Maybe it was just a buzzword on the news, or perhaps a friend wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it. Either way, it\u2019s grown into something pretty huge! It\u2019s like that underground band that suddenly everyone knows about and loves. Starting from a small group of tech-savvy enthusiasts, Bitcoin has exploded in popularity, becoming a global phenomenon. Curious to know how this digital currency went from an obscure idea to a household name? Let\u2019s take a trip down memory lane!\n\nEarly Adoption and Growth\n\nIn the beginning, Bitcoin was like a secret club for computer geeks and people who really cared about privacy. It was created in 2009, but for the first couple of years, not many people knew or cared about it. Slowly, online stores started accepting Bitcoin, and some people began using it to buy stuff or even as an investment. It was like discovering a cool new hobby that only a few people knew about. Over time, more and more people started to see the value in this new kind of money, and its popularity began to grow.\n\nMajor Milestones\n\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s popularity grew, it reached some pretty exciting milestones. In 2010, someone bought two pizzas with Bitcoin, marking the first time it was used to buy something in the real world! Then, in late 2013, Bitcoin\u2019s price soared past $1,000 for the first time. More recently, big companies started accepting Bitcoin, and governments have begun to recognise it. It\u2019s even been traded on major stock exchanges through ETF products. Each of these milestones shows how Bitcoin has become more accepted and mainstream.\n\nChallenges and Criticisms\n\nYou know how even the coolest new video game or the latest blockbuster movie might have some flaws? Well, Bitcoin, despite being an exciting innovation, has its own set of challenges and criticisms. It\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows in the world of digital currency. Just like when your favorite band releases a song that\u2019s not quite a hit, Bitcoin has faced some issues that have people talking and debating. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the bumps in the road that Bitcoin has come across, like its impact on the environment and the wild rollercoaster ride of its price.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\nBitcoin mining, that computer-powered puzzle-solving we talked about earlier, takes a whole lot of energy. In fact, it uses up more electricity than some entire countries! Picture all the gaming consoles in the world running non-stop, and you\u2019ll get an idea of how much power it takes. This has led to concerns about the impact on the environment, especially if the energy comes from sources that aren\u2019t so green. It\u2019s like leaving all the lights on in your house 24/7; it\u2019s not great for the planet. Some people are working on making Bitcoin more eco-friendly, but it\u2019s still a big issue that divides opinions.\n\nPrice Volatility\n\nHave you ever been on a rollercoaster that goes up and down so much it makes your head spin? That\u2019s what the price of Bitcoin can be like. One day it\u2019s skyrocketing, and the next day, it might drop dramatically. This wild ride makes it exciting for some but nerve-wracking for others. This price volatility makes it tricky for people to use Bitcoin like regular money or even as an investment. It\u2019s like trying to play a game with ever-changing rules, and not everyone\u2019s comfortable with that.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has had an incredible journey so far, full of highs, lows, twists, and turns, but what\u2019s going to happen in the future? Will it become the money of tomorrow, or is it just a trend that might fade away? The future of Bitcoin is like an unwritten book, filled with possibilities. Let\u2019s explore some of the chapters that might unfold, like how it could grow to handle more people and what governments might have to say about it.\n\nScalability Solutions\n\nRight now, Bitcoin can only handle a limited number of transactions at once. Imagine your favorite online game server crashing because too many players are trying to join. That\u2019s the challenge Bitcoin faces as it becomes more popular. But don\u2019t worry, some really smart people are working on solutions to make Bitcoin\u2019s system bigger and faster without losing what makes it special. This might include new technologies and updates that help it handle more transactions, like adding extra lanes to a highway. If they can crack this problem, it could be a game-changer for how we use money in the future.\n\nRegulatory Landscape\n\nGovernments and regulators around the globe are trying to figure out how Bitcoin fits into existing laws and what new rules might be needed. Some countries are welcoming Bitcoin with open arms, while others are more cautious. How governments decide to regulate (or not regulate) Bitcoin could have a big impact on how it grows, who uses it, and even what it\u2019s worth. This legal landscape is a bit like navigating a maze, and it\u2019s a crucial part of what the future might hold for this exciting digital currency.\n\nSummary\n\nSo there you have it, the story of Bitcoin, a virtual currency that started as a dream in the mind of a mysterious creator and grew into a global sensation. From its birth and the groundbreaking technology behind it, to its rise in popularity and the challenges it faces, Bitcoin has truly carved out a place in our modern world. Whether it\u2019s the excitement of mining, the debates over its environmental impact, or the curious future it holds, Bitcoin is more than just a buzzword. It\u2019s a glimpse into a future where money might work differently, a thrilling and sometimes puzzling ride that we all get to watch, and maybe even be a part of. Just like a gripping novel or a thrilling movie, Bitcoin\u2019s story isn\u2019t over, and who knows what the next chapter might hold?\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWho is the creator of Bitcoin?\n\nThe creator of Bitcoin is known as Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for a person or group that remains anonymous. In 2008, Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper, introducing the concept of blockchain technology, a decentralised and secure way to conduct peer-to-peer digital currency transactions. This innovation, free from third-party intervention, paved the way for the creation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat is the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining?\n\nBitcoin mining\u2019s environmental impact is a significant concern due to its high energy consumption. The process requires substantial computational power, resulting in considerable carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming. The need for sustainable solutions to reduce the environmental footprint of Bitcoin mining is crucial for the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies. Efforts are underway to find eco-friendly alternatives that maintain the security features of Bitcoin while lowering power consumption.\n\nWhat is the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin?\n\nThe regulatory landscape for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is evolving as governments and regulators work to strike a balance between encouraging innovation and protecting consumers. Measures such as KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols, Anti-Money Laundering regulations, and specific crypto asset legislation are being implemented worldwide. These regulations are designed to control the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, ensuring customer safety while fostering the growth of this groundbreaking financial technology."

        "title": "Commodity expert warns Bitcoin may be in trouble; Here's why - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "With the price of Bitcoin (BTC) demonstrating a largely sideways movement trend over the last seven days, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Mike McGlone has expressed concern over the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset underperforming.\n\nSpecifically, McGlone stated that Bitcoin seems alone under the radar of the United States regulatory crackdown, which means that it should be outperforming most risk assets, but it isn\u2019t, as he explained in a social media post shared on August 2.\n\nBitcoin acting out of order\n\nAccording to the analyst, \u201cin decline vs. the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index since the 2021 peak and April bounce, waning Bitcoin may presage rising headwinds for itself and the broad crypto market. \u201d Furthermore, he noted, if the asset \u201cfulfills what some consider the fastest-horse-in-the-race mantra, it seems logical Bitcoin should outperform in an everything bull market,\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nAs he further specified, Bloomberg\u2019s graphic indicates this might be taking place due to \u201cthe most aggressive liquidity pull from central banks in history\u201d and the Federal Reserve \u201ctightening in the third quarter despite the producer price index finished-goods gauge at minus 3.1% and dropping from 2022\u2019s 18.3% peak at its fastest pace since 1948.\u201d\n\nAccording to McGlone, Bitcoin could be sniffing out the above factors and responding to them. Moreover, he also stressed that both the Nasdaq and Bitcoin were up just over 20% on a one-year basis but that the maiden crypto asset\u2019s volatility was about two times higher.\n\nBitcoin/Nasdaq index vs. federal funds future. Source: Mike McGlone\n\nBitcoin versus other assets\n\nEarlier in May, McGlone shared his expectation that gold was likely to demonstrate dominance and continue to outperform Bitcoin in the following months when the precious metal sought to attain new highs, as highlighted by the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio at the time.\n\nIn June, he noted that Bitcoin was facing its first recession and a potential equity bear market in the US, as it trails the recent Nasdaq Index gains and was under the effect of federal funds futures that were \u201cshowing little potential for additional liquidity fuel,\u201d and that the approval of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) would not shield it from the consequences.\n\nMore recently, the commodities expert voiced his opinion that the second half of 2023 could \u201cdefine the benchmark crypto as a high-beta version of the stock market, or for its potential to be digital gold in a world going that way,\u201d as Finbold reported on July 7.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nIn the meantime, Bitcoin was changing hands at the price of $29,486, which represents a 2.20% gain in the last 24 hours and an increase of 1.09% across the previous seven days, although it is recording a loss of 3.78% on its monthly chart, as the recent data indicates.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMeanwhile, crypto trading expert Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe has stated there might be a case for Bitcoin declining to $12,000 or retesting at the lows, but that a similar situation had occurred in 2019 when indicators suggested that Bitcoin had to retest $3,000 and go to $2,000 when it was trending up.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
