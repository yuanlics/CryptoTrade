        "title": "What's the Future of Bitcoin? Here Are the Best, Worst, and Most Likely Scenarios. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC 1.17%) is many things, but you can never call it boring. The oldest, largest, and most mature cryptocurrency is still finding its sea legs in the market, rolling through roughly equal amounts of good news and bad.\n\nThe road ahead is as murky as ever. As I write this, Bitcoin's market price stands 62% below the all-time high of November 2021. At the same time, Bitcoin has tripled in three years and gained 1,500% in six years. About half the value of the total crypto market comes from Bitcoin alone. So there are plenty of Bitcoin bulls out there, but also lots of bearish investors.\n\nSo where is Bitcoin headed in the long run? Let's consider the best of all possible outcomes, the ultimate bear case, and then find a more realistic middle ground between those extremes.\n\nA Bitcoin bonanza: The best-case scenario\n\nBitcoin maximalists, like MicroStrategy (MSTR 10.85%) chairman Michael Saylor, believe that Bitcoin is the future of money. He expects the price to go up \"forever,\" with some volatility along the way but a reliably positive trend in the long run. So MicroStrategy has converted most of its cash reserves into Bitcoin and keeps buying more whenever it finds more spare cash to invest. In Saylor's view, that's the only reasonable way to manage your company's cash in the long run.\n\nSo what will it take to fulfill Mr. Saylor's ultra-bullish dreams of massive price gains? Well, let's imagine a world where absolutely everything works out in Bitcoin's favor:\n\nGlobal adoption: From Starbucks SBUX -0.85% ) Tesla TSLA -4.54% ) Bought it with Bitcoin. That new electric car? Yep, Tesla charged me in Bitcoin.\n\nFrom Bought it with Bitcoin. That new electric car? Yep, Tesla charged me in Bitcoin. Government approval: Governments worldwide not only tolerate Bitcoin but actively promote its use, ushering in a new era of supportive regulations and acceptance. Since this is the tip-top ideal outcome, we'd even see most countries adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, like El Salvador did two years ago.\n\nGovernments worldwide not only tolerate Bitcoin but actively promote its use, ushering in a new era of supportive regulations and acceptance. Since this is the tip-top ideal outcome, we'd even see most countries adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, like El Salvador did two years ago. Technological triumph: Without abandoning its anti-inflationary ideals and fundamental philosophy of effective value storage, Bitcoin's technology evolves to enable faster, cheaper transactions. Its blockchain becomes as dependable and efficient as any payment processor. This giant step forward would make Bitcoin-powered cash register checkouts work better, too.\n\nWithout abandoning its anti-inflationary ideals and fundamental philosophy of effective value storage, Bitcoin's technology evolves to enable faster, cheaper transactions.

Investors of all shapes and sizes adopt this platform to protect and grow their long-lasting wealth.\n\nWall Street's titans, from to , start treating Bitcoin like a regular asset class, adding credibility and boosting demand. Investors of all shapes and sizes adopt this platform to protect and grow their long-lasting wealth. DeFi expansion: Given the successes listed above, Bitcoin would clearly become the bedrock of a flourishing DeFi ecosystem.\n\nNow, this hypothetical scenario paints a rosy picture indeed, but remember, it's the best case. We'll need a sprinkle of luck and a whole lot of development to get there. But hey, who doesn't love a good daydream?\n\nA total Bitcoin bust: The worst-case scenario\n\nOn the bearish side of the Bitcoin argument, many investors argue that this digital currency -- and all digital currencies -- are fundamentally worthless. For example, master investor and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.69%) (BRK.B 0.78%) CEO Warren Buffett has called Bitcoin \"rat poison squared.\"\n\nBuffett and like-minded critics see zero value in cryptocurrencies, so they expect the Bitcoin token to lose all of its value over time. This could happen in many different ways:\n\nGlobal ban: Governments worldwide unite against Bitcoin, effectively reducing its value to $0.00. The digital coin isn't worth anything if nobody can use, trade, or own it.\n\nGovernments worldwide unite against Bitcoin, effectively reducing its value to $0.00. The digital coin isn't worth anything if nobody can use, trade, or own it. Unplanned obsolescence: A new digital currency could emerge with superior technology, rendering Bitcoin obsolete overnight. The superior solution could bring tighter security, faster transactions, stronger privacy protections, or even lower energy consumption -- or maybe all of the above. Ouch!\n\nA new digital currency could emerge with superior technology, rendering Bitcoin obsolete overnight. The superior solution could bring tighter security, faster transactions, stronger privacy protections, or even lower energy consumption -- or maybe all of the above. Ouch! Catastrophic technical flaw: A major flaw could be discovered in Bitcoin's underlying technology, undermining the entire network's security. For example, the transaction system may turn out to be vulnerable to attacks by quantum computers. Whether anyone actually exploits the newfound security hole, the mere existence of it would make investors, consumers, governments, and businesses lose trust in Bitcoin. A sharp price drop won't be far behind.\n\nA major flaw could be discovered in Bitcoin's underlying technology, undermining the entire network's security.

Whether anyone actually exploits the newfound security hole, the mere existence of it would make investors, consumers, governments, and businesses lose trust in Bitcoin. A sharp price drop won't be far behind. Environmental impact: If Bitcoin's energy consumption continues to rise, it could draw more criticism and potential regulatory restrictions due to environmental concerns. If the complaints grow loud enough, Bitcoin could lose plenty of market trust and value this way.\n\nRemember, this scenario is as relentlessly pessimistic as the best-of-all-worlds discussion was shamelessly optimistic. The chances of these doom-and-gloom factors materializing are just as slim as all the pieces falling into place perfectly for a Bitcoin utopia. You should always pay attention to the potential risks of any investment, especially one as volatile and unpredictable as Bitcoin.\n\nBut the sky isn't falling on Bitcoin yet. So, with the most extreme possibilities out of the way, let's explore the more likely middle-ground for Bitcoin's future.\n\nThe middle road: The most realistic way forward\n\nThe extremely Utopian and dystopian reviews above are interesting thought experiments, not firm forecasts. In reality, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will surely see both good and bad news over the next few years. Digital currencies seem ready to reshape the financial markets on a global scale, but the road ahead looks rocky and packed with unexpected twists.\n\nSo here's what I see as a more realistic outlook for Bitcoin:\n\nRegulatory uncertainty: Governments worldwide are likely to continue grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Some will embrace Bitcoin and similar technologies, while others continue to impose restrictions. This tug-of-war may lead to periods of extreme volatility as the market reacts to regulatory news.\n\nGovernments worldwide are likely to continue grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Some will embrace Bitcoin and similar technologies, while others continue to impose restrictions. This tug-of-war may lead to periods of extreme volatility as the market reacts to regulatory news. Gradual adoption: More businesses and consumers will probably start using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but the pace of adoption will likely be gradual. Some companies might resist due to volatility risks, transaction costs, and regulatory concerns. Nevertheless, the trend toward greater acceptance seems inexorable.\n\nMore businesses and consumers will probably start using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but the pace of adoption will likely be gradual.

Competition from other cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin will likely face stiff competition from other cryptocurrencies. Some will offer faster transaction speeds, others come with lower fees, and a few should focus on enhanced privacy. While Bitcoin is by far the biggest fish in the crypto pond so far, it's far from the only one, and its long-term dominance is not guaranteed.\n\nBitcoin will likely face stiff competition from other cryptocurrencies. Some will offer faster transaction speeds, others come with lower fees, and a few should focus on enhanced privacy. While Bitcoin is by far the biggest fish in the crypto pond so far, it's far from the only one, and its long-term dominance is not guaranteed. Technical improvements: The Bitcoin network is likely to see further improvements, but these may be gradual and not without controversy. Remember, changes to the Bitcoin protocol require consensus among miners and node operators, which can be hard to achieve. For example, will Bitcoin ever move from Proof-of-Work validation to the less power-hungry Proof-of-Stake system, like Ethereum (ETH -1.97%) did in recent months? And if so, could Bitcoin still hold on to its lifetime cap of 21 million possible coins? And if not, rival coins might eventually use that foot in the door to topple Bitcoin from the crypto throne.\n\nThe Bitcoin network is likely to see further improvements, but these may be gradual and not without controversy. Remember, changes to the Bitcoin protocol require consensus among miners and node operators, which can be hard to achieve. Continued volatility: Bitcoin's price is likely to remain volatile, with significant price swings being the norm rather than the exception. This volatility might decrease as the market matures, but expect roller-coaster rides in the meantime.\n\nIn conclusion, while Bitcoin's future is uncertain, it's likely to be somewhere between the extremes of becoming the world's dominant form of money or disappearing entirely.\n\nMany years down the road, cryptocurrencies should become as uncontroversial as stocks, bonds, or savings accounts, with solid and consistent legal and regulatory rulebooks in every country. But that future is a long way away from 2023 and nobody knows exactly what those fully settled directives will look like, or what Bitcoin's specific role will be.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin and the broader crypto market is a journey, not a destination. Stay informed, keep learning, and make sure to adapt your investment strategy as this exciting new field continues to develop.\n\nFor now, Bitcoin and its crypto kin are still high-risk, high-reward investment assets. They may play a part in a diversified portfolio, but only for investors who can stomach their roller-coaster-like ups and downs. I'm cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin's future as a long-term winner. Just tread lightly in the cryptocurrency field, keep an eye out for bear traps, and manage most of your nest egg in more traditional forms such as stocks, cash, or index funds."

        "title": "Grimes and Bitcoin: How crypto and the open-source movement offer lessons for the music industry in the age of A.I. - Fortune",
        "content": "An A.I.-generated song featuring a \u201ccollaboration\u201d between Drake and The Weeknd turned up on streaming services and TikTok last month, quickly racking up millions of listens. In response, Universal Music Group, which represents the musicians, issued an agitated statement, and then, as the song turned up on other platforms, embarked on a legal whack-a-mole campaign in a bid to put the A.I. cat back in a bag.\n\nAll of this came even as the legal status of the song remains unclear. Some music business veterans argue the song was functionally no different than a remix, while others decried it as a dangerous new paradigm. Rarely does a video made by a random handle create such uproar.\n\nThen there\u2019s Grimes, who may not be as famous as fellow Canadian Drake, but is a critically acclaimed musician in her own right. Grimes, who is not affiliated with any record label, announced she will use that relative freedom to perform a radical experiment called \u201cElf.Tech.\u201d Using A.I., Elf.Tech allows users to generate a Grimes-style work with their own inputs. In return, all Grimes asks is for tasteful use of their now-open-source talent and a 50% cut on any master recording royalties.\n\nBecause the cost of producing high-quality music has dropped precipitously with advancements in A.I., the race to design a new distribution model is afoot. Currently, platforms must obtain permissions from both publishers and labels to play a song\u2014in most instances, the label owns the sound recording while the publisher controls the underlying music and lyrics. In Grimes\u2019s case, she could be the performer and also own the sound recording.\n\nTellingly, the first prompt on Elf.Tech asks users to connect to an email account or a cryptocurrency wallet. Presumably, the platform anticipates using blockchain and crypto to help enforce the suggested royalty split.\n\nUnfortunately, as veterans of the NFT space know, while smart contracts have the potential to create a more efficient royalties system, the reality is that the process remains messy since NFT marketplaces circumvent the rules. Nonetheless, many maintain hope a cultural or technical innovation\u2014likely tied to crypto\u2014will emerge to help artists enjoy a fairer compensation system.\n\nThough technology doesn\u2019t exist to enforce it yet, my long-term bet is that Grimes\u2019s approach will prevail over Universal\u2019s. The reason is that the challenges of generative A.I. have striking parallels to those of another disruptive technology: open-source software.\n\nAll software began as \u201copen source.\u201d Software vendors would provide their clients with their source code, the human-readable version of the software that\u2019s then transformed into machine code before it\u2019s executed. Tinkerers and computer scientists would modify software, learn from it, and share ideas. As the field commercialized, source code became closely protected, like a trade secret. While companies made handsome profits exerting copyright over their code, allowing for additional investments, the downside was a less cooperative environment.\n\nThe open-source movement, a reaction to ever-tighter controls over software, promoted the release of source code under permissive licenses to foster the tinkering, sharing of ideas, and collaboration seen in the field\u2019s early days. Today, open-source projects range from small hobbyist efforts to large-scale projects such as the Linux kernel, which is deployed in billions of devices around the world.\n\nIn similar fashion, traditional music publishers and labels thrived in a world where counterparties and IP were tightly controlled. Their moat was legal agreements that could hamstring pirates and, in some unfortunate cases, the artists themselves. As experimentation from pseudonymous creators\u2014including those who deploy A.I.\u2014shifts the balance of power from this model, artists will have to find new ways to engage with the increasing commoditization of their work.\n\nBitcoin, the first successful cryptocurrency, succeeded in large part because it was open-sourced. Alternatives to centralized institutions that issue credit require a radically transparent, queryable code base to stand apart. Early enthusiasts trusted the outcome of the Bitcoin ledger because they trusted the process, and because they could check it themselves. Today\u2019s music pioneers would be smart to take note.\n\nThe next few years will see more explicit separation of designing versus controlling music production. To that end, Grimes\u2019s experiment is a worthy exercise pushing the limits of a multibillion-dollar business and our burgeoning world of open-sourced talent.\n\nKathleen Breitman is a cofounder of Tezos.

        "content": "Bitcoin hit a wild high of $69,000 in November 2021. And despite a healthy rally in this year\u2019s first quarter, it\u2019s still down nearly two-thirds from its price record.\n\nThe good news? This price drop made it easier for folks to jump on the bitcoin bandwagon or continue stacking sats.\n\nOne million addresses now hold more than 1 BTC ($26,800), according to data from Glassnode.\n\nMost recently, the number of addresses with full BTC status picked up considerably at the end of February last year, when bitcoin was halfway through correcting after its record high.\n\nThere\u2019s some inverse correlation with bitcoin price and the number of \u2018full bitcoiner\u2019 addreses\n\nDan Ashmore, head of research at Investoo Group, told Blockworks that holding a full bitcoin is equal to roughly half the median US salary. So, while it\u2019s now easier than it was back in late 2021, it could eventually be out of reach for many once again if high prices return.\n\n\u201cThis is what we saw during the relentless bull market during the pandemic \u2014 a clear leveling off of the previous trajectory at which the number of addresses containing 1 bitcoin or more was growing,\u201d Ashmore told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cAs bitcoin fell in price last year, the previous upward trajectory in the growth of these addresses was resumed. I would not expect this pattern to change going forward.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that one bitcoin address doesn\u2019t always represent one person, so this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean one million people own 1 BTC. Certain individuals control multiple bitcoin addresses, while some addresses may belong to institutions or groups of people.\n\nAccording to Ashmore, the 1 million milestone highlights how deeply Bitcoin has established itself in the mainstream realm in recent years.\n\nWhales (and exchanges) among million full Bitcoin addresses\n\nDespite the Bitcoin network\u2019s inherent decentralization, the distribution of wealth is more concentrated than commonly assumed.\n\nOnly 7% of the supply (1.356 million BTC, worth $36.4 billion) is distributed among the nearly 46.5 million addresses with at least some bitcoin \u2014 but less than one \u2014 per BitInfoCharts.\n\nThe other 93% (18 million BTC, worth $482.7 billion) exists in the one million addresses that now own a full BTC.\n\nSo, the addresses containing more than 1 BTC represent about 2.1% of all non-zero Bitcoin addresses.\n\nIt must be stressed that those stats are somewhat skewed considering how much BTC resides within crypto exchange addresses \u2014 which mostly represent aggregate user holdings.\n\nCoinGlass shows 1.89 million BTC ($50.7 billion) sitting with crypto exchanges, about one in every 10 bitcoin in circulation, led by Binance, Coinbase and Bitfinex.\n\nThere\u2019s also the 1.46 million BTC ($39.2 billion) that Glassnode considers \u201cprobably lost\u201d forever, equal to 7.5% of all bitcoin in existence right now.\n\nStill, Erik Saberski, vice president of data science at The Tie, pointed out that even distribution across financial systems leads to stability in associated asset classes.\n\nFewer holders, on the other hand, results in imbalanced buying and selling pressure, causing significant price fluctuations. So, more people holding a full bitcoin could indicate increased price stability, reflecting bitcoin\u2019s maturation.\n\n\u201cBecause bitcoin is the flagship asset of the crypto economy, this signal of adoption seems to portend broader growth for the overall digital asset ecosystem,\u201d Saberski told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cWith this in mind, a measure for adoption does not necessarily suggest anything about the market in the short term. Indeed, adoption happens on a much slower timescale.\u201d\n\nDavid Canellis contributed reporting.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

It posted a weekly loss of 5.18%.\n\nOver the weekend, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency recorded a 2-month low, falling to US$25,964 on Saturday. The token has been experiencing network congestion with the popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals and new BRC-20 memecoins Pepe and Floki, driving up transaction costs.\n\nEther edged up 0.69% to US$1,809, maintaining the key US$1,800 support level, but down 3.54% over the past seven days.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain experienced technical issues twice on May 11 and 12 that caused the network to halt finalizing blocks, concerning users of the blockchain\u2019s performance stability.\n\nOn Saturday, Ethereum blockchain consultant Superphiz said on Twitter that the issue \u2014 which \u201cappears to have been caused by a high load on some Consensus Layers clients, which in turn was caused by an exceptional scenario\u201c \u2014 had been resolved.\n\nEthereum developers deployed updates in response to the tech problem, Superphiz confirmed.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher on Monday morning.

The Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency faced a surge in interest due to the higher transaction fees affecting the world\u2019s most dominant digital currency.\n\nLitecoin is also having its quadrennial block halving event on Aug. 3. Halving refers to a pre-programmed reduction of the rate at which new tokens are created, which reduces supply and can drive prices higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 0.43% in the past 24 hours to US$1.13 trillion. The total trading volume dropped 3.02% to US$22.07 billion.\n\nNFT index rises, Bitcoin Ordinals post highest sales\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index added 0.97% to 3,342.85 points in the 24 hours to 12:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, but is down 5.10% for the week.\n\nNFT sales on the Ethereum blockchain fell 15.52% in the past 24 hours to US$12.74 million, according to Cryptoslam data. However, NFT buyers on the Ethereum blockchain totaled 53,417 in the past seven days \u2014 a 188.55% increase from the previous week.\n\nWith the continuing rise in popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals \u2014 a type of NFT that are inscribed on individual satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin \u2014 Bitcoin placed second on Cryptoslam\u2019s blockchain ranking by NFT sales volume. That was an 80% rise taking the total to US$2.11 million.\n\n\u201cNFTs on the OG blockchain were red hot,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, an NFT strategist at Forkast Labs. As a result, he added, \u201cthe Bitcoin ecosystem seems to be in \u2018up only\u2019 mode right now, and when that will end, nobody knows.\u201d\n\nOrdinals also had the highest sales in the past seven days among NFT collections, jumping 459.16% to US$15.5 million. Binance NFT marketplace announced on May 9 that it plans to support the Bitcoin-based NFTs later this month.\n\nU.S. equity futures dip on default fears\n\nU.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen | Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged down 0.039%. The S&P 500 futures fell 0.042%, while the Nasdaq Composite futures lost 0.078%. The three U.S. indexes fell in regular trading on Friday as concerns remain about liquidity at regional banks and delays in talks to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said earlier in May that the Treasury will start to fail to meet U.S. payment obligations as early as June 1. Faster action is needed by Congress to avoid that scenario, she said.. But with an agreement yet to be reached, concern that the crisis could lead to a debt default is affecting general investor sentiment.\n\nDuring last week\u2019s Group of Seven finance ministers meeting in Japan, Yellen said that a U.S. default would spark an \u201ceconomic and financial catastrophe\u201d that will trigger a \u201cglobal economic downturn.\u201d\n\nYellen plans to update Congress on just how close the country is to defaulting on its financial obligations in the next two weeks, Bloomberg reported Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden and congressional leaders are scheduled to gather this week to discuss the forthcoming \u201cX date,\u201d or when the government may go into default.\n\nOn June 14, the Federal Reserve will decide its next move on interest rates. The rate of between 5 and 5.25% is the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 84.5% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June. However, it also predicts a 15.5% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, up from 3.9% on Friday."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied nearly 60% to around $27,000 in 2023 amid anticipations that the Federal Reserve would pause its quantitative tightening amid the U.S. banking crisis. Still, BTC price has failed to move beyond $30,000 decisively.\n\nBuying exhaustion at this key psychological level led to a price correction toward $25,000 over the past week. Interestingly, the decline has strengthened Bitcoin's correlation with several traditional financial metrics.\n\nBut does this raise the risk of Bitcoin continuing its downtrend in Q2? Let's have a closer look.\n\nU.S. dollar index's double bottom\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback\u2019s strength against a basket of top foreign currencies, rose 1.4% to 102.70 in the week ending May 14. The rise marked the dollar\u2019s best week since September 2022.\n\nInterestingly, the dollar\u2019s rise left behind a potential double-bottom pattern, confirmed by two low points near a similar horizontal price level of around 100.75. A double-bottom pattern is a bullish reversal setup, suggesting DXY could rise toward 105.85 in the next few months.\n\nDXY weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nDXY's weekly relative strength index (RSI), which has undergone a rebound after reaching 35 \u2014 just five points above the oversold threshold \u2014 further hints at bullish continuation, which is typically a bad omen for Bitcoin's price.\n\nThe main reason is the strengthening negative weekly correlation between Bitcoin and DXY, with the coefficient around -50 as of May 14.\n\nEarlier in the week, the latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed headline inflation dropped to 4.9% in April versus the previous month\u2019s 5%. However, core inflation was up 5.5%, suggesting underlying price pressures remain sticky, which for now has cooled down Fed rate cut expectations.\n\nJohn Authers from Bloomberg writes:\n\n\u201cThe odds of a \u2018pause\u2019 in interest rate hikes next month have now risen to virtual certainty in futures and swaps markets, having been seen as an 84% chance before the numbers came out.\u201d\n\nA Fed pause should result in a stabilizing bond market. History indicates that stable interest rates have been good for U.S. Treasurys but bad for stocks, with Erin Browne and Emmanuel Sharef of Pimco saying:\n\n\u201cIf the Fed pauses at its peak rate for at least six months and the U.S. slides into recession, then history suggests 12-month returns following the final rate hike could be flat for 10-year U.S. Treasurys, while the S&P 500 could sell off sharply.\u201d\n\nThus, a souring risk appetite would be a boon for the dollar, while increasing the risk of Bitcoin failing to reclaim $30,000 in the short term.\n\nGold price near key reversal point\n\nThe price of gold has risen nearly 15% to over $2,000 an ounce amid the banking crisis. The positive correlation with Bitcoin has also grown stronger with its weekly coefficient reading at 0.82 as of May 14.\n\nBut gold\u2019s rally has brought its price to an infamous horizontal resistance level near $2,075. In March 2022, this level was instrumental in triggering a sharp bearish reversal phase that led gold to drop by up to 22%.\n\nXAU/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSimilarly, testing the level as resistance in August 2020 preceded an 18% price decline. Should the scenario repeat in 2023, gold\u2019s price could fall toward its 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) near $1,850.\n\nGold\u2019s weekly RSI, treading around its overbought reading of 70, indicates a similar downside scenario. As a result of the precious metal\u2019s positive correlation with Bitcoin, the latter may see a similar correction in Q2.\n\nM2 money supply declines\n\nM2 measures cash in circulation plus dollars in bank and money-market accounts. The M2 figure surged by more than 40% during the Covid-19 pandemic due to the Fed's quantitative easing, hitting a peak of $21.84 trillion in January 2022.\n\nIt has since declined to $20.81 trillion, down over 4% from peak, in May 2023.\n\nU.S. M2 monthly supply chart. Source: TradingView\n\nA 2%-plus drop in the M2 supply \u2014 something which has happened four times to date \u2014 is bad news for the stock market since it preceded three depressions and one panic.\n\nIn other words, the significant move lower in M2 could foreshadow new lows for Bitcoin, which often moves in tandem with U.S. stock indexes.\n\nCurrently, the weekly correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq-100 index is 0.92.\n\nBitcoin price \u201crising wedge\u201d\n\nBitcoin appears to be heading toward the $15,000-$20,000 price range, depending on its potential breakdown point from what appears to be a rising wedge pattern.\n\nBTC/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nFor technical analysts, a rising wedge is a bearish reversal pattern that appears when the price rises higher inside a range defined by two contracting, ascending trendlines. It resolves after price breaks below the lower trendline, falling by as much as the maximum wedge height.\n\nRelated: BTC price bounces at $25.8K lows amid warning over low whale interest\n\nIf this BTC price pattern is confirmed, particularly given the above-mentioned macro indicators, Bitcoin price stands to decline to as low as $15,000 in 2023, down about 45% from current price levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "The correlation between bitcoin and ether prices fell below 80% for the first time since November 2021, indicating a significant shift in the relationship between the two largest cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe rolling 30-day correlation between bitcoin and ether dipped to about 78% this week, according to data provider Kaiko. Correlation measures how closely the prices of two assets move together. When the correlation is low, it means their prices are moving in different directions more often.\n\nIn other words, the falling correlation means that BTC and ETH prices are not moving together as closely as they used to.\n\nBitcoin-ether correlation falling\n\nLast month, Coinbase analyzed the correlation between BTC and ETH returns. The exchange concluded that it has been falling since mid-to-late March as bitcoin began to outperform other cryptocurrencies against the backdrop of U.S. banking sector turmoil and heightened regulatory scrutiny on non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\n\"But the decline of that relationship has become more pronounced in the days following the Shanghai (Shapella) fork, reminiscent of a similar trend observed in September 2022 during the Merge (when Ethereum changed its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake),\" Coinbase said at the time.\n\nTheoretically, a falling correlation between two assets reinforces the case for diversification by including both assets in an investment portfolio.\n\nBitcoin and ether prices are up around 62% and 50% so far in 2023, respectively, according to The Block's Data Dashboard.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "This is an opinion editorial by Robert Hall, a content creator and small business owner.\n\nThe race for the 2024 U.S. presidential election is starting to kick into gear, featuring some of the same cast of characters from the last few elections. On the Democratic side, you have Joe Biden, Robert F. Kennedy and Marianne Williamson suggesting they will run. Then, Former President Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy are on the other side of the aisle.\n\nIf you have been following the race so far, you might know that Trump seems to be walking away with the nomination before the process even starts next year. If he ends up being the nominee, we will likely get a re-run of 2020, where we have two men over 70 years old who both think that they know what is right for the country. Who else is tired of having baby boomers running the show? I am, to be honest.\n\nBoomer Presidents Don\u2019t Understand Bitcoin\n\nBaby boomers, you\u2019ve had their time in the sun. It\u2019s time to leave the stage and let the younger generations of leaders have a chance to lead the country. We need leaders who understand the emerging challenges facing America as we speak.\n\nWe need leaders who thoroughly understand economic policy and the value of innovation in the financial space. For instance, the baby boomers at the top of the ticket don\u2019t have the depth or the capacity to understand the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that Bitcoin presents to America and the American people.\n\nBiden and Trump have been openly hostile towards Bitcoin because they believe in the supremacy of the fiat dollar system. The time is now to elect someone with a bold vision for the future, who understands that the way that the entitlement systems are set up and the dollar's role in the world isn\u2019t sustainable over the long term.\n\nIf America stays on its current path, it will only lead to chaos, lawlessness, and a lower standard of living for everyone. Is this the future that you want for your children and grandchildren? 2024 is our chance to start a new journey toward freedom, the rule of law and the opportunity to make something of yourself, regardless of your station in life.\n\nWhy We Need A Bitcoiner As President\n\nIt has been reported recently that the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, is close to a decision on whether to run for president next year. For those who don\u2019t know him, he is one of the most pro-Bitcoin politicians in the country. He has actively courted Bitcoiners to come to Miami and help make it the Bitcoin capital of the world. So far, he has largely succeeded in doing that.\n\nBut in addition to making the U.S. an epicenter for Bitcoin innovation, having a Bitcoiner like Suarez as president will, critically, stop the emergence of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in America dead in its tracks. If Biden or Trump is elected, it is almost certain that some form of CBDC will be activated in America. With the deployment of a CBDC, you can kiss your financial freedom goodbye. You can kiss your privacy goodbye.\n\nYou will no longer have autonomy over what you can eat or how far you can travel. You will have a social credit score, as has been implemented in China. Is this the type of life that you want? We have to strive for a better life.\n\nJust recently, the rails for a CBDC were introduced to the public. FedNow, as it is called, will be operational by July 2023. It is said that it will be used to speed up payments between customers and businesses, which may be accurate at the moment. However, as with any system, it will likely evolve into something vastly different than what it was intended to be.\n\nCan we really trust a government that has given us the Patriot Act, PRISM and now the proposed RESTRICT Act to resist total control over what you spend your money on?\n\nThe RESTRICT Act, for instance, put forth by none other than Bitcoin-hating Senator Elizabeth Warren, has the potential to harm Bitcoiners in the United States with its overly-broad language about digital communication tools being a threat to national security. While the overt target may be TikTok, nothing is stopping regulators from using this law against Bitcoin in the future.\n\nLooking past this smokescreen, you can see that they are building their case to the public: Hilary Clinton, international regulators and the U.S. Treasury have all warned about the dangers of cryptocurrency.\n\nNow, put this in the context of $31 trillion in U.S. national debt, unsustainable entitlement spending, a world slowly moving away from the dollar, high gas prices and uncontrollable inflation. Then it becomes clear that they will close off the exits to Bitcoin before most people learn about how to use them. They want to herd the masses into a CBDC for a \u201cgreat reset\u201d of the monetary system. This is coming if we don\u2019t start electing people who understand that Bitcoin is our last chance to escape a sinking ship.\n\nMayor Saurez gets it, and if any other politicians in America understand Bitcoin, it is time that we support them and get more Bitcoiners in office. The dollar is the Titanic, and Bitcoin is the lifeboat. Will enough people get on to be saved? Time will tell and the upcoming presidential election could be a final chance.\n\nThis is a guest post by Robert Hall.

        "title": "CEA Deserves an F on Bitcoin Mining Tax Analysis - AIER - Daily Economy News",
        "content": "On May 2, President Biden\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) released a statement describing a proposed Digital Asset Mining Excise (DAME) tax. The proposal would impose a tax on cryptomining equal to 30 percent of the electricity used in this activity. In outlining this proposal, the CEA displayed a great deal of ignorance about energy usage, bitcoin, and economic policy.\n\nFor starters, we should dispense with the term cryptomining. Bitcoin miners are the only people engaged in what the CEA deems cryptomining. The proposed rule is a tax on bitcoin mining.\n\nWhat is bitcoin mining?\n\nThe bitcoin network allows people to send the digital asset known as bitcoin to one another without any trusted third-party serving as an intermediary. These transactions are recorded on a digital ledger known as a blockchain. When one person wants to send bitcoin to another person, the transaction is broadcast to the network. \u201cMiners\u201d then compete to add blocks of these transactions to the ledger.\n\nThe mining process entails passing information about the block of transactions through a cryptographic hashing algorithm to generate an output of fixed-length. The first miner to find an output below a particular threshold value broadcasts its solution to the rest of the network. Other miners verify the solution, add the block of transactions to the blockchain, and start work on the next block of transactions. Although it is difficult to find an output below a particular threshold, it is easy to verify. This allows for decentralized maintenance of the ledger. Rather than relying on one individual or entity to maintain the ledger, the ledger is updated through the consensus of those on the network.\n\nProducing an appropriate hash and, hence, adding a block to the blockchain is random. Miners are essentially guessing solutions until one is found. They use specialized machines designed to guess solutions quickly. Since it is random, it is impossible to know ahead of time which miner will find the next block. The faster a machine can guess, the better the odds of success. But greater computational power is no guarantee of success.\n\nMiners have an incentive to maintain the ledger. Successfully mining a block of transactions comes with a block reward of newly issued bitcoin, and any transaction fees offered by users. The block reward is currently 6.25 bitcoin, which is worth roughly $175,000. (Eventually, around the year 2140, the block reward will cease and miners will only receive transaction fees. At that point, the supply of bitcoin will be fixed.)\n\nBitcoin mining is computationally intensive. But this computational intensity has a purpose. By making the mining process random, the settlement of bitcoin transactions is resistant to censorship. Since the next successful miner cannot be known ahead of time, there is no single party that gets to determine whether a transaction is valid, no individual or entity that can be threatened or punished to prevent adding a transaction to the ledger, and no single point of failure.\n\nBitcoin mining makes it possible to engage in electronic peer-to-peer transactions similar to the physical exchange of cash; to trade without the permission of some trusted third party. It is particularly valuable for people living under authoritarian regimes or under governments that impose strict capital controls.\n\nWhy does the CEA want to tax bitcoin mining?\n\nGiven the computational intensity involved in bitcoin mining, a number of people have expressed concerns about its environmental impact. According to the CEA, the DAME tax is motivated by the fact that bitcoin miners \u201cdo not have to pay for the full cost they impose on others, in the form of local environmental pollution, higher energy prices, and the impacts of increased greenhouse gas emissions on the climate.\u201d They argue that imposing the tax will force bitcoin miners to internalize these costs.\n\nIn other words, the CEA is making an externality argument. While bitcoin mining benefits miners, the CEA says it imposes an additional cost \u2014 a negative externality \u2014 on third parties that miners do not take into account when deciding how much to mine. If so, miners will tend to mine too much and a tax on mining might be used to discourage them from doing so.\n\nThe CEA claims the externality comes in the form of an environmental cost. Bitcoin miners require electricity to operate, and the generation of electricity creates environmental costs.\n\nProblems with the CEA\u2019s argument\n\nThe CEA\u2019s argument fails on a number of counts. Consider first the externality. The careful reader will note that the source of the environmental cost is electricity generation, not bitcoin mining. If generating electricity imposes costs on third parties, then the externality argument implies that a tax should be placed on electricity generation. Taxing a particular type of electricity-using activity does not provide an incentive to reduce electricity. It provides an incentive to switch from the taxed electricity-using activity to other, untaxed, electricity-using activities.\n\nThe CEA implicitly assumes that a reduction in electricity used by bitcoin mining is a reduction in electricity generated. Even ignoring the prospect of switching from taxed to untaxed electricity-using activities, that\u2019s not true. A lot of electricity production is wasted: the electricity is produced, but isn\u2019t used. To the extent that bitcoin miners use electricity that would otherwise be wasted, reducing bitcoin mining will not reduce electricity generation. That\u2019s unfortunate, since there is no social cost of mining bitcoin with wasted energy.\n\nIn some cases, there is even a social benefit to mining bitcoin with wasted energy. For example, stranded natural gas is typically burned, emitting methane in the process. Currently, people are purchasing this stranded natural gas and using it to generate electricity to power bitcoin miners. In doing so, they are limiting harmful methane emissions associated with flaring natural gas. In these cases, bitcoin mining generates a positive externality. Applying the CEA\u2019s logic, this type of activity should be subsidized \u2014 not taxed.\n\nIn places like Texas, bitcoin mining is used as a way to balance the electrical grid. Bitcoin miners run when electricity usage (and therefore the price of electricity) is low. When electricity costs are high, the miners turn off and allow for other uses. The result is a more stable and predictable supply of electricity for ordinary users \u2014 another positive externality.\n\nThe ability of bitcoin mining to stabilize electricity supply can also be used to make green energy more effective, which the CEA fails to appreciate. Windmills and solar panels are capable of generating electricity, but they are intermittent sources: if the wind isn\u2019t blowing or the sun isn\u2019t shining, no electricity is generated. Furthermore, if the timing of electricity use does not line up with the times when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining, then some of the energy produced using green methods is wasted. This can make it hard to justify using these technologies to generate electricity at scale. By serving as a buyer of last resort, bitcoin mining can create the conditions under which these technologies can be used at scale to produce electricity \u2014 still another positive externality.\n\nMore generally, the CEA ignores the fact that all electricity is not generated from the same source. Windmills, natural gas, coal, and the natural flow of moving water can all be used to generate electricity. Each of these sources, however, produces a different degree of environmental costs in the production of electricity. By taxing a particular use case of electricity, the tax treats the environmental costs as identical across different methods of generating electricity.\n\nThis point is especially important when considering the global effects of the DAME tax. The DAME tax would make mining prohibitively expensive in the United States. By discouraging bitcoin mining in the US, the DAME tax would make bitcoin mining more profitable elsewhere. As a result, bitcoin mining would relocate, likely to places where electricity generation has significantly higher environmental costs than in the US. In other words, the DAME tax would likely increase global emissions on net.\n\nOverall, the CEA\u2019s discussion of the DAME tax proposal is disappointing. The CEA seems to be ignorant of bitcoin and the process by which energy is produced and consumed. And its economic analysis is flawed. Externalities associated with electricity generation are not unique to bitcoin mining and, hence, do not justify a tax on bitcoin mining. If such a tax is warranted, it is warranted on electricity generation \u2014 and only to the extent that the particular type of electricity generation is characterized by a negative externality. The CEA\u2019s argument would result in a failure on an introductory microeconomics exam. One expects better from a team of professional economists."

Two hours after the email was sent, the hashtag \u201c#deletecoinbase\u201d hit the trending sidebar on Twitter, with over 14,000 comments calling on users to boycott the exchange. Paul Grewal, the Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, took to Twitter to respond to the outrage and apologized: \u201cWe screwed up and we are sorry.\u201d\n\nFlorida governor signs CBDC bill into law, restricting some uses of US and foreign CBDCs\n\nUnited State\u2019s Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill restricting the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the state. The new law prohibits the use of a United States federal CBDC \u201cas money within Florida\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).\u201d It also bans the use of CBDCs issued by foreign governments and calls on other states to use their commercial codes to institute similar prohibitions. DeSantis said he was spurred into action by White House studies of the new financial technology. The law takes effect on July 1.\n\nMilady memecoin surges 5,250% after Musk tweet, exchange listings\n\nMilady (LADYS), the self-organized memecoin based on the anime avatar NFT collection of the same name, surged by over 5,250% on May 11 after Elon Musk tweeted a meme using the imagery of a Milady NFT. The tweet also boosted the collection\u2019s average sale price. \u201cLADYS is a meme coin without any intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap,\u201d said the token developers. \u201cThe coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.\u201d\n\nOrdinals good or bad for Bitcoin? Supporters and opposers raise voices\n\nBitcoin Ordinals continue to inspire debate among the Bitcoin community. Soon after their introduction in January 2023, opponents of the technology began to raise concerns about its perceived flaws, citing slow speeds and rising transaction costs. Meanwhile, its supporters claim that the ordinals provide more opportunity, improve decentralization and ensure freedom of expression. The technology enables adding text, images and code on a satoshi \u2014 the smallest unit of Bitcoin.\n\nTo catch a scammer: Kraken builds fake crypto account to \u2018bait\u2019 fraudsters\n\nCrypto exchange Kraken has provided a novel method for flagging malicious wallets \u2014 building a fake crypto environment to \u201cscam bait\u201d bad actors. Kraken created the \u201ccustom environment\u201d for popular streamer Kitboga to frustrate a scammer posing as U.S. President Joe Biden. The punchline comes when Kitboga, who portrays an elderly person with a $450,000 balance in Bitcoin, infuriates the scammer after incorrectly typing his wallet address before sending over all of the funds.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $26,707, Ether (ETH) at $1,803 and XRP at $0.43.

Bitcoin average transaction fees were at $19.20 on May 8, according to BitInfoCharts, while the backlog of transactions stood at 459,341 on the same day. The increased demand on the network has even caused total fees per block to temporarily exceed the block subsidy reward of 6.25 BTC. Bitcoin analysts and commentators have rushed to allay community fears.\n\nParaSpace team clashes with CEO over alleged whereabouts of protocol funds\n\nNFT protocol ParaSpace published several alleged irregularities tying its CEO Yubo Ruan to mismanagement of funds equaling 2,909 Ether.

        "content": "The S&P 500 Index (SPX) closed the week with a nominal loss of 0.29% but Bitcoin (BTC) is on target to finish the week with a deeper cut of more than 5%. The weakness in Bitcoin pulled several altcoins lower, indicating weakening sentiment.\n\nA silver lining is Bitcoin\u2019s solid bounce on May 12. Several analysts anticipate Bitcoin to start a recovery but monitoring resource Material Indicators sounded cautious.\n\nIn a recent analysis, they said that the lack of a strong bid from the whales at lower levels could be a concerning sign. They believe that the bullish perspective will invalidate if Bitcoin sustains below the 200-week moving average.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nOver the next few days, the progress on the debt ceiling talks between leaders from Congress and the White House is expected to take center stage. The uncertainty and risks of a potential U.S. default could keep the rally in the equities markets under check but it is difficult to predict how Bitcoin and altcoins will react to all the chaos.\n\nBitcoin has started a corrective phase and most altcoins have broken below their respective support levels. Only a handful of cryptocurrencies are looking positive on the charts. Let\u2019s analyze the chart of the top five cryptocurrencies that may turn up in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nThe long tail on Bitcoin\u2019s May 12 candlestick shows that the bulls are aggressively buying the dips to the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBuyers will try to push the price back into the triangle but may face stiff resistance from the bears. The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($27,959) and the relative strength index below 41 indicate that bears have a slight edge.\n\nIf the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will again attempt to sink the BTC/USDT pair below $25,250. If they can pull it off, the selling may intensify and the pair could crash to $20,000.\n\nOn the upside, the bulls will have to clear the hurdle at the resistance line to regain control. The pair may then retest the overhead resistance at $31,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAfter facing stiff resistance at the 20-EMA, the bulls have cleared the obstacle. This indicates that the bulls are trying to seize control. The pair may first climb to the 50-simple moving average and then to $28,400.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down sharply from the current level, it will suggest that the bears are trying to flip the support line of the triangle into resistance. The pair may then plunge to the crucial support at $25,250.\n\nCardano price analysis\n\nCardano\u2019s (ADA) solid rebound off the uptrend line on May 11 suggests that lower levels continue to attract strong buying.\n\nADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls will try to resume the recovery by propelling the price to the 20-day EMA ($0.38). This level may act as a minor barrier but if bulls overcome it, the ADA/USDT pair could soar toward the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. This level is likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears.\n\nAnother possibility is that the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and drops to the uptrend line. The repeated retest of a support level at short intervals tends to weaken it. That may open the doors for a potential fall to $0.30.\n\nADA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls pushed the price above the moving averages, indicating that the bears may be losing their grip. The 20-EMA has started to turn up gradually and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating that the bulls are on a comeback.\n\nIf buyers pierce the overhead resistance at $0.37, the pair could pick up momentum and rally to $0.40 and later to $0.42. Conversely, if the price turns down from $0.37, the pair may slide to the uptrend line.\n\nCosmos price analysis\n\nCosmos (ATOM) snapped back from the $10.20 support on May 10, indicating that the bulls are buying the dips to this level.\n\nATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to halt the relief rally at the 50-day SMA ($11.28) but the bulls have not given up much ground. This enhances the prospects of a rally above the 50-day SMA. If that happens, the ATOM/USDT pair could rally to the downtrend line.\n\nThis is an important level for the sellers to guard because a break above it will invalidate the bearish descending triangle pattern.\n\nThe critical support to watch on the downside is $10.20. If it cracks, the descending triangle will complete and the pair may then plummet to $8.50.\n\nATOM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the relief rally is facing selling at higher levels, but the price action is forming a possible inverse head-and-shoulders pattern that will complete on a break and close above $11.30. The pair may then start an up-move to $12 and subsequently to $12.50.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will suggest that the bears are in control. The pair may then slump toward the vital support at $10.20. A bounce off this level could keep the pair inside the boundaries of $11.30 and $10.20 for a while longer.\n\nRelated: 4 alarming charts for Bitcoin bulls as $27K becomes formidable hurdle\n\nLido DAO price analysis\n\nLido Dao (LDO) rebounded off the $1.60 support and has reached the overhead resistance at the 20-day EMA ($1.95).\n\nLDO/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to protect the 20-day EMA but the bulls have not given up. This suggests that the buyers expect the recovery to continue. If bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the LDO/USDT pair could rally to the downtrend line. This level is likely to attract strong selling by the bears.\n\nIf buyers arrest the next decline above the 20-day EMA, that would suggest a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. The pair could then start a sustained recovery above the downtrend line.\n\nOn the downside, the bears will have to sink and sustain the price below $1.60 to indicate the resumption of the downtrend.\n\nLDO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls are trying to propel the price above the overhead resistance at $1.98. If they succeed, the pair will complete a bullish double-bottom pattern. This reversal setup has a target objective of $2.39. If this level is also crossed, the pair may reach $2.60.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down from the current level or $1.98 and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that bears are active at higher levels. That may keep the pair stuck between $1.57 and $1.98 for some time.\n\nArbitrum price analysis\n\nArbitrum (ARB) has been finding support near the psychologically important level of $1, indicating that the bulls are aggressively buying the dips.\n\nARB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nOn the upside, the bears have been attempting to stall the recovery at $1.20 but a minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have kept up the buying pressure. That increases the likelihood of a break above $1.20. If that happens, the ARB/USDT pair could rise to $1.40 and later to $1.50.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down sharply from $1.20. That will point to a possible consolidation between $1 and $1.20 for a few days.\n\nARB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA on the four-hour chart has started to turn up, and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. Buyers will try to strengthen their position by pushing the pair above $1.20. If they do that, the pair will complete a double-bottom pattern, which has a target objective of $1.35.\n\nThe first sign of strength for the bears will be a break and close below the 20-EMA. That could pull the pair to $1.05. A slide below $1 will signal the resumption of the downtrend.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "If you\u2019ve got a spare Raspberry Pi lying around, you really should put it to good use. If you don\u2019t have a functional project in mind, you could always gamble a bit like maker Data Slayer is doing with this Bitcoin mining project . With a Raspberry Pi Zero alongside a USB Antminer device, he\u2019s taking a chance (a very small chance) that he will luck out and win some serious cryptocurrency.\n\nThe way the project works is simple enough. The Raspberry Pi is running Raspberry Pi OS. It\u2019s connected to an Antminer via USB which is responsible for handling Bitcoin mining algorithms. The system is connected to it Bitcoin wallet which will receive a handsome deposit if he\u2019s lucky enough to win an entire hash. Because the system is so small, it\u2019s not practical enough for regular mining and is better suited for what\u2019s called lotto mining. In this case, he has a 1 in 2 billion chance of winning a whole block each day.\n\nData Slayer is using a Raspberry Pi Zero W which needs network connectivity to function. It\u2019s connected to the Antminer USB stick which requires a huge heatsink while operating to keep cool. For storage, the project is relying on a 32 GB micro SD card. The system is a headless setup so it must be operated over SSH.\n\nTo conserve resources, Data Slayer is using the 32-bit Lite version of Raspberry Pi OS. Once he had the operating system installed, he remoted into the Pi via SSH to install CG Miner. This application is main driver behind the mining operation. In the demo, Data Slayer is using the SHA-256 algorithm for mining which can be configured in CG Miner. The project video shares plenty of details on how to install the system, set up the miner, and connect it to your wallet.\n\nIs this project practical? Not really. Is it fun and worth tinkering around with on a lazy afternoon? Absolutely. If you want to recreate this Raspberry Pi project or just get a closer look at how it goes together, check out the original video shared to YouTube by Data Slayer and be sure to follow him for more cool projects as well as any future updates on this one."

        "content": "Can BRICS build something with Bitcoin?\n\nBRICS is a term you may have heard thrown around in the news or in conversations about the global economy. But what exactly is BRICS?\n\nIn short, BRICS is an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. These five countries, representing some of the world\u2019s largest economies, came together in 2009 (and South Africa in 2010), with Saudi Arabia looking to join.\n\nThe population of this group is estimated at 3.2 billion people.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of BRICS is their plans to back a new currency with commodities. China first proposed this idea, and since then, the group has been working towards making it a reality. The goal of the new currency is to reduce reliance on the US dollar.\n\nThe formation of this new currency aims to re-establish the connection between hard assets and currency. A currency backed by gold, oil and other commodities would re-forge a link between money and reality. As this relationship is absent in the dollar system today, reducing the weaponization of the dollar and the risk of economic instability is the main driver behind the initiative.\n\nTo back the new currency, BRICS countries have been working on increasing their gold reserves, which will serve as a potential backing for the currency. They have also been exploring the possibility of creating a BRICS development bank to fund infrastructure projects in member countries and reduce dependence on institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nBut how practical is backing a currency with physical commodities?\n\nWhile the idea of a new currency backed by gold or other physical commodities will solve the current issue of fiat currencies being backed by thin air, there are also valid concerns about the practicality of such a system in the digital age.\n\nAn alternative to a physical commodity-backed currency is a Bitcoin standard. One of the main issues with backing a currency with physical commodities is trust. There needs to be trust that the commodities are actually there and that they are of the stated quality and quantity. This can be difficult to ensure, particularly when dealing with multiple countries with different regulatory systems and levels of transparency.\n\nThere are concerns about the environmental impact of using physical commodities as a backing for a currency. These commodities are not digital and cannot be carbon neutral, which could pose a challenge for meeting the needs of the ESG initiative.\n\nAnother question is who will audit the commodities? This is a crucial issue that must be addressed to maintain the integrity of the new currency system.\n\nWill they send in an auditor to verify China\u2019s gold reserves and likewise, will China be sending in investigators to validate Russia\u2019s oil reserves? What we do know is this type of arrangement will require trust, and although these countries have a mutually beneficial relationship now, that may not last forever. They will need a commodity-backed currency that is not based on trust.\n\nWhile the idea of backing a new currency with physical commodities may have its appeal, it faces significant challenges that make it impractical in today\u2019s world. Compare this to a Bitcoin standard, that can offer a viable alternative that is transparent, secure, and decentralised.\n\nIs it possible these countries have already thought this far ahead? Will the USA witness an epic own goal? Will they rise to the challenge and launch a revolutionary digi-dollar backed by Bitcoin? Or will the BRICS nations step up and embrace Bitcoin into their financial systems? Or, in a stunning twist of fate, will Bitcoin itself emerge as the ultimate champion and reign supreme over them all? The suspense is palpable!"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has been struggling to break through the crucial $30,000 price level in recent weeks, despite gaining renewed support from factors such as the United States banking crisis.\n\nAs the maiden cryptocurrency experiences a lackluster performance, market analysts are closely monitoring its next price trajectory, especially regarding the next all-time high.\n\nIn particular, a recognized pseudonymous crypto analyst El_crypto_prof, who took to Twitter on May 13, suggested that Bitcoin\u2019s price action follows a pattern of higher highs and higher lows that often leads to a parabolic rally. This means that as the cryptocurrency\u2019s value increases, it tends to surge even faster, resulting in exponential growth.\n\nBased on this pattern, the analyst suggested that Bitcoin could achieve a new all-time high before 2025. This is because the cryptocurrency has been consistently exhibiting a series of higher lows over the past few months, which could indicate that it is on track to establish a new higher high.\n\n#Bitcoin (W)\n\n\n\nLooking at my timeline, there are only a handful of analysts who see what $BTC is doing here.\n\n\n\nIt works on the upside just like it works on the downside.\n\n\n\nA series of higher highs and higher lows eventually results in a parabolic rally.\n\n\n\nNew ATH before 2025 imo. pic.twitter.com/DrtgtEqwaT \u2014 \ud835\udd44\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd66\ud835\udd64\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd54\u24d7\ud835\udd56 \ud83e\uddf2 (@el_crypto_prof) May 13, 2023\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next all-time high\n\nBesides the historical chart pattern trends, Bitcoin is also banking on factors like the upcoming halving and possible regulatory clarity as a potential foundation for a new all-time high. The last record high was in late 2021 when the asset peaked at almost $69,000.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Bitcoin has been unable to maintain gains above the $30,000 level since mid-April. As of May 12, the cryptocurrency saw its lowest level of trade since mid-March, dropping below $27,000 due to ongoing volatility fueled by low liquidity in the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nThe renewed losses in Bitcoin can also be attributed to the increased regulatory scrutiny in the industry. Recently, Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), raising concerns about potential violations of federal securities laws through related-party transactions. This development has created uncertainty for the publicly traded mining company.\n\nAs Bitcoin looks to reclaim a new record high, the crypto community is projecting a possible price decline in the coming weeks. As per Finbold report, a crypto community with 82% historical accuracy predicted that Bitcoin would likely tumble and trade at $24,753 on May 31.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAs of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $26,801, reflecting a modest daily gain of around 1.6%. However, on the weekly, the cryptocurrency has declined by almost 7%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nA look at Bitcoin\u2019s technical analysis shows a bearish sentiment prevailing. According to a review of one-day gauges obtained from TradingView, the recommended sentiment is \u201dsell\u201d at 11. The moving averages indicate a \u201dsell\u201d sentiment at 9, while the oscillators are neutral at 8.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis.
