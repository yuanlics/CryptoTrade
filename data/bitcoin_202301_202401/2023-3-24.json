        "title": "Why keeping Bitcoin mining in the U.S. helps the economy and national security\u2014and even the environment - Fortune",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining exists primarily to build a global digital network for storing value without the need for a bank or other intermediary, and for peer-to-peer exchanges. It\u2019s also one of the most environmentally friendly industries in the world.\n\nThe Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance estimates that global Bitcoin mining uses less than 0.2% of the world\u2019s energy production\u2014roughly comparable to all refrigerators in the U.S. and far less than data centers and data networks generally.\n\nIn other words, it uses a very small amount of energy in the grand scheme of things\u2014and nearly 60% of what it does use comes from renewable sources, according to data published by the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Bitcoin mining also helps create a marketplace for intermittent sources such as solar and wind during their off-peak hours.\n\nFurthermore, unlike other data centers, mining facilities can shut down at a moment\u2019s notice during high-demand events such as extreme weather to provide grid stability and prevent the use of fossil-fuel powered peaker plants.\n\nYet the current administration, fringe politicians, and environmental groups are singling out Bitcoin mining by attempting to limit access to energy and imposing or proposing taxes so high the industry will have ever reason to leave the U.S. entirely. And that\u2019s assuming they don\u2019t try to ban it altogether.\n\nThese critics are now citing \u201cmarginal emissions\u201d data, which is merely cherry-picking businesses they don\u2019t like for political reasons, and saying that those businesses use too much energy. To be clear, Bitcoin mining does not emit anything\u2014it requires computers, which use electricity just like any other data center.\n\nTo say these policy proposals and their tortured justifications are misguided would be the kindest possible reading. Their effects would be devastating to the environment, the economy, and U.S. national security.\n\nRelative to other leading Bitcoin mining jurisdictions, the U.S. has an extremely clean energy grid. Texas is a leader in Bitcoin mining and the home of Riot Platforms\u2019 operations, the largest Bitcoin mine in North America. According to the American Clean Power Association, Texas led the nation in renewable energy capacity added in 2021\u2014close to three times that of second-place California.\n\nPushing Bitcoin mining offshore, under the guise of environmentalism, would only mean the U.S. will capture less of Bitcoin\u2019s value, and more mining will happen connected to dirtier energy grids in more hostile parts of the world. For example, Russia is infamous for not only fossil fuel production and its use of energy for political brinksmanship, it\u2019s among world leaders in leaking methane into the atmosphere. It\u2019s already among the top five Bitcoin mining jurisdictions and seeking more market share. Weakening the American Bitcoin mining industry would be an enormous gift to Russia\u2014and increase global carbon emissions.\n\nThat leads to the national security issue. As noted in a recent Justice Department report on cryptocurrencies, America has strong anti-money laundering rules and ensures that as people move Bitcoin value from the network in and out of traditional accounts, it is traceable\u2014nefarious actors can be caught, unlike in other parts of the world. Russia, for example, is a world leader in ransomware attacks and the abuse of cryptocurrency, as well as traditional financial intermediaries. Keeping Bitcoin mining in America means that more value will be captured by highly regulated U.S. companies and law-abiding individuals simply interested in optionality when it comes to storing and transferring value.\n\nBitcoin mining has created thousands of jobs. Riot alone employs approximately 500 people, many in Rockdale, Texas, a community previously suffering from the closure of a large industrial aluminum-smelting plant. Riot is now helping to support a program with the Texas State Technical college to upskill the local workforce with programs in computer repair and programming.\n\nBitcoin mining is a bourgeoning industry that\u2019s good for the environment, the economy, and national security. Attacks from nefarious political forces should be rejected to maintain America\u2019s leadership role in the digital economy.\n\nJason Les is the CEO of Riot Platforms, Inc., the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining enterprise in North America by market cap. Brian Morgenstern is Riot\u2019s head of public policy and was a senior adviser and deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury from 2017 to 2020.

        "content": "The exchange giant is joining Fidelity and BNY Mellon in the pursuit of their own cryptocurrency custody platform.\n\nNasdaq, an American stock exchange based in New York City, is reportedly looking at Q2 2023 for the release of its custody services for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Senior Vice President and Head of Nasdaq Digital Assets Ira Auerbach said that Nasdaq \u201cis pushing ahead to get all the necessary technical infrastructure and regulatory approvals in place.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe report describes an infrastructure that might look similar to that of Fidelity Digital Assets, which quietly opened its operations to the public last week. The first step to bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading on Nasdaq would be the custody service for the assets.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg report, \u201cNasdaq has applied to the New York Department of Financial Services for a limited-purpose trust company charter, which would oversee the new business.\u201d\n\n\n\nLaunching just as several major cryptocurrency firms have collapsed, amidst increasing regulatory tension, the goal is seemingly to offer those customers who now have no platform, a regulated, well-trusted American service for bitcoin.\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that many of the issues surrounding exchanges come from the third-party risks presented by a custodian holding bitcoin for customers. The most secure way to interact with bitcoin is to self-custody it with your own wallet. Although trading platforms do offer the ease of interaction created by custodianship, with the American financial system seeing precarious headlines as of late, it is important to consider these trade offs compared with traditional bitcoin self-custody.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin bulls remain bullish, but macro and crypto-specific hurdles have BTC pinned below $30K - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "On March 23, Bitcoin (BTC) price recovered the $28,000 support after a brief correction below $27,000. The movement closely tracked the traditional financial sector, particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index, which gained 2.1% as Bitcoin surpassed the $28,000 threshold.\n\nOn March 22, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25% but hinted that it is nearing its maximum level for 2023. In the end, however, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that it is too soon to determine the extent of the tighter credit conditions, so monetary policy will remain flexible.\n\nInitially, it appears encouraging that the central bank is less inclined to increase the cost of money. However, global economies are exhibiting signs of stress. For instance, consumer confidence in the euro area decreased by 19.2% in March, reversing five consecutive months of gains and defying economists\u2019 predictions of an improvement.\n\nThe recession is still putting pressure on companies\u2019 profits and leading to layoffs. For example, on March 23, professional services company Accenture said it would end the contracts of 19,000 workers over the next 18 months. On March 22, the company Indeed, which helps people find jobs, let go of 2,200 workers, or 15% of its staff.\n\nThe stronger the correlation to traditional markets, the less likely a decoupling. As a result, according to futures and margin markets, the Bitcoin price increase has not instilled much confidence in professional traders.\n\nBulls and bears exhibit a balanced demand on margin markets\n\nMargin trading allows investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their trading position, potentially increasing their returns. For example, one can buy Bitcoin by borrowing Tether (USDT), thus increasing their crypto exposure. On the other hand, borrowing Bitcoin can only be used to bet on a price decline.\n\nUnlike futures contracts, the balance between margin longs and shorts isn\u2019t necessarily matched. When the margin lending ratio is high, it indicates that the market is bullish. The opposite, a low lending ratio, signals that the market is bearish.\n\nOKX USDT/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nOn March 15, the margin markets longs-to-short indicator at the OKX exchange peaked at 60, but by March 17, it had fallen to 22. This indicates that during the rally, reckless leverage was not used. Historically, levels above 40 indicate a highly imbalanced demand favoring longs.\n\nThe indicator is currently at 19, indicating a balanced situation given the high cost of borrowing U.S. dollars (or stablecoins) to short BTC, which stands at 15%.\n\nLong-to-short data shows reduced demand for leverage longs\n\nThe top traders\u2019 long-to-short net ratio excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the margin markets. Analysts can better understand whether professional traders are leaning bullish or bearish by aggregating the positions on the spot, perpetual and quarterly futures contracts.\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so viewers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin likely to outperform all crypto assets following banking crisis, analyst explains\n\nExchange's top traders long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nBetween March 18 and March 22, the top traders\u2019 long-to-short ratio at OKX increased, peaking at 1.09, but reversed course on March 23. The indicator is currently at its lowest level in 11 days, at 0.76. Meanwhile, at the Huobi exchange, the top traders\u2019 long-to-short ratio has stood flat near 1.0 since March 18.\n\nLastly, Binance whales have consistently been reducing their leverage longs since March 17. More precisely, the ratio dropped from 1.36 to 1.09 on March 23, its lowest level in 11 days.\n\nAs Bitcoin has gained 13% since March 16, margin and futures markets indicate that whales and market makers were ill-prepared. This may initially appear bearish, but if the $28,000 support level holds, professional traders will likely be compelled to add long positions, further accelerating the bullish momentum.\n\nBitcoin derivatives ultimately exhibit no signs of stress. Not having excessive leverage on long positions is positive, and bears did not dare to add short positions. Nonetheless, recession risks and growing regulatory uncertainty, such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2018s Wells notice against the Coinbase exchange on March 22, will likely keep the price of Bitcoin below $30,000 for a while.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "The African crypto exchange this 26-year-old launched in 2019 has done $1.75 billion in transactions - CNBC",
        "content": "ACCRA, GHANA \u2013 On the afternoon of Dec. 26, 2022, Chris Maurice finally capitulated and went to the emergency room at Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, just west of the city's gothic quarter. For roughly 10 months, the 26-year-old CEO of the largest centralized crypto exchange in Africa had ignored many of the symptoms consistent with malaria as he bounced between 21 different countries on the continent, advising heads of state on bitcoin adoption and setting up institutional accounts for his business, Yellow Card. By the time Maurice was admitted to the intensive care unit, plasmodium parasites had been wreaking havoc on his red blood cells for nearly a year, multiplying in his liver and threatening to shut down many of his major organs, including his kidneys. His face and eyes were yellow from jaundice. As his hemoglobin levels plummeted in response to the intravenous meds administered as treatment, four days of blood transfusions helped save his life. But to Maurice, his brush with death was simply the price of doing business. Since graduating from Auburn University in Alabama with a finance degree four years ago, he has traded security and stability for a career on the road, all with the goal of fundamentally disrupting Africa's broken financial system. \"I've slept more nights than I can count in the Joburg airport,\" Maurice told CNBC on the sidelines of the Africa Bitcoin Conference in Ghana. \"I've mastered the art of where to go to find chairs with no armrests. I'm six-foot-five, so I need my space.\" For nearly 1.4 million users across the continent, Yellow Card \u2013 which offers an experience similar to Block 's Cash App \u2013 is a vital lifeline to money. \"We wanted to make it as easy as possible for anybody to be able to come on and buy crypto within three minutes,\" explains Maurice in an Uber ride cutting due south through the Ghanaian capital of Accra.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Yellow Card CEO Chris Maurice in Accra, Ghana loading cash onto his Mobile Money account, MoMo. Chris Maurice\n\nFrom there, Yellow Card users can send or receive digital cash in eligible markets. But unlike a centralized exchange like Coinbase , where many customers store their tokens for an extended period of time hoping that their digital assets will appreciate in value, the average customer on Maurice's exchange keeps money on the platform for under five minutes. People take their local fiat currency, turn it into bitcoin or a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin like tether to send it across a border, and the recipient instantly cashes it out. \"It's literally like, I deposit a million Francs in Cameroon, I buy USDT or BTC, and then I send it off,\" continued Maurice. Yellow Card customers can receive cryptocurrency from anywhere in the world and pay only a network fee, which typically ranges from 5 cents to $1, according to Maurice. That is especially helpful for people who would customarily turn to a money service provider like Western Union and MoneyGram, which sometimes charge heavy commissions on remittances. The service is a game-changer for many Africans, who rely on money sent home from abroad, especially in countries where unemployment and inflation is rife. The latest data from the World Bank shows that in Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 where up to 65% of adults are unbanked \u2013 remittance flows reached $50 billion in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. The actual number is likely much higher when you factor in money transferred over informal channels. Meanwhile, World Bank data shows that it is more expensive to send remittances to Sub-Saharan Africa than to any other region in the world. On average, it costs $15.60 (7.8%) to send $200 to or from Africa. That percentage can be as high as $38, or 19%, in some countries. Building the crypto payment rails necessary for Yellow Card requires jumping through a lot of legal and regulatory hoops, which is why Maurice spends about nine months a year in the countries where he operates or plans to launch crypto services. He has local lawyers in pretty much every country on the continent, and he meets with elected officials and regulators to further foam the runway for adoption. The level of hospitality varies widely across the continent.\n\nwatch now\n\nMaurice stands out pretty much wherever he goes thanks to his height and plume of curly black hair. His speech is punctuated with laughs and smiles, and that friendly demeanor puts people at ease. But it's underpinned by an intense work ethic \u2014 he's got a black belt in TaeKwonDo, was an Eagle Scout in his youth and a finalist for Rhodes and Marshall scholarships in college. He also cares deeply about revolutionizing a broken financial system. These traits help enlist supporters for his longshot ideas \u2013 like launching a centralized cryptocurrency exchange in Africa from his dorm room in Auburn, Alabama. Yellow Card has facilitated $1.75 billion in transactions since launching in 2019 and has about 220 employees \u2013 mostly in Africa. The exchange lets users send money to 16 countries on the continent \u2013 and crucially, at the other end of that transaction, the platform has streamlined the process of converting crypto back to local currencies. On a good day, the service will do $5 million in transactions. On a slow day, it is closer to $1 million, according to Maurice. The company has also raised $57 million, including from Jack Dorsey's Block and Valar Ventures, a venture capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel. Maurice says his ultimate goal is to expand service to the rest of the continent and turn Yellow Card into a billion-dollar company, up from its current valuation of $200 million. In practice, that means capitalizing on the exchange's first-mover advantage. \"I realized very early on that there's so much opportunity in all these countries and that we needed to be the first one there,\" said Maurice. \"I drove from South Africa to Botswana, Zimbabwe to Zambia, then flew up to Ethiopia, Ghana, and Uganda. In all of these places, I was doing the grunt work \u2013 things like company registration and opening bank accounts, so that we would be ready to go.\" Maurice doesn't stay anywhere for long, but the transient lifestyle suits him. He's currently in Barcelona, but it's just an apartment in a timezone that lets him take his morning work calls from a desk, rather than the shower. \"I can brush my teeth in peace,\" Maurice says with his trademark smile.\n\nHow money moves in Africa\n\nMoving money in Africa is an expensive and complicated process. Commercial bank branch access is limited, especially for people living in remote and rural areas. Digital banking options are also limited. The latest stats from the World Bank show that just 29% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa uses the internet. Tack on rampant hyperinflation, widespread government corruption, and capital controls trapping domestic cash in banks, and money can stop making sense altogether. \"If someone wants to move money to the country next door, normally, you'd have to fill up a suitcase full of cash and move it over the border,\" explains Ray Youssef, the CEO of Paxful, a peer-to-peer crypto marketplace where users can exchange tokens with one another. Companies like Western Union and MoneyGram offer an expansive physical network of storefronts around the world designed to move money for those who are unbanked. That cash network was extraordinarily difficult and expensive to build, which is why there aren't a lot of direct competitors. It is also why those cash transfers often incur substantial fees. \"The entire system of cross-border payments is all about rent-seeking. That's what it's designed to do,\" argues Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer for the Human Rights Foundation, an organization that works with human rights activists from authoritarian regimes around the world. \"It's not designed to help you move money from A to B. It's designed by someone who's going to make money off you moving money from A to B,\" continues Gladstein.\n\nIf someone wants to move money to the country next door, normally, you'd have to fill up a suitcase full of cash and move it over the border. Ray Youssef Paxful CEO\n\nPart of the problem stems from the continent's quasi-colonial payment framework, in which roughly 80% of cross-border payments originating from African banks are processed offshore, mostly in the U.S. or Europe. That translates to higher costs and processing times that are sometimes measured in weeks. \"The mainstream way of approaching this is, 'Oh, let's just Africanize it. Let's replace the intermediaries over there with intermediaries here,'\" explains Gladstein. \"That's probably even worse because they're going to be corrupt and expensive.\" Across the continent, there are fintech companies built on top of the existing banking system. These platforms abstract away the complicated back-office processes, but the fundamental problem remains. These businesses go through the same legacy payment networks, where they spend a lot of money settling payments \u2014 costs which they then pass on to customers. The Pan-African Payment and Settlement System, or PAPSS, launched in Jan. 2022 with a goal of bringing existing payment systems together under one interoperable network. But it's too early to tell through official metrics whether PAPSS has begun to deliver on its promise of saving African users more than $5 billion in annual transaction fees.\n\nAn employee uses a Nokia 1200 mobile phone inside an M-Pesa store in Nairobi, Kenya, on Sunday, April 14, 2013. Trevor Snap | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nThen there's mobile money, which has been around since the early 2000s. Think of it like an electronic wallet tied to a phone number that does not require a smartphone or data to operate. Users can pay bills and shop with their phone through SMS texting, instead of having to rely on traditional banking options. Africa's mobile money transactions rose 39% to more than $700 billion in 2021, according to data from the GSM Association, a non-profit representing mobile network operators worldwide. World Bank data shows that account ownership at a financial institution \u2014 or via a mobile money service provider \u2014 has more than doubled in the last decade, rising to 55% of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa. But even as adoption proliferates, mobile money users don't get the perks of legacy banking, including earning interest on banked savings and building up a credit score based on a history of spending. Interoperability on the continent also remains a major issue with this alternative way of banking. \"The entire banking system in Africa is completely and utterly broken, even amongst the mobile money providers, the telcos,\" said Youssef from Paxful. \"Two thousand payment networks and only 2% of them talk to each other. That number continues to grow. It's not getting better, it's actually getting worse,\" continued Youssef. Take M-Pesa, short for \"mobile\" and the Swahili word for money \u2014 \"pesa.\" It's Kenya's version of mobile money, and it's incredibly popular there. M-Pesa operates in seven different African countries, but you can't send money from M-Pesa Kenya to M-Pesa Ghana.\n\nA resident checks his phone outside a mobile money kiosk in the Kibera district of Nairobi, Kenya, on Monday, Aug. 1, 2022. Michele Spatari | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\n\"Even on the same network, owned by the same company, because of regulations, those two networks don't talk to each other,\" said Youssef. One solution for moving money across borders is the centralized crypto exchange that Maurice built. The Yellow Card CEO says he would ultimately love to tie in with the Western Union network to help bring those costs for the customer to essentially zero through crypto, given that half of all the world's remittance is still cash on both ends. Another option for making international payments on the continent are peer-to-peer digital asset marketplaces, like the one that Youssef runs. \"People find each other, they do a trade, there's an escrow which removes the trust from at least one side, and the deal is done,\" Youssef told CNBC on the sidelines of the Africa Bitcoin Conference. Paxful has facilitated $5 billion in transaction volume in Africa since it launched, though Youssef says it's only a small fraction of the entire peer-to-peer market. \"Most of it happens on instant messenger, or on the street,\" he said. \"Africans have been doing peer-to-peer finance for a very long time; one might say over 1,400 years. So this is nothing new to them.\"\n\nYellow Card CEO Chris Maurice in a hospital in Douala, Cameroon, recovering from food poisoning after eating cow skins. Chris Maurice\n\nFrom Taco Bell to Nigeria\n\nOn a 15-minute drive from Accra's embassy-heavy Labone District down to the Atlantic Coast, Maurice describes himself as being as Southern as it gets. Before touching down in Nigeria in 2019 to launch his company, the New Orleans native hadn't traveled much beyond the Southeastern seaboard of the U.S. \"My entire worldview was essentially confined to two states \u2013 Louisiana and Alabama,\" said Maurice. \"I had only been on a plane four times before flying to Lagos on a six-day-old passport with no visa and no shots.\" Despite his limited travels to that point, Maurice was no stranger to the difficulties associated with moving money around the planet. Starting in the fifth grade, he used his father's eBay account to sell Pokemon cards and other collectibles online \u2013 a venture that would ultimately cover his college tuition at Auburn. But the business of sending and receiving cash internationally wasn't always straightforward. Some of his customers in Pakistan, for example, weren't able to use PayPal. Bank wires were also not an option. To get paid, Maurice instead had to wait in line at a local Western Union branch. It cost the buyer a hefty fee, and it cost Maurice time \u2013 and gas money. At the age of 18, Maurice turned his attention to bitcoin and soon grew convinced that the world's biggest cryptocurrency was the answer to his problems. It also presented a new business opportunity. In 2015, Maurice and his freshman roommate's best friend, Justin Poiroux, decided to get into bitcoin trading by running their own over-the-counter trading desk out of the Taco Bell on South Gay Street in Auburn. \"We started putting out ads on Craigslist that basically said, 'We have bitcoin. Come give us cash,'\" explained Maurice. Every Wednesday at 7pm, he and Poiroux, a tech-savvy coder, would grab a spot in the back and split a 12-pack of Doritos Locos Tacos while drop-ins would swap dollars for bitcoin. Customers would slap a couple hundred dollars down on the table (bitcoin was trading at around $250 at the time), scan a QR code, and that was it. On the backend, Maurice and Poiroux were using LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer exchange, to carry out the trades. At the time, Maurice says, his OTC desk offered an easier onramp to crypto than Coinbase , whose interface was tough to navigate. Profits came from the arbitrage play between payment methods, since bank transfers and cash had different fees. As for the location? Maurice says he chose Taco Bell because it offered the \"perfect amount of apathy.\" \"This operation would have never flown at a Chick-fil-A,\" he said.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Yellow Card CEO Chris Maurice in Amboseli, Kenya. Chris Maurice\n\nAfter two weeks, business was booming, so they decided to expand the franchise. \"We started calling up friends from high school who were now at LSU, Yale, Georgia, Alabama, anywhere that we knew someone,\" continued Maurice. \"A few weeks later, we had seven Taco Bells on the eastern United States, all within college campuses, where you could walk in and buy bitcoin.\" Four months later, the Taco Bell trading desks were moving thousands of dollars in bitcoin. They weren't too rigorous on the accounting at the time, but Maurice estimates that roughly thirty thousand dollars was exchanged across the entire franchise. \"Then one day, Justin and I were talking and we said, 'Man, we should really do something less sketchy with our lives'.\" Then Maurice had a chance meeting at a Wells Fargo near campus that changed his life. \"I meet this Nigerian guy who is sending $200 to his family, and the bank charged him $90,\" Maurice recalled. \"I'm like, 'Man, have you heard of bitcoin?'\" continued Maurice. \"I explained to him what bitcoin is and how he could try it out by downloading Coinbase.\" There was just one problem: He had no idea what would happen on the other end of the transfer. \"What on earth is this guy's mom going to do with $200 worth of bitcoin?\" he said. \"I started skipping class and researching what the banking system was like in Nigeria \u2013 and the currency,\" said Maurice. \"Could you buy bitcoin in Nigeria? Could you sell it?'\" Maurice and Poiroux decided that the core market for Yellow Card should be the people who stood to benefit the most from an alternative, international payment network that cut out extra transaction fees and wait times. While Poiroux stayed behind in Alabama to continue building and maintaining the tech that fueled the entire operation, Maurice set off to Lagos to establish a physical presence, including laying all of the regulatory groundwork needed to get the business off the ground. Centralizing crypto payments seemed like the obvious thing to do. Up until their launch, peer-to-peer crypto payments on Binance, Paxful, or other more regional exchanges had been the status quo for many wanting to trade and invest in digital tokens. \"Generally, the reason that people use centralized exchanges is for the experience, right? It's significantly easier to use Coinbase than it is to use MetaMask, which involves trying to figure out how to get your own ethereum and store your own keys,\" explains Maurice. Having the edge on general licensing has also put Yellow Card ahead of the competition. \"The amount of local expertise that is required to get some of these payment service providers signed, as well as registering entities and setting up bank accounts \u2014 it is such a different way of doing business than in other parts of the world,\" Poiroux tells CNBC.\n\nYellow Card CEO Chris Maurice on a roadtrip from South Africa, north to Zambia. Chris Maurice\n\nRunning Yellow Card\n\nPoiroux doesn't crave the limelight \u2014 he has always worked behind the scenes, unconcerned with notching public accolades. If Yellow Card were a band, he'd be the drummer or bass player, keeping everything solid in the background while Maurice took center stage as the lead singer. Poiroux started coding when he was 10, because he wanted to make his own video games. But after reading the bitcoin white paper, he became obsessed with the idea of decentralized, unstoppable software. The Yellow Card co-founder and chief technology officer dropped out of college freshman year, and instead holed up in his off-campus apartment teaching himself how to be a full-stack developer through a combination of YouTube tutorials and engineering blogs. It took a year and a half of coding for 16 hours a day for him to build the beta of Yellow Card, and he mostly did it himself. \"If something needs to be built, I will learn, figure it out, and build it,\" Poiroux says, with a hint of a Southern drawl. \"Fairly confident this comes from my background as a farmboy from Alabama.\" Poiroux, who had been on a presidential scholarship to Auburn before quitting school, said he kept his off-campus apartment all four years so that he could still get the college experience of going to bars and football games. His parents eventually got on board after he and Maurice landed their first $100,000 in venture funding. Today, Poiroux runs his own fleet of 40 software engineers across 13 countries who are responsible for keeping the entire operation going. His team is in charge of everything from patching bugs in the code to creating technical workarounds for nationwide internet cuts. \"A lot of the infrastructure dependencies in Africa aren't reliable and so you have to build a lot of logic surrounding it that you wouldn't necessarily, originally think of,\" explains Poiroux. In Zambia, for example, it is not uncommon for the largest mobile phone network, MTN, to go down for two to three days. Extended network downtime means having to deal with pending transactions and bracing for more extreme edge cases. Third-party infrastructure dependency is another big sticking point, particularly when it comes to the availability of the network and the payment service providers. Poiroux first went to Lagos in 2020, and he now makes it back to Africa every three to four months, rotating between Yellow Card engineering hubs in Kenya, South Africa, and Nigeria. Part of what makes Yellow Card so convenient for users is its interoperability with existing banking options, as well as alternative payment service providers, including mobile money. While the platform will custody crypto assets if users want to keep their tokens on the exchange, very few choose to do so. Poiroux emphasizes the fact that they are really more the gateway to crypto.\n\nwatch now\n\nAs the counter-party for all trades, Yellow Card also market makes on the exchange against African currencies, a feature which proves crucial when it comes to reducing price volatility and fairly pricing assets. \"We'll buy several million dollars a day worth of naira,\" Maurice says, referring to the Nigerian local currency. \"We're one of the few companies that will actually take on local African fiats.\" 35-year-old Franklin Okoye, who works in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, earns a living by helping businesses to import goods like clothes and chemicals from China. Okoye says that he and other merchants use Yellow Card specifically because it offers \"very competitive\" market rates when he has to convert between tether and the Nigerian naira. \"We have difficulty in Nigeria here accessing dollars to make payments abroad. So everyone is looking for alternative ways of making payments,\" said Okoye, adding that he swaps more than $1 million worth of naira for tether (and vice versa) on Yellow Card each month. \"Everyone is going to crypto.\" Beyond the remittance use case, many customers use the platform to hedge against inflation and currency devaluation by holding some of their local currency in a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin like tether, according to Yellow Card's director of special projects, Oparinde Babatunde. He thinks that's a big reason why crypto's latest bear market didn't hurt their business \u2014 the need to protect against inflation has only gone up as governments around the world began printing cash during the pandemic. Maurice tells CNBC that Yellow Card's business customers are also using the platform to pay for expenses like their Amazon Web Services bill, and Poiroux added that they have seen some of their retail customers earn money by informally day trading and trying to find arbitrage opportunities between coins. \"We have tons of people who use Yellow Card essentially as a full-time job,\" Poiroux said.\n\nYellow Card CEO Chris Maurice and his Chris Maurice\n\nSpreading the bitcoin gospel\n\nNowadays, Poiroux spends less time in the weeds of coding. Instead, he devotes most of his waking hours to thinking about what comes next and how to scale the business specifically to meet the needs of the people for whom he built the platform. \"Our approach is \u2014 and this has been my approach on the technical side \u2014 to build one solution, one platform \u2014 where we can quickly plug-and-play other functionalities,\" Poiroux tells CNBC from Atlanta, where he's working between visits to his production hubs in Africa. \"Think things like new payment service providers, so that we can scale quickly and make crypto as accessible as possible,\" he said, noting that other crypto payment platforms have taken the opposite approach, hyper-focusing on big markets like Nigeria instead of the entirety of the continent. Poiroux says that in addition to the retail-facing part of the business, the enterprise side of the operation is also a major priority. Yellow Card offers a Payments API that enables companies around the world to collect and disburse funds in Africa without currency devaluation risk. \"The super-cool part is that it uses the same infrastructure as our retail platform,\" Poiroux explains of yet another project he architected and helped to code. \"So if we expand our retail business, we can instantly make that available to the companies that have integrated this service already.\" In the meantime, both Maurice and Poiroux are spreading the gospel of bitcoin pretty much everywhere they go. Last summer, for instance, Maurice advised Central African Republic on adopting bitcoin as legal tender. Maurice and his Cameroonian lawyer were brought to Bangui to meet with the minister of public works, who is in charge of the country's crypto strategy. About halfway through the meeting, the electricity cut out, which meant no AC and no light for the remainder of the conversation. \"We were in a dark room with no windows talking about how the country would be tokenizing everything from their natural resources, to Makumba gorillas,\" Maurice recalls. The conversation didn't miss a beat, because everyone at the table was engrossed in the conversation at hand \u2014 how other countries had been taking advantage of Central African Republic through currency controls for its entire history and how bitcoin presented the country with its first real opportunity to determine its own finances. \"Bitcoin gives them a chance to control their own destiny \u2014 to keep their money outside of foreign banks, in their own country, to use how they see fit,\" Maurice said. \"It really is financial freedom.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rose 4.82% in the week from March 17 to March 24 to trade at US$27,926 at 9:30 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether rose 1.65% in the same period to US$1,772.\n\nv ybYOP1XvhlOvdevPwEHXCsFT7Y1ehXiekUBczy4lVTmqUF0DP5LWQ\n\n\u201cSurging activity on the Bitcoin network is causing profitability to recover to levels consistent with the start of previous bullish cycles. The network is still expensive relative to transaction values but less so than at the start of February,\u201d wrote Jamie Douglas Coutts, senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, in a research note shared with Forkast.\n\nMaxwell Goldstein, the co-founder of Freeport, an on-chain fine art investment platform, said that this week\u2019s price action was mainly driven by the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy decision.\n\nThe Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate by an expected 25 basis points on Wednesday. Bitcoin slid 1.94% to US$27,676 the day after the rate hike, also pressured by market concern of a banking crisis after U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government is not considering a \u201cblanket insurance\u201d on bank deposits.\n\n\u201cTraders are flocking to Bitcoin and similar assets to diversify their holdings. Recent bank failures have also strengthened the case for investing in Bitcoin, along with murmurs of hyperinflation,\u201d wrote Goldstein, adding that due to looming fears of inflation, \u201cinvestors are absolutely seeking a safe haven asset and Bitcoin fits the bill.\u201d\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.17 trillion on Friday at 9:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 2.6% from US$1.14 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$537 billion market cap accounted for 46.3% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$216 billion accounted for 18.6%.\n\nBanks vs Bitcoin\n\n\u201cThe past several months have seen efforts by officials to cut liquidity from the crypto ecosystem, underscoring why Bitcoin matters and how desperate central planners are to keep the fiat credit system from imploding,\u201d wrote Coutts.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoutts was referring to recent black swan events like the liquidation of crypto-focused bank Silvergate, which provided lending services for large crypto companies like Coinbase and Crypto.com.\n\nTwo other crypto-friendly banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, also closed operations in the same week, resulting in market concern that crypto exchanges and companies could go unbanked.\n\nFormer congressman and Signature Bank board member Barney Frank told CNBC on March 13 that the bank\u2019s closure meant that \u201cregulators wanted to send a very strong anti-crypto message.\u201d\n\nThe New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) said the following day that Signature\u2019s closure had nothing to do with crypto and that the decision was \u201cbased on the current status of the bank and its ability to do business in a safe and sound manner.\u201d\n\nCoutts disagreed with the regulator, saying that Signature\u2019s shutdown was a deliberate message for the crypto industry.\n\n\u201cThe bank [Signature Bank] was still meeting withdrawal requests, and [the bank\u2019s] board member Barney Frank said regulators \u2018wanted to send a message to get people away from crypto,'\u201d wrote Coutts.\n\n\u201cThe statement by Frank marries with the data,\u201d added Coutts. \u201cBased on the last reported numbers, unrealized losses from held-to-maturity assets for Signature Bank were 27.4% of book value, below the average for the S&P 500 banks industry group at 36.6%.\u201d\n\nKadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, said that Bitcoin has always performed well during tumultuous times.\n\n\u201cIt would have been reasonable to assume Bitcoin might behave similarly when three crypto-facing banks \u2013 Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank \u2013 collapsed one after another,\u201d he said. Instead of a sharp decline in price, Bitcoin slipped and began to rise. \u201cIf people can\u2019t trust banks, Bitcoin would be a beneficiary.\u201d\n\n\u201cInvestors are scrambling to find safe havens. Gold increased to US$2,000 per ounce. We\u2019ve also seen the world choose Bitcoin as a safe haven,\u201d added Stadelmann.\n\nJonas Betz, a Germany-based crypto analyst, said that Bitcoin was created to hedge against a failing banking system but warned that the closure of crypto banks may lead to a liquidity shortage.\n\n\u201cThe recent closure of operations by Silvergate and Signature has resulted in a significant reduction in liquidity in the crypto markets. These banks provided systems (SEN and Signet) that were important for facilitating the entry of fiat currency into the crypto market. With limited options available, the industry is likely to face a liquidity crunch until new banks step in. This leads to increased volatility in crypto prices,\u201d wrote Betz.\n\nSee related article: Centralized intermediaries were cause of crypto failures in 2022, says Voorhees\n\nBiggest gainers: MASK & FLR\n\nMASK, the governance token of Mask Network, a mobile app and browser extension that aims to bridge Web 2.0 with Web 3.0, was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. The MASK token rose 35.43% to US$6.13 and started picking up momentum on Thursday, after it was listed on CoinMarketCap.\n\nFLR, the utility token of interoperability-focused layer-1 blockchain Flare Network, was the week\u2019s second-biggest gainer in the top 100, rising 15.42% to US$$0.03327. The token started gaining momentum on March 17, after Flare announced the first of 36 monthly airdrops for the community.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin Fear & Greed index rises to 16-month high as investors seek safe-haven assets\n\nNext week: Bitcoin to US$30,000?\n\n\u201cThe 25% rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price from last Friday\u2019s lows has nearly eliminated losses of the previous 12 months for 72.41% of the network\u2019s BTC-holding entities,\u201d wrote Coutts.\n\nAt the start of 2022, some 75% of these entities were profitable. Today, with Bitcoin prices lower than a year ago, the average cost for a Bitcoin entity is lower than price. This has resulted in higher profitability,\u201d wrote Coutts.\n\nSlava Demchuk, the co-founder of AMLBot, a developer of crypto anti-money laundering software, said that investors should monitor the impact of the Fed\u2019s interest rate hike on banks and financial institutions.\n\n\u201cIf [banks] continue to struggle, the Fed may persist in reducing interest rates, which would facilitate even more capital into the economy. This scenario would also impact cryptocurrency prices, as they often reflect these changes faster than the other financial assets,\u201d wrote Demchuk.\n\nFreeport\u2019s Goldstein expects more Bitcoin volatility as the banking crisis unfolds.\n\n\u201cPrices will likely not break through the US$30,000 mark unless another major threat to the U.S. banking system comes into play. If the Fed continues to hike interest rates, Bitcoin will face increased downward pressure,\u201d wrote Goldstein.\n\nAlex Reinhardt, the founder of the financial education platform Reinhardt Academy, said that further banking issues could propel Bitcoin above US$30,000.\n\n\u201cReaching US$30,000 in the next week and US$35,000 in the next 2-3 weeks seems realistic. As we\u2019ve seen in the past, strong growth waves in the crypto market can quickly turn into an avalanche-like movement, triggering both panic sales and panic buying,\u201d wrote Reinhardt.\n\nMarat Minkin, the co-founder of DeFi payment app TONBanking, expects Bitcoin\u2019s safe haven narrative to fuel its rally to above US$30,000.\n\n\u201cKey price level remains at US$28,600-28,750. Bitcoin\u2019s uptrend will continue next week, and the U-turn will be completed at US$32,000 by the end of the next week to close the month with a positive monthly gain,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSee related article: Banks are bringing systemic risks to crypto, says Circle\u2019s Disparte"

        "title": "How to Handle Bitcoin Dust - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "Bitcoin dust is like loose change. A few pennies in the couch cushions won\u2019t grab your attention, but you\u2019ll eventually collect too many to ignore. As with picking up pennies, cleaning up bitcoin dust is a way to reorganize assets. Unlike cents in the couch cushions, however, bitcoin dust can have ramifications for privacy and security.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Dust?\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol has no notion of a net balance in an address. Instead, the Bitcoin ledger is a collection of indivisible bits of \u201cunspent\u201d bitcoin (BTC) called unspent transaction output (UTXO) locked to wallet addresses. So, in your single Bitcoin wallet, you might have a balance of 1 BTC. In actuality, however, it\u2019s comprised of multiple UTXOs, such as:\n\n0.553 BTC\n\n0.238 BTC\n\n0.209 BTC\n\nIf you wanted to spend 0.5 BTC, you would pull from the top UTXO (or your wallet would automatically do this), leaving you with 0.053 BTC in change. If you used that UTXO to send 0.05 BTC, you\u2019d be left with 0.003 BTC. Once that pile of bitcoin dwindles to a number smaller than the transaction fee, it\u2019s dust \u2014 you can\u2019t spend it.\n\nOther Problems\n\nDust isn\u2019t merely caused by transactions you know are coming into and out of your account. When you send 0.5 BTC to a friend or get 0.01 BTC as a tip, that\u2019s one thing. But some people might purposely send a much smaller amount of bitcoin to you and thousands of others. This is known as a \u201cdusting attack\u201d or just \u201cdusting.\u201d\n\nSometimes it\u2019s criminals doing the dusting. They might target anonymous whales as part of an effort to discover their identity, lure them into a phishing scam, or extort them. Law enforcement agencies might dust to find links between wallets suspected of criminal activity. Blockchain analytics firms (e.g., Chainalysis) might dust to better map connections between Bitcoin addresses. Lastly, spammers and advertisers can use dust to attach messages that will arrive in your wallet.\n\nWhile receiving some spare change might seem innocuous, it does present a few issues. First, dust can enable denial-of-service attacks, where the network is flooded with microtransactions to slow it down, manipulate fees, or even crash wallets. However, dusting attacks have become less popular as transaction fees have risen.\n\nMost importantly, bitcoin dust threatens individuals\u2019 privacy. When you consolidate dust from multiple addresses into one, you generally create a link between them that scammers might use to trace someone\u2019s identity and spending patterns.\n\n5 Methods for Getting Rid of Bitcoin Dust\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do anything with your dust. But if you find it untidy or would just like to free up some funds, you have some options (below). We\u2019ve noted the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n\n1. Use a Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet\n\nA hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet uses a single master seed to generate a tree-like structure of new keys with a deterministic algorithm for every transaction. As a result, HD wallets automatically consolidate small UTXOs across multiple wallets into a single larger one. This reduces the number of UTXOs, in turn lowering transaction fees and improving network efficiency. Use HD wallets cautiously, however, as losing the master key can compromise the hierarchy. They also prioritize ease of use over privacy, so consolidation can create links between the wallets; blockchain sleuths can use these links to trace an address to its owner. Ledger, Trezor, and Mycelium are popular HD wallet providers.\n\n2. Use an Exchange to Convert Dust\n\nSome exchanges, like Binance and KuCoin, support the trading of bitcoin dust. The reasonably simple process involves depositing your dust into your exchange account using the provided public Bitcoin address. You can then use bitcoin dust to trade. Some exchanges also feature a dust-conversion tool that exchanges the dust for the exchange\u2019s native token, such as BNB on Binance. One evident downside is privacy \u2014 centralized exchanges generally demand customers provide identifying \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d information before using their services.\n\n3. Dust Off\n\n\u201cDusting off\u201d is the process of adding a small amount of bitcoin to the dust address to make it usable again. You may use an exchange or other Bitcoin wallets for this. Ensure that you add sufficient bitcoin to cover fees when dusting off. Dusting off preserves privacy but incurs transaction fees at multiple steps.\n\n4. Raise Your Dust Limit\n\nThe dust limit of a Bitcoin wallet defines the minimum amount of bitcoin the network can allow in a transaction. This limit fluctuates with network fees. Raising the limit means you are prevented from sending low-value UTXOs, which typically create dust. This method is good for users with surplus bitcoin, as you might need to combine multiple UTXOs to meet your dust limit.\n\n5. Use a VPN\n\nA virtual private network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a remote server, making it difficult for attackers to trace your on-chain activity with other identifiable information. While a VPN can take the sting out of a dusting attack, it\u2019s not a foolproof solution. VPNs are good for privacy in general; use them with other methods mentioned above to add another layer of security.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nBitcoin dust may seem trivial to some users. Thankfully, there are several simple ways to eliminate dust. We encourage you to try some of the methods in this guide to find what works best for you."

        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nIn the wake of the largest international bank collapses since the 2008 financial crisis, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that Bitcoin\u2019s trustless and decentralized nature was created as an antidote to the increasingly unstable banking system, and that these same principles will prove to be an antidote today.\n\nThe first quarter of 2023 has seen a contagious spread of bank collapses, similar to the cascading failures of crypto businesses after FTX\u2019s failure in 2022. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), an essential component of the burgeoning U.S. tech industry, blossomed to manage billions of dollars as it provided essential liquidity for a variety of tech startups. However, since the COVID-19 pandemic, much of the free-flowing investment capital and low interest rates of the 2010s vanished entirely. Anxiety over a downturn in the tech industry mixed with social media panic to create a bank run that brought the place to its knees, and it wasn\u2019t alone. Signature Bank, in New York City, shuttered two days later and days later the Swiss bank Credit Suisse suffered a similar fate.\n\nThese rapid events have been accompanied by a dramatic rise in the valuation of bitcoin, with BTC rising from around $20,000 to $28,000 in a matter of days following the banking crisis. Although Bitcoin has been on a slow and steady recovery since the fallout of the FTX debacle, this represents the strongest jump bitcoin has seen since then. What\u2019s even more impressive is the remarkable way that this boom for bitcoin has come amid a general downturn for the rest of the crypto industry, marked by Circle\u2019s USD Coin (USDC) losing its peg with the dollar and the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) suggesting many crypto assets could come under more regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThen, the fall of Credit Suisse brought a new dynamic to these bank failures, transforming it into a global concern. The global financial industry spent a decade growing cozy around an infrastructure of easy capital and nonexistent interest rates, and both of those things have now apparently been destroyed. Even if the largest banks have yet to fail, the same economic conditions of failure are everywhere. Many of the most painful lessons of the 2008 collapse have slowly been forgotten, but Bitcoin remembers. As the global economic system moves towards deeper and deeper anxiety, it\u2019s important to remember why so many people bet on bitcoin.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

This year, government watchdogs appear to be arriving on the scene to finish the job.\n\nThe past week saw the industry hit with another deluge of enforcement news, from the SEC\u2019s threat to take legal action against Coinbase Inc. and its suit against the Tron blockchain network to the apprehension of crypto fugitive Do Kwon. Even celebrity crypto promoters like actress Lindsay Lohan and rapper Soulja Boy got caught up in the crackdown.\n\nAs the headlines piled up, the developments put a lid on a rally in Bitcoin that had been pushing the oldest token back up toward the closely watched $30,000 level. A glitch Friday morning at crypto exchange Binance took spot trading offline for more than two hours on a platform whose market dominance has only grown as other players have folded, adding to the sour mood. Bitcoin drifted around $27,500 on Saturday.\n\nThe collision course between the US government and crypto true believers\u2019 vision of a system where money can be freely exchanged around the world without \u201ccensorship\u201d by authorities was accelerated by the failure of the Terra blockchain\u2019s stablecoin to maintain its $1 peg and the bankruptcy of FTX last year, which combined to vaporize almost $2 trillion of digital wealth. This month\u2019s implosion of crypto-friendly banks Silvergate Capital Corp. and Signature Bank has added fuel.\n\nAt the center of much of the recent actions is the SEC\u2019s decision to treat many cryptoassets as securities that must be registered with the agency and subject to all the regulations that go along with it. Needless to say, digital-asset aficionados were livid with much of the week\u2019s news flow, especially when it comes to publicly listed Coinbase, which says it has repeatedly tried to engage with the regulator to no avail.\n\n\u201cA reprehensible amount of resources and brainpower have been spent in the US trying to engage with this SEC and trying to create substance and a path out of the wraithlike comments issued by the agency,\u201d Sheila Warren, chief executive of the Crypto Council for Innovation trade group, said in an email. \u201cMeanwhile, most other major economies are actively in productive consultation with experts about how to land the regulatory plane.\u201d\n\nThe treatment of many crypto coins as securities means the SEC is testing its authority, leaving those caught up in its sights an option: capitulate and pay a settlement with the regulator, or fight it in court. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has made it clear that the company will fight the complaint, tweeting that the process will prove \u201cthat the SEC simply has not been fair, reasonable, or even demonstrated a seriousness of purpose when it comes to its engagement on digital assets.\u201d\n\nSix of the eight crypto-touting celebrities \u2013 including Lohan and YouTube prankster-turned-boxer Jake Paul \u2013 decided just to cut the SEC a check after the regulator accused them of touting coins traded on the Tron blockchain without disclosing they were being paid to do so.\n\nDeAndre Cortez Way \u2013 aka rapper Soulja Boy \u2013 and singer Austin Mahone haven\u2019t settled. The celebrities are keeping quiet about the whole issue. (For what it\u2019s worth, the only thing Soulja Boy was hawking this week on Twitter was a pink hoodie featuring a cartoon image of his smiling face. That is almost definitely not a security.)\n\nOf course, some of the crimes being alleged went beyond just dealing in unregistered securities. The case against Justin Sun and three of his companies connected to the Tron blockchain also involves accusations of fraud and market manipulation that artificially inflated the trading volume of tokens by encouraging employees to do more than 600,000 so-called wash trades. Sun wrote on Twitter that he believes the SEC\u2019s complaint lacks merit.\n\nDo Kwon\u2019s indictment in the US, which came shortly after his arrest Thursday in Montenegro, also revealed that the government believes the collapse of his Terra blockchain project was more than just a $60 billion accident. According to prosecutors, Kwon also allegedly engaged in market manipulation and deceived investors about certain aspects of the project. His US lawyer did not respond to a request for comment from Bloomberg.\n\nBy the end of the week, it had all started to look like a drama that could be called \u201cLaw & Order: Web3.\u201d So what will the next episode entail? Many industry watchers are bracing for more shoes to drop.\n\n\u201cOverall, I expect we will see more enforcement news like this in the future given we are operating in an environment with little or no regulatory guidance,\u201d said Duke University finance professor Campbell Harvey.\n\nFor the crypto optimists searching for a silver lining, it\u2019s all about looking at the future instead of the dwelling on the ugliness of the past week. The latest bout of drama in the market \u201ctells us nothing,\u201d according to Aaron Brown, a crypto investor who writes for Bloomberg Opinion\n\n\u201cUseful attention should be directed to the new ships preparing for departure, the ones who will lead the next boom,\u201d he said. Many of the developments of the past week were just \u201cthe flotsam and jetsam washing ashore long after the storm has passed.\u201d\n\nOr maybe Soulja Boy put it best back in his MySpace days when he rapped: \u201cOn the internet, got \u2018em jumpin\u2019 off the wall.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Emily Nicolle"

        "title": "Is Bitcoin the Future of Banking? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Many believe that the recent turmoil in the banking industry is the reason for Bitcoin's (BTC 1.60%) recent jump and why it moved past $28,000 for the first time in nine months. While it might come as a surprise, serving as an alternative to banks is one of the primary reasons Bitcoin was invented. Back in 2009, its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto unveiled Bitcoin to the world as a response to the massive bailout banks received after the fallout of the Great Recession.\n\nTo Nakamoto, it likely comes as no surprise that Bitcoin benefits from the banking chaos in early 2023. Its sole purpose was to provide people with another option to store and send money that didn't rely on the highly opaque and, at times, shady operations of banks.\n\nA novel design to compete with banks\n\nTo fully understand why Bitcoin is benefiting and how it could become a more viable option in the future, we need to examine the characteristics that make it unique.\n\n1. Decentralization\n\nBecause Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, no single entity, such as a government or financial institution, can control it. This high level of decentralization provides users with more freedom, autonomy, and resistance to censorship or manipulation.\n\n2. Financial inclusion\n\nWhile citizens in developed economies have easy access to banking products, people in other parts of the world don't always have this luxury. With Bitcoin, all one needs is an internet connection, and one can send money, pay remittances, and store value without needing a bank.\n\n3. Transparent security\n\nSince Bitcoin operates on a blockchain, all transactions are public and immutable, so they can never be altered or removed. This combination of transparency and security makes transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain easy to verify and trace. As such, the risks of fraud and corruption become almost nonexistent.\n\n4. Privacy\n\nAlthough Bitcoin transactions are public, there's an added level of privacy because transactions aren't linked to any personal information. The only piece of information tied to transactions are public addresses that are in the form of a random, unique combination of letters and numbers. Theoretically, someone could trace all transactions coming from an address, but the likelihood of actually knowing who is behind them remains difficult.\n\n5. Programmable money\n\nThanks to a 2021 update known as Taproot, Bitcoin became able to support smart contract functionality. With smart contracts, various financial processes can become automated and streamlined as they execute predefined actions when particular criteria are met. This inevitably leads to increased efficiency and new business models.\n\nWhile we can only guess, it would be easy to assume that Bitcoin is doing exactly what Nakamoto intended it to. Banks aren't as safe as advertised and are often involved in corruption and malpractice. And when they do fail, they get bailed out while citizens bear the brunt of the fallout. When people begin to realize this, Bitcoin will likely continue garner attention from those looking for a way out of the status quo.\n\nA necessary disclaimer\n\nI'll be the first to admit that the premise of Bitcoin replacing banks remains slightly far-fetched at the moment. Critics of Bitcoin almost always point to the fact that it could never serve as an alternative to traditional banking while its volatility remains so high and deposits held in banks are insured up to $250,000 by the U.S. government.\n\nHowever, these price fluctuations are likely a temporary phenomenon. Volatility is a characteristic of assets with a small market cap. As Bitcoin's overall value begins to grow, its volatility will likely come down.\n\nBut for the time being, it seems that Nakamoto's vision might be unfolding before our eyes, as more people are becoming aware that banks aren't completely free of risk and often use customer funds for speculative activities. Should more turbulence hit the banking sector, Bitcoin might just continue to climb."

        "content": "Bitcoin bounced back above US$28,000 on Friday morning in Asia amid a rebound in all top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies and gains in equities overnight. The market shrugged off the latest warnings from U.S. regulators to crypto platforms. Litecoin led the gains. U.S equities rose on Thursday after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she would take \u201cadditional actions\u201d to protect customer deposits if necessary, following a raft of bank failures this month.\n\nSee related article: Terra-Luna co-founder Do Kwon reportedly arrested in Montenegro\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin rose 3.19% to US$28,225 in the 24 hours to 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, gaining 13.02% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has surged 70% so far this year.\n\nHowever, U.S. dollar to Bitcoin liquidity is worsening due to the shutdown of crypto-friendly banks such as Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank this month that reduced access to U.S. dollar payment services. Bitcoin liquidity fell to a 10-month-low in March, according to a tweet by crypto data platform Kaiko on Friday.\n\nEther climbed 4.12% to US$1,811, a weekly gain of 8.54%.\n\nLitecoin was the biggest winner for the past 24 hours, gaining 7.07% to US$92.86 and up 18.09% for the week. The next halving event of the token is scheduled in August this year and previous halvings have tended to be preceded by price gains.\n\nThe U.S. SEC issued an investor alert on Thursday to advise caution about the risks in \u201ccrypto asset securities,\u201d stating that some providers of crypto investment services are not complying with federal securities laws, adding to the escalating conflict between U.S. regulators and crypto firms.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 3.36% in the past 24 hours to US$1.19 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours dropped 19.78%% to US$55.26 billion.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.21% to 4,120.05 points as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by Forkast sister company, CryptoSlam.\n\nU.S. equities closed higher on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.23%, the S&P 500 gained 0.30%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.01%.\n\nThe rebound in equities followed Janet Yellen\u2019s Thursday testimony to the U.S. Congress, reaffirming that the Treasury would take additional actions to secure bank deposits if necessary. This a day after she backed away from offering a blanket backstop for troubled banks.\n\nOn the inflation front, after the Federal Reserve\u2019s 25-basis-point rate hike on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference that the Fed\u2019s goal to bring annual inflation to the 2% range remains firm, and interest rates will be raised as needed to achieve this.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s next meeting on interest rate is May 3. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 65.8% chance the Fed will keep the rates at 4.75% to 5%. The chance of another 25 basis-point hike is at 34.2%, down from 49.4% on Wednesday.\n\nAhead of the opening of U.S. equity markets on Thursday, stock futures inched higher as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures moved up 0.06%. S&P 500 futures gained 0.08%. The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.01%.\n\nSee related article: South Korea arrests former Coinone exchange official for alleged crypto-listing bribery"

        "content": "Heating pools is expensive. With the UK (and most of Europe) facing soaring energy costs, this could likely exacerbate the draft of pool closures over the next few years.\n\nRunning a data center is also expensive \u2013 it consumes a lot of electricity and produces a tremendous amount of heat. Even a rack of GPUs the size of a small washing machine could generate 40,000 Watts.\n\nWhat do you do with all that heat?\n\nA UK startup is providing an intriguing answer to that question: use it to heat a pool!\n\nDeep Green Technologies, founded by Mark Bjornsgaard, has deployed its \u201cdigital boiler\u201d at the Exmouth Leisure Centre in southwest England where it\u2019s accounting for fully 60% of the pool\u2019s energy usage (saving them an estimated \u00a320,000 a year). It installs the mini data-center for free and covers all the electricity and maintenance costs.\n\nThe pools get their heating for free. So what does the company get out of the deal? Apart from a great deal of good publicity and the ability to move their data centers out of inconveniently-located warehouses, cooling plays a major role: you don\u2019t need to invest in your own liquid cooling solution if you have a large tank of water at your disposal. This is truly a case where one man\u2019s trash (heat) is another man\u2019s treasure (also heat).\n\nAs to their business model, Deep Green rents their compute \u201cfor use in AI training and machine learning workloads.\u201d In other words, crypto. As their whitepaper (read here) makes clear, the goal is to address the serious environmental impacts of global compute using \u201cdata furnaces\u201d (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-data-furnace-heating-up-with-cloud-computing/) \u2013 in short, exactly what they\u2019re doing here: use excess heat for good.\n\nDeep Green also has future plans to install their devices in Bristol and Manchester in the near future."

        "title": "Improving Bitcoin NFT marketplace infrastructure sets the stage for ecosystem growth - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin NFT inscription activity has remained strong with consistency in the daily number of NFTs inscribed on Bitcoin. At the same time, the infrastructure to foster Bitcoin trading is finally coming together with the development of wallets and marketplaces supporting Ordinals.\n\nNFT marketplaces Gamma and Magic Eden added support for Bitcoin NFTs this week. While the initial response of traders has been subdued, the activity is expected to pick up soon.\n\nImproving the infrastructure around Bitcoin NFTs\n\nBitcoin NFTs, also known as Ordinals, began with much fanfare in late January as they enhanced the utility and revenue of the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nDune dashboard from data analyst dgtl_assets shows that the Ordinals inscription activity remains robust, with nearly 580,000 NFTs inscribed in less than three months.\n\nCumulative sum and number of daily BTC NFTs inscribed. Source: Dune\n\nWhile the daily inscription activity is vigorous, the trading volume of Bitcoin NFTs is still muted, which can be primarily attributed to the absence of Bitcoin wallets and supporting marketplaces.\n\nOrdinals require a specially designed Bitcoin wallet that recognizes content files on discernable satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin, and facilitates their transfer. Hiro and Xverse are the leading wallet providers in the space.\n\nMark Hendrickson, the product lead at Hiro, told Cointelegraph that the \u201cactive users for the wallet are up significantly in general this year, around 350%.\u201d The activity picked up significantly since February, thanks to the Ordinals hype.\n\nMeanwhile, Xverse added Ordinals support on February 15. So far, the Xverse Chrome browser extension has been downloaded on over 10,000 browsers and 20,000 mobile wallets, with Hiro\u2019s download numbers surpassing 90,000. Hiro began supporting Bitcoin and Bitcoin NFTs in February.\n\nMarketplaces come together\n\nSince March 19, there has been considerable improvement in the space, with Gamma and Magic Eden launching support for Ordinals trading on March 20 and March 22, respectively. So far, the marketplaces have met with a soft opening with less than $1 million in trading volume on both venues.\n\nIn comparison, OpenSea has facilitated more than $10 million in daily trading volume on Ethereum NFT trades alone on most days in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nGamma users have completed around 182 Bitcoin NFT purchases since launch. In contrast, Magic Eden has done close to 18.94 BTC (worth around $530,000) volume since launch, with the Bitcoin DeGods collection dominating volumes by 67%.\n\nRelated: Stacks (STX) surges as Bitcoin NFT hype grows, but its blockchain activity raises concern\n\nAdditionally, Hendrickson noted that Magic Eden enjoys an advantage in \u201cthe cross-protocol department, given that they\u2019ve previously rolled out support for Solana, Ethereum and Polygon. This could help serve cross-chain trading needs faster, especially as demand increases for moving liquidity across chains to access their various NFT markets.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Ordinals top collections on Magic Eden. Source: Magic Eden\n\nAt the same time, he noted that \u201cGamma has an advantage among Ordinals marketplaces given their deep focus on Bitcoin-based technologies.\u201d Data provided by Hendrickson shows that the number of Hiro users interacting with Gamma surged significantly to around 2,144 weekly users as the hype around Bitcoin NFTs kicked off.\n\nNumber of Hiro clients that connected their wallets to Gamma. Source: Hiro\n\nThe Bitcoin NFT trading activity is expected to pick up. Ordinals provide superior security guarantees than NFT ecosystems elsewhere. The digital media file of Ordinals is stored directly on the Bitcoin blockchain and enjoys the same security guarantees as regular BTC transfers, whereas other ecosystems like Ethereum store the content file of the NFT on third-party storage solutions like AWS and IFPS. Hendrickson noted, \u201cTheir long-term durability is a huge advantage.\u201d\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin Liquidity Hits 10-Month Low Amid US Banking Crisis - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "While Bitcoin\u2019s price has recovered since its March lows, topping out near $28,900, the crisis that caused the initial dip still poses concerns for the market.\n\nThe closure of Silvergate\u2019s SEN and Signature\u2019s Signet network in early March has exposed the crypto market to low liquidity risks.\n\n\u201cLiquidity is king,\u201d an adage in trading circles, is an apt way to describe its importance. It describes a market's ability to facilitate conversion between an asset to fiat currency.\n\nPoor liquidity around an asset leads to market inefficiencies where traders lose money due to events like thin order books, slippage, and larger spreads. It can also cause serious volatility and deter sophisticated investors from placing trades.\n\nKaiko\u2019s head of research Clara Medalie told Decrypt that the current situation is \u201cpretty dangerous\u201d and could manifest in massive price volatility in both directions.\n\n\"A drop in liquidity certainly helps traders to the upside, but there is always eventually a downside,\u201d said Medalie. \u201cThe moment buy pressure subsides, anything can happen to price.\"\n\nCrypto\u2019s liquidity crisis\n\nThe liquidity crisis first manifested with a $200 million drop in 1% market depth after Silvergate\u2019s SEN network was closed, as identified in Kaiko\u2019s latest research note.\n\nThe 1% market depth is calculated by summing the bids and asks within 1% of the mid-price for the top 10 cryptocurrencies. If the market depth is sufficient and order books are crowded around the market price, it reduces the volatility in the market.\n\nThe market depth for Bitcoin and Ethereum is still down 16.12% and 17.64%, respectively, from their monthly opening levels. Kaiko analyst Conor Ryder wrote that \u201cwe are currently at our lowest level of liquidity in BTC markets in 10 months, even lower than the aftermath of FTX.\u201d\n\nBTC and ETH 1% market depth in March 2023. Source: Kaiko .\n\nThe liquidity crunch is also causing inefficiencies such as high slippage and larger spreads. Coinbase\u2019s BTC-USD pair currently exhibits nearly three times higher slippage than at the start of March.\n\nStory continues\n\nSlippage refers to the price at which an order is placed and the final price once that order is actually executed. In low liquidity environments, the difference between these two orders can be much larger than usual.\n\nGrowing List of Crypto Companies Cutting Silvergate Ties\n\nThe most liquid pair in the crypto market, the BTC-USDT pair on Binance, also suffered a blow after the exchange ended its zero-free program.\n\nAs a result, the pair\u2019s liquidity depleted by 70% as market makers moved to greener pastures.\n\nThese conditions have deterred market makers and sophisticated day traders from placing trades because of the additional costs incurred due to market inefficiencies, worsening the low-liquidity environment.\n\nThe need for fiat on-ramps\n\nThe market share of fiat dollars and stablecoins has also drastically shifted, with stablecoin volumes on centralized exchanges rising from a 77% share of volumes to 95% in just over a year.\n\nThe trend accelerated swiftly after the closure of crypto banking networks.\n\nStablecoin market share (blue) in March 2023. Source: Kaiko .\n\nWhile shifting to stablecoin trading pairs does not create an issue for medium to small-scale investors, it can become a problem for more sophisticated traders.\n\nMedalie explained that USD networks are essential to traders, who are required to settle their traders daily.\n\n\"Stablecoins are not ideal from a risk management perspective, especially to settle at the end of the day or week,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if banks close and don't process transactions, then stablecoins are the next best alternative.\""

        "title": "Despite a recent string of bad news for the crypto industry, Wyoming still wants its business - Wyoming Public Media",
        "content": "It\u2019s been a tough year for cryptocurrency, a decentralized digital payment system that uses coding to verify transactions. The collapse of the massive exchange FTX made international headlines, and multiple other companies in the industry have recently failed. Signature Bank , which focused heavily on crypto, also failed, and the price of major coins crashed earlier this month .\n\nFor many of those in the crypto industry, the recent criticism and negative press attention is well-deserved.\n\n\u201cI'm not going to defend the activity of the criminals and scammers of this industry,\u201d said Caitlin Long, a massive crypto supporter. \u201cIn fact, I've been very public, calling them out.\u201d\n\nLong is a Wall Street veteran and current CEO of Custodia Bank. She got fully involved with the technology a few years ago after she tried to donate to her alma mater, the University of Wyoming, with Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. She couldn\u2019t because of the state\u2019s laws, and then quickly discovered that there was an opportunity for Wyoming.\n\n\u201cWe're not going to try to be on the coattails,\u201d Long said. \u201cWe can actually lead in something here.\u201d\n\nSince then, Long has been instrumental in making Wyoming one of the most crypto-friendly states in the country . In the past few years, state lawmakers have passed a couple dozen laws trying to attract new crypto businesses to the windswept Cowboy State, including one this year that would authorize the state treasurer to issue its own digital currency.\n\nLong said crypto has brought new people and jobs to Wyoming, which has struggled for years to diversify its economy beyond the energy industry.\n\n\u201cThis is incredible. I'm seeing people coming from Denver, as opposed to our kids going to Denver the other way around,\u201d she said.\n\nOther Western states have also tried to stay ahead of the curve. Colorado was the first state to accept cryptocurrency to pay taxes , and one study ranked Nevada as the best state for crypto enthusiasts due to its friendly laws and high number of employees in the sector.\n\nBut some experts are questioning whether states should be trying to attract crypto.\n\n\u201cThese crypto assets are not tied at all to the real economy,\u201d said Chris Odinet, a law professor at the University of Iowa. \u201cThere are not merchants and commercial firms with consumer and commercial goods and supply chains behind them. So then I think you have to ask, what really is this for?\u201d\n\nAt the center of this debate is the fight over whether crypto should be a part of banking. Wyoming is the first state to grant companies the ability to house digital currencies alongside fiat currencies under one roof. Fiat currencies are backed by a government, rather than a physical commodity like gold or silver. This is called a Special Purpose Depository Institution ( SPDI ). Importantly, those crypto assets are backed by cash reserves, but Odinet said they still might not be a good idea.\n\n\u201cAllowing banks themselves \u2013 pre-existing banks \u2013 to provide crypto investment or crypto custodial services is, in my view, a grave mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if the 2008 financial crisis taught us anything, it's that keeping bank banking simple is really a pillar of avoiding financial harm and the contagion that can follow.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the Federal Reserve Board denied the membership application of Long\u2019s Custodia Bank. They said the firm\u2019s focus on crypto presented too many safety and soundness risks . Long was not a fan of that decision, and litigation about how the Fed handled Custodia\u2019s application is pending .\n\n\u201cBizarrely, the Biden administration decided to make an example for the rest of the crypto industry of Custodia,\u201d Long said. \u201cIf they really wanted to solve the crypto problem, frankly, they ought to look at the laws that the Wyoming legislature in their wisdom passed.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Congress is trying to regulate digital assets. Wyoming\u2019s junior senator, Cynthia Lummis has been called the \u201c Crypto Queen ,\u201d and recently introduced the Responsible Financial Innovation Act with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y).\n\n\u201cIt will take our existing financial regulatory structure and just lay cryptocurrency assets on top of it,\u201d Lummis said during a recent press call.\n\nThe U.S. Senate has yet to take action on the bill. For self-described skeptics like Odinet, there is a place for cryptocurrency and, especially, its underlying technology, blockchain \u2013 but in a more limited capacity.\n\n\u201cI understand and agree that banks will and should play a role in supporting crypto firms, but only like they support any other commercial enterprise,\u201d Odinet said.\n\nIn a recent letter regarding Wyoming\u2019s cryptocurrency laws, Gov. Mark Gordon exemplified both a nervousness and excitement he has regarding digital assets. Many state residents, including investors in Bitcoin, will likely be treading carefully in the next few months and weighing whether or not crypto is a valuable asset to their community.\n\n\u201cFirst movers are not always rewarded. They are, however, vital to progress,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story was produced by the Mountain West News Bureau, a collaboration between Wyoming Public Media, Nevada Public Radio, Boise State Public Radio in Idaho, KUNR in Nevada, the O'Connor Center for the Rocky Mountain West in Montana, KUNC in Colorado, KUNM in New Mexico, with support from affiliate stations across the region. Funding for the Mountain West News Bureau is provided in part by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\n"

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes the current decoupling of BTC\u2019s price to the equity markets may attract more institutional investors into Bitcoin over time. As for the impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price from institutional interest, Wood expects that most firms would allocate between 2.5% to 6.5% of their investment portfolios to BTC by 2030, taking the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s price to $1\u20131.5 million.\n\nARK Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood says the behavior of the Bitcoin's price through the latest banking turmoil will attract more institutions and investors https://t.co/2d8cT7SX3n pic.twitter.com/Eaymh05lhq \u2014 Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) March 21, 2023\n\nThe impact of the Credit Suisse bank crisis on the crypto market\n\nHow to analyze banks and avoid inaccurate market capitalization indicators \u2014 such as the $15.8 billion value of Silicon Valley Bank?

Discover SCENE\n\nAs Greenpeace USA took to Twitter to proclaim the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s \u201cravenous consumption of fossil fuels\" and unveil a unique new artwork, die-hard Bitcoin supporters were unanimous in their criticism of the campaign.\n\nThe organization teamed up with Canadian art activist Benjamin Von Wong to unveil the \"Skull of Satoshi\"\u2014an 11-foot skull with red eyes, smoking stacks on its head, and an army of shadowy super-coders at its base.\n\nThey're demonizing nuclear energy now?

It's all general-purpose computer motherboards, some CPU heatsinks, a couple old af PCI Ethernet NICs, maybe some old af pre-Bitcoin GPUs? Hilarious,\u201d wrote notgrubles while asking whether Greenpeace is demonizing nuclear power now.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChanging Bitcoin's code\n\nThough the installation is new, the \"Change the Code, Not the Climate\" initiative it represents was first floated a year ago.\n\nThe primary objective is to get Bitcoin to transition from its currency proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm to a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake (Pos) mechanism.\n\nSome climate activists think #Bitcoin is just fake internet money they can safely ignore.

Individuals, including Greenpeace, need only reach consensus among developers after filing a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, or BIP. From there, the proposal would also need to win over the mining community, convincing them to operate using the newly-updated software.\n\nBut as the infamous block-size wars, a years-long battle to increase how much data could be stored in each of Bitcoin's blocks, changing the network's code is easier said than done.\n\n\u201cAnyone can #ChangeTheCode. Just like anyone can change the rules of chess,\" responded one of the commentators. \"Go ahead, good luck finding anyone to play with.\u201d\n\nVon Wong also tweeted, \"PoS will never work for Bitcoin. It goes against its decentralized ethos!\"\n\nTotally agree with you! PoS will never work for Bitcoin. It goes against its decentralized ethos!

        "title": "UK crypto companies call for help to break a banking barrier - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT\u2019s Cryptofinance newsletter. This week, we\u2019re looking at the UK and crypto\u2019s banking crisis.\n\nThe demise of crypto\u2019s favourite American banks has slimmed the industry\u2019s access to the traditional financial system, fuelling theories that crypto is being run out of town, at least in the US.\n\nFewer banks accepting crypto means fewer places for companies to park their customers\u2019 assets. But this trend \u2014 dubbed \u201cOperation Chokepoint\u201d by a fevered few on social media \u2014 isn\u2019t stopping at America\u2019s borders. British banks are going cold on crypto, too.\n\nNatWest and other large UK banks have imposed limits on how much money can flow to and from crypto exchanges. Citing a challenging regulatory environment, online payments provider Paysafe recently said it would wind down services to UK customers of Binance, the largest trading shop crypto has to offer.\n\nCoupled with the wobble in America, the trend has set off alarm bells. Lobbying group CryptoUK this week wrote to the UK\u2019s economic secretary Andrew Griffith expressing \u201cdeep concerns\u201d about blanket bans and restrictions of transfers from UK banks to crypto asset platforms.\n\nThe group urged the government to \u201cfind a path forward\u201d and consider facilitating meetings between banking and crypto C-suite heads.\n\nOne can see why they think it\u2019s worth a shot. The UK government has been explicit about embracing crypto.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m selling the UK as a place to set up shop, but if you can\u2019t get banking support, what\u2019s the point? Potential newcomers will just not bother coming here,\u201d Ian Taylor, CryptoUK board advisor, told me over the phone.\n\nLisa Cameron, an MP who is the chair of the all-party parliamentary group for crypto, told me she raised crypto\u2019s banking issue with Kevin Hollinrake, parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department for Business and Trade.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s counterintuitive to the UK\u2019s crypto vision. De-banking the industry could undermine the UK remaining an international hub of fintech,\u201d she said.\n\nIn my view, the more pressing issue is whether banks \u2014 in their aversion to risk \u2014 are actually doing more of a disservice to UK consumers.\n\nThe risk is that the business will just be carried out offshore, where it\u2019s harder to track down money or executives. As we have seen in the past year, companies in offshore jurisdictions can still sting customers. FTX in the Bahamas and Terraform Labs in Singapore are prime examples.\n\nThe banks already do know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering checks for crypto companies in the UK. Authorities in Britain have not been explicit at all about the risks to banks in accepting crypto business, unlike in the US. So what has changed?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a moral hazard. It\u2019s not good consumer protection,\u201d said one industry professional who works in London. \u201cThe banks are not accepting that they play an important part in protecting people from fraud.\u201d\n\nBut asking banks to embrace crypto remains a hard sell. A bank\u2019s choice of its customer is a decision made by a private, commercially minded company.\n\n\u201cMy concern is the hyperbole will, over time, be negative for crypto because it makes the industry look a little bit like it\u2019s throwing its toys out the pram,\u201d said one person who works in London\u2019s crypto scene.\n\nCryptoUK doesn\u2019t help itself when its members generate their own regulatory controversies. One prime example is Binance, which the Financial Conduct Authority decided was incapable of being effectively regulated after the exchange failed to supply the agency with basic information.\n\nCryptoUK said it \u201cproactively engages\u201d with members when negative feedback from regulators is received, and would offboard a member if issues \u201cgo unresolved.\u201d\n\nIn any case, one individual familiar with Westminster\u2019s approach to digital assets told me recently that the government was not concerned with being first on digital assets, nor was it swayed by any advantages afforded to a first mover.\n\nLet someone make the mistakes first and then pick up the pieces, they said. So no matter how many turn out to fight in crypto\u2019s corner in the halls of Westminster, it might all fall on deaf ears.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on the UK\u2019s crypto tug of war? Email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nWeekly highlights: US assault on crypto\n\nAuthorities in Montenegro arrested Do Kwon, co-founder and chief executive of Terraform Labs, the company behind the terraUSD and luna tokens whose collapses sparked last year\u2019s epic crypto market crash. The country\u2019s interior ministry said Kwon was arrested for using a forged passport from Costa Rica on his way to Dubai. To top it off Kwon was then indicted on criminal charges in the US late on Thursday. Read my story \u2014 together with colleagues Marton Dunai and Joe Miller \u2014 here.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission sued crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, whose companies include Tron and BitTorrent, as well as a host of celebrities for improperly touting crypto tokens.\n\nThe White House let rip at crypto too. In an annual economic report it said \u201ccrypto assets currently do not offer widespread economic benefits\u201d and that much of the crypto activity was covered by existing regulations.\n\nSushiSwap, a decentralised finance project, says it has been subpoenaed by the SEC. A social media post this week is looking to establish a defence fund to pay legal fees.\n\nSoundbite of the week: Coinbase vs SEC\n\nIt was not a good week for Coinbase. The Securities and Exchange Commission told the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange it was considering a potential enforcement action over possible securities laws violations. Coinbase said it covered its staking products, in which customers agree to lock up their tokens in other crypto projects, in return for a high yield.\n\nIts shares fell 13 per cent on Thursday. Check out my story with Stefania Palma here. That led to a furious online pushback from the company, led by chief legal officer Paul Grewal. He said on Twitter:\n\n\u201cWhen Coinbase filed to go public in 2021, our S1 described our business in much detail, including 57 references to staking and details on our asset listing process. The SEC approved us to go public, knowing those details. Now they have changed their mind on what is allowed.\u201d\n\nOne can sympathise to a degree; Coinbase has been offering these products openly for years and has other SEC licences.\n\nBut that SEC S1 \u2018approval\u2019 only applies to the accuracy of the disclosures. In the risk section of that filing Coinbase warned about legal uncertainty over several of its products. It even highlighted one in particular. \u201cFor example, there is regulatory uncertainty regarding the status of our staking activities under the US federal securities laws,\u201d it said.\n\nMaybe Coinbase\u2019s management was taken aback by the SEC\u2019s move but the lawyers who wrote the S1 could not have been surprised.\n\nData mining: Open interest on Deribit reaches all-time high\n\nThe world\u2019s largest crypto options exchange isn\u2019t Binance but a little-known exchange called Deribit. You might recall Deribit helped push Three Arrows Capital into liquidation, claiming the hedge fund had failed to repay it $80mn.\n\nAccording to data provided by the exchange, open interest on the platform has exceeded $20bn this week for the first time. More than $18bn of positions are options on bitcoin and Ethereum. Options give investors the right but not the obligation to buy the coins by a set date in the future.\n\nMost calls expire at the end of March and the majority of these contracts have a strike price of $30,000. That suggests crypto investors are optimistic, at least for the next week.\n\nCryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford.

        "content": "Tesla customers can now buy its electric vehicles with bitcoin, its boss, Elon Musk, said on Wednesday, marking a significant step forward for the cryptocurrency's use in commerce.\n\n\"You can now buy a Tesla with bitcoin,\" Musk said on Twitter, adding that the option would be available outside the United States later this year.\n\nThe electric-car maker said last month it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and would soon accept it as a form of payment for cars, in a large stride toward mainstream acceptance that sent bitcoin soaring to a record high of nearly $62,000.\n\nAlso read: Elon Musk tells China data gathered by Teslas remain secret: report\n\nBitcoin, the world's biggest digital currency, rose more than 4% after Musk's tweet and was last trading at $56,429.\n\nMusk said bitcoin paid to Tesla would not be converted into traditional currency, but he gave few other details on how the bitcoin payments would be processed. The company was using \"internal & open source software\", he said.\n\nMost mainstream companies such as AT&T Inc and Microsoft Corp that allow customers to pay with bitcoin typically use specialist payment processors that convert the cryptocurrency into, say, dollars and send the sum to the company.\n\nLike other cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is still little used for commerce in major economies, hampered by its volatility and relatively costly and slow processing times.\n\nMusk, who regularly posts comments on Twitter about cryptocurrencies, last month criticised conventional cash, saying when it \"has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn't look elsewhere\".\n\nHe had said that the difference with cash made it \"adventurous enough\" for the S&P 500 company to hold the cryptocurrency.\n\nFollowing Tesla's investment in bitcoin, companies including Mastercard Inc and Bank of New York Mellon Corp have embraced the emerging asset, sparking predictions that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will become a regular part of investment portfolios.\n\nRead more: Tesla's in-car cameras raise privacy concerns: Consumer Reports\n\nUber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the ride-hailing company discussed and \"quickly dismissed\" the idea of investing in bitcoin. However, he said Uber could potentially accept the cryptocurrency as payment.\n\nGeneral Motors Co said it would evaluate whether bitcoin could be accepted as payment for its vehicles.\n\nTesla recently added \"Technoking of Tesla\" to Musk's list of official titles."

Bitcoin has been viewed as a risk-on asset while also serving as a potential financial lifeboat in the event of a banking crisis.\n\nAs a result, it has benefited from recent market turmoil, and there is now the possibility that the Federal Reserve\u2019s tightening may come to an end, further boosting Bitcoin\u2019s prospects.\n\nAll of this is a positive sign for the whole market, while BTC & ETH can surely expect some nice returns, you should still consider them as a long-term investment only.\n\nWe will now go over some projects that can provide you with much larger returns in a shorter time frame.\n\n>>>Get the Best Presale Project Now<<<\n\nLove Hate Inu (LHINU)\n\nIt seems that everyone loves a good debate these days, and the makers of LHINU have harnessed that energy to create a unique platform.\n\nThe LHINU project is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency that allows individuals to express their opinions on various topics.\n\nIts innovative voting system and meme coin features make it a game-changer in the online survey industry.\n\nThe LHINU presale has already raised over $1,3 million with experts predicting the potential for significant returns, similar to striking gold in a mine.\n\nInvestors believe LHINU has the potential to generate returns of over 60x their initial investment within two years.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now<<<\n\nFight Out (FGHT)\n\nFight Out is a new play-to-earn fitness project that aims to encourage gamers to adopt a healthier lifestyle by providing an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience.\n\nIt features a safe platform where players can compete against each other using unique soulbound NFT avatars, reflecting the player\u2019s real-life training.\n\nFight Out offers players a chance to test their physical strength in a virtual world.\n\nThe presale offers an opportunity to secure FGHT tokens at a discounted price.

        "title": "Will Bitcoin (BTC) reach new ATH in 2023? Here's why Ethereum (ETH) and RenQ Finance (RENQ) will follow the suit - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, has had an unprecedented year in 2021. From its low of around $4,000 in March 2020, Bitcoin reached its all-time high (ATH) of over $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nHowever, since then, Bitcoin\u2019s price has been fluctuating, and it has failed to reach a new ATH. This has left many investors wondering if Bitcoin will ever reach new ATH in 2023.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the factors that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching new ATH in 2023 and how Ethereum and RenQ Finance may follow the suit.\n\nThe Bitcoin Market Cap\n\nThe first factor that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching a new ATH in 2023 is the Bitcoin market cap. As of writing, Bitcoin holds the top position in the cryptocurrency market capitalization rankings, with a value of more than $534 billion.\n\nWhile this may seem like a lot, it\u2019s important to note that the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is around $1.16 trillion according to coinmarketcap. This means that Bitcoin accounts for less than half of the total cryptocurrency market cap.\n\nWith the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors and corporations, we may see a significant increase in the Bitcoin market cap. This increase in the market cap may push Bitcoin\u2019s price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nInstitutional Adoption\n\nThe second factor that may contribute to Bitcoin reaching new ATH in 2023 is institutional adoption. Over the past year, we have seen a significant increase in institutional adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nCompanies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square have all invested billions of dollars in Bitcoin. In addition, we have seen the launch of Bitcoin futures on major exchanges like CME Group and the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Canada.\n\nWith more institutions investing in Bitcoin, we may see a significant increase in demand for Bitcoin, which may push its price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nEthereum and RenQ Finance\n\nWhile Bitcoin may be the focus of many investors, it\u2019s important to note that other cryptocurrencies may follow the suit. Ethereum and RenQ Finance are two cryptocurrencies that may see significant growth in the coming years.\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it\u2019s often referred to as the \u201cworld computer.\u201d Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and is used to build decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum\u2019s value proposition is that it can do everything that Bitcoin can do, but it can also execute smart contracts. With the increasing adoption of DeFi and the launch of Ethereum 2.0, we may see a significant increase in the demand for Ethereum, which may push its price to a new ATH in 2023.\n\nRenQ Finance is a relatively new cryptocurrency that has gained significant attention in the crypto space. RenQ Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide a one-stop solution for all kinds of traders under one platform in the DeFi world.

        "title": "Bitcoin System Review 2024 - Is it Legit or a Scam? - CoinJournal",
        "content": "Factors to Consider Before Using Bitcoin System\n\nTrading bots work slightly differently in theory than in practice. This is why we tested the bot in various areas that we believe are important to traders\u2019 everyday operations to see how the bot performs. Here are our findings:\n\nVerification System: 4.4/5\n\nThe signup process on Bitcoin System is straightforward. As described on its website, new users will require a government-issued ID and proof of address document like a utility bill. This is to pass the KYC process which is a must for all your account to prevent impersonation and fraud.\n\nWe found the verification process to be quick and easy. The platform did not ask for more information than was necessary to verify our identity. The process took about 20 minutes to complete.\n\nHowever, note that you will also be required to sign up with a partner broker when creating an account with Bitcoin System. These brokers are said to be regulated by internationally recognized regulatory agencies and will also require KYC documents.\n\nWithdrawal Process: 4.1/5\n\nBitcoin System does not have any minimum or maximum withdrawal requirement. withdrawals also take roughly 24 hours to complete once a withdrawal form has been submitted. Sometimes, the withdrawal time is less than 24 hours, but we cannot guarantee this as it depends on the total withdrawal volume and the withdrawal amount.\n\nWe found the withdrawal process to be adequate. Upon our first withdrawal, we were asked to verify our identity once more to ensure that the owner of the account was the one initiating the withdrawal.\n\nNote that while there are no limits with Bitcoin System, your payment provider e.g., banks or electronic wallets may impose certain limits.\n\nCosts and Fees: 5/5\n\nBitcoin System can be considered a cheap trading companion. The platform does not charge fees for everyday activities like deposits and withdrawals; however, they charge a 2% Commission for profit on the bot\u2019s profits.\n\nOur experience corroborates these claims as we were not charged for any of the activities. However, the bot works with its partner brokers to include a markup on the bid-ask spread for CFD pairs.\n\nUser Testimonials: 5/5\n\nUser testimonials for Bitcoin System have generally been positive. While there have been a few reviews and comments expressing difficulty with using the bots, most of the reviews have been positive.\n\nWe ensured that we did not count testimonials on the bot\u2019s website as those may be biased. We only used testimonials from high-quality websites with strong domains and websites that have proven neutrality towards products and services.\n\nCustomer Service: 3/5\n\nCustomer service on Bitcoin System was adequate, although, non-account holders might find it difficult to get in touch with the team. The communication channels provided are only shown to account holders, so potential users who may want to get in touch with the team may be at a disadvantage.\n\nAffiliated Brokers: 5/5\n\nThe brokers that Bitcoin System partners with are said to be regulated by the Cyprus Securities Exchange Commission (CySEC). While this is true for some, we cannot guarantee that all brokers are certified. Ensure you research the broker you are given before signing up for an account with them.\n\nDeposit Methods and Limits: 4/5\n\nBitcoin System accepts deposits in USD, GBP, and EUR through channels like bank transfers, credit card payments, Bitcoin, and electronic wallets like PayPal. All accounts are subject to a $250 minimum initial deposit requirement.\n\nWe were able to deposit funds into our account easily. However, we found that credit card payments were the fastest and most widely used method as credit card companies automatically converted from local currency to any of the supported currencies."

        "title": "Bitcoin [BTC]: Derivatives demand soars, but what are its implications - AMBCrypto News",
        "content": "Bitcoin demand in the derivatives market takes advantage of inflows fueled by banking collapse.\n\nSell pressure may put a cap on the latest rally and trigger some long liquidation, but investors are exiting.\n\nMarket events so far this month can teach investors a lot about Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] demand characteristics, especially those related to the derivatives market. The same observations might come in handy when making informed market decisions.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nTo recap, Bitcoin\u2019s jump from 10 March was fueled by a surge in accumulation due to the loss of confidence in the banking sector. The higher confidence was particularly evident in the derivatives market. Both the Binance open interest and funding rates metrics bounced back strongly on 12 March to a new monthly high by 19 March.\n\nBoth metrics confirm a robust demand influx from the derivatives market. But what about the demand for leverage? Bitcoin\u2019s estimated leverage ratio pivoted at around the same time as the other derivatives market. It grew slightly, which may indicate that market confidence is still not as high. However, it could also mean that those willing to use leverage were still relatively few.\n\nPerhaps the best example of the impact of the leverage level in the market is its impact on price changes. For example, long liquidations soared to 304.54% on 22 March due to the surge in sell pressure. Moreover, shorts dropped by a noteworthy margin during the last few days.\n\nThe Bitcoin bear narrative is re-emerging\n\nBTC long liquidations also dropped sharply in the last 24 hours. This might be due to investors exiting their positions, especially now that Bitcoin is interacting within an ascending resistance line. We have seen the return of sell pressure above the $28,000 price level.\n\nBTC has also been flirting with overbought conditions according to the RSI and the same applies for its MFI. This increases the chances of sell pressure pushing down the price, thus explaining why traders are exiting their positions.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nThe risk of more sell pressure is further exasperated by outflows from whale addresses. Addresses holding over 1,000 BTC peaked on 20 March and have trimmed their balances substantially since then. This is a sign that whales have been cashing out their short-term gains.\n\nThe above observations highlight a higher likelihood of the bears successfully pushing down Bitcoin\u2019s price in the next few days. However, this will depend on whether there will be any new events that may accelerate the selloff or trigger a potential pivot. If the latter occurs, then Bitcoin\u2019s next major target will be the $30,000 price range."

        "title": "Why are Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) pumping? Why is it good for projects like RenQ Finance (RENQ)? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. In recent weeks, both coins have been experiencing an upward trend. The question on everyone\u2019s minds is, why are these coins pumping?\n\nAccording to the report, which aimed to explain the sudden surge in the values of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the influx of capital from institutional investors has been the driving force behind the price pump. Since February 2023, these investors have injected approximately $1.6 billion into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin is often referred to as the king of cryptocurrencies, and for good reason. It is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, with a market dominance of over 40%. BTC has seen significant growth in recent years.\n\nThere are several reasons why Bitcoin is currently pumping. One major factor is institutional adoption. Large companies and financial institutions are starting to invest in Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. This has led to a surge in demand for BTC, which in turn drives up its price.\n\nAnother factor contributing to Bitcoin\u2019s rise is the limited supply of cryptocurrency. Only 21 million BTC will ever exist, and with a growing number of people wanting to own it, the supply-demand dynamics come into play, causing the price to increase.\n\nEthereum (ETH)\n\nEthereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it is often referred to as the platform for decentralized applications (dApps). ETH has also been experiencing significant growth, with its price increasing steadily over the past few weeks.\n\nOne reason for Ethereum\u2019s recent rise is the growing popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. These applications are built on the Ethereum blockchain, and they allow users to lend, borrow, and trade cryptocurrencies without the need for a centralized intermediary. As DeFi continues to gain traction, demand for ETH will likely increase, driving up its price.\n\nAnother reason for ETH\u2019s rise is the recent launch of Ethereum 2.0. This upgrade to the Ethereum network promises to improve its scalability, security, and energy efficiency, making it more attractive to developers and users. This has led to increased optimism and interest in the platform, which in turn drives up the price of ETH.\n\nWhat is RenQ Finance?\n\nRenQ Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aims to bring new and innovative financial services to the blockchain ecosystem. It is a community-driven project that provides users with a suite of tools and products that enable them to participate in the emerging DeFi economy. The platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain and supports a wide range of assets, including ERC-20 tokens and popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nRenQ Finance offers a variety of services, including yield farming, liquidity provision, lending and borrowing, and more. The platform\u2019s primary product is the RenQ Vault, which allows users to earn high yields on their crypto assets by automatically investing them in a variety of DeFi protocols.\n\nThe RenQ Finance platform is governed by its community, with proposals and decisions made through a voting process. RenQ token holders can participate in governance and propose changes to the platform. This ensures that the platform is transparent, democratic, and driven by the community.\n\nWhy is it Good for Projects like RenQ Finance (RENQ)?\n\nThe recent price surges of BTC and ETH have had a positive impact on the entire cryptocurrency market. As the two largest cryptocurrencies, they set the tone for the rest of the market. When BTC and ETH are doing well, it typically signals a bullish sentiment in the market, which can lead to increased demand for other cryptocurrencies, including RENQ.\n\nAdditionally, the growing popularity of DeFi applications built on the Ethereum blockchain, such as Uniswap and Aave, has created a demand for interoperability between different blockchain networks. This is where projects like RenQ Finance come in. RenQ Finance is a multi-chain DeFi platform that allows users to access liquidity across different blockchain networks. As the demand for interoperability increases, platforms like RenQ Finance are well-positioned to benefit.\n\nFurthermore, the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin is a signal of the maturing cryptocurrency market. As more large companies and financial institutions start investing in cryptocurrencies, it brings more legitimacy to the industry and increases the chances of regulatory clarity. This can lead to a more stable and predictable market, which is good for all projects in the long run, including RenQ Finance.\n\nClick Here to Buy RenQ Finance (RENQ) Tokens.\n\nVisit the links below for more information about RenQ Finance (RENQ):\n\nWebsite: https://renq.io\n\nWhitepaper: https://renq.io/whitepaper.pdf\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

The company has also clarified that other digital assets like tokenized securities will be added in the near future.\n\nDwpbank\u2019s move will potentially put pressure on other German banks and financial institutions to meet the growing demand for convenient access to crypto trading and investing."

        "title": "Can Bitcoin reach $1 million in 90 days? Expert analyzes Balaji's forecast - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate conversations in the financial world, having capitalized on the crisis in the United States banking system to reach a new multi-month high. The recent performance has prompted industry experts to offer projections on Bitcoin\u2019s potential price action in the coming days.\n\nOne such projection was made by venture capitalist and former CTO at crypto exchange Coinbase, Balaji Srinivasan, in a tweet on March 18.\n\nBalaji believes that Bitcoin will reach $1 million within 90 days due to the U.S. economy entering a phase of hyperinflation while warning that the world is likely to witness massive changes catalyzed by the devaluation of the dollar.\n\nHowever, analyzing the viability of Balaji\u2019s prediction, Matthew Kratter, founder of the Trader University YouTube channel, termed the forecast as \u201cover the top\u201d but \u201cdirectionally correct,\u201d as shared by MicroStrategy chair Michael Saylor in a tweet on March 24.\n\nAccording to Kratter, while he views Balaji\u2019s forecast as a marketing ploy, the probability of Bitcoin hitting $1 million in three months is 1-2%, but the asset has the potential to reach such price levels in the long term.\n\n\u201cI think he is right about Bitcoin going to a million dollars. I\u2019ve talked about Bitcoin going to $5 million or $10 million per coin, just probably not in the next 90 days. I think this is a bit of a marketing ploy. If Bitcoin were to move to $1 million per coin in the next 90 days, I think that would be a terrible thing. It would actually be a sign that something major is broken,\u201d he said.\n\nDrivers of Bitcoin to $1 million\n\nKratter suggested Bitcoin at $1 million remains in play, noting that the asset is increasingly becoming attractive as a safe haven due to its lack of counterparty and debasement risks, which are prevalent in other assets. He noted that all other assets, including cryptocurrency, technology stocks, bank stocks, stock indices, and gold, are rapidly losing value when measured against Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is everything is crashing against Bitcoin this is another way of saying that people are fleeing into Bitcoin. <\u2026> The entire financial system is unraveling, and savings and capital are being moved into Bitcoin. <\u2026> It\u2019s actually beginning to look like the Bitcoin network can\u2019t be stopped even during the financial crisis,\u201d Kratter added.\n\nFurthermore, the author pointed out that gold, another safe-haven asset, is losing market share to Bitcoin and is depreciating relative to the maiden crypto. In his view, gold has failed to provide the security that investors are seeking during this crisis.\n\nInterestingly, Kratter believes that Balaji\u2019s forecast may be an attempt to bolster his personal reputation by aligning himself with Bitcoin\u2019s coming success. Nevertheless, Kratter acknowledges that the current financial crisis and the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cturning the money printers back on\u201d make Bitcoin an attractive option for investors.\n\nWhile Kratter acknowledges that Bitcoin has limitations, such as its limited use as a form of payment and concerns about the security of exchanges and wallets, he predicts that the asset is likely to trade at $100,000 in the next three months and potentially hit $1 million by the end of the current decade.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAfter weeks of rallying, Bitcoin is facing resistance at $30,000. By press time, BTC was trading at $27,628 with daily losses of almost 2%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nThe current Bitcoin price follows an inflow of capital that elevated the asset\u2019s market cap to hit $531.717 billion. In this line, Bitcoin is on the verge of reentering the top ten category of assets by market cap globally.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
