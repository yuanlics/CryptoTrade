        "content": "Why do Bitcoin halvings happen?\n\nThe goal of halvings is to stabilize bitcoin's ability to act as a store of value. Let's explore what that means.\n\nBitcoin was created to be an alternative to traditional fiat currencies like the US dollar. One of the disadvantages of fiat currencies, according to crypto advocates, is that they may not be not reliable stores of value due to inflation. Your dollar bill may be worth $1 today, for example, but in 10 years, that same dollar could only hold $0.70 of purchasing power.\n\nIn contrast, crypto advocates believe bitcoin is a currency that will maintain or grow its value over time, meaning anyone can buy and hold without fear of inflation. Of course, skeptics believe this is not a realistic claim.\n\nOne way the Bitcoin network hopes to achieve this is through its hard cap of 21 million bitcoin, meaning there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in existence. Unlike the central bank model that fiat currencies are subject to, where an unlimited amount of new money can be injected into or withdrawn from the system, bitcoin's absolute supply is limited.\n\nBut how it reaches that 21 million hard cap also matters. Recall that new bitcoins are released into circulation through mining rewards. Every time a miner adds a new block to the blockchain, the total number of bitcoins in circulation inches closer to the 21 million max.\n\nIt is commonly viewed that injecting new money supply into circulation can cause inflation. Bitcoin hopes to avoid this through the halving, which allows it to reduce the amount of new supply that is released as time goes on. The hope is that this strategy will curb inflation. Whether it's effective over the long run remains to be seen."

        "content": "The founder of SkyBridge Capital, Anthony Scaramucci, is known for many things, including his entrepreneurial endeavors, investment acumen, and a brief stint at the White House.\n\nIn recent years, investors have come to learn that Scaramucci is a big believer in the future of digital assets, specifically Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin: Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin could be a hedge against higher inflation and a national debt that has to be monetized, Scaramucci told Benzinga.\n\n\u201cI think those things will have value over time,\u201d he said of Bitcoin and digital assets during a recent appearance on \u201cThe Raz Report.\u201d\n\nScaramucci said, unlike other assets, you can\u2019t inflate away the value of Bitcoin given its fixed supply. The investor said Bitcoin might be the only asset on the planet with higher demand that can\u2019t have the supply increased.\n\n\u201c [If] you have higher demand for gold, we\u2019ll build more mines. Bitcoin has a finite supply.\u201d\n\nScaramucci told Benzinga that he has a couple of hundred million dollars invested in the cryptocurrency space, including holding Bitcoin on the SkyBridge and his own personal balance sheet.\n\nThe investor also partnered with FirstTrust to launch the FirstTrust SkyBridge Crypto Industry and Digital Economy ETF (NYSE: CRPT) in 2021.\n\nThe ETF \u201chas publicly traded companies that are linked to digital assets,\u201d Scaramucci said.\n\nA look at the top holdings shows the following five companies:\n\nMicroStrategy Inc (NYSE: MSTR): 23.9%\n\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN): 21.2%\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT): 9.2%\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA): 8.4%\n\nGalaxy Digital Holdings (OTC: BRPHF): 7.4%\n\nRelated Link: Trump's Former Communication Director Casts Doubt On FTX's Revival\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: Like other Bitcoin investors, Scaramucci is optimistic about the cryptocurrency's potential price surge, a sentiment that could be bolstered by future Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nScaramucci said that nobody knows where the price of Bitcoin is heading, but a look at SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) ETF could illustrate what inflows into Bitcoin ETFs could do. Scaramucci highlighted that when investments poured into the gold ETF, gold's price rose. He suggests that as financial institutions venture into Bitcoin through ETFs, a similar trend might occur.\n\nIf Bitcoin ETFs do $100 billion in allocation to Bitcoin, the price of the cryptocurrency could go to $150,000 or $250,000, Scaramucci added.\n\n\u201cI believe it could.\u201d\n\nScaramucci mentioned many stocks that have gone up by 10x or more in the past and added that Bitcoin going to $150,000 to $250,000 is only a five to eight-bagger. \u201cIf I\u2019m right, we could be sitting at $150k, $250k Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCatch the full episode of Anthony Scaramucci on The Raz Report Friday at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nRead Next: Exclusive: Mark Yusko On Bitcoin's Future, 2024 Price Target\n\nMeet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga's exclusive event - Future of Digital Assets.

        "content": "Top 10 Bitcoin Mining Countries & Their Renewable Electricity Mix\n\nBitcoin miners use an estimated 348 terawatt hours of electricity per year, and with the world increasingly moving to renewables, some are asking the question: just where does Bitcoin get its electricity?\n\nTo answer that question, we partnered with HIVE Digital to visualize data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance and Ember, a climate-oriented energy think tank, to look at the Bitcoin network\u2019s electricity mix.\n\nThis is part one in our How Green is Bitcoin? series, which examines the cryptocurrency\u2019s sustainability.\n\nThe World According to Bitcoin\n\nThe top 10 countries for Bitcoin mining represent 93.8% of the entire network by hashrate\u2014a measure of computational power\u2014with the U.S., China, and Kazakhstan rounding out the top three. Together these three countries hosted nearly three-quarters of the network at the end of 2021.\n\nCountry Hashrate (%) Renewable (%) U.S. 37.8% 22.5% China 21.1% 30.2% Kazakhstan 13.2% 11.3% Canada 6.5% 69.7% Russia 4.7% 18.5% Germany 3.1% 43.0% Malaysia 2.5% 19.1% Ireland 2.0% 38.6% Singapore 2.0% 2.4% Thailand 1.0% 15.5% Rest of the World 6.3% 30.1%\n\nSource: Hashrate (%): Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance as of December 2021; Renewable (%) Ember, as of 2022.\n\nChina used to be the top spot for Bitcoin mining, up to 75% of global capacity, but a crackdown in the summer of 2021 saw their share drop to nil in just a couple months. Many miners relocated to nearby Kazakhstan, attracted by cheap electricity, loose regulations, and a \u2018stable\u2019 political climate, while others opted for the United States. A sizable covert mining scene has also emerged in China, now that the dust has settled.\n\nAt the bottom of the top 10 are Ireland, Singapore, and Thailand, which together host 4.9% of the network. Ireland\u2019s reported share\u2014and this applies to sixth-place Germany, as well\u2014is thought to be a significant overstatement caused by miners in other countries masking their true locations.\n\nThe Role of Renewables\n\nOn a national basis, the U.S., China, and Kazakhstan each had renewable shares of 22.5%, 30.2%, and 11.3% respectively. For context, renewables made up 30% of the world\u2019s electricity generation in 2022 (not including nuclear).\n\nKazakhstan\u2019s dismal renewable share is due to their heavy reliance on coal (60%), which is also a major export of the central Asian country. At the same time, coal contributes a similar amount of the electricity in China (61%), but their overall renewable share is higher because of their breakneck expansion of wind and solar power.\n\nWagons Ho?\n\nJust where a Bitcoin miner sets up their rig is important, because unlike many other industries with factories or big head offices, they are mobile (Google \u2018Bitcoin mining shipping containers\u2019 if you need convincing).\n\nWhere they choose to put out their shingle is based on things like the regulatory regime, price of electricity, and because Bitcoin rigs generate a lot of heat, the average outdoor temperature. On this last point, here is how the top 10 breaks down by mean annual temperature:\n\nIncreasingly, though, with climate change driving the push to renewables, many Bitcoin miners are looking more closely at where their electricity is coming from. This could be why Canada\u2014with its embarrassment of hydroelectric riches\u2014has crept up the ranking from less than one percent of the network in 2019, to six-and-a-half percent at the end of 2021.\n\nBut considering that top renewable countries such as Iceland, Paraguay, and Norway together only hosted just over one percent of the global network, there\u2019s still a lot more room left for growth."

        "title": "Just How Popular Could a Spot Bitcoin ETF Be If Approved by SEC? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency community has been buzzing with excitement as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers whether to approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This potential crypto milestone begs the question: How popular would a spot Bitcoin ETF be if approved by the SEC? In this essay, we will look at the relevance of a spot Bitcoin ETF, its possible impact on the cryptocurrency market, and the factors that may influence its level of investor popularity.\n\nUnderstanding the Bitcoin ETF Spot\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF is intended to give investors exposure to the underlying asset, Bitcoin, without requiring them to own the cryptocurrency itself. In contrast to futures-based ETFs, which derive their value from Bitcoin futures contracts, a spot Bitcoin ETF would hold the real cryptocurrency, allowing investors to purchase shares in the ETF and indirectly possess Bitcoin.\n\nThe simplicity and accessibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF are what make it appealing. It would allow traditional investors, both institutional and retail, to obtain exposure to Bitcoin via a familiar financial instrument. Investors could buy and sell shares of the ETF via existing stock exchanges, avoiding the intricacies of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets.\n\nPotential Crypto Market Impact\n\nThe SEC's approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF might have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Here are some of the primary ways it could affect the market:\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nLiquidity: A spot Bitcoin ETF would very certainly attract large institutional and retail investment. This inflow of capital may enhance liquidity in the Bitcoin market, allowing investors to buy and sell Bitcoin at competitive prices.\n\nLegitimization: The SEC's approval of a Bitcoin ETF would represent regulatory acceptance and legitimacy for Bitcoin as an asset class. This could encourage additional institutional investors to enter the bitcoin industry, further validating it.\n\nMarket Volatility: While increasing liquidity can help stabilize prices, it may also increase short-term volatility as more investors enter the market. Traders may strive to profit from market volatility, causing Bitcoin's price to rise and fall.\n\nPrice discovery: the location The daily trading of Bitcoin ETFs would provide a transparent and controlled price discovery mechanism for Bitcoin. This could contribute to the establishment of a widely recognized and established benchmark pricing.\n\nPopularity Influencing Factors\n\nIf approved, the popularity of a spot Bitcoin ETF would be determined by various criteria, including the following:\n\nRegulatory Environment: The SEC's regulatory approval is critical. Investors are eagerly expecting the SEC's judgment, which will have a huge impact on the ETF's popularity. The SEC's approval would almost certainly spark a boom in interest and investment.\n\nCustody and Security: Investors will be concerned about the ETF's Bitcoin custody and security. Gaining investor trust would require a respected custodian and robust security procedures.\n\nFees and Expenses: The ETF's cost structure, including management fees, will influence its appeal. Lower fees may entice price-conscious investors.\n\nMarket mood: The popularity of the ETF will be influenced by market mood and investor opinion. Demand for the ETF may be driven by positive sentiment and excitement surrounding Bitcoin.\n\nThe competitive landscape is important. If numerous spot Bitcoin ETFs are allowed, investors will have more options, and popularity may be distributed among them.\n\nAccess to Bitcoin: The simplicity with which investors can purchase ETF shares on traditional stock exchanges will be essential. The extent to which the ETF is adopted can be determined by its accessibility.\n\nConsiderations for Investors\n\nCertain concerns must be kept in mind by investors considering a prospective spot Bitcoin ETF:\n\nRisk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency investments, including ETFs, carry some risk due to market volatility. Investors should evaluate their risk tolerance and deploy their funds accordingly.\n\nConduct extensive research on the ETF's provider, custodian, and security measures. Make sure you understand how the ETF works and what fees are involved.\n\nRegulatory Updates: Stay up to date on regulatory events, which can have a substantial impact on the ETF's prospects.\n\nConsider how a spot Bitcoin ETF might fit into your whole investment strategy. Diversification can aid in risk management.\n\nLong-Term vs. Short-Term: Determine whether you want to invest in Bitcoin for the long term or for a short-term trading opportunity. Your investment horizon should correspond to your objectives.\n\nThe Unique Bitcoin Outlier: How a Bitcoin ETF May Not Follow the Crypto Trend\n\nUnlike most other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has established itself as a household name and a digital gold standard. While it has weathered extreme price volatility, it remains a favorite among investors and corporations looking to diversify their portfolios. This unique position raises questions about how a Bitcoin ETF might behave.\n\nThe answer is not straightforward. The performance of a Bitcoin ETF is not guaranteed to correlate with other cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their high volatility and susceptibility to speculative trends, which might not align with Bitcoin's more stable reputation. Therefore, a Bitcoin ETF could chart its own course, largely independent of the broader crypto market.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF may also exhibit more resilience during times of market turbulence. Its established status and recognition by mainstream investors could offer a level of security that other cryptocurrencies do not enjoy. Consequently, it could serve as a safe haven asset within the crypto realm, further distancing itself from the pack.\n\nInvestors and crypto enthusiasts should remain vigilant and avoid presuming that a Bitcoin ETF will mirror the erratic behavior of lesser-known digital assets. Its status as a crypto outlier is firmly established, and this trend may persist within the ETF market, potentially delivering unexpected results. As the crypto landscape evolves, understanding these unique dynamics will be key for those seeking to navigate the exciting but unpredictable world of digital assets.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe SEC's probable approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has sparked great interest in the cryptocurrency industry as well as among traditional investors. Its relevance stems from the fact that it provides a simple and regulated mechanism for investors to obtain exposure to Bitcoin. The ETF's popularity is determined by a combination of regulatory variables, investor sentiment, fees, and competition.\n\nWhile investors await the SEC's ruling, it's critical to approach any investment in a spot Bitcoin ETF with caution, bearing in mind the inherent dangers and potential of the cryptocurrency market. If approved, the ETF would be a big step forward in the convergence of traditional finance and the realm of cryptocurrencies, potentially allowing a new wave of investors to engage in the digital asset revolution."

Read preview\n\nPentagon officials monitoring a Bitcoin operation in Wyoming that sits across from a Microsoft data center and a nearby military base are worried that the owners' ties to China could pose a national security threat, per The New York Times.\n\nMicrosoft believed the location could allow the Chinese government to \"pursue full-spectrum intelligence collection operations\" directed at the data center and the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base, which houses ICBMs.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThe crypto mining operation first came under the US government's purview after a team at Microsoft submitted a report to the Committee on Foreign Investment in August 2022. The team believed the mining operation had the potential to collect information from the data center, which supports the operational needs of the Pentagon, the Times reported.\n\n\"Microsoft has no direct indications of malicious activities by this entity,\" Microsoft wrote, per the Times. \"However, pending further discovery, we suggest the possibility that the computing power of an industrial-level cryptomining operation, along with the presence of an unidentified number of Chinese nationals in direct proximity to Microsoft's Data Center and one of three strategic-missile bases in the US, provides significant threat vectors.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2021, China banned the resource-intensive practice of Bitcoin mining . Businesses in the cryptocurrency market scrambled to establish themselves in other countries, including the US.\n\nThe Times identified mines in 12 states that were owned by Chinese nationals. Per the outlet, some had ties to the Chinese government, some did not, and others could not be easily traced.\n\nThe Cheyenne, Wyoming, center was one such mine, per the Times. The Times reported that the mining operation is linked to five different companies, with one company, Bit Origin Ltd., previously registered as a pork-processing company in the Cayman Islands.\n\nLi Jiaming, the president of Bit Origin Ltd., said that the Microsoft data center or the nearby military base had nothing to do with why the area was chosen. Instead, the mine was placed there because a local utility company agreed to work with Bit Origin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Even though we are a Microsoft neighbor and a couple of miles from the base, without power it is nothing \u2014 the business cannot succeed,\" Jiaming told the Times.\n\nOfficials who spoke with the Times cited concerns that the mines, which use an immense amount of electricity in their operations, would be used to purposefully overwhelm electrical grids to cause planned blackouts and complete other cyberattacks."

        "content": "Investor appetite for ether futures exchange-traded funds has remained muted, despite a surge in new listings.\n\nSix new ether futures funds from Bitwise Asset Management, ProShares and VanEck launched on Oct. 2. As of Thursday's close, all six funds have posted losses of 5% or greater since their debuts.\n\nThe broader outlook for crypto is partly to blame, Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, told Bob Pisani on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" last Monday.\n\n\"When [the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) ] generated a billion dollars on its launch of bitcoin futures, that was because it was brand new,\" said Edelman. \"Frankly, bitcoin was doing fabulous at the time in 2021 and a lot of folks really didn't understand exactly what that fund was, being bitcoin futures. You fast-forward a couple of years, people have learned a lot.\"\n\nThe six ether futures funds that debuted Oct. 2 attracted just $1.92 million collectively on their first day of trading, according to LSEG. When the BITO ETF \u2014 a futures product based on bitcoin \u2014 launched in late 2021, it saw approximately $1 billion of inflows in its first two trading days alone.\n\nCryptocurrencies underlying the futures-based products are still well off their all-time highs reached in November 2021. Bitcoin is hovering near $27,000 \u2014 more than $40,000 below its peak \u2014 while ether is down more than 60% from its high, currently valued near $1,500.\n\nEdelman added that the nature of futures ETFs may be keeping some investors on the sidelines.\n\n\"People are recognizing, 'I don't ordinarily buy futures, so if I'm not buying futures in the stock market, why would I buy futures in the crypto market?'\"\n\nCurrently, regulators are weighing the approval of cryptocurrency spot ETFs that trade based on the current market price of the underlying asset, rather than futures contracts.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has previously blocked spot bitcoin ETFs from coming to market, but a federal appeals court in August overturned a ruling that would prevent Grayscale from converting its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The SEC has until Friday to appeal the decision.\n\nAccording to Edelman, consumer safety is at stake.\n\n\"The absence of a spot bitcoin ETF isn't stopping people from buying crypto. It's just forcing them to pay for exotic products that cost more and have less liquidity and higher risk,\" he said.\n\nDisclaimer"

The structure of ETFs allows for a creation-redemption model which means new ETF shares can be created to meet demand or redeemed to reduce supply."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nLatest Prices\n\nTop Stories\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has outperformed other cryptocurrencies amid macroeconomic uncertainty, partially due to traders pricing a potential approval of spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to Coinbase Institutional. \"We think the divergence in the performance of bitcoin and other tokens shows that the potential approval of one or more spot bitcoin ETPs has already been partially priced in. That makes it less clear how much more bitcoin could outperform if a favorable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision occurs,\" David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase Institutional, said in the latest monthly report sent to subscribers on Thursday.\n\nU.S. regulators have targeted former Voyager Digital CEO Steve Ehrlich with lawsuits claiming he engaged in fraud and deliberately misrepresented his customers\u2019 government protections. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced related actions against Ehrlich on Thursday, with the CFTC also including in its court filing that Circle's USDC stablecoin and bitcoin as commodities. The CFTC accused Ehrlich of defrauding customers by misleading them about the strength of the company and doing business without proper registrations. The FTC said he lied about customers\u2019 funds being protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\nCaroline Ellison, 28, wrapped up her testimony on Thursday, her third day of questioning in the Sam Bankman-Fried trial. Sporting the same gray blazer as the last two days, Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend was asked about her company's accounting. Alameda engaged with a few accountants in 2021 to 2022, but after those firms reviewed Alameda's books, \"they found they couldn't or wouldn't do it,\" Ellison said, as she faced questions from Attorney Mark Cohen. Former FTX Digital Markets CEO Ryan Salame initially prepared Alameda's balance sheets, but at some point, Ellison took over this task, she testified. The company's financials are at the center of Bankman-Fried's demise. An award-winning CoinDesk story in November 2022 that cited Alameda's confidential balance sheet caused many to doubt the viability of Alameda and FTX.\n\nStory continues\n\nChart of The Day\n\nThe chart shows the Ethereum mainnet's daily fee revenue since early 2020.\n\nFees have reached the lowest since the DeFi boom of Summer in 2020.\n\nThe decrease is putting ETH's \"ultra sound money\" thesis to a test, according to IntoTheBlock.\n\nSource: IntoTheBlock\n\n- Omkar Godbole\n\nTrending Posts"

        "title": "In an Increasingly Controlled World, Bitcoin Stands as a Beacon of Freedom - U.S. Global Investors",
        "content": "Private property rights and freedom of speech are fundamental human rights, and yet\u2014as many people in Canada, Europe and elsewhere are discovering\u2014they are among the most fragile. If we fail to remain vigilant and take these rights for granted, we risk losing the privilege of owning our own property and expressing our own thoughts and opinions.\n\nSo said conference-goers who were kind enough to chat with me following my presentation this week at Bitcoin Amsterdam, Europe\u2019s largest Bitcoin event.\n\nI spoke about the differences between common law and civil law, using two island-nations\u2014Singapore and Cuba\u2014as case studies for both legal systems. A former British colony, Singapore embraced common law and free markets and therefore saw its GDP per capita surge from around $3,600 at the start of Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s decades-long rule to above U.S. levels today. Over the same period, Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba\u2014held back by a centralized/communist economy, strict state controls and lack of economic diversification\u2014has experienced next to no growth. (You can read my 2015 article on the subject here.)\n\nFrom the Magna Carta to the Bitcoin Whitepaper\n\nDuring my presentation, I also traced the trajectory of common law from the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 to the ratification of the U.S. Bill of Rights in 1791 and, eventually, the arrival of the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008.\n\nThink about it: The Magna Carta was primarily designed to prevent kings from abusing their power and unjustly seizing their subjects\u2019 private property. Similarly, Bitcoin was created to protect individual\u2019s wealth in the digital age. Whereas the former laid the groundwork for the rule of law and the rights of individuals in the face of centralized power, the latter seeks to extend these principles into the realm of digital finance and beyond.\n\nIt should come as little surprise, then, that Bitcoin conferences typically attract human rights activists such as the Human Rights Foundation\u2019s (HRF) Alex Gladstein, Togolese writer Farida Nabourema, North Korean defector Yeonmi Park and others.\n\nCommon and Civil Law Countries\n\nSeeking Financial Freedom\n\nDespite the guardrails, many people worry that their basic rights are under threat\u2014and in some very notable cases, they are.\n\nIn the last couple of years, everyday Canadians have had their bank accounts frozen for legally protesting vaccine mandates. They\u2019ve had stricter regulations and censorship of online content imposed on them, and, more recently, they\u2019ve seen global news providers restrict access to Canadian users.\n\nHere in the Netherlands, the world\u2019s second-largest exporter of food, farmers gathered in March to protest the government\u2019s draconian crackdown on nitrogen emissions, fearing it would result in the culling of thousands of heads of cattle. Irish farmers were forced to do the same in July.\n\nMeanwhile, there are growing concerns that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will one day be used to monitor and control people\u2019s spending habits. Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank (ECB), admitted as much back in April, saying that CBDCs would give governments some measure of \u201ccontrol.\u201d\n\nThese examples represent breaches of the proverbial social contract in mostly high-income countries. In many parts of the so-called Global South, the situation is even more dire, with flagrant human rights abuses, currency collapses and political instability driving people to flee their homes in search of safety and a better life. Why else are we seeing record numbers of Venezuelan asylum-seekers turn up at the U.S.-Mexico border and huge waves of North Africans wash up on the banks of Italy?\n\n\u201cBitcoin fixes this\u201d is a common refrain at conferences like the one in Amsterdam. The digital asset may not end up as the panacea that many of its biggest advocates claim it is, but its decentralized nature, resistance to censorship and ability to empower individuals in the face of increasing government controls can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nThe 1970s Strikes Back\n\nAs more and more people become disillusioned with traditional systems, the appeal of decentralized alternatives like Bitcoin becomes evident. That\u2019s especially true now that there are signs we may be entering an era of 1970s-style stagflation (high inflation coupled with high unemployment), triggered by stubborn consumer prices, spiking bond yields, rising oil costs, workers\u2019 strikes, record debt levels, unexpected Chinese weakness, a malfunctioning U.S. government and two wars.\n\nIndeed, the parallels are striking.\n\nIn October 1973, Egyptian and Syrian forces unexpectedly attacked Israel in a bid to recover territory they lost to the country just six years earlier. Launched on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, the short yet bloody conflict had significant economic consequences, including the first of two major oil crises of the 1970s, a global recession and a decade of stagflation.\n\nAlmost exactly 50 years later, a similar engagement is playing out after Hamas militants, in a surprisingly well-organized assault, successfully breached Israel\u2019s border with Gaza, capturing a number of Israeli settlements for the first time ever and taking soldiers and civilians hostage.\n\nWith Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of a \u201clong and difficult war,\u201d can we expect the same global consequences as before?\n\nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank appear to believe so. The bank forecasts a mild recession in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2024 as geopolitical risks remain elevated and rates stay high for an extended period of time, among other factors.\n\nIn its World Economic Outlook, out this week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also predicts lower rates of economic growth and strongly urges governments to cut deficit spending. Doing so, the IMF says, will take some of the pressure off central banks in their mission to tame inflation.\n\nHousing Least Affordable in Recent Memory\n\nOne of the most glaring signs that the economy isn\u2019t working for everyone is the historic drop in housing affordability in the U.S. With 30-year mortgage rates now topping 8% in some cases, many Americans are priced out of owning their own home. According to real estate data provider ATTOM, single-family houses in a whopping 99% of U.S. counties are out of reach for the average American earning around $75,000.\n\nTake a look at the chart below. Housing affordability has fallen even deeper below the magic 100 line for the first time in recent memory, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). (A value of 100 means that a family earning a median income makes just enough to afford a new home. A value under that means that new homes are no longer affordable.)\n\nFactors such as the increase in home prices and mortgage rates have pushed the standard portion of wages required for primary homeownership costs to 35%, ATTOM says. This is significantly higher than conventional lending standards, which recommend a 28% debt-to-income ratio. Basic homeownership expenses now consume more than a third of average wages.\n\nThe lessons of history, whether from the Magna Carta or the events of the 1970s, remind us of the cyclical nature of societal and economic shifts. As I said earlier, Bitcoin may not be a magic solution to all our problems, but I believe it represents a tool to safeguard our freedoms and assets in an unpredictable landscape.\n\nIndex Summary\n\nThe major market indices finished mixed this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.79%. The S&P 500 Stock Index rose 0.40%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.18%. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index lost 1.50% this week.\n\nThe Hang Seng Composite gained 1.87% this week; while Taiwan was down 1.59% and the KOSPI rose 1.97%.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury bond yield fell 18 basis points to 4.622%.\n\nAirlines and Shipping\n\nStrengths\n\nThe best performing airline stock for the week was Embraer, up 3.4%. According to ISI, passenger throughput was up14% year-over-year on capacity up 10% year-over-year. The group estimates load factors have firmed over the last two weeks.\n\nAccording to ISI, Euronav has confirmed that its two largest shareholders, with a total voting stake of 53% of the company, have agreed to transactions that ultimately change the direction of the company. Frontline will sell its 26.12% stake then acquire 24 modern ships from Euronav for $2.35 billion.\n\nDelta Air Lines reported September quarter-end adjusted EPS of $2.03, above FactSet consensus of $1.95 and near the high end of the company\u2019s latest $1.85 to $2.05 guidance. The beat versus consensus was primarily driven by better fuel costs in addition to non-fuel unit costs.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe worst performing airline stock for the week was Wizz Air, down 14.2%. According to Bank of America, all airlines have suspended flights to Israel. Wizz has the highest exposure at 6.1% capacity followed by easyJet at 2.7%. Wizz is by far the most exposed to Middle East travel, which accounts for 20.5% of its scheduled 2023 flights. Wizz has already reduced its F2H24 capacity growth guidance from 30% to 20%.\n\nAccording to Bank of America, COSCO\u2019s profit alert showed third quarter 2023 profits continuing to a quarter-over-quarter decline and sees downside into the fourth quarter. The bank lifted its 2023 estimates on a slower-than-expected spot rate decline in the third quarter with transpacific benefiting from some temporary supply-side discipline, but it leaves its 2024-2025 estimates unchanged with losses expected from building supply pressure.\n\nAccording to Goldman, Volaris announced an update to its 2023 guidance to reflect higher-than-expected jet fuel prices and aircraft groundings following Pratt & Whitney engines inspections. In summary, the company reduced its EBITDAR margin guidance to 26%, in line with Goldman, from 29-31% prior for 2023 fiscal year.\n\nOpportunities\n\nAccording to Raymond James, for SAS a consortium made up of AF-KLM, Castlelake, and Lind, together with the Danish State, would invest $1.175 billion ($475M common shares and $700M secured convertible bonds). AF-KLM\u2019s investment would represent a maximum 19.9% non-controlling stake. However, after a minimum of two years it may be increased to become a controlling shareholder.\n\nAccording to Stifel, for 2024 there should be modest shipping demand growth from higher iron ore mining production and coking coal. Thermal coal demand is likely to be a function of natural gas prices. High natural gas prices (greater than $12/MMBtu) should result in growth in thermal coal. For minor bulks, which make up just under 40% of all dry bulk trade, Stifel expects growth to be slightly higher than global GDP levels. With respect to supply, just 3% of the existing fleet is scheduled for delivery next year. Even with relatively healthy dry bulk shipping rates, the scrapping should take 1-2% out of the current fleet, leaving net fleet growth of 1%-2% at most.\n\nAccording to Goldman, for Boeing, new aircraft order demand remains quite strong driven by both growth and replacement; and Boeing and Airbus backlogs are large relative to the current delivery pace, creating tight supply versus demand. In addition, short-term MAX deliveries have been light compared to the planned medium-term production rate ramp-up, as supply chain issues continue to hold output back. However, Goldman expects higher deliveries into year-end and further acceleration in 2024, given seasonality and supply chain improvement. 787 deliveries were strong.\n\nThreats\n\nAccording to JPMorgan, the most relevant impact for the airport sector is related to the increasing risk perception for airports, manifested as a higher cost of capital for them going forward.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, UPS and FedEx customers are negotiating discounts following several years of rate hikes. According to Reuters\u2019 industry data and interviews with seven industry professionals, UPS and FedEx customers have been able to \u201ceasily\u201d win discounts back with savings of 8-12% versus previous agreements. The discount levels appear to be like pre-pandemic levels and could offset FDX and UPS\u2019s recent 5.9% GRI which was already below prior year increases. This could prove challenging to FDX\u2019s ongoing cost cutting initiatives and UPS plans to offset labor cost inflation.\n\nFrench authorities asked airlines to cut 40% of flights at Paris-Orly airport at the end of last week ahead of unions\u2019 planned strike calling for pay increases. The country\u2019s civil aviation authority also asked the regional Marseille-Provence and Beauvais airports to reduce flights by 20% and 15%, respectively. The strike is set to come three days before a scheduled government-union meeting on low wages.\n\nLuxury Goods and International Markets\n\nStrengths\n\nShares of JPMorgan, the largest bank in the United States, gained on Friday after posing another quarter of record net interest income and boosting its forecast for the year. The bank reported a net interest income of $22.9 billion through September 30, above analyst expectations. The purchase of the First Republic Bank back in August and rising rates are benefiting the bank\u2019s performance.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, Porsche Cars North America, Inc. achieved a remarkable 21% increase in U.S. retail deliveries, totaling 19,988 cars, contributing to a 15% year-to-date growth with 56,323 new vehicles sold in the first nine months. The Macan emerged as the top-selling model, boasting a 31% year-to-date increase, with the new Cayenne following at 2%. Additionally, Porsche\u2019s used U.S. sales in the first nine months of 2023 surged by 20.2% year-on-year.\n\nWilliams Sonoma was the best performing S&P Global Luxury stock, gaining 3.9% in the past five days. Loop Capital revised its price target from $185 to $200. The company has outperformed the competition year-to-date, and the broker believes that its profitability levels are sustainable for several reasons, including the elimination of site-wide promotion, the continued shift to e-commerce, and the company\u2019s growing business-to-business operations.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nShares of LVMH, the parent company of Louis Vuitton and Dior, declined sharply after the company reported third-quarter group sales below expectations. Quarterly sales increased by 9% versus the 11% expected. The highly important Fashion & Leather Goods division delivered 9% sales versus 10% expected. The Wine and Spirit division was the weakest, where sales declined by 14% versus the same period of the prior year.\n\nInflation in the United States is coming down, but this week it was reported above expectations for the month of September. The month-over-month inflation was posted at 0.4%, above the expected 0.3%. The year-over-year inflation was posted at 3.7%, above the expected 3.6%.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings was the worst performing S&P Global Luxury stock, losing 11.1% in the past five days. This week, cruise operators and airlines fell as spiking oil prices due to growing conflict in the Middle East pressured these sectors.\n\nOpportunities\n\nDespite brokers revising luxury stocks lower, the long-term sector performance should remain solid. After this week\u2019s correction, shares of Louis Vuitton, a global luxury conglomerate, are in oversold territory. In the past five years, the current level was only observed a few times, and it was followed by a recovery.\n\nBMW launched the all-new X2 generation. In its first version, the BMW X2 set the standard for premium small SUVs with a sporty touch. Now, in its second generation, it\u2019s pushing the envelope even further with a bold new design that resembles the larger BMW X4. The new X2 is larger, sleeker, more aerodynamic, and comes with additional features. Plus, there\u2019s a brand-new, all-electric model called the BMW iX2. This is a big upgrade from the original model.\n\nPolicymakers in China may issue a 1 trillion yuan ($137 billion) of additional sovereign debt to boost growth and meet economic targets. This could raise this year\u2019s budget deficit to well above the 3% cap set in March. The country\u2019s economic slowdown has weighed on everything from Chinese stocks to commodity prices and the results of multinational companies such as Nike Inc. and LVMH. And, if China provided more stimulus, it may boost consumer spending, leading to stronger luxury goods performance.\n\nThreats\n\nThe weaker-than-expected sales posted by Louis Vuitton this week sent a warning sign to luxury investors. Many brokers have revised luxury stock ratings, pointing to trouble lying ahead due to slower economic global growth, rising rates, and depletion of pandemic savings. The luxury sector holds long-term potential, but analysts remain cautious about the short term.\n\nTensions are high as Israel-Hamas fighting continues. Israel\u2019s military warned on Friday of today\u2019s \u201cday of rage\u201d announced by Hamas and urged its citizens abroad to avoid Palestinian protests around the globe. Israel\u2019s military has ordered the evacuation of 1 million Palestinians from northern Gaza to the south as the region awaits the imminent wide-scale ground invasion, according to FactSet.\n\nOn Thursday, the Prime Minister of Malaysia announced a new tax to be added on luxury goods next year as part of economic reform. The government plans to introduce a 5-10% tax on luxury goods such as jewelry and watches. Along with other measures planned by the government, it will help to lower Malaysia\u2019s fiscal deficit to 4.3% of the gross domestic product next year, from an estimated 5% this year.\n\nEnergy and Natural Resources\n\nStrengths\n\nThe best performing commodity for the week was coffee, rising 6.06%, its first weekly gain in a month, as noted by Bloomberg. The price spike was attributed to short covering. Crude prices, which were falling earlier in the week, surged over 5% on Friday as Israel warned the people of Gaza to flee to the south as the markets realized we were much closer to an invasion by Israeli ground forces into the region. This significantly raises the level of risks for a wider conflict.\n\nChinese coal prices are approaching six-month highs heading into the winter heating season, suggesting that the authorities will re-double efforts to ensure supply after the country largely escaped severe power outages over the summer. Thermal coal at the port of Qinhuangdao is being offered at more than 1,000 yuan a ton, according to Fengkuang Coal Logistics, a level last seen in April when optimism over China\u2019s recovery from the pandemic was relatively intact.\n\nAccording to Goldman, differently from oil, the ongoing conflict in Israel has started to impact natural gas supply. With Israel asking Chevron to halt operations at the 10 Bcm/y Tamar field for safety reasons, the bank sees this as a potential tightening of equal size to global LNG markets.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe worst performing commodity for the week was lead, dropping 5.09%, as sentiment weakened across the board for base metals. According to UBS, we are in the midst of a refining pullback. In the last three weeks refining equities are down 11.2%, underperforming broader Energy by 700 basis points (bps) and S&P by 1,096bps. Refining equities have never gone up linearly and pullbacks are common in this sector. This is the second major pullback in 2023. The first pullback started late March and the current pullback has been triggered by a sharp correction in gasoline crack.\n\nIron ore sank to its lowest in a month after falling 4% during China\u2019s Golden Week holiday, with stagnant home sales weighing on demand. Prices of the steelmaking material fell as much as 2.2% Monday in thin trading. Analysts are expecting a cautious recovery rather than an outright rebound in the property sector, which accounts for nearly 40% of steel consumption.\n\nIt is up to Codelco\u2019s board and management to turn around the state behemoth\u2019s ailing copper mines and projects using currently available resources, according to a senior government official. When asked if Chile\u2019s government would throw Codelco a lifeline as it grapples with slumping output and profit and rising debt, Mining Minister Aurora Williams said the public company must operate as if it were a private-sector enterprise. \u201cIt is the administration, through its chairman, its CEO, who must seek to resolve the various problems \u2014 whether financial or operational,\u201d Williams said in an interview from Bloomberg\u2019s London office on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nOpportunities\n\nBank of America anticipates some focus will turn back to the US SPR, which still has ample capacity to release production given 351 mm bbls still in storage. Despite criticism over prior price-related releases under the current administration, its actual purpose is to be available in response to geopolitical risk to supply. The SPR has shown itself capable of adding 1mm bpd rate for 90 days, although this may be premature given any perceived benefit to limit domestic price inflation would be 13 months before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. In any other circumstance the bank doubts Saudi would look favorably on such a move.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden is set to announce as much as $7 billion in funding for hydrogen projects across the country as part of a competition to jump-start production of the clean-burning fuel in the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to Goldman, ExxonMobil announced the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources in an all-stock transaction valued at $59.5 billion, with an enterprise value of $64.5 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2024 pending customary closing conditions. The companies expect the transaction to be accretive on earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow in 2024.\n\nThreats\n\nAccording to Goldman, the Wall Street Journal reported that \u201cSaudi Arabia has told the White House it would be willing to boost oil production early next year if crude prices are high\u2014a move aimed at winning goodwill in Congress for a deal in which the kingdom would recognize Israel and in return get a defense pact with Washington, Saudi and U.S. officials said.\u201d In Goldman\u2019s view, the escalating conflict in Gaza reduces the likelihood of a near-term normalization in Saudi Israeli relations.\n\nOil cuts by Saudi Arabia, which pumps a lot of the heavier crudes that are used to make diesel fuel, have refiners struggling to find enough of this feedstock to supply the fuel that is the lifeblood of the global economy. Wood Mackenzie Ltd. sees global refinery production dropping 1.5% this quarter, which translates to 1.2 million barrels per day in reduced supply. Unless a recession reduces demand, shortages of diesel and home heating oil could push up inflation this winter.\n\nA probe into a leak from an undersea gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia is proceeding on the assumption that it was a deliberate act of destruction,\n\naccording to people familiar with the matter. There are no final conclusions, the people said. Officials are expected to give more details on the investigation later. European gas prices rose as much as 10%.\n\nBitcoin and Digital Assets\n\nStrengths\n\nOf the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the best performer for the week was Loom Network, rising 62.4%.\n\nThe surge in government bond yields over the past few weeks saw Bitcoin beating equities by a wide margin. Should yields resume their advance, that could ultimately end up benefiting the largest digital token, writes Bloomberg.\n\nStablecoin issuer Tether Holdings appointed its technology boss Paolo Ardoino as its new chief executive officer, following several years in which the executive had emerged as the company\u2019s main public figure, writes Bloomberg.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOf the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the worst performer for the week was Mantle, down 18.22%.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fell back on Thursday, extending declines for a sixth day despite widespread advances seen in other risk-sensitive assets, with gains form a recent bullish trend fizzling out as cryptos returned to familiar trading ranges, writes Bloomberg.\n\nHamas\u2019 lightning strike on Israel last weekend has left observers questioning how the group financed the surprise operation. One possible answer: cryptocurrency. Hamas received large amounts of funds through crypto, according to a review of Israeli government seizure orders and blockchain analytics reports, writes Bloomberg.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe owner of crypto exchange Bitfinex is exploring a $150 million share buyback that would provide it with greater control over the private company\u2019s dealings, according to Bloomberg.\n\nDecentralized finance is yet to pose a meaningful risk to overall financial stability, explains Bloomberg, but does require monitoring, according to the European Union\u2019s financial markets and securities regulator.\n\nMastercard, in conjunction with the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre, revealed on Thursday the latest results of their CBD pilot project, writes BlockWorks. Notably, the pilot included a live transaction where an NFT was purchased on the Ethereum blockchain using a \u201cwrapped\u201d version of the CBDC.\n\nThreats\n\nCaroline Ellison took the witness stand Tuesday afternoon and within minutes pointed to her former boss and boyfriend, FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, as the man responsible for the loss of billions in customer funds. \u201cHe directed me to commit these crimes,\u201d she told jurors, according to Bloomberg reports.\n\nIn the latest blow to Binance\u2019s global ambitions, a Brazilian congressional committee has recommended the indictment of four of the company\u2019s senior leaders including its founder and CEO CZ, writes Bloomberg.\n\nCaroline Ellison, on Wednesday, detailed how she worked with Sam Bankman-Fried to lie about the health of Alameda Research and FTX and deceive lenders and customers. She testified that she falsified Alameda\u2019s balance sheet, at the direction of Bankman-Fried, to conceal that the firm was taking in large sums of money from FTX customers, writes Bloomberg.\n\nGold Market\n\nThis week gold futures closed at $1,941.50, up $96.30 per ounce, or 5.22%. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week higher by 7.49%. The S&P/TSX Venture Index came in off 0.83%. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar rose 0.55%.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe best performing precious metal for the week was gold, up 5.22%. Gold in China jumped to trade at the second-highest premium on record against the international benchmark, as mainland markets reopened following the Golden Week holiday. The Shanghai spot price was more than $112 an ounce higher\n\nthan levels seen in London on Monday, according to Bloomberg calculations and based on exchange data. The gap between the two markets has only been wider one other time, when Chinese prices last month blew out to trade at a premium of more than $120 over London, as Beijing restricted shipments in a move that squeezed the market.\n\nthan levels seen in London on Monday, according to Bloomberg calculations and based on exchange data. The gap between the two markets has only been wider one other time, when Chinese prices last month blew out to trade at a premium of more than $120 over London, as Beijing restricted shipments in a move that squeezed the market. Calibre Mining Corp. reported Tuesday record gold production of\n\n73,485 ounces in the third quarter, a 50% year-on-year increase. The company said this marked the fourth consecutive quarter that it achieved record quarterly gold production. Year-to-date production increased 30% to 160,704 ounces as the company remains on track to deliver its full-year 2023 guidance of 250,000 to 275,000 ounces.\n\n73,485 ounces in the third quarter, a 50% year-on-year increase.

Gold surged above $1,900 on Friday as conflict in the Middle East appeared to be headed for escalation this weekend. The precious metal steadied after jumping 1.6% on Monday, the most since May, as haven demand rose on the back of Hamas\u2019 shock attack on Israel over the weekend. However, the developments on Friday sent gold climbing over 3% on the day.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe worst performing precious metal for the week was palladium, down 1.30%. According to JPMorgan, platinum and palladium prices slumped to a year-to-date low earlier this week as continued higher-for-longer interest rate pricing finally cracked resilience in precious metals prices over the last few weeks. More broadly, platinum deficits have not been felt in the broader physical market as China has likely destocked domestic above-ground inventory imported over recent years. Power disruptions in South Africa have also not materially disrupted supply, eroding a risk premium that was embedded in prices earlier this year.\n\nFor K92 Mining, as a result of the unexpectedly challenging first quarter and the impacts of the safety incident on June 28, 2023, the company is updating its production guidance to 111,000 from 116,000 ounces gold (originally 120,000 to 140,000 ounces). Given K92\u2019s strong liquidity position for the Stage 3 and 4 Expansions and the positive reported exploration results to date, it is increasing exploration expenditures for 2023 to $20 million from $13 to $16 million originally planned.\n\nThe CPI print on Thursday morning took what was looking to be a good rally in the price of gold to start the day to a deflating loss. The data supports the thesis for another rate hike this year but it\u2019s not certain. However, investors versus the pundits calling for a cut in rates may set the path forward with higher long rates continuing to increase. As Bloomberg noted, price agnostic buyers, U.S. commercial banks, hedge funds, insurers, and pensions, are move aggressive and likely to demand higher yields to finance long-term government debt.\n\nOpportunities\n\nCould this be the start of a new bull market in bullion? No one knows the answer to that question, but looking at some of the initial stock price performance for some of the best performing senior peers for the week shows promise: Harmony Gold Mining up 27%, Gold Fields Ltd. up 26% and AngloGold Ashanti Plc. up 22%. While this is intriguing performance, it doesn\u2019t translate to gains per say, unless investors already owned the companies in a portfolio. That is where the opportunity lies; gold stocks have been ignored relative to the price of gold with the digital asset frenzy of recent years. Gold stocks, in particular the junior gold exploration and development tiers, have been eschewed by new investors in search of quick riches.\n\nBank of America thinks that the royalty & streaming (R&S) names are the preferred picks in this type of environment given fortress balance sheets, low costs that are insulated from cost inflation, and lower gold price operating leverage. The bank highlights R&S companies Franco-Nevada and Wheaton Precious Metals given their large market caps, deep liquidity, and substantial asset and commodity diversification.\n\nAccording to Bank of America, as to gold, Heraeus outlines that \u201cDespite net negative demand in April and May this year, strong buying activity by central banking institutions has returned.\u201d There were no notable sales in August, while purchases totaled 77 tons. The Chinese central bank added 29 tons to its gold reserves in August, continuing a streak of buying that began in November last year. Central bank purchases have supported gold.\n\nThreats\n\nAccording to BMO, Dundee Precious Metals reported its third quarter 2023 production results with gold and copper production slightly lower than its estimate. Overall, gold production remains well on track to meet 2023 guidance, but copper production could achieve the lower end of guidance.\n\nAccording to CIBC, Karora Resources reported consolidated third quarter 2023 production results of 39.5koz, below consensus of 41.6koz. Third quarter production brought Q1-Q3 production to 120.2koz, tracking in line with the high end of unchanged 2023 guidance of 145koz-160koz.\n\nAn unsolved $17 million heist of Swiss gold and cash near Canada\u2019s busiest airport has led Brink\u2019s Co. to sue Air Canada for allegedly letting a thief slip away with the loot. Miami-based Brink\u2019s accused the airline of \u201cnegligence and carelessness\u201d in a lawsuit after a heist at a Toronto cargo facility netted thieves about 400 kilograms (882 pounds) of gold and $1.9 million in bank notes.\n\nU.S. Global Investors, Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) failed to hit $100,000 during the 2021 bull market because defunct exchange FTX kept selling BTC, analysis claims.\n\nIn an X (formerly Twitter) post on Oct. 12, Joe Burnett, senior product marketing manager at Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, joined voices arguing that FTX executives suppressed BTC price strength.\n\nFTX testimony reveals mass BTC selling\n\nAs the trial of former FTX CEO Sam \u201cSBF\u201d Bankman-Fried continues, new testimony paints a picture of potential market manipulation.\n\nThis week, Caroline Ellison, former CEO of affiliated firm Alameda Research, reportedly told the court that Bankman-Fried asked her to sell BTC should its spot price breach $20,000. This was done using FTX customer funds, which neither had the right to deploy.\n\nAUSA: What are these?\n\nEllison: Notes from a conversation with Sam. I wrote, keep selling BTC if its over $20K.\n\nAUSA: You wrote, FTX may raise. What does that mean?\n\nEllison: Raise capital by selling equity, to get more money. To investors like MSB, the Saudi Prince \u2014 Inner City Press (@innercitypress) October 11, 2023\n\nReacting, Burnett suggested that due to the scale of the operations involved, the entire Bitcoin bull run could have been adversely affected.\n\n\u201cAlameda was insolvent even during the bull market. It appears they used (or \u2018borrowed\u2019) FTX customer bitcoin and other customer assets to buy \u2018Sam coins\u2019 (FTT, Solana, and Serum),\u201d he wrote, referring to reports that Ellison\u2019s firm had a negative value of $2.7 billion in 2021.\n\n\u201cWithout this fake sell pressure, maybe bitcoin would have hit $100,000 in 2021.\u201d\n\nSBF vs. S2F\n\nDuring the bull run of 2021, BTC/USD still reached an all-time high of $69,000; but at the time, predictions called for much larger numbers.\n\nRelated: Sam Bankman-Fried blamed Binance for balance sheet leak to media: Court evidence\n\nAmong those was the then-popular Stock-to-Flow (S2F) Bitcoin price model, the creator of which \u2014 the pseudonymous entity known as PlanB \u2014 gave a BTC price target of up to $288,000 during the current halving cycle.\n\nThe \u201cworst case scenario,\u201d he continued, was $135,000 by December 2021.\n\nBitcoin is below $34K, triggered by Elon Musk's energy FUD and China's mining crack down.\n\n\n\nThere is also a more fundamental reason that we see weakness in June, and possibly July.

        "content": "SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the digital asset space with a belief the price of assets such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) will go up.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Scaramucci fought back against Bitcoin bears like Warren Buffett.\n\nWhat Happened: Legendary investor Buffett is best known as the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B), a conglomerate that owns many companies and invests in multiple public companies.\n\nFor those in the cryptocurrency space, Buffett is familiar as one of the biggest bears of Bitcoin, an asset he once famously called \u201crat poison squared.\u201d\n\nScaramucci said the bear case by Buffett and others is that Bitcoin is just a cryptograph on the internet, worth nothing, shouldn\u2019t have value and should be banned.\n\n\u201cThey really don\u2019t understand the concept and the whole history of money,\u201d Scaramucci said on a recent episode of \u201cThe Raz Report.\u201d\n\nScaramucci said paper money is worthless by definition but we ascribe a value to it. Digital in a bank account are worth something and can be sent in wire transfers to pay for items.\n\nThe SkyBridge Capital founder said the world has always had a ledger and put value on items giving them monetary value.\n\n\u201cIf you think about it that way, Bitcoin is a fairly perfect ledger.\u201d\n\nScaramucci said Bitcoin is transparent and fully decentralized.\n\nThe 14-year-old history of Bitcoin and increased use of people using it as a payment and the efficiency improvements by the lightning network are also eliminating the thesis from the Bitcoin bears.\n\nScaramucci added the trust and integrity of Bitcoin make it valuable.\n\nRelated Link: Exclusive: Yusko Calls Out Warren Buffett, The Reason Warren Wants To P*** On Bitcoin Is...\n\nWhat\u2019s Next: In the interview, Scaramucci shared he believes the pending launch of Bitcoin ETFs could serve as a catalyst to take the price of Bitcoin higher in 2024.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m right, we could be sitting at $150k, $250k Bitcoin,\u201d Scaramucci said.\n\nScaramucci praised the \u201cfinite supply\u201d of Bitcoin and also considered it a potential hedge against the future devaluing of the U.S. dollar.\n\nWhile Buffett may be critical of Bitcoin and its future, one of his portfolio holdings is betting on the continued growth of digital banking and making it easier for customers in Latin America to trade cryptocurrency.\n\nAs previously shared by Benzinga, Buffett is a holder of stock in Nu Holdings Ltd (NYSE: NU), which gives him exposure to an asset he absolutely despises.\n\nRead Next: Exclusive: Mark Yusko On Bitcoin's Future, 2024 Price Target\n\nMeet and engage with transformative Digital Asset and Crypto business leaders and investors at Benzinga's exclusive event: Future of Digital Assets.

        "title": "Uptober may be over: Bitcoin price data shows investor sentiment at 3-month low - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) faced a 4.9% correction in the four days following its failure to break the $28,000 resistance on Oct. 8, and derivatives metrics show fear is dominating sentiment in the market \u2014 but will it be enough to shake Bitcoin price from its current range?\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, Bitcoin is holding up admirably, especially when compared with gold, which has fallen by 5% since June, and Treasury Inflation-Protected (TIP) bonds, which have seen a 4.2% drop during the same period. Merely maintaining its position at $27,700, Bitcoin has outperformed two of the most secure assets in traditional finance.\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s price rejection at $28,000 on Oct. 8, investors should analyze BTC derivatives metrics to determine whether bears are indeed in control.\n\nBitcoin/USD vs. inflation-protected TIP ETF vs. gold. Source: TradingView\n\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities are U.S. government bonds designed to safeguard against inflation. Consequently, the value of TIP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tends to rise with increasing inflation since the bond principal and interest payments adjust to inflation, preserving the purchasing power for investors.\n\n$27,600 Bitcoin is not necessarily a bad thing\n\nRegardless of how you frame this historic achievement, Bitcoin enthusiasts may not be entirely satisfied with its current $520 billion market capitalization, even though it surpasses the market caps of global payment processor Visa ($493 billion) and Exxon Mobil ($428 billion). This bullish expectation is partly based on Bitcoin\u2019s previous all-time high market cap of $1.3 trillion in November 2021.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies \u2014 including the euro, Swiss franc and British pound \u2014 is nearing its highest level in 10 months. This indicates a strong vote of confidence in the resilience of the U.S. economy, at least in relative terms. This alone should be enough to justify reduced interest in alternative hedge instruments like Bitcoin.\n\nSome may argue that the 3% gains in the S&P 500 index since June contradict the idea of investors seeking cash positions. However, the top 25 companies hold a combined $4.2 trillion in cash and equivalents, in addition to being highly profitable. This explains why stocks are also being used as a hedge rather than a risk-seeking venture.\n\nIn essence, there is no reason for Bitcoin investors to be dissatisfied with its recent performance. However, this sentiment changes when we analyze BTC derivatives metrics.\n\nBitcoin derivatives show declining demand from bulls\n\nTo begin with, Bitcoin\u2019s futures contract premium, also known as the basis rate, reached its lowest level in four months. Normally, Bitcoin monthly futures trade at a slight premium compared to spot markets, indicating that sellers demand additional money to postpone settlement. As a result, futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at an annualized premium of 5% to 10%, a situation not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin two-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe current 3.2% futures premium (basis rate) is at its lowest point since mid-June, before BlackRock filed for a spot ETF. This metric indicates a reduced appetite for leverage buyers, although it doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect bearish expectations.\n\nTo determine whether the rejection at $28,000 on Oct. 8 has led to decreased optimism among investors, traders should examine Bitcoin options markets. The 25% delta skew is a telling indicator, especially when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nRelated: Did SBF really use FTX traders\u2019 Bitcoin to keep BTC price under $20K?\n\nIf traders anticipate a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and periods of excitement tend to have a -7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs shown above, the Bitcoin options\u2019 25% delta skew switched to \u201cfear\u201d mode on Oct. 10, with protective put (sell) options currently trading at a 13% premium compared to similar call (buy) options.\n\nBitcoin derivatives metrics suggest that traders are becoming less confident, which can be partly attributed to the multiple postponements of the spot Bitcoin ETF decisions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and concerns regarding exchanges\u2019 exposure to terrorist organizations.\n\nFor now, the negative sentiment toward cryptocurrencies seems to invalidate any benefits arising from macroeconomic uncertainty and the natural hedge protection provided by Bitcoin\u2019s predictable monetary policy. At least from a derivatives perspective, the likelihood of Bitcoin\u2019s price breaking above $28,000 in the short term appears slim.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "Things seem to have taken a turn lower in the crypto market, but bitcoin offers a glimmer of hope and Wolfe Research is defending its long view of the asset. The crypto market continues to struggle from low volume and liquidity that have dragged on for most of the year. It has traded in a narrow range between $25,000 and $30,000 all year, which many had seen as encouraging, demonstrating that although investors weren't building positions, they weren't exiting either. \"That changed this week with Monday seeing over $105 million in crypto liquidations, and the equal weight crypto index we track breaking down in turn,\" Wolfe Research's Rob Ginsberg said in a note Wednesday. \"We have repeatedly touched on how uninspiring the price action has been outside of bitcoin, and it appears the cracks are finally starting to show.\" \"While the resiliency of Bitcoin continues to be the one silver lining, it's growing increasingly clear just how alone it stands,\" he added. \"[It's] rolling over again in the near term, but our thesis on bitcoin is simple: [as] long as $25,000 support is holding, we'll remain long.\" It takes a patient investor, however. Although bitcoin is up about 61% this year, it's off its all-time high by as much. Not only has it been unable to break out to new highs above $30,000 this year after hitting it for the first time this year as early as April, but it has also underperformed equities for the better part of two years. On top of that, Treasury yields remain high amid stubbornly high inflation and uncertainty around the Israel-Hamas war. \"Higher yields have historically proven to be a headwind to crypto and growth alike,\" Ginsberg said. \"Having failed to take advantage of this pullback thus far, if yields reaccelerate like we think, it should throw some added pressure on BTC.\" Crypto stocks are also trading down, but may be finding support now, according to Wolfe. \"If these bases are for real \u2026 which we believe they are, a next leg higher will have to come soon,\" Ginsberg said. He also highlighted the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF , which is back to its February highs and up about 90% this year. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market staged a solid rebound this year after a disappointing 2022 as the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary tightening campaign, which saw aggressive interest rate hikes to combat multi-decade high inflation, weighed on cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB), have been rangebound over the past three months as investors are yet to get a clear picture about the Fed\u2019s future course of action with its interest rate hikes.\n\nBitcoin particularly had been on a rally till July, with its price hitting $31,500. However, the Fed has since hiked interest rates once in July, following which cryptocurrencies took a hit once again. In fact, Bitcoin has been falling since hitting its 52-week high in early July.\n\nHowever, it has also solidified its position over the past few weeks and is now hovering around $26,900 after falling as much as $25,400 in late August and September.\n\nThe rebound has been taking place since the Fed kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged in its September FOMC meeting to its current range of 5.25-5.25%.\n\nA higher market interest rate has a negative impact on high-growth sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrencies. The Fed\u2019s aggressive monetary tightening policy has also raised worries that the economy might slip into a recession.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, in his first post-FOMC comment, said that inflation remains elevated, which might require the central bank to hike interest rates by another 25 basis points before it starts cutting interest rates in 2024.\n\nFollowing Powell\u2019s hawkish comments, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note surged to its highest level since 2007. The 10-year Treasury yield holds immense significance as it mirrors market participants' outlook on the nation's economic situation, influencing consumers, businesses and government entities.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, cryptocurrencies are once again trying to rebound from their recent lows as investors\u2019 sentiments have been upbeat following dovish comments from a number of Fed officials. These officials believe that the recent tightening of credit conditions may make the central bank decide not to go for another interest rate hike in its November FOMC meeting.\n\nOur Choices\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAfter 45 days, the Securities and Exchange Commission has mere hours remaining before a recent court decision in favor of Grayscale becomes final at midnight. So far, the SEC hasn\u2019t said a word about it.\n\nOn August 29, a federal court ruled that the SEC was being \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in rejecting Grayscale\u2019s bid to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF, while approving similar futures Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOn Friday, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balcunas predicted that the SEC won\u2019t appeal the decision\u2014though he pointed out there\u2019s still time. He didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNada. Which means no appeal. Day not over yet tho. \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 13, 2023\n\nThe application to convert the GBTC to a spot Bitcoin ETF won\u2019t automatically be approved if the SEC takes no action before midnight. Instead, the court will likely follow up with a mandate regarding how to respond to its ruling. For the SEC, that could mean revisiting the application and finding different justifications for its denial or simply approving Grayscale\u2019s application.\n\nAs the deadline approached, GBTC shares were changing hands at $20.24, up a modest 1% in the past 24 hours. Approximately 2.2 million shares have moved in the past 24 hours\u2014which is nothing compared to the almost 20 million shares that were traded the same day a judge handed Grayscale its court victory.\n\nWhen markets closed on October 12, Grayscale held $24.00 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) per GBTC share, according to the firm\u2019s website. On Friday, GBTC shares traded for $20.24 apiece, indicating a share discount of roughly 15%.\n\nThe discount is the difference between the total market value of all outstanding GBTC shares, and the net asset value of all Bitcoin held by Grayscale.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs a spot Bitcoin ETF, shares of GBTC would be directly redeemable for the BTC held by Grayscale. Therefore, approving its conversion would immediately bring Grayscale\u2019s share value up to parity with the value of its Bitcoin, creating a significant windfall for investors.\n\nThe SEC has for years rejected every spot Bitcoin ETF application to arrive on its doorstep. As doubts about Grayscale\u2019s odds of successful conversion took hold, its share discount drifted as low as 48% in December 2022.\n\nThe GBTC discount narrowed after investment giant Blackrock filed to list an equivalent product in June, given the asset manager\u2019s near-perfect success streak with the SEC. It shrank again after Grayscale\u2019s SEC lawsuit proved successful.\n\nThe SEC also lost on most fronts in its lawsuit against Ripple, after Judge Analisa Torres ruled in July that XRP transactions on crypto exchanges are not securities transactions. Last week, the judge rejected the agency\u2019s attempt at appeal.\n\nGrayscale is also attempting to convert its Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF after the SEC approved the first futures Ethereum ETFs earlier this month."

        "content": "\u201cContrary to popular belief, Bitcoin did not appear out of nothing. For decades prior to Satoshi Nakamoto introducing his invention, a diverse group of computer scientists, privacy activists, and heterodox economists tried to create a digital form of money that could operate independently of government control. The Genesis Book tells the story of the people and projects that inspired the invention of the world's first successful peer-to-peer electronic cash system.\u201d\n\n-Cover Sypnosis\n\nAaron van Wirdum\u2019s long awaited book goes through the pre-history of everything that led up to the creation of Bitcoin. So many individual ideas and concepts went into the creation of Bitcoin that people tend to forget the history of those pieces before Satoshi glued them together into the Bitcoin protocol we know today.\n\nThe Genesis Book gives the readers a long walk through the history of both the people and cultural movements spawned out of the early rise of the hacker community, and how these cultural movements and their respective ethoses shaped the technologies themselves that were produced. The ethos and mentality of the members of early counter-culture groups like the cypherpunks and extropians laid the ideological foundation of the cultures we see thriving in Bitcoin today.\n\nThese same people also laid the technical foundations Bitcoin itself was built upon, through early attempts at digital cash systems like David Chaum\u2019s ecash, to Wei Dai\u2019s b-money. Concepts like Adam Back\u2019s Hashcash and Hal Finney\u2019s Reusable Proof of Work (RPOW) also began the slow road towards Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work consensus system.\n\nFor anyone who wants to truly understand the pre-history of Bitcoin, and the people and technological inventions that laid the groundwork for Satoshi\u2019s gift to us, this book is a must read.\n\n\n\nThe book is available for pre-order here, with shipments expected to go out starting on January 3rd, 2024."

        "content": "A new report from Glassnode, an on-chain analytical firm, has buttressed recent data indicating Bitcoin holders are adding to their holdings. These long-term Bitcoin investors, often known as \u201cHODLers,\u201d don\u2019t appear to be phased by the recent volatility in Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nAccording to on-chain data, long-term holders have been rapidly amassing Bitcoin, adding more than 50,000 BTC each month to their holdings.\n\nMonthly Accumulation Of BTC Worth $1.35 Billion\n\nBitcoin is currently showing signs of slowing down, as its price just dipped below $27,000. It would appear that short-term speculators are mostly to blame for the persistent selling pressure, as data shows whale investors are seeing this opportunity to buy more BTC at a discount rather than secure profits.\n\nAccording to Glassnode\u2019s HODLer Net Position Change metric, long-term holders are purchasing an average of 50,000 BTC worth $1.35 billion at the current price of Bitcoin every month.\n\nAnother metric, the Long-Term Holder Supply, which measures the amount of BTC\u2019s market cap with holders, also reached an all-time high of 14.859 million BTC. This means 76.1% of the total circulating supply has not moved in the past five months. Consequently, 94.8% of the total Bitcoin supply has not moved in the past month.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nTo back up this data of increased accumulation, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared chart data from Santiment showing Bitcoin whales have purchased around 20,000 BTC since the beginning of October, worth roughly $550 million.\n\nAt this rate, the number of BTC vaulted by holders is poised to pass 50,000 in October. This increased accumulation suggests that long-term holders remain confident in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term potential and see this price correction as temporary.\n\n#Bitcoin whales have purchased around 20,000 $BTC since the beginning of October, worth roughly $550 million! pic.twitter.com/47ZePiaIII \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 10, 2023\n\nBTC price falls below $27,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com\n\nBitcoin Supply Tightens\n\nAccording to Glassnode, only 11.5% of BTC\u2019s circulating supply changed hands in the last 3 months, indicating a prolonged inactive period of on-chain activity. That there are fewer transactions suggests that investors are unwilling to sell at the current price as the industry awaits approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nSource: Glassnode\n\nIf this current trend holds, then the current downtrend could be short-lived, especially if sentiment among smaller traders also turns toward buying. A predominantly hold mentality would give the asset time to recover and establish significant support that serves as a bounce-off point for another rally.\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at $26,766 and is down by 1.31% in a 24-hour timeframe as it approaches the next major support near the $26,500 level. If enough large players accumulate at these lower prices, it may establish a price floor as bulls push the price back up.\n\nAs crypto analyst James Straten points out, Bitcoin could jump 50% as part of the correlation between the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the price of BTC.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to say bitcoin is good or bad,\u201d he says. \u201cBitcoin isn\u2019t a threat to gold because it does different things. If you have gold in your portfolio, somewhere between 5 and 10 per cent, it increases your risk-adjusted returns, protects against shocks, negates market falls, and is a genuine diversifier.\n\n\u201cIf you had bitcoin in your portfolio over the last five years it has done very well, but it hasn\u2019t been a diversifier. What it\u2019s done is add massively to your risk, especially equity risk, so it\u2019s like doubling up on tech stocks, or buying the Nasdaq with leverage.\n\n\u201cThis was demonstrated perfectly when the Fed started to hike rates in 2022, tech stocks got clobbered and bitcoin got slapped. So, I don\u2019t see bitcoin as a competitor to gold.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was invented in 2009 to harness blockchain technology to buy goods and services via online transfers without the need for bank accounts.\n\nHowever, it quickly snowballed into a synthetic asset price bubble promoted by a mishmash of stakeholders who organised themselves over social media and the internet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis has helped it thump gold\u2019s returns over the past 14 years and its supporters believe its capped supply of 21 million coins mean it will continue to rise faster in value than gold.\n\nBut Yermack says these assumptions are based on historical price action, rather than any academic or mathematical fundamentals.\n\n\u201cWhether bitcoin proves a better investment than gold in the future is really anybody\u2019s guess,\u201d he says. \u201cNeither asset has any fundamental properties such as cash flows or property rights connected to it, so their values are based on pure speculation by investors.\u201d\n\nGolden knee-jerk\n\nOther US academics, including Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel, insist \u201cbitcoin is the new gold for Millennials\u201d, who view it as a superior hedge against central bank money printing and inflation that peaked at 7.8 per cent in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nThe view that bitcoin works as an inflation hedge is shared by Adrian Przelozny, the founder of crypto exchange Independent Reserve. He says bitcoin will create long-term value for investors due to its fixed supply, although its wild price swings mean it\u2019s unlikely to work as money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s volatility is a lot higher than gold, but it\u2019s reducing over time and will probably begin to act like a commodity in the next 10 or 15 years,\u201d says Przelozny. \u201cThere\u2019s also the halving in bitcoin supply around next May and we\u2019re optimistic that will support prices.\u201d\n\nHowever, gold strategist Read insists investors should understand that gold and bitcoin play different roles in potential wealth creation depending on an investor\u2019s objectives.\n\nThe strategist also advises against buying gold as a kneejerk reaction to headlines around geopolitical conflict such as in Israel.\n\n\u201cTypically, what happens during a geopolitical event is gold spikes and then over the following period when the world doesn\u2019t end it falls back,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe only people buying under shock events are those covering shorts [bets on the price falling] and nimble traders who want to profit from very short-term moves in gold. But in general, I say geopolitical conflict isn\u2019t a reason to buy gold, it\u2019s a demonstration of why gold should have been in your portfolio in the first place, as it protects against the unforeseen.\u201d\n\nReade adds he is confident gold\u2019s defensive qualities for conservative investors focused on the long term will shine through, as central banks cut interest rates within 24 months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe next big change in direction for interest rates will be a fall for a number of reasons,\u201d he says. \u201cThe US could pull off a soft landing with unemployment a bit higher and inflation coming down to see rates fall. Or the US could tip into recession and rates fall faster, or we get some sort of financial crisis, in which case rates will fall faster than anyone expects, that would be really good for gold.\u201d\n\nToday, the sum of all gold reserves equals $US12.3 trillion ($19.2 trillion), with the metal owned by investors for thousands of years due to its status as a store of value that can also be used for decorative purposes.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, has raced to a $US588 billion market value in just 14 years, since its invention as a form of decentralised money by pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is favoured by younger investors who brush off the risk of capital losses to embrace investments stoked by the two great 21st-century trends of the internet and social media.\n\nOlder investors \u2013 often managing larger amounts of capital \u2013 tend to prefer the security of gold as a physical safe-haven asset, which rarely crashes in value like bitcoin."

Bitcoin, XRP , Solana, Litecoin , and Dogecoin were trading in the red, while Ethereum, Cardano, Tron, Toncoin , and Polygon were trading in the green.Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap declined 0.24% to around $1.05 trillion in the last 24 hours.Bitcoin was down 0.8% at $26,897 as of 12:12 p.m., while Ethereum was just above the $1,550 level.\"Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced a consistent four-day decline, indicating a bearish trend in the market. From a technical perspective, it's notable that both crypto's are currently trading below the critical 50 and 200 EMA Daily, with BTC below Rs 23,97,000 ($27,000) and ETH below Rs 1,40,700 ($1,575),\" said CoinDCX Research Team.Meanwhile, ZebPay Trade Desk, said, \"The crypto market is currently facing pressure with Bitcoin and major altcoins experiencing a downturn. This decline is partially attributed to the release of the September Producer Price Index (PPI) report, which revealed a surge in wholesale inflation to 0.5%. This exceeded market expectations, indicating higher inflationary pressures.\"The total volume in DeFi is currently $1.88 billion, 7.55% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $23.5 billion, which is 94.41% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, declined to $524 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 49.87%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours rose 7.39% to $12.38 billion.\"Bitcoin is consolidating at $26,800 while altcoins bleed against it. At the same BTC price, Ethereum was trading at $1,800 in July but now it is trading at $1,560. This trend will likely continue through this month. BTC has to reclaim $27,400 in the upcoming days to negate its bearish momentum. Risks of increased oil prices and negative jobs outlook continue to dampen spirits in the crypto ecosystem,\" Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, said.On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin demonstrated its technical position at $26,780, with a critical point set at $27,000. Notable resistance levels include $27,300, $27,745, and up to $28,280. Conversely, immediate support lies at $26,414, with additional levels at $26,186 and $25,989. Investors and traders are closely monitoring Bitcoin's price action, particularly at the pivot point, to assess its future trajectory."

        "content": "\u201cIn her volleyball team, she was always trying to put the nets on the court when I was still practicing my shooting,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, you know, she\u2019d kick me off the court and we kind of started dating like that.\u201d\n\nDellavedova graduated with a psychology degree in 2013. In 2017, he married Anna in what he describes as a \u201cdestination wedding\u201d in Milwaukee.\n\nBertie\u2019s menu is scrawled in black felt tip on a large sheet of paper that hangs on giant paper clips next to the butcher\u2019s back door. There are three smoked meat mains to choose from, or a pulled lamb brioche with mint yoghurt.\n\nI order pulled pork and the 190 cm basketball professional chooses beef brisket, with two sides: organic vegetables and salad. He orders a second long black coffee. I ask for a Coke.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Jason replies. \u201cWe\u2019ve got organic cola, like a hipster cola if you want.\u201d Hipster cola it is, but maybe I should have stuck with Coke.\n\nHustle like Delly: Cavaliers guard Matthew Dellavedova goes horizontal to keep the ball inbounds against the Golden State Warriors. Frederic J. Brown\n\nAs we wait for the food and drinks, we talk basketball. Dellavedova played for Australia at the London 2012 Olympics, age 21, where the team lost in the quarter-finals to the USA. The following year, however, his dreams of a professional basketball contract were on the line in the NBA Draft, where the 30 NBA teams choose mainly college players, starting with the teams that finished lowest in the previous season.\n\nGetting selected can be life changing. But for Dellavedova, despite dominating in his college years, there would be no pick in the June 2013 draft. The feeling of rejection was tough to take, he says.\n\n\u201cSo, I had to work my way through Summer League and go to training camp and just back myself to make it. I had to fight for a spot.\u201d\n\nThe focus and determination paid off. By September, the Cleveland Cavaliers had offered the point guard a starting contract of close to $US500,000 a season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014, things got even more real when the Ohio team that had never won an NBA championship announced the return of superstar LeBron James from the Miami Heat, on an annual salary of more than $US21 million.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of when everything changed for the Cavs,\u201d he says.\n\nJames, who stands at 206cm and goes by the nickname \u201cKing James\u201d, soon galvanised his home-town team of Cleveland, and Dellavedova, to reach new heights.\n\nFrom left: LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Dellavedova. Carlos Osorio\n\n\u201cI remember the first time he came into training camp he got all the players into the video room and went through each player, their strengths, and what they can bring to the team to help us win a championship, and I was just kind of surprised. I was surprised he knew my name, my game, and what I could do, and that was pretty cool,\u201d Dellavedova says.\n\nCleveland, which hadn\u2019t made the top 10 in the previous four seasons, reached the best-of-seven NBA finals in the 2014-2015 season. Dellavedova played all six games against the Golden State Warriors, the star-studded team hailing from San Francisco led by sharp shooter Steph Curry. \u201cI was trying to mark Steph Curry; a tough job. We went up 2-1, but then we lost 4-2,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the 2015-16 season, he says James drove the team into another finals. The opponent was Golden State, again. This time the Warriors raced to a 3-1 series lead and were favourites to win the title once more.\n\nAt that point, Dellavedova says, he just went out and played. He didn\u2019t really think about the occasion, or how far he\u2019d come from Maryborough.\n\n\u201cI was so focused on the job I had to do, I wasn\u2019t thinking about much else, just focusing on watching game tapes, trying to recover, getting my body right, and the game plan to do what I could to help the team win.\u201d\n\nCleveland went on to win three games in a row and snatched the title 4-3. In the process they become the first team to come back from 3-1 down to win an NBA championship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was not until I looked back and thought, \u2018Yeah it was a big deal\u2019,\u201d he grins. \u201cIt was an amazing experience and it was really cool to have my family there watching all the games.\n\n\u201cAnd it was kind of weird, like when I was on the court and they came down before the trophy presentation; you kind of see your whole career or life before you like a movie reel, all the things that went into getting to that moment because they\u2019ve supported me the whole way, and I\u2019m just from Maryborough.\n\n\u201cSo, it was pretty cool to celebrate on the court afterwards with them and then in the locker room.\u201d\n\nIt was Cleveland\u2019s drought-breaking title and the tough Australian\u2019s popularity was on show during the hometown victory parade. When the crowd began chanting \u201cDelly\u201d, James said, \u201cHe deserves that.\n\n\u201cIf there was a bear right here and there was Delly right here and I shot the ball and I was wondering who would get to the ball first, Delly would tear that damn bear up,\u201d James told the crowd.\n\nBy that time Dellavedova knew he would be leaving the Cavaliers and moving to the Milwaukee Bucks on a four-year deal. This time, however, the deal was worth almost $US10 million a year.\n\nBitcoin fan\n\nDellavedova is now playing for Melbourne United after his spell in Milwaukee \u2013 \u201cgreat people, but cold like Cleveland\u201d \u2013 a return to Cleveland and a season with the Sacramento Kings. He was recently cut from the Boomers World Cup squad, but has used the time to build his fitness.\n\nHe dispatches the beef brisket and veg, while I wonder how he came to love bitcoin and take a job as a vice president for business development at US bitcoin platform Swan Bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike millions of Americans, he says he started to trade stocks and options on the Robinhood smartphone app mainly to fight boredom during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The Cleveland team had caught the trading bug and even had a group message chat, where they boasted about winning trades or teased each other over losers.\n\nThe smoked beef brisket with a side of vegetables and salad. Luis Enrique\n\nDellavedova tells me he successfully used options contracts to bet on the sharemarket rising from its COVID-19 lows, but then he made a mistake. He thought the market had topped out and bet on it falling, but it kept rising and he gave back significant paper gains to close out the positions and break even.\n\n\u201cI realised the market was going to keep going up as the government was just printing money,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, it\u2019s more important to be smart about where you allocate your money. The most important thing about bitcoin is its fixed supply of 21 million. You can\u2019t print food, you can\u2019t print energy, but the US government is printing money to fund its fiscal deficit and pay $US1.6 trillion interest on its debt and prices are going up.\n\n\u201cSo, yeah, I see bitcoin as a store of value and hedge against inflation. I own property and looked at gold \u2013 I mean, [goldfield] Sovereign Hill Ballarat was 50 minutes away from where I grew up \u2013 but bitcoin is superior.\u201d\n\nHe won\u2019t say exactly how many bitcoin he owns, but admits it\u2019s \u201csignificantly more\u201d than his financial advisers and dad think is sensible.\n\nHe even wants to meet Australian superannuation funds to advocate for bitcoin as an asset class in diversified investment portfolios.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m still nervous about paying the bill in bitcoin and sense Jason behind me, shuttling among the tables, in his backyard idyll. Fortunately, Delly has a plan.\n\nTo pay the bill, Dellavedova tells me to download the Wallet of Satoshi app on my iPhone. Done. Next he uses his iPhone to photograph a QR code in the app on my phone and sends me 197,031 Satoshis (there are 100 million Satoshis to a single Bitcoin), worth $80 that day, via the Lightning Network that sends instant blockchain transfers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe fees are probably cheaper on the Lightning network, too,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that would\u2019ve been a couple of Sats [Satoshis] for the fees. It would\u2019ve been a fraction of a cent to do that versus 0.8 per cent or 1 per cent for a card.\u201d\n\nJason then uses his smartphone to digitally send me the bill of 149,250 Satoshis, which is equal to $61.\n\nA QR code scan later and I\u2019ve paid the bill in bitcoin. Entirely online, with the wealth transfers between Dellavedova, myself, and Jason never touching a bank account.\n\n\u201cSee I told you, no need to worry,\u201d Dellavedova says. And, with that, I\u2019m left to ponder the future of money.\n\nThe bill\n\nLittle Bertie\u2019s BBQ Cafe, 218 Swan St, Cremorne, Vic\n\nBeef brisket with vegetables and salad, $23.50\n\nPulled pork with vegetables and salad, $23.50\n\n2 long black coffees, $8\n\nOrganic cola, $6\n\nTotal: $61 (149,250 Satoshis)"

        "title": "Bitcoins: The Future of Investing? - Groww",
        "content": "Introduced in October 2008, Bitcoin marked a revolution in the history of global finances. This digital currency enabled peer-to-peer payment without any support or framework of financial institutions.\n\nBitcoin witnessed massive growth over the past few years. For example, its price jumped to around $20,000 during the bull market of 2017. Prices touched $60,000 in 2021 as the popularity of digital currency grew massively during the pandemic.\n\nWhat Makes Bitcoins Better Investments for the Future?\n\nBitcoin is right now the most prominent cryptocurrency worldwide in terms of market capitalisation. This digital currency has inspired the launch of several other cryptos in recent years.\n\nIt is a decentralised cryptocurrency that is not issued by any recognised banking system or by the government. This digital currency is produced through the computational powers of individuals, miners, and other groups of people involved in transaction verifications. They are then rewarded with Bitcoins.\n\nHere are the few parameters that make Bitcoins an exciting investment option for the future:\n\nTransparency and Security\n\nBitcoin transactions take place on a highly secure, decentralised, and encrypted system. The complex algorithms used on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain make it difficult to manipulate.\n\n\n\nThis makes Bitcoin one of the most secure and transparent systems for the future.\n\n\n\nWidespread Acceptance\n\nBitcoin being the largest and the oldest digital currency, is now accepted by various top global multinational companies, including Microsoft, AMC, Shopify, and more. This has further increased its legitimacy and popularity.\n\n\n\nNotably, El Salvador became the first country to accept Bitcoin as its legal tender.\n\n\n\nBaseline Value\n\nIn addition to having a robust and efficient blockchain technology, Bitcoin comes with significant intrinsic value. There are still millions of individuals who don\u2019t have access to basic banking facilities.\n\n\n\nThey can use this digital currency platform to transfer money across the globe. However, Bitcoin has yet to realise its non-banking potential.\n\n\n\nFlow\n\nFor Bitcoin, the market is fairly liquid.\n\nHow to Buy Bitcoins?\n\nThere is no doubt that Bitcoin will remain the most significant player in the crypto space in the upcoming years. Crypto enthusiasts looking to invest in Bitcoins can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Investors need to set up an account on any cryptocurrency investment platform that is available.\n\nStep 2: They need to complete the identity verification process and then deposit money from their bank accounts.\n\nStep 3: Now, they can purchase the number of Bitcoins they want.\n\nIn addition to crypto exchanges, one can buy Bitcoins with selected stockbrokers and on payment apps.\n\nOnce the money from the bank account gets transferred to one\u2019s exchange account, he/she can purchase Bitcoins. Investors need to specify the amount they wish to spend to buy the coins, review all necessary transaction details, and then confirm the purchase.\n\nRisks Involved\n\nOwning a Bitcoin can be highly profitable, given the astronomical rise this crypto has registered in the past few years. This crypto is now the most famous digital currency worldwide.\n\nRegardless of the profit and upside potential involved, it can be a volatile and high-risk investment. Investors should be aware of the volatility and speculative characteristics of the crypto space before investing in Bitcoin.\n\nAlso read, Top 10 Cryptocurrencies That Gave Highest Return\n\nFinal Word\n\nThe Government of India does not recognise any cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, as a legal currency as of now. The RBI has mandated banks and other regulated institutions not to provide any services involved with digital currencies. That being said, prospective crypto investors should assess all possible factors and take a call."

        "title": "Bitcoin: Monochrome boss Jeff Yew warns about 'billion dollar ticking time bomb' for SMSFs - The Australian Financial Review",
        "content": "\u201cInstead we see terms such as \u2018safe\u2019 and \u2018regulated\u2019 being used to suggest a level of safety that is unrelated to the SMSF trustees\u2019 legal obligation to secure legal ownership of the assets.\u201d\n\nMr Yew, former chief executive of cryptocurrency exchange Binance Australia, said the lack of clear regulations around exchanges and custody left SMSF investors in a legal grey area.\n\n\u201cThis creates a potential billion dollar ticking time bomb for SMSF trustees investing in crypto assets.\u201d\n\nInfant stages\n\nThe custody issue \u2013 precisely who owns a crypto asset \u2013 has become a major issue in investment circles after a string of blow-ups.\n\nThe most high-profile involved Bahamas-headquartered FTX, which saw founder Sam Bankman-Fried allegedly drain customer deposits for use in personal trading and venture capital bets. More than 30,000 Australians are embroiled in FTX\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrisbane-based super and SMF strategist Darren Kingdon said problems arose because exchanges were not handing over the digital keys, known as \u201ccold storage\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still very much in the infant stages,\u201d Mr Kingdon said. \u201cEven on the exchanges, like whose asset is it? Is it verifiably an SMSF asset or not?\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen with a few of the crypto disasters, just because the asset might be in an entity\u2019s name doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it stays that way.\n\n\u201cIt also doesn\u2019t prevent wrongdoing of bad actors and bad people in the space.\u201d\n\nBut there are exchanges that cater to SMSF investors and provide guidance for customers about setting up separate private wallets with digital keys.\n\nCrypto remains a small piece of the ballooning $876 billion SMSF sector. Tax data shows crypto investing peaked in September 2021, with more than $1.5 billion parked in digital assets, falling to $950 million in June this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCrypto and SMSFs are both innately about personal control and that\u2019s what is appealing about them,\u201d said Mat Merlehan from Tax on Chain, an advisory that helps investors with crypto assets.\n\n\u201cHowever, with personal control comes personal responsibility. You must adhere to the superannuation laws and regulations, which include proper custody of an SMSF\u2019s assets.\u201d\n\nMonochrome Asset Management chief executive Jeff Yew.\n\nMr Yew\u2019s Monochrome has been trying to get two new crypto ETFs approved. He has met with Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the ASX about getting the regulatory green light. The first attempt to launch crypto ETFs fizzled in Australia.\n\nIt\u2019s been part of a global attempt from asset managers to convince regulators of the benefit of ETF products which would give institutional and retail investors potentially safer exposure to crypto markets.\n\nThe US securities regulator has been so-far unwilling to approve any of the several applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF, wary the products do nor protect investors from market manipulation."
