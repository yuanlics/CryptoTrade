        "content": "How soon before most companies ask if you\u2019d like to pay for your order in Bitcoin? Will you be using smart contracts to manage your corporation\u2019s transactions with vendors and clients? Will \u201cblockchain technology\u201d become a coveted skill on resumes?\n\nIt\u2019s questions like these that interest Business Management Professor Nir Kshetri with UNC Greensboro\u2019s Bryan School of Business and Economics. He\u2019s had his finger on the pulse of emerging technologies that affect everything from salaries to e-commerce to cybersecurity.\n\nMost recently, he is advancing research on cryptocurrency and the Metaverse, a burgeoning digital environment for people to interact, shop, and work through virtual reality, augmented reality, or gaming engines. Both of these tools could one day become an ordinary part of doing business.\n\n\u201cStudents need to learn about this,\u201d says Kshetri. \u201cThey might be doing work in the Metaverse. They might be collaborating in the Metaverse or launching a product in the Metaverse. They have to understand how these tools function. They have to be aware of the scams that exist.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s buying crypto?\n\nDr. Nir Kshetri\n\n\u201cIn the U.S. the last survey showed 16 percent of the U.S. population owns some type of crypto,\u201d Kshetri explains. \u201cIt may be more than that now.\u201d\n\nCryptocurrency has been around since the invention of Bitcoin in 2009. There are now about 20 thousand types of digital currency in circulation.\n\nWith that comes news reports of speculative booms and collapses, early investors becoming millionaires seemingly overnight, social media influencers promoting NFTs, and scandals such as the fall of the crypto exchange FTX. The U.S. government still looks at the ventures with skepticism. The risk of scams remains high.\n\n\u201cCrypto is defusing less rapidly than other technologies,\u201d said Kshetri. \u201cIt is a very complicated technology for people to understand.\u201d\n\nThe majority of mainstream cryptocurrencies, he says, are also not backed by any fiat currency or physical resource. \u201cThey are just decentralized ways of making payment.\u201d\n\nAs their value is determined by speculative interest, his advice to anyone curious in personally investing in cryptocurrency now is to keep its high risks at the front of the mind. \u201cIf you\u2019re not prepared to lose it all, you should not invest.\u201d\n\nFinancial lifelines\n\nCryptocurrencies Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Ripple (XRP).\n\nInternationally, cryptocurrency has created a new financial platform for people who never had even one electronic payment option. In countries where the fiat currency is hindered by economic upheaval or rapid inflation, it may keep a family alive.\n\n\u201cIn many developing countries, only ten percent of people have a bank account,\u201d says Kshetri. \u201cAccess to financial services is one of the most important tools that give people power.\u201d\n\nKshetri\u2019s most recent research focuses on cryptocurrency in developing and economically unstable countries such as Venezuela, where the bolivar\u2019s inflation rate is at 65,000 percent. Venezuelans living outside the country can send money back home as cryptocurrency without paying high exchange fees.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a new transfer agency focused on Latin America that can convert money into the bolivar,\u201d says Kshetri. \u201cThe transfer fee is less than one percent.\u201d\n\nHe also observed how people around the world sustained their families during the COVID-19 pandemic by playing online games through the Metaverse. \u201cA lot of people were locked down and could not work,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only way to make a living, in Venezuela, in the Philippines, Brazil, Ghana, was to go online and play games, using non-fungible tokens or NFTs.\u201d\n\nAt one point, 2.5 million daily active users played just one of these Metaverse games. The NFT value has since dropped by about 90 percent. But at the time, Kshetri says, \u201cthey were lifelines for many of the people playing.\u201d\n\nWhat do companies like about blockchains?\n\nCryptocurrencies use \u201cblockchains\u201d to record purchases. A blockchain works like a ledger, tracking purchases and exchanges of goods. Each interaction is recorded within a digital \u201cblock\u201d of data. The records are maintained by a peer-to-peer network of computers around the world.\n\nMetaverse, which is still in early development, will utilize virtual reality.\n\nShould something happen to company servers, or a bad actor tries to sabotage the records, the other nodes in the network should cross-reference with each other and account for an incorrect or missing entry.\n\nThe possibilities of blockchains go beyond currency. They can be used to catalog inventory. They can cut out middlemen between the buyer and seller and therefore lower transfer fees. They provide a provable record for addressing disputes.\n\n\u201cOne application is called the \u2018smart contract,'\u201d says Kshetri. \u201cThe computer code enforces the contract. Say that you are a supplier to my company. After someone verifies that the shipment arrived, then the smart contract has the cryptocurrency automatically transferred from my account to your account without any intervention from people.\u201d\n\nThe future of digital commerce\n\nCryptocurrency\u2019s future will likely be decided by how stable it gets and what kinds of regulations come into play. Governments can\u2019t easily track how cryptocurrency is being spent, and whether it is being used for criminal or terrorist purposes. And setting regulations must be weighed against the rights of the individual.\n\n\u201cIf you have your hundred-dollar fiat currency right now, no one knows how you are spending it,\u201d says Kshetri. \u201cDigital currency has to guarantee some people a level of privacy. It also has to guarantee the government\u2019s ability to monitor that it is not going to adversaries.\u201d\n\nHowever cryptocurrency is implemented, Kshetri will be there to see how it evolves so that students, investors, and business owners capitalize on its potential.\n\n\u201cBlockchain is a good technology. Blockchain combined with cryptocurrency has many applications. They can be used to solve many problems in the world.\u201d\n\nStory by Janet Imrick, University Communications\n\nPhotography by Mike Dickens, Bryan School of Business and Economics; and Jiyoung Park, University Communications\n\nGraphics by Jaysen Buterin and De\u2019Andre Gilliard, University Communications"

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM=\n\nETH.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nJonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin briefly fell 8% to below $20,000 on Friday, hitting a near-two-month low, after a stock market sell-off in the U.S. and the collapse of a crypto-focused lender. The cryptocurrency market saw more than $70 billion wiped off its value over the course of the 24 hours. Bitcoin was last trading lower by just 2.7% at $19,944.66, according to Coin Metrics. Ether was last down 2.6% at $1,414.21. The crypto sell-off has been prompted by a number of factors. The movement of cryptocurrency prices is quite closely correlated to U.S. stock markets, in particular the tech-heavy Nasdaq .\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that interest rates may go higher \u2014and stay higher \u2014 than expected. The raising of interest rates over the past year has weighed on risk assets such as stocks, and in particular cryptocurrencies. \"There is just little reason to buy bitcoin now as the market is saturated with negative developments, not just specifically for the crypto industry, but also for the wider financial market as well,\" Yuya Hasegawa, an analyst at Japanese crypto firm Bitbank, told CNBC via email.\n\nBanking worries\n\nAnother major factor weighing on crypto prices is the collapse of Silvergate Capital, a major lender to the crytpo industry. Silvergate said Wednesday it is winding down operations and liquidating its bank. Silvergate's fall is another example how the collapse of major cryptocurrency exchange FTX continues to have an impact on the industry. FTX was a big customer of Silvergate. Separately, on Friday morning the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation closed Silicon Valley Bank and took control of its deposits, making it the largest U.S. bank failure since the global financial crisis. The bank's parent company, SVB Financial, said late Wednesday that it sold off $21 billion worth of its holdings at a $1.8 billion loss. SVB was a major bank in the technology start-up space.\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "Bitcoin fell to near the US$20,000 support line in Friday morning trading in Asia, while Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies slid to cap off a week of mostly red ink. Crypto prices followed equities lower as U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week warned interest rates may need to go higher than expected to curb inflation. The insolvency of crypto bank Silvergate on Wednesday added more downward pressure to crypto prices. Shiba Inu led the losers. Another negative is the increasingly public conflict between U.S. regulators on whether to define crypto assets as securities or commodities.\n\nSee related article: CFTC chair calls Ethereum a commodity, in contrast to SEC chair Gensler\u2019s position\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin slid 7.41% in the past 24 hours to US$20,127 as of 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, reaching a low for the month. The price of the largest cryptocurrency has fallen 14.10% in the past seven days, but is still up over 20% from the start of the year.\n\nEther fell 7.17% to US$1,426, posting a weekly loss of 13.25%.\n\nShiba Inu lost 8.89% in the 24 hours for a seven-day loss of 16.94%. Litecoin replaced the meme token as the 10th largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency but did not fare much better, falling 8.67% to US$75.63, for a loss of 20.35% for the past week.\n\nSilvergate Bank said on Wednesday that the U.S.-based crypto financial services company will liquidate, triggering a price slump that has wiped out over US$60 billion from the crypto market capitalization in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 6.15% in the past 24 hours to US$934.43 billion. Total trading volume in the period rose 33.47% to US$59.39 billion.\n\nAdding to crypto investors\u2019 concerns, New York State Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against crypto exchange Kucoin on Thursday, which alleged that Ether and some other crypto assets are securities and should be registered as such. This was the first time that Ether was claimed to be a security by a U.S. attorney general in court. Other U.S. regulators are in public dispute about whether Ether is a commodity or a security, an argument that will affect the status of scores of crypto tokens.\n\nFollowing Silvergate\u2019s failure, cryptocurrency exchange Blockchain.com said on early Friday it was winding down its U.K.-based asset management arm, adding to a raft of retrenchments across the industry since the collapses of the Terra-Luna stablecoin and the FTX exchange last year.\n\nU.S. equities slid on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.66% lower, the S&P 500 dropped 1.85%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.05%.\n\nFed chair Powell said in testimony on Capitol Hill this week that higher-than-expected interest rates might be needed to curb inflation, depending on the latest economic readings. One data point out on Friday is the February employment report, with analysts forecasting 225,000 new jobs added and a yearly increase in average hourly wages of 4.8%, according to CNBC. If the numbers are as expected, it would support the Fed\u2019s view that inflation remains a problem in the economy.\n\nInterest rates in the U.S. are between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007. Analysts at the CME Group predict a 60.9% chance the Fed will raise rates by 50 basis points this month, down from the 78.6% prediction on Thursday. They forecast a 39.1% chance for a 25-basis-point raise, a sharp reversal from the majority view last month.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, expects rates may peak at 6% this year and remain there for an extended time to get inflation back to the central bank\u2019s preferred range of 2%, CNBC reported, citing BlackRock\u2019s chief investment officer of global fixed income Rick Rieder.\n\nThe U.S. annual inflation rate is 6.4% for the 12 months ended January 2023, according to Labor Department data published Feb. 14. The next inflation update is scheduled for March 14 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.\n\nSee related article: Crypto bank Silvergate to close, return all deposits; becomes latest victim of 2022 crypto turmoil"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Are Crashing Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nCryptocurrencies have had a rough couple of days as word spread that the influential Silicon Valley Bank, which trades under SVB Financial Group (SIVB.Q -36.36%), is facing a liquidity crisis. While this isn't directly a hit to crypto, many venture capital firms use Silicon Valley Bank, so there's a risk of a broader financial impact, which is why cryptocurrencies are down Friday.\n\nAs of 10:30 a.m. ET, Bitcoin (BTC 1.67%) had fallen by 8.5% over the prior 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH -1.09%) had fallen 8.8%, and Solana (SOL 10.64%) was down 5.7%. Looking further back, over the past seven days, those cryptocurrencies are down 11.2%, 10.7%, and 18.5% respectively.\n\nSo what\n\nThe two major events of the past week have been the collapse of Silvergate Capital and the potential collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Silvergate provided a direct gateway into cryptocurrencies for many wealthy investors and institutions, and even operates many publicly traded funds. But it was seen as a more crypto-specific bank.\n\nThis week's bank run on Silicon Valley Bank is more concerning for the broader tech ecosystem. It is used by many start-ups and provides services small companies need in order to scale their businesses quickly.\n\nContagion, or cascading risks from one entity to another, is the biggest fear here. That could lead to less lending and investors pulling back their investments. Silicon Valley's venture capital firms provide the fuel for the tech ecosystem, and anything that impacts them could impact a lot of smaller start-ups.\n\nAs far as crypto goes, dozens of blockchain start-ups have been funded by venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. If they face pressure from regulators, banks and ultimately, investors, they may not be able to build the tools and services that are intended to make cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana more useful, and thus more valuable.\n\nIn short, these ecosystems are intertwined, and the fear this week is that a collapse of Silicon Valley Bank will make this crypto winter even worse.\n\nNow what\n\nThe risk to financial institutions can't be understated because they're critical to making the financial system work. When lending pulls back all at once or there's a credit crisis, there can be an economywide impact, as we saw in 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe Labor Department's February jobs report Friday morning did provide some positive news. The U.S. economy added 311,000 non-farm jobs last month, but more people entered the workforce to seek jobs, so the unemployment rate rose to 3.6%. So far, the tech sector slowdown, the crypto collapse, and the downfall of some banks haven't spilled over to the broader economy.\n\nInvestors with a long-term view should start looking at this as a buying opportunity for high-quality cryptocurrencies. Despite the downturn in token values, the crypto industry continues to grow and innovate, which is ultimately what's going to drive value.\n\nI don't know if we are at or even near the bottom, but I am betting on innovation in the blockchain winning in the long term. The Ethereum and Solana blockchains are where most developers are building, and that's where I'm looking to be a buyer if this crash gets worse."

But crypto executives and investors \u2014 who have endured a year of near-constant upheaval \u2014 seized on the moment to preach and scold.\n\nCentralized banking was to blame, the crypto advocates said.

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nFew people understand the key technical issues currently facing the world\u2019s dominant cryptocurrency. Andrew Chow is one of them.\n\nChow is one of four \u201cmaintainers\u201d for Bitcoin Core (or just Core), the most popular software for connecting to the Bitcoin network.\n\nMaintainers review changes to Bitcoin Core known as \u201ccommits,\u201d which are submitted \u2013 by fellow Bitcoin developers \u2013 as \u201cpull requests\u201d or \u201cPRs.\u201d Chow and other maintainers then approve or \u201cmerge\u201d those changes into Core\u2019s source code. The \u201ccode review\u201d is critical to ensuring no buggy code gets merged.\n\nThe process is transparent, and as Chow combs through commits he livestreams the process on Twitch.\n\nChow is a gamer at heart, and only got into Bitcoin in high school to pay for video games he couldn\u2019t otherwise afford. His parents wouldn\u2019t give him a credit card, open a bank account for him or even give him an allowance. He resorted to freelancing on the BitcoinTalk forum and began writing code in exchange for bitcoin (BTC).\n\nChow, who says he's now in his mid-20s, gets paid as an engineer at the Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream, where aside from a few corporate tasks, his main priority is working on Bitcoin Core.\n\nHe says code review is one of the biggest challenges Bitcoin faces today. Most Core developers are keen on writing code for new features, but few enjoy the more mundane task of reviewing code submitted by their peers. Chow says more contributors need to focus on code review to tackle the 300-plus PRs in Core\u2019s GitHub repository. The community has a Bitcoin Core PR Review Club that meets weekly to help newer contributors learn about the review process.\n\nChow agreed to an interview with CoinDesk at the Advancing Bitcoin conference in London. He elaborated on why code review is so critical, explained what Bitcoin Core contributors do every day, and weighed in on the current debate over op_vault and Speedy Trial. Here\u2019s a partial transcript of that interview.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoinDesk: How did you discover Bitcoin?\n\nAndrew Chow: When I was younger, in high school, I didn't have a bank account because I was under 18. My parents didn't open one for me. I didn't have a credit card \u2013 even a supervised credit card \u2013 and I didn't have an allowance. But Steam was selling games for bitcoin. If you do PC gaming, you can download Steam and it has basically all the PC games.\n\nAlso, on purse.io, you could sell bitcoin for stuff. Well, I wanted to play games. I wanted to buy them. I mean, I'm okay with pirating but, you know, pirating things is kind of sketchy. You don't know what you're downloading. It could be complete malware.\n\nSo I was, like, this bitcoin thing is fully electronic. Maybe I can use that to buy games \u2013 but how do I get bitcoin? Maybe I can do some work and get paid in bitcoin.\n\nI know a few people who did that. So that's how I learned programming. I\u2019d go on BitcoinTalk and people would say, \u201cI will pay you however much to write me a script that does this.\u201d\n\nWell, that seemed simple enough. I also had a friend in high school. He was, like, \u201cHey, have you heard about this bitcoin thing? I think you might like it.\u201d He was definitely buying drugs with bitcoin.\n\nSo that's how I got into Bitcoin. And eventually I was like, \u201cWell, I'm using this wallet and I'm running into these issues. I clearly know how to write a program. Maybe I can fix this wallet.\u201d That's how I got into doing development.\n\nI was running this thing called Armory. Which was basically not maintained. I mean, it's still kind of maintained by one guy, so barely.\n\nBy the time I was using it, it was kind of a mess and it didn't always work. I was finding that some of the problems that were happening in Armory were caused by things that Bitcoin Core was doing. So I started going into Bitcoin Core and asking what\u2019s Bitcoin Core doing? Oh, Bitcoin Core has this bug that's causing us to have a bug.\n\nArmory was doing something not recommended, which was to read the block files directly from Bitcoin Core \u2013 you're not supposed to do that. When they changed the format, it broke everything.\n\nI was trying to reconcile the two, and then Armory just kind of fell off my map. That's how I transitioned to Bitcoin Core. I eventually stopped working on Armory because I got more done on Core.\n\nYesterday we talked about the ratio of Bitcoin contributors who review code versus contributors who write code. Can you share your thoughts on that?\n\nOur main bottleneck in Bitcoin Core has been review. We have 300-plus PRs open and they need to be reviewed. Whether it\u2019s just to make sure the code is good or just conceptually like, \u201cDo we even want this change?\u201d\n\nThe problem with every PR is that one person usually writes it, but we need multiple people to review it, give an approval or leave comments. Therefore, we must have more reviewers than people writing, but that's just not how it works.\n\nPersonally, I find code review to be a little bit boring. It's a little annoying and it can be kind of mind-numbing. But I still do it. I guess it's like a necessary evil and it's because I don't find it fun. If I do it enoug I start feeling like I\u2019ll burn out because it's no longer enjoyable.\n\nSo you have to find some balance between writing code and reviewing code. It\u2019s a bit of a catch-22. We have to have more reviewers than coders, but how do you become competent enough to review code if you're not writing code? It's a conundrum.\n\nWe're in a bear market and organizations like Brink that fund Bitcoin development are saying funding is down by about 50%. Why do we need to pay Bitcoin contributors and developers?\n\nFundamentally, every piece of software has bugs. There will always be bugs to find and bugs to fix. That's just general software maintenance that must happen.\n\nAnd even then, the software that exists now cannot last forever. Operating systems will evolve and libraries will evolve and change. Eventually the software will just stop compiling on a computer; it might just stop running. And so, there needs to be constant work just to keep it up to date.\n\nSo there are always things to update, even without new features. But there are new features and we do want to improve Bitcoin. Not just the consensus rules, but also how we relay transactions, what kind of transactions we accept into the mempool and the peer-to-peer protocol.\n\nThere can be DoS vectors we want to fix or change that maybe haven't been discovered yet. There's always something.\n\nIf I'm a new Core contributor, what are some of the big issues I would need to know about?\n\nThere are currently a number of issues that exist, like pinning attacks, that are pretty well documented. It seems to be that no one exploits them, but that's not a good reason to not fix them.\n\nThere's been a lot of work on the mempool \u2013 how and what transactions are accepted into the mempool, what methods there are for fee bumping, and things like that. It's relevant to Lightning and other [layer 2] networks.\n\nWhat\u2019s a \u201cpinning attack?\u201d\n\nIf both of us open a Lightning channel together, I can make it so that you can never bump the fee on that transaction. So I can make it perpetually low-fee and it never gets mined, then try to double-spend it later.\n\nThere's a bunch of attacks you can do with the existing mempool policy rules. These are documented on the mailing list and they're definitely problems. If someone tried to exploit them it would be annoying, but I don't think we've seen anyone try to exploit them.\n\nWe still want to fix them and there's been a lot of work on making improvements so that we don't have these pinning attacks, or at least, if you want to pin a transaction, it'll be really expensive.\n\nWe also discussed op_vault and Speed Trial yesterday. There have been some tensions around James O\u2019Beirne\u2019s recommendation to deploy op_vault using Speedy Trial. Any comments?\n\nWith a new proposal like that, deployment should be the last thing to think about.\n\nSome ideas on how to deploy things are, for some reason, contentious. If you want to have a discussion about the proposal, having deployment in there kind of causes it to be derailed.\n\nSo I do think James putting that in there was probably a mistake. The Taproot deployment section wasn't defined until after Taproot. The code changes themselves were merged into Bitcoin Core but not active. It's not unusual to just say we'll deal with deployment after we figure out what we want the code changes to be.\n\nSpeedy Trial was an experiment for Taproot. We've tried different deployment methods over the years with varying degrees of success."

But our customers spend and receive dollars, or spend and receive euros, or spend and receive stablecoins.\u201d\n\nThe service works if Bitcoin is $1 or $1 million, Mallers said. The business isn\u2019t reliant on the price but is \u201cusing it as a technological innovation in the world of payments.\u201d\n\nWe discussed Mallers\u2019 backstory, how he got into the Bitcoin scene as a young adult, whether the Lightning Network could be better than the payment networks that exist today and how big players can enter the space. This episode was heavily focused on Bitcoin, so buckle up.\n\nWe also dove into:\n\nLightning Network\u2019s global potential\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin\n\nCreating new infrastructure to make Bitcoin more accessible\n\nThe future of the Strike and Bitcoin ecosystems\n\n\u201cI do think Lightning will serve as the single value transfer protocol for the earth,\u201d Mallers said. \u201cBut, I think, as we evolve in the early innings of this journey, the lowest-hanging fruit is: how do you get fiscal value across planet earth? That\u2019s why we start there and focus there.\u201d\n\nChain Reaction comes out every other Thursday at 12:00 p.m. PT, so be sure to subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the latest in web3 and crypto."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) hashprice has significantly plummeted in recent weeks, dropping to its early January levels \u2014 a potential sign that the mining bull run might be over.\n\nHashprice measures the market value for each unit of hashing power. BTC\u2019s price determines Hashprice\u2019s value alongside the network difficulty and transaction fees.\n\nWith BTC\u2019s network difficulty soaring to new all-time highs and the asset\u2019s value dropping to a two-month low, miners could face a hard time as hashprice fell to $61.38/P.H./Day, according to hashrate index data.\n\nWhat does this mean for miners?\n\nHashrate Index researcher Jaran Mellerud said Bitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty and hashrate soared by over 20% in 2023 following the digital asset improved price performance.\n\nHe noted that BTC\u2019s performance incentivized many marginal operators to turn on their machines, which increased market competition.\n\nHowever, the flagship digital asset\u2019s crash below $20,000 has erased half of the gains it made in 2023. This means miners face a 2022-like situation where BTC\u2019s falling value made mining unprofitable.\n\nMellerud highlighted that BTC\u2019s hashrate would likely increase as more miners plug in their machines in the coming months. Already, several miners have revealed intentions to increase their mining capacity by bringing more devices online.\n\nMellerud added:\n\n\u201cIf hashprice is to stay at the current level, the Bitcoin price must increase considerably\u2026 The recent hashprice development shows the importance of hedging revenues.\u201d\n\nMiners face a 30% crypto-mining tax\n\nU.S.-based BTC miners\u2019 situation could be compounded by the proposed 30% taxation on all energy costs involved in cryptocurrency mining.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s 2024 budget plan included a new tax proposal on crypto mining. The government said crypto mining activities require colossal energy usage and could hurt the environment. It added that mining activities could raise electricity prices and cause uncertainties around local energy utilities.\n\nThe CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, Dennis Porter, described the proposal as \u201cunfair and targeted discrimination.\u201d He added that the taxation would \u201ceffectively kill Bitcoin mining in the USA.\u201d\n\nPublic miners\u2019 stock tank\n\nFollowing the series of events, the stocks of several Bitcoin miners have tanked in the last 24 hours.\n\nAccording to Google Finance data, Riot\u2019s stock is down 12.22% to $5.53, while Hut 8 shares fell 14% to $1.75. Marathon Digital and Canaan also saw their shares decline by 11% and 7%, respectively.\n\nMentioned in this article"

President Biden's recent proposal to impose a 30% tax to reduce mining activity within the United States has undoubtedly played a significant role in this decline,\u201d Jeff Mei, COO of crypto exchange BTSE, told Decrypt.\n\nAccording to Mei, \u201cthis tax proposal has raised concerns among investors, who fear it could lead to decreased profitability and lower adoption of crypto mining in the U.S.\u201d\n\nNew York Attorney General Sues KuCoin, Claims Ethereum Is a Security\n\nMei also cited the recent lawsuit filed against KuCoin by the NY Attorney General's Office and hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell regarding a possible uptick in inflation among the reasons that have also contributed to the market's decline.\n\nAccording to the COO, all these factors combined have created \u201ca perfect storm,\u201d which eventually led to the crypto market's biggest crash this year.\n\nYet, BTSE remains bullish on the long-term prospects of the crypto market.\n\n\u201cWe see strides being taken in regulatory clarity and infrastructure creation around the world, especially in Asia, setting the industry on a great path for future innovation and adoption,\u201d Mei told Decrypt."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether tumbled during Asia trading hours on Friday afternoon, with Dogecoin leading losses among the top 10 largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, pressured by crypto bank Silvergate\u2019s liquidation announcement, and a new U.S. tax proposal on crypto mining. Equities also weakened, pressured by the prospect of higher-than-expected interest rates and a tighter U.S. labor market. The Forkast 500 NFT index also closed lower on the day.\n\nSee related article: Bank bust\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin fell by 7.96% in the past 24 hours, to trade at US$19,929 by 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. Ether lost 8.2% to change hands at US$1,409, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBitcoin and Ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies, were pressured by crypto bank Silvergate Capital\u2019s announcement to cease operations and liquidate its banking unit. Crypto investors also reacted to the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden proposing an excise tax on crypto mining equal to 30% of the electricity cost used.\n\nThe crypto fear and greed index, which measures crypto market sentiment, declined to 34, its lowest since Jan. 13 and reflected market concern among investors.\n\nDogecoin was the worst performer of the day, losing 8.58% to trade at US$0.06546, followed closely by the Shiba Inu token, which fell 8.09% to US$$0.00001007.\n\nThe global crypto market cap decreased 6.62% over the last 24 hours to US$928.9 billion, with the total crypto market volumes rising by 60.53% to US$69.37 billion.\n\nThe Forkast NFT 500 index fell 1.7% to 4,164.86 over the last 24 hours, with Moonbirds down 12.77% as the biggest decliner, followed by the Bored Ape Kennel Club that lost 17.91%. The Forkast NFT 500 Index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day.\n\nAsian equity markets weakened, mirroring Wall Street\u2019s overnight downtrend, amid mounting concern that the U.S. Fed\u2019s key interest rate will end up higher than expected, combined with a tighter U.S. labor market.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 1.67%, the Shanghai Composite Index lost 1.4%, the Shenzen Component declined 1.19% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index ended the day 3.04% lower, its lowest close in 11 weeks.\n\nEuropean stocks also tumbled on Friday. The STOXX 600 fell 1.7% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 lost 1.81%, as investors worldwide remained cautious after shares of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a major lender to technology startups, plunged more than 60% on Thursday. The SVB chaos led to four of the biggest U.S. banks losing more than US$50 billion in market value.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release its February job report on Friday, which will include two key metrics that may provide hints on the Fed\u2019s upcoming decision on interest rates, unemployment and nonfarm payroll. Analysts are forecasting 225,000 new jobs added, according to CNBC.\n\nSee related article: CFTC chair calls Ethereum a commodity, in contrast to SEC chair Gensler\u2019s position\n\n(Updates to the ninth bullet to add information on Silicon Valley Bank jitters and adds corrections to unemployment data in the last bullet.)"

        "title": "17 biggest crypto heists of all time - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Let's take a look at the biggest crypto thefts of all time in this article. Also, the article will outline why crypto exchanges keep getting hacked; why are crypto heists getting larger and what we can do to protect ourselves from crypto heists.\n\nDue to the funds being placed digitally (most of the time), hackers find it easier to steal virtual currencies than physical cash. Also, cryptocurrencies stored in huge sums can be transferred anonymously, leading to major heists in the crypto industry.\n\nBitcoin ( BTC ) came into the picture after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09 to prevent the world from financial crises in the future. However, as evidenced by various cryptocurrency scams since their introduction to the world, cryptocurrencies also do not provide enough security to the users' funds.\n\nCrypto fraudsters, especially scammers, prey on naive buyers in the physical world by reading the fine print in contracts.\n\nWhat are the biggest cryptocurrency heists in history?\n\nThe biggest crypto heists to date are MT Gox, Linode, BitFloor, Bitfinex, Bitgrail, Coincheck, KuCoin, PancakeBunny, Poly Network, Cream Finance, BadgerDAO, Bitmart, Wormhole, Ronin network, Beanstalk, Harmony Bridge, and FTX.\n\nMT Gox\n\nMt. Gox remains the greatest cryptocurrency robbery in history, with over 850k Bitcoin stolen between 2011 and 2014. Mt. Gox claimed that a fault that caused the loss is due to an underlying bug in Bitcoin, known as transaction malleability. Transaction malleability is the process of altering a transaction's unique identifier by altering the digital signature that was used to produce it.\n\nIn September 2011, it was discovered that MtGox's private keys were compromised, and the firm did not use any auditing techniques to discover the breach. Furthermore, because MtGox re-used Bitcoin addresses regularly, the stolen set of keys was used to steal new deposits constantly, and by mid-2013, over 630k BTC had been taken from the exchange. Surprisingly, WizSec (a group of Bitcoin security specialists) claims that proof of ongoing theft may be gleaned from blockchain transactions to support this assertion.\n\nMany companies use cold and hot wallets to minimize large losses, as shown with Mt. Gox. All coins are transmitted to the exchange's cold wallet, which is manually transferred to the hot wallet as necessary. If an exchange's server is hacked, the thief can only steal money from the hot wallet, allowing the exchange to decide how many coins it is prepared to risk.\n\nLinode\n\nLinode, a web hosting firm, was utilized by Bitcoin exchanges and whales of the community to store their hot wallets. Linode was hacked in June 2011, and the virtual services that stored the hot wallets were targeted.\n\nUnfortunately, this resulted in the theft of at least 46k BTC, the actual number of which is still unknown. Bitcoinia, which lost over 43k BTC, and Bitcoin.cx, which lost 3k BTC, were among the casualties, as was Gavin Andresen (Bitcoin developer), who also lost 5k BTC.\n\nBitFloor\n\nWhile these thefts are less severe, high-impact Bitcoin burglaries have continued, with 24k BTC stolen from BitFloor in May 2012. An attacker gained access to an unprotected (i.e., unencrypted) backup of wallet keys and stole the virtual currency worth roughly a quarter-million dollars in the crime. As a result, BitFloor creator Roman Shtylman decided to shut down the exchange.\n\nBitfinex\n\nThe usage of multisig (the requirement of multiple keys to authorize a BTC transaction) is not a silver bullet in and of itself, as evidenced by another huge heist at Bitfinex, which resulted in the theft of 119,756 BTC.\n\nBitfinex exchange had teamed up with BitGo to act as a third-party escrow for customer withdrawals. Bitfinex also appears to have chosen not to use cold wallets in order to obtain a statutory exemption from the Commodities and Exchange Act. While the idea of employing threshold signatures is appealing, it does not guarantee that the authority to authorize transactions is spread.\n\nBitgrail\n\nBitgrail was a small Italian exchange that traded in obscure cryptos like Nano (XNO), previously known as RaiBlocks. Nano was worth as little as 20 cents in November 2017; however, when prices lingered around $10, the exchange was hacked in February 2018, putting BitGrail's losses at $146 million.\n\nThe cyber theft of a cryptocurrency deceived more than 230,000 people. Unfortunately, small exchanges do not implement basic protection, such as a cold storage wallet, putting a lot of money at risk. According to the director of the national center for cyber crimes, Ivano Gabrielli, it became evident that the BitGrail CEO was implicated in the BitGrail scandal.\n\nCoincheck\n\nCoincheck, based in Japan, had $530 million worth of NEM (XEM) tokens stolen in January 2018. The identity of the Japanese hackers who broke into the security system is still a mystery.\n\nFollowing the investigation, Coincheck revealed that hackers were able to gain access to their system due to a staffing deficit at the time. The hackers were able to comprise the system successfully due to funds being kept in hot wallets and insufficient security measures in place.\n\nKuCoin\n\nKuCoin announced in September 2020 that hackers had obtained private keys to their hot wallets before withdrawing substantial quantities of Ethereum (ETH), BTC, Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Tron (TRX) and Tether (USDT). Lazarus Group, a North Korean hacker group, has been accused of committing a robbery on cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin, resulting in a $275 million loss of funds. However, the exchange was able to recoup approximately $240 million in payments later.\n\nPancakeBunny\n\nThe flash loan attack, in which hackers were able to siphon $200 million from the platform, occurred in May 2021 and is among the more severe cases of cryptocurrency theft. The hacker loaned a big sum of Binance Coin (BNB) before manipulating its price and selling it on PancakeBunny's BUNNY/BNB market to carry out the attack.\n\nA flash loan must be borrowed out before repaying the amount all at once. The hacker obtained a large number of BUNNY via a flash loan, then dumped all of the BUNNY on the market to lower the price, and then repaid the BNB using PancakeSwap.\n\nPoly Network\n\nIn August 2021, a hacker stole approximately 600 million USD worth of digital tokens in one of the greatest cryptocurrency thefts ever. A hacker known as \"Mr. White Hat\" exploited a weakness in the network of Poly Network, a DeFi platform.\n\nThe narrative has gotten stranger by the day since the initial theft. Mr. White Hat not only maintained a public and consistent dialogue with Poly Network, but they also returned everything that had been stolen a week later, except $33 million in Tether (USDT) that had been frozen by the issuers.\n\nMr. White Hat was once given a 500,000 USD prize for returning all stolen cash, as well as a job offer to become Poly Network's senior security officer.\n\nCream Finance\n\nThe hackers stole $130 million in Cream Finance's October 2021 incident. It was Cream Finance's third cryptocurrency robbery of the year in which hackers took $37 million in February 2021 and $19 million in August 2021.\n\nThe monies appear to have been obtained through a flash loan in a highly complicated transaction costing over 9 ETH in gas and involving 68 different assets. The attacker used MakerDAO's DAI to produce a huge number of yUSD tokens while also taking advantage of the yUSD price oracle computation.\n\nConsequently, on the Ethereum network, they were able to take all of Cream Finance's tokens and assets, totaling $130 million.\n\nBadgerDAO\n\nA hacker succeeded in stealing assets from multiple cryptocurrency wallets on the DeFi network, BadgerDAO, in December 2021. The incident is related to phishing when a malicious script was injected into the website's user interface via Cloudflare.\n\nThe hacker exploited an application programming interface (API) key to steal $130 million funds. The API key was created without the knowledge or permission of Badger engineers to inject malicious code into a fraction of its clients regularly. However, about $9 million was recovered as the hackers were yet to withdraw funds from Badger's vaults.\n\nBitmart\n\nIn December 2021, a hack of Bitmart's hot wallet resulted in the theft of about $200 million. At first, it was thought that $100 million had been stolen via the Ethereum blockchain, but additional research found that another $96 million had been stolen via the Binance Smart Chain blockchain.\n\nOver 20 tokens were taken, including altcoins such as BSC-USD, Binance Coin (BNB), BNBBPay (BPay), and Safemoon, as well as substantial quantities of Moonshot (MOONSHOT), Floki Inu (FLOKI) and BabyDoge (BabyDoge).\n\nWormhole\n\nAn attack on Wormhole, the Ethereum and Solana bridge, defrauded users of an estimated $328 million, ranking as the fourth-largest breach in the history of DeFi. The attacker used minted tokens to claim ETH that was held on the Ethereum side of the bridge by exploiting a mint function on the Solana side of the Wormhole bridge to create 120,000 wrapped Ethereum (wETH) for themselves, according to CertiK's (blockchain security and smart-auditing company) preliminary investigation.\n\nRonin Network (Axie Infinity)\n\nRonin Network, a cryptocurrency network focused on gaming, revealed on March 29, 2022, that it had been hacked and that a staggering $620 million had been lost. According to Etherscan, an attacker \"used hacked private keys to generate bogus withdrawals\" from the Ronin bridge over two transactions. The popular Axie Infinity game's publishers, Sky Mavis, and the Axie DAO were impacted by the exploit on Ronin validator nodes.\n\nBeanstalk\n\nThe governance protocol of Beanstalk, an Ethereum-based stablecoin platform, was the target of an attack in April 2022. The value kept in the Beanstalk protocol was given to the Ukraine fund after the fraudulent proposal was implemented, and the attacker(s) utilized it to repay their flash loan. Out of the $181 million that was stolen in the end, the assailant made a profit of $76 million.\n\nHorizon Bridge (Harmony)\n\nIn June 2022, hackers broke into Harmony Protocol, which allows transactions between Ethereum, Binance, and Bitcoin blockchains. They stole $100 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including ETH, Binance Coin (BNB), USDT, USD Coin (USDC), and Dai.\n\nFTX\n\nHackers stole $323 million from the Bahamas-based parent business FTX.com, $2 million from Alameda Research, and $90 million from its US platform in November 2022. However, FTX claimed to have recovered $1.7 billion in cash, $3.5 billion in purportedly liquid cryptocurrencies, and $300 million in liquid equities."

        "content": "Dogecoin (DOGE) pared some losses versus Bitcoin (BTC) on March 10, a day after the DOGE/BTC pair fell to its lowest level since October 2022. Can the DOGE price see an extended rebound ahead?\n\nOn the daily chart, the DOGE/BTC pair reached 331 sats, up 4.75% compared to the previous day\u2019s low of 316 sats. The bounce occurred around a multimonth descending trendline, which has capped the pair\u2019s downside moves since November 2022.\n\nDOGE/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nDOGE price vs. BTC\n\nInterestingly, the DOGE/BTC descending trendline appears to be part of a prevailing falling wedge pattern. Traditional chart analysts consider the falling wedge a bullish reversal setup, notably because of the pattern\u2019s 62% success rate in meeting its upside price targets.\n\nIn Dogecoin\u2019s case, the price is wobbling around its falling wedge\u2019s apex point, where its upper and lower trendlines converge. DOGE\u2019s latest rebound from the lower trendline increases its possibility of testing the upper trendline for a breakout, as illustrated in the chart below.\n\nDOGE/BTC daily price chart featuring falling wedge breakout. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upside setup further draws support from the DOGE/BTC\u2019s daily relative strength index (RSI), with a reading of around 28. From a technical perspective, an RSI below 30 means the pair is oversold, which could prompt its price to consolidate sideways or rebound.\n\nIn the event of a breakout, DOGE/BTC can rise toward 500 sats by April, up 50% from current price levels. The upside target is measured after adding the maximum distance between the falling wedge\u2019s upper and lower trendline to the breakout point.\n\nHowever, a decisive drop below the falling wedge\u2019s lower trendline risks invalidating the whole upside setup. Instead, DOGE can drop toward 280 sats, a historical support level down around 13% from current price levels.\n\nSuch a scenario is possible given Dogecoin\u2019s stint with a failed falling wedge pattern in March 2022, where the DOGE/USD pair broke below the lower trendline \u2014 50% losses followed.\n\nWhich way for DOGE price?\n\nHowever, Dogecoin could still fall in U.S. dollar terms, mainly due to increasing macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nIn recent years, the Dogecoin price rallied primarily on the heels of news-driven events and Elon Musk\u2019s support, including hopes of a DOGE payment option on Twitter.\n\nRelated: Why is the crypto market down today?\n\nHowever, Musk said on March 3 that he would shift his focus from cryptocurrencies to artificial intelligence. The billionaire entrepreneur didn\u2019t name Dogecoin specifically, but many interpreted that Musk may distance himself from the industry moving forward.\n\n\u201cI used to be in crypto, but now I got interested in AI\" \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 3, 2023\n\nThe price of Dogecoin has dropped by more than 20% to $0.06 since Musk\u2019s tweet. Moreover, from a technical perspective, the price is well-positioned to drop by another 10% in the coming weeks in a retest of an old support level at around $0.055\u20130.042.\n\nDOGE/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nConversely, a bounce from the support range could have DOGE\u2019s price rally test the triangle\u2019s upper trendline at around $0.076, resulting in gains of approximately 15% from current price levels.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Inscription mints via Bitcoin Ordinals reached a daily ATH.\n\nThe BRC-20 experiment has been deployed but users may need to be careful with minting in mass numbers.\n\nQuite a number of people cast doubts over the long-term relevance of Bitcoin [BTC] Ordinals after it launched in January.\n\nThe reason for this was because of the projection that miners would hesitate to work on NFTs within the Bitcoin network. But the recent landmark hit on 9 March, might have put an abrupt end to the skepticism.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nBRC-20: The spear opposing the doubting Thomases\n\nAccording to Dune Analytics, the number of Ordinals Inscriptions minted on the aforementioned data hit an All-Time High (ATH) of 31.692. The new frontier on the Bitcoin blockchain now has 392, 495 Inscriptions since inception.\n\nThese digital assets range from texts, audio, and applications to images. However, Inscriptions was able to reach the milestone mostly because of the text carving dominance.\n\nThis was because the information from the public blockchain tracker revealed that others were far off from reaching the share text Inscriptions gained.\n\nMoreso, most of the Inscriptions appeared after the BRC-20 execution. The BRC-20 offers a way for Ordinals users to mint and transfer their assets within the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThis hike meant that the BRC-20 chain on which the NFTs minting takes place has appreciated in user count. Although still in the experimental stage, the BRC-20 is a reflection of the Ethereum [ETH] ERC-20 standard.\n\nAdditionally, the rise in adoption could be linked to the public revelation of how to go about minting Ordinals and creating fungible assets on the blockchain.\n\nThere have been 23,926 BRC-20 ordinal inscriptions in the past 24 hours. It only took 6 weeks for people to figure out how to use ordinals to make fungible meme coins. At this point, nothing surprises me. pic.twitter.com/CnHD3qRTcA \u2014 Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) March 9, 2023\n\nHowever, there is a little misconception between Bitcoin Ordinals and Inscriptions. While Inscriptions are metadata that store transactions ran on Bitcoin nodes Ordinals are, however, tiny bits of Bitcoin called satoshis which users can use to apply different rarity traits to individual inscriptions.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Ordinals fees generated have risen up to 75.29 BTC. Despite the increase, the overtime size usage had decreased.\n\nIs the race to $5 billion still intact?\n\nBefore the milestone, Galaxy Research had developed a whitepaper with details of the Bitcoin Inscriptions. The 3 March analysis from the crypto insight platform noted that the Bitcoin NFTs operate very differently from the collections on the Ethereum blockchain\n\nRealistic or not, here\u2019s BTC\u2019s market cap in ETH\u2019s terms\n\nDefending its position on a possible $5 billion market valuation in the future, the research paper read,\n\n\u201cFrom a custody standpoint, inscriptions may actually be better than Ethereum NFTs, at least for institutional investors.\u201d\n\nDespite the success achieved, the BRC-20 developer advised that participants remain cautious and also avoid mass minting."

        "title": "Management Software Can Help Bitcoin Miners Realize Their Energy Potential - Nasdaq",
        "content": "With effective management software, bitcoin miners can take full advantage of the industry\u2019s unique efficiencies and potential profits.\n\nThis is an opinion editorial by Mitch Klee, an analyst at the mining management platform Foreman.\n\nAfter China banned bitcoin mining in May 2021, nearly 75% of global hash rate was dispersed and relocated to other countries such as Kazakhstan, Russia, the United States and Canada. Since the seemingly-devastating mining ban took hold in the mining hotbed of China almost two years ago, the landscape of Bitcoin mining has dramatically changed. Remarkably, hash rate has continued to grow and currently stands at around 320 exahashes per second (EH/s), with the U.S. alone estimated to account for almost 37% of all hashrate.\n\nThis hypercompetitive growth has prompted miners to seek more efficient ways to manage their operations at scale, with miner management software being a vital part of their strategy.\n\nUtilizing Bitcoin Mining Management Software\n\nManagement software is changing the landscape of Bitcoin mining by allowing mining facilities to manage their site effectively while saving costs and responding to energy grid demand.\n\nMiner management software is a way to organize and coordinate miners at scale. Starting up, configuring, and programming each ASIC is daunting, involving multiple steps such as establishing pool connections, completing firmware updates, managing power control, and diagnosing problematic hash boards. This setup process can be incredibly difficult when not using the right software. However, with effective miner management software, users can effortlessly manage their mines, ensuring optimal performance and productivity.\n\nThe programmable nature of this software empowers users to take control of various processes through conditional statements. For instance, if ASIC temperature reaches a certain threshold, it can activate sleep mode, or if the electricity price exceeds a certain threshold, it can curtail mining operations. The dynamic nature of the software allows users to control exactly how they'd like to set up their mine. Moreover, the dynamic nature of the miner software unlocks powerful capabilities such as managing the power grid and initiating demand response, providing users with a comprehensive solution for optimizing their mining operations.\n\nThe Importance Of Demand Response\n\nDemand response is the act of power consumers reacting to an increase in demand for a set amount of electricity on the grid. In a previous article, I expanded on Bitcoin miners' unique leverage through Demand response, which I recommend reading to learn more about how this relationship functions. In short, Bitcoin miners can respond more quickly to grid signals and at a larger scale than any other industry consumer can, without significantly hindering their profit margins.\n\nMining sites percolate across global energy markets, both on-grid and off-grid, finding any and all energy arbitrage opportunities. Similar to the properties of water, Bitcoin miners will follow and flow into the lowest-cost energy sources, consuming excess energy when needed. The flip side is that miner management software allows miners to respond to an increase in demand instantaneously, lowering the operating expenses and increasing the bottom line. This flexibility enabled by the software allows miners to optimize their operations continually, participate in unique grid service programs, and stay ahead of the competition.\n\nOne example is the strike price. When production costs exceed revenue, miners should shut off and management software enables this automatic trigger.\n\nMiner management software allows users to automatically and programmatically respond to high demand for electricity through the strike price mechanism. Couple that with demand response programs, and miners are now lowering their overall costs and getting paid to shut down by utility company demand-response programs.\n\nThis programmatic response to increased demand adds an operating system to the century-old grid, with large flexible loads responding in real-time at scale. Spread this out to grids worldwide, and Bitcoin mining has just created an equilibrium-responding mechanism to keep the grid balance in check. By funding excess production, can keep the lights on at scale while lowering overall grid electricity costs.\n\nOver the long run, bitcoin mining is a race to zero. Competition chases lower and lower spreads, looking for stranded and excess electricity, moving closer to power producers, and eliminating all excess costs. It's hard to say what the future holds for Bitcoin mining at scale. Still, software-enabled management over sites is becoming non-negotiable for miners as competition for more hash rate and lower electricity costs heats up.\n\nThis is a guest post by Mitch Klee.

        "content": "Bitcoin has slipped under the $20,000 level today for the first time in two months. Here\u2019s why this plunge may have taken place, according to on-chain data.\n\nBitcoin Price Dropped With Coinbase Premium Turning Negative\n\nAs pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the U.S. government\u2019s recent movement may have played a role in the latest decline in BTC\u2019s price. There are a couple of relevant indicators here: the Coinbase Premium and the Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB).\n\nThe \u201cCoinbase Premium\u201d measures the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and that listed on Binance. Coinbase is an exchange that\u2019s popularly used by U.S.-based investors (especially large institutions), while Binance has a more global-oriented audience.\n\nDue to this reason, the Coinbase Premium can provide hints about whether American holders are buying (or selling) more or less than global investors right now.\n\nWhen the value of the metric is positive, it means the price listed on Coinbase is greater than that on Binance currently, and hence the U.S.-based users have been putting on higher buying pressure than the global investors (or alternatively, they have just been selling less heavily).\n\nOn the other hand, negative values of the metric suggest that U.S. participants might be engaging in a higher amount of selling than the world user base at the moment.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows how the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium has changed over the past week:\n\nLooks like the value of the metric has gone down in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium has turned negative recently. This means that U.S. investors may have been putting some extraordinary selling pressure on the cryptocurrency during this period.\n\nInterestingly, the price of the coin has declined while the premium has become negative, which may suggest that U.S. participants may have had more of a hand in this latest plunge.\n\nThe chart also contains data for the other indicator of interest here, the \u201cSOAB,\u201d which tells us which age bands (or groups) in the market have been moving their coins recently.\n\nCuriously, the 6m-12m age band, which includes all Bitcoin investors that have been holding onto their coins for at least 6 months and at most 12 months ago, has shown a large movement just a few days ago.\n\nAs for the source of these aged coins, the quant explains, \u201cthe transaction is linked to bitcoins seized by the U.S. government because they are related to Silkroad.\u201d\n\nThe timing of this large Bitcoin transaction and the selling pressure rising on Coinbase is interesting and could suggest that there may be a link between the two.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say what impact this transaction had on the price drop because we can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening on the exchange,\u201d notes the analyst. \u201cBut everything suggests that it caused extra selling pressure.\u201d\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $19,800, down 11% in the last week.\n\nBTC has plunged over the past day or so | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin is underperforming nowadays. In the past several weeks, investors saw a profitable journey as the BTC price reversed from the two-year bottom. But again uncertainty remains in the market as per the price action.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Bitcoin price against USDT trades at $20,000. The market capitalization dramatically plumped by 8.16% in the last 24 hours and was recorded at $386 billion.\n\nBTC Price on 4-Hour Chart\n\nWe can see from the chart that Bitcoin price continuously slipped from the yearly high of $25,250. The bears have barely defended the $25,000 selling zone multiple times. Meanwhile, speculators are following the selling-on-top strategy and this downtrend may rest at $19,000 if BTC moves lower than the $20,000 mark.\n\nIn the recent bounce, the price structure drew an inverted pole and flag pattern. The breakdown of this bearish price structure brought an incredible opportunity for market sellers. Resulting in bears gaining more than 10% gain in the past seven days as per CoinMarketCap.\n\nIt appears buyers have lost dominance on Bitcoin, and this correction phase has turned into a downtrend as per aggressive selling and a 45-day vital support level ($21,500) breakdown.\n\nBTC on Daily Price Chart\n\nOn the daily price chart, bitcoin price is trading below the 20 and 50-day moving averages. Thus, yesterday\u2019s aggressive decline pushed the bitcoin price toward the 200 SMA. The 200 SMA (red) seems to be the last save zone for the buyers. Below this level, BTC could trade down to $18,400 before any significant rally.\n\nNotably, trading volume spiked higher by 64% overnight and reached $36 billion. The trading volume shows intense selling in BTC. Additionally, the daily RSI entered into extremely oversold territory. And any bounceback in RSI could lead to a BTC recovery, so this could be a good buying opportunity."

        "content": "The US government is considering several ways to balance its destabilised economy by reeling-in more funds into its financial systems. The crypto mining community in the US could face the burn of these tax hikes as the US government has proposed to raise the taxes on the electricity requirement for miners. The idea was part of US President Joe Biden's annual budget speech on March 9. From amending policies around the crypto sector, the Biden administration is reportedly expecting to churn over $24 billion (roughly Rs. 1,96,700 crore) to the US economy.\n\nThe tax imposed on the electricity usage by crypto mining firms could now go as high as 30 percent of total cost of the electricity that was used to facilitate the mining process in the US.\n\nWhile sufficing the US Treasury is among key reasons behind this proposal, the US is also looking to curb the excessive environmental impacts that have been known to be by-products of the energy-intensive crypto mining business.\n\n\u201cFirms engaged in digital asset mining would be required to report the amount and type of electricity used as well as the value of that electricity, if purchased externally. Firms that produce or acquire power off-grid, for example by using the output of a particular electricity generating plant, would be subject to an excise tax equal to 30 percent of estimated electricity costs,\u201d the US Treasury disclosed in an official post.\n\nThe excise tax for digital asset mining firms would be executed gradually, in a decided time frame of three years. It would start at a rate of 10 percent in the first year, 20 percent in the second, and 30 percent thereafter.\n\nOne of the few surprises in the Biden budget.

Phasing in at 10% in year one and climbing to 30%. pic.twitter.com/UPgUdr8CeG \u2014 John Buhl (@jbuhl35) March 9, 2023\n\nCrypto mining is the process of generating newer crypto tokens. Miners are required to solve complex algorithms to validate transactions happening on the blockchain and generate newer tokens as rewards and by-products.\n\nBefore 2021, China was emerging as the hotspot for crypto miners. After China imposed a blanket ban on all crypto activities in September 2021, miners flocked to other favourable locations including Kazakhstan, Russia, El Salvador, as well as regions in the US like Texas and New York State among others.\n\nThe US was named as the world's largest Bitcoin mining hub last year by Cambridge researchers. The crypto mining activities in the US in around 2021 reportedly made up for around 37 percent of the global hashrate, a metric used to measure the computing power used for mining.\n\nWith the job opportunities that the crypto mining business brings in, US' Kentucky state has begun evaluating cost-effective ways to generate electricity to support the mining industry.\n\n\u201cAn excise tax on electricity usage by digital asset miners could reduce mining activity along with its associated environmental impacts and other harms. The increase in energy consumption attributable to the growth of digital asset mining has negative environmental effects as well as increase energy prices for those that share an electricity grid with digital asset miners,\u201d said the US government, justifying the tax hike it plans to levy on the crypto mining business.\n\nThe implementation of this rule has been slated for next year.\n\nGaana, JioSaavn, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts,\n\nFrom smartphones with rollable displays or liquid cooling, to compact AR glasses and handsets that can be repaired easily by their owners, we discuss the best devices we've seen at MWC 2023 on Orbital , the Gadgets 360 podcast.

        "content": "In the spring of 2024, the next halving of Bitcoin will take place: what will be the impact on the price of BTC?\n\nSo far there have already been three halvings, and in all and among cases the price of Bitcoin the following year rose.\n\nThe past three halvings\n\nThe first halving occurred in November 2012, or just under four years after Bitcoin mining began on January 3, 2009, with the creation of the first block.\n\nAt that time Bitcoin was worth about $13, and the following year saw the first and largest speculative bubble that ever occurred in the price of BTC.\n\nIn fact, within about a year the price skyrocketed to a peak at $1,100, or an 8,300 percent gain in less than twelve months.\n\nIt must be said that the first halving brought down the inflation rate of Bitcoin\u2018s money supply.\n\nAll existing BTC was created as a premium for miners who validated blocks, and initially, that premium was 50 BTC per block.\n\nWith a block every 10 minutes or so, about 2.6 million bitcoins were being created annually, and since only 8 million BTC had been created by the end of 2011, the annual inflation rate of the Bitcoin money supply then was 32 percent.\n\nWith the first halving, the creation of new BTC dropped to 1.3 million per year, and since in meantime by the end of 2012 the BTC created had risen to 10.6 million, and the inflation rate of the Bitcoin money supply suddenly collapsed to 12 percent.\n\nSuch a sudden collapse almost instantaneously reduced the supply of BTC in the market, triggering a price growth due to relatively constant demand, which from January 2013 to November of that year generated that incredible percentage gain.\n\nIt is no coincidence that a large speculative bubble also inflated the year following the second halving.\n\nThe second halving\n\nThe second halving occurred in July 2016, but it did not immediately trigger growth.\n\nAt that time, the premium for miners rose from 25 to 12.5 BTC per block, bringing the number of new BTC minted each year to 650,000. Since by the end of 2016 a total of about 16 million BTC had already been created, the annual inflation rate of Bitcoin\u2019s money supply collapsed to 4 percent.\n\nThe price began to rise in October of that year and then soared especially from April 2017.\n\nDuring that year, the price reached $20,000, then a gain of 1,700 percent from the previous high in 2013.\n\nThe third halving\n\nThe third and final halving occurred in May 2020, when the premium for miners was raised to 6.25 BTC per block.\n\nSo since then just under 330,000 new BTC are created each year, and since 18.5 million Bitcoins had already been created by the end of 2020, the annual inflation rate of its money supply fell below 2 percent.\n\nIn November of that year, the price began to rise, and as early as the following month the last major bubble began to form.\n\nThis, however, brought the price of Bitcoin to just under $70,000 in November 2021, or a gain of only 250 percent from the previous peak.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s next halving and price predictions.\n\nSince a halving occurs automatically every exactly 210,000 blocks, and since the 840,000 block is only just under 60,000 blocks away, with a block mined every 10 minutes or so, it is estimated that the next halving will occur in spring 2024.\n\nAt that point, there will be more than 20.3 Bitcoins created, and the reduction to 160,000 new BTC created each year will bring the annual inflation rate of the Bitcoin money supply down below 1 percent.\n\nSo this will not be a real collapse, like the one that happened in 12% that suddenly brought this inflation rate from 32% to 12%, but a much smaller reduction that will bring it from less than 2% to less than 1%.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that the 2024 halving will immediately have a major impact on the price of BTC, that is, as early as spring or summer of the same year, because it will not reduce the supply in the market by much.\n\nMoreover, all three halvings that have already taken place have caused the price of Bitcoin to rise less and less, from +8,300% to +1,700% to +250%.\n\nIt is by no means impossible that in 2024, or 2025, the price of Bitcoin could increase, but it is unlikely to increase by those percentages.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that in recent years other cryptocurrencies have drained capital from the crypto markets, which were once concentrated mainly on Bitcoin, so all the more reason why the increase might be smaller, or even not there at all."

        "content": "Many cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin are trading at deep losses today. At the time of writing, some top coins including XRP, MATIC, and BNB, are all down by more than 5% in 24 hours, respectively. While BTC records a 7.88% loss in 24 hours, ETH is down by 8.89%.\n\nLooking at the weekly price losses, Bitcoin has lost 10.88% in the past 7 days while Ethereum has lost 10.94% in the same time frame. Other altcoins, such as BNB, have lost 6.62% and 6.66% in their 24-hour and 7-day price trend.\n\nThese losses today have plummeted the overall crypto market cap below $900 Billion, leaving it at $890 billion. As the market is bleeding, a staunch crypto critic Peter Schiff advises investors to sell BTC and buy gold now.\n\nMore Blockchain Related Crashes Are brewing\n\nIn a Twitter post today, Peter Schiff predicted that more bankruptcy cases would hit the industry, further deepening the crypto winter.\n\nIf #crypto really is the future, why is #Silvergate, the premier crypto bank already a thing of the past? A wave of #blockchain related bankruptcies will soon crash down on #CryptoCurrencies, turning the crypto winter into a deep freeze. Hurry, sell your #Bitcoin and buy #gold. \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 10, 2023\n\nNotably, Schiff mentioned Silvergate, the crypto-friendly bank that crashed recently, sending Bitcoin and other cryptos spiraling. Even though investors might not support Schiff\u2019s analysis, the recent bearish downtrend might fuel his assertions.\n\nBut even at that, some crypto enthusiasts still hold on to their strong belief in the industry. For instance, Peter\u2019s son Spencer Schiff responded to his dad\u2019s post, stating that blockchain companies and other cryptos might crash, but Bitcoin will be the lifeboat.\n\nCrypto and blockchain companies might go bankrupt but Bitcoin won\u2019t go down with that ship. It\u2019s actually the lifeboat \u2014 Spencer Schiff (@SpencerKSchiff) March 10, 2023\n\nAnother Twitter user also responded to his reference about Silvergate being a thing of the past, asking him if his bank is not a thing of the past.\n\nIs not your bank a thing of the past as well? \u2014 The Financial block (@financial_block) March 10, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, this is not Peter Schiff\u2019s first time urging investors to sell their holdings. His recommendation came as the market feared the release of the first CPI data for 2023. However, instead of plummeting, BTC spiked, reaching $25,000.\n\nU.S. Job Announcement Changes Price Pattern For Bitcoin And Others\n\nBased on macros influence, the latest Bureau of Labor and Statistics\u2019 Nonfarm Payrolls report will likely affect crypto prices. The report indicates that the United States added 311,000 jobs last month, above the prediction of 205,000. BTC is gaining slowly from its outright crash after Silvergate\u2019s announcement.\n\nToday, the Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data will be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 7:00 P. M. IST in the evening\u270c\ufe0f So a strong employment report will point to an improving US Economy and will support the US Dollar \ud83e\udd1d\n\njoin us \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/3BRtMX5ULw#NFP #XAUUSD #fx pic.twitter.com/oxROWaMwJt \u2014 Aidah Malik (@MalikAidah) March 10, 2023\n\nSilvergate bank crash wreaked havoc on BTC price, affecting other cryptos too. Notably, the bank has been battling issues with regulators over its link to FTX and Alameda Research, two firms currently bankrupting. In its statement, the crypto winter of 2022 and its contagion also affected its ability to continue operations.\n\nAs soon as the announcement went out, its shares price plummeted, and the crypto market bled. Other stocks, including SVB Financial and Silicon Valley Bank, also plummeted, causing the banking sector to lose 7.3% on March 9.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC and other cryptos are still struggling on the daily chart. BTC\u2019s price is below the $20,000 mark, ranging between $19,600-$19,700.\n\nFeatured Image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview.com"
