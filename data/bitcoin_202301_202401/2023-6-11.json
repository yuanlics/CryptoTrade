        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs raise unique legal issues. Here's what you need to know - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "While non-fungible tokens (NFTs) originally gained popularity on smart-contract platforms such as Ethereum and Solana, creators can now mint and transfer digital artifacts on the Bitcoin blockchain. But even though outwardly all those NFTs seem similar, the differences in how these digital assets are minted raise different intellectual property law issues \u2014 in particular, regarding the patent eligibility of applications related to NFTs.\n\nInvestors as well as NFT creators and buyers alike should be aware of these differences, to make sure they are protected by IP laws as well as beware of limitations, to decrease the likelihood of a potential infringer being able to avoid liability.\n\nDifferences between Bitcoin and smart-contract NFTs\n\nBitcoin NFTs are created in a much different way than NFTs on other blockchains. For example, NFTs can be inscribed into the Bitcoin blockchain as Ordinals. To inscribe an Ordinal, a user sends a transaction to a Taproot address and includes an asset/digital artifact such as a text or an image in the witness data section of the transaction. The witness data section can store up to 4 MB of data, which is generally large enough for most images and other digital artifacts.\n\nBut Ordinals aren\u2019t the only way to mint NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. Alternatively, users can mint NFTs using the STAMPS (Secure Tradeable Art Maintained Securely) protocol, which stores digital artifacts within the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) portion of the transaction. Proponents of the STAMPS protocol argue that because witness data can be pruned over time, Ordinals are not immutable.\n\nBy including an encoding of a digital artifact within the UTXO portion of the transaction, the digital artifact cannot be pruned from the Bitcoin blockchain. Also, instead of using the order in which a Satoshi was mined as a unique identifier for the digital artifact, the STAMPS protocol includes an asset identifier in the UTXO with the digital artifact. When the asset identifier is transferred to another user, the user takes ownership of the digital artifact.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe user also sends a Satoshi (1/100,000,000th of a Bitcoin) in the transaction, where each Satoshi is numbered in the order in which it was mined. For example, the first Satoshi ever mined is Ordinal number 1, the millionth Satoshi mined is ordinal number 1,000,000, and so on. The Satoshi (identified by its ordinal number) is then associated with the digital artifact so that the Ordinal number acts as a unique identifier on the Bitcoin blockchain for the digital artifact. Then when the user transfers the satoshi, the recipient becomes the owner of the digital artifact.\n\nBitcoin NFTs are also structured differently than other types of NFTs. For example, other types of NFTs are typically created with a unique token identifier and an associated set of properties, such as a name, a link to a digital image, etc. On the other hand, a user does not create a unique token identifier or a token at all when inscribing an Ordinal. Instead, the digital asset is inscribed with an existing Satoshi.\n\nArguably, the Satoshi does not have a unique token identifier, as it is originally mined as a fungible token which then takes on some non-fungible properties by being numbered in the order it was mined. Recently, developers have created a protocol using Ordinals for BRC-20 tokens, which is a reference to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 tokens. These BRC-20 tokens are fungible tokens created and transferred using Ordinals, thereby adding further confusion when determining the fungibility of a Satoshi used to inscribe fungible tokens.\n\nAlso, the Satoshi does not have off-chain metadata like an NFT on other blockchains, which includes a set of properties of the NFT. Instead, the digital artifact is directly inscribed into the witness data section (or the UTXO section in the STAMPS protocol) of a transaction.\n\nLegal ramifications of NFT differences\n\nPatents that only describe NFTs as they exist on smart-contract platforms (e.g., having a unique identifier and a set of properties that describes the digital artifact that they represent) may be vulnerable to a design around by a potential infringer that alters their software so that digital artifacts are minted and transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain instead of on Ethereum, Solana, or another smart contract platform. If the patent claims some use of NFTs, the potential infringer may argue that their digital artifacts on the Bitcoin blockchain are not NFTs since they may not have a unique token identifier, may not be represented by a non-fungible token, and/or do not have off-chain metadata.\n\nAccordingly, it is important to consider including a description of Bitcoin NFTs as well as smart contract platform NFTs in the patent description. For example, NFTs can be defined to include any digital artifact stored on a blockchain or referenced by a blockchain (in the case where a smart-contract platform NFT includes a link to the digital artifact) regardless of whether it is associated with a token or a unique token identifier.\n\nAddressing these legal ramifications in the patent description may also have some benefits later on when the United States Patent and Trademark Office determines whether to grant the patent. For example, U.S. patent law requires that patents claim eligible subject matter. In some instances, patent claims \u2014 particularly when they involve software \u2014 may fall under a judicial exception to patent eligibility, which can be very difficult to overcome. However, a claim is patent-eligible if the claim, for example, improves a technical field. By describing Bitcoin NFTs and their technical advantages, the legal team for NFT creators may have the proper ammunition for overcoming these eligibility concerns.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin NFTs improve upon smart contract platform NFTs by including the digital artifacts directly on the blockchain rather than including a reference or pointer to the digital artifacts. Because the Bitcoin blockchain is immutable, the digital artifacts stored on the Bitcoin blockchain are likely to remain on the blockchain forever unchanged. Bitcoin NFT owners do not have to worry about a centralized entity taking down or altering the digital artifacts so that they no longer have proof of ownership of the original. This also reduces the opportunity for fraud by selling an NFT that the seller claims to reference a particular digital artifact in a centralized storage or decentralized file storage system but does not actually reference the particular digital artifact. Instead, users can verify an inscription or STAMP on the public blockchain.\n\nExtra work, new advantages\n\nThe advent of the Bitcoin NFT may create some extra work for NFT creators and their lawyers to ensure that potential infringers aren\u2019t able to work around patents by launching their NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. However, with this extra work comes an increased likelihood of success at reaching allowance on patent applications that describe NFTs by being able to highlight the new technical advantages of Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nWhile NFT thieves may still have other ways to avoid liability for infringement, attorneys who specialize in blockchain intellectual property and patents should do their best to stay up-to-date with the latest in this rapidly developing and ever-evolving technology so that creators can enjoy the fullest protection under the law, no matter what the innovation.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The information contained in this article is for informational purposes only and is not legal advice or a substitute for obtaining legal advice from an attorney.

        "title": "As crypto burns, solo bitcoin miner wins BTC 'lottery' - Blockworks",
        "content": "Crypto has been swallowed by a sea of red, but one astronomically lucky bitcoin miner probably hasn\u2019t noticed.\n\nA solo bitcoin miner solved block 793,607 on Friday evening using what was likely a single Antminer S9 rig.\n\n\u201cA miner of this size would only solve a block [roughly] once every 450 years on average,\u201d tweeted the admin of mining software Solo CKPool.\n\nThe prosperous miner earned 6.175 BTC ($160,100), or 200 times the price of an Antminer S9 on Amazon.\n\nUnlike regular bitcoin mining pools \u2014 in which users combine computing resources to mine together while dividing profits \u2014 Solo CKPool is more of a software proxy for those who can\u2019t run Bitcoin Core directly.\n\nInstead of sharing profits with all the other miners, Solo CKPool will instead return 98% of bitcoin rewards to the miner (the other 2% going to the admin for upkeep).\n\nIt\u2019s perfect for tiny setups that might struggle to sync the entire Bitcoin blockchain (now nearly 500 GB), like this $400 rig powered by a Raspberry Pi and a USB mining stick.\n\nBut large mining operations can use Solo CKPool too, if they\u2019re feeling particularly fortunate.\n\nAbout 0.21% of Bitcoin\u2019s current hash rate (the total computing power on the network) is using the software right now.\n\nSolo bitcoin mining at all-time high difficulty\n\nBitcoin miners earn BTC by submitting the correct hash (a string of jumbled letters and numbers) for a particular block. This wins them the right to select and process transactions.\n\nMining rigs generate as many guesses as possible in the hope that one is accepted \u2014 more rigs mean more guesses and more chances at lucrative block rewards (and transaction fees).\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin to add blocks about once every 10 minutes on average. So, solving blocks must become more \u201cdifficult\u201d as more miners join the network. Otherwise, miners with loads of rigs would solve blocks in much less than 10 minutes.\n\nAnd there are loads of new mining rigs on the network, including newly-developed ASICs, more efficient than ever before. Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate has in turn set new records all year.\n\nThe network\u2019s \u201cdifficulty\u201d is also at an all-time high. This figure (now at 51.23 trillion) effectively determines the range of potentially correct hashes, making it less likely that miners would submit the correct ones without adding more machines.\n\nBitcoin mining has never been more competitive \u2014 or more \u201cdifficult\u201d\n\nAll this makes mining bitcoin with a single \u2014 or even a handful \u2014 of rigs really special. Over the past six months, data suggests only eight blocks have been solved by Solo CKPool miners, and fewer than 300 since 2014. That works out to be roughly 0.03% of all blocks mined across both periods.\n\nTwo blocks were amazingly solved across consecutive days last January, also believed to be by garage miners.\n\nAs for our recent winning solo miner, they seem content with holding their winnings. Blockchain data shows they\u2019ve sent the BTC to a fresh address, where it still sits.\n\nThe SoloCK admin estimated their luck amounted to one-in-5,500 chance. The odds of winning the US Mega Millions jackpot \u2014 most recently worth $240 million \u2014 is currently around one in 303 million.\n\nUpdated Jun. 12, 2023 at 10:22 am ET: Corrected percentage of SoloCK blocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Is Ron DeSantis good for crypto? Republican makes Bitcoin part of campaign - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis officially entered the United States presidential race on May 24.\n\nDuring a Twitter broadcast hosted by venture capitalist David Sacks, DeSantis pledged to lead a \u201cGreat American Comeback,\u201d provoking accusations of plagiarism from ex-president and fellow 2024 presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\nAmong topics like U.S. immigration policy and the supposed prevalence of \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d DeSantis gave significant attention to cryptocurrency during his hour-long presentation. He promised to protect \u201cthe ability to do things like Bitcoin\u201d and fight the \u201ccentral planners\u201d at Capitol Hill.\n\nRon DeSantis on #Bitcoin: \u201cI\u2019ll protect the ability to do things like bitcoin. I don\u2019t have an itch to control everything that people may be doing in this space.\u201d pic.twitter.com/j4wRHZACK5 \u2014 Jane Adams (@iLoveJaneAdams) May 25, 2023\n\nDeSantis\u2019 stance on crypto has been fairly consistent over the past few years. Still, his decision to emphasize it again is notable, as was the choice to announce his presidential bid on Twitter in the virtual presence of crypto-adjacent Elon Musk.\n\nThis has led to the characterization of DeSantis as \u201cthe choice for crypto enthusiasts in 2024,\u201d and there\u2019s little doubt the politician will keep trying to win unanimous support among the community.\n\nA friend of crypto\n\nIn 2021, the Florida governor proposed that the state government allow businesses to pay state fees with cryptocurrencies in the 2022/23 budgetary year.\n\nHe suggested providing the Florida Department of Financial Services $200,000 of financing to offer local companies the option to pay state fees via crypto, and another $500,000 to explore distributed ledger technology\u2019s potential to maintain motor vehicle records, authenticate Medicaid transactions and detect potential fraud.\n\nOverall, the governor\u2019s stance has matched general crypto enthusiasm in the state. Miami hosted the \u201clargest-ever\u201d Bitcoin event in 2021, while its mayor, Francis Suarez, started accepting his paychecks entirely in Bitcoin.\n\nMiami even introduced its own cryptocurrency, built on the Bitcoin blockchain, dubbed MiamiCoin. Within the MiamiCoin protocol, 30% of all coins mined made their way to a digital wallet designated for the city.\n\nIn 2023, DeSantis started engaging in political discussions around crypto more seriously. In March, he held a press conference under the banner \u201cBig Brother\u2019s Digital Dollar,\u201d where he spoke out against the Federal Reserve\u2019s possible plan to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Noting recent inflation rates and the Fed raising interest rates, the politician concentrated on freedom and privacy concerns tied to the \u201cdigital dollar:\u201d\n\n\u201c[A CBDC] provides the government with a direct view of all consumer activities. Any way they can get into society to exercise their agenda, they will do it. So, what the central bank digital currency is all about is surveilling Americans and controlling the behavior of Americans.\u201d\n\nConcluding the press conference, DeSantis urged Florida lawmakers and their \u201clike-minded\u201d counterparts from other states to introduce legislation prohibiting modifications to the Uniform Commercial Code so no U.S. or foreign CBDC could be included.\n\nMagazine: AI Eye: Is AI a nuke-level threat? Why AI fields all advance at once, dumb pic puns\n\nPlaying on recent tensions with China, he mentioned the country\u2019s digital yuan project, which he claimed is being used \u201cto monitor citizen behavior allowing for the surveillance of spending habits and to cut off access to goods and services.\u201d\n\nHe later repeated this rhetoric in response to the Fed\u2019s public claim that it would seek Congress\u2019s support if it decided to introduce a CBDC. DeSantis said that it is not a question of benevolent intentions but a constitutional requirement for that kind of major policy change to be authorized by Congress. \u201cUnaccountable institutions cannot impose a CBDC on Americans,\u201d he added.\n\nIt is not merely \u201cideal\u201d that major changes in policy receive specific authorization from Congress; it is constitutionally required.\n\n\n\nUnaccountable institutions cannot impose a CBDC on Americans. They will tell us that CBDC won\u2019t be abused but we are wise enough to know better.\u2026 https://t.co/OqJ27Lym2L \u2014 Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) April 10, 2023\n\nA couple of months after his fiery speech about the digital dollar, DeSantis signed a bill restricting the use of possible CBDCs in Florida. Were a U.S. CBDC to be issued, he warned, it would be \u201ca massive transfer of power from consumers to a central authority.\u201d The governor also claimed that a CBDC would threaten private cryptocurrencies.\n\nSuch a fierce anti-statist and pro-market position, complemented by decent knowledge of the crypto market, make DeSantis an attractive candidate for some industry enthusiasts. As J.W. Verret, an associate professor at George Mason Law School, told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cDeSantis\u2019 leadership could cultivate a more supportive environment for cryptocurrencies, potentially stimulating a wave of innovation and entrepreneurship.\u201d\n\nHowever, the problem may lie in other areas of DeSantis\u2019 political advocacy unrelated to cryptocurrency.\n\nA foe of progressives\n\n\u201cThe most likely Trump alternative in the race,\u201d as the pundits often call him, DeSantis combines the stature of a successful governor of a large state with a conservative public persona.\n\nDuring his tenure in the U.S. Congress, DeSantis fought climate tax hikes, the Affordable Care Act, gun control, Barack Obama\u2019s immigration policy, the special prosecutor Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of interference in the 2016 presidential election and taxes on social security benefits. He was one of the founders of the conservative-libertarian congressional Freedom Caucus in 2015.\n\nAs governor, DeSantis shifted Florida\u2019s Supreme Court balance to originalism, making it more likely the court would not impede his struggle against major social change. He also imposed stricter rules on Florida universities when collaborating with China and signed an \u201canti-sanctuary city\u201d bill, preventing so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d from being established in Florida. But perhaps the most contentious of the governor\u2019s political activities is his battle with \u201ccritical race theory\u201d and LGBTQ+ awareness in schools.\n\n\u201cFlorida is where the woke goes to die,\u201d he proclaimed during his second-term speech.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, the Florida Board of Education approved a ban on teaching critical race theory in school, which DeSantis endorsed, while in December of the same year, a politician introduced his Stop Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees Act or the Stop WOKE Act.\n\nThe legislation was signed into law in 2022 but was partially injuncted by district judge Mark Walker, who declared it too vague and unconstitutional. However, DeSantis still managed to ban transgender girls from participating in female school sports competitions, and prohibited discussions on gender identity in school classrooms from kindergarten to third grade.\n\nThese efforts have been popular with conservative voters but have not come without consequences.\n\nHe eliminated Disney World\u2019s special tax district in Florida in response to the media giant\u2019s vocal opposition to his conservative stance on LGBTQ+ issues. Disney subsequently halted plans for a $1 billion development project in the state, which it claims would have created some 2,000 jobs.\n\nFurthermore, Republicans fell far short of expectations in the 2022 mid-term elections, with American voters failing to rally around the party in the numbers expected by many, and some analysts believe that the rhetoric of many party members that concentrated on culture-war issues and claims of a stolen election may have had an impact.\n\nAll this, combined with the fact that DeSantis is currently polling well behind former president Trump could spell headwinds for the pro-crypto governor.\n\nVoting in the era of polarization\n\nDeSantis represents a combination of a pro-free market, low taxes, low welfare economic vision and a populist appetite for cultural wars with progressives, which has become increasingly prevalent in the last decade.\n\nIn this context, his support for crypto is manifested more as a part of a larger anti-statist and business-friendly paradigm, rather than a detailed stance on cryptocurrency specifically \u2014 one could hardly recall any nuanced points from DeSantis about the potential of decentralized finance (DeFi), for example.\n\nThus, betting on him could widen a notable separation in the U.S. crypto community, with some feeling threatened by the Biden administration\u2019s hawkish crypto stance, in contrast to the relatively pro-crypto rhetoric in the Republican Party, leading to a growing partisan divide.\n\nIs it productive for the crypto industry to foster stronger ties with the Republican Party in the long run?\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of the Pastel Network \u2014 a decentralized blockchain for nonfungible tokens \u2014 said in an era of extreme polarization, the answer depends on where one falls on the political spectrum.\n\nThat said, the recent approach of regulation-by-enforcement from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 the head of which was appointed by a Democratic president \u2014 has been deeply unsettling for market stakeholders, up to the point of an \u201cexistential risk\u201d anxiety:\n\n\u201cSo I imagine that some in our industry would be willing to compromise on their candidate of choice, to some extent at least, because of the related policy stance on crypto. This would also apply to any number of industries, I should add, not just crypto.\u201d\n\nThe CEO and co-founder of carbon-backed digital collectibles Ecosapiens, Nihar Neelakanti, believes that the current situation is merely a projection of a general political polarization in the U.S., where the crypto industry \u2014 neutral in basics and uniting a broad spectrum of supporters, from liberals to libertarians \u2014 seeks any kind of support it can get. And DeSantis still doesn\u2019t represent the only candidate who could accumulate crypto voters.\n\nNeekalanti told Cointelegraph, \u201cThe good thing is that we now have candidates from both major parties who are supportive of Bitcoin and crypto more generally. If a pro-Bitcoin conservative wins, then there will be many who say this is bad for crypto. But if a pro-Bitcoin liberal wins, many will also say this is bad for crypto. We\u2019re just too politically divided as a nation.\u201d\n\nDan Nissanoff, the CEO and founder of Game of Silks metaverse, agrees. Speaking to Cointelegraph, he highlighted that the crypto community is still very far from uniting around any single candidate.\n\nAt least three candidates appear to have embraced the digital asset economy wholeheartedly: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy. \u201cDeSantis is popular among conservatives, just as RFK Jr. is popular among a seemingly growing number of liberals. It\u2019s nice to see glimmers of bipartisan support for digital assets.\u201d\n\nRecent: Economics of Bitcoin ATM market could hinder wider adoption\n\nThe only sure thing at this point is that Biden is likely to be the least popular candidate for crypto enthusiasts.\n\nThe optimal choice for someone in the crypto community might come down to two factors, Georgieades explained:\n\n\u201cThe first is whether any particular candidate is pro-crypto or not. And, second, how this candidate approaches other hot-button issues facing the country.\u201d"

        "title": "Bhutan puts Bitcoin mining plan in motion to power up economy - Nikkei Asia",
        "content": "THIMPHU -- The tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, known for its Gross National Happiness development indicator, is embarking on a cryptocurrency mining project as it aspires to build a 21st-century economy.\n\nThe country has teamed up with Nasdaq-listed Bitdeer Technologies Group, based in Singapore, to develop a 600 megawatt mining farm for Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency. Bitdeer was due to establish a closed-end fund at the end of May, aimed at raising $500 million from international investors for the project. A high-level source close to the project confirmed that the fundraising drive indeed began as planned.\n\n\"While Bhutan faces geographical constraints and connectivity challenges, being landlocked and mountainous, its green and relatively cheaper power provides an opportunity to invest in digital assets to build a more connected and sustainable economy,\" said Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), the government investment arm that is partnering with Bitdeer.\n\n\"In doing so, it will deepen local knowledge and engagement in the rapidly evolving technology landscape and equip citizens to participate in the modern global economy from within Bhutan.\"\n\nThe move into crypto mining, a notoriously volatile and controversial industry, comes as the country is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, which shrank the economy by 10% in 2020. Foreign currency reserves have declined, nonperforming loans in the manufacturing and tourism sectors have increased and youth unemployment reached 29% last year.\n\nThis has cast a shadow over Bhutan's \"development success story,\" in the words of the World Bank, with an estimated 12.4% of the population of around 786,000 living below the national poverty line last year, up from 8.2% in 2017, according to government surveys.\n\nGrowth is forecast at 4.6% this year. But tourism, the country's second-largest revenue earner, is not expected to reach pre-pandemic levels until 2025 because of new regulations and a slow recovery in global travel.\n\nThe government hopes to diversify, on the way to building a high-income economy in the next decade. It is looking at opportunities not only in blockchain-based currencies but also fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics and biotechnology. The education system is also being reformed to emphasize critical thinking, creativity and digital literacy, with coding lessons for students aged 8 and up.\n\nFor crypto miners, Bhutan's green and relatively low-cost energy supply, mainly from hydropower, makes it an attractive destination.\n\n\"We are excited to be working alongside DHI in accessing Bhutan's zero-emissions power to sustainably enable the blockchain technologies that will eventually form an immutable bedrock for a global store of value,\" said Jihan Wu, chairman of Bitdeer Technologies Group, in a media release earlier in May.\n\nMining operations accounting for the first 100 MW are expected to begin this September, before reaching 600 MW in the next three years. Power will be sold to the operator at a negotiated rate.\n\nAt 100 MW, the project would be country's single largest energy consumer, while at 600 MW it would use more energy than the rest of the nation combined. Bhutan's peak demand was recorded at around 488 MW in December 2021, according to records with the Bhutan Power Corporation.\n\nFarm produce for sale along the Thimphu-Paro highway: More than 50% of the Bhutanese population is engaged in agriculture. (Photo by Phuntsho Wangdi)\n\nBhutan has an installed capacity of about 2,400 MW and sells most of its river hydro generation to India in the summer. In winter, it imports electricity when generation dwindles to about 414 MW. But the consistent supply is set to increase once a new 118 MW power plant comes online later this year, and a 1,020 MW facility opens in October 2024.\n\nFor now, the seasonal variation in power generation has been considered in the Bitdeer agreement, with domestic requirements to receive first priority and operations to shut in winter when generation dips.\n\nAlthough Bhutan's equity in the project will be small, the arrangement promises to create a source of dollars from the sale of power, taxes and profit-sharing. The plan is to use the funds to further strengthen the electric grid and telecom network.\n\nThe project is also expected to create between 300 to 400 jobs for Bhutanese and open up a \"whole new vertical within which we can set up resource centers to look more closely at blockchain and asset design, and communicate with our university to build R&D projects,\" said DHI's Dahal.\n\nThe excitement, however, comes with some trepidation over using national resources to enter an unpredictable industry that few truly understand. Other countries that have jumped into crypto mining have run into problems. In the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, a sudden boom in crypto mining strained the power grid, leading to localized blackouts and contributing to the protests that rocked the country in January 2022.\n\nSome countries, including former industry leader China, have banned mining because of the vast amounts of energy needed to sustain the operations.\n\nThen there is the volatility of the currencies to consider. In 2021, the value of Bitcoin crashed from $68,000 to $17,000. This year it was back above $30,000 at one point.\n\nIn April, Bhutan's DHI itself came under fire when the bankruptcy of BlockFi, a crypto trading platform, revealed that it had been secretly investing and trading in digital assets. Dahal acknowledged that Bhutan had entered the market when Bitcoin was trading at around $5,000 in 2019.\n\nThe 17th-century Tashichho Dzong in the Thimphu valley is the seat of Bhutan's central government, which aims to create a high-income economy in the next decade. (Photo by Phuntsho Wangdi)\n\nDahal insisted that DHI is aware of the pitfalls. \"We have a robust risk framework in place, and we need to take care of what is under our control, which is to operate the mine as efficiently as possible,\" he said. \"And with Bitdeer as our partner, we are confident of being able to do that well.\"\n\nMany in Bhutan view Bitcoin mining as a risk worth taking, since the currency's finite supply makes it a rare commodity -- and therefore desirable, at least in theory. Of the 21 million possible Bitcoins, more than 19 million have already been mined, a fact expected to pump up demand for the remainder. Many are also counting on cryptocurrencies becoming mainstream.\n\n\"When it comes to crypto mining, Bhutan should get into it,\" said Tshering Cigay, the former CEO of the Thimphu Techpark, an IT development hub. He said that during his tenure, Techpark received several international proposals for setting up mining farms.\n\n\"Bhutan should take advantage of its competitive edge and diversify its energy market,\" Cigay said, although he cautioned, \"When it comes to trading, it is hard to say.\""

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies To Watch: Week of June 12 - Investopedia",
        "content": "Keep an Eye on These Coins\n\nThe crypto market took a huge hit last week, largely due to the lawsuits that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed against crypto giants Binance and Coinbase. This caused the market to lose billions in market cap, and it\u2019s unclear how the events will unfold and what further impact they will have. Most coins are in the red, with a select few being only slightly affected.\n\nThis week, we examine PAX Gold (PAXG), XRP (XRP), Bitcoin (BTC), Monero (XMR), and Gnosis (GNO). In selecting these assets, we have considered several factors, including, but not limited to, positive technical developments, significant news events, and noticeable changes in price.\n\nKey Takeaways PAX Gold (PAXG) was among the least affected by recent events, with the price dropping from $1,944 to $1,924, perhaps because investors wanted the relative safety of a gold-backed cryptocurrency.\n\nXRP saw a marginal drop from $0.53 to $0.52, most likely because it is gaining the upper hand in its legal battle with the SEC.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) dropped from $26,760 to $25,959, a relatively small drop that is likely due to the fact that Bitcoin does well during rough market periods.\n\nMonero (XMR) also saw a small drop from $145.96 to $139, perhaps because it shares the same appeal to investors during market turbulence, though it relates to privacy benefits.\n\nGnosis (GNO) experienced a tiny slip from $115.30 to $110, maybe because it was protected by the fact that a new project expanded its token issuance to its network.\n\n\n\nPAX Gold (PAXG)\n\nPAX Gold (PAXG) is a cryptocurrency backed by gold and was created by those behind Paxos Standard. PAXG may be seeing less of an impact from the effects of the SEC\u2019s lawsuits because it is a token that aims to make gold easier to trade.\n\nGold is often used as a reserve asset during volatile periods, and this may be working to its benefit. PAXG is trading at around $1,924, having been priced at $1,944 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nPAXG Price: TradingView\n\nXRP (XRP)\n\nRipple Lab's XRP, is actually doing well in this volatile time because it won the motion to unseal the Hinman documents in its case against the SEC.\n\nThe documents in question contain statements made by former SEC member Bill Hinman, who stated that Ether was not a security. XRP is currently changing hands at around $0.52, having traded at $0.53 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nXRP Price: TradingView\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was one of the strongest currencies in the market this week. When investors move out of altcoins during a bearish period, they tend to put their funds into stablecoins or Bitcoin. This is possibly why the market\u2019s most popular asset saw a relatively small decline.\n\nBTC is currently priced at around $25,985, having been valued at $26,760 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nBTC Price: TradingView\n\nMonero (XMR)\n\nMonero (XMR) is similar to Bitcoin in that it has a strong community that backs it during troubling periods. Specifically, ardent crypto enthusiasts appreciate Monero\u2019s high level of privacy.\n\nThe crypto community utilizes crypto assets like XMR at a time when the market is rough, and it seems like there may be regulatory pressure. XMR is trading at around $139.00, having started last week at $145.96 (see chart below).\n\n\n\nXMR Price: TradingView\n\nGnosis (GNO)\n\nGnosis (GNO) is something of a surprise entrant on this list, given that it has not performed as well as some other tokens in recent weeks. However, it may be staving off the effects of volatility. This is due to the fact that real-world tokenization project Backed Finance announced its intention to expand its native token issuance to the Gnosis Chain.\n\nGNO is trading at around $109.80, having been priced at $115.30 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nGNO Price: TradingView\n\nAs of the date this article was written, the author does not own any of the assets discussed here.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "content": "Bitcoin inched up but continued to trade below US$26,000 on Monday afternoon in Asia, while all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, as investors brace for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) clampdown on cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nSee related article: Hong Kong legislator encourages Coinbase to set up shop in city under new crypto rules\n\nCryptos trade mixed\n\nBitcoin rose 0.21% to US$25,812 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost 3.82% in the last seven days following the U.S. SEC\u2019s lawsuits against two of the biggest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase.\n\nEther, the second biggest cryptocurrency, fell 0.97% to US$1,736, after losing 7.31% over the past week.\n\nBNB, the native token of world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange Binance, was the biggest loser in the last 24 hours, dropping 5.5% to US$224, and losing 25.59% on the week. Last week, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance, its U.S. branch, and Zhao with charges related to securities violations. Binance faces 13 charges in the lawsuit, including the unregistered offer and sale of the BNB and BUSD tokens and unregistered activity related to its Simple Earn and BNB Vault products and its staking program.\n\n\u201cThe SEC appears to have given no consideration to the drastic and cascading negative impact its actions may have on users and the industry,\u201d a Binance spokesperson said last week. \u201cWe now join a number of other crypto projects facing similarly misguided actions from the SEC and we will vigorously defend our business and the industry.\u201d\n\nThe SEC has also sued Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., on similar charges.\n\n\u201cWe are in this environment of regulation by enforcement. I don\u2019t feel like there is a clear rulebook. The only high-level statement they have made is that everything other than Bitcoin is a security, [and] that\u2019s just not what it says in the law, and by the way, that would also kind of mean like the end of the crypto industry in the U.S\u2026we have to go to court to challenge that and we are proud to do it for the industry and for America,\u201d Coinbase\u2019s co-founder and chief executive Brian Armstrong told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA and Polygon\u2019s Matic were the biggest gainers in the last 24 hours. Cardano rose 6.11% to US$0.2788, although it lost 25.72% on the week. Polygon increased 4.59% to US$0.6292 but declined 29.13% in the last seven days.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 0.25% to US$1.05 trillion and the total market volume fell 21.12% to US$27.29 billion in the last 24 hours.\n\nNFT sales on Bitcoin network surge\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.71% to 2,999.94 in the 24 hours to 6.40 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 9.16%.\n\nThe Forkast ETH NFT Composite lost 1.34% to 1,056.57 and declined 5.19% on the week.\n\nEthereum NFT sales dropped 11.75% to US$13.04 million in 24 hours, according to CryptoSlam data. Bored Ape Yacht Club recorded the highest sales volume among NFTs in the Ethereum blockchain, rising 3.57% to US$1.46 million in 24 hours.\n\n\u201cThis has been an extremely rough week for crypto and NFTs due to the U.S. SEC filing lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase,\u201d according to Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. \u201cDuring this new phase of scrutiny on, well, everything on the blockchain, the NFT community has really banded together to support the builders.\u201d\n\nNFT sales on the Bitcoin network gained 42.14% to US$6.73 million. The Derps gained the most sales volume among NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain, climbing 52.67% to US$4.61 million in 24 hours.\n\n\u201cBitcoin still holds onto number two and seems to be on auto-pilot. More traders are being onboarded into the Ordinals ecosystem as the appeal of taking part in the early days of the historic chain\u2019s NFT scene becomes too big to miss,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nAsian, European markets gain; U.S. futures rise\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nAsian equity markets mostly gained on Monday as investors await policy decisions this week from major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite dropped 0.08% and the Shenzhen Component Index rose 0.74%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index gained 0.07% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 strengthened 0.52%.\n\nU.S. stock futures rose as of 7.30 p.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 0.09% and S&P 500 futures rose 0.28%. Nasdaq 100 Futures also gained 0.52%.\n\nThe U.S. is scheduled to release its latest consumer price index (CPI) data on Tuesday, a key inflation indicator. Annual inflation in the world\u2019s biggest economy is expected to fall to 4.1% in May, from 4.9% in April and 5% in March, mainly due to lower energy prices, according to Trading Economics.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is expected to hold any increase in interest rates at its next meeting on June 13 and 14. Current interest rates in the U.S. are between 5% and 5.25%, the highest since 2006, after 10 consecutive hikes that started in March 2022.\n\nEuropean bourses also strengthened on Monday. The benchmark STOXX 600 rose 0.31% and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 gained 0.73%.\n\nThe European Central Bank is expected to raise its key interest rates by 25 basis points on June 15 and again in July, due to lingering inflation, according to a poll of 59 economists by Reuters.\n\n\u201cFixed income investors have experienced a period of very low interest rates over the past decade. Going forward, we are likely to see higher interest rates kept in place by central banks to control lingering inflation. In this new environment, corporate bonds can play a useful role in portfolios because different types of credit can be used at different stages of the economic cycle,\u201d Elizabeth Murphy, investment director of credit at Schroders, said in a note on Monday."

        "title": "Coinbase is the latest target of the SEC\u2019s crypto crackdown\u2014how U.S. investors may be affected - CNBC",
        "content": "The U.S. federal government is pursuing a case against one of the most popular cryptocurrency trading platforms. On June 6, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase, the second-largest crypto exchange by volume, according to CoinMarketCap.com. The federal regulator alleges Coinbase operated its crypto asset trading platform as an unregistered national securities exchange and broker, per the June 6 press release. The SEC also alleges at least 13 crypto assets that Coinbase made available to customers, including Solana and Cardano's tokens, qualify as \"crypto asset securities,\" according to the complaint. Coinbase's staking program, which the regulator describes as a way for crypto investors \"to earn financial returns through Coinbase's managerial efforts,\" counts as an investment contract and unregistered security, the SEC says. In a tweet following the SEC's announcement, Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong said, in part, \"Regarding the SEC complaint against us today, we're proud to represent the industry in court to finally get some clarity around crypto rules.\" \"The SEC's reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America's economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance,\" Coinbase's chief legal officer and general counsel Paul Grewal said in a statement to CNBC Make It. \"In the meantime, we'll continue to operate our business as usual.\" This comes just one day after the SEC sued Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, and its billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao. On June 5, the agency filed 13 charges against them both, which included allegations that Zhao and his exchange worked to \"secretly allow high-value U.S. customers\" to continue trading on its unregulated international exchange despite publicly claiming that U.S. customers were restricted from doing so, according to the June 5 press release. Zhao has dismissed the charges on Twitter.\n\nWhat the SEC's crackdown on crypto may mean for investors\n\n\"The harsh messaging coming from the agency and its Chair Gary Gensler is a sign the SEC may be doing exactly what many in the industry have believed: shut down crypto in the U.S.,\" Chen Arad, co-founder and chief experience officer of Solidus Labs, a company that provides tools to help crypto exchanges and institutions prevent market manipulation, tells CNBC Make It. The U.S. remains a core market for crypto firms. About 20% of Americans say they've invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, per a January NBC News poll, and around 42% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 say they've dabbled in crypto trading. Still, platforms may prefer to avoid the potential regulatory risks involved in operating here and shift their focus to countries with clearer legal requirements, Arad says. Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and author of \"Re-Architecting Trust: The Curse of History and the Crypto Cure for Money, Markets, and Platforms,\" agrees. Some crypto firms may choose limit which services they offer to U.S. customers due to the complicated regulatory framework, he tells CNBC Make It. \"That's bad for U.S. investors,\" he says. \"It means that they'll have less options and are probably going to have to pay higher fees.\" Malekan owns Coinbase stock and is a longtime Coinbase customer. There is a potential upside to the SEC's latest enforcement action against crypto exchanges. Now that the lawsuits have been filed, the platforms can respond to the allegations in an open court and the public will be able to listen in, Arad says. But don't expect crypto traders to make a mass exodus from various exchanges any time soon, Malekan says. \"The people who are going to stay away or leave already have,\" he says. \"Those who are still left and investing and using services like Coinbase are probably OK with the risks that are involved.\" Although the ongoing regulatory dynamic in the U.S. can have some effect on demand, the people who want to buy crypto will continue to find ways to do so, Arad says, and using established crypto exchanges that are regulated in the U.S. is still one of the best and safest ways.\n\nDoes the suit affect bitcoin specifically?\n\nBitcoin, one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies, wasn't named in the SEC's complaint. Bitcoin has been determined to be a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act, which means, typically, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates it, according to the agency's website. There's a general understanding within the industry that if you're just trading bitcoin, you're probably OK, Malekan says. Cryptocurrency prices briefly rose following the SEC's announcement. On June 6, bitcoin prices climbed to a little above $27,100, according to Coin Metrics. As of June 12 at 11:09am EST, bitcoin had fallen to around $25,800, per Coin Metrics.\n\nThe state of crypto platform regulation in the U.S.\n\nCurrently, one of the ways the SEC determines whether an asset is an investment contract and, therefore, a security, is through the \"Howey test.\" If an asset meets the following criteria, the agency considers it to be a security that may be subject to federal securities law: There is an investment of money; in a common enterprise; in which the investor expects a profit; and the profit is derived solely from the efforts of others. But crypto challenges a lot of these older regulatory precedents and may require a new framework, Malekan says. \"We don't regulate self-driving cars under the same rules that once applied to horse and buggies,\" he says. \"With new financial instruments, we should probably have new rules.\"\n\nTrading crypto on an exchange versus peer-to-peer"

        "content": "The Bitcoin network\u2019s proof-of-work consensus mechanism could become a useful means of securing a variety of proof-of-stake (PoS) smart contract blockchain protocols, thanks to efforts from a Stanford University professor.\n\nDavid Tse and his research team are driving the use of the preeminent cryptocurrency to provide added security to PoS networks. Babylon blockchain, which Tse co-founded, aims to use Bitcoin (BTC) to bolster network security and incentivize BTC holders to participate in what is ostensibly a new approach allowing the staking of Bitcoin on proof-of-stake chains.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, Tse outlined how Babylon uses the Bitcoin scripting language to connect a PoS-based slashing mechanism to the Bitcoin network. This allows for the creation of smart contracts that can set specific spending conditions:\n\n\u201cAlthough the Bitcoin scripting language is limited in its ability to express complex spending conditions, we have used advanced cryptography to translate the slashing conditions of a PoS chain into a spendable transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.\u201d\n\nTse said that Babylon\u2019s BTC staking protocol enables BTC to secure PoS chains without altering or forking the Bitcoin blockchain. This also allows BTC holders to earn rewards for contributing to the security of PoS networks by staking their BTC.\n\n\u201cOur method essentially transforms the slashing condition of a proof-of-stake chain into a spendable Bitcoin transaction. This way, the staked BTC does not need to be bridged to the PoS chain at all.\u201d\n\nThe Stanford professor added that the simplicity of the approach also maximizes the security of blockchains by avoiding potential vulnerabilities associated with cross-chain bridges. As Cointelegraph extensively reported, cross-chain hacks and exploits have been rife, leading to over $2 billion in crypto being stolen in the past year.\n\nBitcoin remains unrivaled as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and continues to operate on the original specifications set out by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nNevertheless, the ecosystem has seen renewed interest and growth with the inception of Bitcoin Ordinals, which allow users to inscribe nonfungible tokens onto individual satoshis, the smallest denomination of a unit of BTC.\n\nSimilarly, Tse believes that protocols like Babylon expand the utility of Bitcoin beyond being a simple store of value or medium of exchange by sharing Bitcoin\u2019s robust security with other chains and applications:\n\n\u201cWe aim to scale Bitcoin\u2019s security in a way similar to Ethereum\u2019s scaling efforts, effectively sharing Bitcoin\u2019s robust security with the rest of the decentralized world.\u201d\n\nThe broader cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to develop novel approaches to blockchain consensus. Proof-of-stake chains have benefitted and are quickly adopting new approaches like zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs). StarkWare co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson, who pioneered the technology, also believes that ZK-proofs could greatly benefit the proof-of-work-based Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nMagazine: Here\u2019s how Ethereum\u2019s ZK-rollups can become interoperable"

Source: Coin Metrics\n\nIncrease in mining difficulty and reduced Ordinals activity\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty, which refers to a measure of how difficult it is to find a new block in the Bitcoin blockchain network, reached an all-time high at the start of June.\n\nBitcoin difficulty adjusts periodically to ensure that new blocks are added to the blockchain approximately every 10 minutes on average. When the network\u2019s computation capacity increases, it readjusts to make mining more difficult and vice versa.\n\nThe difficulty is adjusted every 2,016 blocks, which is roughly every two weeks, and is based on the total computational power, or hash rate, of the network. The last adjustment occurred on May 31, with a 3.39% increase in total difficulty.\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty. Source: Blockchain.com\n\nThe increase in Bitcoin difficulty reduces the earnings of miners, eating into their profitability and possibly increasing their losses.\n\nMoreover, the competition among miners has increased since the last difficulty adjustment, with the network\u2019s hash rate rising to a new all-time high of 381 exahashes per second on June 11. The next difficulty adjustment due this week will likely add to the selling pressure.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals activity, which was responsible for an increase in miner revenue, declined in May, leading to reduced earnings for miners. The total fees paid for Ordinal inscriptions on Bitcoin dropped to a two-month low, with trading volumes on nonfungible token marketplaces showing a similar trend.\n\nThe seven-day average earnings of miners, according to Glassnode data, dropped from a high of $33.9 million in May to $25.8 million at the start of June.\n\nThe 7-day moving average of Bitcoin miner revenue (orange) and BTC's price (black). Source: Glassnode\n\nJune also marked the start of summer, with hot temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere putting a significant load on some mining farms due to the increased cost of electricity.\n\nIn 2022, the summer heat waves caused miners in Texas to temporarily shut down operations. Reportedly, Texas accounts for around 15% of the mining capacity in the United States.\n\nThe heat waves could worsen in 2023, leading to a downturn in the network\u2019s mining hash rate.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners have earned $50B from BTC block rewards, fees since 2010\n\nIdentifying miners\u2019 stress levels\n\nCurrently, the cost of producing Bitcoin for the existing mining hardware lies between $35,532 and $21,244. With Bitcoin\u2019s price holding above $25,000, the downtrend in Bitcoin\u2019s mining hash rate could be limited.\n\nHowever, if the situation worsens over the summer and the mining cost increases without a proportionate increase in the BTC price, the industry could fall back into capitulation mode, marked by accelerated BTC selling and a reduced network hash rate.\n\nBitcoin price chart with production cost indicator. Source: TradingView\n\nMoreover, while Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate has continued to rise, Bitcoin\u2019s hash price metric \u2014 the market value assigned per unit of hashing power \u2014 declined significantly in May, suggesting a cooldown in demand for mining hardware.\n\nAccording to an update from Hashrate Index, the \u201chashprice [PH] is back below $70.00/PH/day for the first time since mid-March\u201d after touching an average of $82.23 per PH per day in May, a 14.8% decline.\n\nIt remains to be seen how far the sell-off extends and whether or not Bitcoin Ordinals activity comes back in the meantime.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

While nation-states battle against each other, Bitcoin proponents also face an uphill battle in their campaign for the adoption of decentralized financial tools:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the battle for decentralization with Bitcoin will be any different. I think there will be parallels to it; we can probably look at the reformation and the very shaky compromises which led to religious wars and civil strife.\u201d\n\nDale hopes to see Bitcoin become part of a new-age, peaceful monetary revolution, taking inspiration from the Czech Republic\u2019s fight against nazism and communism in the past.\n\n\u201cIt was a velvet revolution here in Prague that showed us just how peacefully we can throw off a seemingly entrenched and corrupt system like fiat or communism.\u201d\n\nRegulation of the cryptocurrency space has been a major talking point across Europe over the past two years, with the European Union taking steps to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework for the industry.\n\nThe Markets in Crypto-Assets bill is set to come into effect in 2024, introducing a host of requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges and ecosystem participants to use and trade cryptocurrencies on the continent.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin is on a collision course with \u2018Net Zero\u2019 promises"

The negative pressure came from a handful of altcoins that plunged over 15%, including BNB (BNB), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC) and Polkadot (DOT).\n\nTotal crypto market cap in USD, 1-day. Source: TradingView\n\nNotice that the downtrend initiated in mid-April has tested the support level in multiple instances, indicating that an eventual break to the upside would require extra effort from the bulls.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission tagged multiple altcoins as securities in separate lawsuits filed last week against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.\n\nDespite the worsening crypto regulatory environment, two derivatives metrics indicate that bulls are not yet throwing in the towel but will likely have a hard time breaking the bearish price formation to the upside.\n\nCrypto exchanges are under severe constraints in the U.S.\n\nBinance.US announced on June 9 the upcoming suspension of U.S. dollar deposits and withdrawal channels, besides delisting USD trading pairs. The exchange added that it plans to transition to a crypto-only exchange but maintains a 1:1 ratio for customer assets. The SEC issued an emergency order on June 6 to freeze the assets of Binance.US.\n\nAlso on June 9, the Crypto.com exchange announced it would no longer service institutional clients in the United States.

In a June 9 post via his personal blog, Buterin explained that the success of Ethereum depends on layer-2 scaling, wallet security and privacy-preserving features.\n\nDerivatives markets show balanced leverage demand\n\nPerpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours.\n\nA positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. Still, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.\n\nPerpetual futures accumulated 7-day funding rate on June 11. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe seven-day funding rate for BTC and ETH was neutral, indicating balanced demand from leveraged longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) using perpetual futures contracts. Curiously, BNB, SOL and ADA displayed no excessive short demand after a 15% or higher weekly price decline.\n\nTether demand in Asia shows modest resilience\n\nThe Tether (USDT) premium is a good gauge of China-based crypto retail trader demand. It measures the difference between China-based peer-to-peer trades and the United States dollar.\n\nExcessive buying demand tends to pressure the indicator above fair value at 100%, and during bearish markets, Tether\u2019s market offer is flooded, causing a 2% or higher discount.\n\nTether (USDT) peer-to-peer vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKX\n\nCurrently, the Tether premium on OKX stands at 99.8%, indicating a balanced demand from retail investors. Consequently, the indicator shows resilience considering the cryptocurrency markets dropped 17.7% over the last eight weeks to $1.06 trillion from $1.29 trillion.\n\nRelated: Democrats\u2019 \u2018war on crypto\u2019 will lose its key voters, Winklevoss twins\n\nGiven the balanced demand according to the funding rate and stablecoin markets, bulls should be more than satisfied, given that the recent regulatory FUD was unable to break the cryptocurrency market capitalization below $1 trillion.\n\nIt is unclear whether the market will be able to break from the bearish trend. Moreover, there is no apparent rationale for bulls to jump the gun and place bets on a V-shaped recovery, given the uncertainty in the regulatory environment. Ultimately, bears are in a comfortable place despite the resilience in derivatives and stablecoin metrics.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "History revisited: US DOJ unseals Mt. Gox cybercrime charges - Sophos",
        "content": "Remember Mt. Gox?\n\nOriginally, it was a card-trading site called MTGOX, short for Magic The Gathering Online Exchange (there was no sense of \u201cMountain\u201d in the name at all), but the domain changed hands and purpose in the early days of cryptocurrency.\n\nOperated out of Japan by French expatriate Mark Karpel\u00e8s, Mt. Gox rapidly became the biggest online Bitcoin exchange, but imploded in 2014 when the company was forced to admit that it had lost Bitcoins worth more than $0.5 billion at the time (they\u2019d be worth more than 25 times as much today).\n\nAs we wrote back then:\n\nIn 2014, the Big Daddy of Bitcoin exchanges, Japan-based Mt. Gox, made a \u201cSo sorry, they seem to have vanished\u201d announcement about a whopping 650,000 Bitcoins, worth approximately $800 each at the time. The mystery of the missing BTCs was at first blamed on a cryptographic flaw in the Bitcoin protocol that Mt. Gox\u2019s coders hadn\u2019t defended against properly \u2013 something they really ought to have done, considering that they were sitting on half-a-billion dollars worth of other people\u2019s assets. But that story didn\u2019t wash with everyone, not least those who thought that any abuse of the flaw concerned (it\u2019s euphemistically known as transaction malleability if you would like to look it up) ought to have been visible, albeit too late, in the transaction record. Some people suspected Mt. Gox insiders of simply taking the missing Bitcoins (or some of them, anyway) for themselves. Ironically, the very sort of incautious attitude to coding that would make a transaction malleability exploit possible would probably also make it possible for rogue insiders to get away unnoticed with large-scale Bitcoin larceny. That\u2019s where the story sat throughout the second half of 2014: something bad happened, but no-one quite knew whom to blame.\n\nBut on New Year\u2019s Day 2015, as we noted in that report, Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun published a dramatic article in which it openly stated that there was \u201cstrong suspicion\u201d that most of the missing Bitcoins were ripped off from inside.\n\nThe paper suggested that although the loss of BTC 7000 could be explained by cyberattack (in other words, that crooks outside the company\u2019s network were the perpetrators), there was no evidence of cyberattack in repsect of the remaining BTC 643,000.\n\nIn short, the reporters at Yomiuri Shimbun were as good as saying, 99% of the crime was an inside job.\n\nKarpel\u00e8s, for his part, ultimately received a suspended prison sentence in Japan, but that was because he was found guilty of misrepresenting his financial position to potential investors, not because of the missing Bitcoins.\n\nNot Karpel\u00e8s\n\nIronically, perhaps, Karpeles now has what amounts to a partial exoneration on the matter of the many missing Bitcoins, with the US Department of Justice unsealing Mt. Gox-related charges against two named individuals:\n\nAlexey Bilyuchenko, 43, and Aleksandr Verner, 29, both Russian nationals, are charged with conspiring to launder approximately 647,000 bitcoins from their hack of Mt. Gox. [\u2026] Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly used their unauthorized access to Mt. Gox\u2019s server to fraudulently cause bitcoin to be transferred from Mt. Gox\u2019s wallets to bitcoin addresses controlled by Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators. From September 2011 through at least May 2014, Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly caused the theft of at least approximately 647,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox, representing the vast majority of the bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox\u2019s customers. Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators allegedly laundered the bulk of the bitcoins stolen through Mt. Gox principally through bitcoin addresses associated with accounts Bilyuchenko, Verner, and their co-conspirators controlled at two other online bitcoin exchanges.\n\nIn an intriguing twist, Bilyuchenko is also charged with operating one of those \u201ctwo other online Bitcoin exchanges\u201d, the notorious exchange known as BTC-e, along with a third individual named Alexander Vinnik.\n\nBTC-e ran from 2011 until July 2017, when it was busted and shut down by US law enforcment.\n\nVinnik was indicted back then by a US court on money-laundering charges, after being arrested in Greece.\n\n(Since then, Vinnik has variously been in custody in Greece; extradited to France, where he was sent to prison for money laundering; returned to Greece after his release; and then extradited to the US to face charges there.)\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s press release about these new charges, relating to a hack that now dates back more than 10 years, says simply that Bilyuchenko and Verner are \u201cRussian nationals\u201d, but not which country the two men are in right now.\n\nBut US Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey did go on the record to say:\n\nFor years, Bilyuchenko and his co-conspirators allegedly operated a digital currency exchange that enabled criminals around the world \u2013 including computer hackers, ransomware actors, narcotics rings, and corrupt public officials \u2013 to launder billions of dollars. The Department of Justice will work tirelessly to identify cyber criminals, no matter where they are. And Bilyuchenko and his co-conspirators will learn that the Department of Justice has long arms and an even longer memory for crimes that harm our communities.\n\nAs for Mt. Gox, its winding-up process is at last drawing to a close, with the final deadline for recognised corporate creditors to file verification documents recently extended until 2023-06-15, just three days from now.\n\nThough the mills of the Law grind slowly/Yet they grind exceeding small/Though with patience they stand waiting/With exactness grind they all\u2026\n\n\u2026or, at least, we can but hope they do and will.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT BTC-E (AND HOW DARK WEB CROOKS GET CAUGHT)\n\nWe talk to renowned cybersecurity author Andy Greenberg about his excellent book, Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency."

        "content": "The past 24 hours saw the majority of altcoins crash by a considerable margin and there are no signs of slowing down.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s also a clear discrepancy between the price performance of certain altcoins to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which have remained relatively resilient.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Soars\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance increased to around 46% (data from CoinGecko). This is a major difference. The metric tracks Bitcoin\u2019s share relative to that of the rest of the market and is a clear indication of the dynamic between both.\n\nWhen the BTC dominance rises, it means BTC\u2019s price is performing better than the altcoin market.\n\nNow, the major cryptocurrency is down 3.1% on the day, which is definitely not good news, but the rest of the market is performing a lot worse. This is why the dominance is increasing.\n\nAlicia Bakery CMO - A really good agency Did you like this market update?\n\nThis is all you need not to miss any price action in the raging crypto markets. Start receiving this recap, for free, every day: Invalid email address Your privacy is guranteed. Thanks for subscribing, you will get your first report in the next hours!\n\nAltcoins Suffering Tremendously\n\nCardano, Solana, Polygon, and a lot of other major altcoins are trading well in the red, as seen in the following heatmap.\n\nThe main reason behind the plummet seems to be the fact that the SEC has listed a lot of them as securities in their latest lawsuit against Coinbase. Another major trading platform \u2013 Robinhood, also announced plans to start delisting some altcoins in consideration of the above.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that those cryptocurrencies that haven\u2019t been named in the SEC\u2019s claim are performing a bit better. For instance, Ethereum\u2019s ETH is down only about 5%, while Ripple\u2019s XRP is down around 6%. This is still a lot, but it\u2019s nowhere near the 20% (and more) that coins like ADA< SOL, and MATIC, among others, lost today."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nShould a major cryptocurrency exchange operating in the U.S. stop servicing its clients due to regulatory pressures, the crypto industry will eventually find a way around, according to Blockstream CEO Adam Back.\n\n\"The system is antifragile,\" Back told Decrypt during the recent BTC Prague conference. \"Something is a problem? They'll do something else or create an economic incentive for somebody. Some other company that had a different strategy will get a large amount of users.\u201d\n\n\"It's a market and there\u2019s a demand,\" he added. \"Once an exchange shuts down or stops servicing one market, people will just move to another exchange, or move to an international exchange.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack likened the crypto market to water, noting that, \"It just flows around; there are workarounds and the market is very efficient, because there's this huge appetite to do things.\u201d\n\nLast week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched enforcement actions against Binance and Coinbase, suing both companies for allegedly operating as unregistered securities exchanges.\n\nAmid the growing pressure, Binance's US subsidiary even made the decision to suspend dollar deposits, informing customers that its banking partners were preparing to temporarily halt its fiat (USD) withdrawal channel.\n\nBitcoin traders will be fine, says Back\n\nThe Blockstream boss, however, believes that if U.S. wire transfers are restricted, Bitcoin traders will move to open bank accounts in euros or Swiss francs to start trading in a different currency.\n\n\u201cThere are some more crypto-friendly banks in Europe, in Switzerland and Gibraltar, which will even accept Tether deposits and convert between USDT and dollars or euros as a bank service,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also will typically allow you to buy and sell Bitcoin, maybe with less advanced features because they're more of a bank than an exchange.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to him, this means there are always new options, and \u201ceach problem sort of just moves things around somewhere else.\u201d\n\nBlockstream CEO Back is best known as the inventor of Hashcash, a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system used to prevent email spam that later became one of the foundational concepts behind Bitcoin mining.\n\nHe told Decrypt that Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, would probably be happy to see how the space has evolved since 2009, when the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency was launched.\n\n\u201cIt's grown a lot,\" he said. \u201cThere are different types of individuals and companies and even countries that are so effective in Bitcoin\u2013 so it now seems like it tends to surprise to the upside, as things are happening earlier than you expected.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin's Future: The Great Deception and the Real Promise - Worldline",
        "content": "This blog post follows on from my previous one Shattering the illusion: Bitcoin\u2019s limitations as a Currency.\n\nTo talk about Bitcoin\u2019s future, we have to look to the past. Flashback to 31st October 2008, at approximately 2:10 p.m. Eastern Time, (for the record, it was Halloween day) when Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym hiding a person, or team, whose identity hasn\u2019t been uncovered to this day) sent an email with the subject line \u201cBitcoin P2P e-cash paper\u201d to a mailing list of cryptographers. This mail started with the sentence \u201cI\u2019ve been working on a new electronic cash system that\u2019s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party\u201d. It then went on to provide a link to Satoshi\u2019s renowned white paper: \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash system\u201d.\n\nGiven Satoshi\u2019s email subject line, should we then consider Bitcoin as digital cash?\n\nBitcoin, contrary to its founder\u2019s statement, is definitely not cash. D.W. Birch, in his book \u201cThe Currency Cold War\u201d, provides the following reasoning:\n\n\u201cWhatever Bitcoin is, it is not cash, for the inescapable reason that cash is fungible\u2026In this context \u2013 money \u2013 it means that all tokens (bitcoins) are the same and can be substituted for one another\u2026 [which]\u2026is not true of bitcoins. They are all different. And because they are all different, their history can be tracked through the blockchain\u201d\n\nThe author refers to bitcoins and tokens while pointing out that the transactions are happening and maintained on the Bitcoin blockchain (publicly available here), and they are all different and traceable. (As a matter of fact, in another book, D.W.Birch suggests that \u201cBitcoin is better understood \u2026 as a peculiar kind of digital commodity rather than as money\u201d.)\n\nComing to physical cash, if I give you one euro (literally a physical one-euro coin), you may give another coin of one euro back to me tomorrow, and no one can tell the difference between them (and no one cares, right?). This exchange of ours remains completely anonymous, and the origin of our euro coins will remain a mystery, their origin very difficult to trace. You might argue that the same case might not apply to banknotes as they are marked with serial numbers and they might have been just withdrawn from an ATM and directly used for a transaction that finally concludes with the return of the banknotes to the bank itself. But the bare truth is that, apart from in money laundering cases, no one cares much about banknote serial numbers \u2013 moreover, there might be the case that the banknotes participate in more than one commodity transaction - thus, for the sake of our argument, the same concept is applicable.\n\nShould we then believe that Bitcoin is as anonymous as cash? According to Bitcoin.org \u201cBitcoin is designed to allow its users to send and receive payments with an acceptable level of privacy as well as any other form of money. However, Bitcoin is not anonymous and cannot offer the same level of privacy as cash.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the former IRS-Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) Special Agent Chris Janczewski , has a similar opinion \u2013 he traced Bitcoin, that had once seemed untraceable, to crack one criminal case after another\u2014 including the seizure of much of the $4.5 billion of Bitcoin stolen during the 2016 Bitfinex hack.\n\nWhile money exchange was, in fact, the intended purpose of Bitcoin as disclosed in the original white paper, this thesis has evolved over time. In 2017, a debate has erupted within the Bitcoin community over whether to prioritize its functionality as a means of payment or its characteristics as a store of value. The move to make Bitcoin more attractive to merchants and consumers did not prevail over the argument that Bitcoin should be a financial investment. The latter camp wanted Bitcoin as a store of value due to its limited supply and potential as a hedge against inflation, while the former wanted cheaper transactions and faster confirmation times. Unable to reach a consensus, the disagreement ultimately resulted in the Bitcoin hard fork of 2017 and the creation of a new cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Cash (the success of which is still a matter of ongoing discussion and debate).\n\nThere is one more point that (quite interestingly) brings Bitcoin as currency, closer to the concept of money: ownership (or wealth) distribution. According to the Bitcoin rich list (as of 26th February 2023), 9.55% of bitcoin addresses own 98.51% of all bitcoins ever mined (some of these addresses might even be owned by the same person/entity). This is an obvious (and similar to money) wealth inequality problem. But then, who said that bitcoins should be fairly distributed among its owners? Perhaps it was \u201c\u2026a monetarist desire to create fairer economies\u2026that gave rise to the advent of cryptocurrencies\u201d as Jack Parkin has written in his book \u201cMoney Code Space: Hidden Power in Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Decentralisation\u201d. Bitcoin was supposed to be distributed evenly to its contributors, to allow for equal power between its builders - this was the dream, but it hasn\u2019t worked out that way.\n\nSumming up, Bitcoin is not digitally fungible like coins, it is not as anonymous as cash and the main current usage of Bitcoin is as a speculative investment. Bitcoin, as mentioned in my previous post, has no intrinsic value and it is not backed by anything, yet there are people investing in it. There are persons or entities with enough crypto coins or tokens to cause a significant impact on its market price, the infamous Whales, either by buying or selling large amounts of it. There are much smaller ones that hold coins rather than selling them in a panic if volatility increases, commonly known as the HODLers. Bitcoin followers advise to HODL your coins despite the FUD of those outside the community. FUD means \u201cfear, uncertainty and doubt.\u201d For the curious reader, I have used some Bitcoin slang here, and I suggest following the above link, to familiarize yourself in it.\n\nBen McKenzie, one of the leading voices among crypto-sceptics out there, points out that bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) are much more:\n\n\u201c\u2026similar to unregistered, unlicensed securities; they\u2019re investments of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others\u201d\n\nIt was not supposed to be this way. Bitcoin, the first and still the most popular cryptocurrency, began its life as a techno-anarchist project to create an online version of cash, as a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from governments or central banks.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of all the turmoil created by people looking to become rich in the blink of an eye, or easily persuaded into unsafe investments, Bitcoin has, admittedly, introduced blockchain technology to the world. This is a truly ground-breaking technological innovation, that is already transforming our financial system and perhaps our society in the years to come. I could not agree more with Cornell University economics professor Eswar Prasad, author of the 2021 book \u201cThe Future of Money\u201d, when he has written in a recent New York Times article, that:\n\n\u201cThe real promise of blockchain technology, which allows for more access and transparency\u2026At this moment, we have this fantastic technology, which could lead us to a more glorious world\u201d\n\nThe opinions and ideas expressed here are my own and I would be happy to discuss them - contact me at Makis.Malioris@worldline.com"

        "title": "Best Bitcoin Wallets for 2024 - Bitcoin Australia",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency is undoubtedly coming into the mainstream. With Bitcoin\u2019s market cap alone being over USD $979 billion at the time of writing, it\u2019s hard to deny the digital currency is a legitimate asset.\n\n\n\nBut blockchain technology facilitates so much more than just an asset or a store of value. The creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, envisioned a peer-to-peer payment system where transactions of value could be made without trust or physical assets.\n\nThat being said, whether you are buying Bitcoin as a way to store value, as an investment, or a way to make anonymous payments, you will need a Bitcoin wallet. With more and more entering the market every day, bitcoin.com.au decided to take a look at the best Bitcoin wallets.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin Wallet?\n\nWallets are an essential part of a functioning cryptocurrency. They are a way for users to access and interface with the blockchain. Wallets allow users to view, buy, sell, send, and receive the cryptocurrency they own. In many cases, a wallet is exclusive to a cryptocurrency. This often means you will need one for your Bitcoin, a separate one for your Ethereum, and so on. Of course, certain apps and hardware wallets allow you to view all your wallets at once.\n\nEach wallet has its own private keys and public addresses. If you don\u2019t have access to these, you don\u2019t truly own your Bitcoin. For example, Coinbase wallets might be easy to use, but wallets on exchanges don\u2019t give you full control of your digital assets. If you buy Bitcoin on an exchange and keep it in the on-exchange wallet, and that exchange gets hacked or goes down, your Bitcoin will disappear with it. It\u2019s essential to have your keys or addresses as well as your mnemonic passphrase. With these things in your hands, you have full control of your cryptocurrency and can access it anywhere.\n\nYour private key can be seen as a password, that only you should know. It gives you access to your assets on the blockchain. Your public Bitcoin address is what you use to send and receive Bitcoins. Originally, Bitcoin users had to generate new addresses for each transaction however, today almost all wallets are an HD wallet or a Hierarchical Deterministic wallet. This is essentially a wallet that uses a hierarchical tree-like structure of private/public addresses (or keys). This addresses the issue of users having to generate new addresses each time they want to make a Bitcoin transaction.\n\nThere\u2019s a range of different wallet types that fall into different categories, some of which we will look at below. Each has its own pros and cons and the right one for you will depend on your circumstances, and what you intend to do with Bitcoin. With that said, here are the best Bitcoin wallets, depending on your needs.\n\nBest Online Wallet\n\nOnline wallets, as the name suggests, are platforms for you to store your digital assets in a completely online environment.

Staking is a process of locking up your cryptocurrency in order to help verify transactions on the blockchain. In return for locking up your cryptocurrency, you will earn rewards in the form of new tokens.\n\nExchange\n\nExodus also allows users to swap between different cryptocurrencies directly within the wallet. This makes it easy to diversify your portfolio and take advantage of price movements in different cryptocurrencies.\n\nDeFi\n\nExodus gives users access to decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. DeFi is a new financial system that is built on top of blockchain technology. DeFi applications allow users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on their cryptocurrency without the need for a third party.\n\nNFTs\n\nExodus also allows users to store, manage, and trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

They can represent anything from artwork to in-game items.\n\nSecurity\n\nExodus uses industry-leading security practices to protect your funds. Your private keys are never stored on Exodus\u2019 servers, and they are protected by a 256-bit encryption. Exodus also offers 24/7 customer support in case you need help with anything.\n\nBest Wallet for Security\n\nLedger Nano X \u2013 $250 AUD\n\nLedger Nano X is a hardware wallet that stores your Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offline, making them immune to online threats.

Known as cold storage, hardware wallets usually store your crypto in an offline reserve, making it hard for malware attacks to get through. Hardware wallets are physical devices with sophisticated security measures so they will have a price tag, but for those who are buying large amounts of Bitcoin, the price is worth the added level of security. We have mentioned the Ledger Nano, but there are a few alternatives when it comes to hardware wallets such as the Trezor and KeepKey wallets. Typically, a hardware wallet supports a huge number of cryptocurrencies, for example, the Ledger Nano supports over 1000 coins including BTC, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Ripple and Litecoin.\n\nTrezor Model T Wallet \u2013 $332 AUD\n\nThe Trezor is the main alternative to a Ledger X, and was one of the first hardware wallets to hit the market. Its updated model, the Model T, is a relatively new wallet and the latest in crypto hardware storage. Trezor is a multi-purpose, multi-digital asset security device used to secure Bitcoin transactions along with a huge range of altcoins including Ripple (XRP) and Litecoin. It is also a powerful password manager and a two-factor authentication device. The Trezor should satisfy the most serious crypto investors.\n\nBest Desktop Wallet\n\nA desktop wallet is similar to an online wallet, however, you have the wallet\u2019s software downloaded onto your computer as an application. Typically, these have good user interfaces and decent security. The best desktop wallets will allow you to export your private keys and encourage you to store your keys offline in \u201ccold storage\u201d.\n\nElectrum \u2013 Free\n\nElectrum wallet is one of the most popular open-source software wallets on the market.

Electrum\u2019s servers are decentralised which means there\u2019s no downtime. The wallet has a bunch of other technical features which make it fast and secure such as multi-signature functionality to split the permission to spend your coins between several wallets.\n\nBest Mobile Wallet\n\nA mobile wallet is similar to a desktop wallet, only it\u2019s a mobile app on your mobile device, rather than your desktop. Like all wallets, mobile wallets allow users to interface with the Bitcoin network and see the amount of Bitcoin they own.\n\nMycelium \u2013 Free\n\nMycelium was awarded the \u201cBest Mobile App\u201d award by Blockchain.info in 2014. It has \u201cWatch Only\u201d accounts, which are wallets stored without their corresponding key, so there\u2019s no chance of it being stolen. Mycelium makes it allows users to access and use Bitcoin whether it\u2019s on an iPhone or Android device. The Mycelium interface is known to be a little more complicated than other entry-level wallets but it has a range of features that experienced users of Bitcoin will appreciate.

Regardless of choice, a Bitcoin wallet is essential to buy bitcoin, store it securely and transfer it."

        "title": "Bitcoin Dips Below US$26K: Bearish Sentiment Will Continue in Q3? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the king of all cryptocurrencies is facing a downturn as the price dropped below US$26k\n\nAfter a disastrous 2022, this year was supposed to be the year of recovery for the crypto market. The combined market cap of all tokens rose above US$1 trillion for the first time in almost a year and the entire sector was pumping, entering a decisive bullish phase. However, some experts claim that the crypto market rally is over. Especially after Bitcoin failed to reach the US$30k mark.\n\nBitcoin, often referred to as the \u201cking\u201d of cryptocurrencies, holds a prominent position in the market. Its decentralized nature, limited supply, and growing adoption by institutions have established its reputation as a reliable investment. Despite occasional price volatility, Bitcoin has consistently demonstrated resilience throughout, making it an appealing choice for long-term investors seeking stability.\n\nWith a dominant market cap and a solid track record, Bitcoin continues to attract mainstream attention and financial institutions. Its position as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation remains unchallenged. However, it is essential to consider factors such as regulatory developments, market sentiment, and technological advancements that can impact Bitcoin\u2019s future trajectory.\n\nThe BTC price soared since the new year and settled around US$28,000 till last week and suddenly dropped after the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase, now valued at around US$25,800. This intricate value made the market experience a bearish chart pattern.\n\nThe BTC value declined to 3.10% in seven days. This descending chart pattern indicates that the value even falls lesser than US$23,000. Adverse macroeconomic factors, adverse central bank policies, and negative regulatory attention are the factors behind the downturn in BTC prices.\n\nAlthough each nation wants to encourage digital assets, they can\u2019t oversee the impostor activities that happening in the crypto sector. To address this concern, SEC has regulated new rules to have transparency and accountability. However, with strict regulations, the crypto coins prices are currently swinging.\n\nAs of the latest prediction by crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, Bitcoin could undergo significant fluctuations, potentially dropping over 50% or appreciating by over 30% in the coming months. It is essential to keep an eye on Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory as it can impact the overall market sentiment.\n\nThe price action has formed a series of higher lows and lower highs leading to the appearance of a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. If the technical setup plays out correctly, then traders could witness a 13.11% rally for the flagship crypto on the upside from the triangle\u2019s resistance line. However, the movement could be in either direction.\n\nAt press time, BTC was exchanging hands at US$25,802 with a Bearish bias. Rising above this level would confirm a bullish breakout toward the optimistic target of the technical chart pattern at US$28,385 but it can also drop up to US$23,652.\n\nAlthough the bullish outlook on Bitcoin hasn\u2019t yet become evident, traders can still look for signs to identify an early trend reversal. RSI (Relative Strength Index) could drop a bit lower before bouncing off the average level. AO (Awesome Oscillator) shows a drop in bullish momentum but is close to a zero-line reset. Even after the downturn, many analysts still have faith that things could improve.\n\nEven though Bitcoin is known for its ability to overcome challenges and make strong comebacks, the doubts that the investors have are more than obvious at this point. The crypto market is changing rapidly, and some enthusiasts are beginning to question whether Bitcoin is worth investing in.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "More than 400 small businesses in the Philippines accept Bitcoin payments \u2014 fintech firm - BusinessWorld Online",
        "content": "A payment fintech launched in 2021 says it is now enabling more than 400 small businesses to accept and process Bitcoin payments.\n\nPouch.ph, the fintech firm behind the first lightning wallet for the Philippines, is tapping into the country\u2019s vast pool of tiny merchants \u2014 from mom-and-pop stores to boutique hotels.\n\nPouch.ph utilizes Lightning Network built atop Bitcoin to make digital payments quicker, cheaper, and more user-friendly. This payment protocol allows customers to pay by scanning a merchant\u2019s QR code with any Bitcoin wallet. Pouch.ph then converts that Bitcoin to Pesos and sends the money directly to the merchant\u2019s bank or mobile money account, making the process easy and efficient for both parties.\n\n\u201cOne of the most significant challenges for the growth of small businesses is the availability of payment methods, with credit cards charging fees up to three percent. With the growing number of internet and smartphone users in the Philippines, Bitcoin as a payment method will allow those who do not have credit cards or even local fiat currency to make online or in-store purchases. We\u2019re helping businesses open up a vast market that was previously untapped,\u201d Pouch.ph CEO Ethan Rose said in a statement.\n\nMore than 250 local businesses in the popular tourist destination of Boracay, including convenience stores, cafes, hotels, and restaurants, have already enrolled with Pouch.ph and have been integrating Bitcoin payments into their daily operations.\n\nFor Erielyn Gaston, owner of Kasbar restaurant, accepting Bitcoin as payment allowed her to attract a wider customer base and increase sales.\n\n\u201c[Pouch.ph] has been very helpful as another mode of payment other than credit cards and e-wallets which is the usual mode of payment here [in Boracay],\u201d she said in a panel discussion during the Bitcoin Island conference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very convenient to have a payment service that\u2019s fast and easily available so that for us, in regards to increasing the revenue, it allows people to stay longer because the other alternative that is there is one of these ATMs that are not from the banks the tourists [use]. If you ever add up the fees they charge for credit card users minus the exchange rate difference, you end up paying 10% to 11% if you withdraw from these ATMs,\u201d Tindahan It Boracay Manager Marcel Selfer said.\n\nBuilding on this success, the fintech firm is actively expanding its reach beyond \u201cBoracay Bitcoin Island\u201d and has onboarded merchants in Cebu City, Dumaguete, Iloilo, and Bacolod City.\n\nIn Metro Manila, some establishments have also started accepting Bitcoin as a valid form of payment through Pouch.ph such as the night bar URBN QC in Quezon City, Draper Startup House in Makati City, and niche retailer KosneyLand located inside a mall in Mandaluyong City.\n\nAside from receiving payments, some partner merchants use Pouch.ph for payroll. With Batch Pay feature, business owners can instantly send money in batches to employees, suppliers, and other recipients, including transfers to all major banks and e-wallets. They can transfer payroll directly to a Pouch Netbank Account with no fees, or to a nominated bank account for a minimal fee. This innovative solution aims to simplify and streamline payment processes for businesses across the country.\n\nPouch.ph is also preparing to extend its Batch Pay services for over-the-counter remittances through LBC, M Lhuillier, and Palawan Pawnshop.\n\nLocals and tourists can find merchants that accept Bitcoin payments using BTCMap.org."
