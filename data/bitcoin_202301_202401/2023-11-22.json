        "content": "Bitcoin gained popularity as one of the first cryptocurrencies to enter the public domain. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that rely on blockchain encryption and lack the backing of any government\u2019s central bank. For this reason, many companies consider bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be somewhat risky to deal with.\n\nBitcoin, ethereum and other popular forms of cryptocurrency have attracted early adopters by offering rapid payments, a greater sense of privacy and the potential for a quick profit. That last point is important to note due to the general volatility of cryptocurrencies compared to the dollar. While there\u2019s a chance that owners will make a fast profit, they could lose money just as easily.\n\nCryptocurrency is appealing to investors who are willing to take major risks, but companies have been hesitant to join the trend. That\u2019s especially true of car dealerships, who have much more money to lose per transaction than the average business if cryptocurrency\u2019s value crashes.\n\nWhy Would Someone Buy a Car With Bitcoin?\n\nWhile cryptocurrency isn\u2019t popular yet among the general public, it has an extremely loyal following. Advocates of bitcoin payments point to the following as some key benefits:\n\nPayments are fast and secure\n\nLow or no transaction fees apply\n\nSensitive financial information remains private\n\nThe elimination of percentage-based transaction fees could potentially save some customers considerable money when making a purchase as large as a car. Yet while the reasons above may appeal to some, it\u2019s still relatively difficult to find dealerships that accept cryptocurrency payments."

        "title": "Nonce: What It Means and How It's Used in Blockchain - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is the Nonce?\n\nNonce, a portmanteau of \"number used only once,\" is a random number that bitcoin miners try to find in order to mine a new block in the Bitcoin blockchain and receive a block reward for their efforts. The number is a critical element to the Bitcoin blockchain running smoothly.\n\nThe practice of mining blocks helps record and verify transactions on the Bitcoin ledger and mint new bitcoins to grow the circulating supply. Bitcoin transactions are verified in batches rather than individually, giving rise to the block structure. The block height is the number of all blocks up to a given block.\n\nThe nonce ensures each block has a unique hash, a cryptographic fingerprint that serves as an identifier for the block and underpins the expansion of the blockchain. By adjusting the nonce, miners can modify hash values that in turn potentially solve mathematical problems for mining new blocks.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Bitcoin miners engage in a relentless trial-and-error process to find the correct nonce for the production of a new block, repeatedly hashing the block header with different nonce values until a hash appears that satisfies a mathematical puzzle and the network's requirements.\n\nEach nonce is used only once for a particular block, ensuring each block has a unique identifier to prevent transaction malleability.\n\nFinding valid nonces and hashing consumes significant computational power, contributing to the network's security and resistance to malicious attacks and double-spending.\n\nUnderstanding the Nonce\n\nA Bitcoin nonce is a 32-bit (or 4-byte) random number that miners attempt to figure out through computational brute force so they can generate a valid and unique hash to produce a new block in the Bitcoin blockchain. The nonce is one of the key elements in the Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm and consensus mechanism that validates and secures the Bitcoin network.\n\n\n\nIn Bitcoin mining, miners compete to solve a complex mathematical puzzle by repeatedly hashing a block header, a grouping of data in each block containing the nonce and other essential information about the previous block, the timestamp, transactions included in the new block, and the Merkle root, the hash of all hashes of all transactions in the block.\n\nHashing refers to the process of applying a cryptographic hash function to the block header. The cryptographic hash function is a mathematical operation that takes the block header data and transforms it into a unique hash value, a fixed-length hexadecimal and encrypted string of characters. The block header data is the input and the hash value is the output of the function.\n\nThis hash value serves as a cryptographic fingerprint of the block, ensuring that the block's contents remain unaltered. Miners constantly race to generate hash values that meet the Bitcoin network's mining difficulty requirements, which are programmed to increase at scheduled intervals so the blockchain remains tamper-proof and reliable.\n\n\n\nThe nonce is the only variable in the block header that miners can modify. By changing the nonce, miners can change the hash of the block and calculate different possible solutions to the mathematical puzzle needed to spin up a new block. The first miner to find a valid hash under the network's mining difficulty requirements is awarded the block reward and the right to add the new block to the blockchain.\n\nTo find a valid nonce, miners must repeatedly increment the nonce value and recalculate the hash until the resulting hash value meets the network's target difficulty. In numerical analysis and computational algorithms, incremental computation refers to a method for approximating functions or solving equations using small, consistent steps.\n\nIf the hash value exceeds the network's difficulty-adjusted target hash, the miner tries again with another randomly generated nonce. If the resulting hash value is equal to or less than the target hash, the miner has created a solution and receives the block as a reward. The block is closed, and a new block opens that includes the previous block's hash.\n\nThe target difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a valid nonce. It is adjusted periodically to maintain a consistent block generation rate.\n\n\n\nThe Nonce in Bitcoin Mining Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the nonce is used in Bitcoin mining:\n\nMiners gather transaction data and create a new block header. They initialize the nonce to a random value and start hashing the block header along with the nonce. They repeatedly increment the nonce and rehash the block header until they find a hash that meets the network's difficulty requirements. The first miner to find a valid hash broadcasts the block to the network. Other miners verify the block's validity and add it to their local copies of the blockchain.\n\nSignificance of the Nonce\n\nThe nonce maintains the integrity and security of the Bitcoin blockchain. It prevents attackers from tampering with or forging blocks, as any alteration to the block data, including the nonce, would result in a different hash value, rendering the block invalid.\n\n\n\nIt is highly unlikely that a miner will guess the nonce on the first try. Miners in a PoW system generally have to test a large number of nonce options before getting it right.\n\nThe greater the difficulty\u2014a measure of how hard it is to create a hash less than the target\u2014the longer it is likely to take to generate a solution. And because the difficulty increases, the process of finding a valid nonce is more computationally intensive and requires significant electricity and computing power over time, introducing material constraints.\n\nThis is intentional, as it helps to secure the Bitcoin network by making it computationally infeasible to manipulate the blockchain with coordinated attacks and transaction errors such as 51% attacks and double-spending.\n\nBy requiring miners to find a valid nonce and making it difficult to predict or manipulate the nonce, the PoW algorithm ensures only blocks with a valid history can be added to the blockchain and malicious actors are prevented from changing or duplicating transactions, guaranteeing the immutability of the blockchain.\n\n\n\nThe miner who successfully finds the valid nonce for a new block receives a block reward, which consists of newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees. This reward incentivizes miners to participate in the network's security and contribute to the validation of transactions.\n\nTransactions on a blockchain are aggregated into blocks from a memory pool based on the age of the transaction or the amount of fees paid. A memory pool, also known as a mempool, is a temporary data storage area that holds unconfirmed transactions before they are added to the blockchain. The mempool acts as a waiting room where transactions are queued up and prioritized based on their transaction fees.\n\nNonce and Difficulty\n\nBlock difficulty is kept at the same level across the entire Bitcoin network, meaning all miners have the same chance of figuring out the correct hash. The Bitcoin network is set up to process a specific number of blocks over a period of time and to occasionally adjust the difficulty for miners to validate the blocks.\n\nThe difficulty of finding a valid nonce is dynamically adjusted based on the overall hash rate of the network. If the network's hash rate increases, the difficulty increases, making it harder to find a valid nonce. This mechanism ensures that blocks are generated at a consistent rate, regardless of the number of miners participating.\n\n\n\nIf the number of blocks processed doesn't meet the difficulty target, the difficulty is reduced, determining how much time the process took over the limit. If the network meets it too quickly, the difficulty is increased. When the difficulty is higher, more nonces are generated because more attempts are required to solve the hash.\n\nBitcoin block 813,958, mined on Oct. 26, 2023 by AntPool, a cluster of miners known as a mining pool, had a nonce of 105,983,939. That day, AntPool had a bitcoin hashrate of 123 exa-hashes per second (or 123 quintillion hashes) and the entire Bitcoin network hashed at 428.22 exa-hashes per second (or 428.22 quintillion hashes). That means the AntPool mining pool alone generated quadrillions of numbers to find the correct nonce and winning hash, out of an exponentially many more number of trials for all mining pools combined.\n\nMining pools, rather than individuals, open most blocks because the mining difficulty is so high that a single miner is unlikely to have enough hashing power to keep up. This power is measured in the number of hashes per second. A home computer might have a hash rate of 100 mega-hashes per second (or 100 million hashes). In contrast, a mining farm full of ASIC miners, the most advanced mining technology on the market, might hash around 30 exa-hashes per second (or 30 quintillion hashes).\n\nWhat Is a Blockchain? A blockchain is a distributed ledger or database shared among nodes of a digital network, which can include computers, data centers, and mobile devices. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in a digital format. As a ledger, a blockchain maintains a secure record of transactions, as in cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin. A blockchain's innovation comes from the fidelity of a data record without the need for a trusted third-party.\n\nWhat Is the Difference Between a Nonce and a Hash? A nonce is a temporary value used in the process of generating a hash, while a hash is a permanent identifier for a block. A nonce is 32 bits long, while a hash is 256 bits long. A nonce is used only once for a particular block, while a hash is unique to the block header and cannot be reversed to obtain the original data. Nonces are used to make it difficult to generate valid hashes, which helps to secure the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nHow Much Do Miners Make From Block Rewards? The block reward for miners who successfully find a valid nonce for a block in Bitcoin consists of two components: newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees. The amount of newly minted Bitcoin in the block reward has been roughly 6.3 BTC since June 2021 and halves every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years, with the next due in April 2024. This halving mechanism is called the \"Bitcoin halving\" and is designed to gradually reduce the overall supply of Bitcoin and maintain its value. The amount of transaction fees in the block reward varies depending on the overall volume and fee rates of transactions. In recent years, transaction fees have become a significant portion of miners' income, often exceeding the value of the newly minted Bitcoin in the block reward. This is due to the increasing popularity and usage of Bitcoin, leading to a higher volume of transactions and higher transaction fees.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn Bitcoin mining, miners are constantly trying to find a nonce that will produce a hash that meets the network's difficulty requirements for spawning new blocks that validate recent transactions and issue fresh bitcoin. A hash is a unique identifier for each block in the Bitcoin blockchain and a fixed-length string of characters that is generated by applying a cryptographic hash function to a piece of data in a process known as hashing. The data that is hashed is the block header, a structured element containing information about the block. Once a valid nonce is found, it is discarded and never used again."

        "content": "Bitcoin Sender Mistakenly Overpays Record $3M in Transaction Fees\n\nA Bitcoin (BTC) sender made a costly error by paying an unprecedented $3 million in transaction fees for a single transaction. The sender intended to send 139.42 BTC, valued at around $5.1 million, but mistakenly lost 83.64 BTC in fees, leaving the recipient with only 55.77 BTC, approximately $2 million. This transaction fee sets a new record in Bitcoin's history.\n\nAccording to blockchain data from Bitinfocharts, the transaction was processed by Bitcoin miner AntPool in block 818087. While Bitcoin transactions can be expensive during busy periods, data from Bitinfocharts indicates that the average transaction fee on the Bitcoin network is currently $14.1.\n\nIn September, stablecoin issuer Paxos paid a $500,000 fee for processing a transaction worth just $2,000. Fortunately, Bitcoin miner F2Pool agreed to refund the excessive payment in that instance.\n\nWhile this is a costly mistake, Bitcoin transaction fees have been surging lately due to growing interest in Bitcoin Ordinals. Ordinals are digital assets inscribed on the smallest unit of Bitcoin, called a satoshi. The inclusion of Ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain has increased network activity, resulting in higher transaction costs.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Bitcoin Smart Contracts and Apps: Do They Even Exist? - Ledger",
        "content": "Bitcoin Smart Contracts and Apps: Do They Even Exist?\n\nBy Mohammad Musharraf\n\nBeginner\n\nSHARE\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: \u2014 Bitcoin supports smart contracts through its native language \u2018Script\u2019, enabling multiple transaction types to take place.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Script is a purposefully non-Turing complete language and this makes smart contracts on Bitcoin limited in their functionality.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Layer-2 blockchains and solutions are present for Bitcoin to improve its smart contract offerings while keeping its security intact.\n\nBitcoin is the world\u2019s first blockchain and cryptocurrency. Its primary use case is peer-to-peer payment transfers. Often Bitcoin is referred to as digital gold, with it offering a secure and decentralized way to store and manage value. This core value proposition is what led Bitcoin to become the most popular and widely used crypto network so far. And it\u2019s these same core values that many other networks have taken inspiration from while creating new use cases and innovations.\n\nTo explain, while Bitcoin was created purely to store and manage value in a decentralized manner, other networks expanded into other territories, creating ways to host decentralized applications. Decentralized apps (DApps) have taken the world by storm, and as such, there has been a push to create these types of apps that work using the most popular network, Bitcoin. However, this was not the reason Bitcoin was created, thus it\u2019s a bit more complex than many smart-contract-ready networks like Ethereum.\n\nSo how do Bitcoin\u2019s versions of smart contracts work? And what kinds of functions are available using this method?\n\nLet\u2019s explore the concept of Bitcoin smart contracts and dive into the different types of smart contracts on the Bitcoin network.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Have Smart Contracts?\n\nYes, the Bitcoin blockchain supports smart contracts. Developers can use Script, a scripting language, to write and deploy smart contracts on Bitcoin.\n\nSo, why is Bitcoin never the first thing people think when the topic of smart contracts pops up?\n\nOften, you\u2019ll hear people say Bitcoin is not \u201cTuring complete\u201d. But in fact, that\u2019s not quite true. Instead, it\u2019s all to do with something called opcodes. Or more, Bitcoin\u2019s lack of them.\n\nOpcodes are essentially small pieces of code that represent functions that can be executed on a specific network. On some blockchains, for example, Ethereum, some of these opcodes have the power to read and write the current \u201cstate\u201d of the blockchain. Then from there, you can combine many of these opcodes to create complex automated tasks triggered by a blockchain transaction. These groups of opcodes are better known as smart contracts and are responsible for countless blockchain apps and platforms.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin script doesn\u2019t contain these types of opcodes. That also means that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have a recorded current \u201cstate\u201d at any given moment. Instead, it simply records who owns what, and allows people to send and receive coins via UTXOs, with a limited choice of conditions of how that value transfer executes.\n\nSo, now you know why Bitcoin smart contracts aren\u2019t exactly what you might expect, so let\u2019s see how they work.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin Smart Contracts and How Do They Work?\n\nBitcoin smart contracts, like their counterparts on other networks, are simply pieces of code that automatically execute when some predefined conditions are met. So, you can imagine, they work in a similar way.\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s important to know that Bitcoin operates using its own computing language: Script. And script uses something like a lock and key system to execute smart contracts. The sender sets a condition or rule in order for the transaction to be processed \u2014 acting as the lock. To follow, the recipient must provide a matching \u201ckey\u201d \u2014also a piece of code in Script\u2014that fulfills the condition set by the sender.\n\nNow, what kind of conditions can be set?\n\nLet\u2019s find the answer to this by exploring the various types of smart contracts present on Bitcoin.\n\nTypes of Bitcoin Smart Contracts\n\nPay-to-public key hash scripts (P2PKH)\n\nThis is the most common type of transaction. The sender addresses Bitcoin to the receiver\u2019s public key\u2019s hash. To access the funds, the receiver must prove they own the corresponding private key.\n\nThis is like locking a box and giving the key to one person.\n\nMultisignature scripts (MultiSig)\n\nMultiSig requires more than one signature for a transaction to be valid. An example is a 2-of-3 MultiSig, which needs at least two signatures from a group of three to execute a transaction. This adds an extra layer of security and is often used by businesses.\n\nThis is like a safe that needs two or more keys turned at the same time.\n\nTime Locked Bitcoin Transactions (nLockTime and nSequence)\n\nThis allows a transaction to be created at any given time, but only be valid at a specified future date or block height. It\u2019s a way to \u2018postdate\u2019 a Bitcoin transaction and is useful for various financial agreements. It\u2019s a sort of timelock that pertains to transactions.\n\nTime-locked transactions were made possible with BIP-65 and BIP-112\u2019s introduction of new opcodes concerning the \u2018nLockTime\u2019 and nSequence fields.\n\nEssentially, these opcodes allow an entry to specify the earliest time it can be added to a block\u2014stopping the transaction from completing until a certain number of blocks, or amount of time has passed. In short, these time-locked opcodes are important, as without them the entire Lightning network could not exist!\n\nPay to Script Hash (P2SH \u2013 BIP16)\n\nInstead of locking outputs to a public key, P2SH locks them to a script\u2019s hash. The spender needs to provide the script matching the hash and satisfy its conditions. This enables complex scripts without burdening the sender with their details. P2SH came into play with the BIP-16 upgrade.\n\nFor instance, you challenge a friend with a puzzle. If they solve it, they get the bitcoins.\n\nPay-to-taproot (P2TR \u2013 BIP341)\n\nP2TR is a privacy-preserving complex script that allows multiple parties to create a signature that looks like a single one, enhancing privacy and efficiency.\n\nIt is a combination of P2PKH and P2SH with a lot more privacy. This was part of the BIP-341 proposal, popularly known as the Taproot upgrade.\n\nMiniscript\n\nMiniscript was introduced to make the complex spending conditions (that Bitcoin was already capable of) much easier for developers to use and implement. In short, it\u2019s a simple coding language that facilitates a number of functionalities. Essentially it allows your Bitcoin wallet to handle more advanced actions like requiring multiple keys for an account or having a wallet with some spending conditions that are only active after some amount of time.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t strictly a smart contract, this is one of the more flexible custody schemes miniscript offers.\n\nNow that you know about some advanced functions, let\u2019s dig into something more tangible.\n\nWhat about NFTs on Bitcoin \u2014 do they even exist in the first place?\n\nTokens and NFTs on Bitcoin\n\nThe Ordinals protocol launched on Bitcoin in January 2023, enabling \u201cOrdinal NFTs\u201d by attaching data to individual Satoshis. Each Satoshi gets a unique number through an intuitive ordering system.\n\nOrdinal NFTs reside fully on the Bitcoin blockchain without the need for a separate token. However, that means, inscribed Satoshis now compete for block space on the network, resulting in a spike in network fees.\n\nBRC-20 \u2014 a token standard for Bitcoin Ordinals \u2014 uses JSON data to facilitate various token functions. At present, the BRC-20 token standard offers three primary functions:\n\nDeploy: This function allows users to create a new BRC-20 token contract.\n\nThis function allows users to create a new BRC-20 token contract. Mint: Users can use the mint function to generate a specific amount of BRC-20 tokens.\n\nUsers can use the mint function to generate a specific amount of BRC-20 tokens. Transfer: The transfer function enables users to send a certain amount of BRC-20 tokens to another address.\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard is relatively new and young. Hence, the functionalities are limited and not entirely user-friendly.\n\nBitcoin L2s or layer-2 solutions can help Bitcoin overcome this limitation.\n\nSmart Contracts on Bitcoin Layer 2s\n\nBitcoin smart contracts have limited functionalities. However, layer-2 blockchains on Bitcoin allow developers to code more complicated smart contracts.\n\nTo better understand how they work, let\u2019s look at a few examples of Bitcoin layer 2 chains.\n\nLightning Network\n\nThe Lightning Network (LN) is a layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin, designed to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions by conducting most of the transactions off-chain. It operates using payment channels which are like private off-chain tunnels between users that facilitate payments.\n\nApart from instant payments and low fees, LN enables the creation of more complex smart contracts like Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) within \u201cLightning Apps\u201d or \u201cLApps.\u201d These contracts are programmable, most often implemented for functions such as micropayments, instant swaps, and streaming payments.\n\nThe Lightning network is also home to Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs). To clarify these contracts allow two parties to engage in a bet, using a connection to an oracle to verify real-life events. While the oracle is crucial for the settlement of these bets, it is not directly involved in the transactions that create and settle the contract. These are directly negotiated among the parties making the bet.\n\nStacks\n\nStacks is a chain that works alongside Bitcoin. It enables developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Bitcoin.\n\nThey employ \u201cProof of Transfer\u201d (PoX) \u2014 an approach to allowing the Stacks blockchain to process its transactions while leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s security.\n\nSmart Contracts on Stacks\n\nUsing Stacks, developers can create a wide range of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized social networks.\n\nIt acts as a more diverse and expansive ecosystem while maintaining the robustness and security of Bitcoin as the base layer.\n\nTwo applications of Stacks-based smart contracts on Bitcoin are:\n\nHiro Wallet: It is a non-custodial wallet enabling secure connections and transactions within the Stacks ecosystem. Bitcoin users can participate in Stacking, a reward system that distributes BTC to users for supporting the network and locking STX tokens for a specified period.\n\nBitcoin Naming Service (BNS): BNS, a decentralized name system for Bitcoin, similar to Ethereum\u2019s ENS, saw a recent surge in registrations. To own a BTC name, users have to interact with the smart BNS contract on the Stacks chain.\n\nStart using smart contracts on Bitcoin\n\nUnderstanding how Bitcoin smart contracts work is imperative to participate safely in crypto and DeFi. It\u2019s even better when a user can understand smart contract code to assess if a smart contract is safe to interact with.\n\nAnd as with using smart contracts on any blockchain, you should prioritize the security of your private keys. The best way to do that is to use Bitcoin applications through a hardware wallet like Ledger.\n\nLedger hardware wallets keep private keys offline at all times and also enable clear signing. This helps users clearly read the transaction details before they approve it.\n\nMoreover, Ledger hardware wallets offer support to Hiro Wallet by which users can pair them and start stacking STX and delegating them to trustworthy validators.\n\nNow you know everything about smart contracts on Bitcoin, you\u2019re ready to dive in. So get yourself a Ledger, connect to Ledger Live, and start exploring the Bitcoin ecosystem. The time for education is now, and accessing Bitcoin from the Ledger ecosystem is secure and easy to understand."

        "title": "Bitcoin supercycle 2024: Is this the cycle to end them all? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The conventional wisdom of the cryptoverse is that there is a boom-and-bust cycle to the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. This cycle is led by the \u201cKing of Cryptos,\u201d Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is programmatically set to have a halving cycle roughly every four years, which cuts the supply of new coins awarded to miners in half. The halving sends a supply shock to the market, and as seen in the past three cycles, this under- and overvaluation in the market is partially responsible for the dramatic ups and downs.\n\nOther factors also play critical roles in this cycle, including overall network adoption, expanded use cases for Bitcoin \u2014 like the Lightning Network for scalability and Ordinals for nonfungible tokens \u2014 and the ever-popular \u201cinstitutional adoption.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, Dan Held, a Bitcoin educator and marketing adviser for Trust Machines, predicted that Bitcoin would eventually see a \u201csupercycle,\u201d citing the increased value of the network as adoption grows (Metcalfe\u2019s law), increased scarcity due to the halving and increased institutional adoption.\n\nThis supercycle will, theoretically, see Bitcoin run up to new all-time highs, from which there will be no further downside, as there will be enough adoption and institutional support to continue to prop up the price.\n\nCrypto winter sets in at the end of 2021\n\nThis support did not occur in the last cycle, and Bitcoin fell from its all-time high of $69,000 at the end of 2021, bringing the rest of the market down with it. All those factors of reduced supply, greater network growth, and more business and institutional support were not enough to support the meteoric rise.\n\nInstitutional support was growing so much during the last leg of the cycle that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved around the world. The first physically-backed BTC ETF was launched in Canada in February 2021 by Purpose Investments.\n\nSince then, Canada has also approved the CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF and Evolve Bitcoin ETF. In Germany, there is the ETC Group Physical Bitcoin ETF, while Brazil and Australia also launched spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2021 and 2022. Yet these products did not provide the institutional support many believe will come from ETFs.\n\nHowever, the various stock markets worldwide do not compare to the United States.\n\nThe European Union makes up 11.1% of global equity markets, while Australia and Canada make up 1.5% and 2.7%, respectively. All these markets combined are dwarfed by the United States, which comprises 42.5% of all global equity markets.\n\nThis does lend some weight to the idea that this cycle may hold the promise of Held\u2019s \u201cBitcoin supercycle,\u201d as the largest country in all global equity markets may soon allow spot Bitcoin ETFs to trade.\n\nBlackRock, one of the most prominent names in asset management and investment circles, applied for its own spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2023, providing a kind of green light for other institutions to start getting involved. However, institutions are only one factor here.\n\nAdoption may be an emerging market trend\n\nAccording to Chainalysis\u2019 recent \u201c2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report,\u201d India, Nigeria and Vietnam were the top three countries for crypto adoption in 2023. The rankings were based on an index score that looked at centralized services, retail services, peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange trade volume, decentralized finance (DeFi) and retail DeFi value received.\n\nThe U.S. makes up North America\u2019s largest percentage of transaction volume, and the country ranked fourth overall. As the chart below shows, North America had the largest percentage of large institutional transfers but some of the lowest amounts of small and large retail.\n\nRecent: Former Coinbase exec posits blockchain-driven vision of future societies\n\nThis differentiation is important, as the market value of a commodity is not derived from centralized entities but rather from decentralized independent actors perceiving value in the commodity. As the Chainalysis report and Cointelegraph Research\u2019s recent \u201cInvesting in DeFi\u201d report suggest, investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is akin to emerging markets investing at this stage in the adoption cycle.\n\nParticipants, not institutions, bring value\n\nWhile institutional adoption will undoubtedly be an essential factor if and when the Bitcoin supercycle takes hold, Bitcoin itself needs to have perceived value from market participants, or it will not have the staying power. History is replete with examples of thriving industries that were superseded by a new technology the market found helpful and that toppled giants practically overnight.\n\nThe introduction of petroleum products completely overturned the whaling industry in the mid-1800s. There was a vast industry and institutions behind global whaling interests with boats, trade and infrastructure. Still, no matter how much money was behind it, the market saw better use with the new products.\n\nMore recently, and closer to the technological innovation led by the blockchain revolution, the dot-com bubble of the mid-1990s and early 2000s saw various companies overvalued. Part of the overvaluation was based on the assumption that adoption would be more rapid than what actually happened.\n\nSignals such as the internet browser Netscape seeing 3 million downloads in three months had investors excited about what the rest of the industry could do.\n\nIn 1995, Netscape had a successful initial public offering, backed by institutions like Morgan Stanley, which pushed the stock price from $14 to $28 \u2014 valuing the not-yet profitable 16-month-old company at over $1 billion.\n\nInvestors kept looking for the next Netscape among the slew of Silicon Valley companies, and money poured into the space. In economics, the very height of the boom cycle, where overvaluation is at its apex just before the bust, is called the \u201cMinsky moment.\u201d\n\nThe dot-com bubble\u2019s Minsky moment came in 2002. There was a ton of investor sentiment and institutional money flowing around, but there was no underlying adoption of many of the companies that saw investments. Nothing was ultimately there to support these companies and their value.\n\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market rose dramatically between 1995 and 2000, peaking in March 2000 at 5,048.62 before falling 76.81% to 1,139.90 in October 2002. Without customers and the actual usage of these firms\u2019 services in the market, there was nothing to keep the overvaluation afloat.\n\nWhat does this mean for Bitcoin?\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, \u201cThere\u2019s no sugarcoating it: Worldwide grassroots crypto adoption is down.\u201d However, as stated previously, lower-middle-income (LMI) countries \u2014 like India, Nigeria and Ukraine \u2014 have seen increased adoption.\n\n\u201cLMI is the only category of countries whose total grassroots adoption remains above where it was in Q3 2020, just before the most recent bull market,\u201d its report states.\n\nWhile the United States may be fourth in terms of crypto adoption, it\u2019s not driven by P2P Bitcoin transactions, as the U.S. ranked 12th in that category.\n\nRather, stablecoin trading took the lion\u2019s share of transactions, with Bitcoin generally trading less than altcoins. Bitcoin is not currently a widespread medium of exchange in America.\n\nThis is not due to Bitcoin\u2019s lack of perceived value on the market but rather the lack of necessity for Americans to use it for payments.\n\nLMI countries are seeing greater adoption due to high inflationary monetary issues within their respective countries, and Bitcoin, as much as it fluctuates, can be a better alternative than holding domestic currency.\n\nAs the world continues with the trend of dedollarization, the flight to safety could be Bitcoin.\n\nCould this happen in the United States as well?\n\nThe three major credit rating firms \u2014 Standard and Poor\u2019s (S&P), Moody\u2019s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings \u2014 have all downgraded the U.S.\u2019 credit rating.\n\nIn August 2011, S&P lowered the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+. Fitch followed suit in August 2023. And on Nov. 10, 2023, Moody\u2019s lowered its outlook on the U.S. credit rating from \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing growing deficits and decreased ability to pay back the national debt.\n\nThe drops in credit ratings signal decreasing confidence in the U.S. and, by extension, the standing of the U.S. dollar being the central unit of account for global settlement.\n\nIf hyperinflation starts to rear its head in the U.S., it is possible that alternatives will be used instead of holding onto cash.\n\nChances are it\u2019s super early in this cycle\n\nWhile Held introduced the idea of a Bitcoin supercycle, he has frequently said that people are still early in terms of getting into stacking sats. While increased institutional adoption may give Bitcoin a rise in fiat value and greater routes for investment, all the following elements must be in play for the supercycle to be in full swing:\n\nInstitutional demand: Assuming BlockRock and the other financial powerhouses are granted spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., the amount of investment from institutions, family offices, sovereign wealth funds and high-net-worth individuals could give Bitcoin support in raising the fiat value to a certain level. Galaxy Digital, for example, predicts this will bring Bitcoin up to around the $59,000 level.\n\nSupply: The next Bitcoin halving event will occur around April 2024 at block height 840,000, and 96.9% of all the existing BTC will have been mined. This means the supply part of the supercycle equation is checked. Even if grassroots demand stays the same, this would indicate a higher fiat price. Still, as was seen in previous cycles, a price increase (\u201cnumber-go-up\u201d technology) will likely increase demand, at least in the short term, due to fear of missing out.\n\nAdoption: While some may buy Bitcoin for \u201cnumber-go-up\u201d reasons, its actual use will give it a long-term value proposition. It is yet unknown whether America\u2019s economic and sociopolitical climate will nudge people to adopt Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, a store of wealth or a hedge against further dollar inflationary pressure.\n\nWhat are the probabilities of a 2024 Bitcoin supercycle?\n\nCointelegraph asked billionaire venture capitalist and serial blockchain investor Tim Draper what he thought the possibilities were for a 2024 Bitcoin supercycle. According to him, \u201cI think it will be the following cycle, when we can run our businesses unimpeded by regulatory uncertainty, where we can buy our food, clothing, shelter and taxes all in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nJulian Liniger, CEO of Bitcoin-only exchange Relai, told Cointelegraph that the market \u201cwill see a drastic reduction in supply due to the upcoming halving, while Bitcoin ETFs and the generally increasing interest in the asset Bitcoin mean a significantly higher demand.\u201d\n\nLiniger added that factors like a loss of confidence in fiat currencies, increased banking oversight and the collapse of exchanges like FTX \u201cstrengthen the Bitcoin narrative.\u201d\n\nMagazine: This is your brain on crypto: Substance abuse grows among crypto traders\n\n\u201cWith BlackRock and other major players on board, I also think it\u2019s not unlikely that we will see a radical 180-degree turn in the public perception of Bitcoin. Instead of a speculative asset that consumes as much electricity as entire countries, Bitcoin could soon be seen as a safe haven promoting the transition to renewable energies,\u201d he said.\n\nBitget managing director Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph that in order for the supercycle to happen, \u201cThe market needs ample funds to counter negative sentiments. Firstly, reestablishing easy access channels between traditional finance and the crypto market, especially after the suppression of three crypto-friendly banks. Secondly, global governments, including the U.S., must officially recognize Bitcoin assets as equal to gold and stocks. This involves removing restrictions on the trading and holding of Bitcoin for the general public. Such integration with traditional finance provides the foundation for widespread Bitcoin adoption and creates favorable conditions for the Bitcoin superycle to materialize.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin supercycle is likely not upon the world for this continued adoption cycle. There is simply too much speculation over adoption and daily usage happening globally for the asset to have no or just a soft correction to cushion the fall once the Minsky moment pops the bubble. 2028, on the other hand, may be a different story altogether.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin is trading at its highest level in more than 18 months, with its price up more than 100 per cent since the start of 2023.\n\nThe rally has pushed bitcoin\u2019s market cap above $700 billion and the overall crypto market close to $1.5 trillion. The figure is still a long way from its all-time high of around $3 trillion, which was reached at the end of 2021, however some crypto analysts believe the recent gains are the beginning of another record-breaking run.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hash rate \u2013 which denotes how much computing power is required to verify transactions and generate new units of the cryptocurrency through a process called mining \u2013 hit a record high this week, according to data from Blockchain.com.\n\nThis signals a resilient network, with hopes of future price gains attracting an increasing number of miners. Recent reports have revealed significant investment in cryptocurrency mining from both state-backed and commercial ventures.\n\nTether, the issuer of the stablecoin USDT is planning to invest $500 million in mining, while satellite imagery analysed by Forbes suggests Bhutan\u2019s government is establishing a massive bitcoin mining operation in the foothills of the Himalayas.\n\nSeparate data reveals that miners have been profiting from cheap energy sources to reduce their average BTC production cost by 35 per cent from $21,100 to $13,800.\n\n\u201cThis data underscores a considerably stronger profitability in the mining sector compared to the challenges experienced throughout 2022 and part of 2023,\u201d said research analyst Matteo Greco from the fintech investment firm Fineqia International.\n\nIn roughly six months, bitcoin will undergo an event known as a \u201chalving\u201d, which will see the amount of new bitcoins awarded to miners cut by half.\n\nThe event was hardcoded into bitcoin\u2019s underlying blockchain by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, who introduced it as an anti-inflationary measure when the cryptocurrency first launched in 2009.\n\nTaking place approximately every four years, the build up to the halvings have traditionally been the most profitable time for crypto investors.\n\n\u201cBuy bitcoin six months before a halving and sell 18 months after a halving has historically beaten \u2018buy and hold\u2019 trading strategy,\u201d Dutch crypto trader PlanB wrote earlier this year. \u201cThe next halving is April 2024...

        "content": "Bitcoin BTC -2.44% 's price could surpass $40,000 this year after Binance\u2019s DOJ settlement and former CEO Changpeng Zhao\u2019s guilty plea to financial violations signaled a turning point in the crypto landscape, according to Matrixport analyst Markus Thielen.\n\nBinance's agreement to pay $4.3 billion in fines marks one of the largest corporate settlements in U.S. history. After stepping down as CEO, Zhao will pay a $50 million fine and a $175 million personal recognizance bond. He also faces a possible 18-month prison sentence, with a hearing set for Feb. 23.\n\nThe outcome, less severe than a feared $10 billion fine and not accusing Binance of misappropriating user funds or alleging market manipulation, suggests it will likely remain a top-three exchange over the next 2 to 3 years, the analyst argued.\n\nDespite the Binance news initially being perceived as a risk-off event, bitcoin only experienced a temporary correction, Thielen said, bouncing back from the $36,000 level in a \"robust counter-trend reaction.\u201d with \u201cbitcoin surging above $40,000 inevitable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe anticipate bitcoin surpassing $38,000 by the end of this month with an 80% probability, followed by a rally above $40,000 in December with 90% probability,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nBitcoin seasonality\n\nOctober 2023 saw bitcoin's price soar by 28%, a trend that may continue with the anticipated approval of a bitcoin spot ETF in the U.S., the Matrixport analyst said, something that would further underscore confidence in bitcoin as a legitimate asset class.\n\nSeasonality is another factor, with average December returns of 12% potentially lifting bitcoin to $42,000 by this metric alone, he added.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nTether\u2019s USDT market capitalization increases by $5 billion\n\nSince September, Tether\u2019s USDT market capitalization has increased by $5 billion, signaling a growing trend among institutional investors shifting from fiat into stablecoins, potentially converting them into other cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, Thielen said.\n\n\u201cLast night, another $600 million USDT appeared to be minted, potentially signaling inflows into bitcoin after the Binance/CZ deal with U.S. enforcement authorities that seemed to increase the probability that a U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF could be approved by January,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nMacro environment supportive of crypto\n\nThe macro-environment also continues to support crypto, Thielen said, with Matrixport anticipating another halving of inflation toward 1.6% and a decline in bond yields to 2.60% by 2024 or 2025, following the peak of the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield at 4.95% in this cycle.\n\nThe adjustment in bond yields is expected to usher in a surge for the stock market, which often correlates with cryptocurrencies, the analyst added."

Stocks and bonds are also now more correlated, so investors get fewer diversification benefits from pairing them together.

        "title": "5 takeaways from America\u2019s biggest crypto crackdown in history - CNN",
        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nThe US government just sent a clear message to the world of cryptocurrency, a market valued at around $1.4 trillion.\n\nJust as crypto investors were hoping to move on from the historic conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder and former CEO of the collapsed FTX crypto exchange, US officials displayed yet another show of force against criminal activity surrounding crypto.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, pled guilty on Tuesday to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program, potentially allowing bad actors of all kinds to use the platform to move money.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the largest penalty ever imposed on a money services business in United States history, which just so happens to be a crypto firm:\n\nIt\u2019s going to take even more time for the crypto industry to wipe away its tainted image\n\nZhao and Bankman-Fried were largely seen as the faces of the crypto industry. Now his guilty plea, along with Bankman-Fried\u2019s conviction, means that good actors in the crypto industry will have to make a more convincing case to skeptics to prove the two were exceptions and not the norm.\n\nIn light of Tuesday\u2019s news, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, took the opportunity to distinguish the crypto exchange he heads from Binance, which admitted to engaging in anti-money laundering, unlicensed money transmitting and sanctions violations.\n\n\u201cSince the founding of Coinbase back in 2012 we have taken a long-term view. I knew we needed to embrace compliance to become a generational company that stood the test of time,\u201d Armstrong said in a post on X Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s news reinforces that doing it the hard way was the right decision. We now have an opportunity to start a new chapter for this industry,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the same time, the government agencies overseeing crypto regulation and compliance don\u2019t want people to forget Bankman-Fried and Zhao.\n\n\u201cIn just the past month, the Justice Department has successfully prosecuted the CEOs of two of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges in two separate criminal cases,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cThe message here should be clear: Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disrupter. It makes you a criminal.\u201d\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the former chief executive officer of Binance, pled guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and faces a maximum sentence of 18 months in prison. Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nFor crypto, this isn\u2019t the FTX firestorm\n\nCryptocurrencies dipped on Tuesday as investors digested the latest regulatory news out of Washington DC. But by Wednesday, they had made a roaring comeback.\n\nBinance coin initially dropped about 6% after the US Department of Justice announced that it had brought charges against Zhao following a multi-year investigation into Binance. On Wednesday morning, prices had swung 3.5% higher.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies suffered on Tuesday as a larger crackdown by the Feds also roped in crypto firms like Kraken and Tether.\n\nBitcoin dropped by about $420, 1.1%, to $37,071. Ethereum, meanwhile, fell by $40, or 2%, to $1,997 per coin.\n\nBy Wednesday, both bitcoin and ethereum were back up. Bitcoin was up by 2.4%, and ethereum was 5% higher.\n\nSo what explains the swings?\n\nSome reports out late on Tuesday suggested that Zhao\u2019s deal with the Department of Justice could allow him to keep the majority of Binance\u2019s shares. That buoyed investors\u2019 hopes. They were also simply eager to see the long investigation finally wrap up.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s been a good year for crypto. Bitcoin is up by about 120% year-to-date. Ethereum has risen nearly 70% over the same period.\n\nBinance is exiting the US, but it isn\u2019t going away\n\nThe deal Binance reached with the government requires it to cease operating in the US.\n\nOn Tuesday evening people based in the US were greeted with a notice on the Binance.com site saying it \u201cis unavailable in your country or region.\u201d But there\u2019s a bit of fine print.\n\n\u201cIf you are in the United States or select U.S. territories, Binance.US is a U.S. regulated platform where you can buy, trade, convert, and stake crypto with low fees,\u201d the notice continued.\n\nBinance.US is a subsidiary of Binance that was created in 2019 to \u201cto serve U.S. consumers and adhere to U.S. regulations,\u201d according to a post on the site.\n\nBinance.US is not impacted by Tuesday\u2019s announcement, since it is a registered money services business, Treasury officials said. That means that people in the US could still buy and sell crypto under the Binance roof.\n\nThe feds are cracking down a lot harder on crypto these days\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement is a vivid example of the federal government\u2019s tough stance on illicit activities involving crypto. To put it simply, the feds \u2014 from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Treasury Department \u2014 aren\u2019t playing around.\n\nJust this week, the SEC sued Kraken, another crypto exchange, alleging that it is operating as an unregistered securities exchange. The agency\u2019s suit also alleges that the exchange comingled customers\u2019 assets with the company\u2019s own holdings.\n\nThat is not the first time the SEC has sued Kraken. In fact, it is one of several suits the agency has filed just this year against crypto companies such as Bittrex and Coinbase. The SEC\u2019s suit against Binance for allegedly violating investor-protection laws remains in litigation.\n\nBinance is exiting the US as part of the agreement the crypto exchange made with law enforcement agencies. Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDespite suffering some unfavorable rulings this year, the SEC is expected to continue to aggressively clamp down on crypto firms by taking them to court.\n\nBut if Tuesday\u2019s major announcement made anything clear, it is not only the SEC that is trying to keep crypto malfeasance at bay: It is the entire federal government.\n\nThat also includes the Justice Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , and the Treasury Department. There is even a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team within the Justice Department actively identifying and investigating criminal cases involving digital assets.\n\n\u201cWhile criminal and civil enforcement actions are subject to different legal standards, this collective effort represents the whole-of-government approach that we are taking to combat corporate crime,\u201d Garland said Tuesday.\n\nThere is still an appetite for new regulation\n\nUS officials already have a nifty toolbox of regulations at their disposal to root out financial crimes, such as laws criminalizing money laundering and bank fraud.\n\nThat is precisely how the feds secured the first ever corporate settlement with a crypto exchange.\n\n\u201cYou have seen both in our actions today and in prior cases that we will be relentless in using every tool that we currently have to deploy against those who seek to use technologies in a way that abuse those platforms \u2026 or [that] don\u2019t prevent the use of those platforms for illicit activities,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said during Tuesday\u2019s presser.\n\nBut officials suggested that there\u2019s room for new regulation.\n\nCalls for \u201cregulatory clarity\u201d are not new, and new crypto regulations could help both investors and law enforcement officials discern legitimate crypto products from criminal facades.\n\nIt is unclear how or when comprehensive crypto regulation would come about. One way is through rulemaking at the agency level either at the SEC or CFTC, which would still be subject to judicial review if challenged in the courts, and another is through Congress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve advocated for filling in some of these gaps, specifically around commodity tokens, and I do think if we\u2019re able to do that, obviously with Congress\u2019s help, we can prevent these actions from happening and not have to be here after the fact,\u201d CFTC Chair Rostin Benham said Tuesday."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s Hash Rate Hits All-time High, Shows Strong Network Ahead of Halving\n\nThe hash rate of Bitcoin has reached an all-time high level, demonstrating the network's increased resilience in preparation for the highly anticipated halving event next year. According to Blockchain.com, the total hash rate of Bitcoin reached 491 exahashes per second (TH/s) on Wednesday, indicating that mining machines worldwide are performing 491 quintillion hash computations every second.\n\nHash rate refers to the amount of computing power utilized per second, and higher hash rates make it more difficult for malicious actors to gain control of over 50% of the Bitcoin network. This surge in hash rate suggests a rise in mining activity as miners expand their operations and employ more machines to maximize their profits.\n\nHashing, which is the process of converting data into fixed-length character strings, plays a critical role in various Bitcoin network activities, including the creation of private keys for transactions\n\nWhile higher hash rates lead to increased energy consumption and costs for miners, the upcoming halving event, expected in April, has prompted miners to invest in more efficient machines, contributing to the rising hash rate. During the halving, the amount of newly minted Bitcoin awarded to miners is reduced by half every four years, which helps control the inflation of BTC. Despite past criticisms of Bitcoin's energy consumption, the rising hash rate highlights the ongoing efforts of miners to improve efficiency and sustainability within the industry.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "\u201cSo I heard BlackRock launched a bitcoin ETF,\u201d your uncle might say at the Thanksgiving table.\n\nHow will you respond?\n\nWell, first you can clarify that he (let\u2019s call him Jim) means an ETF, or exchange-traded fund. And while the asset management giant indeed wants to bring such a product to market, it does not yet have approval.\n\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Uncle Jim says as he collects another forkful of mashed potatoes. \u201cI can\u2019t say I know much about it beyond all the headlines.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right \u2014 the story has been the subject of numerous stories in recent months. Yet, misconceptions persist.\n\nBlackRock is not the only one pursuing a bitcoin ETF. About a dozen companies \u2014 including Ark Invest and 21Shares, as well as Fidelity, Invesco and Bitwise \u2014 have similar proposals before the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nGrayscale Investments has said its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is ready to operate as an ETF upon receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.\n\nYour dad\u2019s brother then asks: \u201cSo, do you think this whole bitcoin ETF thing will happen then? And what\u2019s the big deal anyway?\u201d\n\nRead more: To gauge impact of bitcoin spot ETF, analysts look to gold\n\nFeel free to opine on the topic if you wish. But here are some facts to have at the ready.\n\nFirst, the SEC has consistently blocked bitcoin ETFs from coming to market for a decade or so. These funds, if approved, would hold BTC directly and give investors exposure to the asset within an investment vehicle accessible via traditional brokerage accounts.\n\nETFs \u2014 which hold roughly $7 trillion in assets \u2014 are a tool used by retail investors and financial advisers alike.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts say they think the chance of spot bitcoin ETF approval by Jan. 10 \u2014 the SEC\u2019s deadline to rule on a bitcoin ETF proposal by Ark Invest and 21Shares \u2014 is 90%.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\n\u201cBut what are they basing that on?\u201d Uncle Jim asks. \u201cWhy would the SEC all of a sudden approve a bitcoin ETF?\u201d\n\nThere are a few factors at play here, and you could explain \u2014 if he has the patience to listen, since Ol\u2019 Jim\u2019s eyes may have found the Lions game on the television behind you. Perhaps Jared Goff connected with Amon-Ra St. Brown for a go-ahead score. When did Detroit\u2019s football team get good?\n\nBut back to bitcoin ETFs \u2014 what\u2019s different now?\n\nBlackRock filing for a spot bitcoin ETF in June certainly turned heads. The company manages more than $9 trillion in assets and has only ever had one product proposal denied by the SEC in nearly 600 attempts, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. BlackRock\u2019s push spurred a new wave of bitcoin ETF proposals across the financial sector.\n\nElsewhere, Grayscale won a court case against the SEC in August \u2014 a ruling that limits the criteria on which it would be able to deny the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF, should it try to do so again.\n\nThe SEC had a chance to challenge the legal decision as late as last month, but opted not to.\n\nBeyond that, fund issuers have amended their bitcoin ETF proposals, signaling an ongoing dialogue with the SEC.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\n21Shares president Ophelia Snyder said during a Monday interview on Bloomberg TV that there has been a \u201cpattern break\u201d as issuers have begun to offer more information on what these products would look like.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really positive, because, very candidly, change in behavior might actually result in a change of outcome,\u201d Snyder added.\n\nAs recently as Monday, members of the SEC\u2019s division of trading and markets met with executives from BlackRock and Nasdaq about the proposed iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\n\u201cI guess only time will tell,\u201d Uncle Jim concludes at the dinner table, seemingly ready to move on to dessert.\n\nRight he is.\n\nThe table topic indeed shifts.

        "title": "Milei presidential victory fuels optimism in Argentina's Bitcoin community - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After a long and dramatic presidential race, libertarian candidate Javier Milei triumphed in Argentina\u2019s presidential election on Nov. 19.\n\nMilei promises to abolish the country\u2019s central bank, among a slew of other radical policy changes capturing the attention and imagination of the crypto community.\n\nWith 99% of the vote counted on Sunday, Nov. 19, Milei was declared the winner. The flamboyant politician secured the favor of 55% of the electorate, with three million more ballots to his name than rival Sergio Massa.\n\nFernando Nikoli\u0107, an Argentine Bitcoin (BTC) advocate and founder of media analyst firm Bitcoin Perception, told Cointelegraph that Milei \u201chas spoken positively about Bitcoin when asked about it in interviews,\u201d but also pointed out that enthusiasm should be tempered by the fact that \u201cpassing any sort of law that is considered \u2018Bitcoin-friendly\u2019 is not a part of his official program.\u201d\n\nNikoli\u0107 added that as an advocate for free market money, Milei is also unlikely to pass any laws that would harm Bitcoin.\n\nIv\u00e1n Paz, the CEO of crypto trading platform Trading Different, took a positive view of the election results. According to Paz, Milei\u2019s free market policy agenda is likely to reinvigorate Argentina\u2019s flagging economy.\n\n\u201cArgentina will enter a cycle of accelerated economic recovery, driven by the confidence of local and foreign investors,\u201d Paz told Cointelegraph. \u201cThe reduction of the tax burden and the legal guarantee will once again make Argentina an attractive country to project in the long term.\u201d\n\nMany Argentinians now look forward to sweeping reforms. Camilo Jorajur\u00eda de Le\u00f3n, vice-president of Bitcoin Argentina, reminded the incoming president to keep his electoral promises:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is for monetary freedom, and that was precisely one of the proposals of the president-elect. As Bitcoiners, we hope he fulfills his promise.\u201d\n\nMilei\u2019s first task in office will be taming the nation\u2019s runaway inflation, which hit 143% in October. For comparison, United States inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 and is now 3.2%. With the spending power of the Argentine peso in freefall, it\u2019s little wonder that Argentinians voted for the candidate proposing to cut almost all public expenditure and big government.\n\nThe new politics of Argentina\n\nMilei promises to reinvent and reinvigorate Argentina\u2019s economy with a completely new approach. The beliefs that underpin the policy agenda of the libertarian anarcho-capitalist are likely to resonate with many in the crypto community.\n\nHis headline policies include \u201cblowing up\u201d the central bank to prevent money printing, ditching the peso in favor of the U.S. dollar and scrapping almost every form of welfare in the country.\n\nRecent: Can blockchain supply the guardrails to keep AI on course?\n\nThe president-elect confirmed his future plan for government departments in a dramatic video circulating on social media.\n\n\u201cMinistry of Sports and Tourism \u2014 out!\u201d said Milei. \u201cMinistry of Culture \u2014 out! Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development \u2014 out!\u201d\n\nIn the video, Milei punctuates every cut by tearing the name of the department off a whiteboard and tossing it aside.\n\nArgentina's new president and Donald Trump fan Javier Milei has promised to radically change the country. Could he succeed? Read more https://t.co/nU9XYLTqBN pic.twitter.com/Z8gYllY4JV \u2014 TalkTV (@TalkTV) November 22, 2023\n\nMilei on Bitcoin\n\nWhile President-elect Milei may embody a maverick spirit that appeals to Bitcoiners and the ideological proclivities of the cryptosphere, that is not the same thing as actively supporting it.\n\nThe president-elect previously outlined why Bitcoin is useful as a monetary instrument free from state control. In a video posted to Reddit\u2019s r/bitcoin 11 months ago, Milei states his position.\n\n\u201cWhat is the point? The point is that the first thing we have to understand is that the central bank is a scam,\u201d said Milei. \u201cIt is a mechanism by which politicians cheat the good people with inflationary tax. What Bitcoin is representing is the return of money to its original creator \u2014 the private sector.\u201d Milei adds:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the natural reaction against central banker scammers and to make the money private again.\u201d\n\nThe new president may praise Bitcoin as a financial instrument, but that is somewhat different from what Bitcoin advocates may wish for. Undoubtedly, there are those who hope Argentina will adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nWhat Bitcoiners think of Melei\n\nCointelegraph asked Nikoli\u0107 what the election of Milei means for cryptocurrency advocates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe this will drastically alter the current landscape,\u201d Nikoli\u0107 said. \u201cArgentinians have been embracing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for many years. My hope is that, in the long term, Argentina becomes more entrepreneur-friendly, prosperous and free, helping to mend the significant cracks in the country\u2019s foundational structure.\u201d\n\nNikoli\u0107 added that the \u201cwidespread adoption of Bitcoin across the nation may be slow if 50% of its citizens live below the poverty line and lack an understanding of savings concepts.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not something that can change overnight. Milei\u2019s policy broader economic policies will need time to bed in.\n\nAs for the million-dollar question: \u201cWill Bitcoin become legal tender in Argentina?\u201d Nikoli\u0107 suggests that legal tender certification may be marginally less important than it seems.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m of the view that adoption is more robust when it emerges organically from the grassroots rather than being imposed top down. I\u2019m hopeful that Bitcoin adoption in Argentina will continue to flourish, especially as the country progresses under Milei\u2019s leadership and its people begin to experience improved living conditions.\u201d\n\nThe economics of Argentina\n\nSoaring inflation is not the only problem facing Milei in government. When the president-elect takes office on Dec. 10, he will take the reigns of a country facing a laundry list of economic challenges.\n\nChief among them is the fact that Argentina is the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) biggest borrower. The country owes the IMF a massive $31 billion.\n\nThe body gave the president a nod and a wink as early as Monday. Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, was among those congratulating Milei on his electoral success.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working closely with him,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulations to President-elect Javier Milei @JMilei. We look forward to working closely with him and his administration in the period ahead to develop and implement a strong plan to safeguard macroeconomic stability and strengthen inclusive growth for all Argentinians. \u2014 Kristalina Georgieva (@KGeorgieva) November 20, 2023\n\nEconomist Nicol\u00e1s Litvinoff believes Milei will need to get the IMF monkey off his back as a matter of first priority.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing is to regain autonomy in terms of monetary policy. On the one hand, to accumulate reserves in the central bank that are practically non-existent now,\u201d said Litvinoff before adding that Milei must \u201crestore the purchasing power of wages to reactivate consumption and the economy[\u2026] but for that, you need the International Monetary Fund out of the way.\u201d\n\nWho is Javier Milei?\n\nMilei first came to prominence as an economist, author and political commentator.\n\nWestern media outlets compare Milei to former U.S. President Donald Trump, but the similarities drawn are often shallow. Both men are populists from outside the political mainstream. Both men rode a wave of public disaffection to electoral success. Both men have unconventional hair.\n\nSuch comparisons are just as likely to obfuscate as enlighten.\n\nMilei was born in 1970 in Argentina\u2019s capital Buenos Aires. He was raised as a Catholic, which informs his politics to this day. While Milei is mostly socially liberal, he is opposed to both abortion and euthanasia. He supports freedom of choice on drugs, guns, prostitution and same-sex marriage.\n\nIn his youth, Milei sang in a Rolling Stones cover band. His presentation style owes much more to the rock world than to the political.\n\nDuring the campaign, Milei the showman brought a chainsaw to his rallies, frequently revving it up and raising it triumphantly above his head.\n\nRecent: Former Coinbase exec posits blockchain-driven vision of future societies\n\nFor supporters, Milei\u2019s chainsaw was a metaphor for the drastic cuts his administration would take to curb government spending and reign in inflation. For opponents, the chainsaw represented something else: a dangerous and cavalier individual waving around a chainsaw in public.\n\nThey dubbed him \u201cEl loco\u201d \u2014 the crazy one \u2014 or madman. That was little matter. Milei\u2019s message and style resonated with voters sick of the status quo, no matter how crazy he seemed to the doubters.\n\nAs for his rival Sergio Massa, the chainsaw took on a final, more ominous meaning as Milei cut him down this weekend in a very public chainsaw massacre. Now that Milei has the keys to the president\u2019s office, the clean-up of Argentina\u2019s broken system must begin."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market recently experienced events that were previously expected to present a severe negative price impact, and yet, Bitcoin (BTC) traded near $37,000 on Nov. 22 \u2014 essentially flat from three days prior.\n\nSuch performance was utterly unexpected given the relevance of Binance\u2019s plea deal on Nov. 21 with the United States government for violating laws involving money laundering and terror financing.\n\nBearish news has had limited impact on Bitcoin price\n\nOne might argue that entities have been manipulating Bitcoin\u2019s price to avoid contagion, possibly involving the issuing of unbacked stablecoins \u2014 especially those with direct ties to the exchanges suffering from regulatory pressure. Thus, to identify whether investors became highly risk-averse, one should analyze Bitcoin derivatives instead of focusing solely on the current price levels.\n\nThe U.S. government filed indictments against Binance and co-founder Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao in Washington state on Nov. 14, but the documents were unsealed on Nov. 21. After admitting the offenses, CZ stepped away from Binance management as part of the deal. Penalties totaled over $4 billion, including fines imposed on CZ personally. The news triggered a mere $50 million in BTC leveraged long futures contracts after Bitcoin\u2019s price momentarily traded down to $35,600.\n\nIt is worth noting that on Nov. 20, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission sued crypto exchange Kraken, alleging it commingled customer funds and failed to register with the regulator as a securities broker, dealer and clearing agency. Additionally, the complaint claimed Kraken paid for operational expenses directly from accounts containing customer assets. However, Kraken said the SEC\u2019s commingling accusations were previously earned fees, so essentially their proprietary assets.\n\nAnother potentially disastrous tidbit of news came from Mt. Gox, a now-defunct Bitcoin exchange that lost 850,000 BTC to a hack in 2014. Nobuaki Kobayashi, the Mt. Gox trustee, announced on Nov. 21 the redemption of $47 million in trust assets and reportedly plans to start the first cash repayments to creditors in 2023. Even though there was no information regarding the sale of Bitcoin assets, investors speculated that this final milestone is closer than ever.\n\nSeveral experienced traders and analysts had posted on social media that they anticipated a crypto market crash if Binance were indicted by the DOJ. Some examples are show below, and it is safe to say such a theory was almost a consensus among investors.\n\nETF denied, slow bleed is most likely, with a switch to hard crash if DOJ charges are unsealed soon against Binance. \u2014 Parrot Capital (@ParrotCapital) August 26, 2023\n\nI do not believe in coincidences. The Universe is rarely so lazy.\n\n\n\nExpecting ETFs to be rejected and DoJ to drop the hammer on Binance crushing bulls dreams for 2023. \u2014 McKenna (@Crypto_McKenna) July 31, 2023\n\nNotice how McKenna predicted that Binance would be indicted by the DOJ and further added that the ongoing Bitcoin spot exchange-traded (ETF) fund applications would be denied by the SEC. But as counterintuitive as it might sound, Binance going fully compliant increases the odds of a spot ETF approval. This is because it greatly weakens the SEC\u2019s main argument for previous denials, namely the excessive volume market share on unregulated exchanges.\n\nNothing concrete came out from the spot Bitcoin ETF in regard to recent regulatory actions, but the amends to multiple proposals are a hint of a healthy discussion with the SEC.\n\nBitcoin derivatives display resilience\n\nTo confirm if the Bitcoin price resilience aligns with professional investors\u2019 risk assessment, one should analyze BTC futures and options metrics. For instance, traders could have rushed to hedge their positions, which doesn\u2019t pressure the spot markets but vastly impacts BTC futures premium and options pricing.\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe price of Bitcoin monthly futures contracts tends to differ from regular spot exchanges since participants demand more money to delay the settlement. That\u2019s not exclusive to cryptocurrencies, and in a neutral market, it should stand near an annualized 5% rate.\n\nNotice how Bitcoin futures currently hold an 8% premium, which indicates excessive demand for leverage longs, but far from excessive. This level is lower than the 11.5% seen in mid-November but is quite positive given the recent regulatory news flow.\n\nRelated: BlackRock met with SEC officials to discuss spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nTo confirm if Bitcoin derivatives did not experience a huge inflow of hedge operations, one needs to analyze BTC option markets as well. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.\n\nWhen traders anticipate a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price, the delta 25% skew tends to rise above 7%, while periods of excitement typically see it dip below negative 7%.\n\nBitcoin options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nAs displayed above, the options 25% delta skew indicates optimism for the past four weeks, as the put (sell) options have been trading at a discount when compared with similar call (buy) options. More importantly, the recent news flow did not change professional traders\u2019 appetite for hedging strategies.\n\nOverall, there\u2019s no doubt that the impact of regulatory actions and the potential sell pressure from Mt. Gox caught the market in a great mood, given the derivatives indicators.\n\nAdditionally, the liquidation of $70 million leveraged BTC longs reduced the pressure from future negative price oscillations, meaning even if the price revisits $35,000, there\u2019s no indication of excessive optimism.\n\nSince the final round of ETF decisions is scheduled for January and February, there\u2019s little incentive for Bitcoin bears to pressure the market while negative news has had zero impact. Ultimately, the path to $40,000 becomes more certain.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Allocating just 1% to Bitcoin in investment portfolios can drive outperformance and mitigate risk, K33 research suggests.\n\nThat blend outperforms conventional portfolios by 3.16% and withstands market volatility.\n\nBitcoin benefits investment portfolios through risk reduction despite long-held views in financial circles about the viability of cryptocurrencies in conservative investment strategies.\n\nIf investors allocate just 1% to Bitcoin in a traditional portfolio normally made up of 60% equities and 40% bonds, it can markedly improve its overall performance, according to a report from K33 Research on Tuesday.\n\nA 1% Bitcoin allocation would reduce equities and bonds allocation by 0.5%, respectively.\n\nThe findings suggest that such a blend not only withstands market volatility, but also surpasses the performance of the conventional model by 3.16%.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nThe report also cautions that while a modest Bitcoin investment can enhance a portfolio\u2019s performance, significant exposure can introduce greater volatility and risk.\n\n\u201cSize allocation is a matter of taste and risk appetite,\u201d Vetle Lund, a research analyst at K33, told DL News.\n\n\u201cReturns outpace excess volatility, but the enhanced volatility is a clear disincentivising feature for conservative savers,\u201d Lund said, referring to the typical investor building a 60/40 portfolio.\n\nOther factors beyond volatility could affect investors\u2019 decisions to allocate Bitcoin to portfolios.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cLiquidity plays a part, volatility plays another part, and so do correlation regimes,\u201d Lund told DL News.\n\nLiquidity refers to the ability of market participants to execute buy or sell orders close to the prevailing market price.\n\nIn low liquidity markets price moves can be exacerbated by a smaller number of trades, which can make investments in these markets less desirable.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s liquidity conditions have been slowly recovering after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year.\n\nChanging landscape\n\nBitcoin allocations to portfolios also boost diversification. While Bitcoin has gone through periods of extreme correlation with equities in the past, signs suggest that could be changing.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has [returned] to a somewhat unpredictable path, independent of macroeconomic factors,\u201d K33\u2032s report said.\n\n\u201cThis has implications as Bitcoin again shines as a powerful portfolio diversifier,\u201d it added.\n\nThe previously observed correlations between traditional assets and Bitcoin dissipated as the cryptocurrency rode the wave over potential approval of spot Bitcoin-based Exchange-Traded Funds.\n\nBitcoin became negatively correlated with major US stock indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite between mid-September and mid-November, according to data from The Block Research, as spot ETF approval looked increasingly likely.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs are poised to appeal to conservative investors, offering a viable option to bolster the risk profile of their long-term savings portfolios.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission will start approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in the near future, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas told DL News on Monday. He expects approvals by mid-January.\n\nETFs represent Wall Street\u2019s gradual acceptance of crypto, Balchunas added.\n\n\u201cThese worlds have been trying to connect for 10 years.

        "title": "Binance users pull more than $1 billion from the exchange after CEO leaves, pleads guilty - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BNB.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nBinance cofounder and CEO Changpeng Zhao speaks during the 2022 Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, on Nov. 1, 2022. Ben Mcshane | Sportsfile | Getty Images\n\nOutflows from Binance have amounted to more than $1 billion in the past 24 hours, not including bitcoin, according to data from blockchain analysis firm Nansen, after founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao stepped down and pleaded guilty Tuesday in a deal with the Department of Justice. Meanwhile, liquidity has dropped 25% over the same time frame as market makers pull back their positions, according to data provider Kaiko. The outflows are significant and close to what happened previously when the exchange and its founder were charged with 13 securities violations by the SEC.\n\nThe exchange's native token, BNB, is down more than 8% in the last 24 hours. Binance holds around $2.8 billion worth of BNB tokens, according to Nansen. And in March, after Binance phased out zero-fee trading of crypto asset pairs including bitcoin, a key incentive for customers, the exchange began to see its share of all spot trading drop. Binance remains the world's largest crypto exchange globally, processing billions of dollars in trading volume every year. Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion in fines to the U.S. government. The plea deals end a yearslong investigation into the crypto exchange. Assets of more than $65 billion remain on the platform, according to Nansen, meaning that Binance is likely capitalized enough to withstand a sudden rush of investors away from the platform. And while withdrawals are on the up, there has not yet been a \"mass exodus\" of funds from the exchange. \"After the momentary shock of the agreement with the announcement, there is no significant impact on most assets,\" said Grzegorz Drozdz, a market analyst at investment firm Conotoxia Ltd. \"The cryptocurrency that seems to have suffered the most, losing more than 9%, is the BNB token from Binance. Of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, as many as 98 have seen a noticeable rebound over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, meanwhile, fell 4% before rebounding and remaining with a loss of 1.3%,\" he said. Drozdz added that it may be a net positive for the industry now that the dispute with regulators is behind Binance and that the company has pledged to increase security measures. \"This, combined with the likely imminent approval of an ETF based on bitcoin quotes, could positively impact the crypto market in the long term,\" said Drozdz.\n\nCan Binance survive at this stage?\n\nThat's the multibillion-dollar question the cryptocurrency giant faces after Zhao agreed to a plea deal and stepped down from the company. Started by the Chinese-born entrepreneur in 2017, Binance went from being a relatively obscure name to being a major force in crypto in a matter of weeks. Experts CNBC spoke with said that Binance is likely to make it through the ordeal despite a turbulent situation. They cited the company's decision to comply with the DOJ process and implement a three-year strategy to get its operations into compliance, and the amount of assets held within the company's reserves. \"The sum of $4 billion is clearly very large and will create real pain for Binance's balance sheet,\" Yesha Yadav, Milton R. Underwood professor of law and associate dean at Vanderbilt University, told CNBC via email. \"However, this fine does not appear aimed at dealing a fatal blow to the exchange. Based on Binance's dominant position within the crypto-ecosystem over a number of years, CZ's personal wealth ... and continuing trading volumes despite declines in overall crypto trading volume as well as in Binance's market share relative to other venues, I doubt that Binance will face risks to its solvency in paying this fine.\"\n\n$4.3 billion plea deal\n\nZhao and others were charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to implement an effective anti-money-laundering program and for willfully violating U.S. economic sanctions \"in a deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the U.S. market without implementing controls required by U.S. law,\" according to the Justice Department. Binance has agreed to forfeit $2.5 billion to the government and to pay a fine of $1.8 billion, for a total of $4.3 billion. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a press conference Tuesday that it's \"one of the largest penalties we have ever obtained.\" \"Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor. It makes you a criminal,\" Garland said. \"Binance prioritized its profits over the safety of the American people.\" Zhao said Tuesday in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that he had \"made mistakes\" and \"must take responsibility.\" Richard Teng, a former Abu Dhabi financial services regulator, was named as Zhao's replacement. Teng was most recently the global head of regional markets at Binance. He was also previously director of corporate finance at the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The action against Binance and its founder was a joint effort by the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Treasury Department. The Securities and Exchange Commission was notably absent. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a release Tuesday that the exchange allowed illicit actors to make more than 100,000 transactions that supported activities such as terrorism and illegal narcotics and that it allowed more than 1.5 million virtual currency trades that violated U.S. sanctions. It also allowed transactions associated with terrorist groups such as Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, al-Qaida and ISIS, Yellen said in the release, noting Binance \"never filed a single suspicious activity report.\" Zhao has been released on a $175 million personal recognizance bond secured by $15 million in cash and has a sentencing hearing scheduled for Feb. 23.\n\nBinance to continue"

        "content": "What Is Kraken?\n\nKraken is a cryptocurrency exchange based in San Francisco where market participants can trade various cryptocurrencies. The participants are allowed to buy or sell the cryptocurrencies using various fiat currencies, that include U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, and the Japanese yen.\n\nAs of January 15, 2023, Kraken is the world's third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, with a daily trading volume of $333 million according to exchange aggregator CoinMarketCap. Kraken allows trades in over 200 cryptocurrencies, and over 600 cryptocurrency pairs.\n\nVirtual currencies available on the Kraken exchange include the popular ones, like Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), and others that have gained traction in recent times, like EOS (EOS), Monero (XMR), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The platform also allows trades in cryptocurrency futures and derivatives.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Kraken is a cryptocurrency exchange based in San Francisco that was founded in 2011.\n\nAs of 2023, it is the world's third-largest exchange, with a daily trading volume of $333 million.\n\nAlong with other exchanges, Kraken has fallen under scrutiny by regulators for loose enforcement of controls against market manipulation and sanctions controls.\n\nOn Nov. 21, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Kraken, a US-based cryptocurrency exchange, for allegedly violating multiple infractions. Kraken is accused of commingling customer funds with company funds and operating an unregistered securities exchange, clearing agency, dealer, and broker. Both allegations may impact the operation of the cryptocurrency exchange and its customers' investments. To go with the lawsuit, on Feb. 9, 2023, Kraken agreed to pay $30 million in fines and closed its staking operation to settle with the SEC. However, Kraken is allowed to continue its staking process through its subsidiary for non-U.S. clients.\n\nHistory of Kraken\n\nKraken was established in 2011, and it formally launched trading operations in 2013. It is owned by Payward Inc. The current CEO is David Ripley, who replaced co-founder Jesse Powell in 2022.\n\nThe exchange provides the easy movement of money to and from the linked bank accounts of the participant, and the movement of cryptocurrencies to and from the participant's digital wallets from Kraken-linked trading accounts.\n\nIn 2014, as cryptocurrencies became more popular, Kraken, along with Coinbase exchange, was selected to provide the market data of bitcoin trading to the Bloomberg terminal. Getting associated with the leading market data provider helped Kraken gain popularity among the trader community. Bloomberg clients were then able to access virtual currency prices, charts, news, and social media posts through appropriate Bloomberg services and terminals.\n\nShortly afterward, Kraken partnered with the chart-service provider, TradingView. It continued to add more cryptocurrencies to its trading platform and enabled funding and trading in various fiat currencies like the USD, GBP, and JPY.\n\nKraken vs. Other Cryptocurrency Exchanges\n\nOver the years since its launch, a lot of factors have contributed to Kraken as a trading destination of choice for a variety of cryptocurrency market participants.\n\nAfter having a smooth initial phase post-launch, Kraken made headlines in late 2014, when it was selected \u201cto support an investigation into the missing bitcoins, as well as the distribution of remaining assets to Mt. Gox's creditors.\u201d\n\nMt. Gox, which once claimed to be the largest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy in early 2014. It was struggling with a huge debt pile, and 850,000 lost bitcoins.\n\nUp to that point, Kraken was not among the largest exchanges, and was primarily serving European customers through a partnership with Germany-based Fidor Bank, and had just started in Japan.\n\nIn February 2016, Kraken announced it was making significant progress in its Mt. Gox investigations and had approved numerous claims from thousands of creditors of Mt. Gox.\n\nGrowth during early 2015 was boosted by the launch of several new features that made cryptocurrency trading popular among the masses as well as among the professional traders community. It included launching the margin trading facility, and the dark pool services.\n\nDark pools clients are eligible for potentially better prices, as they are allowed to discreetly place large orders that get executed against similar-sized orders offering them price advantage.\n\n\n\nConcerns About Kraken\n\nIn May 2017, Kraken, along with the bitcoin exchange Poloniex, was hit with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, leading to huge losses for market participants.\n\nThe incident led to a class action lawsuit being filed against Kraken, where plaintiffs are seeking over $5 million which they claim they lost as a result of Kraken\u2019s mishandling of the DDoS attack.\n\nThe exchange has also fallen under scrutiny by government regulators. In 2018, the New York Attorney General identified it as one of several exchanges that were not following the state's financial regulations.\n\nIn 2019, the Office of Foreign Assets Control investigated Kraken for violating sanctions by transacting with customers based in Iran. The exchange settled for a penalty of $362,000, plus an additional $100,000 to be spent on enforcing sanctions controls.\n\nHow Do You Fund a Kraken Account? Kraken exchange users can start trading by creating an account and depositing their local currency. Note that the exchange requires customers to follow Know-Your-Customer protocols, including identity and image requirements.\n\nHow Big Is the Kraken Exchange? Kraken has a daily trading volume of $333 million, according to CoinMarketCap, although exchange volumes are particularly susceptible to manipulation. According to former CEO Jesse Powell, the exchange had about 6 million clients worldwide as of 2021.\n\nHow Do You Get a Coin Listed On Kraken? According to the Kraken Website, new listings are selected based on the qualifications of the project. Project developers and team leaders can propose a listing by emailing the details of their project to the exchange.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDespite recent challenges, Kraken remains among the most popular virtual currency trading platforms. While it is not uncommon to see even established stock exchanges get hit by temporary snags, the decentralized and anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies makes trading them very challenging.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrencies largely remain outside of the purview of government regulation, trading exchanges and marketplaces will need to balance regulations imposed by real-world regulators and the unknown, uncontrolled valuation mechanism of the various digital currencies.\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has seen a significant increase of over 120% since the start of the year, with Jim Cramer, host of CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money,\u201d recently suggesting that those interested in Bitcoin should consider buying more.\n\nCramer\u2019s past advice on Bitcoin has been inconsistent; in December 2022, he recommended selling crypto positions, calling them \u201cawful,\u201d but BTC\u2019s value has since doubled.\n\nEarlier in 2022, Cramer incorrectly assumed the market correction was over and advised increasing exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, not anticipating the severe market downturns, including the Terra crash and FTX meltdown.\n\nIs BTC Crash Inevitable?\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has made a remarkable comeback this year, with its price spiking over 120% since January 1. Despite its impressive performance lately and the anticipation of further gains in the near future, there is one advice that some cryptocurrency participants might find concerning.\n\nIt came from the well-known personality Jim Cramer \u2013 host of CNBC\u2019s TV show \u201cMad Money.\u201d He recently urged those like Bitcoin to increase their exposure to the primary digital asset:\n\n\u201cLook, if you like Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin. That has always been my view. And for a while, I liked it, and I decided that money had been made, but I was premature, but I made a lot of money.\u201d\n\nCramer has made countless comments and predictions involving the largest digital asset by market capitalization, and many times, those forecasts were far from spot on. This might be one reason why investors should be concerned of an inverse reaction and a potential BTC correction in the near future.\n\nWhen Was He Wrong?\n\nIn December last year, he advised individuals to sell their \u201cawful\u201d crypto positions, arguing it\u2019s never too late to exit the ecosystem. Recall that BTC has exploded over 100% since that counsel.\n\nOn another occasion, at the start of 2022 Cramer assumed the market correction was over, suggesting people should increase their exposure to Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital currencies. However, 2022 was far from profitable for crypto investors, witnessing severe collapses such as the Terra crash and the FTX meltdown."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin\u2019s hash rate has hit a new all-time high\u2014indicating that the network is stronger than ever. Just in time for next year's highly anticipated halving.\n\nThe total Bitcoin hash rate hit 491 exahashes per second (TH/s) Wednesday, according to data from Blockchain.com. This means that every second, mining machines around the world securing the Bitcoin network are making 491 quintillion hash computations.\n\nHash rate refers to the amount of computing power used per second. The more computing power used, the more difficult it is for attackers to take control of more than 50% of the Bitcoin network. It also means there is more mining activity on the network as miners expand their operations and use more machines to continue to make as much profit as possible.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHash computations\u2014or hashing\u2014is the process of turning data into a fixed-length string of characters. It is needed to do things on the Bitcoin network like create private keys so users can make transactions.\n\nA higher hash rate means that it is difficult for attackers to take over the network because the malicious attacker would need to get enough mining power from machines to match the current hash rate and disrupt it. This would be a costly and energy-consuming process.\n\nAnd a higher hash rate means that more energy is needed, which in turn means more powerful mining hardware. This could result in higher costs for miners and more energy consumption\u2014something Bitcoin has been frequently criticized for in the past.\n\nBut ahead of next year\u2019s halving\u2014an event where the amount of Bitcoin awarded to miners is halved every four years\u2014miners are buying more efficient machines, sending the hash rate up, investor relations manager at Northern Data Henrike Christin M\u00fcller previously told Decrypt.\n\nThe upcoming Bitcoin halving, the fourth of its kind since the cryptocurrency network launched in 2008, is expected to happen in April and is broadly viewed as a bullish indicator for the market. This is because the halving of rewards, baked into the Bitcoin protocol, is designed to keep BTC inflation in check.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEvery four years, the issuance of new Bitcoin is halved, reducing the supply of BTC that miners are able to unload onto the market\u2014and, if history is any indication, increasing demand for the existing BTC that is available on the market. Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, and there are currently just over 19.5 million coins in circulation."

Discover SCENE\n\nA luckless Bitcoin sender seemingly made a costly mistake, paying a record-breaking $3 million in transaction fees for a single transaction.\n\nBlockchain data shows that the Bitcoin sender intended to send 139.42 BTC (worth around $5.1 million), of which 83.64 BTC was gobbled up in transaction fees, leaving the recipient with just 55.77 BTC (around $2 million at today\u2019s prices). The transaction fee is the largest such payment in the history of Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that today\u2019s payment was made by mistake: though making a Bitcoin transaction can be costly when the network is busy, fees are not supposed to exceed the amount being sent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin miner AntPool processed the transaction in block 818087, per blockchain data from Bitinfocharts.\n\nBitinfocharts shows that the current average price to make a transaction on the Bitcoin network stands at $10.51.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that someone has fat-fingered a Bitcoin transaction recently; in September crypto firm Paxos paid a $500,000 fee to process a transaction worth just $2,000, though Bitcoin miner F2Pool agreed to refund the overpayment.\n\nAlthough this incident appears to be a mistake on the part of the sender, Bitcoin transaction fees have shot up this month due to renewed hype surrounding Bitcoin Ordinals. Ordinals, similar to non-fungible tokens, are digital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin.\n\nInscribing Ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain means more activity on the network, which means it\u2019s busier and therefore more costly to make a transaction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are options for those not wanting to pay much when sending or receiving the biggest cryptocurrency\u2014users are able to select lower fees before making a transaction. Though by doing so, they risk waiting around for hours as miners prioritize more lucrative transactions.\n\nAnd if the fee is too low, miners may completely ignore such transactions and it will never reach its destination."

Platts assessed the daily Nordic hydro guarantees of origin certificates for the current vintage year at Eur3.67/MWh Nov. 21, down from Eur3.76/MWh. Platts is part of S&P Global.\n\nSpanish baseload day-ahead power price swung into a discount to both France and Germany of almost Eur80/MWh for delivery Nov. 22, as Spanish wind power generation resulted in 50% of the load factor at almost 14 GW. Meanwhile, wind power generation is set to pick up in Germany for Nov. 23 and Nov. 24 to around 43 GW, a 67% of the load factor.\n\nWind power generation in France is registered to double Nov. 24 and 25 to 8.5 GW and 7.8 GW, respectively, Spotrenewables data showed. Platts assessed the daily European wind guarantees of origin current year vintage at Eur3.65/MWh, down from Eur3.74/MWh.\n\nPlatts assessed the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index at 386.85 MWh Nov. 21, meanwhile global network hashrate reached all time high."

        "title": "Despite lost trust, can cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin, be the future of investment again? - Scroll.in",
        "content": "Stocks have existed for more than a century. Bonds have been around for a few centuries. Commodities are centuries old and currencies have been exchanged since time immemorial. Now, there is a new asset class called \u201cCryptocurrencies\u201d which is gaining immense popularity all over the world. Work on blockchain technology began in the early 1990s, but was later used and designed by a person (or a group of people) under the pseudonym \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d. In 2008, he/ they released a white paper, \u201cBitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system\u201d and introduced to the world \u201cBitcoin\u201d.\n\nThis open, decentralised digital software has been gaining favour ever since. Before we talk about the potential and impact of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc., it is worth mentioning that equity investing has been beaten by the returns of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has given a return of 10,869 per cent since 2015 against 102 per cent of Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, 184 per cent of NASDAQ and 59 per cent of gold. Bitcoin has emerged as the clear leader. Therefore, having a small portion of cryptocurrencies in one\u2019s portfolio could be a smart move and worth the research.\n\nThe die-hard equity pundits have been denouncing cryptocurrencies for many years as a giant scam, however, slowly, a few hedge fund managers and institutions have had a transformation in their mindset and have started allocating their capital to cryptocurrencies and have even invested their treasury money into crypto assets! This is a big change and indicates a gradual shift in the attitude of influential investors. A lot of the naysayers missed out on the meteoric rise and gains from crypto assets and are now left with a painful left-out feeling. World economics are run by \u201cfiat money\u201d, which is essentially government-issued currency that is not backed by any commodity. This allows governments the flexibility to print money and keep control over their economies.\n\nGovernments have resorted to \u201cdebasement\u201d, which lowers the value of their currencies and increases the chances of inflation. Gold, traditionally, has been seen as a hedge against the debasement of currencies and inflation since it is a store of value and a preserver of purchasing power. Bitcoin has been called \u201cGold 2.0\u201d and even \u201cDigital Gold\u201d since it has certain characteristics that compete with and complement the intrinsic nature of gold.\n\nInterestingly, Nakamoto set the total limit of Bitcoin at 21 million, which means that there can only be 21 million Bitcoins in circulation at any point in time. There are several advantages of this limit that sets Bitcoin apart. Some of these are:\n\n\u2022 Every single transaction can be proved and is recorded in Bitcoin. This cannot be done for gold or other currencies.\n\n\u2022 Since the number of Bitcoin is limited, it is immune to any form of debasement and therefore a preserver of the purchasing power of the world and a store of value.\n\n\u2022 Other positive fundamentals of Bitcoin include an increasing number of transactions in the world, a rise in people using Bitcoin as \u2018wallets\u2019 and the growth of individuals, corporates and financial institutions embracing it for their investments.\n\n\u2022 Cryptocurrencies are enjoying the power of the \u201cNetwork effect\u201d \u2013 derived from Metcalfe\u2019s Law, which states that a network\u2019s value is proportional to the square of the number of its users. As more individuals participate and accept Bitcoin, the value of the cryptocurrency keeps growing. For example, if you are the only person using Google, then it will not be valuable. However, once millions of people use Google, it becomes useful and valuable.\n\n\u2022 Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, can be bought in a seamless manner, and as compared to securities, one does not have to worry about which company will eventually succeed and work.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin has an open decentralised digital protocol which is similar to the internet and its significance. Therefore, it has a strong and reliable computing network in this world, which allows for a high hash rate \u2013 meaning that the processing power of the network is high \u2013 which also creates greater security for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is portable, transferable and divisible. As an asset, it is durable and difficult to hack or fake. The wallets are encrypted and secure.\n\n\u2022 The verification of transactions is done by \u201cminers\u201d rather than a clearing house or exchange, as in the case of securities. Therefore, the process is quick and secure as well as inexpensive.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin can be exchanged for other goods and services, and also other cryptocurrencies and tokens.\n\nThese positive characteristics have led to crypto coming into vogue and accepting Bitcoin internationally. However, there is also a chorus of experts who are not yet comfortable owning cryptocurrencies. They cite many reasons. Some of them are enumerated below:\n\n\u2022 Some experts argue that cryptocurrencies can be a conduit for crime and money laundering. They cite that hoarding the crypto asset could be used to destabilise the dollar. There is a fear that non-state actors could attack the network to subvert economic functioning.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is not yet in the pantheon of currencies like the US dollar, Euro, or Pound. It is thus still a far cry from a replacement to any of these is still a far cry away.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is not properly regulated yet and the regulatory uncertainties create an atmosphere of risk around the asset. Proper regulation allows for the protection of investor interests, which traditional financial institutions, banks and money managers comply with.\n\n\u2022 Since no central bank is in charge of handling Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, the traditional role of central banks to set quantitative easing or tightening as and when the economy requires cannot be implemented. Economic growth and inflation control are actively supported by central banks.\n\n\u2022 Since the supply of Bitcoin is limited and fixed, it could lead to deflation if demand is not kickstarted with additional liquidity.\n\n\u2022 There is huge volatility in the price of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, which creates instability. \u2022 The wild price swings attract a lot of speculators and not holders who spend.\n\n\u2022 We have not yet seen employees getting paid in Bitcoin, which would prompt more sellers of goods and services to price their products in cryptocurrency. Most retailers are still reluctant to accept cryptocurrencies; therefore, they cannot function fully as a medium of exchange.\n\n\u2022 A plethora of cryptocurrencies have now sprung up, distracting from the main players like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n\u2022 People believe that crypto wallets can be hacked.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is facing an attack over energy use. To verify transactions, \u201cminers\u201d have to solve extremely complex math problems, which require superior computer systems that consume huge amounts of power, and use a lot of electricity. This means that many fossil fuels are being used to generate that power. There is a demand from investors to comply with better \u2018green\u2019 standards and use alternate power generation options.\n\nExperts of the stock markets and fund managers have traditionally ignored cryptocurrencies. They have argued that crypto assets have no price-earnings ratio or return on equity or cash flows to value them, which is why they have preferred to stay away from them. The valuation thesis of conducting a bottom-up analysis, i.e. trying to value a company based on its fundamentals, was found to be improbable and questionable for crypto assets. Further, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies display massive volatility of up to 15\u201330 per cent per day, so they decided not to jump onto the bandwagon.\n\nAlso, market pundits could not decide if Bitcoin was a commodity or a currency or even a security. Among other reasons, one was that blockchain technology was understood by only a few. Legendary investors have compared Bitcoin with gold and this has set into motion a number of companies, individuals and fund managers, rushing to buy crypto assets.\n\nExcerpted with permission from Investing Decoded: Simple Path to Building a Portfolio in Millions, Anirudh Rathore, Penguin India."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrypto lender Celsius Network has scaled back its post-bankruptcy business plans to focus only on bitcoin mining , citing U.S. regulators ' skepticism of its other planned business lines.Celsius, whose restructuring plan had also envisioned the company earning \"staking\" fees by validating blockchain transactions and managing its legacy portfolio of cryptocurrency loans, said in a statement late Monday it had changed course after receiving \"feedback\" from the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission. Celsius declined to comment on Tuesday. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan had approved Celsius' Chapter 11 plan on Nov. 9, clearing the company to return cryptocurrency to customers and create a new company owned by Celsius creditors.The SEC did not definitively say during Celsius' bankruptcy case whether the new company's business plans would violate U.S. law, but it reserved the right to make that determination later.The SEC has argued in past public statements that most crypto lending and staking activity should be regulated to ensure that customers have sufficient information about how their crypto assets are used.Celsius said it now plans to hold back certain assets that would have been transferred to the new company, and instead liquidate them as a part of the wind-down of its bankruptcy.Bitcoin mining was always meant to be the \"core business\" of the new company, Celsius said.The pivot has led to further negotiations with Fahrenheit, a consortium of bidders selected to lead the reorganized company. Celsius said it expects to seek court approval of a modified bankruptcy plan in the coming weeks.Celsius said the \"reduction in scope and scale\" of the new company should lead to lower management fees and increase the amount of cryptocurrency Celsius will directly return to customers beginning in January 2024.Fahrenheit, led by hedge fund Arrington Capital and U.S. Bitcoin Corp, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.New Jersey-based Celsius filed for Chapter 11 protection in July 2022, one month after freezing customer accounts to prevent withdrawals. Celsius, once valued at $3 billion, was one of the largest crypto collapses in 2022, along with FTX, Voyager Digital and BlockFi. Crypto lenders Voyager and BlockFi decided to fully shut down their businesses and return some crypto to customers during their bankruptcies."

        "title": "Trader: Bitcoin Will Inevitably Breeze Past $70,000\u2014Here\u2019s Why - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Taking to X on November 22, crypto chartist @MortensenBach presented a bullish outlook for Bitcoin (BTC), predicting that not only will the coin breeze past $70,000 in the coming months, but it will set a new all-time high, fanning demand for stocks of Bitcoin mining companies like Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital, and the rest.\n\nBitcoin Trading Above The 20-Period MA In The Monthly Chart\n\nThe chartist pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s historical tendency to launch parabolic advances following decisive breaks above its 20-month simple moving average (20 SMA) in the monthly chart. As of late November 2023, Bitcoin has been firm.\n\nAs evidenced in the monthly chart, buyers build on gains recorded in October when prices shook off losses and increased. This upswing was triggered by broader market optimism, which supported crypto prices.\n\nWith prices now trending firmly above the dynamic reaction line in the monthly chart, the trader believes a bull market is on the cards, and Bitcoin is set for more gains in the coming sessions. Besides the break above the 20-month MA, the analyst notes a growing bullish momentum, according to MACD, a technical indicator.\n\nStill, it should be noted that, despite the analyst\u2019s optimism, technical indicators in use, the MACD and MA, lag. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that prices will edge higher, rising from spot levels to nearly double above $70,000 in 2024 and months ahead. As of November 23, BTC prices are firm above $37,000 and more than 2X from November 2022 lows when prices plunged below $16,000.\n\nMoreover, it is yet to be seen how stocks of Bitcoin mining companies like Riot Blockchain will perform in the next stage after halving. However, historical performances show their stock tends to rally in lockstep with spot BTC prices.\n\nWhales Are Accumulating, Will BTC Surge?\n\nEven so, @MortensenBach\u2019s preview analysis ties closely to on-chain insights relayed by CryptoQuant, a blockchain analytics platform. According to data, more whales are moving their BTC from exchanges in large tranches.\n\nWith big players showing confidence and backing Bitcoin, it could suggest that they expect prices to edge higher. This outlook if further buoyed by developing fundamental factors, including regulatory action and general investor sentiment.\n\nBitcoin prices shook off the effect of the United States Department of Justice\u2019s ruling on Binance. Though prices slightly dipped below $37,000, bulls are back, and the coin is trending above $37,000. The market is tracking the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF in the country.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.
