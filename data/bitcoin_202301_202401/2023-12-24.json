        "title": "Crypto\u2019s 2023 was marred by fraud and scandal. It was its best year ever - CNN",
        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nCrypto\u2019s 14th year in existence was one marred by scandal, bankruptcy, fraud and regulatory squabbling. It still may have been the industry\u2019s best year ever.\n\nThe cast of \u201cCrypto 2023\u201d starred figures that are now practically synonymous with fraud: Sam Bankman-Fried, Changpeng Zhao, Alex Mashinsky, and, less prominently, Heather \u201cRazzlekhan\u201d Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein (aka \u2018Bitcoin Bonnie and Clyde\u2019).\n\nDespite all the bad press, the young industry notched some notable wins.\n\nBitcoin, the crypto\u2019s bellwether asset, is up 160% for the year. Two high-profile court cases came down in the industry\u2019s favor. And a long-awaited approval for a mainstream investment product is expected in January, potentially flooding the scene with new investors.\n\nLike the rest of the financial world, digital assets got a boost from an improving macroeconomic picture in cooling inflation, a growing economy, and a long-awaited end in sight for the Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes.\n\n\u201cIt was the year of crypto\u2019s resiliency,\u201d Kyla Curley, a crypto expert and partner at global advisory StoneTurn, tells CNN.\n\nOne big component of that resiliency is how US authorities, particularly the Department of Justice, flexed their enforcement muscles on crypto, even in the absence of clear regulations.\n\n\u201cFraud is fraud,\u201d Curley says, \u201cRegardless of the technology or the industry \ufeff\u2026 you cannot stop human nature. When it comes down to it, people will find a way to exploit the rules.\u201d\n\nThe bad-apple case for optimism\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, left, was convicted on seven counts of fraud in early November. Two weeks later, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges in a settlement with US authorities. Eduardo Munoz/Costas Baltas/Reuters\n\nNo figure loomed quite as large over crypto in 2023 than Bankman-Fried, the entrepreneur once hailed as a visionary who was found guilty in November of orchestrating a yearslong, multibillion-dollar fraud through his FTX trading platform.\n\nThe trial of SBF, as he\u2019s widely known, was the spectacle of the year for crypto\u2019s biggest critics and its most strident fans.\n\nFor those inclined to cast crypto as an elaborate scam, the trial pulled back the curtain on the fly-by-night fraud underpinning FTX, which attracted millions of mainstream investors with its pitch as a beginner-friendly way to get into the emerging digital asset space. The rapid rise and fall of SBF is now Exhibit A for crypto detractors.\n\nOn the flip side, the crypto faithful who made SBF a into a billionaire pseudo-savior also cheered his conviction, casting the verdict as a an overdue purge of a bad apple.\n\nA couple of weeks after the verdict, US authorities notched another enforcement slam dunk. Changpeng Zhao, aka CZ, the founder of the most popular crypto trading platform, Binance, pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges as part of a $4 billion settlement.\n\n\u201c2023 was a bad year for grifters and a good year for builders,\u201d says Faryar Shirzad, the chief policy officer for Coinbase. \u201cWe\u2019re going into 2024 with many of the worst of the grifters out of the market, and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nIn the two weeks following CZ\u2019s guilty plea, bitcoin surged 23% to reach $44,000 \u2014 its highest level in 18 months, as investors looked ahead to more positive news on the horizon.\n\nBitcoin bulls dig in\n\nThe main event for crypto in 2024 could come as soon next month, when US regulators are expected to greenlight applications for the very first spot bitcoin ETF, or exchange traded fund, in the American market.\n\nPut simply, a spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to track the price of bitcoin without actually owning the digital currency. That\u2019s appealing for mainstream investors for a few reasons. First, it gives everyday investors who are wary of crypto a relatively safe way to dip their toe in the notoriously volatile market.\n\nETFs also trade on traditional stock exchanges, which means investors can access them through their tried-and-true brokerage rather than creating a new account in the crypto-verse. And, of course, the prospect of regulatory oversight adds another layer of protection and transparency.\n\nThe upshot: There could be a lot of new money flowing into bitcoin very soon.\n\nAdding to that bullish sentiment: the bitcoin halving, or, more menacingly, \u201cthe halvening.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s often a buy-the-hype-sell-the-news kind of event, the halving does tend to push bitcoin higher. Essentially, bitcoin is a finite asset, and every four years the algorithm reduces the number of new tokens that can enter circulation by half (hence the name).\n\n\u201cThe \u2018halving\u2019 is the ultimate geek event for Bitcoiners in 2024,\u201d Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo, said in a statement. \u201cSo if history repeats itself \u2026 we may not see the peak in Bitcoin until sometime in 2025, with 2024 acting as an entr\u00e9e to the main event.\u201d\n\nTrenchev said the \u201ctwin-turbo boost\u201d of the spot ETF approval and the halving, expected in the spring, should propel bitcoin to $100,000 \u2014 a 45% jump over its all-time high of 69,000, reached in November 2021.\n\n\u201cThe road to $100,000 will be lined with unexpected potholes and double-digit declines as Bitcoin,\u201d said Trenchev. \u201cTo borrow a phrase from one its biggest detractors Warren Buffett, \u2018transfers money from the impatient to the patient.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor an even more bullish prediction, look to Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital and a longtime bitcoin evangelist.\n\n\u201cBitcoin ends the year at $140,000,\u201d he told the digital news outlet Semafor."

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value soared from the cost of electricity to mine Bitcoin in 2009 to over $43,407 by 2023.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance fell from 100% to 52% by 2023, diversifying the crypto landscape.\n\nThe crypto market cap grew from zero in 2009 to $1.63 trillion in 2023, outlining Bitcoin\u2019s and the crypto industries\u2019 meteoric rise over the last decade and a half.\n\nBitcoin demonstrated resilience and volatility, fluctuating prices due to global events and trends.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s journey from a price of $0.003 in 2009 to over $37,000 in 2023, alongside its fluctuating market dominance, highlights its status as a top-performing asset and store of value. Despite its dominance dropping from 100% to 52%, reflecting a more diverse crypto market, Bitcoin\u2019s significant volatility has been central to its rapid value appreciation.\n\nThis growth, mirrored by the crypto market cap\u2019s rise to $1.4 trillion in 2023, showcases Bitcoin\u2019s impact and profitability in the financial world over the last 15 years. Below is an outline of its trajectory, taking the price on Christmas day.\n\nYear Bitcoin Price On Christmas Day\n\n\u2013 $ Bitcoin Dominance CoinMarketCap\n\n\u2013 $ Billion 2009 0.003 100% 0.00 2010 0.25 99.5% 0.05 2011 4.07 99% 0.10 2012 13.34 98% 0.10 2013 669.50 98% 1.50 2014 320.20 98% 4.44 2015 449.92 99% 6.86 2016 883.73 95% 14.85 2017 14,146.95 48% 494.90 2018 3,881.91 55% 122.02 2019 7,206.91 70% 184.89 2020 24,165.49 69% 648.67 2021 50,654.88 40% 2.37 T 2022 16,801.54 43% 770.4 2023 43,407.50 52% 1.63 T\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Price Shift From 2009\u2019s Negligible Value To 2012\u2019s Steady Growth\n\n2009 To 2012\n\nIn its infancy, Bitcoin was a mere concept, valued at the price of electricity necessary to mine Bitcoin, which was roughly $0.003 in 2009, with the entire crypto market cap at virtually zero.\n\nBy 2012, as Bitcoin\u2019s price rose to $13.34, the total market cap reached $0.10 billion, indicating a young but growing interest in the cryptocurrency space. This period laid the groundwork for the crypto revolution despite the infant market.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Early Growth: Price Trends And Public Sentiment (2013 To 2016)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Emergence: A Look Back At 2013 To 2016\n\nThis era marked Bitcoin\u2019s entry into public consciousness. 2013 saw a significant surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $669.50 and the market cap expanding to $1.50 billion, signaling a bullish trend.\n\nHowever, the following years witnessed fluctuations, with the market cap reflecting these changes at $4.44 billion in 2014 and $6.86 billion in 2015, finally reaching $14.85 billion in 2016. These figures underscored the growing but volatile nature of the market.\n\nBitcoin Surge And Volatility Between 2017 And 2019\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Rollercoaster Ride: From 2017\u2019s Record Highs To 2019\u2019s Recovery\n\nDuring this era, Bitcoin experienced a period of substantial growth and corrections. The year 2017 was a milestone, with Bitcoin\u2019s price reaching $14,146.95 and the total market cap soaring to a staggering $494.90 billion.\n\nThis bubble, however, was followed by a significant correction in 2018, with the market cap dropping to $122.02 billion. The market cap 2019 ($184.89 billion) reflected a partial recovery, indicative of a market that was beginning to mature and stabilize.\n\nBitcoin During The COVID-19 Period (Between 2020 And 2022): Market Resilience and Pandemic Impact\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Evolution Through Pandemic Turbulence\n\nThe pandemic years were a testament to Bitcoin\u2019s resilience. In 2020, the price escalated to $24,165.49, with the market cap reaching $648.67 billion, driven by a surge in institutional investment and a quest for digital safe-haven assets.\n\nThe trend continued in 2021, with the market cap peaking at $2.37 trillion. However, 2022 saw a pullback in both price ($16,801.54) and market cap ($770.4 billion), reflecting global economic uncertainties and market corrections.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Throughout History\n\nBitcoin has stood as a pioneering force since its inception in 2009. Initially, Bitcoin held an unchallenged dominance of 100%, reflecting its status as the sole player and first cryptocurrency in the crypto market.\n\nThis dominance, a measure of Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization relative to the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies, remained exceedingly high in the early years, hovering around 98-99%. However, as the crypto market expanded and diversified, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance gradually reduced.\n\nFrom a commanding presence of nearly 100% in 2009, it experienced fluctuations, notably dropping to 48% in 2017 during the ICO boom and Ethereum\u2019s introduction into the crypto market in 2015-2017, then partially recovering and eventually stabilizing to a more contested position of around 52% by 2023.\n\nThis shift illustrates not just the growth of Bitcoin in absolute terms but also the rapid emergence and expansion of other cryptocurrencies, reshaping the digital asset landscape.\n\nChristmas Day And Bitcoin: Understanding Historical Price Patterns\n\nThe Christmas day price analysis reveals that Bitcoin\u2019s performance during this festive season mirrors the broader market trends. The market cap data adds context to these trends, showing how the entire crypto market has responded in tandem with Bitcoin\u2019s price movements.\n\nFor instance, the high market cap during the bull runs of 2017 and the pandemic years contrasts with the lower market caps during the bearish phases.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Christmas Day Price Predictions: Expert Opinions\n\nPredicting Bitcoin\u2019s future, especially based on Christmas Day prices, is difficult to predict. Adam Back, a key figure in the cryptocurrency sector, believes that Bitcoin\u2019s value could reach $100,000 before its next halving in April 2024.\n\nAdam Back explains that his prediction is influenced by factors such as the historical impact of Bitcoin halving events on Bitcoin\u2019s price, in prior years, increasing mainstream adoption, and broader economic conditions. However, caution is always advised to crypto investors because the crypto market is still young and influenced by various factors. Making predictions is challenging but intriguing for investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin\u2019s evolution to a store of value asset, digital gold, from the cost of electricity to a value of mere cents to tens of thousands of dollars is not just a story of financial growth but also one of technological innovation, evolving public perception and education, and the ever-changing dynamics of the global economy.\n\nThe fluctuating dominance of Bitcoin, once the unrivaled king of cryptocurrencies, is now sharing the stage with many other digital assets, particularly Ethereum, which highlights the diversification and maturation of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow has Bitcoin\u2019s price changed on Christmas Day since 2009?\n\nSince 2009, Bitcoin\u2019s Christmas Day price has grown from just $0.003 to $43,407.50 in 2023, reflecting its evolution from a novel concept to a significant financial asset.\n\nWhat does the decrease in Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance indicate?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s decreasing dominance, from 100% in 2009 to 52% in 2023, indicates a diversifying crypto market with the emergence of other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, expanding the digital asset landscape.\n\nHow did the crypto market cap evolve alongside Bitcoin\u2019s growth?\n\nThe crypto market cap has grown significantly, from virtually zero in 2009 to $1.4 trillion in 2023, mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s price increase and indicating increased investor interest and market maturity.\n\nCan Bitcoin\u2019s historical Christmas Day prices predict its future?\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s Christmas Day prices provide insights into historical trends, predicting its future based on these prices is complex due to the influence of various unpredictable market factors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information provided is for educational and analytical purposes only.

        "content": "After tumbling 65% in 2022, Bitcoin (BTC -5.98%) has been a monumental winner this year. The world's leading digital asset has skyrocketed about 160% in 2023, a gain that beats the stock market's gains by a huge margin.\n\nAs of this writing, this top cryptocurrency's price sits at about $43,700. However, I believe there's a very real possibility that it reaches the coveted $100,000 mark by the end of 2024.\n\nContinue reading to see why Bitcoin could hit a new all-time high.\n\nReady for take-off\n\nAs if Bitcoin's returns in 2023 weren't enough, there are multiple catalysts on the horizon that could propel it even higher.\n\nFor starters, there has been a lot of chatter about a potential spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). Major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission to bring these products to market. Many industry observers think these will be approved as early as January.\n\nBitcoin is set to benefit. Not only would spot ETFs provide a stamp of approval for this digital asset, essentially legitimizing it in the financial services industry, but also, lots of fresh capital could be directed toward Bitcoin. Higher demand could lift the price.\n\nMacro factors could also become more accommodative. With inflation continuing to show signs of cooling, Federal Reserve officials might be ready to cut rates several times in 2024. And this looser monetary policy is generally favorable for riskier assets.\n\nOf course, it's hard to know how much of this optimism is already factored into the price of Bitcoin. But these still are potentially positive developments to pay attention to.\n\nPerhaps the most potent catalyst is next year's halving. Happening approximately every four years, this event cuts in half the new supply of Bitcoin that enters the market. This situation of reduced supply paired with rising demand has usually been extremely bullish for Bitcoin. The next halving is expected in late April.\n\nMaintain the right mindset\n\nBefore going out and loading up on Bitcoin in your portfolio, it's a good idea not to forget that this is still a very volatile asset. For some investors, its up-and-down nature might be too hard to stomach. And for those in or near retirement, owning Bitcoin might be out of the question.\n\nEven for those who are ready to invest, buying only an amount that you are willing to lose is a smart strategy. That's particularly true for people who might not be familiar with Bitcoin. Obviously, as you learn more and gain greater conviction, boosting that allocation can be the right move.\n\nAs with all things investing, don't forget to maintain a long-term time horizon. With Bitcoin, this is doubly important. You should intend to hold for the next decade to watch how things develop. In other words, don't expect to get rich quick.\n\nAnd while I do believe $100,000 is a totally realistic outcome for Bitcoin in 2024, it's not a sure thing. The necessary elements are in place for a monster return, but it's impossible to know what will happen in the next 12 months.\n\nInvestors should definitely still be optimistic about Bitcoin. But the best investors also know that everything doesn't always go according to plan."

        "title": "How to buy Bitcoin in India - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The grand old cryptocurrency has had plenty of aficionados in the Indian crypto space. Consensus and YouGov conducted a global survey on crypto and Web3 in unison. They published a report on June 23, revealing that 32% of Indians had bought cryptocurrencies at some point, and 21% still owned digital assets. It also revealed that Bitcoin (BTC) dominated the cryptocurrencies purchased.\n\nLevying a 30% tax on income received from digital assets didn\u2019t dent the sentiment in the country regarding cryptocurrencies. According to a report published by the KuCoin cryptocurrency exchange, the digital assets market in India is expected to clock $241 million by 2030.\n\nAs the world\u2019s most populous country, with 1.4 billion people, India comes across as a country with millions of prospective cryptocurrency investors. Based on data from the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 68% of this demographic falls within the 15\u201364 age range, indicating a higher likelihood of interest in cryptocurrencies such as BTC.\n\nThis article explains how to buy Bitcoin in India on centralized and decentralized exchanges, systematic investment plan (SIP), over-the-counter (OTC) deals or direct peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges.\n\nHow to buy BTC on a centralized crypto exchange in India\n\nCatering to millions of prospective Bitcoin buyers, there are hundreds of centralized exchanges operating in India, both local and multinational. One needs to check factors such as ease of use, security and low fees when zeroing in on an exchange.\n\nOne needs to complete the exchange registration process, including verifying their phone number and email. The next step is Know Your Customer (KYC), a government-mandated procedure that requires the person to submit a soft copy of their identification documents with the exchange. A team verifies these documents before giving access to the applicant. KYC regulations aim to prevent financial crimes such as identity theft and money laundering.\n\nOne can buy Bitcoin via OTC or P2P trading on a centralized exchange. OTC trading has a minimum order size. For instance, CoinDCX has a minimum order size of 15,000 Tether (USDT) or 12,00,000 Indian rupees (whichever is lesser), while WazirX OTC Desk serves large crypto volumes worth $50,000 and above.\n\nOne may take the P2P route to buy BTC for lower denominations. The role of the exchange is to facilitate a direct deal between the buyer and the seller while acting as an escrow, ensuring nobody is at a loss. The exchange holds the money paid to the seller. Once the buyer receives BTC, the amount is transferred. The buyer can pay in fiat or any other cryptocurrency acceptable to the seller.\n\nHow to buy BTC on a decentralized crypto exchange in India\n\nAs the name suggests, a decentralized exchange (DEX) is designed to facilitate P2P transactions without any decisive role for a single person or a group of executives. Instead, based on the input provided by participants, a smart contract executes the transactions.\n\nDirect transactions between users on the blockchain eliminate any need for DEXs to act as intermediaries. As trades get executed on top of the blockchain network via a smart contract, every transaction incurs a fee along with the trading fee. This is, however, less than what one incurs on centralized exchanges. Unlike centralized exchanges, DEXs do not take custody of users\u2019 funds, so the end-user always controls their digital assets.\n\nTo execute a transaction on a DEX, one needs to connect their cryptocurrency wallet to the exchange. However, DEXs don\u2019t allow buying Bitcoin with fiat currency, so one needs to transfer another cryptocurrency for Bitcoin. Transactions can be conducted without fulfilling KYC requirements. While transactions on DEXs might be anonymous for now, they could be brought into the regulatory ecosystem as it evolves.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin via SIP in India\n\nA systematic investment plan is a disciplined approach to regularly invest a fixed amount in assets at predefined intervals. SIP allows one to keep buying Bitcoin consistently over a predefined period. SIPs have been a fundamental component of conventional market instruments, including stocks and mutual funds. Thanks to SIPs, investors can capitalize on market fluctuations while retaining their portfolios for a long time.\n\nTo invest in SIPs, one needs to download the app of a service provider offering SIPs, complete the registration and KYC procedures, and select the relevant option on the screen. The next step is to choose the coin one wants to invest in (in this case, BTC), set the day and frequency of the plan, and start the SIP.\n\nHow to make direct P2P crypto transactions in India\n\nTo conduct direct peer-to-peer crypto transactions, one can opt for either on-exchange or off-exchange methods. On-exchange transactions involve using a P2P service on a crypto exchange platform where users register, complete identity verification (KYC), and then browse and initiate transactions with other users. The platform holds the cryptocurrency in escrow until both parties confirm the transaction.\n\nOff-exchange or OTC transactions require finding a trusted buyer or seller, often through personal networks or OTC brokers, and directly agreeing on transaction terms. Payment is usually made via bank transfer or digital wallets, and the cryptocurrency is transferred directly to the receiver\u2019s wallet. In both methods, it\u2019s important to prioritize security and adhere to local regulations.\n\nDirect P2P cryptocurrency transactions can be conducted through the exchanges that facilitate the buying and selling of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly between individuals, offering various payment options, including bank transfers and online wallets.\n\nThey typically charge low trading fees, provide noncustodial wallets, and use escrow services to enhance security. With features like auto-matching and multiple payment methods, these exchanges cater to diverse needs while ensuring user safety and minimizing the risk of fraud and hacks in the P2P crypto market.\n\nModes of payment for cryptocurrency transactions in India\n\nCrypto exchanges in India allow one to transfer money using bank transfer (debit card or credit card) via Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and Unified Payments Interface (UPI). When conducting P2P trading, the seller might take payments in any mode they prefer, along with regular IMPS and UPI. These modes include regular Paytm, a digital payment service, and Lightning UPI, fast real-time transactions on Paytm with a single click without a PIN.\n\nOne can also pay for BTC using other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether (ETH), Polkadot\u2019s DOT (DOT) and Cardano (ADA), though many sellers prefer using stablecoins, such as USDT and USD Coin (USDC). However, buying Bitcoin via PayPal is not supported in India yet.\n\nMethods to store Bitcoin\n\nAfter buying Bitcoin, the next step is to store it securely. One can choose from several types of Bitcoin wallets, such as desktop wallets, mobile wallets, online wallets, hardware wallets and paper wallets. Many buyers leave their Bitcoin with the exchange, which may not be suitable because the exchange holds the cryptocurrency and not the buyer.\n\nHardware wallets and paper wallets store Bitcoin offline, making it safe from thieves, though one still has to be careful not to lose the private key or the paper wallet itself. Mobile wallets have the advantage of convenience, and one can carry their BTC around and use it the way they want at any time. Desktop and online wallets typically offer a level of security comparable to keeping Bitcoin on an exchange.\n\nWallets can also be categorized as custodial or noncustodial. When storing funds in custodial wallets, users have no control over their private keys, and funds lie in the custody of a third party. In contrast, noncustodial wallets give users complete control over their private keys and, subsequently, their funds.\n\nBitcoin regulations in India\n\nIndian law requires anyone who has made gains from trading virtual digital assets (VDAs), including Bitcoin, to pay tax at a rate of 30% plus 4% cess, a tax levied on the tax for spending on a specific purpose. When buying Bitcoin on an Indian exchange, the onus to ensure compliance is on the exchange.\n\nHowever, when buying BTC on an international exchange or conducting a P2P transaction where BTC exchanges hands, the buyer and seller must ascertain that compliance requirements are met.\n\nShould you buy Bitcoin in India?\n\nAlthough purchasing Bitcoin in India presents possible investment prospects, careful thought must be given. Regulatory uncertainties exist despite the legality of cryptocurrencies. Decision-making is impacted by variables such as market volatility, a lack of detailed guidelines and prospective policy changes.\n\nAccessibility via exchanges that facilitate rupee transfers is a benefit; however, there are still restrictions on some payment options. It\u2019s critical to assess one\u2019s own risk tolerance, comprehend market dynamics, and stay current on regulatory changes.\n\nEven though Bitcoin offers opportunities for investing, careful consideration and knowledge of India\u2019s changing cryptocurrency scene are necessary before making any decisions.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision."

        "title": "How To Invest In Bitcoin In 2024 - The College Investor",
        "content": "Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has rocketed in value from less than $1 per Bitcoin to a high of $69,000. And even when everyone thought bitcoin and crypto were dead, it rallied again in 2023. With such astronomical gains and rising concerns over the fiat banking system, it\u2019s no surprise that many investors still have their eyes on Bitcoin and other digital currencies in 2024. Whether you want to support Bitcoin\u2019s vision of decentralized finance, or simply are looking to diversify your portfolio with a powerful and promising asset, we\u2019re here to help you in your investment journey. Let\u2019s talk about 3 ways you can invest in Bitcoin right now, and how it's easier than ever before.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown individual or group of individuals under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It is the first decentralized currency that operates without a central bank or single administrator, making it a peer-to-peer electronic currency system. The history of Bitcoin began with the publication of a white paper titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\" in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. The paper outlined the design and implementation of a decentralized digital currency that would operate on a blockchain, a distributed ledger technology that allows for secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries. The first Bitcoin transaction occurred on January 12, 2009, when Satoshi Nakamoto sent 10 bitcoins to Hal Finney, a computer programmer and one of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin. Over time, more people began to adopt Bitcoin as a means of payment and investment, leading to its growth in popularity and value. In 2010, the first Bitcoin exchange, BitcoinMarket.com, was launched, enabling users to trade Bitcoin for fiat currencies like the US dollar. In the same year, the first Bitcoin ATM was also introduced in Vancouver, Canada, making it easier for people to buy and sell Bitcoin. Since then, Bitcoin has undergone several significant events, such as the 2011 hack of the Mt. Gox exchange, which resulted in the loss of approximately 850,000 bitcoins. Despite this setback, Bitcoin continued to grow, with more merchants accepting it as a means of payment. In 2013, the price of Bitcoin reached a high of $1,242, driven by increased interest from investors and the media. However, the price subsequently crashed, leading to a prolonged bear market that lasted until 2017. In 2017, Bitcoin experienced another price surge, reaching a high of nearly $20,000 in December of that year. This was driven by increased demand from investors and speculators, as well as the launch of Bitcoin futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). Bitcoin reached it all-time high (as of this writing) in 2021, hitting $68,789. However, it has since fallen off significantly. But even near the end of 2023, it's back over $43,000.\n\nSince then, Bitcoin has continued to experience volatility in its price, but it has also gained wider acceptance as a means of payment and investment. Several major companies, such as Tesla and Square, have invested in Bitcoin, and more merchants are accepting it as a means of payment. In fact, Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has said, \"Bitcoin is a digital store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a payment system with low transaction fees.\" Bitcoin has come a long way since its inception in 2009. It has gone from a digital currency with little value to a widely accepted means of payment and investment. Its history has been marked by significant events, both positive and negative, that have shaped its growth and adoption. However, despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown resilience and has continued to attract interest from investors and the wider public.\n\nInvest In Bitcoin Through Cryptocurrency Exchanges Cryptocurrency exchanges are online platforms that allow users to buy and sell various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. These exchanges provide a convenient way for investors to purchase and store Bitcoin, and offer a range of trading features and tools to help users manage their investments. If you\u2019re just getting started in your investment journey, or simply don\u2019t have the time to delve into more intense investing methods, using an exchange may be best for you. It's an easy \"on ramp\" to start investing in crypto, as it works very similar to what you'll find at traditional brokerage firms like Fidelity. Here are 4 quick steps you can take to invest in Bitcoin through an exchange:\n\n1. Open an account at an exchange of your choosing The first step is to open an exchange. Your options will vary by country, and while every exchange supports Bitcoin, if you want to invest in other cryptocurrencies in the future, make sure they are offered on your exchange. You can see some of our top picks for best crypto exchanges here. Note: Many exchanges require you to submit some form of ID to comply with anti-money laundering laws.\n\n2. Deposit fiat currency Next, you need to deposit your \"fiat\" currency. Fiat means money like dollar bills, Pounds, Euros, etc. Most platforms let you start with as little as $10, letting you deposit through bank transfers, credit/debit cards, or electronic wallets such as PayPal.\n\n3. Search for BTC With your newly funded account, use your exchange\u2019s search feature to find \u201cBTC\u201d, the ticker symbol for Bitcoin. Most platforms also offer a variety of other cryptocurrencies to invest in, such as popular altcoins like Doge, Solana, Ethereum, and XRP.\n\n4. Invest Using the exchange\u2019s trading function, purchase your desired amount of Bitcoin. Consider strategies such as dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) \u2013 which means purchasing a set amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals, regardless of price. Once your trade goes through, you\u2019re now a proud Bitcoin holder. Congratulations! Of course, exchanges aren\u2019t the only way to invest.\n\nBitcoin Investment Funds Bitcoin investment funds are a great way to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without having to purchase and store it yourself. These funds are managed by professionals who invest in Bitcoin on behalf of their clients, with the goal of generating returns that outperform the overall market. It's important to note that these funds invest via \"contracts\" or \"futures\", so they price may not actually reflect the exact price of Bitcoin. Also, the movement of the fund may not directly correlate as well. Here's a comparison of BTC vs. GBTC (a fund) over the last 5 years.\n\n1. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Bitcoin ETFs are funds that are traded on exchanges like traditional stocks. These funds track the price of Bitcoin, providing investors with exposure to the cryptocurrency market. ETFs can be bought and sold easily, and their prices fluctuate throughout the trading day. Bitcoin ETFs can be attractive to investors already familiar with stock market investing and prefer to have a diversified portfolio of stocks and cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Bitcoin ETFs may be suitable for investors who are looking for a way to invest in Bitcoin that is regulated by financial authorities, as ETFs are subject to regulatory oversight. There are several ETFs on the marketplace: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO)\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF)\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF) You can also short Bitcoin with ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF (BITI).\n\n2. Bitcoin Trusts And Mutual Funds These funds are managed by investment professionals who make decisions about which assets to invest in, and when to buy or sell them. Trusts, such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Osprey Bitcoin Trust, and others hold Bitcoin as their underlying asset. This allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's potential returns without actually owning the cryptocurrency itself. The trust's shares are traded on over-the-counter (OTC) markets, making them accessible to retail investors who may not have access to cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nBenefits Of Bitcoin Funds Diversification: Investing in a Bitcoin fund can diversify an investor's portfolio, as the fund may invest in other assets in addition to Bitcoin.\n\nInvesting in a Bitcoin fund can diversify an investor's portfolio, as the fund may invest in other assets in addition to Bitcoin. Professional Management: Bitcoin funds are managed by experienced financial professionals with expertise in cryptocurrency markets.\n\nBitcoin funds are managed by experienced financial professionals with expertise in cryptocurrency markets. Accessibility: Investing in a Bitcoin fund is typically easier and more convenient than purchasing and storing Bitcoin yourself.\n\nRisks Of Bitcoin Funds Volatility: Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and investing in a Bitcoin fund can expose investors to significant price fluctuations. Even with professional management, it\u2019s important to remember that there is always the risk of losing funds.\n\nBitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and investing in a Bitcoin fund can expose investors to significant price fluctuations. Even with professional management, it\u2019s important to remember that there is always the risk of losing funds. Fees: Bitcoin funds charge fees for management and administration, which can eat into returns. Overall, investment funds might be a good choice if you value a hands-off strategy and the assurance that your money is in professional hands. Given the unique nature of investment funds, it\u2019s always recommended to do as much research as possible before investing. However, if you prefer to maintain ownership of your assets (or just want to invest long-term without worrying about fees) then you may want to consider a third option: Self-custody.\n\nHow To Use And Invest In Bitcoin Via Self-Custody One major disadvantage to holding Bitcoin on an exchange or with an investment fund is that there is always the risk of dealing mismanagement by the custodian. And since exchanges often are not insured like banks, losses due to external factors may not always be recoverable. Just look at Celsius, BlockFi, and others. That's why you may have heard the phrase \"not your keys, not your crypto\". Basically, if you don't own your crypto via self-custody, you don't truly own your crypto. Crypto self-custody means you have complete control over your funds. Sending, receiving, and storing your Bitcoin and digital currencies are all done without any third-party involvement. In a sense, you are your own bank. Of course, it's important to note that self-custody requires a certain level of technical knowledge and responsibility, as there are risks involved in managing your own private keys. But if you\u2019re looking for maximum control and security over your investments, here are 4 steps to get you started on the path of self-custody.\n\n1. Get a wallet There are lots of Bitcoin wallets to choose from, including desktop, mobile, and hardware wallets. Each has its own benefits and drawbacks in terms of security, accessibility, and ease of use. So you'll want to research and compare options to find one that best fits your needs. We recommend that you get a hardware wallet for the most security. You can see some of our top picks of cryptocurrency wallets here.\n\n2. Setup your Bitcoin wallet Once you've chosen a wallet, you'll need to download and install it on your device or hardware. You'll also need to create a strong password and back up your wallet's seed phrase, a series of randomly-generated words used to recover your wallet in case of loss or damage. It\u2019s very important you store your seed phrase in a safe location. It\u2019s estimated that some 3 million BTC have been lost, in many cases due to users being unable to access them. NEVER SHARE YOUR SEED PHRASE And ideally, never type your seed phrase into a computer, and never take a picture of it.\n\n3. Purchase Bitcoin The annoying part is you cannot simply buy Bitcoin using a self-custody wallet. If you're mining Bitcoin, or receiving it as payment, you can use this directly. But, you still need an exchange if you're going to be using fiat currency. So, pick your favorite exchange above to make the initial purchase, and then you can transfer your Bitcoin. Once you\u2019ve set up your wallet, you\u2019ll be given a unique Bitcoin address (a long series of letters and numbers) or a QR code that links to the wallet. Using this, you can transfer Bitcoin from an exchange to your self custody wallet.\n\n4. Secure your Bitcoin After you've purchased your Bitcoin, you'll want to ensure that it\u2019s securely stored. Depending on your wallet, this may involve additional steps such as enabling two-factor authentication. For maximum security, we recommend a hardware wallet over software wallets. Also, try to avoid text message (SMS) two-factor authentication. This can be hacked easily. Instead, use an app-based authenticator like Authy.\n\n4 Different Bitcoin Investing Strategies Now that you know how to buy it logistically, what type of Bitcoin investing strategies are there? Here are the four major ways to invest in bitcoin strategically. 1. Buy And Hold The buy and hold strategy is the simplest and most popular strategy for investing in Bitcoin. The idea behind this strategy is to buy Bitcoin and hold it for the long term, with the expectation that its value will increase over time. This strategy is based on the assumption that Bitcoin will become more widely accepted as a means of payment and investment, leading to an increase in demand and value.\n\nPros Header Cons Header The buy and hold strategy is simple and easy to implement. The buy and hold strategy is not suitable for short-term investors or those looking for quick returns. It allows investors to benefit from long-term growth and appreciation in the value of Bitcoin. Bitcoin's value can be volatile and subject to sudden fluctuations, which can lead to significant losses for investors.\n\n2. Dollar Cost Averaging The dollar-cost averaging strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money in Bitcoin at regular intervals, regardless of its price. For example, an investor may choose to invest $100 in Bitcoin every month, regardless of whether its price has gone up or down. There are new tools like the Soon App that can help with this.\n\nPros Header Cons Header The dollar-cost averaging strategy can help investors avoid the volatility and risk of trying to time the market. The dollar-cost averaging strategy may not be suitable for investors looking for quick returns or those who believe that Bitcoin's price is likely to increase significantly in the short term. It can also help investors build a position in Bitcoin over time, without having to make a large upfront investment. The strategy may also result in missed opportunities if Bitcoin's price suddenly spikes.\n\n3. Trading Strategy The trading strategy involves buying and selling Bitcoin based on its price movements. Traders will often use technical analysis to identify patterns and trends in Bitcoin's price, in order to make informed decisions about when to buy or sell.\n\nPros Header Cons Header The trading strategy can allow investors to take advantage of short-term price movements and generate quick returns. Trading requires a significant amount of skill and knowledge, and can be very time-consuming. It can also help investors manage risk by setting stop-loss orders or other risk management tools. It also involves a high level of risk, as Bitcoin's price can be unpredictable and subject to sudden fluctuations.\n\n4. Bitcoin Mining Strategy The mining strategy involves using computing power to validate transactions on the Bitcoin network and earn rewards in the form of newly minted Bitcoin. This strategy requires a significant investment in hardware and electricity, and is typically only viable for large-scale operations.\n\nPros Header Cons Header The mining strategy can provide investors with a steady stream of newly minted Bitcoin, which can be used for investment or other purposes. The mining strategy requires a significant upfront investment in hardware and electricity, which can be expensive and time-consuming. It can also help investors support the Bitcoin network and its decentralized architecture. The profitability of mining can be affected by factors such as Bitcoin's price, network difficulty, and the cost of electricity."

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Price Climb To $47,000? Here\u2019s What This Crypto Analyst Thinks - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The bulls seem to be back in control following the return of the Bitcoin price to above $43,000 this past week. This positive run comes on the back of a period where the premier cryptocurrency struggled, falling below $41,000 at some point.\n\nHowever, the market leader appears to have regained most of its lost momentum, with new heights now in sight. A popular crypto pundit on the X platform has put forward a new prognosis and set a new target for the Bitcoin price.\n\nBTC Price To $47,000? Here\u2019s What Needs To Happen\n\nIn a post on X, crypto analyst Ali Martinez offered insight into the price action of Bitcoin, explaining the potential movements of the cryptocurrency over the coming weeks. This evaluation is based on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) data by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode.\n\nA chart showing the UTXO Realized Price Distribution of Bitcoin | Source: Ali_charts/X\n\nMartinez identified the $43,200 area as a crucial support level, which can potentially determine the fate of Bitcoin\u2019s price. The premier cryptocurrency broke above this price zone on Wednesday, December 20, and has been trading mostly sideways since.\n\nIn his post, Martinez highlighted that so long as the vital $43,200 support holds, the momentum is with the Bitcoin bulls. According to the crypto analyst, staying above this support is one catalyst that could push the Bitcoin price to above $47,360.\n\nOn the flip side of his analysis, he noted that the Bitcoin price could possibly undergo a correction. The crypto pundit emphasized that one of the bearish signals to watch out for is a sustained close below the crucial $43,200 mark.\n\nAccording to Martinez\u2019s projection, a close below $43,200 could send the price of BTC down towards $37,000. This would mean a decline of over 15% from the current price point.\n\nBitcoin Price Overview\n\nAs of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at $43,783, reflecting a mere 0.5% gain in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, though, the premier cryptocurrency has shown tremendous recovery to return back to its heights of early January.\n\nAccording to data from CoinGecko, the value of BTC is up by more than 4.5% in the past seven days. Meanwhile, the coin\u2019s price has surged by nearly 16% in December as the market leader looks to close out the year on a high.\n\nBitcoin continues to maintain its position as the largest cryptocurrency in the sector, with a market cap of roughly $858 billion.\n\nBTC price experiences correction at $44,000 on the daily timeframe | Source: BTCUSDT chart on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin Jumped Over 160% This Year. Is the Crypto Winter Over? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "This time last year, crypto investors wondered if the bleak winter would ever come to an end. FTX, a popular crypto platform, had just collapsed and Bitcoin (BTC) had erased most of the gains of the previous few years. Some wondered if the emerging crypto market could ever recover.\n\nToday tells a different story. The granddaddy of crypto has soared over 160% since the start of the year. According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin opened at around $16,540 on Jan. 1, and at time of writing it was worth almost $44,000.\n\nIs the crypto winter over?\n\nThere's a sense of cautious optimism about Bitcoin and crypto right now. It has crept upwards in spite of economic uncertainty and heavy regulatory headwinds. Bitcoin's price hasn't reached the highs we saw in November 2021, but it has demonstrated a certain resilience. The crypto fear and greed index, which measures market sentiment, has been in greed territory for over a month now.\n\nOne of the big driving factors behind Bitcoin's recent rally is the hope that the SEC might approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2024. Up to now, the SEC has steadfastly refused to greenlight spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, many observers think next year will bring a change of heart.\n\nEarlier this year, an appeals court ruled that the SEC didn't have grounds to say no to the EFT proposals. The SEC didn't appeal the judgment, which fueled speculation that it may now give the go-ahead to one (or several) of the applications in the pipeline.\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF could significantly change the crypto landscape. Investors would no longer need to buy Bitcoin from a crypto exchange. Instead, they could use their brokerage account to buy shares in an ETF that owns Bitcoin. It would make it much easier for both retail and institutional inventors to hold the leading crypto.\n\nOur top crypto play isn't a token - Here\u2019s why We\u2019ve found one company that\u2019s positioned itself perfectly as a long-term picks-and-shovels solution for the broader crypto market \u2014 Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and all the others.

Get started\n\nIs it safe to buy Bitcoin in 2024?\n\nDuring the crypto frenzy of 2020 and 2021, many Americans bought crypto for the first time. The soaring prices created a sense that the market could only go upward. Speculation was rife. Sadly, many retail investors lost money in the subsequent crash, which saw Bitcoin lose around half its value in six months.\n\nIf you're wondering whether it will be safe to buy Bitcoin in 2024, the short answer is that cryptocurrency is a risky asset class. It is still a relatively new and unregulated industry, and there is a lot we don't know about how it will unfold. Here are some questions to consider:\n\nAre you comfortable with the volatility? Bitcoin's price fluctuates dramatically. It gained over 300% in 2020, gained another 60% in 2021, only to lose 65% in 2022. It isn't uncommon for Bitcoin's price to move by 20% in a matter of days, which can be difficult for some investors to stomach.\n\nBitcoin's price fluctuates dramatically.

Cryptocurrency exchanges don't carry the same protections as a bank or brokerage account. How does crypto fit with the rest of your portfolio? There are many different investments to choose from, so try to make sure crypto only makes up a small percentage of your portfolio. That way you'll benefit if Bitcoin goes to the moon, but your wealth-building plans won't be destroyed if it doesn't succeed.\n\nThere are many different investments to choose from, so try to make sure crypto only makes up a small percentage of your portfolio.

Short-term speculation rarely pays off, so try to understand Bitcoin's long-term potential use cases. Some people argue that Bitcoin could become the native currency of the internet. Others think it could take a portion of the global remittance market or become a currency for emerging markets. Critics believe it has no inherent value at all.\n\nShort-term speculation rarely pays off, so try to understand Bitcoin's long-term potential use cases. Some people argue that Bitcoin could become the native currency of the internet. Others think it could take a portion of the global remittance market or become a currency for emerging markets. Critics believe it has no inherent value at all. Are you comfortable with crypto's regulatory situation? Most cryptocurrencies are currently viewed as commodities and come under the purview of the CFTC. The SEC has brought charges against several top crypto exchanges this year, making the case that many cryptos are actually unregistered securities. At the same time, at some point the government is likely to introduce a regulatory framework for crypto. But right now there's a lot of noise and not a lot of certainty, which some investors find concerning.\n\nSpeaking personally, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to make up a small percentage of my wider investments. However, I am concerned by the regulatory landscape and the questions about what goes on (or has gone on) behind the scenes at various crypto platforms. Bitcoin's price may have recovered from the collapse of FTX, but for me, the stain of the fraud and extreme mismanagement remains.\n\nKey takeaway\n\nBitcoin's 150% rally in 2023 is great news for crypto investors. But don't assume that the end of the crypto winter means it is safe to enter the crypto waters. Bitcoin still has many significant hurdles to cross. These include a changing regulatory landscape, bruised investor confidence, and questions about its utility. Do your research before you jump in."

However, the deepest correction in 2023 closed just -20% below the local high, suggesting that buy-side support, and the overall supply and demand balance has been favourable all year.\u201d\n\nBitcoin bull market corrections annotated chart (screenshot). Source: Glassnode\n\nThat \u201cfavorable\u201d climate has led all Bitcoin investor cohorts back to aggregate profitability, yet as Glassnode notes, this is not so high as to spark mass selling and risk an uptrend breakdown.\n\nExamining the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric, researchers showed that profitability currently echoes mid-2019, when Bitcoin saw a mid-cycle high.\n\n\u201cThe NUPL metric for each cohort is not yet at euphoric highs, but is also comfortably above the respective cohort break-even level,\u201d they summarized.\n\nBitcoin NUPL annotated chart (screenshot).

Months of U.S. data have fed the narrative of declining inflation with barely any exceptions.\n\nNow, the Federal Reserve faces the question of when to begin unwinding interest rate hikes \u2014 a move known as a \u201cpivot\u201d \u2014 and how fast.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, bets on the move\u2019s timing include as early as next month, while the Fed itself has played down such odds.\n\nPer data from CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, markets remain unconvinced that officials will lower rates at the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, on Jan. 31.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart.

My buy was so bad, that the extra Coinbase fee applied for AUD at the time put my bid above the top tick of the top candle.\n\n\n\nMy pain hardly compares to that of miners.\n\n\n\nSince 2017, mining Difficulty is up 4,130%, and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/vN5edmMXuf \u2014 _Check\u0271ate \u26a1\u2622\ufe0f\ufe0f (@_Checkmatey_) December 23, 2023\n\nGreedy for gains this Christmas\n\nDespite the slower pace of BTC price gains toward the end of the year, the average investor is increasingly guided by a sense of greed.\n\nRelated: Price analysis 12/22: BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, ADA, AVAX, DOGE, DOT, LINK\n\nThis is the final conclusion of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, the popular sentiment gauge that looks set to round out 2023 at levels seen during Bitcoin\u2019s $69,000 all-time high two years ago.\n\nAt 73/100 as of Dec. 25, the Index, which uses a basket of factors to compute the average mindset across the crypto investor base, is firmly in its \u201cgreed\u201d bracket.\n\nCrypto Fear & Greed Index (screenshot).

Some of the attendees at those meetings included representatives from BlackRock, Grayscale Investments, ARK Invest and 21 Shares.\n\nThe meetings also reportedly featured representatives of the exchanges that would potentially list the new products, including Nasdaq and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, as well as lawyers and issuers.\n\nRegulators reportedly told attendees at the meetings that any issuer that doesn\u2019t meet the Dec. 29 deadline will not be part of a first wave of potential spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in early January.\n\nFox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett was among the first to report on the deadline. Terrett subsequently confirmed the date for final amendments to all S-1s by Dec. 29.\n\n\u201cThe SEC told issuers that applications that are fully finished and filed by Friday will be considered in the first wave,\u201d the journalist wrote on X (formerly Twitter). She also stressed that the filings that mention in-kind creation will be rejected.\n\nConfirming the date for final amendments to all S-1s by Friday the 29th.

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the AP agreement will be the last hurdle on the way to spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cThis is no easy last step, and may keep some from starting gate. AP agreement + cash creates = approval,\u201d Balchunas wrote on X. As of Dec. 22, none of the spot Bitcoin ETF filers had the AP agreement in place, while seven firms switched the redemption model strictly to cash, according to Balchunas.\n\nDespite multiple firms moving forward with last-minute updates for their spot Bitcoin ETF filers, Bloomberg analysts are still confident that the SEC will have approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs by Jan. 10.\n\nMagazine: SEC delays Ether ETFs, Binance settlement approved and another court loss for SBF: Hodler\u2019s Digest, Dec. 17\u201323"
