        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The cryptocurrency fund manager Grayscale won a major court battle Tuesday against the Securities and Exchange Commission, paving the way for the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nGrayscale sued the SEC last year when the securities regulator denied its application to turn its bitcoin fund, known as GBTC, into an ETF. The ETF would be backed by bitcoin instead of bitcoin futures, according to Grayscale\u2019s application at the time.\n\nThe SEC rejected the company\u2019s application over concerns about investor protections and other issues. However, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals sided with Grayscale, handing the SEC another setback in its attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin jumped 8% Tuesday.\n\nETFs are a popular vehicle used to gain exposure to certain assets without directly investing in a commodity, or in a company\u2019s stock. ETFs track a desired index, sector or commodity, but they can be bought and sold like regular stocks.\n\nGrayscale had argued that a bitcoin ETF would be safer for investors because the bitcoin technology is not able to move as fast as stock-trading technologies.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic milestone for American investors, the bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d said Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein, in a prepared statement.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s win will likely lead to other fund managers preparing their own bitcoin or cryptocurrency ETFs in time. Both Fidelity and BlackRock have expressed interest in producing such products in the past."

        "title": "The Controversial Business of Cash-to-Crypto Bitcoin ATMs - Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City",
        "content": "Bitcoin ATMs, or \u201cBTMs,\u201d are a substantial industry in the United States. Despite the volatility of the cryptocurrency market and some controversy over potentially predatory or illicit uses, the cash-to-crypto BTM industry continues to experience consumer demand. However, data on the industry and its effects are sparse. This Payments System Research Briefing surveys the data available and reviews the industry\u2019s overall shape, size, and customer base in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow BTMs Work\n\nBTMs allow consumers to purchase, and sometimes sell, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. While all BTMs handle Bitcoin, many also handle cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin and Ether, as well as the stablecoins Tether and USDC. The standalone BTM machine resembles a traditional ATM and generates fees for the \u201coperator\u201d\u2014the individual, small business, or corporation that manages the BTM. BTMs are generally placed in locations with heavy foot traffic, long hours, and convenient in-and-out locations, such as convenience stores, gas stations, cafes, and supermarkets; locations that are relatively cheap to rent and offer privacy and accessibility are preferred (Coin ATM Radar 2015; ChainBytes Bitcoin ATM 2021; Chad Otsuji ATM Business 2021; Nordqvist 2022).\n\nAlthough the process of buying or selling Bitcoin at a BTM varies by machine, users follow some basic steps. First, the customer selects a purchase tier (such as $5\u2013$1,999 or $2,000\u2013$7,500). After providing the BTM with identification, such as a phone number, the customer enters the address of the digital wallet that will receive the Bitcoin purchased, usually using a QR code. If the customer prefers not to use a digital wallet, the BTM can create a paper wallet printed with the public and private cryptographic keys that allow access to the Bitcoin (again, usually via QR code). Finally, the customer feeds cash (or a debit card) into the machine and receives a receipt of the transaction. Selling Bitcoin at a BTM mostly follows the same procedure except that the address to send Bitcoin is that of the BTM operator, and cash is dispensed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics of U.S. BTM Users\n\nAbout 10 to 25 percent of U.S. adults hold or use cryptocurrency, and while some of these adults use BTMs, the exact number is unknown (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2023; Faverio and Sidoti 2023; Arkana and Li 2023; Wheat and Eckerd 2022). Based on their reasons for using BTMs, consumers generally fall into at least one of four groups (Thinking Crypto 2023; ChainBytes Bitcoin ATM 2021; Tompor 2018).\n\nCash users: People who prefer to transact in cash and may be unbanked or underbanked.\n\nOlder consumers: Older users who may not be as adept with current technology but are used to traditional ATMs. These users tend to prefer familiar, personal, and tangible experiences.\n\nPrivacy seekers: Users who want greater anonymity than is provided by a crypto exchange.\n\nConvenience-focused consumers: Users who want quick and easy transactions and are willing to pay a fee for this convenience.\n\nDemographically, most BTM users are male and almost evenly distributed across age groups, with a slight majority age 30 to 44 (Bitcoin Depot and GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. 2023). These characteristics are roughly in line with other studies on cryptocurrency users, though BTM users may skew older (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2023; Faverio and Sidoti 2023; Wheat and Eckerd 2022).\n\nAccording to one industry source, the vast majority of BTM users earn less than $80,000 per year (Bitcoin Depot and GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. 2023). Research reports from outside the BTM industry suggest that low- and middle-income consumers are in fact overrepresented among BTM users\u2014a characteristic that news articles also support (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2023; Faverio and Sidoti 2023; Wheat and Eckerd 2022; Peters 2020; Tompor 2018).\n\nNews articles also point to a significant proportion of BTM users belonging to minority groups (Peters 2020; Tompor 2018; Mika 2023). This finding appears consistent with research that consistently shows that minority groups are the biggest holders and users of cryptocurrency in general, with Asian users slightly outpacing Black and Hispanic users (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2023; Faverio and Sidoti 2023).\n\nA share of BTM users may also be immigrants. According to limited evidence from the BTM industry, a majority of users buy cryptocurrencies from BTMs to use in person-to-person transactions or remittances. Because many BTMs appear in immigrant neighborhoods in major cities, news reports also stress the role of BTMs in remittances (Luthi 2022; Ajiboye 2022; Mika 2023). One explanation for this usage may be that the cost of using cryptocurrency obtained from a BTM in a remittance may be comparable to the cost of sending a remittance via third parties using cash, when factoring in convenience, time savings, and transactional certainty and speed.\n\nAfter remittances, BTM users report using Bitcoin to an almost equal extent for investing or making online purchases. A minority of users also report using Bitcoin as a store of value or converting it into another form of cryptocurrency (Bitcoin Depot and GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. 2023). These reports are at odds with most research and news articles that show investment as the leading reason for buying or holding cryptocurrency among consumers overall (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2023; Arkana and Li 2023; Tompor 2018; Luthi 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the U.S. Bitcoin ATM Industry Operates\n\nCustomers pay high fees to use a BTM, on top of a possible exchange fee. The median fee for buying Bitcoin from a BTM, as self-reported by BTM operators in the United States, is 16 percent of the value of the transaction (Coin ATM Radar 2023). When selling Bitcoin, the median fee (again, self-reported) is 15 percent (Coin ATM Radar 2023). Sometimes added to these usage fees are unfavorable exchange rates derived from the operator charging above-market prices for the Bitcoin. Hearsay evidence puts exchange rate costs at between 5 and 7 percent of the value of the transaction (Knight 2023). In total, fees of 20 percent may not be uncommon.\n\nBecause the total cost of operating a BTM is estimated at only 3 to 6 percent of revenue, Bitcoin ATMs are a high-margin industry for operators (Wanna, Irrera, and Butt 2022). Operator costs can be roughly broken into \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d costs. The direct costs are the BTM machines, the rent for their locations, and the cryptocurrency transacted. BTMs are usually bought new or used, but they can also be rented. Operators must also maintain Bitcoin and cash balances to run their BTMs, usually by buying the Bitcoin from an over-the-counter dealer (Coin ATM Radar 2023; ChainBytes Bitcoin ATM 2021; Thinking Crypto 2023).\n\nThe main indirect or overhead cost of operating a BTM is regulatory compliance. BTMs are basically money services businesses and therefore are supposed to follow state and federal rules related to the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering (AML) rules (BitAML 2019; ChainBytes Bitcoin ATM 2021). Many BTM suppliers provide guides and documents to new BTM owners to manage compliance on their own. Large operators have their own staffs to handle regulatory compliance, and some third-party businesses do all AML work for smaller BTM operators._ However, many BTM operators do little or nothing to comply with existing regulations (PYMNTS 2022; Thomson Reuters 2022; State of New Jersey Commission of Investigation 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nSize of the U.S. Bitcoin ATM Industry\n\nThe lack of data makes it hard to determine the size of the Bitcoin ATM industry in the United States. However, the number of BTMs, the number of operators, and revenue can give a broad outline.\n\nThe total number of BTMs in use varies widely depending on the data source. For example, Coin ATM Radar reports 30,712 BTMs in operation as of July 2023. However, the website \u201cHow Many Bitcoin ATMs\u201d reports 67,962 BTMs as of January 2023. A very rough approximation of the number of BTMs may be the average of the two figures: 49,337 BTMs. (See the appendix for more information on these data.)\n\nData on the number of U.S. BTM operators are again scarce and probably inaccurate. \u201cHow Many Bitcoin ATMs\u201d reports only 19 operators. In contrast, Coin ATM Radar reports 220 operators; however, this number is still likely on the low side given that some operators do not record their presence on this website. The United States may have significantly more than 220 BTM operators, especially considering the potential for numerous small operators with just a few BTMs (Coin ATM Radar 2023).\n\nAgain, data on revenue in the BTM industry are sparse and questionable. Based on industry and news sources, the industry average for monthly income from a BTM in the United States ranges between $5,000 and $7,250, resulting in an average of $6,125 (see the appendix for the derivation of these monthly figures). Multiplying the monthly income average ($6,125) by the estimated number of BTMs (49,337) results in an average monthly income across the industry of $302,189,125\u2014an estimated annual revenue of $3.63 billion, though this is only an approximate figure. If the usual fee involved in a transaction is 16 percent, consumers buying and selling Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at BTMs must spend $22.69 billion in cash in a year to produce this annual industry revenue.\n\nThe rapid growth of the BTM industry in the United States was significantly affected by the 2022 \u201ccrypto winter,\u201d when cryptocurrency prices declined dramatically. Growth in the industry came to a halt, with some retrenchment before the number of BTMs stabilized (Wanna, Irrera, and Butt 2022). The operator of Coin Cloud ATMs, for example, filed for bankruptcy in early 2023, removing thousands of BTMs from use in the United States (CoinCodeCap 2023).\n\nNevertheless, some BTM operators are expanding, notably Bitcoin Depot, which became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ in July 2023, with a market cap of around $45 million. In early 2023, Bitcoin Depot started a partnership with convenience store chain GetGo to install BTMs in its stores (Dworski 2023). At the same time, Coinhub entered into agreements with gas stations and convenience stores to host its BTMs (Coinhub Bitcoin ATM 2023). By mid-2023, the overall number of BTMs began to grow again (Sarkar 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks of Bitcoin ATMs\n\nThe BTM industry has been charged repeatedly with predatory and illicit behavior, gaining a reputation that may eventually affect consumer use as well as future regulation. BTM operators have already formed the Cryptocurrency Compliance Cooperative to get ahead of potential conflicts with regulators and law enforcement (Partz 2021).\n\nThe industry is most often charged with \u201cpredatory inclusion,\u201d or disguising high-risk, high-cost services as ways for the financially disadvantaged to gain entry to lucrative financial investments. Some argue that BTMs are marketed to the unbanked, low-income, and migrant communities, consumers who tend to use cash more often. Further, cryptocurrencies are marketed as an investment that can be purchased without a broker or bank account, with effectively no minimum dollar amount, and with the potential for large returns. However, the volatility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and the transaction fees involved are not clearly presented (Tompor 2018; Knight 2023; Peters 2020; Luthi 2022; U.S. Department of the Treasury 2022; Mika 2023).\n\nLaw enforcement have received reports of scam victims being directed to send money to scammers through BTMs. Victims are usually sent a QR code (the scammer\u2019s digital wallet address) and directed to go to a BTM, convert cash into cryptocurrency, and send it to the address provided. These funds are unrecoverable. Chainalysis reports that BTMs are the source of around 1 percent of payments by scam victims, reaching over $35 million in 2022 (TRM 2023; U.S. Department of the Treasury 2022; FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center 2021; Chainalysis 2023).\n\nAccording to one report, BTMs are the most common way to launder money, with an individual BTM operator able to process tens of millions of dollars in dirty cash (TRM 2023). The relative anonymity of transactions, along with the speed, convenience, and irreversibility of the cash-to-crypto conversion make BTMs ideal for money launderers. Cash from illicit activities is converted into cryptocurrency and sent to a wallet that serves as an off-ramp for the illicit funds via an online exchange (TRM 2023; Thomson Reuters 2022; State of New Jersey Commission of Investigation 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe multi-billion-dollar U.S. BTM industry, built on a cash-to-crypto service, continues to grow, with the number of BTMs increasing after the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d retrenchment. Despite high fees attached to BTMs, consumers seem likely to use them\u2014perhaps for remittances, investment, or both.\n\nGrowth in the industry should not obscure charges of predatory and illicit behavior. Given the size of the Bitcoin ATM industry in the United States, the losses to uneducated crypto investors using BTMs to purchase volatile cryptocurrencies could be substantial. Further, the industry\u2019s role in facilitating money laundering and scams may pose significant risks to the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix: Notes on U.S. BTM Industry Data and Calculations\n\nNumber of BTMs\n\nOnly two sources exist for nationwide data on BTMs, and both have some reliability issues. The website \u201cCoin ATM Radar\u201d covers many aspects of the U.S. BTM industry, but all data on the site are self-reported by operators, who get exposure and free marketing for their businesses. Data are not comprehensive, as some large operators and perhaps many small BTM operators do not report to the website.\n\nThe other source of data on the U.S. BTM industry is \u201cHow Many Bitcoin ATMs,\u201d a website run by an anonymous group of researchers who use \u201ccompany websites and official directories\u201d as their sources. These data sources appear to leave out large BTM operators that appear on Coin ATM Radar. Further obscuring the data on \u201cHow Many Bitcoin ATMs\u201d is whether a Bitcoin ATM is defined as a BTM, as a retailer providing an over-the-counter service, or both. The potential inclusion of non-BTM operations likely inflates the number provided.\n\n\n\nTotal Revenue\n\nGiven sparse and questionable revenue data, perhaps the best way to get a sense of the industry\u2019s overall revenue is by first estimating the revenue per BTM and then combining it with the number of BTMs we estimate. For this, we use information from the publicly traded Bitcoin Depot and estimates put forth by other sources to try to determine the revenue per BTM.\n\nVarious sources have put the estimated monthly revenue of a BTM as between $1,000 and $10,000, depending on use and transaction volume (ChainBytes Bitcoin ATM 2021; Wanna, Irrera, and Butt 2022). This gives a midpoint monthly revenue per BTM of $5,000.\n\nIf we assume that a Bitcoin Depot BTM earns at an industry average (a big assumption), we may be able to get a more focused number. Using their 2021 revenue of $548,980,000 and an estimated 6,300 BTMs in the United States, we calculate the average monthly income per BTM was $7,262 (Yahoo! Finance 2023; Bitcoin Depot and GSR II Meteora Acquisition Corp. 2023; Bitcoin Depot 2021)."

        "content": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nThe value of crypto assets surged Tuesday after a US court cleared a path for the nation\u2019s first bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe ruling is a breakthrough moment for crypto investors and a setback for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been trying to rein in the digital asset industry.\n\nThe three-judge panel for the DC Court of Appeals overruled an SEC decision denying Grayscale Invesments permission to launch a bitcoin-focused ETF. The panel said the regulator had failed to adequately explain why it rejected the firm\u2019s application.\n\n\u201cThe denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products,\u201d Judge Neomi Rao wrote.\n\nAn SEC spokesperson said Tuesday the agency was \u201creviewing the court\u2019s decision to determine next steps.\u201d\n\nMajor crypto tokens surged on the news. Bitcoin prices, which have been especially volatile in recent weeks, were up 7% to nearly $28,000. Coinbase (COIN), the largest publicly traded US crypto exchange, jumped 15%.\n\nThe bitcoin fund at the center of the case, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, was up 17%.\n\nGrayscale had argued that is proposal was materially similar to other bitcoin investment products that the SEC has already approved.

        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nWhich investment option is right for you depends on your risk tolerance, strategy and timeline. /Getty Images\n\nIn recent years, both gold and Bitcoin have become popular investment options. While gold has for centuries been a traditional go-to investment, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have gained traction among investors looking to cash in on the latest trends.\n\nWhich is right for you? The answer depends on your investment strategy and preferences.\n\nLearn more about gold investing with a free information kit.\n\nGold vs. Bitcoin: Which is a better investment?\n\nTo determine whether gold or Bitcoin is the better investment for you, you must first understand how the two compare.\n\nGold\n\nGold offers several perks, as well as a few downsides.\n\nPros\n\nGold has been a trusted investment for centuries. It's recognized as a safe haven in times of economic crisis and is widely considered a hedge against inflation.\n\nGold's value is not tied to any governmental or economic system. In fact, when financial turmoil causes stock prices to drop and currency to weaken, gold prices often increase, making it a great way to protect your portfolio from losses.\n\nFinally, gold is rare. There is a limited supply of it, and we cannot produce more when it runs out. And since gold is used in everything from jewelry to electronics, it is always in demand. While prices might fluctuate in the short term, they tend to remain relatively stable over time. This makes gold a solid long-term investment that can provide you with peace of mind and safeguard your portfolio.\n\nCons\n\nDespite its benefits, gold does have downsides. While it generates steady returns, these returns are typically modest, making gold better for wealth preservation than wealth generation. You shouldn't keep more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in gold so you have room for other assets, such as stocks, to create bigger returns.\n\nIn addition, if you choose to invest in physical gold, you must store is securely and insure it, which adds to your costs.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBitcoin is a relatively new investment option that's wildly popular among tech enthusiasts and trend-watchers. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency (known as cryptocurrency) that operates independently of central banks and is powered by blockchain technology. It also has its perks and downsides.\n\nPros\n\nOne of Bitcoin's biggest attractions is the possibility to generate large returns quickly. While gold has been a stable investment over time, Bitcoin has skyrocketed in value \u2014 at times, precipitously. For example, in January 2019, 1 Bitcoin was worth about $3,800. By November 2021, it was worth up to over $60,000.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin is purely digital. It has no physical form and is bought and sold electronically on a variety of platforms and exchanges. This makes Bitcoin transactions fast and straightforward, which can be appealing to investors.\n\nStart exploring your gold investment options \u2014 request your free investors kit today!\n\nCons\n\nHowever, with the potential for huge rewards comes the potential for huge losses. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, with sharp upswings and downswings, and timing is everything. And, it can be hard to predict where prices are heading. For investors who prefer a known commodity with a long track record to rely on, gold is the safer bet.\n\nIn addition, many investors are hesitant to invest in Bitcoin due to its relative newness. It isn't widely accepted as a currency, and you must learn some confusing jargon to understand it. Plus, the lack of regulation makes it ripe for scams. And even if your account remains secure, you can lose everything if you misplace your digital wallet or private key.\n\nWhich investment is better?\n\nWhen it comes to deciding between gold and Bitcoin, you must weigh the pros and cons of each. Which is better for you depends on your risk tolerance, investment goals and preferences.\n\nGold is generally best suited for investors who prioritize stability and are focused on long-term goals. It doesn't require constantly monitoring the news or engaging in risky speculation.\n\nBitcoin is better for investors willing to take on a high level of risk for potentially high returns. If you like the thrill of trying to time the market and you can comfortably afford to lose a large amount if you time it wrong, Bitcoin might be worth considering.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nGold and Bitcoin offer different benefits and drawbacks. Bitcoin is a more volatile investment that may provide quick returns, while gold is relatively stable but has limited growth potential. Understanding each investment's pros and cons is necessary to decide which is better for you. Ultimately, it comes down to your risk tolerance, goals and investment timeline.\n\nRegardless of which option you choose, it's essential to do your research and keep your overall investment strategy in mind. When in doubt, a financial advisor can help you."

The company decided to pursue the ETF, which would be backed by bitcoin rather than bitcoin derivatives, after the SEC approved ProShares' futures-based bitcoin ETF in October 2021.\n\nThe ruling faced multiple delays but the SEC ultimately rejected the application last summer, citing failure by Grayscale to answer questions related to concerns about possible market manipulation and investor protections.\n\n\"We are reviewing the court's decision to determine next steps,\" the SEC said in a statement.\n\nA spokeswoman for Grayscale called Tuesday's ruling \"a monumental step forward for American investors, the Bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for Bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper.\"\n\n\"The Grayscale team and our legal advisors are actively reviewing the details outlined in the Court's opinion and will be pursuing next steps with the SEC. We will share more information as soon as practicable,\" continued the written statement."

        "content": "The price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency jumped 6% on Tuesday after a federal judge issued a long anticipated decision regarding the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s denial of Grayscale\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWithin less than an hour, Bitcoin rose from just above $26,000 to more than $27,600 at its height. At the time of publication, the price was hovering just under $27,500.\n\nThe total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies, of which Bitcoin represents almost half, rose approximately 5% to $1.1 trillion. Ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, also rose almost 5% once the verdict became public, now trading at just above $1,700.\n\nThe rising tide in the crypto market did not reflect a comparatively muted stock market, as the S&P 500 rose just 1% since markets opened on Tuesday, and the Nasdaq was up a bit more than 1%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s sudden price jump follows a down month for the cryptocurrency after it most recently dropped below $26,000 amid an unusually placid summer.\n\nHowever, it adds to a year of gains following a disastrous 2022, when it tumbled from nearly $70,000 at the end of 2021 to just below $17,000 to start 2023. During the banking crisis in March, which most famously felled Silicon Valley Bank, Bitcoin surged to almost $28,000. In June the digital asset rocketed past $31,000, following the application of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, for a Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nNow, the decision in favor of Grayscale by the U.S. Court of Appeals for D.C. promises to add further fuel to the ETF fire, especially as the SEC stares down a number of deadlines to provide decisions on applications in the coming months."

        "content": "The first bitcoin spot ETF is potentially closer to hitting the market after an appeals court ruled in favor of Grayscale in a highly anticipated case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Tuesday.\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the Washington, D.C. circuit said the SEC did not provide sufficient reasoning for blocking crypto asset management firm Grayscale Investments' conversion of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) to be listed on NYSE Arca.\n\nKey Takeaways A court has ruled the SEC didn't properly explain its reasoning for not approving Grayscale's attempt to convert their GBTC product into a fully-fledged bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nIn their reasoning, the court indicated the SEC didn't properly address Grayscale's contention that the spot and futures markets for bitcoin are 99.9% correlated.\n\nThe SEC will now be forced to review Grayscale's spot bitcoin ETF application once again and provide clearer reasoning if the application is still rejected.\n\nWhat Was Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF Case Against the SEC?\n\nGrayscale originally filed a lawsuit against the SEC in October 2022 after the regulatory agency denied the firm's application to launch a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhile a number of bitcoin ETFs based around futures products had already been approved, a spot bitcoin ETF still doesn't exist in the U.S. Many spot bitcoin ETF proposals have been rejected by the SEC in the past, but several more recent applications are currently under review, including an application from investment giant BlackRock.\n\nIn its original filing against the SEC, Grayscale argued a spot bitcoin ETF would not be sufficiently different or more dangerous from the sorts of futures-backed bitcoin ETF products that have already been approved.\n\nMost notably, Grayscale argued that the spot and futures markets for bitcoin are 99.9% correlated.\n\n\"The Commission neither disputed Grayscale's evidence that the spot and futures markets for bitcoin are 99.9 percent correlated, nor suggested that market inefficiencies or other factors would undermine the correlation,\" Tuesday's ruling said.\n\nWhat Would a Spot Bitcoin ETF Mean For the Market?\n\nThe SEC has long argued against the launch of a bitcoin spot ETF, saying there is too much potential for rampant fraud and manipulation in the market.\n\nTuesday's ruling doesn't mean the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF application is imminent. Instead, the SEC will need to review Grayscale's application again and provide a clearer explanation in a situation where it is denied once more.\n\nThe launch of a spot bitcoin ETF has long been viewed as a potential boon for the bitcoin price, as some pension funds and other major financial players have strict guidelines to follow in terms of what they can do with their customers' funds.\n\nAdditionally, a spot bitcoin ETF could be seen as a regulatory and reputational stamp of approval for bitcoin, leading to greater acceptance of the crypto asset among mainstream financial institutions and investors.\n\nIn response to the court's opinion on the Grayscale bitcoin ETF lawsuit against the SEC, the bitcoin price rose more than 6%.\n\n"

        "title": "Analysis | Why Crypto and Wall Street Are Longing for Spot Bitcoin ETFs - The Washington Post",
        "content": "Investors who want to bet on Bitcoin may soon have more options to choose from. Major financial firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco have submitted applications to sell US \u201cspot\u201d exchange-traded funds tied directly to Bitcoin holdings, and Grayscale Investments LLC won an Aug. 29 court ruling in its push to turn its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. In the past, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has routinely rejected these products, citing wariness over volatility and potential manipulation. But the Grayscale ruling and the BlackRock filing, in particular, might show the cryptocurrencies industry gaining the upper hand.\n\n1. What do Bitcoin ETFs look like?\n\nETFs, a $7 trillion industry, are part of a broader family of products known as exchange-traded products, though people frequently use \u201cETFs\u201d to refer to all of them since they are by far the largest and most popular category. Crypto-native firms and major Wall Street financial institutions alike are trying to launch a kind of ETF that actually holds Bitcoin, as opposed to the products that invest in Bitcoin futures. Futures-backed Bitcoin ETFs have been available to US customers since 2021, but the SEC hasn\u2019t approved any applications for so-called spot Bitcoin ETFs. Issuers and investors are advocating for spot Bitcoin ETFs to be similarly accessible to retail and institutional investors in the US, a development that\u2019s perceived as having the potential to greatly broaden participation in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. What\u2019s the difference between Bitcoin futures and spot Bitcoin?\n\nFutures are contracts to buy or sell an asset at a specified price at a later date. They are widely used in many markets, like oil, by investors who want to speculate on price movements without having to own or take possession of the underlying asset directly. As the price of Bitcoin swings up or down according to direct trading, Bitcoin futures track the cryptocurrency\u2019s spot price indirectly on exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In the spot Bitcoin market, by contrast, users buy and sell the actual digital currency via exchanges.\n\n3. What\u2019s been available before now?\n\nThe ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF became the first Bitcoin futures ETF available in the US, opening on Oct. 19, 2021, to strong demand. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF (ticker BTCC), which made its debut in Toronto in early 2021, invests directly in \u201cphysical/digital Bitcoin,\u201d its issuer, Purpose Investments Inc., said. Meanwhile, several US investment trusts have been following Bitcoin in a manner that\u2019s similar to ETFs but with certain restrictions. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (ticker GBTC) is physically backed, meaning that it holds Bitcoin. Grayscale sued the SEC over its attempt to turn GBTC into an ETF; that\u2019s the case in which Grayscale won a key legal fight in August.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Where do things stand?\n\nShare this article Share\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest asset manager, BlackRock Inc., filed an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June, kicking into high gear speculation that the long-illusive investment product would finally get SEC approval. BlackRock\u2019s application, in turn, led to a major crypto market rally and a flurry of similar ETF applications and resubmissions from issuers including Fidelity Investments and WisdomTree Inc. Grayscale has been making the argument that a conversion would help it unlock billions of dollars in value for investors of GBTC. The SEC could fight the August court ruling by asking a full slate of judges on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals or the US Supreme Court to review it.\n\n5. Why did regulators shun a Bitcoin ETF for so long?\n\nIn addition to their worries about liquidity and manipulation, regulators have expressed concern that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility might be too intense for ordinary investors \u2014 Bitcoin\u2019s last three full-year returns were gains of 305% in 2020, up another 60% in 2021, followed by a loss of 64% in 2022. The SEC has also questioned whether funds would have the information necessary to adequately value tokens like Bitcoin, including whether they can validate who owns the underlying coins. In 2021, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler testified to the Senate Banking Committee that the lack of regulatory oversight and surveillance in crypto markets led to \u201cconcerns about the potential for fraud and manipulation.\u201d In an attempt to allay some of the SEC\u2019s concerns, BlackRock and other issuers following in its footsteps have proposed so-called surveillance-sharing agreements, a way to mitigate the risk of market manipulation and fraud. Coinbase Inc., the only publicly traded, pure-play spot-crypto exchange in the US, has emerged as ETF issuers\u2019 market surveillance partner of choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. What might the SEC\u2019s process look like?\n\nSome experts are expecting an ultimate approval of at least one spot Bitcoin ETF by the end of the year, while others advise caution, as the battlefield is already littered with corpses of around 30 prior attempts that failed to persuade the SEC to give them a chance. Analysts will now also be closely watching any potential developments in Grayscale\u2019s conversion process.\n\n--With assistance from Claire Ballentine.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com"

        "content": "Bitcoin jumped 7.15% following the ruling to $27,851.82, according to Coin Metrics. The move lifted cryptocurrencies broadly as well as crypto equities higher.\n\nThe price of bitcoin surged Tuesday after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission was wrong to deny crypto investment giant Grayscale permission to convert its popular bitcoin trust into an ETF.\n\nGrayscale's lawsuit against the SEC has been closely watched by investors and other industry participants as a key catalyst that would shake up a market marred by low volatility and liquidity. Earlier this month, bitcoin trading volatility fell to its lowest level in more than four years as investors had been waiting on the sidelines for more regulatory clarity on crypto activity \u2013 whether through new legislation out of Congress or through the ability to launch a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nSeveral bitcoin futures ETFs have already been approved in the U.S.\n\n\"The denial of Grayscale's proposal was arbitrary and capricious ... The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale's proposed bitcoin ETP,\" the court said in the ruling. \"In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale's petition for review and vacate the Commission's order.\"\n\nTuesday's ruling may increase the chances that the SEC will approve other bitcoin ETF applications \u2013 including that of BlackRock , whose filing in late June drove one of bitcoin's big rallies this year, as well as Fidelity , WisdomTree, VanEck and Invesco and others. A U.S. bitcoin ETF would provide a way to get exposure to bitcoin without having to hold it, which would invite retail and institutional investors as well as wealth managers into the market.\n\nA spokesperson for the SEC said it's \"reviewing the court's decision to determine next steps.\"\n\n\"Today's decision reaffirms that a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is a matter of when, not if,\" said Steve Kurz, global head of asset management at Galaxy, which filed with Invesco for its bitcoin ETF. \"In order for digital assets to continue to flourish, they must be accessible to all investors. We believe that the ETF structure can enable greater access to and transparency across cryptocurrency investing, and truly help further democratize the asset class.\"\n\nThe ruling also comes as a relief to many crypto market participants who have been frustrated by the SEC, particularly under Chair Gary Gensler, and its insistence on regulating by enforcement. The crypto industry has long sought out clarity in rules businesses can play by to establish and build long-lasting, compliant companies. The U.S. regulatory crackdown on crypto in 2023 \u2014 which includes SEC enforcements and a lawsuit against the biggest U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase \u2014 has been a dark cloud over the market.\n\nGrayscale initiated its lawsuit against the SEC in June 2022 after the agency rejected its application to turn its bitcoin trust, better known by its ticker GBTC, into an ETF. The company decided to pursue the ETF, which would be backed by bitcoin rather than bitcoin derivatives, after the SEC approved ProShares' futures-based bitcoin ETF in October 2021.\n\nThe ruling faced multiple delays but the SEC ultimately rejected the application last summer, citing failure by Grayscale to answer questions related to concerns about market manipulation and investor protections.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust itself jumped 16.95%.\n\n\u2014CNBC's Jesse Pound contributed reporting."

Before jumping on the Bitcoin ETF bandwagon, financial institutions need to do their due diligence on Bitcoin\u2019s climate risk and its disastrous impact on communities.\n\nWashington, DC (August 30, 2023)\u2013Yesterday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sided with cryptocurrency investment firm Grayscale Investments in a lawsuit against the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which had denied the company\u2019s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an exchange traded fund (ETF). The ruling will require that Grayscale resubmit their application and that it goes back to the SEC for review. In response to the decision, Joshua Archer, Greenpeace USA Bitcoin Campaign Lead, said: \u201cThis decision could pave the way for new investment products that further impede efforts to meet our climate goals. Before jumping on the Bitcoin ETF bandwagon, financial institutions need to do their due diligence on Bitcoin\u2019s climate risk and its disastrous impact on communities. Bitcoin is using as much energy as entire countries, most of it derived from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, Bitcoin ETFs have been gaining momentum as a potential way for Bitcoin to become more mainstream, with devastating consequences for the planet. Recently, Jacobi Asset Managements attached an ESG label to a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) listed in Europe, shocking environmental experts who have been sounding the alarm about Bitcoin\u2019s energy-intensive mining process.\n\nJacobi claims that its ETF is compliant with EU rules about ESG investments based on purchasing renewable energy certificates (REC) to offset the emissions from the fund\u2019s bitcoin holdings. In a recent Bloomberg article, Matthew Brander, a senior lecturer in carbon accounting at the University of Edinburgh Business School, says using RECs to fulfill a decarbonization strategy \u201cisn\u2019t credible.\u201d\n\nIn response to Jacobi Asset Managements Bitcoin ETF, Archer said: \u201cAttempts to label a Bitcoin ETF as an ESG investment are a deception. Buying a renewable energy certification doesn\u2019t translate to a meaningful reduction in the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining and its substantial carbon emissions. It\u2019s greenwashing and it fails to address the genuine challenges of decarbonization and cleaning up Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nAs the SEC evaluates numerous applications for a spot Bitcoin ETF, it is imperative for regulators to tread with caution. The SEC\u2019s decision to green light or reject a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. should encompass a thorough evaluation of its potential climate impact and risks. Given the significant carbon footprint associated with Bitcoin mining, a comprehensive assessment of the environmental implications and climate risks should be taken into account while considering an ETF\u2019s approval. Ignoring the broader consequences of such investments could risk perpetuating unsustainable practices and hinder the progress toward reducing climate destruction.\u201d\n\n###\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Greenpeace USA Senior Communications Specialist, [email protected], (631) 404-9977\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.

My one quibble with Approach 2 is that you really do have to keep the Bitcoins somewhere safe, and there is a long, long, long history of people in crypto finding exciting new ways to lose their cryptocurrency, but I think that in 2023 \u201cbuy Bitcoins and don\u2019t lose them\u201d is the sort of thing that you can expect a regulated financial institution to manage."

Circuit sided with Grayscale in a lawsuit against the SEC, greatly improving the chances that a bitcoin exchange traded fund will be approved. The SEC had earlier denied Grayscale's application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an ETF.\n\nThe problem for the SEC is that the court has squarely rejected the very basis on which the SEC has been denying a spot bitcoin ETF for the past several years.\n\nThe SEC has said it can't approve a spot bitcoin ETF because there isn't a regulated crypto market of sufficient size to prevent manipulation.\n\nBut the court called out the SEC over its prior approval of a futures-based bitcoin product. The court said, in essence, Hey, you approved a futures-based bitcoin product. The futures and the spot market are \"like\" products. If you approve one, you have to approve the other.\n\n\"Because the spot and futures markets for bitcoin are highly related, it stands to reason that manipulation in either market will affect the price of bitcoin futures,\" the court said.\n\n\"The denial of Grayscale's proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products,\" the appeals court said.\n\nThe tragedy of this ruling is that it does nothing to alleviate the concern over possible manipulation, which has not gone away. The court simply said that the SEC has erred in approving one ETF (bitcoin futures) and not approving another (spot bitcoin).\n\nWhere to from here\n\nWhat's next? A lot depends on whether SEC Chair Gary Gensler wants to fold or fight to the end.\n\nThe SEC has several choices to make.\n\nThe first is whether it wants to appeal the case, in which case the order would be stayed until there is a decision on the appeal. The regulator has 45 days to make that decision. An appeal is possible, but the harsh tone of the judicial ruling certainly makes it more difficult for the SEC to appeal.\n\nDepending on the decision to appeal, there are several choices after that.\n\n1) Approve all or some of the nine applications for a spot bitcoin ETF as soon as possible. The SEC could go along with the court ruling and issue an order allowing the exchange on which the Grayscale ETF would list (NYSE Arca) to go ahead and list the Grayscale fund, or approve other funds that have applied.\n\nApplicants for a spot bitcoin ETF\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust\n\nArk/21 Shares Bitcoin Trust\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust\n\nBlackRock Bitcoin ETF Trust\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Trust\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust\n\n2) Delay as long as the law allows. The first of the applicants to file was Ark, which published in the Federal Register on May 15. The SEC has a maximum time of 240 days to approve or deny those applications, meaning the first deadline would be January 10, 2024.\n\n3) Come up with a new rationale why the application should not be approved and dare Grayscale to sue again. The SEC can no longer use the argument that there is not a market of sufficient size to prevent manipulation, but it could come up with other arguments.\n\nLike what? That's not clear.\n\nThere's one final possibility: the SEC could just kill the bitcoin futures ETF. That is theoretically possible, but unlikely, considering the SEC recently approved (leveraged) bitcoin futures.\n\nWho's first in line?\n\nEven assuming a spot bitcoin ETF is coming, it doesn't mean Grayscale can necessarily jump the line. It's possible the SEC will approve ARK first, or all of them at the same time.\n\nI wonder if the SEC is regretting that decision to approve bitcoin futures.\n\nNote: Matt Hougan Chief Investment, Officer for Bitwise Asset Management, one of the applicants for a spot bitcoin ETF, will appear on ETF Edge on Halftime Report Wednesday. For ETF Edge at 2:00 PM ET, Hougan will be joined by Craig Salm, Grayscale's chief legal officer, and Jeremy I. Senderowicz, an attorney with VedderPrice who has been representing ETFs for close to 20 years."

        "title": "Crypto vs SEC: What Grayscale's court victory means for bitcoin ETFs - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nProponents of digital assets were crowing on Tuesday after cryptocurrency asset manager Grayscale scored a resounding legal victory in its efforts to offer a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund, and the price of bitcoin subsequently shot up 7 per cent to nearly $28,000.\n\nBut that does not mean investors will be able to run out and buy a Grayscale spot ETF tomorrow. Nor does it immediately doom efforts by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to bring enforcement actions against some of the industry\u2019s biggest players, including crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance. The story of the watchdog\u2019s efforts to tame what it sees as a financial wild west still has some way to run.\n\nWhat did the court rule?\n\nA federal appeals court ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which the SEC approved in 2015, and which holds more than $15bn in bitcoin, into an ETF. The SEC has allowed bitcoin futures ETFs since October 2021 but contended that spot funds were prone to manipulation, since crypto tokens trade on largely unregulated markets.\n\nJudge Neomi Rao wrote in the decision that the SEC\u2019s denial was \u201carbitrary and capricious because the commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a monumental step forward for American investors, the bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d Grayscale said in a statement.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe SEC has 45 days to decide whether to abide by the decision, ask the full federal appeals court in Washington to review it, or take an appeal straight to the Supreme Court. It said on Tuesday that it was reviewing the decision.\n\nLawyers said Grayscale would have to file a new application for its ETF. But there is no guarantee that it will be approved, despite the court\u2019s decision \u2014 the SEC could reject it on other grounds.\n\nIndeed, investors still seem to think that the Grayscale trust\u2019s conversion could get gummed up. One reason Grayscale has long sought to convert its trust into an ETF is that trusts, unlike ETFs, often trade at a discount to their holdings. Even after Tuesday\u2019s ruling, the Grayscale trust was still trading at a 20 per cent discount, a sign that investors are wary that a conversion will happen soon.\n\nFinancial reform group Better Markets suggested that the agency could address the court\u2019s concerns another way \u2014 by cancelling bitcoin futures ETFs rather than approving new spot products. The ruling \u201cdoes not change the fact that the bitcoin market is subject to fraud and manipulation or that an ETF would be a serious threat to investors\u201d, said Dennis Kelleher, its chief executive.\n\nWhat does this mean for other bitcoin ETFs?\n\nThe first European spot bitcoin ETF started trading earlier this month. In the US, there are more than a dozen other applications pending, including some from the largest US asset managers. All of them would face similar questions about preventing market manipulation and how to price the asset at the end of the trading day, lawyers said.\n\nEven though Grayscale had successfully challenged the SEC\u2019s decision, there was no legal guarantee that it would jump to the front of the queue for review, said Teresa Goody Guill\u00e9n, a partner at BakerHostetler.\n\nThe most closely watched ETF proposal is from BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager. It first filed in June 15, and the SEC officially added the BlackRock application to its docket on July 13, followed by similar proposals from Invesco, VanEck and WisdomTree. All of them are coming up for preliminary deadlines this week.\n\nSEC watchers said the commission would most likely impose a 45-day delay that puts the decisions off until mid-October. \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty reasonable chance that multiple products get approved at once,\u201d said Jeremy Senderowicz, of law firm Vedder Price.\n\nWhat does the ruling mean for efforts to regulate crypto and digital assets?\n\nDigital asset groups were ecstatic about Grayscale\u2019s win. Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer Paul Grewal called it \u201ca great moment for the industry . . . while we still believe comprehensive federal crypto legislation is the best way forward, decisions like this are an important step toward the clarity the industry needs\u201d.\n\nGuill\u00e9n described the Grayscale decision as a \u201chefty blow to the SEC\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis confirms that the SEC\u2019s approach to crypto has opened it up to legal challenges \u2014 whether as arbitrary and capricious, outside its statutory authority, improper rulemaking, et cetera,\u201d she said. \u201cIt certainly confirms that the courts are holding the SEC accountable to its legal obligations, including the SEC\u2019s approach to crypto.\u201d\n\nThe decision could give impetus to those who want to give more power over the sector to another regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees derivatives.\n\n\u201cThis is a real loss of face for the SEC because of the language the appeals court used to chastise them,\u201d said Lewis Cohen, of DLXLaw.\n\nWhat happens to the SEC\u2019s enforcement cases against crypto groups such as Coinbase and Binance?\n\nThe Grayscale decision was focused on the SEC\u2019s administrative procedures rather than its legal authority to regulate and enforce. So the case has no direct impact on the watchdog\u2019s lawsuits accusing exchanges Coinbase and Binance of violating securities laws.\n\nThose cases were partly called into question by an earlier lower court decision in an SEC enforcement case that involved the Ripple token, when a judge found the company did not violate securities law when its tokens were bought by members of the public on secondary markets. The SEC is appealing against the ruling, but if that decision stands, its effort to regulate digital assets as securities would be weakened.\n\nWhile legally distinct, the Grayscale decision can be used to further claims that the SEC has been misreading current law, said attorneys for the industry.\n\n\u201cThe crypto industry is pointing to this as another example of SEC over-reach . . . it lets them spin it as an agency out of control,\u201d said Lee Reiners, who teaches a course on crypto law at Duke University.\n\nAdditional reporting by Stephen Gandel in New York"

The regulator has cases pending against Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase as well as Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world.\n\nThe price of bitcoin shot up roughly 6 per cent on Tuesday after the ruling. It is up 65 per cent year to date. Shares of Coinbase were up more than 13 per cent.\n\nThe Grayscale lawsuit focused narrowly on the question of whether the money managers could offer a spot bitcoin ETF that would expose retail investors to the real-time price of bitcoin. While the SEC has previously given the green light to ETFs based on bitcoin futures, the regulator has argued that bitcoin trades on unregulated exchanges and can be prone to market manipulation.\n\n\u201cThe denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products,\u201d Judge Neomi Rao wrote for a three-judge panel on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, which vacated the SEC\u2019s decision to block the spot ETF.\n\nThe SEC said it was reviewing the court\u2019s decision. The regulator could appeal to the full federal appeals court or the Supreme Court, but it is not clear whether it will chose to do so.\n\nDespite the SEC\u2019s tough stance on the industry, demand for a spot bitcoin ETF has grown, and more traditional players have attempted to break into the sector. The SEC is considering a half-dozen other proposals to launch spot bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, WisdomTree and Fidelity, among others.\n\n\u201cBased on the court decision, this is a close to fatal blow for the SEC\u2019s decision that it cannot allow these products to launch,\u201d said Jeremy Senderowicz of law firm Vedder Price. \u201cIf this decision stands, then it rejects the SEC\u2019s central basis for rejecting every spot bitcoin ETF for the last several years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a monumental step forward for American investors, the bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d Grayscale spokesperson Jennifer Rosenthal said."

        "content": "Michael Rihani is holding a bitcoin-emblazoned basketball in his hands.\n\nIt\u2019s a ball commemorating the Bitcoin Classic, a tournament sponsored by Cash App, during which champions are rewarded \u2014 in bitcoin, of course. Rihani explains how this piece of sports memorabilia ties into the fintech company\u2019s mission, which is to \u201credefine the world\u2019s relationship with money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping customers touch and feel bitcoin, even though it can feel like magic internet money,\u201d Rihani said.\n\n\n\nCash App\n\nUnlike the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin isn\u2019t something that can be held in one\u2019s hands \u2014 but still, its impact is tangible. Alongside his peers at Cash App, Rihani, who works as a bitcoin product lead, supports the company\u2019s efforts to help consumers see bitcoin\u2019s potential for themselves by meeting them where they are, whether that\u2019s at a basketball court or a grocery store, so that they can see the digital currency\u2019s potential for themselves. Because although Rihani may have referred to bitcoin as feeling like \u201cmagic internet money,\u201d there\u2019s a lot more at work than meets the eye.\n\nBitcoin Engineering Manager Milly Rowett describes bitcoin as an alternative currency created \u201cby the people, for the people,\u201d rooted in computer code and mathematics.\n\nYet despite its humanistic origin, Rowett admits that the way bitcoin works is inherently complex, which can feel exclusionary for everyday people.\n\nTAPPING INTO BITCOIN\u2019S POTENTIAL According to Rowett, while Cash App is not yet available outside of the United States and the U.K., the product holds the potential to accelerate bitcoin\u2019s move to a day-to-day currency, which would greatly benefit emerging markets, such as Nigeria and Argentina. In places such as these, government-issued currency, or fiat currency, is susceptible to hyperinflation and government seizure. Bitcoin would allow these markets to exchange currency freely and quickly. \u201cNo one controls bitcoin,\u201d Rihani added. \u201cNo one can compromise the system because of its decentralized nature. Everyone is on the same playing field.\u201d\n\nIn order to demystify bitcoin and its influence, Bitcoin Brand Lead Maria Pesce and her creative teammates aim to humanize it through approachable, digestible and even playful branding.\n\n\u201cBitcoin doesn\u2019t need to be this jargon-y concept that\u2019s exclusionary, as if you have to read an entire encyclopedia to understand it,\u201d she said. Her team at Cash App also creates educational content to explain the currency, including an illustrated children\u2019s book called My First Bitcoin.\n\nWhile Pesce\u2019s team embraces unconventional initiatives to reinforce bitcoin\u2019s accessibility and creativity, Rihani and Rowett focus on building a product that\u2019s easy to understand and impactful. All of these efforts, from engineering to product design to marketing, are intended to \u201cgive the product soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney can be a very stressful and personal topic,\u201d Rihani explained. \u201cWe try to make it interesting and fun both within the product and outside of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney can be a very stressful and personal topic. We make it interesting and fun.\u201d\n\nCash App\n\nReframing the Culture of Bitcoin\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever been to a bitcoin conference, it\u2019s easy to feel out of place,\u201d Pesce said.\n\nExcessive displays of wealth have been a fixture of the bitcoin scene for the past decade, reinforcing the idea that digital currency is solely for the eccentric billionaire, not the average person with a nine-to-five job. Cash App wants to turn this on its head by establishing what bitcoin would look and feel like if it was actually for everyone.\n\nPesce said the company is striving to reinvent the wheel when it comes to bitcoin marketing. For instance, it\u2019s easy to have someone speak at a conference and regurgitate the same futuristic talking points, but let\u2019s take it a step further and get outside the four walls of a conference room. During the Bitcoin Miami conference, Cash App created an actual marketplace filled with local vendors and popular brands while gifting passersby with bitcoin so they could use it in the market as a currency and experience it for themselves.\n\nCash App\n\n\u201cIt was a curated space that created a low-stakes way for everyday people to get bitcoin in their hands and experiment with what the future could look like,\u201d Pesce said.\n\nA part of Cash App\u2019s plan to reach more communities involves humanizing bitcoin. From iconic Rucker Park basketball tournaments, to inspiring creatives of bitcoin\u2019s potential at NYFW, to collaborating with artists at Art Basel, Cash App is inserting bitcoin into subcultures that it hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to thrive in yet.\n\n\u201cI feel like Cash App has a unique essence and flair that makes us as a brand stand out in the financial space,\u201d she said. \u201cCreatively we\u2019re always trying to push visual limits and connect with our customers in an authentic way.\u201d\n\n\u201cCreatively we\u2019re always trying to push visual limits and connect with our customers in an authentic way. \u201d\n\nCash App\n\nSimplicity is Key\n\nBehind the vibrant, inclusive design, the technology that powers Cash App\u2019s platform is what has made the company an innovator in the fintech space.\n\nAccording to Rowett, the company is continuously breaking ground in the engineering realm. As a part of Block, the global technology company with a focus on financial services, Cash App has access to some of the industry\u2019s most innovative organizations, including the bitcoin open-source development nonprofit Spiral.\n\nLast year, Spiral, another part of the Block ecosystem, created the Lightning Development Kit, which was used by Cash App\u2019s engineers to launch support of the bitcoin Lightning Network product. This product is designed to facilitate instant, scalable, lower-cost transactions, which is radically changing the bitcoin landscape.\n\nCash App\n\nWhile the technology that powers the company\u2019s products may sound complicated in nature to some consumers, Rihani and his teammates ensure that the impact is easy to understand. He said the company\u2019s product is designed to be as approachable as possible by rejecting technical jargon and relying on a simple UX instead.\n\nRihani also considers the company\u2019s offerings to be accessible, particularly the Bitcoin Roundups feature, which allows consumers to invest in bitcoin through their everyday purchases. For example, if a Cash App Card holder buys a coffee for $3.50, that purchase will round up to $4, with the extra $0.50 automatically invested into bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re curious and want to experiment with and learn a little bit about bitcoin, you don\u2019t need to make this big, stressful commitment,\u201d Rihani said. \u201cYou can just flip a switch and ease into it with Cash App.\u201d\n\nINHERENTLY GLOBAL Bitcoin is inherently global, given its decentralized nature, so it only makes sense that Cash App employs individuals from across the world to harness its power. With a distributed team spread across North and South America, Europe and Australia and hailing from countries including El Salvador, Lebanon and Brazil, the company has a wide range of diverse perspectives to help refine its bitcoin technology and brand. In fact, many team members came to Cash App with more bitcoin curiosity than hands-on experience, and Rowett explained that those perspectives are brought to light in cross-functional collaboration, which the company relies on to bring its global team members together for carrying projects across the finish line.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re Just Getting Started\u2019\n\nCash App\u2019s mission to \u201credefine the world\u2019s relationship with money\u201d will take some time to accomplish. But time doesn\u2019t deter from the excitement Rihani and others feel when they talk about the future; it\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nIn line with its mission, the company wants to bring the power of its app to people outside of the United States. In Rowe\u2019s mind, this feat will require careful thought and ample people power to continuously refine its approach.\n\n\u201cWe are essentially disrupting ourselves when you think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe future is incredibly bright, but it\u2019s also like riding a rollercoaster.\u201d\n\nCash App\n\nRowett added that the fast-paced nature of the bitcoin landscape, coupled with its immaturity, make it an especially energizing environment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always something happening,\u201d she mused. \u201cI imagine this is what it felt like to be working on the early internet. We feel like a pioneer front-running the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI imagine this is what it felt like to be working on the early internet. We feel like a pioneer front-running the industry.\u201d\n\nWith several key projects in the works \u2014 such as a bitcoin wallet with both hardware and mobile components, called Bitkey \u2014 Block is at a pivotal stage in its growth. For both existing employees and those who join Cash App over the next year, these undertakings unlock the opportunity to build a future beyond what anyone can imagine.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is so much bigger than us,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cWe\u2019re really building the foundation for something that the next generation will hopefully experience and utilize daily.\u201d\n\nPesce, who considers her work at the company to be \u201cone of the biggest marketing challenges of her career,\u201d acknowledges the roadblocks that come with working on a new digital asset class. Nevertheless, she considers the work to be \u201cconsuming, powerful and influential.\u201d\n\nFor Rihani, working at Cash App isn\u2019t just exhilarating from a professional standpoint. He believes the work they do has the potential to help people across the globe \u2014 including his loved ones.\n\nHe said his family and friends in Lebanon have lost 98 percent of their finances due to hyperinflation, and they\u2019re far from the only ones to be affected by a volatile financial system. By supporting bitcoin, he feels he\u2019s doing his part to help others achieve economic stability, one feature update at a time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re literally paving the path for bitcoin, which is scary at times but also very rewarding,\u201d Rihani said. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive opportunity to help billions of people all over the world, and we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d\n\n"

And miners have tapped that power for their energy-intensive computers. Not only does Iceland have an abundance of renewable energy but its cool climate is attractive to overworked data centers."

        "title": "Spot bitcoin ETF inches ahead with SEC's court loss - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "The SEC\u2019s loss in court Tuesday means that the agency must go back and review Grayscale\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF application \u2014 but don\u2019t expect any products to come to market soon.\n\nIn a ruling issued earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit wrote that the Securities and Exchange Commission could not explain why it denied Grayscale\u2019s application, as it had approved bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful,\u201d the court wrote.\n\nThe news was quickly welcomed by the crypto investing community, and it\u2019s something that the many firms that have filed for spot bitcoin ETFs will be watching closely. But the next steps are cloudy, as the SEC could appeal the decision \u2014 and even if it doesn\u2019t, it could still reject the Grayscale application.\n\nAlthough the regulator has approved bitcoin futures products, it has pointed to potential manipulation and a lack of investor protection as problems for spot crypto ETFs. Grayscale had filed to convert its Bitcoin Trust to an ETF.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic milestone for American investors, the bitcoin ecosystem and all those who have been advocating for bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an announcement. \u201cGrayscale has adhered to U.S. financial rules and regulations in building our product suite since our founding in 2013, underpinned by one fundamental belief: investors deserve transparent, regulated access to crypto. It\u2019s incredibly exciting that we are one step closer to making a U.S. spot bitcoin ETF a reality.\u201d\n\nNumerous firms have filed applications this year with the SEC for spot bitcoin products, including massive asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity.\n\n\u201cThis is really big news \u2014 not just for Grayscale, but for the other issuers who have filed for spot bitcoin ETFs over the past few months,\u201d said Roxanna Islam, associate director of research at VettaFi. \u201cThe most important thing to remember \u2026 is that this does not mean that the SEC is automatically approving a spot bitcoin product. What it does is open up a path to it.\u201d\n\nEven if the SEC does green-light a spot bitcoin ETF, Grayscale\u2019s might not be the first, as other firms filed earlier and are essentially in the front of the approval line, Islam said.\n\nEven so, \u201cGrayscale has a step up among the other issuers, just because they have a trust product out there that already has assets in it, and they\u2019ve been a huge name in this legal battle,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a statement, an SEC spokesperson said the regulator is reviewing the court\u2019s decision before deciding its next steps.\n\nThe Crypto Council for Innovation characterized the ruling as a step forward for all cryptocurrency products and providers.\n\n\u201cThis is big, positive, and precedent setting news,\u201d Ji Kim, the council\u2019s head of global policy, said in a statement. \u201cIt provides the obvious reminder that it is critical for regulators to provide much needed clarity and rationale when making such critical determinations affecting such a significant industry. The door is now open for a range of investors, including those who have historically been apprehensive due to a lack of regulatory clarity.\u201d\n\nADVISOR PERSPECTIVES\n\n\u201cRetail investors have been waiting for a bitcoin spot ETF for quite some time now, although the discussion/excitement has certainly died down during the sell-off over the last 21-plus months,\u201d Vaughn Kellerman, associate wealth advisor at HCM Wealth Advisors, said in an email.\n\nThe availability of a spot bitcoin ETF would provide an alternative to buying the cryptocurrency on an exchange \u2014 which, given the recent problems with FTX and others, has discouraged people, Kellerman said. And an ETF would also allow investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrency in individual retirement accounts, he noted.\n\n\u201cWhile I believe buying and storing bitcoin on your own hardware wallet is the best choice, there is a need for a spot Bitcoin ETF for the asset to take the next major jump forward regarding larger overall adoption both from the retail investors and institutional investors,\u201d he said.\n\nNot everyone feels that way.\n\n\u201cThe [Sam Bankman-Fried] case and the trial of a former president will prove to the investing public that crypto is a pyramid scheme, so my recommendation to anyone that asks is to stay away,\u201d Michael Hansen, managing partner of Frontier Wealth Strategies, said in an email. \u201cIf you have an appetite for risky investments, find a PE deal for a tech startup, because now is a great time for doing so.\u201d"

        "title": "Little evidence that a spot bitcoin ETF would expand the market - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nYou don\u2019t have to want to invest in bitcoin to be in favour of US regulators giving their approval to a bitcoin exchange traded fund. You can disapprove of other people putting their money into the cryptocurrency but defend the idea that the Securities and Exchange Commission should let them. Perhaps not to the death \u2014 we don\u2019t need to go all Voltaire about this \u2014 but you get the idea.\n\nApplications for a spot bitcoin ETF \u2014 a fund that would actually hold bitcoin directly as opposed to investing in derivatives tied to the bitcoin price \u2014 have been consistently rejected by the SEC over the past decade.\n\nBut a court ruling this week looks to have changed the picture. A judge ruled that the regulator acted capriciously in denying the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\u2019s request to convert to an ETF, given futures-based bitcoin funds are already available.\n\nThe ruling added to excitement about spot bitcoin ETFs that has been building since June when BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager, put in its own application to launch one. Surely, crypto enthusiasts reasoned, well-connected BlackRock would not be making such a request unless it knew the regulator was thawing its position?\n\nThere were specific reasons to think BlackRock will be able to break the logjam. Its application included a plan for a \u201csurveillance-sharing\u201d arrangement with a crypto exchange, to deal with the SEC\u2019s concern that nefarious traders could manipulate the market to the disadvantage of the ETF\u2019s investors. Other asset managers, including Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark, have amended their pending bitcoin ETF applications to copy the BlackRock plan.\n\nThe bitcoin price shot up 20 per cent in a week after the BlackRock news in June, and was up 7 per cent on Tuesday\u2019s court victory by Grayscale, as traders bet the launch of an ETF will tempt in a rash of new buyers.\n\nPersonally, I am tiring of the 15-year quest to find a use for the bitcoin blockchain beyond self-reflexive speculation on the price of bitcoin itself. It has been sad to watch a generation of young people lured into cryptocurrency trading instead of learning the long-term investment techniques that build wealth. It\u2019s been enraging to watch the explosion of get-rich-quick products labelled \u201cdecentralised finance\u201d when so many are just Ponzi schemes hiding in plain sight. To see some of the more egregious purveyors of this financial snake oil being hauled before the courts has been pleasing but it\u2019s surprising, frankly, to see the \u201cvalue\u201d of bitcoin and all the other cryptocurrencies remain above $1tn despite the cascading failures of the past year.\n\nBut who am I to disagree with BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink\u2019s view \u2014 recently acquired \u2014 that bitcoin is an \u201cinternational asset\u201d for investors to \u201cplay\u201d as an alternative to gold or currencies such as the euro or sterling? His group\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF will probably have lower fees than the current futures-based funds in the US, and provide a better guarantee of doing what it says on the tin \u2014 tracking the price of bitcoin \u2014 than alternatives such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust which, as currently structured, has swung as far as 50 per cent in either direction from its net asset value. For people who feel they must \u201cplay\u201d, spot bitcoin ETFs will be safer, cheaper, simpler products, and the benefits of protecting people who have already been lured in to cryptocurrency outweigh the risk of luring in more.\n\nTraders already have a cornucopia of crypto vehicles to pick from on US exchanges, from \u201c2x leveraged\u201d bitcoin funds using derivatives to stock funds stuffed with highly speculative companies that have cryptocurrency or blockchain investments of their own. By comparison, a spot bitcoin fund looks positively vanilla.\n\nMore generally, ETFs are home to a dazzling array of bad investment ideas, even more so now that actively managed funds are crowding in after the index trackers that established the product.\n\nI am tiring of the 15 year quest to find a use for the bitcoin blockchain beyond self-reflexive speculation on the price of bitcoin itself\n\nThe flipside is that fund managers have become more inclined to close funds when an investment fad fizzles, says Todd Rosenbluth of VettaFi, a research firm. Casualties in recent months have included the Punk Subversive Metaverse ETF and the AdvisorShares Drone Technology ETF. BlackRock has no Midas touch, either. Last year, it shut a number of ETFs under the iShares Evolved brand that promised to use machine learning and analysis of font sizes in financial documents to sort stocks into sectoral funds ranging from consumer discretionary to \u201cinnovative healthcare\u201d. They had failed to gather significant assets.\n\nThere is scant evidence that a spot bitcoin ETF will expand the market at this point. BlackRock will put its marketing muscle behind the product, but I doubt it will be taking out Super Bowl commercials. Crypto trading was long ago \u201cdemocratised\u201d by Coinbase and other exchanges and the demos has drifted off. Those betting the debut of a spot bitcoin ETF will usher in a new bull market are just as likely to find it opens up short-selling opportunities that hold the price down.\n\nJPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou predicts a BlackRock launch will do little more than draw liquidity away from other products, notably bitcoin futures, in a zero-sum game. Spot bitcoin funds have existed for some time outside the US but have failed to attract large investor interest, he pointed out in a research note.\n\nThe two-and-a-half-year-old Purpose Bitcoin ETF in Canada has just $600mn in assets, for example, and bitcoin funds globally have not had significant inflows since mid-2021. Spot bitcoin ETFs would be a perfectly inoffensive addition to the US market, though the SEC might find it is opening the stable door after the horse has died.\n\nStephen Foley is the FT\u2019s US accounting editor.

Still, the platform had its first profitable quarter ever, and its retirement offerings continued to gain traction.\n\nTransaction-based revenues, notably, declined 7% on a quarterly basis to $193 million, with cryptocurrencies, options, and equities seeing declines of 18%, 5%, and 7%, respectively.\n\nBitcoin got a boost on Tuesday from news that a judge sided with asset manager Grayscale in its suit against the Securities and Exchange Commission over converting its bitcoin trust into an ETF. The cryptocurrency popped 5% immediately after the news as traders upped bets that the ruling could also pave the way for the SEC to approve numerous applications for spot bitcoin ETFs, which experts say would be a boon for the token's price.\n\nSome strategists see bitcoin soaring six-figures over the next year thanks to the April 2024 halving process, which will cut crypto miners' reward in half to create a scarcity effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Taking a conservative view, if bitcoin stays around $30K until the halving, even a 12-month post-halving increase of 250% \u2014 which, again, is conservative relative to previous halvings \u2014 would price bitcoin at $105K,\" Joe Kelly, the CEO of financial firm Unchained, wrote in a recent note.\n\nCoinShares data shared with Insider on Tuesday showed that last week saw the largest outflows from digital assets since March, with bitcoin seeing the biggest outflows totalling $149 million."

        "title": "Bitcoin: Bull vs. Bear - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "A look at a price chart over the past decade would easily show that Bitcoin (BTC -0.36%) is, without a doubt, one of the best financial assets to have owned. It has skyrocketed from about $123 in August 2013 to just over $26,000 today. That's a ridiculous gain of more than 21,000% compared to the 283% rise of the Nasdaq Composite Index.\n\nHowever, the ride up hasn't been smooth, as it's been full of volatility. As of this writing, Bitcoin is currently 61% off its peak price. This might prompt some to eye this big discount to its all-time high as a potential buying opportunity.\n\nTo gain a better perspective of the situation, let's examine the bull and bear cases for the world's most valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nMassive upside\n\nIn the past three months, major asset management firms, like BlackRock, Fidelity, and WisdomTree, have filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which haven't yet been available in the U.S. These large investment companies manage trillions of dollars on behalf of global client bases. And their involvement with Bitcoin might provide a stamp of approval for the crypto, which could introduce a massive inflow of fresh capital. That might provide the tailwind Bitcoin needs to reach new highs.\n\nAnother reason to be optimistic about this top digital asset is that there's a lot of upside potential should more people learn about and try to understand Bitcoin. It might appear overly complex, but Bitcoin's entire objective is to fix the issues that come about with government-controlled money, known as fiat currency. Some countries deal with hyperinflation, while almost all nations undergo ongoing money-printing measures to help deal with the huge and growing amounts of outstanding debt. In the U.S., this reality doesn't even include underfunded entitlements like Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThis financial mismanagement by those in charge can't go on forever. Once people come to this conclusion, they'll naturally be drawn to owning Bitcoin. Its decentralization and fixed supply cap are the exact opposite traits of government money.\n\nThis leads to the next point, which is that the central bank can't keep raising rates forever, nor can it keep them this high for long. Interest payments will continue to make up a higher part of the government's budget. Consequently, the possibility that interest rates will eventually decline again can be a boon for riskier assets like Bitcoin.\n\nThe risks are clear\n\nIf the U.S., the world's economic superpower, were to make it illegal to mine or own Bitcoin within its borders, then it would definitely deal a blow to the crypto. This would be possible by shutting down the major brokerages and exchanges, like Coinbase or Robinhood, and seriously restricting their activities. By limiting access to Bitcoin, its price could be under pressure as demand is weakened.\n\nAt a high level, Bitcoin is just software. And as is the case with lines of computer code, there's the chance that a bug is eventually revealed. That's always a possibility, albeit a small one.\n\nIf the software revealed issues, it could undermine the Bitcoin network's security, which is its key feature. To its credit, Bitcoin hasn't been hacked in its more than 14 years of existence. But if something happened that caused everyone's private keys to be easily accessed, akin to bank accounts and passwords being exposed, then Bitcoin's price would crash as trust vanishes.\n\nAnother clear risk that might be overlooked is that interest in owning Bitcoin simply disappears. This could happen for several reasons, including the possibility that gold becomes even more attractive as a store of value, particularly for the younger and digitally native demographic. Interest could also wane if government money printing ceases to exist, as there would be less of a reason to find a solution to the current monetary system. In this scenario, Bitcoin would probably fall out of favor, and its price would decline.\n\nA compelling asset to own\n\nBitcoin's risks are important factors to keep in mind, especially when trying to gain a thorough understanding of this top digital asset. After all, there is still so much uncertainty going forward, with its ultimate outcome still a topic of huge debate.\n\nNonetheless, I believe that Bitcoin's bullish arguments outweigh the potential downside, a point of view that only strengthens with each passing year. I think investors who took the time to learn more would come to the same conclusion."

        "content": "After an impressive rally to start off 2023, persistent macroeconomic uncertainties and other factors are taking some wind out of Bitcoin's (BTC -0.36%) sails. On Aug. 16, Bitcoin began to tumble, at one point shedding more than 10%, marking an end to a historically long period of record-low volatility.\n\nBitcoin's boom-and-bust cycles are well known, making the recent sell-off nothing surprising. But rather than projecting the likelihood of Bitcoin entering a new bull market and surpassing previous levels based on a hunch, we need to dig a little deeper to understand the inner workings of what makes Bitcoin unique and why today could be an opportune moment for investors to add more Bitcoin to their portfolios while it trades below $30,000.\n\nNew hash rate record\n\nBecause the crypto is a decentralized network with no single entity managing funds, Bitcoin holders should have confidence that the blockchain is secure. And based on recent trends, that confidence should be higher than ever.\n\nHash rate is a metric the quantifies Bitcoin's computational power. The greater the hash rate, the greater the security and strength of the network -- and it just recently hit an all-time high. Not only that, but it has consistently grown for more than a decade despite some ups and downs.\n\nData by TradingView\n\nA higher hash rate indicates more miners are joining the Bitcoin network with more powerful machines, thereby increasing the system's integrity. Even during a brutal bear market, this continuous growth is a testament to the network's resilience and reinforces Bitcoin's position as the most reliable and secure blockchain, a central aspect of its long-term value proposition.\n\nHistoric supply shortage\n\nAdding to Bitcoin's distinctness is a mechanism built into its code known as a halving. The halving is an event that occurs every time 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain (roughly every four years): The issuance rate awarded to miners for successfully mining a block is cut in half. Currently, the miner reward is 6.25 bitcoins, but in about eight months, the next halving will occur and reduce it to 3.125 bitcoins.\n\nObviously, the diminishing rate of Bitcoin's supply growth figures into the simple dynamics of supply and demand. As fewer bitcoins enter the market, assuming demand stays at least the same, prices should increase.\n\nAnother halving on the horizon might be reason enough to take advantage of Bitcoin's recent dip, yet data shows that the supply shock of this halving could be unlike any other in Bitcoin's history due to an additional factor.\n\nThe number of bitcoins on exchanges shows a clear trend of an increasing supply until March 2020, when supply peaked at nearly 3.2 million coins. At 2.2 million, the number of coins available today is the same as in the spring of 2018.\n\nThere are likely a handful of reasons behind this, but the most straightforward explanation involves the halving of Bitcoin's supply growth. Up until March 2020, the growth rate of Bitcoin seems to have outpaced demand, at least enough to cause bitcoins to pile up on exchanges. Yet after the most recent halving, in May 2020, the situation changed.\n\nWith the next halving set for April 2024, Bitcoin's available supply will likely face another shock and continue to dwindle. The current scarcity of Bitcoin combined with the decreasing pace of supply growth may cause Bitcoin's price to be pushed and pulled by the dynamics of supply and demand more than ever, making the recent dip below $30,000 a better opportunity to buy as investors remain focused on short-term instability."

        "content": "Today, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC to 75% by the end of this year, and 95% by the end of 2024.\n\n\"The chances of the SEC approving spot Bitcoin ETFs this year have risen from 75% from 65% following Grayscale's court win, we believe, while the odds by the end of 2024 reach 95%,\" said the analysts. \"The judges unanimously repudiated the SECs arguments, and the agency will struggle to justify further denials as it faces deadlines, negative PR and HashDex's novel approach.\"\n\nYesterday, the DC Circuit court of appeals vacated the SEC's denial of Grayscale's $GBTC conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF. While this did not result in GBTC automatically being converted to a spot Bitcoin ETF, this victory was a big step towards the approval of one in the future.\n\n\"The appeals court found the SEC to be arbitrary and capricious in its denial oder of GBTC's conversion into an ETF and vacated the decision,\" the analysts continued. \"The written opinion from Judge Neomi Rao repudiated virtually every argument made by the SEC when comparing the Bitcoin spot and futures markets.\"\n\nA SEC decision on multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs is due by the end of this week, with many believing the applications will be further delayed as these so close to the Grayscale court outcome that just happened. Although, Balchunas said he's \"not sure timelines will matter as much in this situation,\" and that what is more likely is that eventually the SEC will give in and approve an imminent launch.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

The SEC ruling has been vacated.\n\nLast year, Grayscale applied for the approval for the fund and was denied. An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a pooled investment that is tied to a specific set of assets, which might be an index, a sector, a set of commodities, or something else. Grayscale\u2019s is \u201csomething else\u201d \u2014 Bitcoin. That could let large investors, such as pension funds, invest in Bitcoin.\n\nThe SEC has previously approved ETFs that track Bitcoin futures, but not so-called spot ETFs, which directly track Bitcoin price. Grayscale wanted to convert its Bitcoin trust to an ETF, which would let investors trade shares more freely than the closed-end trust currently allows. Because it\u2019s difficult for investors to trade their shares, Grayscale\u2019s trust often trades below the actual price of the Bitcoin it represents. The switch to an ETF would make it easier to create and destroy shares, so that discount would vanish."

        "content": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion in Grayscale v. SEC on Tuesday, ruling that the agency was unreasonable to deny the crypto giant permission to launch a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThe ruling, which comes after the Securities and Exchange Commission rejected Grayscale\u2019s latest bid to launch a Bitcoin ETF in October, opens the door to a potentially huge amount of new capital flowing into crypto markets.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling turned on the SEC\u2019s inconsistent handling of applications for Bitcoin futures ETFs, which it had approved, and for regular ETPs, or exchange-traded products, which Grayscale had sought.\n\n\u201cThe Commission failed to reasonably explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale\u2019s similar proposed bitcoin ETP. Without such an explanation, inconsistent treatment of similar products is arbitrary and capricious,\u201d wrote Judge Neomi Rao.\n\nThe SEC did not immediately comment on the ruling or say whether it would appeal.\n\nBitcoin immediately soared after the ruling, climbing over 5% in just minutes, as did the price of several other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum.\n\nThe ruling has big implications for crypto markets. While retail consumers and hedge funds have invested in Bitcoin for more than a decade, pension funds and other big players have largely stayed on the sidelines. This is in part because corporate bylaws restrict what they may invest in on behalf of their clients. The introduction of a Bitcoin packaged in the familiar financial wrapper of an ETF is widely expected to wipe away such legal and reputational concerns and lead to a massive liquidity boost.\n\n\u201cThis is a monumental step forward for American investors, the Bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for Bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d Grayscale said in a statement.\n\nGrayscale isn\u2019t the only firm that stands to benefit. Earlier this year, the financial giants BlackRock and Fidelity also were among those seeking permission for a Bitcoin ETF. To be clear, the SEC isn\u2019t now required to immediately implement the findings, but while the agency still could appeal, applications from the likes of BlackRock makes it more likely the SEC will simply accept the decision and approve applications in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cFalls short of the standard\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit began last October when Grayscale sued the SEC after it rejected the company\u2019s most recent application to launch a Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale\u2019s claim focused on the disparate treatment of ETFs that package Bitcoin futures contracts, which the agency has allowed since 2021, and ones for spot market Bitcoin, which it had repeatedly denied.\n\nAt a hearing in March, Grayscale argued the SEC\u2019s purported justification for denying its application\u2014that the underlying Bitcoin market could be manipulated\u2014was unreasonable since the same concerns could apply to the futures market.\n\nRao agreed, and in her opinion she focused in particular on the fact that there has been a 99.9% correlation between the Bitcoin futures price and the Bitcoin spot price\u2014and that Grayscale proposed to rely on an identical \u201csurveillance\u201d agreement as is being used to oversee the Bitcoin futures ETF. This implied that the SEC\u2019s concern about manipulation was not reasonable.\n\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s unexplained discounting of the obvious financial and mathematical relationship between the spot and futures markets,\u201d Rao wrote, \u201cfalls short of the standard for reasoned decision making.\u201d"

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether were little changed on Tuesday morning in Asia, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Cardano\u2019s ADA led the gains following bullish comments from founder Charles Hoskinson. He predicted a surge in price past both Ether and Bitcoin. Solana\u2019s SOL posted more losses, despite last week\u2019s news of Solana Pay\u2019s tie-up with Shopify. Analysts expect the generally downbeat summer mood in the crypto market to pick up in fall. Elsewhere, the Forkast 500 NFT Index continued to decline, reflecting more bad news for the NFT industry. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced Monday it has charged L.A.-based media company Impact Theory LLC with securities violations related to its offering of NFTs. Meanwhile, U.S. equity futures were trading flat after Monday\u2019s gains.\n\nSummer blues\n\nBitcoin edged down 0.12% for the last 24 hours to US$26,050.51 as of 07:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The token is down 0.30% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached a high of US$26,198.58 in the early hours of the morning before falling back.\n\nEther also dipped 0.40% to US$1,650.23 for a 0.99% weekly loss.\n\n\u201cThere might be another selloff taking place, but currently we\u2019ve experienced the standard August and September correction, through which it seems likely that we won\u2019t be continuing that fall for long and rather have an upwards trend from here on out,\u201d Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, CEO of Amsterdam-based crypto trading company MN Trading, said via email.\n\nVan de Poppe\u2019s comments were in line with a report by JPMorgan Chase & Co. that forecast \u201climited downside\u201d for the crypto market as losses slow. The U.S. banking giant\u2019s analysts found a drop in the number of Bitcoin-linked futures contracts on exchanges that are yet to be settled \u2014 a sign that downward price movement is losing its momentum.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be having a potential run from here,\u201d Van de Poppe said in a weekend tweet. \u201cThis rally should most likely occur in Q4 of 2023, during a good period for crypto markets (October-December tend to be this).\u201d\n\nDid #Bitcoin bottom on this correction or are we expecting $20K?\n\n\n\nThe Million Dollar question is whether #Bitcoin is done on this correction, or whether we'll see more pain.\n\n\n\nIf you'd ask people before the drop, you'd be getting a more bullish answer. If you'd ask people right\u2026 pic.twitter.com/9niq2jhw5k \u2014 Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) August 26, 2023\n\nVan de Poppe pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s next halving event, which is expected to occur on April 16, 2024, as a cause for optimism from the fourth quarter of this year. The halving event will see the amount of new Bitcoin issued every 10 minutes cut in half, increasing its scarcity. This is widely anticipated to produce a surge in the token\u2019s price. He also highlighted this week\u2019s release in the U.S. of employment data and the purchasing managers\u2019 index as further potential boosts for Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s decision on Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications from investment heavyweights BlackRock, Fidelity and others will also play a role, Van de Poppe said. Some of those decisions could be made as early as Saturday.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Cardano\u2019s ADA led the winners, rising 1.46% to US$0.2669 for a weekly gain of 1.24%.\n\nCardano blockchain founder Charles Hoskinson, appearing at Denver-based conference Rare Evo on Saturday, predicted that ADA will overtake Bitcoin and Ethereum to become the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency. ADA is currently the world\u2019s seventh largest crypto, with a market capitalization of US$9.36 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana\u2019s SOL led the losers. It fell 1.35% to US$20.50 for a weekly loss of 3.61%. Those losses arrived despite the news that Solana Pay \u2014 a free-to-use payment protocol built on the Solana blockchain \u2014 has partnered with Canada-based e-commerce platform Shopify to allow USDC stablecoin payments for online shopping without intermediary fees.\n\nThe token gained briefly on Aug. 24, the day of the Solana Pay announcement. It added 7% to US$21.98 before falling back.\n\nBenjamin Stani, director of business development at Hong Kong-based digital asset broker Matrixport, said that the integration of Solana with a mainstream shopping app was a minor victory for the industry and wouldn\u2019t have much effect on markets.\n\n\u201cThis is just another step towards stablecoins going mainstream in line with PayPal\u2019s PYUSD,\u201d he said. He added that, while good news for Solana, its \u201cnot really a major breakthrough.\u201d\n\nPrepare for an NFT bloodbath\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.16% over the past 24 hours to 2,240.52 as of 7:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 3.25% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Polygon and Cardano indexes moved down, while the Solana index rose.\n\nThe NFT industry was reacting Tuesday to more bad regulatory news from the U.S.. The SEC announced Monday it has charged Los Angeles-based media company Impact Theory with offering and selling NFTs as unregistered securities. The charges are the first brought by the regulator against an NFT project.\n\nThe SEC suing Impact Theory for selling NFT securities is a pretty big deal.\n\n\n\nBecause if you take a closer look at the details, the description applies to quite a few NFT projects \u2013 probably also to one you are holding right now. pic.twitter.com/75kY0QQIDG \u2014 wale.swoosh \ud83d\udc33 (@waleswoosh) August 28, 2023\n\nAccording to the SEC, the company earned almost US$30 million by selling digital tokens, known as Founder\u2019s Keys, to hundreds of investors in late 2021. The agency announcement said that, while Impact Theory has not accepted or denied the charges, it has agreed to pay US$6.1 million in fines and to destroy all the Founder\u2019s Keys it controls.\n\n\u201cPrepare for a bloodbath in the NFT markets,\u201d wrote Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs. \u201cSurprisingly, the community seems to have been caught largely off guard, which makes me more concerned in the short term about NFTs\u2019 value.\u201d\n\nPetscher said he expects the SEC to pursue charges against more NFT projects in the future. NFT prices will plummet as a result, he said, as traders rush out of the market.\n\n\u201cThis will be how the market finds its bottom, but we are far away from that actually coming into picture,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 3.23% in the past 24 hours to US$9.94 million. Volume on Ethereum fell while the other top five chains \u2014 Solana, Mythos, ImmutableX and Polygon \u2014 all logged increases, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nIn terms of NFT collections, blockchain gaming-based titles occupied the top five positions in CryptoSlam\u2019s ranking. Mythos chain-based DMarket took top spot at US$857,652 in trade volume. It was followed by Gods Unchained, Sorare and DraftKings \u2014 all of which posted gains \u2014 and PLAYNFT, which dropped 14.90%.\n\nSome macro positives\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading flat as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong after Monday\u2019s regular session gains. The main Asia stock indexes all rose. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng led the gains with a 1.29% rise on the back of positive developments in both the U.S. and China.\n\nThe Chinese government, which has been exploring ways to address July\u2019s bearish macroeconomic data, reportedly cut stamp duty on stock trading by 50% on Monday \u2014 a first since 2008. Beijing said it also plans to limit the number of new stock listings to help balance supply and demand.\n\nHowever, experts say these measures may not be enough to encourage investors.\n\n\u201cIf they still feel bearish on the economic recovery of China, then it may be difficult to convince them to buy shares just because of these technical changes,\u201d Jason Lui, head of Asia-Pacific equity and derivative strategy for global markets at BNP Paribas, told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMeanwhile, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell used his Jackson Hole speech Friday to say the U.S. economy has grown stronger. However, with inflation still above its 2% target, the Fed will \u201cproceed carefully\u201d on interest rates, he said.\n\nAn unexpected rise in U.S. treasury yields in July and August could also complicate Fed policy. As of early afternoon trading in Asia, the yield on U.S. 10-year treasury bonds was 4.192% \u2014 up from 3.39% at the start of 2023 \u2014 a figure some analysts think could lead to further hikes.\n\n\u201cWas he hawkish? Yes. But given the jump in yields lately, he wasn\u2019t as hawkish as some had feared,\u201d Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group, told CNBC. Last week, Reuters reported that Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and Boston Fed President Susan Collins both separately said the jump in bond yields could be positive for the Fed\u2019s efforts to cool inflation.\n\nThe Fed raised its interest rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% in July, the highest level in 22 years. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 21.5% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September, up from 14.0% a week ago\n\nInvestors now look toward U.S. economic data releases later this week, including the personal consumption expenditures price index on Thursday and the labor report Friday.\n\n(Updates to add Equities section)"

        "title": "Grayscale bitcoin ETF may be giving bulls 'too much hopium': Strategist - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "A federal appeals court handed Grayscale a monumental victory in its path to converting its bitcoin trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin ETF. Crypto traders are doubling down on bullish sentiments as this decision could change the tide for broadened crypto asset exposures in the future.\n\nSwan Bitcoin Managing Director Terrence Yang joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the volatility to come in the crypto market.\n\n\"Too many bulls... that think the ETF will be approved ASAP or in the next several weeks,\" Yang says. \"I'm not sure we are going to see a launch of any bitcoin, I don't think we'll see we will be a launch of any spot bitcoin ETF before year-end and I'm happy to bet people on this, I've been... goading some of the hopium bros on Twitter to bet against me.\"\n\nYang also comments on the potential for bitcoin price manipulation and how Wall Street firms like BlackRock (BLK) may adopt bitcoin ETF investments.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- So what do you think that then means for the price of crypto, the price of Bitcoin then, at least in the near term. Certainly sounds like we could see a lot of volatility if that is, in fact, the case.\n\nTERRENCE YANG: It, there will be some volatility as the market digests, and I believe comes around to my view that short term, there's too much hopium, there's too many crypto bulls and Bitcoin bulls who think that the ETF will be approved ASAP or in the next several weeks. I'm not sure we're going to see a launch of any Bitcoin. I don't think we'll see a launch of any spot Bitcoin ETF before year end. And I'm happy to bet people on this, I've made been goading some of the hopium bros on Twitter to bet against me.\n\n- Even with the cleanup that's happening within the space, you said that there's still a lot of price manipulation that's happening specifically on Bitcoin. We're seeing it trading above that $27,000 handle. What is the real value, you think, if the manipulation is still happening.\n\nTERRENCE YANG: So I think Bitcoin, the real value, is it's way undervalued. This is the best asymmetric upside, asset with asymmetric upside I've ever seen in my life, and I've been in finance many years. [CHUCKLES] But short term, who knows, because until the wash trading price manipulation and fraud is completely cleaned up.\n\nStory continues\n\nI do feel like if you look at the trading volumes they've gone down in Bitcoin, maybe because of US and Chinese authorities going after some of these Chinese exchanges like Binance, like Kobe, and the threat of that has made them not want to be as aggressive, I think, in their wash trading. So maybe the current volume is about right when you strip out the bump up in trading volume due to this recent Grayscale decision. But for some time, we've been seeing a pretty significant decline in trading volume.\n\n- Terrence, interest that we've seen from BlackRock, from Fidelity, just to name a few on the spot Bitcoin ETF here potentially for the future, how big of a catalyst is that going to be just in terms of wider adoption and getting more people to eventually potentially trust Bitcoin.\n\nTERRENCE YANG: Sure. Once they launch, especially those two plus Invesco which is the manager for QQQ, the very popular tech ETF, once those three launch, or any of those three launch, it will be a massive bullish sign where a flood of money should come into Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhy? Because those three are three of the most respected traditional finance or tradfi companies in the world. They really know ETFs, they really know finance, they're respected by institutions, and high net worth and other folks as well. So once they are actually launching and offering Bitcoin ETFs, I think a flood of cash will come in.\n\nVery different from gold ETFs. Why? Because gold was around for thousands of years, accepted across all cultures as valuable. By the time the gold ETF came about it was like OK, this is great. There was a flood of cash that rushed into gold, gold because of gold ETFs, but I think with Bitcoin it's going to be like 10x bigger if not much more.\n\nBecause Bitcoin is a teenager, it's considered a scam by some of the people I respect the most in my life, family members, extremely accomplished law school classmates, they don't get Bitcoin, and I think that's going to change within about a year."

A federal appeals court says the SEC must review Grayscale's bid to convert its bitcoin trust into an ETF. The decision effectively paves the way for the first spot bitcoin ETF and more widely for crypto assets to cement their status as part of mainstream finance.\n\nNow shares in the trust rocketed on the ruling. Take a look at that price action. It manages the world's largest cryptocurrency fund and first applied for the conversion back in October of 2021. There was a big reaction across all of Bitcoin and crypto related assets, including the likes of Coinbase, Riot Blockchain, and Hive. BlackRock, Fidelity, and WisdomTree. They are just some of the firms that have applied for their own ETFs over the last few months as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nWell joining us now, we've got Michael Sonnenshein, who is the Grayscale CEO. Great to have you here in studio with us.\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: Great to be here.\n\n- So we were taking a look at the reaction yesterday. What type of inflows did you see just off of the ruling itself?\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: Well yesterday, we actually did see a pretty big spike in trading volume in GBTC. You know, this is the world's largest bitcoin investment vehicle. It's been publicly traded since 2015. It's been an SEC reporting company since 2020. It's held by nearly a million investors here in the US directly within ETFs, within mutual funds. So there are a lot of eyes and certainly a lot of hands looking very closely at the GBTC victory yesterday.\n\n- And Michael, Rachelle here. I mean, a lot of people were wondering, you know, questioning the logic. You already have bitcoin future ETFs allowed. So a lot of people were wondering why we weren't seeing these spot bitcoin ETFs. What does this now open up, and what's been some of the reaction that you've been getting from investors?\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: Well, you know, yesterday was really an overwhelming victory not just for Grayscale and our investors, but for the investment and crypto communities as a whole. The panel of judges unanimously agreed with us three to zero that the arguments we put forward in front of the court were such that the SEC acted arbitrarily and capriciously by approving the bitcoin futures products, but not approving bitcoin spot products like GBTC's conversion.\n\nAnd we really demonstrated-- or rather, the SEC didn't have a good explanation as how to make a distinction between these two product types given that they both derive their pricing from the same underlying Bitcoin market. And so this is a really, really important milestone on GBTC's path to eventually converting to an ETF.\n\n- And so walk us through the timeline from this point. How soon could we see the actual spot ETF come forward?\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: Well, so today is day one of a 45-day period during which the SEC can actually request a rehearing of the case.\n\n- OK.\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: So we have to be a little bit patient. We have to follow the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure here. And ultimately, the court will be issuing a final mandate that will detail the operational next steps. In the interim, however, though, of course, our legal teams will be proactively working with the SEC to try and make for an expeditious as possible conversion of GBTC to an ETF.\n\n- Now Michael, I do have to ask. If the floodgates do open and this is finally approved, how will you differentiate your product from some of the other ones that have also been applying for spot bitcoin ETFs?\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: You know, it's a great question, Rachelle. And there's actually already quite a bit of differentiation. GBTC is just a couple weeks away from celebrating its 10th anniversary. And that's 10 years of, you know, operating within the digital asset ecosystem. Custody, audits, accounting, disclosure, creations, investor, disclosures, tax treatment. All of these things are really core to running GBTC every single day.\n\nAnd in contrast, a lot of the other products seeking to come to market are merely just ideas. They're just ideas on paper. They're just filings. So in a lot of ways, GBTC has paved the way for a lot of the other issuers to even think about bringing their products to market, making use of GBTC's operations, disclosures, financial reporting, et cetera. And I think when investors do have a choice about which product to invest in, certainly thinking about a crypto native asset manager, a product that has billions of assets, hundreds of millions of dollars of daily trading volume. You know, these are the types of distinctions that I think investors will be paying attention to. But ultimately, we do believe investors should have choice.\n\n- So is this ruling enough to really kind of overshadow some of the crypto winter detractors to cryptocurrency, whether that's SBF and FTX and what's taking place there, or whether that's the algorithmic stablecoin debacles of last year? And the depegging, basically, to the dollar. Is this enough for investors and for the sentiment that's moved forward and had to navigate so many of these issues?\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: Certainly. I think investors are paying attention to the fact that crypto has been one of the best performing assets year to date. They're looking at not only the Grayscale victory, they're looking at the recent ripple victory in court. They're looking at the pending legislation that's being worked on in Washington, both around stablecoins, as you mentioned, as well as looking more at market structure.\n\nAnd it's encouraging from my seat having been in crypto now for almost a decade to actually see crypto becoming a nonpartisan issue. To see both sides of the aisle working on legislation. Their constituents are getting involved in crypto. They're getting involved in the name of investor protection. They realize investors are going to be involved in this asset class no matter what.\n\nAnd so I am very encouraged that we will have some progress around a lot of these in the weeks and months to come.\n\n- Who does this benefit the most? Who stands to benefit? Is it the retail investor that has been, you know, bullish on Bitcoin for the past 10 years, say? As long as you've been involved. Or is it the institutions now and making this more accessible and them being able to make sure that they've seen some type of revenue come through as a result of any products or assets that they might bring to market.\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: You know, ultimately, I think an ETF is a wrapper that is tried and true. And it's been used for everything from gold and other commodities to equities to, you know, sub themes. I think there's no exception when it comes to Bitcoin, right? Investors appreciate the ETF wrapper as a way to give them greater protections. And this is a wrapper that's used both by retail investors as well as institutions.\n\nSo I think this is an overall win for the investment community as a whole if we move forward with seeing these spot bitcoin products like GBTC converting and coming into the market.\n\n- And Michael, I do have to ask. Because when you think of where Bitcoin and crypto started and now you have this influx of institutional investors and them waiting for the next catalyst, whether it be Bitcoin, halving. What do you think is going to be the next catalyst in the crypto investment space?\n\nMICHAEL SONNEHSHEIN: Well, I actually think, Rachelle, you nailed it. One of the things that we and our investors are very focused on is the next Bitcoin halving that's slated to come around early next summer. And as we think about both that as well as the regulatory and legislative landscape I just mentioned, I do think that it, you know, portends for an environment around crypto like we actually haven't seen before. And some catalysts that could be really, really unique to continuing to the staying power of the asset class."

        "title": "Hashdex aims for first US spot bitcoin approval with novel filing - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nA little-known Brazilian asset manager has come up with a novel solution that might see it elbow in front of much larger rivals such as BlackRock and Ark to gain approval for the first US spot bitcoin exchange traded fund.\n\nHashdex\u2019s move attempts to assuage the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s concerns around the risk of manipulation in the spot bitcoin market.\n\nWhile rival applicants such as BlackRock are proposing to establish a \u201csurveillance-sharing agreement\u201d with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to detect any potential fraud, Hashdex instead says that the calculation of its ETF\u2019s net asset value would be derived from the CME market\u2019s bitcoin futures curve.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange has filed with the SEC to allow Hashdex to convert its existing NYSE Arca exchange-listed $3mn Bitcoin Futures ETF (DEFI) into a spot Hashdex Bitcoin ETF.\n\nHashdex\u2019s application comes amid rising speculation that US regulators are about to end their decade-long resistance to the creation of spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 which invest in the \u201cphysical\u201d cryptocurrency, rather than futures contracts \u2014 since BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, filed an application to launch such an ETF in June.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s move ushered in a 21st century-style gold rush as big-name rival managers such as Ark Investment Management, Fidelity, Invesco, WisdomTree, VanEck, Valkyrie Investments and Bitwise refiled their applications to the SEC in the hope that BlackRock\u2019s filing would open the regulator\u2019s door.\n\nThe SEC is still reviewing the filings, leaving the industry guessing as to whether or not it will permit any spot bitcoin ETFs, a structure it has objected to on the grounds that bitcoin is traded on unregulated exchanges that may potentially be susceptible to manipulation or fraud.\n\nIf the SEC is willing to relent, however, it would mean all these household names could yet be pipped to the post by Hashdex \u2014 a Brazilian cryptocurrency house that currently manages just $435mn across Latin America, Europe and the US \u2014 less than 1/20,000th of BlackRock\u2019s assets under management of $9.4tn.\n\nDEFI is currently by far the smallest of four bitcoin futures ETFs trading in the US, a structure the SEC has permitted because futures contracts are listed and traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a regulated market. The SEC believes this arrangement provides enough surveillance to avoid the risk of investors being harmed by criminal activity.\n\nThe Hashdex ETF would hold a mixture of bitcoin futures contracts, spot bitcoin and cash. It would buy and sell physical bitcoin via the CME\u2019s Exchange for Physical Transactions, a type of private agreement between two parties to trade a futures position for the underlying asset. These transactions are subject to the CME\u2019s market surveillance.\n\nAs such, \u201cany attempt to manipulate the price of the fund would require influencing the futures curve on the CME market\u201d, a market the SEC is happy to let underpin pricing for the existing quartet of bitcoin futures ETFs, the filing said.\n\nNate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, a financial adviser, described the Hashdex/NYSE proposal as a \u201cbrilliant move\u201d.\n\nA second factor crucially important to the filing is that DEFI is structured under the 1933 Securities Act, rather than the 1940 Investment Act favoured by many ETFs, including its rival bitcoin futures funds.\n\nThe regulated investment companies structured under the 1940 Act are only permitted to invest in securities, not commodities.\n\nHowever, the grantor trusts and commodity pools created under the 1933 Act are permitted to invest in commodities, hence ETFs such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) are structured under this format.\n\nThis is relevant because Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, has stipulated that bitcoin is a commodity, not a security \u2014 even though he believes most other cryptocurrencies are securities.\n\nIf the SEC does relent on spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 or is forced to change tack if it loses an ongoing court case with Grayscale, which is suing the regulator for the right to convert its existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF \u2014 this could potentially hand an advantage to Hashdex because of its 1933 Act structure.\n\nThere is a school of thought that it would be quicker to convert an existing fund to start trading in spot bitcoin than to launch a new vehicle from scratch.\n\n\u201cIn the event the SEC approves a spot bitcoin, DEFI can simply convert from futures to physical because its structure allows it to hold either futures or physical assets \u2014 as with most commodities ETFs,\u201d said Cinthia Murphy, director of research at the ETF Think Tank, the research division of Tidal Financial Group.\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of filings that need to take place for a \u201833 Act to convert, but once approved DEFI could convert to spot next day post SEC approval,\u201d she added.\n\nThis option would not be available for other existing bitcoin futures ETFs such as the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), Murphy said.\n\n\u201c[19]40 Act funds can\u2019t hold physical assets, only securities, so a conversion isn\u2019t possible. We are likely to see a line-up of \u201833 Act spot bitcoin funds come to market, as opposed to conversions of existing funds due to these regulatory restrictions associated with \u201840 Act funds.\u201d\n\nBeing first may prove to be beneficial. BITO, which beat rival products from VanEck, Valkyrie and the Hashdex ETF to market when it launched in October 2021, currently holds $942mn of the $1.01bn in the segment.\n\nHowever, in this case investors may choose to wait for the launch of similar products from household names such as BlackRock if they believe they will follow on soon after."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices jumped when a judge sided with Grayscale in its bid to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF. The possibility of an ETF is not the only thing to watch when it comes to the cryptocurrency though. Bitcoin is in a \"new world now,\" Axios Crypto Reporter Brady Dale tells Yahoo Finance Live. \"We're in a world that bitcoin has never seen before. What's different about this world is were no longer under zero interest rate policy,\" Dale says. Dale notes that it is normal to not be in a zero interest rate policy environment, but that \"it just hasn't been for a very long time.\"\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to regulation, Dale, who also wrote the book SBF: How The FTX Bankruptcy Unwound Crypto's Very Bad Good Guy, says that he thinks \"this SEC is going to fight crypto in every possible way it can, but Congress really wants to change the rules. And if Congress changes the rules, the SEC has to follow.\"\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- In terms of the tokens themselves, we do see analysts sort of on the fence about what's actually going to happen from here. There's always these very lofty valuations as to where Bitcoin is going to go, but what's the reality showing us right now?\n\nBRADY DALE: I love this question, Rachelle. So there's a really exciting answer to this question, I think. We are in a new world, at least in terms of Bitcoin now, that we're in a world that Bitcoin has never seen before. And what's different about this world is we're no longer under zero interest rate policy. Bitcoin was created under zero interest rate policy, every single boom we've had so far has been in a zero interest rate environment, and now there's actually yields that investors can get like off of treasuries. I mean, that's the thing everyone's got to compete with.\n\nAnd so Bitcoin has never been up against this environment before, it's a completely different world. I mean, it is the normal world. It's the way that investing has been in the United States for most of time, but it just hasn't been for a very long time since the Great Recession.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo the next big boom, I think it'll probably come. But it could be more muted this time because investors aren't piling into risk assets in quite the same way now that they have actual yields they can get off of treasuries again.\n\n- But does it take other cryptocurrencies with it or is it just all Bitcoin? And that is even though of course, is the largest market cap of the total crypto market cap right now, is it just zero sum Bitcoin after a ruling like this?\n\nBRADY DALE: Oh, I can't imagine a world in which a boom in Bitcoin doesn't yield a boom in everything else just like it always does, yeah.\n\n- Sure.\n\n- And we know that when it came to even classifying Bitcoin versus other cryptos as securities versus assets Bitcoin, has seemed to be in its own lane at the moment. Do we see that changing as we look at some of the potential regulation or sort of regulation by violation as we've been seeing when it comes to some of these exchanges and tokens? Do we expect more of that any standouts coming ahead for you?\n\nBRADY DALE: Well, I mean, the SEC's other big loss this year was its the decision on XRP where the courts found that XRP wasn't a security, which a lot of people have questions about that ruling and the SEC is going to try to appeal it, but we also have Congress looking to create a new definition for different kinds of cryptocurrencies. And so this world in which Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that is not a security, it's hard to imagine that lasting forever. The question is just how long until a few other cryptocurrencies get the green light to trade normally like Bitcoin has.\n\n- And so is this for an industry that's saying regulate us, regulate us, regulate us so we know how we can move forward with the necessary boundaries, is this the first piece where we see this opening up a floodgate of other regulation that then paves the way for people to know how they can engage with and for companies who are trying to introduce assets to know how they can engage with consumers as well?\n\nBRADY DALE: Well, I still think this SEC is going to fight crypto in every possible way it can, but Congress really wants to change the rules. And if Congress changes the rules, SEC has to follow. So I guess, in terms of like really giving the industry a path forward, my bet is either on Congress acting or a new president. I don't know that Gary Gensler as SEC is ever going to like, create that path for cryptocurrency. So they have to wait a while if it's just a regulation question.\n\n- Does that mean crypto is on the ballot in '24?\n\nBRADY DALE: I mean, it's definitely a voting issue for some people. I don't think it's going to decide the election.\n\n- Not everybody, yeah."

        "content": "Crypto is a volatile place. Money can be as easily lost as made through the ups and downs of Bitcoin and the wider market, and there are massive decisions to make. Should you just hodl \u2014 invest and do nothing \u2014 or actively trade the market? How many coins should your portfolio hold? Self-custody or keep your funds on an exchange with pre-determined stop losses?\n\nBasically, how do you protect your stack from the million and one things that can go wrong? We asked Bitcoin OGs and experts in the space for their advice and opinions.\n\nWalk before you can run\n\nWhen faced with the question of how best to protect your crypto, OG Brock Pierce is circumspect. The former presidential candidate and co-founder of Tether and Block.one points out that not everyone is in the same place.\n\n\u201cEarly noobs looking to begin their journey might go to Coinbase and purchase their first $20 or $50 worth of crypto, and it\u2019s not an investment in crypto, but an investment in yourself. However, the moment you have a material investment \u2013 and that is a different amount for everybody \u2013 then it\u2019s important to understand the basics of hodling and investing in crypto,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always better to walk before you can run, to walk in baby steps and don\u2019t let FOMO (fear of missing out) cloud your judgment. This is a marathon, a long game, so take you time and be informed.\u201d\n\nSelf-custody for safety\n\nPierce repeats the mantra, \u201cNot your keys, not your coins.\u201d This is one of the most widespread pieces of wisdom in the world of crypto, where people are encouraged to take responsibility for holding their own crypto rather than outsourcing it to an exchange that can get hacked.\n\nBut there are dangers with this approach, too, and if something goes wrong, there is no centralized bank authority to reset the passwords or refund money lost to scams. It\u2019s like holding cash under the mattress \u2014 the entire responsibility rests with you \u2014 and is referred to as self-custody in crypto.\n\nItai Avneri, deputy CEO and chief operating officer at INX Limited (Supplied)\n\nSelf-custody is the key to safe trading, according to Itai Avneri, deputy CEO and chief operating officer at INX Limited, the first and only fully regulated, end-to-end platform for listing and trading both SEC-registered security tokens and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cSelf-custody is the key here. Especially when thinking about digital securities and not just crypto. Trading on a centralized exchange that provides the confidence and protection of regulation and, at the same time, trading in a decentralized manner when the customer holds his / her own assets. Generally speaking, your wallet, your keys, your assets. This is the best way to protect yourself from a sudden hold on withdrawals or other events we witnessed in the past year,\u201d Avneri says.\n\nBut Bitcoin billionaire Tim Draper of Draper VC says that while that\u2019s true, institutions aren\u2019t keeping funds on a Ledger in a drawer.\n\n\u201cI no longer believe that my dollars in the bank are very safe. They are subject to political winds and inflation,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe safest personal money is BOL\u2014Bitcoin on Ledger. The safest institutional money is BAC\u2014 Bitcoin at Coinbase,\u201d Draper continues.\n\nTim Draper, founder of Draper VC, chatting with journalist Jillian Godsil.\n\nDiversification: Don\u2019t just buy eggs\n\nPierce points out that people advanced in sophistication can look at investigating yield farming or decentralized finance. This allows people to not only protect their crypto but also to look at increasing it through earning yields \u2014 but again, this involves risk.\n\nHe emphasizes the importance of investing in your own education and notes the importance of diversification.\n\nBrock Pierce, chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation (Supplied)\n\n\u201cIf you are participating in those markets, then you by necessity take on the counterparty risk associated with those platforms, and how you mitigate those risks is through diversification, but not having all your eggs in one basket. If any one asset fell, it won\u2019t wreck (rekt) your entire portfolio.\u201d\n\nDiversification in crypto is tricky, as Bitcoin and the rest of the market tend to move up and down at the same time. But Pierce warns against putting too much money in more volatile coins, for example, memecoins, in case of a downturn where the pain will be magnified.\n\nAndrew Latham, a certified financial planner based in Rolesville, North Carolina and the director of content for financial websiteSuperMoney.com, echoes Pierce\u2019s restraint and suggests looking outside of crypto as well.\n\n\u201cThe key to surviving market downturns is diversification and a disciplined approach. Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading your investments across various asset classes can help cushion against volatility. Keep a disciplined approach to crypto investing, focusing on long-term goals over short-term market fluctuations.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd while crypto investing is often a little bit too interesting for its good, he says successful investing is often the opposite.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the old adage goes, \u2018Investing should be more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take $800 and go to Las Vegas,\u2019\u201d Latham says.\n\nHigh-conviction bets\n\nSometimes, it makes sense to be overweight in a blue chip, market-leading token though, as Warren Buffett\u2019s 50% portfolio allocation to Apple shows. There are plenty of Bitcoin-only hodlers, but Lakov Levin, the co-founder of the new DeFi investment platform Locus Finance, leans heavily on Ethereum.\n\nLevin suggests: \u201cEthereum is the blockchain, which is used as the fundament for the financial evolution of the 21st century. It is a hub for hundreds of protocols that build value for its users. Holding Ethereum is similar to holding a fraction of the internet and value it provides to users. It is truly a remarkable financial opportunity.\u201d\n\nLevin notes that Ethereum\u2019s hodlers can stake their assets and receive 5% APR in ETH itself and points out the \u201cEthereum blockchain burns fees for each transaction made on the blockchain, which makes Ethereum a deflationary asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not think that ever in human history we saw a deflationary asset that generates consistent yield and has potential for such innovation,\u201d concludes Levin.\n\nA stop loss can prevent further losses. (Pexels)\n\nA tool to stop losses\n\nPierce is sanguine about overall market dumps if you are positioned properly.\n\n\u201cIf the market falls by 10%, take the hit using something like a stop loss, and try to recover in the next run.\u201d\n\nA stop-loss is a risk management tool that automatically sells a token once it reaches a certain floor \u2013 predetermined by the user. It is designed to limit losses but can be a blunt tool in the crypto world, where movements of 10% are common and could see all assets dumped as a result.\n\nLakov Levin, a co-founder of Locus Finance (Supplied)\n\nLevin is cautiously bullish on stop losses, which basically allow traders to close a trading position at a specific price.\n\n\u201cThe effectiveness of any tool lies in the hands of those who use it. The most important thing about \u2018stop losses\u2019 is the feeling of control, which protects from the anxiety of being in the market.\n\nOne of the scenarios that stop losses is the management of hypotheses on market behavior. When entering a trade, a trader has a hypothesis of the behavior of the market, which leads to opening a trading position.\n\n\u201cStop losses allow you to pick the price where your thesis is rejected by the market and limit your loss, which is a must thing to have for long-term trading. But \u2018stop losses\u2019 do not save from cognitive biases, which heavily affect trading. In this case, a trader may re-enter trade a few times, breaking his own rules under the influence of greed or fear. It is important to have discipline to follow your own rules.\n\n\u201cOne of the rules that I used when trading is when hit by stop loss, I take a break from trading this asset,\u201d says Levin.\n\nPierce is not an active trader and sees himself more as a long-term participant in the market. He appreciates that market volatility is not a negative thing and that tremendous wealth is made in volatile markets \u2014 the more movement, the more opportunity.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not for the faint of heart. You know, you\u2019re riding a roller coaster ride almost every day,\u201d says Pierce.\n\nOptions can protect against extreme volatility\n\nAll-time highs \u2013 and all-time lows. Recent reports in The Wall Street Journal point to SpaceX writing down the value of its Bitcoin holdings by $373 million. It is currently unclear whether SpaceX sold or merely reduced the value of its digital assets in its accounts. This may cause difficulty in the future, as U.S. accounting rules dictate that once written down, the value of Bitcoin on company balance sheets cannot be adjusted upward, even if its price rises.\n\nThe subsequent downward movement took many by surprise \u2014 established investors and newbies alike. What other tools are available to users to protect their crypto? Well, a 50-year-old model created by Nobel-prize-winning professors could be an option.\n\nOptions trading gives the trader the right or obligation to buy or sell a specific security on a specific date at a specific price \u2013 it\u2019s a contract that\u2019s linked to an underlying asset such as a stock or security. Since 1973, options have been priced using the Black-Scholes model originally authored by two university professors. This mathematical equation estimates the theoretical value of assets based on implied volatility, taking into account the impact of time and other risk values. It is to this day regarded as one of the best ways to price an option contract.\n\nIn 1973 two finance geeks, Black and Scholes, created a financial model used to price risk and volatility.\n\n\n\nIt gave birth to the $13tr options market and won the Nobel Prize for Economics.\n\n\n\n50 years later, Bumper brings it up to the age of DeFi, a breakthrough in risk management. pic.twitter.com/ZxNqROwQPV \u2014 Gareth Ward (@S_Boomerang) August 25, 2023\n\nAsked if he might consider using a tool like options, Pierce is cagey. He reckons that leverage is the demise of most people\u2019s wealth. Leverage is the use of borrowed funds to increase one\u2019s trading position beyond what would be available from one\u2019s cash balance alone.\n\n\u201cBe very careful playing with leverage. It\u2019s a tool for hedging to try and achieve great gains but can be the thing that creates more problems if you are not a skilled trader.\u201d\n\nPierce has bought into options in the past \u2013 a few times where he tried to swing for the fences with leveraged option bets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not worked out well, for me, because one of my problems is I\u2019m so close to the market, that the markets are not as rational.\u201d\n\nPierce quotes the recent SEC/Ripple legal action. He didn\u2019t trade on this occasion, but if he had, he would have bet on an altcoin bull run.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen. If I had followed my gut, then I would have bought and been wrecked the next day.\u201d\n\nAs Pierce said, that\u2019s why he\u2019s not an active trader.\n\nStop losses and options?\n\nA new protocol called Bumper is launching this month, claiming to provide a safety net for downward volatility. It combines stop losses and options in a way that co-founder Jonathan DeCarteret claims is cheaper and more efficient than both those traditional tools.\n\nJonathan DeCarteret, CEO of Bumper (Supplied)\n\nBumper\u2019s backtested economic simulations claim a yield improvement of 46.2% over options pricing during the 2022 bear market. This is demonstrated through a historic simulation report audited by Cryptecon and CADlabs.\n\n\u201cDecentralised Finance (DeFi) typically has low latency and high frequency of liquidity, which poses certain complexities for the model.\n\n\u201cOption desks make great use of pricing risk but have to add their costs on top. Bumper evolves the now half-century-old Black-Scholes equation to leverage all the unique properties of DeFi, such as pooled liquidity, smart contracts and protocol composability. Two years ago, we raised $20 million in funding to create a superior crypto equivalent,\u201d says DeCarteret.\n\nDon\u2019t fall foul of criminal scams\n\nThe membership program Crytolock.ai enables users to save up to 90% of compliance and recovery expenses in case of a crypto breach. Not surprisingly, CEO Roger Ying says to focus on prevention, detection and recovery.\n\nRoger Ying, CEO of Crytolock.ai (Supplied)\n\n\u201cCrypto users need to be educated on ways to prevent, secure and make sure they are not transacting with illicit entities otherwise, they may be implicated in a crypto crime,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, there are a growing number of ways to monitor your crypto on the blockchain and be immediately notified of unintended transactions and stop them before they get confirmed.\u201d He adds that if you still end up the \u201cvictim of a hack or rug pull, understanding the necessary processes to recover crypto is very important both in time and expenditure savings.\u201d\n\nHodling as a safe course\n\nOf course, hodling large-cap cryptocurrencies is probably the safest and easiest way to maintain a position. Pierce recommends using cold storage provided by hardware wallets as a safe way to keep crypto.\n\n\u201cBack in the day when I started, we used paper wallets. You\u2019d have a new device, and you\u2019d print out the keys, laminate the paper, and chuck it into a safe.\u201d\n\nSorkin is very direct in his hodling actions:\n\n\u201cBuy ETH, stake it in Lido, receive LDO and find ways to stake LDO. Otherwise just buy Bitcoin and forget about it completely until late 2024 when halving of BTC happens.\u201d\n\nLatham says the key to hodling is patience and conviction. \u201cInvest only in cryptocurrencies that you believe have long-term potential and can withstand market downturns. Regularly review your holdings to ensure they still align with your investment goals. Time in the market does beat timing the market, but that only works when you pick cryptocurrencies that don\u2019t flop, so it\u2019s crucial to vet your investments carefully.\u201d"

        "content": "The Bitcoin (BTC) market is booming, and cryptocurrency has transitioned from a niche interest for tech enthusiasts to a legitimate alternative to fiat currency and traditional asset classes. One of the first steps in buying, trading and using Bitcoin is choosing a Bitcoin wallet, and there are many different types of wallets out there. Here's an overview of the options:\n\nIntroduction to Bitcoin Wallets\n\nWhat Is a Bitcoin Wallet?\n\nBitcoin wallets are software applications or hardware devices used to store Bitcoin. Instead of storing hard currency, Bitcoin wallets store the private keys needed to send or receive cryptocurrency. Bitcoin wallets can be hardware devices similar to USB sticks, or they can be digital apps accessed on a smartphone or other device.\n\nImportance of Bitcoin Wallets\n\nBecause there is no physical Bitcoin, digital access to the cryptocurrency must be stored in some form of wallet. Anyone with access to a wallet\u2019s private keys \u2013 a long series of alphanumeric characters \u2013 has access to all the cryptocurrency stored using the wallet. While the Bitcoin blockchain is extremely secure, a crypto owner's stake is only as secure as the private key and the wallet in which it's stored.\n\nUnderstanding Different Types of Bitcoin Wallets\n\nCrypto wallets help Bitcoin users interact with the blockchain network, and there are several different types of wallets. Bitcoin wallets are broken into two main categories: hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets, or Bitcoin wallets connected to the internet, typically make it faster and easier for users to trade and spend their Bitcoin. Cold wallets, or wallets not connected to the internet, are more secure compared to hot wallets, but they typically make it more difficult for users to use their Bitcoin.\n\nHardware Wallet\n\nHardware wallets are physical, cold storage devices that keep a Bitcoin user's private keys safe and offline. Hardware wallets are generally extremely secure compared to hot wallets because hackers and cybercriminals do not have access to cold wallets. However, hardware wallets can be lost or stolen in the physical world, just like a traditional wallet.\n\nDesktop Wallet\n\nA desktop wallet allows Bitcoin users to store and manage private keys securely on a personal computer hard drive. A user simply downloads desktop wallet software and installs it on their PC just like you would install any other application. Desktop wallets are typically hot wallets and can be ideal for Bitcoin users who often make crypto transactions on a PC. However, they are less secure than hardware wallets.\n\nWeb Wallet\n\nWeb wallets are hot wallets that store a user's private keys on a server, and users can access them as long as they have access to the internet. Web wallets are controlled by a cryptocurrency exchange or other third-party entity, and users access them by signing in using an ID and password or other means of identification. Web wallets can be extremely convenient, but they are only as secure as the third party managing them.\n\nMobile Wallet\n\nA mobile Bitcoin wallet is an app that stores private keys on a smartphone, allowing users to easily use or trade crypto on the go. Mobile wallets are hot wallets, and they come with all the risks associated with malware or other cyberattacks. However, mobile wallets can be extremely convenient for using crypto as a payment method, including via QR code scans.\n\nPaper Wallet\n\nPaper wallets are cold storage wallets that are created using a key generator program that prints public and private key pairs used to make crypto transactions. Once these keys are printed, the paper wallet is essentially akin to paper fiat currency. If your paper wallet is lost or stolen, the funds in it are gone just like a stolen $20 bill. Paper wallets were once the preferred method of cold storage in the crypto community, but they have now largely been replaced by hardware wallets.\n\n\n\nTop 5 Best Bitcoin Wallets\n\nThere are many different brands of Bitcoin wallets, and each has its unique pros and cons based on the type of wallet it is, the features it offers and its price.\n\nHardware Wallet: Trezor\n\nTrezor wallets are known for their advanced security features, such as Shamir Backup for lost, broken or stolen devices. Trezor wallets are also very affordable, starting at only $69 for the Trezor Model One. In addition to Bitcoin, Trezor wallets support roughly 1,000 other popular cryptos as well, including Ethereum, Cardano and Solana.\n\nDesktop Wallet: Exodus Wallet\n\nExodus Wallet is a user-friendly hot storage wallet that is known for its functionality. In addition to its desktop wallet, Exodus users can access their wallets via mobile devices and web extensions. Exodus is also free to use, but critics have pointed out it doesn't have as many security features as other leading wallets.\n\nWeb Wallet: Coinbase Wallet\n\nCoinbase Global Inc. (ticker: COIN) operates one of the largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, and its Coinbase Wallet web wallet is one of three crypto wallets it offers to its users. Coinbase Wallet does not offer a desktop application, but its simple, highly functional mobile app and web browser extension support thousands of digital assets, including non-fungible tokens. In addition, Coinbase Wallet allows staking directly from the wallet, and its compatibility with Ledger \u2013 another wallet brand \u2013 allows users to easily transition from hot storage to cold storage.\n\nMobile Wallet: Trust Wallet\n\nTrust Wallet is a popular mobile Bitcoin wallet that has millions of users, supports more than 4.5 million tokens and can interact with 65 different blockchain networks. Trust Wallet is also the official digital wallet of Binance, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges. Trust Wallet has an intuitive interface and built-in staking capabilities, but it does not have a cold storage feature.\n\nPaper Wallet: BitAddress\n\nBitAddress is a popular crypto platform that generates paper wallets for Bitcoin. BitAddress users can quickly and easily print out paper wallets with private and public keys that can used to securely store their Bitcoin offline. BitAddress paper wallets are convenient for new crypto users or users who do not trust digital storage, but they can be easily lost or stolen and are generally considered inferior to other modern cold storage methods.\n\nThe Security Aspect of Bitcoin Wallets\n\nThe decentralized nature of blockchain networks promises users an unprecedented level of security when it comes to verifying and securing cryptocurrency transactions. However, while the Bitcoin blockchain network itself is extremely secure, a Bitcoin user's cryptocurrency is only as secure as the wallet in which it is stored. Many cryptocurrency wallets use advanced security features to protect their contents, including multifactor authentication, multi-signature and seed phrase security.\n\nImproving Your Wallet's Security\n\nThere's no way to make a Bitcoin wallet 100% safe and secure, but there are plenty of steps to improve security and minimize risk. Cold storage eliminates the possibility of hacking or online access to your wallet. In addition, Bitcoin users should always use only reputable wallet providers that prioritize security features, and they should regularly change their wallet passwords.\n\nContingency Plans for Wallet Security\n\nNo matter how many security features your wallet has, loss, theft or even personal incapacitation can have severe consequences when it comes to accessing your Bitcoin holdings. Well before you forget or lose access to a crypto wallet, you should clearly document how to access private keys or backups and record the specifics of the recovery process along with instructions on how to use any recovery tools. If you become unable to manage your wallet or forget what to do when you lose access, a contingency plan can help you or a close, trusted friend or family member recover your crypto assets.\n\nHow to Choose the Best Bitcoin Wallet\n\nMuch like cryptocurrencies themselves, identifying the best cryptocurrency wallets largely involves weighing a trade-off between security and convenience. Individual investors will have different levels of risk aversion and different goals in mind for their Bitcoin that will influence their wallet priorities. In addition, users should consider the features different wallets offer, the usability of the wallets based on their level of experience and the costs or fees involved.\n\nTakeaway"

        "content": "What happened\n\nCryptocurrencies have rallied sharply this week, but that rally cooled off over the last 24 hours. Tuesday's jump was driven by Grayscale's win over the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) in court, which could pave the way for more crypto ETFs, but the rally hasn't lasted.\n\nBetween noon ET on Tuesday and 3:15 p.m. ET on Wednesday, the value of Bitcoin (BTC -0.26%) fell 2.7%, Ethereum (ETH -1.47%) was down 1.9%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 8.23%) dropped 2.1%. But the cryptocurrencies are up 2.9%, 1.4%, and 2.2% over the past week, so there has been a rally overall.\n\nSo what\n\nThe court's ruling yesterday that the SEC must review the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust application to convert into an ETF could pave the way for more Bitcoin ETFs. And that could open up more crypto ETFs for Ethereum or even Dogecoin.\n\nWhat the judge's ruling doesn't guarantee is that any ETFs will actually be approved. The SEC just needs to review the application and treat it like any other Bitcoin ETF application, which hasn't yet been approved. So, it's back to a waiting game for investors.\n\nWhat we have seen is repeated wins for the crypto industry in court. The Ripple ruling in July paved the way for cryptocurrencies to be regulated more like commodities rather than securities, and now trading options may be opening up via ETFs.\n\nIt's not clear when there will be a final ruling on a Bitcoin ETF or if an answer on what's a commodity and what's a security will be coming, but this was seen as a positive sign for the industry.\n\nNow what\n\nThe bounce in values on Tuesday is what's reversing today. There was at least some hope that this would lead to more ETFs and more certainty for the industry, but as the market has processed the ruling, it's clear that's not what happened.\n\nThat said, the court being more friendly to the crypto industry should be an incremental positive long term. Trading has all but dried up for most cryptocurrencies, and that's left the industry in an uncertain place. The regulatory uncertainty hasn't helped, but if that gets answered, there's billions of dollars of investment that's gone into companies building on the blockchain. That's where the real innovation will take place that could cause values to increase.\n\nFor now, the market seems to be cautiously optimistic when there's a positive ruling, but the bounce doesn't last long because there's no fundamental change in the market. That's what's holding values back and why we get the pop and then the slow drop of the last 36 hours. Expect that trend to continue until there's regulatory clarity, which at this rate could still be years away."

        "title": "Bitcoin Briefly Breaks Above $28K After Grayscale's Court Win Over SEC - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Joining us now to discuss perhaps the most important thing. The crypto markets is Clara Mili Kai, co director of research. Welcome, Clara. Thank you. Happy to be here. It's our pleasure to have you here now. Bitcoin prices. Uh They did some somersaults as we know in the last 24 hours, they sold some 7% on Tuesday as traders reacted to this gray scale Bitcoin spot ETF court decision and you noted that liquidity remains thin. So is this sudden price movement sustainable? Well, what's interesting is we looked at the trade volume data today and I think trade volume overall historically is one of the best indicators for general engagement in Cryptocurrency markets. And what we found was trade volume only spiked to its highest level since the August 17th sell off, meaning it's only at its highest level over the past two weeks. Um And it's relatively low compared to other mini bull markets we've seen. Um But the good news is that we did see a spike in average trade size. That's chart that you see on the screen right now. Um This means that even though volumes were still low, um the average buy orders on average were larger, which means it could be a bit of whale activity that was reentering markets. But I think ultimately a lot of this price volatility. Bitcoin gained quite a bit, it crashed quite a bit on August 17th is due to underlying liquidity issues. We still have relatively low liquidity on order books which makes volatility a lot likelier. Yeah, you bring up this low liquidity, low capital in the market. We've been talking about catalysts on this show all week. What do you think it's gonna take to get new investors injecting capital into the market instead of just um these whales that you're speaking about? I mean, I think that a wave of ETF approvals could definitely be the bullish catalyst that crypto markets need right now. That would really open up a whole new class of investor to the space. Um But again, we're in the middle still of a sort of tumultuous period for the industry. There's quite a few bankruptcies and lawsuits that are ongoing, especially in the exchange space. Um And so I think we still need to wait and see how that resolves, especially in the United States. Yeah. Right. Uh You know, you also wrote uh that average trade size for Bitcoin is at its highest level since June, which means buyers were on average, placing larger orders. What does it really tell you about market sentiment? So I think average trade size, it typically correlates with a big market, uh, big market event. And when you see a spike in average trade size, it means that there were either a lot of large buy or sell orders. However, what we see that during a bull market, we typically see a prolonged increase in average trade size. So of course, over the past few months, past 6 to 8 months, we've seen a slow decrease. So any spike we see is good news. Um And I think that yesterday's uh price bump while it may be too early to tell if it's sustained and will get us past the 30 k price level. Um There are some small signs that suggest we could be seeing a slight reversal. I just want to take you through what happened in the minutes and let's say hours right after the result, the court order yesterday, uh initially, there was a bit of legal confusion about whether this was going to mean that the court had actually now approved, uh you know, a spot Bitcoin ETF and that's what it had ordered the SEC to, to basically do. And then later, it was kind of, you know, when the water has kind of calm down, everyone understood that. Well, this is just the case being one for the moment and now it goes back to the SEC, they have 23 options, uh one to review to come up with a different reason, et cetera. And that's when suddenly the market sentiment and, and Bitcoin prices went back down to, let's say a more nominal acceptable, uh less frenzy atmosphere. Is, is that something that you were seeing also? Yeah. Yeah, we were also seeing similar patterns and I think that's common every time you see either a price crash or a price bump, you often see a pullback uh to previous levels shortly after, especially uh in our current environment. It's, you know, liquidity is thin. And so you're seeing these wild uh price uh price swings uh pretty frequently these days. All right. And it's not always all about Bitcoin. Of course, you uh we're talking about lack of liquidity, lack of capital and Bitcoin markets. Uh What are you seeing with, with alt coins? I know two of the top meme coins by market cap and Pepe are down year to date. Um Are meme coins following a different trend here. What's going on outside of Bitcoin? I mean, meme coins are always following their own special trends. Um And I think with Pepe in particular on Monday, we had some of the founders news broke that they were selling a lot of their tokens and so that caused a huge price crash. We wrote about it in our Monday research note for Kai O. But ultimately, I think meme coins, they sort of run on their own clock. Uh You see, especially Doge coin, it's tightly correlated to anything happening with Elon Musk and Pepe. I guess has had some news events over the past few weeks causing it to diverge from what you see with Bitcoin and E now we're jumping a little bit all over the place here, but we of course, spoke to Grace Gill before this segment. Uh The court win ignited a trading frenzy with G BT C shares, pushing trading volume to the highest since June of 2022. What are your thoughts there? Um I mean, I think all the investors in gray scale, they're extremely happy with this news. It's been sort of a major headwind for institutions in the Cryptocurrency industry over the past few years, just the inability to redeem to redeem Bitcoin. And actually, it's been a bit, people have described it as a Bitcoin black hole. So it'll be very interesting to see what happened if they are able to convert into an ETF whether we'll see a lot of because this will actually enable Bitcoin redemptions and what will happen with these Bitcoin then. Um But overall investors are clearly happy with what's going on. Um And I think on the institutional side, it's probably one of the best news we've had so far this year, um especially as we've seen a lot of capital exit the market. All right, Clara, we are gonna have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining the show. It was wonderful seeing you again. Thank you. That was Clara Bed Kaiko, Director of Research."

        "title": "BTC Miners Struggle to Break Even: Cathedra Bitcoin Reports C$2.9 Million Loss - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The financial results of yet another publicly traded cryptocurrency miner showed that it is challenging to make a net profit under current market conditions. Cathedra Bitcoin Inc. (TSX: CBIT), a Toronto-based Bitcoin mining company, has disclosed its financial performance for Q2 2023. Despite the report revealing significant growth in mining output and revenue, the net loss still seems sizable.\n\nCathedra Bitcoin: Modest Growth in Profit and Decline in Net Loss\n\nIn Q2 2023, Cathedra Bitcoin mined 77.15 BTC, marking an increase of 19.5 BTC from the 57.65 BTC mined in the same period last year. This growth is attributed to the company's hash rate Hash Rate A hash rate is the measure of a cryptocurrency miner\u2019s performance and a key security metric. In the context of mining, the more hashing or computing power in a given network, the greater its security and its overall resistance to attackMining hashrate is a key security metric.

Hash rate is also a measurement of the output of a device that is used to add transactions to a blockchain Read this Term expansion from 231 PH/s to 382 PH/s. Despite a surge in the network mining difficulty and a drop in Bitcoin's average price, the company's revenue rose from C$2.5 million in Q2 2022 to C$2.9 million in Q2 2023.\n\nOn top of that, the company has significantly reduced its net loss. Last year, it was C$11.9 million for the three-month period ending in June, and it has now reduced to C$2.9 million. The net loss for the entire first half of the year was C$5.2 million, compared to C$15.8 million reported in the first half of 2022.\n\n\"Recent weeks have seen the improved bitcoin mining conditions of H1 2023 regress to levels comparable to the most challenging periods of Q4 2022. During this time, we remain focused on finding creative, capital-efficient ways to create value for our shareholders,\" the company commented in the official press release.\n\nHowever, this doesn't change the fact that Cathedra Bitcoin is another publicly traded crypto miner that recently published a financial report showing a net loss. The pattern is usually the same: companies are mining more Bitcoins but cannot achieve profitability.\n\nJust yesterday, companies like Canaan and Argo Blockchain released their reports. The former saw a quarterly revenue increase to $73.9 million, but this was significantly lower than the $245.9 million reported in Q2 2022. The latter reported a decline of 31% in revenue to $24 million for H1 2023. Riot Platforms Inc. and Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. also posted adverse financial outcomes for Q2 2023.\n\nThese companies are among five publicly-listed firms that have suffered a loss of $2.8 billion following a sharp decline in Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market in mid-August.\n\nSource: AltIndex\n\nDevelopment despite Difficult Conditions\n\nAlthough market conditions are not favorable, Cathedra Bitcoin is constantly trying to grow its business. The company managed its debts effectively, converting C$2.5 million of its 3.5% senior secured convertible debentures into 18.5 million common shares. As of the end of August 2023, the company holds approximately C$4.4 million in cash and Bitcoin Bitcoin While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we\u2019ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC\u2019s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John\u2019s.One could now argue that Read this Term, providing a solid liquidity position.\n\nThe company completed the deployment of Bitmain Antminer S19J Pro and XP machines at its data centers in Washington and a facility in Kentucky. A renewed hosting agreement with a partner in Tennessee and a new strategic partnership with 360 Mining in Texas further expanded its operational footprint.\n\n\"This focus is exemplified by our recent partnership with 360 Mining, under which we will continue to deploy idle hash rate and infrastructure with minimal capex, as well as our ongoing efforts to underclock our machines using custom firmware to ensure profitability. As always, we thank our shareholders for their continued support,\" the company added.\n\nCathedra Bitcoin aims to enhance its energy efficiency by underclocking its mining machines, thereby reducing the break-even hash price by 12%. This move is expected to maintain the machines' positive cash flow."

        "content": "What Is Bitcoin Mining? Bitcoin mining refers to the process of validating and recording transactions on the Bitcoin network. The primary purpose of Bitcoin mining is twofold: validating transactions to prevent fraud and adding new blocks to the blockchain, thereby creating new Bitcoins in a decentralized manner. Key Takeaways: The process of bitcoin mining involves the verification of new transactions against the Bitcoin network, which results in the production of new bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin mining is the process by which Bitcoin transactions are validated digitally on the Bitcoin network and added to the blockchain ledger.\n\nIt is done by solving complex cryptographic hash puzzles to verify blocks of transactions that are updated on the decentralized blockchain ledger. Solving these puzzles requires powerful computing power and sophisticated equipment. In return, miners are rewarded with Bitcoin, which is then released into circulation hence the name Bitcoin mining. Also Read: Blockchain Tutorial for Beginners to Advanced Level\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency that allows peer-to-peer transfers without any intermediaries such as banks, governments, agents, or brokers, using the underlying technology of blockchain. Anyone around the world on the network can transfer Bitcoins to someone else on the network regardless of geographic location; you just need to just open an account on the Bitcoin network and have some Bitcoins in it, and then you can transfer those Bitcoins. How do you get Bitcoins in your account? You can either purchase them online or mine them. Bitcoin can be used for online purchases and or as an investment instrument. Primarily it\u2019s used to buy goods and services. Bitcoin Advantages Compared to traditional fiat currencies, assets can be transferred faster on the bitcoin network. The system also has lower transaction fees, because it\u2019s decentralized and there are no intermediaries, and it is cryptographically secure\u2014the identities of the sender and the receiver are kept hidden, and it is impossible to counterfeit or hack the transactions. Plus, all the information is available on a public ledger, so anyone can view the transactions. Unveil the fascinating realm of Bitcoin mining while fortifying your cybersecurity expertise through our comprehensive cyber security bootcamp. Learn the intricacies of blockchain technology and cryptographic protocols that underpin cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, all while mastering the strategies to secure these decentralized systems. With hands-on training in ethical hacking, digital forensics, and network security, you'll be equipped to not only mine cryptocurrencies but also safeguard them from evolving cyber threats.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Is Crypto Mining? Cryptocurrency mining is a process of creating new digital \"coins.\" However, that is as far as simplicity goes. The process of recovering these coins requires solving complex puzzles, validating cryptocurrency transactions on a blockchain network and adding them to a distributed ledger to locate them.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain? As mentioned, blockchain is the underlying technology of bitcoin. Blockchain is a public distributed ledger in which transactions are recorded in chronological order. Any record or transaction added to the blockchain cannot be modified or altered, meaning transactions are safe from hacking. A block is the smallest unit of a blockchain, and it is a container that holds all the transaction details. A block has four fields, or primary attributes: Previous hash: This attribute stores the value of the hash of the previous block, and that's how the blocks are linked to one another. Data: This is the aggregated set of transactions included in this block\u2014the set of transactions that were mined and validated and included in the block. Nonce: In a \u201cproof of work\u201d consensus algorithm, which bitcoin uses, the nonce is a random value used to vary the output of the hash value. Every block is supposed to generate a hash value, and the nonce is the parameter that is used to generate that hash value. The proof of work is the process of transaction verification done in blockchain. Hash: This is the value obtained by passing the previous hash value, the data and the nonce through the SHA-256 algorithm; it is the digital signature of the block. SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash algorithm that produces a unique 256-bit alphanumeric hash value for any given input, and that is the unique feature of this cryptographic algorithm: Whatever input you give, it will always produce a 256-bit hash.\n\n3 Concepts of Blockchain To understand bitcoin mining, you have to first understand the three major concepts of blockchain. Public distributed ledger: A distributed ledger is a record of all transactions maintained in the blockchain network across the globe. In the network, the validation of transactions is done by bitcoin users. SHA-256: Blockchain prevents unauthorized access by using a hash function called SHA-256 to ensure that the blocks are kept secure. They are digitally signed. Their hash value, once generated, cannot be altered. SHA-256 takes an input string of any size and returns a fixed 256-bit output, and it is a one-way function\u2014you cannot derive the reverse of the input reverse fully from the output (what you have generated). Proof of work: In blockchain mining, miners validate transactions by solving a difficult mathematical puzzle called proof of work. To do that, the primary objective of the miner is to determine the nonce value, and that nonce value is the mathematical puzzle that miners are required to solve to generate a hash that is less than the target defined by the network for a particular block.\n\nBitcoin Profit and Bitcoin Mining Profitability Bitcoin Profit is an automated crypto robot that helps trade Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies to earn profit. It uses an AI algorithm to identify trading opportunities in the crypto market that can automatically close and open your trade, saving your time and manual intervention during trading. It claims that around 85% of its trades produce profits in normal market conditions. However, technical knowledge is required to calculate the profit generated through the Bitcoin mining process. Talking about the actual Bitcoin profit - the real money making - it depends upon the cost of the AISC hardware, electricity consumption, and the effectiveness of the mining software. Bitcoin Mining profitability has decreased in recent times compared to the previous years because of the rise in electricity costs, costlier hardware, difficulty in mining due to an increase in competition, and a decrease in the Bitcoin prices. Earlier, Bitcoin Mining was initiated using CPUs and easy AI Algorithms, making it profitable and less costly.

View all Related Programs\n\nBitcoin vs. Traditional Currencies While both Bitcoin and traditional currency are similar in that both are a store of value, they differ in many ways. First things first, Bitcoin is the first and most recognized cryptocurrency - a digital currency that is secured by cryptography. Traditional currency, also referred to as fiat money, is a government-issued and regulated currency. Some differences between Bitcoin and traditional currencies are illustrated in the table below. Bitcoin Traditional Currency Tangibility It is a virtual currency and can only be used in its digital form It is a physical currency in the form of notes and coins. However, we can use it in both physical and digital forms Regulation Issued through mining and controlled by a decentralized distributed network of computers Issued and controlled by central government authorities, i.e., central banks. Owing to this, the traditional currency is the legal tender in the country governed by the issuing authority. Governance Governed by a consensus mechanism in which the majority rules Purely governed by the central bank Value Value is backed by the trust of its users. The more users are willing to transact with Bitcoin, the more stable it becomes. Value is determined by forces of supply and demand and is thus vulnerable to inflation Supply Capped at 21 million bitcoin Fiat currency has no supply limit Validation of transactions Bitcoin transactions are validated using blockchain technology and so do not require an intermediary for validation Transactions involve an intermediary such as a bank or a payment provider Transaction fees Minimal or no associated fees as intermediaries have been eliminated Transactions attract considerable charges Transaction time and speed The transaction is almost always instantaneous or greatly depends on the network speed Transactions may take time before verification or before they reflect on the system Security The concepts of decentralization, cryptography, and consensus guarantee a secure network and security of bitcoin transactions Less secure as it can be negatively affected by fluctuations in government policies Reversals Bitcoin transactions cannot be charged back, reversed, or canceled Chargebacks, reversals, and cancellations are commonplace with traditional currency transactions\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Mining Work: Public Distributed Network, POW, The 64-Digit Hexadecimal Number (SHA-256 Algorithm) Blockchain is a decentralized peer-to-peer network that has been hailed as highly secure and transparent, hence trustworthy. This is because records in the blockchain network are secured using timestamps and cryptographic hash functions in such a way that after being added to the ledger, it is almost impossible and impractical to alter the transactions. At the core of blockchain security is the absence of centralized control. Here is a breakdown of what happens during bitcoin mining The Mining Requirements A bitcoin miner will first select their tools of the trade and set them up. These include: Hardware GPU (graphics processing unit), SSD for crypto mining, or ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit)\n\nMining software\n\nA wallet\n\nPreferred mining pool (if one chooses pool mining option instead of solo mining) Once all these are set up and the system fired up, it performs the mining process autonomously. Any other human involvement comes in the event of system or network failure, power outage, or regular system maintenance. Elements of a Bitcoin Transaction When a transaction is initiated in the bitcoin network, three elements are involved: A transaction input\n\nA transaction output\n\nThe transaction amount For every transaction input, a bitcoin mining software generates a unique cryptographic hash puzzle that is difficult to decode. The software then groups the number of transactions required to form a block into a Merkle tree. The Merkle Tree and the SHA-256 Algorithm A Merkle tree is a data structure of the hashes in a block and acts as a summary of all the transactions in the block. In the Merkle tree, hashes of individual transactions known as transaction IDs are paired repeatedly using the SHA-256 algorithm until only one hash identifies the entire tree. This hash is known as the Merkle root or root hash. The Merkle tree enables the efficient verification of transactions in the bitcoin network. The Block Header The Merkle root, the identifier of a Merkle tree, is stored in the block header. The block header contains information about the block and includes the following components: The version number of the bitcoin software\n\nThe hash of the previous block\n\nThe Merkle root (root hash)\n\nTimestamp\n\nCryptographic nonce\n\nThe target This is the information miners will use to solve the hash puzzle and add a block transaction. Solving the Hash Puzzle Miners must solve the hash puzzle by finding the hash below a given target through the difficulty requirement. The target, stored in the header, is expressed as a 67-digit number that will determine the mining difficulty based on the number of miners competing to solve a hash function. It is important to note that this difficulty adjusts after every 2016 blocks are created depending on how much time it took miners in the previous 2016 blocks to solve an equation. This also helps to maintain the rate at which transactions are appended in the blockchain at 10 minutes. To solve the hash puzzle, miners will try to calculate the hash of a block by adding a nonce to the block header repeatedly until the hash value yielded is less than the target. Once a mining computer solves the puzzle, a new block is successfully created that is validated in the Bitcoin network after a consensus between the nodes has been reached. When a block is validated, the transactions bundled in it are verified and the block is added to the chain. As indicated above, this happens every 10 minutes. As there will be many miners (systems) competing to solve the puzzle, the first miner to get the correct hash value earns a reward in Bitcoin. This process allows more Bitcoins in circulation.\n\nMining and Bitcoin Circulation Bitcoin\u2019s upper supply limit of 21 million bitcoin set by its source code by Satoshi Nakamoto, its inventor, is puzzling. However, experts have seen it as a huge advantage because the scarcity of supply breeds value and a stable price for the oldest crypto. From the genesis Bitcoin block mined in 2009 with 50 bitcoins, more bitcoins have since been mined and released into circulation. Bitcoin mining ensures that blocks of transactions are created and stacked in the right order in a way that can be traced and proven mathematically. With the creation of blocks comes bitcoins as a reward, which increases the number of bitcoins in circulation. Bitcoin architecture was structured ingeniously such that every 10 minutes, a block is discovered, and a fixed bitcoin award is offered for every block that is mined.\n\nPrevention of Hacking What if someone tries to hack the data? Blockchain, as the name implies, is a chain of blocks\u2014let\u2019s call the blocks A, B and C. Each block has solved a puzzle and generated a hash value of its own, which is its identifier. Now suppose a person tries to tamper with block B and change the data. The data is aggregated in the block, so if the data of the block changes, then the hash value that is the digital signature of the block will also change. It will therefore corrupt the chain after it\u2014the blocks ahead of block B will all get delinked, because the previous hash value of block C will not remain valid. For a hacker to make the entire blockchain valid for the block B that has been changed, he or she would have to change the hash value of all the blocks ahead of block B. This would require a huge amount of computing power and is next to impossible. With this method, blockchain is non-hackable and prevents data modification.\n\nWhy Mine Bitcoin? Let\u2019s be straight: people primarily mine Bitcoin to earn profits. Other than that, people who are curious about this technology and how it works enjoy experimenting with this relatively new technology.\n\nHow to Mine Bitcoin? The Bitcoin miners are suggested to use mining hardware, such as Ebang, Antminer, Minedollars, AvalonMiner, or more that generates new Bitcoins after every 10 minutes. To mine Bitcoin, the miner is advised to invest in a powerful setup designed specifically for mining cryptos. Excessive or advanced computer knowledge must be possessed to operate the hardware system. The user then has to create at least one Bitcoin wallet for Bitcoin Mining that is secured and convenient. Once the mining hardware is set up and the Bitcoin wallet is created, the miner must adopt strategies to install and configure the mining software. The miner has to apply technical knowledge to improve the mining capacity. The mining process then begins after the miner downloads a soft copy of the blockchain of Bitcoin and clicks on the start button. The miner needs to monitor the progress regularly to ensure that the mining application runs smoothly. However, the miner does not need to do anything manually and can rely on the mining hardware after the mining process is started. Because of the Bitcoin Mining process, new blocks are added to the blockchain. Also Read: 10 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Bitcoin\n\nHow to Mine Bitcoin at Home? Mining Bitcoins at home is challenging and requires certain steps to achieve good results. The first step is to set up the hardware properly and search for a strong power connection. The person then can create a mining wallet in any trading platform of their choice and join a mining pool to proceed further. The most important step is installing an effective mining software such as Awesome Miner, Easy Miner, and Pionex and then inserting the wallet details and the information about the mining pool. However, the hardware needed for mining is expensive, and everyone cannot afford it. Moreover, mining Bitcoins requires a lot of electricity consumption. Only people who have access to low-cost electricity can afford to mine Bitcoins at home. Therefore, Bitcoin Mining at home can be profitable but needs resources and efforts whose costs are huge.\n\nHow to Calculate Bitcoin profit? Keeping aside the actual Bitcoin profit earned by mining, miners have to perform a cost-benefit analysis to understand their break-even price before purchasing costly hardware or other mining equipment. To calculate the Bitcoin profit, one must analyze the amount spent purchasing Bitcoin currencies. The next step is to check how much 1 Bitcoin costs at the purchase and compare it with the current value. The differences between the current and old values will provide a clear idea about the amount of profit earned. Several factors that hinder Bitcoin's profit are: Cost of Power The price of electricity changes every season. Electricity is consumed not only to mine Bitcoins but also to prevent them from overheating and cooling them down. Time There is no time length for mining. Many miners mine 24x7 as they can afford the mining cost. Bitcoin value Changes in the Bitcoin value are ascertainable, affecting your Bitcoin profit and return on investment. Efficiency Difficulty in mining can arise due to slow computers, low voltage, or any other factor, affecting efficiency.\n\nHow Much Does a Miner Earn - Bitcoin Halving Bitcoin halving refers to the splitting of block rewards into half to mean that miners\u2019 reward for discovering a block is reduced by half. Halving exists to lower Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate and the rate at which new Bitcoins are released into circulation, keeping the price of Bitcoin stable. The halving event happens after every 210,000 blocks have been mined, which is roughly after every four years. The number of Bitcoins in circulation is calculated by the halving theory laid out by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin protocol. When Bitcoin was first launched, the reward for every block mined started at 50 Bitcoins. To date, three halving events have taken place, and the block reward went from 50 from 2009, 25 from 2012, 12.5 from 2016, to the current 6.25 BTC from 2020. The last Bitcoin halving event took place on May 11th, 2020. By September 2021, 18.828 million of the 21 million Bitcoin cap had been mined and released into circulation, accounting for roughly 89.7% of all the Bitcoins to be mined. The next Bitcoin halving event is expected to take place in the early months of the year 2024. Halving should continue until all blocks are mined, and the 21 million Bitcoin supply cap is attained sometime in 2140. After this, the Bitcoin miners will only earn from transaction fees.\n\nWhat Do I Need to Mine Bitcoins? Mining must have been a lot easier in the early days of its launch. As bitcoin and the blockchain concept were relatively new, mining was left to hobbyists on a discovery path. In fact, bitcoin\u2019s inventor Nakamoto mined the genesis block on a basic CPU. As bitcoin continues to gain wider adoption, it has also succeeded in drawing keen interest from investors, miners, and companies harnessing cryptocurrency as a mode of payment for products and services. With this, mining has become a very competitive undertaking, and the hardware and software demands for bitcoin mining are also more sophisticated. Today, bitcoin mining requires specialized tools, including: Hardware such as GPU (graphics processing unit), SSD for crypto mining, ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit), or the latest FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) chips. When purchasing mining hardware, it is important to consider two factors, their hash rate (performance) and electricity consumption.\n\nMining software such as ECOS, BeMine, and Kryptex Miner\n\nA bitcoin wallet from which an individual performs bitcoin transactions\n\nPreferred mining pool (if one chooses pool mining option instead of solo mining)\n\nIs Bitcoin Mining Profitable? Bitcoin Mining is not profitable for all individual miners except a few due to the complicated mining process and high costs. All the miners cannot spend huge amounts of dollars setting up the hardware. A cost-benefit analysis is performed to ascertain the profitability. The amount of electricity consumption in kWh, efficiency, difficulty, time taken to complete the mining process, and the Bitcoin value are deciding factors. The cost of setting up the hardware is very high, and it requires an application of a high level of technical expertise. All the miners are not well equipped with these applications, resulting in low profits for these individual miners. Because of this, miners are recommended to join mining pools where a group of miners can work together. By following this approach, Bitcoin miners will be able to increase their chances of earning more rewards in more Bitcoins.\n\nBitcoin Mining Calculator, a Bitcoin Profitability Calculator Calculating the Bitcoin Mining profitability helps evaluate the mining rewards and mining costs. That can be done with the help of a Bitcoin Mining calculator, which requires the user to fill in details, including Bitcoin mining hashrate, consumption of power in Watts, cost of electricity in $/kWh, and maintenance fees. The hashrate values are adjusted, and an appropriate mining hardware device is selected from the ASIC Bitcoin miners list. The Bitcoin profitability calculator uses strategies for providing reliable and accurate profitability information about Bitcoins. This information is crucial for the miners as they make decisions about Bitcoin Mining based on such information. The miners continue the mining process only if a high profit is earned and the cost of electricity consumption is low.\n\nWhat Does It Take to Run a Profitable Bitcoin Mining Venture? Choice of Hardware Bitcoin mining hardware performance is measured in terms of hash rate. Current new-generation ASIC miners produce 100 TH/s (trillion hashes per second) and cost somewhere between $8,000 - $10,000. Ordinary CPUs do not have the capacity to produce such fast hash rates. Location Developed nations may well have an edge when it comes to location because of the low cost of power. Bitcoin is quite power-intensive. It was estimated that one bitcoin transaction requires approximately 1,544 kWh of power to complete, which is equivalent to around 53 days of normal power consumed in an average American household which translates to an average of $200 in cost for a single transaction at 13 cents per kWh. Thus finding the right location with lower electricity costs of less than 10 cents per kWh will help maintain a profitable bitcoin mining venture.\n\nProfit From Bitcoin Mining In essence, earnings from bitcoin mining should be able to recover the cost of the mining requirements purchased as well as the running costs of electricity. This is possible with efficient hardware, lower electricity costs, and joining a reliable mining pool which we shall see below.\n\nRisks and Limitations To hear some people describing Bitcoin mining, you\u2019d think that all you need to do is solve a few puzzles and you\u2019ll be rolling in easy money. But remember, if something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is. Bitcoin has its share of limitations and risks, such as: It can leave security vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit\n\nThere is no guarantee of success; you could wind up investing a huge amount of money in the necessary equipment and have virtually no ROI (Return on Investment).\n\nIt\u2019s responsible for boosting utility and computing costs.\n\nSince Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are volatile, even if you manage to successfully mine a respectable amount of cryptocurrency, you\u2019ll still be underwater if the value suddenly plummets.\n\nCryptocurrency is decentralized, so there are no government regulations. Consequently, there are no legal protections.\n\nBitcoin transactions are irreversible. If you send the wrong amount or give the right amount to the wrong person, well, your options to correct things are limited.\n\nAnd finally, regardless of the huge buzz that cryptocurrencies generate, at the end of the day, it\u2019s not widely accepted.\n\nBitcoin Mining Electricity Cost Calculator The profitability of Bitcoin Mining is a complicated process as numerous factors affect the profitability of Bitcoin Mining. Electricity consumption is one of the major factors affecting profitability. An electricity cost calculator is used for finding the amount of electricity consumption in kWh. The calculator estimates the amount of kW used in the whole day. After this, the kWh cost is estimated based on the user's location energy prices and then multiplied by 30 to find the monthly electricity expense. Based on these results, many miners shifted to locations where electricity prices were not very high.\n\nA Pickaxe Strategy for Bitcoin Mining During the California Gold Rush of 1849, hordes of people descended on the West Coast to search for gold and make their fortune. Naturally, this was a risky proposition, as success wasn\u2019t guaranteed. But do you know what was a can\u2019t miss success? Investing in the companies making the pickaxes that all the prospectors (the failures as well as the successful ones) had to buy. In the context of Bitcoin, this means investing in the manufacturing companies that produce hardware most often used in Bitcoin mining, such as companies that make GPUs or ASIC equipment.\n\nPooling Resources for Bitcoin Mining While miners may decide to go solo, joining a pool offers them immense benefits. Pool mining utilizes joint hardware capacity and allows miners to spread risks and energy costs while at the same time increasing their stakes of discovering a block and earning a block reward. It is also relatively less costly to join a mining pool, given that the capital requirement is spread across several miners. Even though income from mining is shared between miners, hence smaller payouts, it is stable thanks to the higher-earning stakes. The reward for each miner in the mining pool is calculated based on individual share difficulty and share time in the pool. The more powerful miners are typically assigned a higher difficulty and will thus be entitled to a larger proportion of reward compared to the others. The network automatically calculates the share difficulty and share time. However, each miner will be required to submit their share records.

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nGrayscale achieves a partial victory against SEC.\n\nBitcoin spiked to $28,000 after court decision.\n\nChart analysis points out a potential downtrend continuation.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled a reassessment of the SEC\u2019s refusal of Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF application. This development marks a significant turning point in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nHistorically, the SEC has rejected Bitcoin ETF proposals, citing concerns about market manipulation. However, the court emphasized that the SEC\u2019s reasons for denial lacked clear comprehensiveness.\n\nThe court explained that the SEC failed to offer sufficient rationale for approving the listing of two Bitcoin futures ETPs while rejecting Grayscale\u2019s proposed Bitcoin ETP.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price surged over 7% to $28,000 on Tuesday after a U.S. federal appeals court directed the SEC to re-evaluate its denial of Grayscale Investments\u2019 proposal to turn its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF.\n\nWhile Bitcoin settled just above $27,900, GBTC\u2019s value increased by 17%. This court decision hints at the potential for a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., which could enhance accessibility to Bitcoin investments.\n\nAfter the news, crypto stocks like Coinbase and MicroStrategy surged. Major altcoins also rose about 5%. The ruling visibly impacted the market, causing $87 million in shorts to be liquidated in a day, possibly leading to the price spike.\n\nAs Bitcoin previously fell by 14%, can this be a catalyst for an upturn?\n\nOn-chain data\n\nThe positive news definitely impacted the cryptocurrency market and boosted Bitcoin price. But what did actually cause this spike?\n\nLooking at the Bitcoin all exchanges reserves chart, there is evidence of an on-chain accumulation. From August 15, when the price started decreasing, the number of Bitcoins on exchange hasn\u2019t changed a lot. But in the sideways range that followed between August 18 and 28, it started picking up the momentum.\n\nIt went from 2,071,250 to 2,028,169 right before the rise and has now fallen to 2,007,135. This suggests that, before the news, investors had been accumulating Bitcoin in its sideways range and later doubled down after the news came.\n\nThe derivatives market has certainly amplified the increase. Open interest, which represents the number of open positions (long and short), was also on the rise. This metric suggests that traders reacted to the news and were attentive in capturing the uptrend.\n\nThere was a large spike in short liquidations that definitely added to the price rise, as short positions were forced to buy up the coin as their stop losses were reached.\n\nBitcoin Price Analysis\n\nIn our previous Bitcoin analysis, we projected the start of a recovery to exactly $28,000.\n\nThis was expected as a corrective move, either as a lower B wave from the ABC correction to target the $22,000 area for Bitcoin, or as wave 2 from the larger five-wave impulse downward.\n\nIn both cases, we may see a further downside movement for the Bitcoin, according to these counts, as the uptrend completion occurred. $28,000 is a significant horizontal level that served as support and is now being tested for resistance. We saw a large price spike but the overall bearish structure hasn\u2019t been broken.\n\nReviewing the current chart, this projection remains valid, even if the price rises slightly. It would become invalid if it surpasses its previous high of $31,850. This would suggest the earlier assumed completed uptrend has further potential upward movement.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the midst of the recent regulatory developments, markets reacted positively. It is important to note that this isn\u2019t a major victory nor it indicates that the Grayscale Bitcoin Spot ETF is a certainty.\n\nOn the other hand, it just means that the U.S. regulators have taken a fair approach to crypto regulations and haven\u2019t been one-sided on the ETF matter. Bitcoin\u2019s price rose on both fundamentals and technicals sides but can this rise propel the market into a sustainable uptrend?\n\nWe are going to see shortly the outcome as $28,000 may be an area of strong resistance that is going to set up the price into a further downtrend.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

Bitcoin surged more than 5%, trading at US$27,436 by 11:15 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. Meanwhile, STX, the token for the Bitcoin layer-2 solution, Stacks, saw a 14.6% jump to US$0.51.\n\nThis pivotal ruling not only serves as a beacon of optimism for Grayscale but may also chart the course for other financial heavyweights, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, waiting in the wings for the SEC\u2019s decision on their own spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s dispute with the SEC dates back to June 2022, following the commission\u2019s approval of ProShares\u2019 futures-based Bitcoin ETF in October of the previous year. Grayscale aimed to launch its own ETF, uniquely underpinning the fund directly with Bitcoin rather than relying on Bitcoin derivatives.\n\nThe SEC, however, dismissed their application in the subsequent summer, raising alarms over potential market manipulations and the robustness of investor safeguards.\n\nSee related article: Crypto gets a boost following reports of Fidelity\u2019s imminent Bitcoin spot ETF filing"

Circuit\u2019s decision in SEC vs. Grayscale. This victory requires the SEC to review its stance on the spot-based Bitcoin ETF application. As a result, BTC and related tokens such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV), and Stacks (STX) have all gained positively.\n\nBitcoin Cash increased by 19% on Tuesday, August 30, 2023, reaching $228 and making an overall increase of 40% since its August 18 low of $162.\n\nBitcoin Cash originated in 2017 from Bitcoin through a blockchain fork, resulting in the creation of a distinct asset and network based on a copy of Bitcoin\u2019s code.\n\nThis is why it wasn\u2019t deemed as an unregistered security as it was offered to Bitcoin holders at the time of the fork.\n\nIn a resurfaced video from 2018, US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman, Gary Gensler, asserted that Bitcoin Cash \u2013 just like Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin \u2013 are not considered as securities.\n\nChair Gensler in 2018 at a Bloomberg conference in NYC: \u201cBitcoin.

Deep fake? pic.twitter.com/p7DJlYkJIt \u2014 Ryan Selkis \ud83e\udeb3 (@twobitidiot) June 12, 2023\n\nThis video posted in mid-June had an explosive price rise of Bitcoin Cash followed. From June, 10 when the price was sitting at $100, a 227% increase to $328 happened on July 1, propelled by the the Wall Street-approved EDX exchange listing on 20 June.\n\nThis definitely proves that Bitcoin\u2019s regulatory sentiment impacts its forks and related projects and Bitcoin Cash has been paving the way.\n\nBCH Price Analysis\n\nIn our previous BCH analysis on July 27, we projected another lower low before the price enters a bullish period. This lower low was expected to be at around $221.\n\n\u201cOn one hand, the price could potentially drop to around $221 before recovering to somewhere in the region of $360.\u201d\n\nThe price initially dropped to $221 on August 3 and then climbed to $246. But it lacked the momentum to sustain the upward movement and faced rejection at the descending trendline. This seems to be a continuation of corrective wave 4, with the price now aiming for a new high above $331.\n\nBased on this analysis, starting from November 10, 2022, a five-wave upswing began. The drop to $162 on August 18 finished wave 4. If this holds and the price rises again, it could validate our initial bull cycle hypothesis. Alternatively, the jump to $331 on June 30 ended the ABC correction, wave X from the highest count. This implies the descent from August begins the broader wave Z, potentially taking the price to the $90 support zone.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter Bitcoin\u2019s positive surge, Bitcoin Cash has also rebounded strongly. Despite a slightly deeper expected low in line with our prior analysis, our bullish perspective remains intact. Nevertheless, a downturn below the $180 initial point of this uptrend might suggest a corrective increase, signaling the beginning of a broader downtrend.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

Amazon\u2019s stance on accepting cryptocurrency remains unclear at this time.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t spend Bitcoin or other cryptos on Amazon through other means!\n\nWith crypto cards and gift cards on the rise, there are a number of ways to use bitcoins on Amazon without spending it directly on the store.\n\nHow to Use Bitcoin on Amazon?\n\nThere are many ways to spend Bitcoin, even if a vendor doesn\u2019t have direct Bitcoin transaction capabilities on their site or in their brick-and-mortar store.\n\nThere are 2 ways to use Bitcoin on Amazon.\n\nUse Crypto Card to pay with crypto on Amazon\n\nBuy Amazon gift cards with cryptocurrency\n\nUse Crypto Card to Pay with Crypto on Amazon\n\nThis option is the best way to use Bitcoin on Amazon. Simply sign up for a crypto card, top it up, and spend Bitcoin or other cryptos on Amazon.\n\nA crypto card is like a regular bank or payment card, but one that allows crypto payments. Most crypto cards support 5 \u2013 10 cryptos and may require manual conversion of crypto to fiat before allowing a purchase, a process that can be slow and expensive.\n\nHowever, the CryptoWallet.com crypto card has the lowest fees and most supported cryptos in the world, plus direct spending! Check out our whitelist for more info.\n\nBuy Amazon Gift Cards with Cryptocurrency\n\nThere\u2019s another option when it comes to Amazon accepting crypto \u2013 gift cards!\n\nAmazon gift cards are like vouchers that are only accepted on Amazon. You can buy them from many locations and redeem them online for Amazon products just like you would spend cash at a store.\n\nThink of an Amazon gift card like a prepaid bank card \u2013 it has a balance, listed in fiat, which you can spend on anything you like on Amazon.\n\nYou can easily buy gift cards with Bitcoin on sites like Coinsbee or CryptoRefills. Read our section further down in this article for more details on how to complete this process.\n\nWill Amazon Ever Accept Bitcoin?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say whether Amazon will accept Bitcoin in the future. The last official statement on the matter was in 2014, when Amazon stated that it would not be accepting Bitcoin payments, but much has changed since then.\n\nWith major companies like PayPal, AT&T, and American Express embracing Bitcoin, it\u2019s possible that Amazon will eventually come around as well.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another point to consider. There are indications that Amazon may launch its own digital currency, with a beta project already being rolled out in Mexico. If Amazon intends to launch a major digital currency through its platform, the company may not wish to lend credence or support to existing competitors like Bitcoin.\n\nCrypto Card: Spend Bitcoin and 800+ Cryptos on Amazon\n\nThe CryptoWallet.com crypto card allows direct spending of crypto, meaning you can simply make a transaction and the card will instantly update your wallet balance. The card works with on-platform or third-party wallets, it supports over 800 cryptos, and it has the lowest fees out of any crypto card in the world.\n\nSign up for our crypto card here.\n\nAmazon Crypto Payments FAQs"

        "title": "Pantera Capital Shares Bitcoin Halving Insights -- BTC to $35K Then onto $148K - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nHedge fund Pantera Capital predicts Bitcoin to reach $35k then $148k\n\nBitcoin follows patterns predicted by creator Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nPantera believes Bitcoin halving events matter less over time\n\nSince its genesis, Bitcoin\u2019s future has been designed according to a strict mathematical equation. The founder of Bitcoin and blockchains, Satoshi Nakamoto, designed Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain to run itself according to rules that govern the ceiling of Bitcoin tokens issued, as well as planned halving events that would see miners earning fewer tokens over time, creating scarcity of the token.\n\nPantera Capital, a crypto hedge fund, has been keeping tabs on Bitcoin halving events taking place on the chain. The company now predicts Bitcoin to reach $35,000 by its next planned halving event in 2024, and $148,000 after the event.\n\nPantera\u2019s Predictions\n\nThe hedge fund managing assets worth over $4.2 billion noticed a key pattern in Bitcoin\u2019s progression, closely tying its price changes to upcoming halving events.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has historically bottomed 477 days prior to the halving, climbed leading into it, and then exploded to the upside afterwards. The post-halving rallies have averaged 480 days \u2013 from the halving to the peak of that next bull cycle.\u201d\n\nPantera\u2019s prediction model expected Bitcoin to drop in price in December 2022. In actuality, Bitcoin troughed in November 2022, after the events of FTX\u2019s collapse.\n\nAccordingly, Pantera expects Bitcoin to rally twice in 2024, once at the start of the year, and another time after the halving event set in the same year.\n\nMoreover, although Bitcoin has recently experienced a sharp drop in price, Pantera reports that Bitcoin is actually outperforming forecasts by 7%, expecting the token to reach $35,000 by next year\u2019s halving event.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more interesting is that the company expects Bitcoin to reach $148,000 in value after the 2024 halving event.\n\n\u201cThe 2020 halving reduced the supply of new bitcoins by 43% relative to the previous halving. It had a 23% as big an impact on price.\n\nThe next halving is expected to occur on April 20, 2024. Since most bitcoins are now in circulation, each halving will be almost exactly half as big a reduction in new supply. If history were to repeat itself, the next halving would see bitcoin rising to $35k before the halving and $148k after.\u201d\n\nSatoshi\u2019s Plan For Bitcoin\n\n\u201cAnnouncing the first release of Bitcoin, a new electronic cash system that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending. It\u2019s completely decentralized with no server or central authority,\u201d reads the introduction of Nakamoto\u2019s paper, titled Bitcoin v0.1 released .\n\n\u201cThe software is still alpha and experimental. There\u2019s no guarantee the system\u2019s state won\u2019t have to be restarted at some point if it becomes necessary, although I\u2019ve done everything I can to build in extensibility and versioning.\u201d\n\nSatoshi\u2019s paper goes on to explain how Bitcoin trading and mining works, citing \u201cI made the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to generate coins in just a few hours. It\u2019ll get a lot harder when competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty.\u201d\n\nHowever, among the keynotes Nakamoto included in his paper are ones regarding the token\u2019s total circulation limit and details on future halving events on the chain.\n\n\u201cTotal circulation will be 21,000,000 coins. It\u2019ll be distributed to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half every 4 years.\n\nfirst 4 years: 10,500,000 coins\n\nnext 4 years: 5,250,000 coins\n\nnext 4 years: 2,625,000 coins\n\nnext 4 years: 1,312,500 coins\n\netc\u2026\n\nWhen that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if needed. It\u2019s based on open market competition, and there will probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.\u201d\n\nHalving events are a common occurrence among cryptocurrencies (such as Litecoin) as the process allows for tokens to scale in value by creating intentional scarcity. Think of other valuable commodities, such as gold. The more scarce gold gets, the lower the supply, and the higher the demand for it, hence increasing its value by default."

        "title": "No, Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges are not inherently bullish for crypto - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Crypto analysts on X (the social media platform formerly known as Twitter) and in YouTube interviews have been abuzz with talk about the trend of Bitcoin leaving centralized exchanges.\n\nOn Aug. 29, the quantity of Bitcoin (BTC) held within exchanges saw a decline, reaching its lowest point since January 2018. While various factors might underlie this movement, experts analyzing blockchain data often interpret the shift as a positive indicator. Traders are now questioning what might have been causing Bitcoin\u2019s inability to break above $31,000 since this price action doesn\u2019t align with their view that fewer coins on exchanges is bullish for the BTC price.\n\nThe perspective on the decline of Bitcoin held at centralized exchanges stems from the notion that when traders withdraw their coins, it signals a bullish sentiment. This is typically associated with a strategy of holding assets in self-custody for the long haul.\n\nAlthough these suppositions lack conclusive evidence, their persistence likely stems from historical precedent. However, establishing a relationship between these events and a specific cause remains elusive, regardless of the frequency of such occurrences. While buying on exchanges might necessitate depositing fiat currency beforehand, the reverse is not necessarily true.\n\nData fails to show correlation between on-chain metrics and Bitcoin price action\n\nData from blockchain transactions displays a consistent reduction in Bitcoin deposits on exchanges since mid-May. Concurrently, Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory fails to offer substantial indications of a bullish upswing, with the exception of a brief surge in mid-June that coincided with BlackRock's submission of an application for a spot exchange-traded fund.\n\nBitcoin aggregate exchange net position change, in BTC. Source: Glassnode\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the period encompassing a 30% surge from March 12 to March 19 witnessed an increase in deposits on exchanges, contrasting the predictions of on-chain analysis. Despite this contradiction, instances of influencers addressing the weaknesses in these enduring myths are scarce. This could be attributed to the simplicity of linking deposits on exchanges to an augmented inclination for selling.\n\nCertainly, all indicators are prone to occasional inaccuracies, and depending solely on on-chain analysis to dictate market trends is unwise. Yet, the notion that withdrawals from exchanges are predominantly earmarked for transfer to cold storage lacks substantial grounding and exists largely as a hypothetical proposition. For example, there are three possible reasons that explain reduced deposits on exchanges unrelated to a diminished short-term selling intent.\n\nBitcoin holders shifted to a reliable custody solution\n\nThe foremost explanation for Bitcoin withdrawals from exchanges not necessarily indicating a decrease in short-term selling pressure is the burgeoning trust in custody solutions. This implies that these coins might have been acquired in the past, and only recently has the owner felt at ease moving them. Notably, reputable custodians like Prime Trust took investors by surprise when it sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware due to a shortage in customer funds. Additionally, a staggering sum of approximately $35 million in crypto assets was pilfered from Atomic Wallet users in June. The prevailing lack of trust in custody solutions could elucidate the cautious approach investors adopted before initiating withdrawals from exchanges.\n\nInvestors have lost confidence in centralized exchanges\n\nOn June 5, the Securities and Exchange Commission launched a legal suit against Binance, alleging the offering of unregistered securities. Just a day following the Binance lawsuit, the commission turned its focus to Coinbase on analogous grounds, contending that prominent altcoins provided by the exchange meet the criteria for securities. Further compounding matters, an Aug. 2 report from Semafor disclosed that United States Justice Department officials expressed apprehensions about a Binance indictment triggering a run on the exchange, akin to the events surrounding FTX in November 2022. These regulatory actions may have influenced users\u2019 decisions to keep their deposited coins away from exchanges, irrespective of their selling intentions, thus rendering the withdrawals unrelated to price fluctuations.\n\nDecreasing interest from buyers could balance out the trend\n\nEven if one postulates that the majority of the Bitcoin departing from exchanges is indeed headed to cold wallets, implying holders have a reduced propensity to engage in short-term selling, the demand facet of the equation has encountered its own set of challenges. For instance, a search for \u201cbuy Bitcoin\u201d on Google Trends has struggled to surpass 50% of its previous two-year peak.\n\nGoogle Trend searches for \u201cbuy Bitcoin\u201d worldwide. Source: Google\n\nSimilarly, Bitcoin\u2019s spot trading volume has averaged a modest $7 billion per day in August, representing less than half the trading activity observed between January and March.\n\nBitcoin adjusted daily volume, USD. Source: Messari and Kaiko\n\nAs a result, the data underscores a waning interest from buyers, which in turn mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s lack of bullish momentum. This parallel trend aligns with the decrease in the number of coins being deposited on exchanges. Consequently, despite Bitcoin\u2019s exchange deposits plummeting to levels last seen in 2018, the effect on the supply-demand equilibrium is negligible, owing to the subdued trading activity that has prevailed.\n\nUltimately, while on-chain metric analysis might provide foundational support for the notion of coins transitioning to the possession of long-term holders, this viewpoint offers scant backing in terms of price dynamics, as the movement may reflect a broader reluctance to actively trade the asset.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "As appeals court rules in favor of Grayscale, a bitcoin spot ETF could be on the horizon - TechCrunch",
        "content": "As appeals court rules in favor of Grayscale, a bitcoin spot ETF could be on the horizon The court ruled that the SEC\u2019s denial of a bitcoin ETF was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled in favor of Grayscale, a digital asset management firm, in a lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the matter of a bitcoin ETF, according to a legal filing on Tuesday.\n\nThis ruling is in response to Grayscale\u2019s lawsuit against the SEC, which denied the firm\u2019s application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange traded fund (ETF) on June 29, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products,\u201d the filing stated. \u201cWe therefore grant Grayscale\u2019s petition and vacate the order.\u201d\n\nThe court ruled 3-0 in favor of Grayscale, which currently owns 3.4% of outstanding bitcoin, \u201cworth tens of billions of dollars,\u201d according to the filing.\n\nTo many in the crypto space, the ruling represents a huge victory. The news was so welcome that within minutes of the courts\u2019 ruling on Tuesday, Bitcoin\u2019s price rose over 7% to nearly $28,000.\n\n\u201cThis judicial decision is a monumental step for the whole cryptocurrency sector, including Grayscale,\u201d Yusuf Sevim, CEO of blockchain tech-focused Metatime, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt gives a legal and financial stamp of approval, encouraging more traditional investors to venture into the space.\u201d It also set an \u201cencouraging example\u201d that could affect financial markets beyond the United States, Sevim said.\n\nThat\u2019s not hyperbole. A company being able to offer a bitcoin spot ETF could allow folks in the traditional financial world to buy into the crypto market using their existing investing services \u2014 companies like Fidelity and Vanguard that may hold retirement assets, for example.\n\nBringing bitcoin to the TradFi market in a manner that is already well-understood from an operational, trading and fee perspective has the potential to unlock lots of demand for the cryptocurrency in the near-term. Such interest could lead to the ETF in question buying more total bitcoin to meet demand, shifting crypto\u2019s supply equation. More demand with flat supply would send the price up, in other words.\n\nWhen Grayscale\u2019s application was denied a little more than a year ago, Michael Sonnenshein, the company\u2019s CEO, stated that he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d and \u201cvehemently disagree[d]\u201d with the SEC\u2019s decision.\n\nToday, Sonnenshein is singing a different tune.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 JUST IN \ud83d\udea8 The D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of @Grayscale in our lawsuit challenging the SEC's decision to deny $GBTC's conversion to an ETF! Thank you to everyone who has been on this journey with us, especially our investors. We are grateful for your support and\u2026 \u2014 Sonnenshein (@Sonnenshein) August 29, 2023\n\n\u201cThis is a monumental step forward for American investors, the Bitcoin ecosystem, and all those who have been advocating for Bitcoin exposure through the added protections of the ETF wrapper,\u201d said Jennifer Rosenthal, a spokeswoman for Grayscale.\n\nSending a message\n\nThis is the latest blow in a series of \u201closses\u201d for the SEC. Last month, a federal court ruled partially in favor of Ripple Labs and its XRP token, stating that the cryptocurrency is not a security when it comes to public sales but could be considered one in some cases for institutional sales. The SEC is appealing the decision.\n\n\u201cWe have now seen a second big digital asset decision go against the SEC,\u201d said Jeffrey Blockinger, chief legal counsel at decentralized exchange Vertex Protocol. \u201cTo me, the court system is sending a message that the SEC needs to more carefully understand the limits on its authority and work within those limits.\u201d\n\nThis ruling sends a \u201cclear message\u201d from the court that bitcoin spot ETFs are not inherently riskier than other investment products and that the SEC cannot arbitrarily deny their approval, said Steve Rosenblum, CEO and co-founder of crypto risk management platform Libertify.\n\nThis move could also open the doors to both individual and institutional investors who were taking a cautious approach to the crypto market, or bitcoin specifically, and have been waiting for regulations to be established. \u201cU.S. courts are legitimizing digital assets through litigation,\u201d Blockinger said.\n\nThe court not siding with the SEC also indicates that it may have to consider a more collaborative approach rather than attempting to impose constraints on the crypto world, Sevim said. \u201cThis is a watershed moment indicating that the cryptocurrency arena is maturing to a stage where it can\u2019t be easily controlled or sidelined.\u201d\n\nBlockinger added that he doesn\u2019t expect Congress to give the SEC authority over the industry. \u201cIt looks like the SEC\u2019s aspirations to control the industry in the near term are diminishing.\u201d\n\nThe future of bitcoin spot ETFs\n\nThe ruling has wider repercussions for the entire crypto industry, Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of Nexo, said. However, he also pointed out that this is just one of the steps needed to unfold favorably for Grayscale\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF to stand a chance of being launched.\n\nAs it stands, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC shares trade at an up to 30% discount to the value of its underlying coins, which, the firm estimates, leaves over $4 billion on the table.\n\nThis new ruling may also pave the way for other companies that want to launch bitcoin spot ETFs, alongside others like BlackRock, Fidelity, Schwab and WisdomTree.\n\n\u201cAssuming the SEC does not appeal, it is likely to result in quick approval of not only Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application, but many of the other nine applications pending before the SEC as well,\u201d said Ric Edelman, founder of Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals. This verdict \u201csignificantly increases\u201d the likelihood that the SEC will approve one or more spot bitcoin ETF applications soon, he added.\n\nTrenchev added that the ruling is \u201cundoubtedly bullish\u201d for the possibility of a bitcoin spot ETF and it has expedited the potential for approval.\n\n\u201cThe development is game-changing,\u201d Sevim said. \u201cUntil now, cautious investors had limited options, but a spot Bitcoin ETF makes cryptocurrency investment more accessible and legitimizes it further.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, many crypto players are optimistic.\n\n\u201cThe SEC remains the most dominant and pugilistic of all the U.S. financial regulators,\u201d Trenchev said. \u201cWhat has changed, however, is that crypto companies, including exchanges, funds and token projects, are willing to stand up to have their argument heard. Whether a more collaborative and inclusive regulatory approach will be adopted, only time will tell.\u201d\n\nOn another note, bankers, investment advisors and other financial professionals are likely to feel more comfortable recommending bitcoin ETFs to their clients, Rosenblum said.\n\n\u201cThe horizon looks brighter than ever,\u201d Sevim said. \u201cThis legal victory may well act as the first domino, triggering a series of regulatory relaxations and opening the floodgates for other financial products centered on cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nWhether or not it will actually create a positive domino effect is anybody\u2019s guess at this time. But investors who were cautious about the space prior to this ruling may view this moment as a big green light to hit the gas pedal and drive into crypto land."

The current discount of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to its NAV is about 24%, according to data from YCharts.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust soared more than 17% on Tuesday.

        "content": "Yesterday's highly awaited decision from a federal appeals court appears to have paved the way for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to finally be launched. This news sent Bitcoin (BTC -0.26%) rocketing higher yesterday, with the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization briefly breaching the $28,000 level. Today, cooler heads and some apparent profit-taking have led Bitcoin to settle around the $27,200 level as of this writing.\n\nA three-judge U.S. Court of Appeals panel in Washington effectively overturned the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) decision to halt the development of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund by crypto asset manager Grayscale. The SEC views futures-based ETFs (which are currently allowed) as safer for investors. The SEC has suggested it will review the decision, but all eyes are now turning to which companies will be in line to launch a spot ETF first.\n\nWhy this ruling matters\n\nGrayscale's proposal appears to be one that should have been approved, at least according to Judge Naomi Rao, who inserted some interesting comments in the court's opinion on this matter. The judge suggested that the \"denial of Grayscale's proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products.\" In essence, the court failed to see how a spot Bitcoin ETF would be substantially different from a futures-based ETF (which are currently allowed), given the close correlation of the underlying assets of both products.\n\nThe panel appears to be calling into question the SEC's logic with how it has regulated crypto-related products thus far. While crypto proponents have long called for such common sense questioning of the status quo, this latest case of a court siding with the crypto sector certainly has many investors taking a bullish stance on this alternative asset class. This win is the latest feather in the cap of crypto enthusiasts, who previously saw XRP (XRP -0.15%) win a key ruling in its legal fight against the SEC over whether cryptocurrencies constitute securities.\n\nWho will win the race to list the first spot Bitcoin ETF?\n\nIt's not entirely clear if Grayscale will be the first to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF, even though this victory is tied to the company's legal fight against the SEC. Other high-profile spot Bitcoin ETF applications remain on the SEC's proverbial desk, meaning this precedent-setting victory for Grayscale could lead to an influx of ETFs in a short amount of time.\n\nIf the floodgates open, as many as 10 other spot Bitcoin ETF applications from the likes of BlackRock, Invesco, VanEck and other major asset managers could be approved in short order. Many of these applications have approaching deadlines, which could lead to a flurry of activity in this sector.\n\nSome experts believe that the market for spot Bitcoin ETFs could amount to as much as $150 billion, about the same amount of capital currently floating around in precious metals ETFs. That's plenty of potential capital to be spread across 10 or more spot ETFs, and it could lead to increased competition in this niche, which could potentially result in a race to the bottom in terms of fees for fund managers.\n\nWhat now?\n\nA regulated and competitive spot Bitcoin ETF market only serves to improve liquidity in the Bitcoin and crypto market overall, as well as lower the barriers to entry for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with this alternative asset class. In theory, competitive fee structures and publicly traded ETF options should lead to greater institutional investor adoption, which should prompt more stability in this otherwise volatile asset class.\n\nFor long-term investors who have already diversified into crypto, this court ruling provides the kind of validation many expected to see in years past. As the saying goes, it's better late than never, and with the SEC clearly running into legal roadblocks in its effort to constrain the crypto market, this latest ruling should spur investor interest in this asset class for some time to come."

        "title": "Chinese gov't fires up the printer \u2014 How will it impact Bitcoin price? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "News headlines have recently covered how China\u2019s struggling economy poses significant risk to global growth. Economic activity and the flow of credit in the region are weakening, and analysts are not convinced that the Chinese government\u2019s interventions are a sufficient fix for what appear to be structural problems.\n\nFor instance, industrial output in July increased by 3.7% compared to the previous year, which is slower than June\u2019s growth rate of 4.4%. Furthermore, Chinese banks issued 89% fewer new loans in July versus June, the lowest since late 2009.\n\nBeyond its impact on global economic growth, there\u2019s concern among investors that the turmoil in China\u2019s real estate market might trigger a ripple effect on the U.S. dollar and commodities. This, in turn, could create an unfavorable scenario for Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nOn Aug. 28, the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index, a key indicator of the Chinese stock market, initially surged by 5.5% before ultimately closing the day with a 1.2% gain. Despite this improvement, Chinese shares continue to be among the poorest performers globally in equity indexes tracked by Bloomberg.\n\nBitcoin traders have valid concerns about potential repercussions from the Chinese stock market\u2019s fluctuations. This unease arises from historical price trends and a broader shift in investor sentiment toward avoiding risk-on markets during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin/USD index (purple, left) vs. China CSI 300 Index (blue, right). Source: TradingView\n\nAs shown in the chart above, Bitcoin's price performance tends to align with the overall movement of China\u2019s stock market, although these movements can be predicted or happen with a time lag. In fact, the 30-day correlation between the CSI 300 Index and Bitcoin/USD reached an unusually high 70% level on Aug. 28.\n\nCan China instill confidence in investors?\n\nInterestingly, the recent surge in the stock market appears to be primarily driven by China\u2019s measures announced on Aug. 27. According to Bloomberg, these measures reportedly included:\n\nSpecial refinancing terms to the real estate sector, which should assist the companies in managing challenges and sustaining economic stability.\n\nReduced fees that encourage companies to buy back shares, potentially boosting stock prices and investor confidence.\n\nSelected trading firms lowering leverage margins, making trading with borrowed funds more accessible to investors.\n\nNew stock offerings are expected to face heightened regulatory scrutiny, reducing the competition for the existing companies.\n\nLimits on selling below the initial public offering price for a specific period to prevent excessive volatility and protect investors from immediate losses.\n\nHowever, it quickly became evident that the measures, which were initially touted as economic stimulus, lacked the intended effect, according to Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura Holdings. He noted that these measures \u201cfall short in halting the downward trend and their impact will be short-lived unless accompanied by support for the actual economy.\"\n\nIn addition to the CSI 300 Index's substantial 23.8% decline since July, there are clear signs of foreign capital fleeing Chinese stocks. Global funds sold around $1.1 billion worth of shares on Aug. 28 alone, contributing to August\u2019s outflows exceeding $11 billion, potentially reaching a record level, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThe crucial question revolves around why China isn\u2019t implementing effective economic stimulus packages. The answer may lie in the country\u2019s currency value. The yuan\u2019s value against the U.S. dollar has been consistently dropping, as depicted by the yuan price chart. This trend is concerning, as it indicates the currency reaching historically low levels.\n\nChinese yuan vs. U.S. dollar. Source: TradingView\n\nDespite incentives like tax breaks, government bond buybacks and monetary distributions to the population, which can lead to increased money circulation and mounting debt, there\u2019s a negative impact on the purchasing power of the yuan. The situation is complex and lacks an easy solution, possibly resulting in China experiencing significantly slower economic growth.\n\nA strong U.S. dollar is bad news for Bitcoin\u2019s price\n\nInterestingly, the primary beneficiary of the outflow from the Chinese stock market seems to be the stock market in the United States, ultimately strengthening the U.S. dollar. As capital flows away from Chinese equities, it tends to weaken the local currency, as investors seek lower-risk options like the S&P 500 index or U.S. money market funds.\n\nUnfortunately, this scenario could present a challenge for Bitcoin, considering it\u2019s priced in dollars and competes as an alternative store of value. For those anticipating a cryptocurrency rally due to a global economic downturn, it\u2019s important to note that the U.S. dollar doesn\u2019t need to be flawless; it only needs to outperform other competing fiat currencies.\n\nStill, market dynamics can swiftly transform once investors recognize the potential overvaluation of the U.S. stock market or when indications of a looming moderate recession in the U.S. emerge, irrespective of the relative strength of the U.S. dollar against its counterparts. Consequently, the value of Bitcoin as an independent and alternative hedge remains valid regardless of being presently unable to reclaim the $29,000 support.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The stock tied to the crypto space seeing a boost in today's trading session, closing at nearly 15% now, the move to the upside coming after a federal appeals court delivering a favorable ruling related to a spot Bitcoin ETF, and this all ties back to Grayscale and the ruling, their ruling against the SEC I should say, in favor of Grayscale.\n\nNow, the excitement in Coinbase, there's been some conflicting, I guess, opinions out there in the street, because Dan Dolev over at Mizuho was actually out with a note saying that he doesn't think this is going to really materially benefit Coinbase. But, Akiko, we're seeing the excitement in Coinbase, the excitement in Bitcoin today, and we have seen, certainly, a number of asset managers wanting to get into that spot Bitcoin ETF space.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, Dan Dolev over at Mizuho saying that just because the platform offers crypto doesn't necessarily mean it's positive, because it could actually increase competition and really put pressure on retail take rates for Coinbase specifically. He's already got an underperform rating on the stock. But worth noting, by the way, it wasn't just Bitcoin and Ethereum of the main crypto assets that we follow closely that rallied today. We also saw some of those Bitcoin mining plays also seeing a big bump on the back of this, Ride and Marathon Digital Holdings rallying in the session as well."

        "content": "Today the Court of Appeals ruled that the SEC was wrong to block the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust from converting to an exchange traded fund (ETF). That\u2019s because the SEC had already allowed ETFs based on Bitcoin futures and the prices correlate 99.9% of the time.\n\nHowever, the ruling is not binding for the next seven days which leaves time for the SEC to ask for the case to be reheard. Three Appellate judges made up the deciding panel, but the SEC could request the case be heard before all the judges.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust has been notorious for its discount to market prices, hence the desire to convert to an exchange traded fund (ETF) which will be more liquid as it\u2019s not limited to accredited investors. The trust price reached almost a 50% discount in January and improved to 44% below spot prices in mid-June when BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin ETF. Since then the discount has declined to around 25%.\n\n\u201cIt is a fundamental principle of administrative law that agencies must treat like cases alike,\u201d said Circuit Judge Rao. \u201cThe denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products.\u201d\n\nFutures-based products are traded on the CME, which is a regulated exchange, unlike spot cryptocurrency exchanges. However, the price correlation between the futures and spot markets was seen as undermining that rationale because futures prices are based on spot markets. If the spot markets are being manipulated, then that will impact the futures market as well.\n\nThe court concluded that the SEC failed to provide a \u201creasonable and coherent explanation\u201d for treating similar products inconsistently.\n\nMeanwhile, there is a queue of spot Bitcoin ETFs awaiting approval by the SEC. The key attraction is that ETFs are an accessible surrogate for owning Bitcoin directly without the hassle of custody. Apart from the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust, the SEC is reviewing refiled applications from ARK 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, Wisdomtree, Investco Galaxy, Wise Origin and Valkyrie.\n\nThe Bitcoin price jumped from just shy of $26,000 to above $27,500."

Previously, the SEC rejected its GBTC application on grounds that the products were not \u201cdesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\u201d Grayscale subsequently sued, and the decision has been overturned.\n\nAccording to Aug. 29 court filings, U.S. Court of Appeals Circuit Judge Neomi Rao ordered Grayscale\u2019s petition for review be granted and the SEC\u2019s order to deny the GBTC listing application be vacated. Previously, Judge Rao said that the SEC did not \u201coffer any explanation\u201d as to why Grayscale was in the wrong. However, the order does not guarantee the eventual listing of a Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nMichael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale, said on X (formerly Twitter) that its legal team is \u201cactively reviewing\u201d the court opinion.\n\nJUST IN\n\n\n\nThe D.C.

Earlier this year, shares of GBTC traded at a discount of nearly 50% to the net asset value due to the firm\u2019s then ongoing litigation with the SEC and credit concerns regarding its parent, Digital Currency Group (DCG).\n\nIn October 2022, Grayscale terminated material agreements with its partner and digital currency broker Genesis Global. On Nov. 16, 2022, Genesis Global paused withdrawals, citing unprecedented market turmoil amid the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The firm was also impacted by the collapse of Singaporean crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, with a $1.2 billion debt owed to Genesis still unpaid.\n\nIn January 2023, it was disclosed that DCG owes creditors over $3 billion and is considering a $500 million venture capital portfolio sale.
