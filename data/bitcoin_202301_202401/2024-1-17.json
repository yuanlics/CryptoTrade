        "title": "How a 27-Year-Old Codebreaker Busted the Myth of Bitcoin's Anonymity - WIRED",
        "content": "When Meiklejohn started college at Brown in 2004, she discovered cryptography. This branch of computer science appealed directly to her puzzle addiction\u2014what was an encryption system, after all, but another secret language demanding to be deciphered?\n\nThere was a maxim in cryptography, often referred to as Schneier\u2019s law after the cryptographer Bruce Schneier. It asserted that anyone can develop an encryption system clever enough that they can\u2019t themselves think of a way to break it. Yet, like all the best conundrums and mysteries that had fascinated Meiklejohn since childhood, another person with a different way of approaching a cipher could look at that \u201cunbreakable\u201d system and see a way to crack it and unspool a whole world of decrypted revelations.\n\nStudying the science of ciphers, Meiklejohn began to recognize the importance of privacy and the need for surveillance-resistant communications. She was not quite a cypherpunk: The intellectual appeal of building and breaking codes drove her more than any ideological drive to defeat surveillance. But like many cryptographers, she nonetheless came to believe in the need for truly unbreakable encryption, technologies that could carve out a space for sensitive communications\u2014whether dissidents organizing against a repressive government or whistleblowers sharing secrets with journalists\u2014where no snoop could reach. She credited her intuitive acceptance of that principle to her years as a teenager who kept to herself, trying to maintain her own privacy in a Manhattan apartment, with a federal prosecutor for a mother.\n\nMeiklejohn showed real talent as a cryptographer and soon became an undergraduate teaching assistant to Anna Lysyanskaya, a brilliant and highly accomplished computer scientist. Lysyanskaya had herself studied under the legendary Ron Rivest, whose name was represented by the R in the RSA algorithm that formed the basis for most modern encryption, used everywhere from web browsers to encrypted email to instant messaging protocols. RSA was one of the few fundamental encryption protocols that had not succumbed to Schneier\u2019s law in more than 30 years.\n\nLysyanskaya was at the time working on a pre-Bitcoin cryptocurrency called eCash, first developed in the 1990s by David Chaum, a cryptographer whose groundbreaking work on anonymity systems had made possible technologies from VPNs to Tor. After finishing her undergraduate degree, Meiklejohn began a master\u2019s degree at Brown under Lysyanskaya\u2019s wing, researching methods to make Chaum\u2019s eCash, a truly anonymous payment system, more scalable and efficient.\n\nThe cryptocurrency scheme they were laboring to optimize was, Meiklejohn admits in hindsight, difficult to imagine working in practice. Unlike Bitcoin, it had a serious problem: An anonymous spender of eCash could essentially forge a coin and pass it off to an unsuspecting recipient. When that recipient deposited the coin at a kind of eCash bank, the bank could perform a check that would reveal the coin to be a forgery and the fraudster\u2019s anonymity protections could be stripped away to reveal the identity of the bad actor. But by then, the fraudster might have already run off with their ill-gotten goods.\n\nStill, eCash had a unique advantage that made it a fascinating system to work on: The anonymity it offered was truly uncrackable. In fact, eCash was based on a mathematical technique called zero-knowledge proofs, which could establish the validity of a payment without the bank or recipient learning anything else at all about the spender or their money. That mathematical sleight of hand meant that eCash was provably secure. Schneier\u2019s law did not apply: No amount of cleverness or computing power would ever be able to undo its anonymity.\n\n\u201cYou could never prove anything about the privacy properties of this system,\u201d Meiklejohn remembers thinking. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get privacy, what do you get?\u201d\n\nWhen Meiklejohn first heard about Bitcoin in 2011, she had started her PhD studies at UCSD but was spending the summer as a researcher at Microsoft. A friend at the University of Washington had mentioned to her that there was a new digital payment system that people were using to buy drugs on sites like the Silk Road. Meiklejohn had moved on from her eCash studies by then; she was busy with other research\u2014systems that would allow people to pay road tolls without revealing their personal movements, for instance, and a thermal camera technique that revealed PIN codes typed into an ATM by looking for heat remnants on the keypad. So, with heads-down focus, she filed Bitcoin\u2019s existence away in her brain, barely considering it again for the next year.\n\nThen, one day on a UCSD computer science department group hike in late 2012, a young UCSD research scientist named Kirill Levchenko suggested to Meiklejohn that perhaps they should start looking into this burgeoning Bitcoin phenomenon. Levchenko was fascinated, he explained as they trekked around the jagged landscape of the Anza Borrego Desert State Park, by Bitcoin\u2019s unique proof-of-work system. That system demanded that anyone who wanted to mine the currency expend enormous computing resources performing calculations\u2014 essentially a vast, automated puzzle-solving competition\u2014whose results were then copied into transactions on the blockchain. By then, ambitious bitcoiners were already developing custom mining microprocessors just for generating this strange new form of money, and Bitcoin\u2019s ingenious system meant that any single bad actor who might want to write a false transaction into the blockchain would have to use a collection of computers that possessed more computational power than all those many thousands of miners. It was a brilliant approach that added up to a secure currency with no central authority."

With two of the wealthiest and most admired figures in the industry likely on their way to prison for crimes related to the basic operation of their respective company, the notion that any sane person would still choose the crypto roller coaster over the conventional financial system seemed close to unimaginable.\n\n\u201cIs this the end game for crypto?\u201d the New York Times\u2019 Paul Krugman asked in a column in November, predicting the currency was \u201cheaded for oblivion.\u201d"

Earlier, it fell as far down as $40,601.37, its lowest level since Dec. 18. Ether , which has gotten a boost in recent days while bitcoin struggled, fell too. It was last down 3% at $2,448.41. The rest of the crypto market broadly dragged with them.\n\nThe move in bitcoin weighed on crypto-related stocks, too. Coinbase and MicroStrategy ended the trading day down 7% and 2%, respectively.

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved applications from large investment firms to offer spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Retail investors can now buy bitcoin ETFs on traditional exchanges instead of crypto-specific exchanges or trading in even more volatile crypto futures. The SEC\u2019s approval comes as a reversal, due in large part to a recent court ruling, from its prior denial of these applications.\n\nMany of the big institutional investment firms that frequently see their products offered in 401(k) plans, like Fidelity and Blackrock, have created bitcoin ETFs, which will make it easier for investment fiduciaries to add these ETFs as an option in workplace retirement plans.\n\nBut should they?\n\nIn guidance from March of 2022, the U.S Department of Labor (DOL) said it has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about crypto in employer-sponsored retirement plans, and investment fiduciaries should exercise \u201cextreme care.\u201d\n\nChoosing investment options to offer in a 401(k) plan is a fiduciary function \u2014 even if participants make their own choices from those options. In choosing the investment options, fiduciaries must adhere to duties of prudence and loyalty \u2014 the \u201chighest known to the law\u201d \u2014 and risk personal liability.\n\nWhen fiduciaries add crypto as an investment option, the DOL says, it tells participants that knowledgeable investment experts see it as a prudent option for retirement investing. But the DOL has several reasons why it may not be prudent, and the concerns persist even if bitcoin is offered solely through a brokerage window.\n\nFirst, crypto investments are extremely volatile and speculative and can cause devasting losses to participants \u2014 especially those nearing retirement.\n\nSecond, it is very difficult for participants to make informed investment decisions given the craze over above-market returns. Plan participants, who are generally not investment experts, may expect high returns without fully appreciating the risk of loss to retirement assets. It is extremely difficult, even for professionals, to \u201cseparate the facts from the hype.\u201d\n\nFinally, the DOL expressed concerns with the reliability and accuracy of valuations, the way crypto is custodied (or not), and the evolving regulatory environment.\n\nPlan sponsors should fully understand the fiduciary risk before allowing any plan assets (including through a brokerage window) to be invested in crypto \u2014 including the new ETFs \u2014 and expect to be questioned by the DOL about the prudence of the decision.\n\nThis article appeared in the January 18, 2024, issue of The Journal Record.

        "content": "The spot Bitcoin ETF run by the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, showed its early dominance in becoming the first among a newly approved group of crypto-linked financial products to reach $1 billion in assets under management.\n\nThe firm\u2019s ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), beat out the other 10 exchange-traded products approved by the SEC last week, including those from fellow TradFi stalwarts Fidelity and Franklin Templeton.\n\nReaching $1 billion in assets under management in such a short time would be noteworthy for any ETF, much less one that has faced an uphill battle for approval from the SEC, said Steven Lubka, managing director and head of private clients at Swan Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the history of all ETFs, period, BlackRock is in rarefied air,\u201d Lubka told Fortune.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, said in a statement that the major inflows to IBIT in just one week reflect strong investor demand.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning. We have a long-term commitment focused on providing investors access to an iShares quality ETF,\u201d Mitchnick said in a statement to Fortune.\n\nLubka added that the strength of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF shows that Bitcoin will benefit overall as reliable TradFi firms replace failures such as FTX and Celsius as investors\u2019 entry point to the crypto market. Although in statements the SEC tried to distance itself, the agency\u2019s approval of the ETFs after just over a decade of rejections also helped, Lubka said.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin surged in the aftermath of the approvals last week, its price has since fallen to about $42,400\u2014down from $46,700 a week ago. Lubka said the stall in Bitcoin\u2019s price is likely due to some outflows from Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, which has the highest fee of all the new products at 1.5%. It could also be attributed to some investors managing risk by waiting to see what happens now that the market has been changed by the new TradFi entrants, he added.\n\n\u201cI think, short term, traders realized there\u2019s no catalyst in the next one to two weeks that\u2019s going to drive the price 20% higher\u2014this is going to be a little more on the medium term,\u201d Lubka said."

        "content": "Market enthusiasts call it a \"golden cross,\" indicating a positive shift in asset prices, and now this marker has finally appeared on the bitcoin [BTC] weekly price chart.\n\nThe 50-week simple moving average (SMA) on bitcoin has crossed over the 200-week SMA for the first time on record, confirming the golden cross. The phrase and its counterpart, \"the death cross,\" in which the short-duration SMA dips below the long-duration SMA, originated in Japan, per some technical analysis textbooks.\n\nMany traders see crossovers as forward-looking indicators, with the golden version signaling a long-term bull market ahead.\n\nThe bullish interpretation could be challenged because averages are based on past data and tends to lag prices. In other words, averages represent what happened in the past, and the first golden cross on the weekly chart results from bitcoin rallying over 70% to $42,700 in four months.\n\nThus, seasoned traders consider crossovers as lagging indicators, often coinciding with trend exhaustion. For instance, the weekly death cross confirmed in early 2023 marked the bottom of the bear market. Bitcoin's daily chart golden and death crossovers have a mixed record of predicting bullish and bearish trends.\n\nBitcoin's rally has already stalled, with the cryptocurrency trading 10% lower from highs near $49,000 registered after 11 spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) began trading in the U.S. last Thursday.\n\nPer observers, the bullish momentum has waned due to early ETF flows failing to match the sky-high market expectations.\n\n\"The Net flow of funds for the ETFs has been $965M (including seed funds), a strong start thus far. However, the spot price is down from the launch-driven euphoria as investors set unreasonably high launch expectations,\" Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at NYDIG, said in a newsletter Tuesday."

        "title": "11 New Spot Bitcoin ETFs to Buy in 2024 | Investing | U.S. News - U.S News & World Report Money",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency and fund management industries witnessed a watershed moment on Jan. 10, marking a significant milestone with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of 11 new spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.\n\nThis development signifies a major shift from the previous norm where exchange-traded funds were limited to holding Bitcoin futures. These newly approved Bitcoin ETFs are physically backed by Bitcoin held with a custodian, which offers substantial benefits including lower tracking error and a more direct exposure to the cryptocurrency's price movements.\n\nThis breakthrough follows a tumultuous yet pivotal year in 2023, characterized by a renewed Bitcoin bull run and a landmark legal victory by Grayscale Investments. Following these developments, various ETF providers were quick to amend their prospectuses, positioning themselves at the forefront of this new investment opportunity.\n\nThe days leading up to the SEC's approval were filled with tension, notably marked by the compromise of the SEC's Twitter (now X) account. A false approval was prematurely tweeted on Jan. 9, adding to the suspense and anticipation within the investment community prior to the debut of these ETFs.\n\nThe aftermath of the official approval on Jan. 11 was nothing short of dramatic, with U.S. Bitcoin ETFs experiencing a trading volume surge to $4.6 billion. Bitcoin itself reached a peak of $48,922 during the trading frenzy, reflecting the market's enthusiastic response to this historic decision. Within days, it would be trading below $42,000 once more.\n\nHere's a comprehensive list of all the new Bitcoin ETFs approved by the SEC that are available for trading:\n\nETF Current Expense Ratio Fee waiver? Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker: GBTC) 1.5% No Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF (DEFI) 0.9% No Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) 0% Yes. Through Aug. 2 for first $10 billion in AUM, then 0.19% VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) 0.25% No iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) 0.12% Yes. 12-month waiver for first $5 billion in AUM, then 0.25% Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) 0% Yes. Goes to 0.25% after three months Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) 0% Yes. Six-month waiver for first $5 billion in AUM, then 0.39% WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) 0% Yes. Six-month waiver for first $1 billion in AUM, then 0.3% Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) 0% Yes. Goes to 0.25% on Aug. 1 Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) 0% Yes. After six months or $1 billion in AUM, goes to 0.21% Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) 0% Yes. Six-month waiver on first $1 billion in AUM, then 0.2%\n\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC)\n\nFormerly a closed-ended trust, the reigning king GBTC has now been converted into an open-ended ETF. Its history dates back to 2013 as the world's first publicly traded Bitcoin fund. Currently, it remains the largest Bitcoin ETF with more than $25 billion in assets under management, or AUM, as of Jan. 17.\n\nHowever, the ETF's dominance may be waning slightly. In the opening days of the various Bitcoin ETF launches, GBTC saw some net outflows as investors flocked to the newer, less expensive ETFs. This was largely due to GBTC's continued high expense ratio, which currently sits at 1.5%.\n\nHashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF (DEFI)\n\nDEFI started out a Bitcoin futures ETF, but changes are underway. On Jan. 11, the firm announced a change to the ETF's investment strategy that would allow it to hold spot Bitcoin. The firm anticipates that the ETF's name and strategy will be later changed formally to reflect this modification.\n\nThe main selling point for DEFI is the prospect of investing alongside a firm with dedicated cryptocurrency industry experience. Hashdex is responsible for creations like the Nasdaq Crypto Index, which provides a benchmark for industry enthusiasts. DEFI charges a 0.9% expense ratio.\n\nFranklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC)\n\nKnown for its extensive lineup of international equity funds, Franklin Templeton has also thrown its hat into the Bitcoin ETF space with EZBC. This ETF tracks spot Bitcoin held with a trusted custodian, which in this case is Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN).\n\nEZBC is traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and has so far has attracted around $49 million in AUM, representing 1,160 Bitcoin as of Jan. 17. The ETF is currently waiving fees to zero through Aug. 2 for the first $10 billion of AUM.\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL)\n\nHODL's ticker name is a humorous reference to the cryptocurrency pop culture motto of \"hold on for dear life.\" Many cryptocurrency investors use \"HODL\" to describe an unwillingness to sell their Bitcoin even during periods of high volatility or a prolonged \"crypto winter,\" when prices are in the doldrums.\n\nThe ETF itself has accumulated about $86 million in AUM through Jan. 17, with an expense ratio of 0.25%. Like DEFI, it is also traded on the CBOE. For those seeking even higher exposure, VanEck anticipates HODL will have an options chain, but this is currently unavailable.\n\niShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)\n\nBlackRock Inc. (BLK), one of the world's largest asset managers, also took part in the Bitcoin ETF race with IBIT, which debuted on the Nasdaq exchange. This ETF initially charged a 0.25% expense ratio, but BlackRock has since waived that by half to 0.12% for the first $5 billion of AUM over a 12-month period.\n\nSo far, IBIT has been quite successful, reportedly cracking the $1 billion AUM figure on Jan. 18, less than a week after its debut. BlackRock has also done a fairly good job of keeping this ETF liquid, with a median bid-ask spread of 0.04% as of Jan. 18.\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)\n\nAs with HODL, BRRR's ticker may also be a humorous reference to the sound of money being printed. The ETF trades on the Nasdaq exchange alongside IBIT, and is currently waiving its regular 0.25% expense ratio to zero for the first three months in an effort to attract investors.\n\nAs with EZBC, BRRR's underlying Bitcoin will be held with Coinbase as its custodian. So far, the ETF has attracted more than $62 million in net assets, corresponding to around 1,485 Bitcoin at the time of this writing. The benchmark index for this ETF is the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate - New York Variant.\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO)\n\nInvesco Ltd. (IVZ) has also expanded into the Bitcoin ETF space. The firm's offering here is BTCO, which currently has about $137 million in AUM as of Jan. 17. As with some of the previous ETFs, Invesco is waiving fees from 0.39% to zero for a six-month period on the first $5 billion in AUM.\n\n\"In addition to offering a simpler, more familiar access point to Bitcoin, BTCO brings together the unparalleled expertise of a veteran ETF provider like Invesco and an established crypto native like Galaxy,\" says Kathy Kriskey, senior ETF strategist at Invesco.\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW)\n\nDespite being known more for its lineup of fundamentally weighted dividend funds, WisdomTree hasn't shied away from entering the Bitcoin ETF competition. Going up against industry heavyweights like BlackRock and Grayscale, the firm launched BTCW as its spot Bitcoin ETF offering.\n\nTo attract inflows, BTCW has also implemented a fee waiver. For a six-month period commencing Jan. 11, the ETF is waiving its 0.3% expense ratio to zero for the first $1 billion in AUM. However, the ETF is still off to a fairly slow start with just $3.1 million in AUM accumulated through Jan. 17.\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC)\n\nFBTC isn't actually Fidelity's first spot Bitcoin ETF. On Nov. 30, 2021, the firm launched the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) in Canada. This was possible as the Canadian securities regulator permitted the debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs far earlier than the SEC did.\n\nWith the SEC decision in the books, Fidelity is now free to levy its substantial presence and marketing resources to ensure the U.S. version of FBTC becomes a success. This includes wading into the ongoing fee war with a waiver as well, reducing FBTC's expense ratio from 0.25% to zero. On Aug. 1, the 0.25% fee is slated to return.\n\nArk 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)\n\nArk Invest and its star manager, Cathie Wood, have been no strangers to headlines in recent years. Wood regularly has her fund's trades covered in media, such as a recent purchase of Tesla Inc. (TSLA) by the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) and the Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).\n\nThanks to a partnership with 21Shares, Ark Invest now offers Bitcoin exposure as well through ARKB. Listed on the CBOE, ARKB has managed to attract just $10.3 million in inflows through Jan. 10, making it a bit of a laggard in the race. Like the other ETFs, it is also temporarily waiving its expense ratio. Once it attracts $1 billion in AUM, or when six months have passed, whichever comes sooner, it will charge a 0.21% expense ratio.\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB)\n\nBitwise is one of the few firms to list its Bitcoin ETF on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE. This dedicated cryptocurrency asset manager debuted BITB and has achieved strong success in the opening days of the Bitcoin ETF race with $354 million in AUM through Jan. 17."

        "content": "DAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Bitcoin does nothing, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.\n\n\"I call it the pet rock,\" he added.\n\nDimon is a long-time bitcoin critic. The bank chief said in 2021 at peak crypto valuations that bitcoin was \"worthless,\" and he doubled down on that sentiment last year in Davos, Switzerland, when he told CNBC that the digital currency was a \"hyped-up fraud.\"\n\nBitcoin is trading just above $42,700, up more than 100% in the past year.\n\n\"This is the last time I'm talking about this with CNBC, so help me God,\" Dimon said. \"Blockchain is real. It's a technology. We use it. It's going to move money, it's going to move data. It's efficient. We've been talking about that for 12 years, too, and it's very small.\"\n\n\"I think we waste too many words on that,\" Dimon added.\n\nThe bank chief went on to distinguish bitcoin from the other class of cryptocurrencies, the ones by which blockchain has enabled the use of smart contracts. Smart contracts are a programmable piece of code written on a public blockchain, such as ethereum , which executes when certain conditions are met, negating the need for a central intermediary.\n\n\"There's a cryptocurrency which might actually do something,\" Dimon said of smart chain-enriched blockchains. \"You can use it to buy and sell real estate and move data \u2014 tokenizing things that you do something with.\"\n\n\"And then there's one which does nothing,\" Dimon said of bitcoin, though he added that there were real use cases for the virtual coin, which included upward of $100 billion a year caught up in fraud, tax avoidance and sex trafficking. \"I defend your right to do bitcoin,\" Dimon added, saying, \"I don't want to tell you what to do. So my personal advice would be don't get involved. \u2026 But it's a free country.\"\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of more than $830 billion, was cemented as an asset class last week when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the creation of bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nSome of the biggest names in asset management, including BlackRock , Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree, have launched their own spot bitcoin ETFs last week. For the $30 trillion advised wealth management industry, the floodgates could be about to open. Analysts at Standard Chartered anticipate fund inflows in the range of $50 billion to $100 billion in 2024.\n\nWhen asked what he made of Larry Fink changing his view on bitcoin as BlackRock jumped into the spot ETF business, Dimon said, \"I don't care. So just please stop talking about this s***.\"\n\n\"I don't know what he would say about blockchain versus currencies that do something versus bitcoin that does nothing,\" Dimon added. \"But you know this is what makes a market. People have opinions, and this is the last time I'm ever going to state my opinion.\""

        "content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is done talking about Bitcoin\u2014again.\n\nIn a CNBC interview from Davos, a visibly amused Dimon declared he was swearing off opining about the crypto currency. When asked about the new Bitcoin ETF the Securities and Exchange Commission approved last week, Dimon interrupted CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin, also of The New York Times, to say:\n\n\u201cSo this is an important thing, this is the last time I\u2019m ever going to talk about this on CNBC\u2014so help me God,\u201d Dimon said to laughs from studio hosts Sorkin, Joe Kernen, and Becky Quick.\n\nThat sort of exasperation has become a Dimon staple when discussing Bitcoin. He\u2019s been saying he\u2019ll never talk about Bitcoin again since as far back as 2017.\n\nDimon continued his criticism of Bitcoin, saying \u201cit does nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI call it the pet rock,\u201d he said.\n\nDimon then corrected himself to say he did think Bitcoin did actually have some uses. They just all happened to be illegal such as money laundering, fraud, tax avoidance, or as payment for sex trafficking, he said.\n\nThere is evidence to support Dimon\u2019s claim. The Government Accountability Office found that 15 of the 27 online commercial sex websites it examined in a June 2021 report accepted digital currencies. While the U.N. issued warnings that cryptocurrency platforms are often used for money laundering by criminal groups in Southeast Asia.\n\nDespite these concerns, the market for cryptocurrencies has been exceptionally strong in recent years after a near-death experience during 2022\u2019s \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d In 2023, the market capitalization for the entire crypto industry grew 95%, although it\u2019s still down 35% from its all-time high during the pandemic. Also, the SEC\u2019s recent ETF approval is a signal that crypto is becoming a legitimate financial asset. And despite Dimon\u2019s objections to owning cryptocurrency himself, many retail investors do. A study from 2022 found that 36% of millennials and 20% of total adults own cryptocurrencies.\n\nDimon\u2019s history of Bitcoin talk\n\nOver the years, Dimon has been open about his dislike for cryptocurrencies, calling people who invest in Bitcoin \u201cstupid,\u201d and once threatening to fire any employee caught investing in it. Meanwhile, he called the asset itself a \u201chyped-up fraud\u201d and a \u201cwaste of time.\u201d At a Senate hearing in December, Dimon said if it were up to him he\u2019d \u201cclose it down,\u201d earning a surprised reaction from crypto hawk Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)\n\nOther major financial firms like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs had similar positions before changing their minds as crypto became more popular and lucrative. In 2020, Goldman Sachs published an analyst note explaining why it didn\u2019t consider Bitcoin an asset class that was widely shared in both Wall Street and crypto circles. And while its investment chief is still wary of Bitcoin, CEO David Solomon signaled Goldman Sachs would be interested in acquiring bargain crypto companies.\n\nWhen CNBC asked Dimon about companies that offer crypto products to their clients, he replied with the same dismissiveness he reserved for the asset itself.\n\n\u201cNumber one I don\u2019t care,\u201d he told Sorkin. \u201cSo just please stop talking about this shit.\u201d\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink was once in Dimon\u2019s camp as a staunch Bitcoin critic, concerned it had limited use beyond criminal activity. In 2017, Fink famously called Bitcoin the \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d and that the only it was good for was illustrating how much demand there was for that specific financial crime. Fink would eventually change his tune, though. By 2020, he believed it could grow into a global market. Fast forward to this month, when Bitcoin got the stamp of approval to become a spot ETF and BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, owns the third most Bitcoins of any public company.\n\nFellow asset manager Fidelity was early to embrace Bitcoin. It began mining the cryptocurrency in 2014, before launching its first trading platform in 2018. While BlackRock\u2019s other competitors, State Street and Vanguard, the world\u2019s second and third largest asset managers respectively, have opted to stay away from Bitcoin altogether.\n\n\u201cThe investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak,\u201d Vanguard told Bloomberg in December. \u201cUnlike stocks and bonds, most crypto assets lack intrinsic economic value and generate no cash flows.\n\nThat line of thinking was similar to Dimon\u2019s, who in his CNBC interview raised repeated concerns over Bitcoin\u2019s ultimate function\u2014aside from, as he said, aiding and abetting crime. Instead, Dimon sought to differentiate between Bitcoin and blockchain, the technology which allows Bitcoin to be traded without the approval of a centralized agency. Bitcoin\u2019s defenders tout the ability to trade the asset without having to rely on a bank or clearing authority as the core benefit that makes it unlike any other currency or asset. Blockchain, according to Dimon, was useful for exchanging assets or data. Although he thought even on that topic enough ink had been spilled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very small,\u201d he said of blockchain. \u201cI think we\u2019ve wasted too many words on that.\u201d"

But one event is undeniable. And its impact on the world's most premiered digital assets.\n\nThe halving. Every four years, the reward for mining, the biggest cryptocurrency is cut in half. This happens in order to reduce the amount of coins in circulation.\n\nHow is it calculated? Well, it happens specifically every time 210,000 blocks are mined. We can calculate the date fairly precisely with the knowledge that the average block time for Bitcoin mining is around 10 minutes.\n\nThat calculation gets us very close to four years. Why is it needed? Because there's only so much Bitcoin available.\n\n21 million to be exact. And like any other cryptocurrency, it needs to remain scarce to hold its value. So how often does this happen?\n\nWell, the halving takes place every four years. The first in 2012. Decreased the award for creating a new block from 50 to 25 Bitcoin.\n\nThe second halving in 2016, that lowered the reward further from 25 Bitcoin to 12.5 Bitcoin. The last time out, 2020. And you guessed it. We have it again, the block award dropping to 6.25 Bitcoin.\n\nSo there's nothing wrong with your math here. This time around, the block reward miners will receive half, 3.125 Bitcoin. The big question, of course, what happens to the price?\n\nNow, the moves could be significant. In the past, we've seen Bitcoin rise after halving event. Though there's no certainty that this will always be the outcome.\n\nThe other key focus is the outcome for the miners. The rewards that they're generating will, of course, diminish. And that's not great for an industry with a very high cost burden.\n\nKeep an eye on how the big publicly listed miners, the likes of marathon, and riot manage this event as ever talks of consolidation will no doubt do the rounds. No matter how you look at it, the event will have serious consequences for all crypto stakeholders and will be across all of the developments here at Yahoo Finance."

        "title": "If spot bitcoin ETFs are so great, why's the bitcoin price down? - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nFollowing their approval by the US securities regulators a week ago, about $3bn gross has flowed into spot bitcoin ETFs and bitcoin\u2019s spot price is down 9 per cent. Bitcoin\u2019s slide is inconvenient for crypto promoters who said spot ETFs would be crypto\u2019s watershed moment, though they have plenty of tradfi-proven excuses: profit taking, better to travel than arrive, buy the rumour sell the news, etc.\n\nA neater explanation involves Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, a publicly listed bitcoin warehouse that led the lobbying for US spot ETFs to be legalised. GBTC had since 2017 been operating a bitcoin lobster pot: anyone with bitcoins could give them to Grayscale Investments in exchange for OTC-traded shares in the trust, but there was no way to get the bitcoins back.\n\nGBTC last week converted to an ETF, giving its backers their first opportunity to reclaim the $28bn or thereabouts of bitcoin it had collected. And in the four days following spot ETF approval GBTC redemptions have totalled more than $1.6bn.\n\nIt\u2019s been industry practice to assume all the coins previously trapped in GBTC are being reallocated to cheaper ETFs, meaning at-launch net inflow falls to $1.4bn-ish \u2014 but fund reallocation shouldn\u2019t move the bitcoin price; there\u2019s no net selling pressure.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible, however, that some GBTC shareholders just want to cash out. And though it\u2019s silly to draw conclusions from only four days of data, it\u2019s interesting that GBTC redemptions on Tuesday exceeded total inflows for all the other US spot ETFs.\n\nHere\u2019s a chart from JPMorgan, whose analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou expects an overhang from previously trapped GBTC punters to remain for a while yet:\n\nIt looks like GBTC investors who over the past year had been buying the GBTC fund at a significant discount to NAV to position for its eventual ETF conversion, have been taking full profit post ETF conversion by exiting the bitcoin space entirely rather than shifting to cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs. We had previously estimated that up to $3bn had been invested into GBTC in the secondary market during 2023 in order to take advantage of the discount to NAV. If the previous $3bn estimate proves correct and given $1.5bn has exited already then there could be an additional $1.5bn still to exit the bitcoin space via profit taking on GBTC, thus putting further pressure on bitcoin prices over the coming weeks. Whatever the motive behind the past few days $1.5bn of outflows from GBTC, these outflows are exerting pressure on GBTC to lower its fees. The GBTC fee at 1.5% still looks too high compared to other spot bitcoin ETFs risking further outflows even if for some institutional investors fees are not the only reason to consider when deciding whether to shift to cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs. Liquidity and market depth also matter but again there is risk for GBTC on that front also if other spot bitcoin ETFs manage to reach critical mass in terms of size and liquidity. A lot more capital, perhaps an additional $5bn-$10bn, could exit GBTC if it loses its liquidity advantage.\n\nOther places to look for rotation are among futures-based bitcoin ETFs, which have bled out by about $300mn since last Thursday, and from exchange accounts. Panigirtzoglou highlights that since spot ETFs were legalised, on-chain cumulative bitcoin flow by smaller digital wallets \u2014 an imperfect proxy for retail punting \u2014 has ticked a tiny bit lower.\n\nJPMorgan says that if retail brokers and exchanges aren\u2019t quick enough cut fees then approximately $36bn ex GBCT could rotate into spot bitcoin ETFs. Its base case however is that exchanges will retaliate, the price war escalates, and spot BTC ETFs inflows fall short of the highest expectations.\n\nWhichever way, for bitcoin\u2019s price, it\u2019s all a nil-sum game at best.\n\nFurther reading\n\n\u2014 Talk to your kids about their spot bitcoin ETF use (FTAV)\n\n\u2014 Imaginary bitcoin ETFs are already 30 times more valuable than all the actual bitcoin ETFs (FTAV)"

        "content": "Key Takeaways BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF, or IBIT, held more than $1 billion in bitcoin just five days after it began trading.\n\nIBIT is the second spot bitcoin ETF to achieve this milestone, with Grayscale Bitcoin Trust still dominating the market.\n\nDespite Grayscale's dominance, market data indicates funds are flowing out of their spot bitcoin ETF into alternatives from BlackRock, Fidelity, and others.\n\nAnalysts say retail investor demand for spot bitcoin ETFs is modest, but that may be because not all brokerages offer access to the product.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from BlackRock (BLK) now holds more than $1 billion worth of bitcoin, reaching the milestone just five days after the exchange-traded fund (ETF) began trading on Jan. 11.\n\nIBIT's was a quick sprint to $1 billion, but not the fastest. SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) pulled in $1 billion in just three days back in 2004, according to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\nWhat's Happening With Spot Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nAlthough spot bitcoin ETFs were first listed on U.S. exchanges just last week, there are already some clear winners and losers emerging in the race for dominance in this niche market.\n\nDespite significant outflows, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) still accounts for nearly 90% of the market, according to data shared by Bloomberg Analyst James Seyffart. That dominance is largely thanks to its previous existence as a trust before its conversion to an ETF.\n\nBlackRock's IBIT and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) have been the most prominent alternatives for investors exiting GBTC following their approval last week by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nBlackRock head of US iShares product, Rachel Aguirre told Bloomberg TV that the ETF is seeing flows from many different directions, including from retail investors and self-directed investors.\n\nWho Is Buying Spot Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nAccording to Vanda Research, retail investor appetite for spot bitcoin ETFs remains \"modest.\" That could also be a function of access to these products. Some brokerages, such as Vanguard, are not offering the spot bitcoin ETFs to their clients while others are offering only a few among those available.\n\nThe spot bitcoin ETF market as a whole is expected to grow in the coming years, with some analysts predicting it to grow to $100 billion. In terms of new money coming into the bitcoin (BTCUSD) space, Morgan Creek Capital CEO Mark Yusko has said these new products could open the door for as much as $300 billion to enter the bitcoin market."

This decision follows the launch of VanEck's spot bitcoin ETF offering last week.\n\n\"Now that our spot bitcoin ETF has been approved, we are closing our ETF that invested in bitcoin futures,\" VanEck posted on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter).\n\nVanEck's XBTF is scheduled to end trading on Jan. 30. The ETF held just over $53 million worth of bitcoin futures contracts at the time of the liquidation announcement. As a comparison, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which is also a futures-based bitcoin ETF offering, has roughly $1.9 billion in assets, according to Morningstar.\n\nThe asset manager said that it \"evaluates its ETF offerings across a number of factors, including performance, liquidity, assets under management, and investor interest, among others. The decision was made to liquidate the Fund based on an analysis of these factors and other operational considerations.\"\n\nVanEck's spot bitcoin ETF, known as the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL), quickly surpassed XBTF in terms of total net assets. That said, it is still one of the also-rans compared with the rest of the market, with around $80 million in assets as of Tuesday.\n\nDespite signs that some investors are moving into spot bitcoin ETF offerings from Blackrock (IBIT) and Fidelity (FBTC), the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is still by far the largest bitcoin ETF offering in the world with roughly $26 billion in net assets.\n\nThe 10 spot bitcoin ETFs that currently exist in the U.S. hold roughly $28 billion worth of bitcoin, but some experts believe that number could rise to as much as $100 billion over time.\n\n"

        "content": "Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed silver ETFs in the United States, securing their position as the second-largest ETF commodity, in terms of assets under management (AUM). The surge in popularity of Bitcoin ETFs signals a growing acceptance of BTC as a mainstream investment vehicle.\n\nAs reported by The Block, Bitcoin's ascent to becoming the second-largest ETF commodity in the U.S. marks a significant milestone for the Bitcoin market. This achievement is attributed to the increasing demand from institutional and retail investors seeking exposure to BTC.\n\nSilver, which has ~$11.5 billion in AUM across five silver ETFs, was passed by spot Bitcoin ETFs which now hold over $28 billion, less than a week after going live.\n\n\"Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded silver ETFs in the U.S. in terms of size, driven by the substantial market interest they have received,\" Bitfinex Head of Derivatives Jag Kooner told The Block. \"The level of trading reflects the pent-up demand for these products, and we expect that it will lead to increased liquidity and stability in the market.\"\n\nThis development is particularly noteworthy given silver's traditional status as a prominent commodity investment. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs to the second position underscores Bitcoin's maturation within the financial markets, gaining credibility and recognition as a formidable investment option.\n\nInvestors' growing appetite for Bitcoin ETFs reflects a broader trend of diversification within portfolios and a recognition of the unique value proposition offered by BTC. As the Bitcoin market continues to evolve, the achievement of surpassing silver ETFs solidifies Bitcoin's position as a major player in the global financial landscape.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

The inflows were offset by $1.18bn of outflows at Grayscale, which converted its existing $28bn bitcoin fund into an ETF alongside the new launches.\n\nAnalysts believe the bulk of the outflows is likely to be investors moving to one of the new funds, which all charge lower fees than Grayscale. Excluding the outflows at Grayscale, the 10 new ETFs have drawn in just over $2bn.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts celebrated the approval of the funds by the US Securities and Exchange Commission last week after more than a decade of rejections. Supporters hope it will attract new investors to the token and boost its price in the long term.\n\nGrowing speculation that the SEC would approve so-called spot bitcoin ETFs had pushed the price of bitcoin up more than 70 per cent since October. However, bitcoin has fallen roughly 6 per cent since their approval.\n\n\u201cBy no means was this launch a mass success,\u201d said Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions. \u201cBitcoin\u2019s latest price action shows that this has so far been an underwhelming launch for products that were so highly anticipated.\u201d\n\nThe funds\u2019 collective performance also fell short of the $1bn that ProShares pulled in on its first two days after launching a bitcoin futures ETF in October 2021.\n\nGrayscale, which has run a bitcoin trust since 2013, helped open the door to regulatory approval for bitcoin ETFs after winning a court victory against the SEC last year. But analysts said its conversion last week offered investors an opportunity to exit their holdings.\n\nPreviously, investors had been able to sell their holdings only in the over-the-counter market, and they often traded at a large discount to the price of bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of shuffling around of deck chairs . . . because Grayscale was trading as a closed-end fund for so long, but as soon as it became an ETF it became liquid, so it\u2019s not surprising to see selling pressure coming from Grayscale,\u201d said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.\n\nAnalysts also pointed out that Grayscale charged a 1.5 per cent fee, which is more than a percentage point higher than new market entrants.\n\n\u201cFollowing a sharp run-up in valuations, it\u2019s natural to see some profit-taking from the investment community,\u201d said Zach Pandl, Grayscale\u2019s managing director for research.\n\nSome brokers have declined to offer trading in the new bitcoin ETFs. Vanguard, the world\u2019s second-largest asset manager, said the new products \u201cdid not align with its offer of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio\u201d.\n\nAnalysts said flows into bitcoin ETFs would take time to materialise as advisers became comfortable enough with the products to recommend them as additions to client portfolios.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about day one. This is new for a lot of clients,\u201d said an executive at one of the issuers who declined to be identified. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time to have a full education and understand its role in a portfolio and ultimately choose to make an allocation to a product. What I\u2019m most excited about is the long-term prospects. We are giving access to an entirely new market.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting from Steve Johnson in London"

        "content": "For the past several months, the main event in crypto has been the looming approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The new ETFs have gone through a lengthy application process with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with several amendments, meetings and lengthy filings \u2014 a process that has brought immense hype to Bitcoin.\n\nThe ETFs are expected to bring a new host of investors to the token. This is because the ETFs improve upon the current Bitcoin ETFs, which use futures to loosely track the price of Bitcoin. This results in price discrepancies between the current ETFs and Bitcoin, as well as high fees. For example, The ProShares Bitcoin Trust (BITO) is up just over 100% in the last year, but Bitcoin is up well over 150%. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is another futures-linked ETF, and it charges fees of 2%. This is well above the average for ETFs.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it ?\n\nThe last-standing top crypto exchange without a major security breach offers what now?\n\nThe spot ETFs hope to solve these issues. Instead of using futures, they will hold the Bitcoins themselves and use this to create shares of an ETF. This eliminates the price difference that exists with the current futures ETFs. Additionally, the spot ETFs have low fees, with most around 0.25%. Some ETFs also have incentives that offer smaller or even no fees for some of the first buyers. For example, the ARK and 21Share's ETF (ARKB) is offering no fees on the first $1 billion in transactions.\n\nWhile there have been several applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the past, most were denied or pulled back because of regulatory and infrastructure concerns. However, in April 2023, ARK and 21Shares announced a partnership to apply for their own spot Bitcoin ETF. This partnership was particularly notable due to ARK's expertise in technology ETFs and 21Shares\u2019 expertise in crypto asset management.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeveral other applications came in the summer and fall of 2023, such as BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, WisdomTree Inc., Grayscale Investments, Bitwise and VanEck.\n\nTrending: Don't buy the top this time around. Reboot your crypto portfolio today.\n\nAs more companies applied, met with the SEC and discussed their ETFs publicly, the hype surrounding Bitcoin grew larger. For instance, when BlackRock submitted its application in June, the price of Bitcoin went up 5% within a week.\n\nIf you had invested $1,000 in Bitcoin in April 2023 when ARK and 21Shares announced their application, you would have $1,654.\n\nOn the day of the application, Bitcoin closed at $28,415. Earlier this week, the price briefly traded above $47,000, resulting in a 65% price increase.\n\nFor reference, in the same timeframe, the Nasdaq Stock Market is up just over 30%, and Ethereum is up just over 21%.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWhether you have $10 or $10,000, you can start trading crypto today.\n\nFunders on this alternative asset platform are earning more than 14% annualized consignment profit funding Pro consignment opportunities.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article If You Invested $1,000 In Bitcoin When ETFs Were Filed, Here's What You'd Have Today originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nUS asset managers are vying to launch exchange traded funds with leveraged bitcoin exposure and expand into bitcoin-based options and other cryptocurrencies after last week\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nProShares this week disclosed plans to launch five ETFs, including one that would offer twice the daily exposure to a bitcoin-tracking index and others to provide inverse bitcoin returns, paying out up to double any decline in an underlying index, according to filings with the SEC. The extra leverage in the ETFs \u2014 which are not designed to be long-term investments \u2014 would amplify swings experienced by the already volatile bitcoin price.\n\nProShares, which declined to comment on the filings, is working in the newly unencumbered part of the market alongside firms such as Grayscale Investments, which last week filed to launch a product that will sell options on its $26bn bitcoin ETF. So are asset managers including BlackRock, which is looking to widen its massive ETF line-up to include exposure to other cryptocurrencies \u2014 foreshadowing future clashes with wary regulators.\n\n\u201cI see value in having an ethereum ETF,\u201d BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink told CNBC last week. Ethereum is a widely used blockchain with its own cryptocurrency (ether, or ETH, the second-largest token behind bitcoin). The SEC in October allowed a number of ether futures ETFs to launch.\n\nAny such strategy will need to pass muster with the SEC, which approved spot bitcoin ETFs after years of reluctance and with serious reservations.\n\nSEC chair Gary Gensler cautioned in his statement about the spot bitcoin ETF approvals that they did not \u201csignal anything about the commission\u2019s views as to the status of other crypto assets under the federal securities laws or about the current state of non-compliance of certain crypto asset market participants with the federal securities laws\u201d.\n\nEther ETFs were likely to face \u201csignificant hurdles to overcome, but if the SEC denies it, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the end of the story,\u201d Chris Brodersen, a managing director specialising in blockchain and digital assets at accounting firm EisnerAmper. \u201cI think these companies will do exactly what they did with bitcoin, which is go back and look for more clarity if necessary or look to the courts for some relief and try again.\u201d\n\nThe SEC\u2019s loss in a legal battle with Grayscale last year is widely seen as a turning point away from nearly a decade of denial, allowing bitcoin ETFs to pull in nearly $900mn in their first three days of trading earlier this month despite more than $1bn of outflows from Grayscale\u2019s ETF.\n\nVarious US issuers have previously secured approval for double-leveraged and inverse ETFs. Covered call ETFs, which sell options on underlying holdings to generate income, have boomed in popularity in recent years.\n\nJoe Hall, an attorney at Davis Polk, which advised Grayscale on its recent bitcoin ETF conversion, described the proposed leveraged and options-based bitcoin strategies as natural extensions.\n\n\u201cHow long that takes, I couldn\u2019t tell you, but if there\u2019s already analogues in ETF land or financial derivatives on the basic product, I suspect that those all end up being approved one way or the other,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a very different question once you get outside of bitcoin.\u201d"

There may be a further temporary weakness in bitcoin, with a potential short-term bottom in the $38,000-$42,000 range for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, the report said. Still, investors should be \"structurally long\" ahead of the next halving event , expected in April. In a separate note on Wednesday, Bernstein reiterated its bullish call on the miners. The broker recommends \u201cachieving bitcoin exposure via bitcoin miners that offer a higher-beta than bitcoin driven by EBITDA expansion and market multiple growth into the bull cycle.\u201d Bernstein says it prefers outperform rated stocks Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK).

        "content": "Late last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission somewhat begrudgingly approved a spot bitcoin ETFs. If you\u2019re not up on your finance acronyms, that stands for exchange traded fund \u2014 you can think of it as a very easy way to invest in bitcoin from your brokerage account, no blockchain required. A \u201cspot\u201d fund invests in the asset directly, as opposed to making bets on futures contracts.\n\nWhenever I write about bitcoin, I usually mention the price \u2014 about $42,000 right now for one \u2014 and then say something like \u201cplease consult your financial adviser\u201d right afterward.\n\nSo in light of the news of this new route for bitcoin investment, I consulted with some financial advisers about what they\u2019re telling their clients.\n\nI asked certified financial planner Paul Brahim how frequently his clients ask about bitcoin.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s easier to ask if there are any clients who haven\u2019t asked about bitcoin, right?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an ongoing dialogue since bitcoin emerged, how many years ago?\u201d\n\nBrahim is a managing director at Wealth Enhancement Group. Before the spot ETFs, Brahim could kind of brush off bitcoin. He would tell clients it\u2019s risky and unregulated, and if you lose the keys to your crypto wallet, you\u2019ve just lost all your money.\n\nNow he will tell clients something like, \u201cIf you want some bitcoin in your portfolio, that\u2019s fine, let\u2019s just make sure it\u2019s an amount of money more appropriate for roulette than retirement.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put this in the casino capital category as opposed to core,\u201d he said.\n\nMatt Hougan at Bitwise Asset Management said he\u2019s been getting lots of calls from financial advisers about the spot bitcoin ETF his firm launched last week. But he doesn\u2019t expect to win over the crypto-skeptical overnight.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re gonna study it for months and months and months before they tiptoe into the waters,\u201d he said.\n\nHougan said he expects adviser attitudes toward bitcoin to follow a similar trajectory to when gold first got an ETF in 2003.\n\n\u201cWe called people who invested in gold \u2018goldbugs.\u2019 We talked about tin foil hats. They gathered in dusty convention halls off the Strip in Las Vegas to talk about this barbarous relic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the ETF moved that mainstream.\u201d\n\nHougan said bitcoin ETFs aren\u2019t for everybody. That may include many ESG investors \u2014 people who want to deploy capital with environmental, social and governance goals in mind.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the Boulder, Colorado, area, so of course almost everybody is ESG investment interested,\u201d said Dan Yerger, president of MY Wealth Planners. \u201cThat is actually a big hindrance for it.\u201d\n\nAs of 2022, over 50% of bitcoin mining was powered by coal and gas."

        "content": "After receiving dozens of applications, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally gave the green light to 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Jan. 10. The decision is expected to bring new hype and investors into Bitcoin because it allows for a new, equity-based form of investment into the cryptocurrency.\n\nWhile much of the discussion around the benefits of Bitcoin ETFs has been focused on firms sponsoring them and new investors, one party has been left out of the discussion.\n\nThe custodian of the ETFs also plays a major role in making them available to the everyday investor. Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) houses the Bitcoin for 10 out of the 13 spot Bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it ?\n\nThe last-standing top crypto exchange without a major security breach offers what now?\n\nAn ETF works by a sponsoring firm collecting a pool of assets and dividing them into shares that can be sold to investors. Most of the time, the sponsoring firm can hold the assets itself. For instance, the most popular ETF \u2014 SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NASDAQ) SPY \u2014 is a collection of all the stocks in the S&P 500. Sponsoring firm State Street Global Advisors holds the individual stocks.\n\nRegulations make this more difficult for sponsoring companies In the case of Bitcoin ETFs. Because of this, the companies must look elsewhere for a place to house Bitcoin, which they can then package into shares and deliver to investors.\n\nThe logical choice for most of the spot Bitcoin ETFs was Coinbase. As the largest crypto trading platform in the world, the ETF sponsors are confident that they can trust Coinbase with the role of custodian.\n\nCoinbase is known for its safety and security for investors as well as low transaction fees. Cybersecurity and the history of safety are the most important issues for the ETFs. Since the beginning of crypto, hacks have been commonplace. However, Coinbase's security measures use machine learning, two-factor authentication and a vault system to ensure that users' investments are safe. This was particularly attractive for ETFs looking for a custodian.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, whenever the ETFs create new shares, they must buy Bitcoin on Coinbase. Then they can use those Bitcoins to create new shares. Most ETFs are constantly creating new shares, so this could bring sustained institutional activity to the Coinbase platform.\n\nThough its role can be overlooked, Coinbase has a lot to gain from the custodial partnership with the new spot Bitcoin ETFs. Looking to the future, the decision to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs could also pave the way for other spot ETFs, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). If these spot ETFs become a reality, Coinbase could also be the custodian for those.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Why Coinbase (COIN) Is The Biggest Winner From Bitcoin ETF Pending Approvals originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

The bank had previously estimated that up to $3 billion had been invested in GBTC in the secondary market during 2023 to exploit the trust\u2019s discount to NAV. If this estimate is correct, and given that $1.5 billion has already exited, there could be an additional $1.5 billion to exit the space via profit-taking on GBTC, which will put further pressure on bitcoin prices in the coming weeks. These outflows are also putting pressure on GBTC to lower its fees, the report said, adding that the \u201cGBTC fee at 1.5% still looks too high compared to other spot bitcoin ETFs risking further outflows.\u201d \u201cA lot more capital, perhaps an additional $5 billion-$10 billion, could exit GBTC if it loses its liquidity advantage,\u201d the bank cautioned.

        "content": "While US spot bitcoin ETFs may shrink the premium at which MicroStrategy stock trades relative to BTC, the company\u2019s shares are set to continue offering certain advantages over such funds, some industry watchers say.\n\nSome investors have historically used the shares of business intelligence firm MicroStrategy as a sort of proxy for BTC given the company\u2019s large stack of the asset.\n\nMicroStrategy is the largest publicly traded holder of bitcoin \u2014 with holdings totaling 189,150 BTC, as of Dec. 26.\n\nBut the milestone launch of spot bitcoin ETFs last week gives investors a new access point to more easily gain BTC exposure.\n\nRead more: MicroStrategy stock has advantages over planned spot bitcoin ETFs: Saylor\n\nTD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza said earlier this month he expected US spot bitcoin ETFs to substantially increase the price of bitcoin and compress the premium at which MicroStrategy trades relative to bitcoin \u2014 results set to cause \u201ca material rise in the price of MSTR stock.\u201d\n\nThe premium that MicroStrategy shares trade to bitcoin could fall from roughly 40% to between 15% and 25%, Vitanza added at the time.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s share price was down 18.5% in the last five days, as of market close Thursday. Bitcoin\u2019s price was down at the time about 4.5% over that span.\n\nVitanza and research associate Jonnathan Navarrete wrote in a Jan. 16 research note that while the ETF launches have driven down MicroStrategy\u2018s bitcoin premium, the company shares offer unique benefits.\n\n\u201cChief among these benefits is that shareholders pay no management fee; corporate overhead is borne by the cash flows associated with its operating enterprise software business,\u201d the TD Cowen analysts wrote. \u201cIn fact, even net of its corporate overhead, the company\u2019s free cash flow effectively serves as a \u2018reverse fee\u2019 paid not by shareholders, but to shareholders.\u201d\n\nTD Cowen values MicroStrategy\u2019s operating software business at $1.25 billion, Vitanza and Navarrete note. Q3 revenues from MicroStrategy\u2019s software licenses and subscription services were $45 million and $21 million, respectively.\n\nDan Weiskopf, a co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK), told Blockworks the latest pull-back on MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price was \u201cnatural\u201d given it was up more than two times bitcoin\u2019s price last year.\n\nHe noted that while he believes MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor and his team have been smart about how they manage their capital structure and buy more bitcoin, the availability of spot bitcoin ETFs gives investors more optionality.\n\nRead more: BlackRock beats spot bitcoin ETF rivals in race to $1B assets\n\n\u201cThe question is whether investors in bitcoin through MicroStrategy want to sell and pay [capital gains] to buy an ETF,\u201d Weiskopf said. \u201cCurrently, the valuation on enterprise value seems interesting to us in the short term, assuming 190,000 BTC at the current price and the cheap debt.\u201d\n\nThe company launched a product in October designed to allow organizations to incorporate generative artificial intelligence into their data applications.\n\n\u201cMy question around MicroStrategy is where they go with the software business and whether there is a real AI kicker in the stock,\u201d Weiskopf added.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF Tracker\n\nJeff Ross, founder of Vailshire Capital Management, said during an X space Thursday that he believes bitcoin miners and MicroStrategy are likely to outperform BTC in the event of an upcoming bull market.\n\n\u201cPersonally for my clients, I\u2019ve stuck with bitcoin miners but, more, I\u2019ve stuck with MicroStrategy,\u201d Ross said. \u201cI think [Saylor] does a great job with knowing when his shares are overpriced and distributing more shares to the market and then taking that cash and buying bitcoin. He knows\u2026when to take out debt at low rates in order to buy more bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy indicated in August it had entered into a sales agreement with Cowen and Company, Canaccord Genuity and Berenberg Capital Markets to sell up to $750 million of stock with one or more of those entities. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang said the firm could use the proceeds for \u201cgeneral corporate purposes,\u201d including to buy more bitcoin.\n\nVitanza and Navarrete said in the Jan. 16 research note they ultimately expect any future contraction in the company\u2019s premium over bitcoin to be offset by an increase in BTC\u2019s price.\n\nRead more: To gauge impact of bitcoin spot ETF, analysts look to gold\n\nSegment observers have said they expect bitcoin\u2019s price to increase as greater adoption for spot bitcoin ETFs coincides with the next bitcoin halving.\n\nThey added: \u201cA significant premium will continue to be justified, we believe, given MicroStrategy\u2019s lack of management fee, organic bitcoin accretion\u2026use of intelligent financial leverage and downside protection.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Bankman and Fried, both professors at Stanford Law School, argued that Bankman did not have a fiduciary relationship with FTX and did not serve \u201cas a director, officer, or manager,\u201d and even if a fiduciary relationship existed with FTX to plausibly allege a breach, according to a Jan 15. court filing."

        "title": "2024 Crypto Crime Trends from Chainalysis - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "2023 was a year of recovery for cryptocurrency, as the industry rebounded from the scandals, blowups, and price declines of 2022. With crypto assets rebounding and market activity growing over the course of 2023, many believe that crypto winter is ending, and a new growth phase may soon be upon us.\n\nBut what did all of that mean for crypto crime? Let\u2019s look at the high-level trends.\n\n2023 saw a significant drop in value received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses, to a total of $24.2 billion. As always, we have to caveat by saying that these figures are lower bound estimates based on inflows to the illicit addresses we\u2019ve identified today. One year from now, these totals will almost certainly be higher, as we identify more illicit addresses and incorporate their historic activity into our estimates. For instance, when we published our Crypto Crime Report last year, we estimated $20.6 billion worth of illicit transaction volume for 2022. One year later, our updated estimate for 2022 is $39.6 billion. Much of that growth came from the identification of previously unknown, highly active addresses hosted by sanctioned services, as well as our addition of transaction volume associated with services in sanctioned jurisdictions to our illicit totals.\n\nAnother key reason the new total is so much higher, besides the identification of new illicit addresses: We\u2019re now counting the $8.7 billion in creditor claims against FTX in our 2022 figures. In last year\u2019s report, we said that we would hold off on including transaction volumes associated with FTX and other firms that collapsed that year under allegedly fraudulent circumstances in our illicit totals until legal processes played out. Since then, a jury has convicted FTX\u2019s former CEO of fraud.\n\nTypically, we only include measurable on-chain activity in our estimates for illicit activity. In the case of FTX, it is impossible to use on-chain data alone to measure the scope of the fraudulent activity, as there\u2019s no way to isolate illegitimate movements of user funds. As such, we believe the $8.7 billion in creditor claims against FTX is the best estimate to include. Given the size and impact of the FTX situation, we are treating it as an exception to our usual on-chain methodology. If courts convict in similar, ongoing cases, we plan to include their activity in our illicit transaction data as well in the future.\n\nAll other totals exclude revenue from non-crypto native crime, such as conventional drug trafficking in which crypto is used as a means of payment. Such transactions are virtually indistinguishable from licit transactions in on-chain data. Of course, law enforcement with off-chain context can still investigate these flows using Chainalysis solutions. In cases where we\u2019re able to confirm such information, we count the transactions as illicit in our data, but there are almost certainly many instances where that isn\u2019t the case, and therefore the numbers wouldn\u2019t be reflected in our totals.\n\nIn addition to the reduction in absolute value of illicit activity, our estimate for the share of all crypto transaction volume associated with illicit activity also fell, to 0.34% from 0.42% in 2022. [1]\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing a shift in the types of assets involved in cryptocurrency-based crime.\n\nThrough 2021, Bitcoin reigned supreme as the cryptocurrency of choice among cybercriminals, likely due to its high liquidity. But that\u2019s changed over the last two years, with stablecoins now accounting for the majority of all illicit transaction volume. This change also comes alongside recent growth in stablecoins\u2019 share of all crypto activity overall, including legitimate activity. However, stablecoin dominance isn\u2019t the case for all forms of cryptocurrency-based crime.\n\nSome forms of illicit cryptocurrency activity, such as darknet market sales and ransomware extortion, still take place predominantly in Bitcoin. [2] Others, like scamming and transactions associated with sanctioned entities, have shifted to stablecoins. Those also happen to be the biggest forms of crypto crime by transaction volume, thereby driving the larger trend. Sanctioned entities, as well as those operating in sanctioned jurisdictions or involved with terrorism financing, also have a greater incentive to use stablecoins, as they may face more challenges accessing the U.S. dollar through traditional means, but still want to benefit from the stability it provides. However, stablecoin issuers can freeze funds when they become aware of their illicit use, as Tether recently did with addresses linked to terrorism and warfare in Israel and Ukraine.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll look at three key trends that defined crypto crime in 2023 and will be important to watch moving forward.\n\nScamming and Stolen Funds down big\n\nCrypto scamming and hacking revenue both fell significantly in 2023, with total illicit revenue for each down 29.2% and 54.3% respectively.\n\nAs we discuss later in our scams section, many crypto scammers have now adopted romance scam tactics, targeting individuals and building relationships with them in order to pitch them on fraudulent investing opportunities, rather than advertising them far and wide, which often makes them more difficult to uncover. Although the FBI has published data showing that reports of crypto investment scams in the U.S. has been increasing year over year through 2022, our on-chain metrics suggest scamming revenues globally have been trending down since 2021. We believe this aligns with the long-standing trend that scamming is most successful when markets are up, exuberance is high, and people feel like they are missing out on an opportunity to get rich quickly. Of course, the impact of romance scams on individual victims is devastating and should not be understated. And while increased reporting \u2013 at least in the U.S. \u2013 is a good sign, we still believe insights into romance scams in particular suffer from underreporting. We hypothesize that the true damage of scamming is greater than what reporting to the FBI and our on-chain metrics show, but overall, scamming is down, given broader market dynamics.\n\nCrypto hacking, on the other hand, is much more difficult for criminals to hide, as industry observers can quickly spot the unusual outflows from a given service or protocol when a hack occurs. As we\u2019ll discuss later, the decline in stolen funds is driven largely by a sharp dropoff in DeFi hacking. That dropoff could represent the reversal of a disturbing, long-term trend, and may signify that DeFi protocols are improving their security practices. That said, stolen funds metrics are heavily outlier-driven, and one large hack could again shift the trend.\n\nRansomware and darknet market activity on the rise\n\nRansomware and darknet markets, on the other hand, are two of the most prominent forms of crypto crime that saw revenues rise in 2023, in contrast with overall trends. The growth of ransomware revenue is disappointing following the sharp declines we covered last year, and suggests that perhaps ransomware attackers have adjusted to organizations\u2019 cybersecurity improvements, a trend we first reported earlier this year.\n\nSimilarly, this year\u2019s growth in darknet market revenue also comes after a 2022 decline in revenue. That decline was driven largely by the shutdown of Hydra, which was once the world\u2019s most dominant market by far, capturing over 90% of all darknet market revenue at its peak. While no single market has yet emerged to take its place, the sector as a whole is rebounding, with total revenue climbing back towards its 2021 highs.\n\nTransactions with sanctioned entities drive the vast majority of illicit activity\n\nPerhaps the most obvious trend that emerges when looking at illicit transaction volume is the prominence of sanctions-related transactions. Sanctioned entities and jurisdictions together accounted for a combined $14.9 billion worth of transaction volume in 2023, which represents 61.5% of all illicit transaction volume we measured on the year. Most of this total is driven by cryptocurrency services that were sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), or are located in sanctioned jurisdictions, and can continue to operate because they\u2019re in jurisdictions where U.S. sanctions are not enforced.\n\nWhile those services can and have been used for nefarious purposes, it also means that some of that $14.9 billion in sanctions-related transaction volume includes activity from average crypto users who happen to reside in those jurisdictions. For example, Russia-based exchange Garantex, which was sanctioned by OFAC and OFSI in the U.K. for its facilitation of money laundering on behalf of ransomware attackers and other cybercriminals, was one of the biggest drivers of transaction volume associated with sanctioned entities in 2023. Garantex continues to operate because Russia does not enforce U.S. sanctions. So, does that mean all of Garantex\u2019s transaction volume is associated with ransomware and money laundering? No. Nevertheless, exposure to Garantex introduces serious sanctions risk for crypto platforms subject to U.S. or U.K. jurisdiction, which means those platforms must remain ever-more vigilant and screen for exposure to Garantex in order to be compliant.\n\nMore crypto crime insights to come\n\nStay on the lookout for more research into cryptocurrency-based crime, as we continue to roll out insights on ransomware, hacking, crypto money laundering, and more.

        "title": "Spot bitcoin investment funds likely to stoke miners' massive energy use - Marketplace",
        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, so for the first time, people can invest in funds that include bitcoin with no crypto wallet required. A \u201cspot\u201d fund invests in the asset directly, as opposed to making bets on futures contracts.\n\nDemand for the original cryptocurrency is only expected to grow, and bitcoin mining operators are in position to satisfy it. Two years ago, Marketplace\u2019s Lily Jamali visited one in New York state. Stacks of computers burned through tons of power to generate new bitcoins, she reported.\n\nBen Hertz-Shargel of the consultancy Wood Mackenzie told Lily that the SEC\u2019s move will likely expand the miners\u2019 prodigious energy consumption. Texas is a hub for bitcoin mining, and among other effects, the increase could stress the state\u2019s already vulnerable power grid.\n\nThe following is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nBen Hertz-Shargel: It will send a long-term price signal to these miners to redouble their efforts and to build newer and bigger facilities. And Texas, like certain other states, is really in the crosshairs of multiple types of load growth, or energy demand growth, where they\u2019re dealing with not only growth from conventional data centers and crypto mines, but [electric vehicle] charging depots and manufacturing facilities. And so it\u2019s a challenge to deal with all of this increase in demand. Miners have already caused $1.8 billion per year in increased costs for consumers in Texas, and that was before these ETFs were approved. And this is going to really lock that in and potentially drive it up to extreme degrees.\n\nLily Jamali: So it\u2019s clear that demand for bitcoin, if anybody thought that was going away, that\u2019s not happening, at least not in the short term. I also visited a bitcoin mining facility in upstate New York in late 2021, early 2022. I was struck by something you wrote about, saying that in 2022, bitcoin mining consumed 60% as much power as it does today. Why does it cost so much more to generate a single bitcoin now?\n\nHertz-Shargel: Well, ultimately, demand for bitcoin has gone up. And there\u2019s an arms race that happens every day, where bitcoin miners who are operating ever larger data centers capture ever bigger pieces of the pie in terms of the revenue that bitcoin mining generates. And so that arms race has led to ever bigger facilities and more countries and greater investments. And so, yeah, the really scary statistic is that in 2022, mining consumed 20% as much electricity as global centralized data computing and data transmission put together. And the reason that is a staggering statistic is those two latter types of energy demand, data computing and data transmission, are really the fruits of the internet, the cloud and now the sort of budding [artificial intelligence] industrial revolution put together. So the question is, you have to evaluate: Is the value that bitcoin provides, essentially being a store of value like gold, worth one-fifth as much of the value that all of those other forms of energy demand are providing?\n\nJamali: Texas is the only state in the country, we should mention, with its own grid. Have I got that right?\n\nHertz-Shargel: Other states have their own grid operator. But yes, Texas is self-contained in an electrical way that no other state is.\n\nJamali: Yeah, and so it\u2019s especially vulnerable. And I asked that because we\u2019re approaching the third anniversary of the winter storm that left a lot of people without power. It ended up killing 250 people. And just this week, the state went through a winter freeze. So help us understand how much pressure in moments like this do bitcoin miners place on the grid?\n\nHertz-Shargel: I think there is a miners\u2019 claim, and I think there is popular belief, that they stop operating when the grid is stressed, when energy prices are high. In reality, a lot of miners, we\u2019ve seen firsthand, continue to operate even in these kind of stressed conditions when prices are really high. This not only raises the price in an extreme way for consumers after the fact, but it does risk the grid operator getting closer and closer to that point where it needs to consider brownouts. So, the reality is these miners are stretching the grid basically 24/7. And in some cases, they do turn off in extreme cases, but not all of them do. And so it just pushes the grid closer to that point you don\u2019t want to be where you\u2019re running the risk of having to turn the lights out on people.\n\nJamali: And I know as of not that long ago, bitcoin miners in Texas, specifically, were getting paid, or compensated, if they put power back on the grid during these extreme weather events. Is that still the case?\n\nHertz-Shargel: It is still the case. And what that does is it shifts the cost of the year\u2019s grid investment, which is only growing more significant every year, back on to other customers. And I think it\u2019s also worth pointing out that the big tech companies are the largest buyers of clean energy in the United States. Whereas bitcoin miners, what they do is they have begun to site their facilities near renewable facilities like a wind farm or solar farm. But all that does is, you\u2019re still drawing the same unit of power that some other customer would have benefited from from that facility. They\u2019re not meaningfully offsetting their demand.\n\nJamali: This is interesting because this is an argument that the bitcoin miners have made \u2014 the fact that they now are starting to set up shop next to those existing renewables projects. They say, \u201cLook, we\u2019re helping. We\u2019re not making things worse.\u201d\n\nHertz-Shargel: That\u2019s right. But it\u2019s very intuitive to understand that if you park a facility right next to, let\u2019s say, a solar farm and start consuming the electrons from that facility, those electrons would have gone to some other customer in Texas. So all you\u2019re doing as the one who happens to consume them, at the end of the day overall demand on the grid goes up. And that means that the grid operator needs to dispatch ever more costly and carbon-intensive generators to meet that increased demand that you caused. And so there is no sustainability benefit, which is very much unlike what the big tech companies are doing by actually causing new renewable facilities to be built. So those facilities meaningfully do offset the emissions associated with their, their demand.\n\nJamali: Are there any indications that regulation might help cap some of this activity?\n\nHertz-Shargel: Well, I mean, I think what we\u2019ve seen around the country is that most states are more concerned to protect bitcoin mining rather than constrain it. They usually introduce legislation that prevents a state from \u201cdiscriminating\u201d against the type of data center or facility based on its purpose. I do think Texas, there has been some backlash because of the awareness [that] these are massive energy loads that you can compare them to the size of cities or other sort of extraordinary types of demand sources. And so I do think that there was this notion that they want to limit how much they\u2019re willing to pay them to curtail. I do think it\u2019s important to identify when they say they\u2019re putting power back on the grid, what that means is they have usually contracted for power from a generator, and they simply choose to withhold consuming that power, and they allow their provider to liquidate the power to sell it to the grid. So they\u2019re just making available something that would have been available anyway if they didn\u2019t exist.\n\nMore on this\n\nHere\u2019s Lily\u2019s story from her visit to that bitcoin mining operation she mentioned. Her reporting focused on what locals in Massena, New York, thought about the arrival of bitcoin mining in their struggling regional economy. One resident called crypto \u201ctechno-wizard bullshit.\u201d\n\nA few months into 2022, the state of New York placed a partial moratorium on what\u2019s known as proof of work mining, citing the environmental impacts. Before that, Plattsburgh, New York, became the first municipality in the country to ban the practice after undergoing what former Mayor Colin Read called a \u201ccrypto mining arms race\u201d in the MIT Technology Review. Read happens to be an economics professor and has written a book, \u201cThe Bitcoin Dilemma,\u201d about the financial and environmental costs of this activity.\n\nSomething else Ben Hertz-Shargel mentioned in our interview is that New York is an exception. Many states are eager for the business. Here\u2019s a tracker that looks at the amount of energy consumed by specific bitcoin mining companies in Texas, where the growth has been explosive."

        "content": "Welcome back to \" Ask an Advisor ,\" the advice column where real financial professionals answer questions from real people. The topic can be anything in the world of finance, from retirement to taxes to wealth management \u2014 or even advice on advising.\n\nLast week, after years of resistance, the SEC approved the spot bitcoin ETF . Specifically, it approved 11 versions of the new exchange-traded fund, offered by brands including Grayscale, Fidelity and iShares.\n\nWhat makes this product unusual is what's inside it: actual bitcoin. Unlike derivatives-based bitcoin ETFs, which are based on bitcoin futures contracts, the spot bitcoin ETF's underlying asset is bitcoin itself. This means more direct tracking of the cryptocurrency's price, but also more exposure to its volatility.\n\nThough the SEC approved the new funds, its decision was far from a full-throated endorsement. The commission has long been skeptical of the spot bitcoin ETF, and in fact rejected more than 20 applications for this kind of product from 2018 to 2023. It relented only after the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. ruled against one of those decisions.\n\nSo when SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced the SEC's final decision, he did so with obvious reluctance.\n\n\"While we approved the listing and trading of certain spot bitcoin ETP [exchange-traded product] shares today, we did not approve or endorse bitcoin,\" Gensler wrote. \"Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto.\"\n\nREAD MORE: What financial advisors need to know about SEC-approved spot bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe chairman went on to describe bitcoin as a \"speculative, volatile asset that's also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion and terrorist financing.\"\n\nSo to put it mildly, there are some asterisks on this approval. And yet, it's here: The spot bitcoin ETF is now available to investors. Can it be a good investment? Will financial advisors recommend it to clients? To find out, I asked the advisors themselves. Here's what I wrote:\n\nDear advisors,\n\nLast week, after years of resistance, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs. In approving the ETFs, Chair Gary Gensler pointedly did not endorse bitcoin in general, and cautioned investors once again about the risks of crypto.\n\nSo my question is, is a spot bitcoin ETF safer than bitcoin itself? Would you recommend any of these products to clients? If so, to whom? What role could these ETFs play in a portfolio \u2014 or do you prefer to stay away from them all together?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nWary in Washington Heights\n\nAnd here's what advisors wrote back:"

        "content": "CNBC's Jim Cramer on Wednesday explained what the Securities and Exchange Committee's decision to approve spot bitcoin exchange-traded products in the U.S. means for investors.\n\nCramer said he's not necessarily against investing in Bitcoin, but warned investors to know the risks before buying.\n\n\"I'm taking a page from Jamie Dimon here \u2014 this is a caveat emptor situation,\" he said, referring to the JPMorgan CEO and Bitcoin skeptic. \"You can make up your own mind about what to do with these spot Bitcoin ETPs, I just want to make sure you know what, exactly, you might be putting your money in and how little went into these funds versus how much Bitcoin went up.\"\n\nETPs include several investment vehicles, such as exchange-traded funds and exchange-traded notes. The SEC's move will give regular investors more access to cryptocurrency \u2014 a notoriously erratic asset \u2014 and may help to carve out its place in mainstream finance.\n\nCramer stressed that the SEC's approval does not mean the organization endorses these products. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has spoken out against crypto in the past and the agency disapproved more than 20 filings for spot Bitcoin ETPs from 2018-2023.\n\n\"Now, that said, I'm not as stridently against these new investment vehicles as Gary Gensler is,\" Cramer said. \"At this point, Bitcoin's been around for 15 years, it's fairly well-established, and I don't want to try to stop anyone from speculating in this stuff, as long as they do their research. Of course, I'm not totally sure what your research would be, but that's not my problem.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin to $100,000 or Shiba Inu to $0.01: What's More Likely to Happen in 2024? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -7.01%) has risen by around 60% in just the past three months. Hype and excitement ahead of the approval of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has resulted in investors becoming incredibly bullish on crypto of late. At more than $40,000, the digital currency is now trading around the levels it was at two years ago. There's hope that it could hit the $100,000 mark.\n\nAnother popular coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB -10.56%) also has the potential to rise given the overall excitement around crypto these days. In the past, it has been a popular meme coin, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has often tweeted about it. Shiba Inu has been rising in value recently, and given its low token price -- around $0.0000096 on Tuesday -- getting to $0.01 would be a massive return for investors.\n\nWhich scenario looks more probable for 2024: Bitcoin getting to $100,000, or Shiba Inu rising to a value of $0.01?\n\nBitcoin has been falling but there's another catalyst that could be coming\n\nIn what could just be the latest example of investors and speculators buying the rumor and selling the news, Bitcoin's value has been falling in the wake of the Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs. On Jan. 10, the regulator approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, but the value of the digital currency dipped to less than $42,000 by Jan. 13. Bitcoin has rallied since then but it definitely doesn't look to be skyrocketing on the news.\n\nOver time, however, the momentum may build back up if the approval of the ETF has the desired effect -- getting a significantly larger number of more risk-averse investors and crypto novices to put Bitcoin into their portfolios. That's not something that investors should expect to happen overnight.\n\nThere's another catalyst that could help Bitcoin's value rise even further. Every four years or so, the rewards for validating each block of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain (i.e., mining) are cut in half. These \"halving\" events, which are built into the Bitcoin protocol, reduce the rate of token supply growth. The next halving is expected to take place in April.\n\nPrior halvings have been followed by surges in Bitcoin's price. Combine that with the possibility of more investors buying crypto due to spot Bitcoin ETFs now being available, and there could be an even stronger rally this time around.\n\nIs Shiba Inu getting to $0.01 too big of a dream?\n\nShiba Inu isn't nearly as popular as Bitcoin is, but as investors learned a few years ago, everyone loves a good underdog. And with the help of meme investors, Shiba Inu has the potential to rally as more people learn about crypto. While the spot Bitcoin ETFs could make it easier for some people to invest in Bitcoin, they may also lead them to get more interested in other cryptocurrencies.\n\nGrowth investors looking for the next big opportunity may be concerned that Bitcoin, which has a market cap of $840 billion, may simply be too expensive. A smaller coin such as Shiba Inu, which has the potential to captivate meme investors, could be seen as possessing more potential upside. At around $5.7 billion, its market cap is much smaller than Bitcoin's.\n\nThe big question, however, is whether $0.01 is simply too high of a target for the coin to reach. For it to get to $0.01, Shibu Inu's price would need to grow by about 1,100 times. By comparison, Bitcoin would need to grow by 2.5 times to get to $100,000. And if Shiba Inu achieved such a gain, its market cap would be $5.9 trillion, giving it a higher market cap than Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin getting to $100,000 is much more probable\n\nBitcoin is already the larger and more popular coin, and there are no compelling reasons to believe Shiba Inu could skyrocket past it. It might go along for the ride with other cryptocurrencies as they increase in value, but it's highly unlikely that Shiba Inu will lead the charge.\n\nThere are now thousands of cryptocurrencies to choose from and the benefit Bitcoin has is that it has become synonymous with crypto and it's the most popular coin. If someone is going to invest in crypto, it'll likely be with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin may not reach $100,000 this year, but that outcome is much more probable than Shiba Inu getting anywhere near $0.01. Crypto remains risky, but Bitcoin is the safest option compared to all other coins."

        "title": "Despite SEC's novel alignment on bitcoin ETF vote, it's regulatory politics as usual - InvestmentNews",
        "content": "A recent SEC vote to approve a spot bitcoin ETF was both typical \u2013 in that the agency split, 3-2, on a controversial decision, and extraordinary \u2013 in that the three \u201cyeas\u201d consisted of SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the two Republican commissioners.\n\nBut rather than representing a tectonic shift in the politics of regulation, the alignment of the five-member SEC on the bitcoin decision signals that the stark divisions that have characterized major rulemaking under Gensler will continue as the Securities and Exchange Commission wrestles with explosive pending regulations. That effort will unfold, however, with the looming threat of lawsuits by opponents and court decisions like the one that drove the bitcoin ETF outcome.\n\nSEC proposals on financial advisors\u2019 conflicts related to artificial intelligence and predictive data analytics, advisor custody of client funds, swing pricing for mutual funds and climate disclosure are among major pending regulations that have drawn widespread resistance.\n\nUsually, opponents of SEC proposals can find allies in the two SEC Republican commissioners, Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda. In the 3-2 votes cast so far on proposals and final rules, it\u2019s been Gensler and the two Democratic commissioners, Caroline Crenshaw and Jaime Lizarraga, as \u201cyeas\u201d and Peirce and Uyeda as \u201cnays.\u201d\n\nThe bitcoin vote was different. For the first time in his nearly three-year tenure, Gensler sided with the two Republicans to approve 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. The alignment was startling but not a harbinger of Gensler\u2019s shifting to the right in oversight.\n\n\u201cThis vote is not going to usher in a new era of strange alliances on votes on rulemakings or other applications to list and trade products,\u201d said Kurt Wolfe, counsel at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.\n\nGensler\u2019s statement seems to indicate that he was at best reluctant \u2013 perhaps dragged kicking and screaming \u2013 to cast his vote in favor of the bitcoin ETF. He felt constrained by a Washington, D.C., federal appeals court ruling that the SEC had failed to explain its reasoning adequately in a prior rejection of a Grayscale bitcoin ETF.\n\n\u201cI feel the most sustainable path forward is to approve the listing and trading of these spot bitcoin ETP shares,\u201d Gensler said in a statement. He went on to say that the SEC\u2019s approval comes with several investor protections and reiterated the risks associated with crypto assets, a view shared by many financial advisors.\n\n\u201cMaybe it was better to capitulate now than to wage a losing war,\u201d Wolfe said.\n\nWill the threat of legal challenges affect rulemaking on some of the major controversial potential final rules ahead? It\u2019s hard to say for certain. What we can see is that Gensler\u2019s ambitious regulatory agenda hasn\u2019t changed in any significant way despite growing pressure from financial industry detractors who are poised to file lawsuits against final rules.\n\nIn addition to the stability of Gensler\u2019s agenda, there has been a lack of exemptive orders or no-action letters that signal a significant shift in the SEC\u2019s direction on significant policy matters.\n\n\u201cAll signs indicate it will be business as usual,\u201d said Val Dahiya, a partner at Morrison Foerster and a former branch chief for the SEC\u2019s division of trading and markets. Gensler \u201cis proceeding with his vision. They\u2019re going to let this play out in the courts.\u201d\n\nAs Grayscale\u2019s successful challenge of the SEC\u2019s previous disapproval of a bitcoin ETF illustrates, courts could be inclined to side with the SEC\u2019s industry opponents.\n\n\u201cThe theoretical check and balance seems to be becoming a more practical check and balance on the authority of the SEC,\u201d said Brian McCabe, partner at Ropes & Gray. \u201cI suspect the Democratic commissioners are going to be a little more cautious about making sure they have built the best record in support of the conclusions they reach\u201d on rulemakings.\n\nInvestor protection advocates question whether Gensler needed to abandon his opposition to a bitcoin ETF. They suggest that there was a path for him to continue the SEC\u2019s ban on the products, as Crenshaw and Lizarraga voted to do.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the agency may have blinked in the face of a legal threat,\u201d said Mark Hays, senior policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform. \u201cWe believe they still had options. The agency always has to decide which hills are worth dying on when it come to their legal strategy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the atmosphere that will surround Gensler and his colleagues in the coming months as they shape many controversial proposals into final rules. He\u2019s a savvy regulator who knows how to navigate political and legal minefields.\n\n\u201cYou have to look hard at the rules and determine if there\u2019s a version of the proposal that either will not get challenged or if challenged will survive,\u201d Wolfe said.\n\nGensler was forced into a position he didn\u2019t like on the bitcoin ETF. He\u2019ll likely figure out how to land in a place where he\u2019s more comfortable next time."

The regulator approved the ETFs from Ark Invest and 21 Shares, Bitwise, BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Hashdex, Invesco, Valkyrie, VanEck and WisdomTree.\n\nBut Vanguard wants no part of the spot bitcoin ETF hype, for now.\n\n\u201cWhile we continuously evaluate our brokerage offer and evaluate new product entries to the market, spot bitcoin ETFs will not be available for purchase on the Vanguard platform,\u201d Vanguard said.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group.\n\nThe company also doesn\u2019t plan to offer Vanguard bitcoin ETFs or other cryptocurrency-related products.\n\n\u201cOur perspective is that these products do not align with our offer focused on asset classes, such as equities, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio,\u201d the company said.\n\nVanguard\u2019s decision to shun spot bitcoin ETFs \u201cis very much on brand for Vanguard,\u201d Jeff DeMaso, editor of The Independent Vanguard Advisor, wrote to his readers.\n\n\u201cThe firm has long tried to \u2018look out\u2019 for smaller investors,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cFor example, the firm kicked leveraged ETFs off its platform several years ago.

        "content": "YBTC is the first U.S. ETF to implement a covered call strategy on bitcoin*, allowing investors to participate in upside exposure to bitcoin* while potentially generating monthly options income.\n\nNEW YORK, Jan. 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Roundhill Investments, an ETF sponsor focused on innovative financial products, is pleased to announce the launch of the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF (YBTC), which begins trading on Cboe BZX today. YBTC is the first bitcoin covered call strategy ETF to list in the U.S.\n\nYBTC seeks to offer investors exposure to bitcoin*, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The Fund employs a covered call strategy on bitcoin ETFs, designed to generate monthly income while providing investors with exposure to the price movements of bitcoin (subject to an upside cap). Historically, bitcoin has exhibited significant volatility, which may allow for the Fund to generate significant options income from its call selling strategy. In turn, the Fund seeks to provide current income to shareholders.\n\nSimilar to gold, bitcoin stands out as an asset that does not yield operating profits or cash flows, presenting a unique challenge for income-focused investors. Traditionally, this gap has led to the popularity of on-chain strategies such as staking for crypto assets like Ether. Meanwhile, YBTC overlays a covered call strategy on bitcoin to allow for investors to retain upside to bitcoin while addressing needs for current income.\n\n\"YBTC offers investors an attractive blend of high income potential and exposure to bitcoin,\" said Dave Mazza, Chief Strategy Officer at Roundhill Investments. \"Investors have clamored for a covered call ETF with exposure to bitcoin and we are proud to be the first to bring such a product to the U.S. market.\"\n\nYBTC seeks to pay distributions, if any, on a monthly basis.\n\n* The fund does not invest in bitcoin directly; it seeks to provide exposure to the price return of an exchange-traded fund that invests principally in bitcoin futures contracts (the \"Bitcoin Futures ETF\"). The fund is not suitable for all investors and involves a high degree of risk.\n\nAbout Roundhill Investments:\n\nRoundhill Investments is a registered investment adviser focused on offering innovative financial products designed to offer exposure to investment themes that appeal to the next generation of investors. To learn more about the company, please visit roundhillinvestments.com.\n\nInvestors should consider the investment objectives, risk, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the ETF please call 1-877-220-7649 or visit the website at https:// www.roundhillinvestments.com/etf/ . Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing.\n\nAll investing involves risk, including the risk of loss of principal. There is no guarantee the investment strategy will be successful. The fund faces numerous risks, including options risk, liquidity risk, market risk, cost of futures investment risk, clearing broker risk, commodity regulatory risk, futures contract risk, active management risk, active market risk, clearing broker risk, credit risk, derivatives risk, legislation and litigation risk, operational risk, trading issues risk, valuation risk and non-diversification risk. For a detailed list of fund risks see the prospectus.\n\nCovered Call Strategy Risk. A covered call strategy involves writing (selling) covered call options in return for the receipt of premiums. The seller of the option gives up the opportunity to benefit from price increases in the underlying instrument above the exercise price of the options, but continues to bear the risk of underlying instrument price declines. The premiums received from the options may not be sufficient to offset any losses sustained from underlying instrument price declines, over time. As a result, the risks associated with writing covered call options may be similar to the risks associated with writing put options. Exchanges may suspend the trading of options during periods of abnormal market volatility. Suspension of trading may mean that an option seller is unable to sell options at a time that may be desirable or advantageous to do. Bitcoin Futures ETF Risks. The Fund will have significant exposure to the Bitcoin Futures ETF through its options positions that utilize the Bitcoin Futures ETF as the reference asset. Accordingly, the Fund will subject to the risks of the Bitcoin Futures ETF, set forth below. Bitcoin Risk. Bitcoin is a relatively new innovation and the market for bitcoin is subject to rapid price swings, changes and uncertainty. The further development of the Bitcoin network and the acceptance and use of bitcoin are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing, stopping or reversing of the development of the Bitcoin network or the acceptance of bitcoin may adversely affect the price of bitcoin. Bitcoin is subject to the risk of fraud, theft, manipulation or security failures, operational or other problems that impact the digital asset trading venues on which bitcoin trades. The Bitcoin blockchain may contain flaws that can be exploited by hackers. A significant portion of bitcoin is held by a small number of holders sometimes referred to as \"whales.\" Transactions of these holders may influence the price of bitcoin. Digital Asset Industry Risk. The digital asset industry is a new, speculative, and still-developing industry that faces many risks. In this emerging environment, events that are not directly related to the security or utility of the Ethereum blockchain or the Bitcoin blockchain can nonetheless precipitate a significant decline in the price of ether and bitcoin. Digital Asset Regulatory Risk. Digital asset markets in the U.S. exist in a state of regulatory uncertainty, and adverse legislative or regulatory developments could significantly harm the value of bitcoin futures contracts or the Bitcoin Futures ETF's share, such as by banning, restricting or imposing onerous conditions or prohibitions on the use of bitcoin, mining activity, digital wallets, the provision of services related to trading and custodying digital assets, the operation of the Bitcoin network, or the digital asset markets generally. Such occurrences could also impair the Bitcoin Futures ETF's ability to meet its investment objective pursuant to its investment strategy. Flex Options Risk. The Fund will utilize FLEX Options issued and guaranteed for settlement by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). In the unlikely event that the OCC becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its settlement obligations, the Fund could suffer significant losses. Additionally, FLEX Options may be less liquid than standard options. In a less liquid market for the FLEX Options, the Fund may have difficulty closing out certain FLEX Options positions at desired times and prices. The values of FLEX Options do not increase or decrease at the same rate as the reference asset and may vary due to factors other than the price of reference asset. New Fund Risk. The fund is new and has a limited operating history.\n\nRoundhill Financial Inc. serves as the investment advisor. The Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC which is not affiliated with Roundhill Financial Inc., U.S. Bank, or any of their affiliates.\n\nGlossary\n\nOptions\n\nAn option is a contract sold by one party to another that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a stock at an agreed upon price within a certain period or on a specific date.\n\nCovered Call Strategy\n\nA covered call strategy involves writing (selling) covered call options in return for the receipt of premiums. The seller of the option gives up the opportunity to benefit from price increases in the underlying instrument above the exercise price of the options, but continues to bear the risk of underlying instrument price declines.\n\nSOURCE Roundhill Investments"

So they basically made this a component of their portfolio.\"\n\nTrading volume\n\nWhile BlackRock\u2019s new ETF is generating more volume on Robinhood, in the broader market, Grayscale has seen the most activity among spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds currently trading. A large portion of Grayscale\u2019s volume has been generated by outflows, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nThe firm\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF is a conversion of its flagship GBTC fund and charges a higher fee than some of its competitors. It's also much larger in terms of assets under management, and investors who had wanted to sell before the ETF conversion faced a hefty discount.\n\nGrayscale didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nSo far, more than 90% of all spot bitcoin ETF trading is going through the top three funds by volume, which are offered by Grayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity. Into their fifth day of trading, the cumulative trading total of all spot bitcoin ETFs was $12.7 billion as of 12:47 p.m. ET.\n\n'Top 20' investment\n\nQuirk, who is bullish about spot bitcoin ETFs, said he is pleased with how popular the new bitcoin-based instruments have been among Robinhood users.\n\n\"If we look at the overall volume in our world, these [ETFs] have worked their way up to the top 20\" most popular investments on the platform,\" he said.\n\nLast week, Robinhood announced it would list all 11 spot bitcoin ETFs on its trading platform.\n\n\"We believe crypto is the financial framework of the future and that increased access to bitcoin via ETFs is a good thing for the industry,\" Johann Kerbrat, general manager of Robinhood Crypto, said at the time.\n\nRobinhood currently has 23 million users."

        "content": "With Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals looming during an election year, a key debate centers around which U.S. administration is more favorable for Bitcoin adoption: Trump's or Biden's. While the Biden era has seen its share of developments, it's Donald Trump\u2019s presidency that edges out as being slightly more advantageous for Bitcoin\u2019s growth \u2014 at least so far. Take a look at both administrations' stances on Bitcoin and see who is more favorable for Bitcoin adoption.\n\nTrump's tenure was marked by a notable laissez-faire approach to cryptocurrency regulation. This hands-off strategy proved to be a significant catalyst for Bitcoin, and more generally, the markets. The lack of stringent regulations under Trump\u2019s administration allowed for greater expansion within the crypto space, fostering an environment where Bitcoin and blockchain projects could thrive relatively unimpeded.\n\nTrump's economic policies, including tax cuts and deregulation, also contributed to a favorable investment climate, which indirectly benefited Bitcoin. The bullish stock market and a strong appetite for alternative investments during his presidency also spilled over into increased investment in the cryptocurrency arena.\n\nIn contrast, President Joe Biden's administration signals a shift toward a more regulated cryptocurrency environment. While regulation is essential for long-term stability and legitimacy, there's concern that excessive oversight could dampen the innovative spirit of the crypto world. Biden\u2019s focus on regulatory clarity, while beneficial in some aspects, might slow down the growth that Bitcoin experienced during Trump\u2019s era.\n\nUnder Biden, Bitcoin also continues to face challenges in terms of mainstream acceptance and integration into the traditional financial system. While there is progress, the main event people are now watching is spot Bitcoin ETF approvals.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nWhen weighing both administrations, Trump\u2019s presidency seems to have a slight edge in terms of fostering a more conducive environment for Bitcoin adoption. His administration's relaxed regulatory stance played a key role in allowing the crypto market, especially Bitcoin, to flourish in 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s presidency brings advantages to the Bitcoin ecosystem, it's Trump's administration that provided a more favorable backdrop for Bitcoin\u2019s adoption. This slight bias toward Trump\u2019s era doesn\u2019t discount the ongoing developments under Biden but highlights the impact of regulatory approaches on the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Trump Vs.

        "content": "ETF capture of asset classes expanded notably last week with the launch of 10 spot bitcoin ETFs. Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, discussed the launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with BlackRock\u2019s Jay Jacobs. Rosenbluth and Jacobs also talked about the benefits of ETF bitcoin exposure for investors, and about blockchain technology at the Crypto Symposium hosted on the VettaFi platform.\n\n\u201cThis is a culmination of a multiyear journey to bring out a bitcoin ETF,\u201d Jay Jacobs, U.S. head of thematics and Active Equity ETFs at BlackRock, explained. \u201cThis was really driven by the investors themselves.\u201d\n\nThreefold Benefit of Spot Bitcoin ETFs for Investors\n\nETFs remain a popular vehicle with investors. Demand continues to grow for more asset classes offered in an ETF wrapper. The approval by the SEC and subsequent launch of spot bitcoin ETFs provide investors with a number of benefits.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) allows investors to gain access to bitcoin through their traditional brokerages. \u201cThe ability to see bitcoin alongside traditional investments like stocks and bonds is a key piece of why an ETF provides value to investors,\u201d said Jacobs.\n\nAs well as ease of access, spot bitcoin ETFs provide convenience for investors. Cryptocurrency is an asset class that requires custodians, storage, and additional tax considerations when invested in directly. An ETF helps remove much of the legwork and complexities from bitcoin investing.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s really about quality,\u201d Jacobs explained of the launch of IBIT. \u201cIt\u2019s about looking at what BlackRock has done across 1,300 ETFs globally and trillions of dollars in assets over the last 20 years and really applying that quality to a bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nHe went on to discuss the increased need for granularity by investors in an environment of ongoing risk and uncertainty. The addition of bitcoin ETFs gives investors even more choice, particularly when increasingly more portfolios look beyond traditional asset classes.\n\nOpportunity to Invest in Blockchain\u2019s Nascent Potential\n\nBlackRock also offers the iShares Blockchain and Tech (IBLC) that launched in April 2022. Blockchain is a decentralized ledger maintained in a peer-to-peer network.\n\n\u201cHistorically, a lot of data entry has been centralized and when it is centralized, that means it is controlled by one or only a few people,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThat can be really powerful for doing things quickly. But that\u2019s not necessarily very powerful for doing things in a secure way, or an immutable way.\u201d\n\nBecause blockchain is decentralized, it provides security and an immutability that centralized systems cannot. Jacobs still considers blockchain technology to be in the nascent stage of development, but with much promise. As increasingly more companies begin to adopt the technology, and its use case is better defined, broad uptake will likely follow."

This makes it the first among the recently launched Bitcoin ETFs to reach this milestone.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust started trading on January 12, 2024, and has quickly gained traction among investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated and transparent investment vehicle. IBIT's holdings consist primarily of Bitcoin, with 99% of its portfolio allocated to the cryptocurrency. The fund also holds a small amount of fiat currency, currently valued at nearly $60,000. As of Thursday, the fund held 25,067 Bitcoin.\n\nRobert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, said: \"We are excited to see IBIT reach this milestone in its first week, reflecting strong investor demand. This is just the beginning. We have a long-term commitment focused on providing investors access to an iShares quality ETF.\"\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust closed Wednesday's trading session at $24.41 and trades at a slight premium of 0.42% relative to the spot price of Bitcoin.

The actively managed YBTC is the first bitcoin covered call strategy ETF to list in the U.S.\n\nWhile the fund seeks to offer investors exposure to bitcoin, it does not invest in bitcoin directly. Rather, it aims to provide exposure to the price return of an ETF that invests principally in bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nYBTC employs a covered call strategy on bitcoin ETFs. It\u2019s designed to generate monthly income while providing exposure to bitcoin\u2019s price movements (subject to an upside cap).\n\n\u201cCovered calls were the ETF trend of 2023 as advisors sought alternative income strategies,\u201d said VettaFi\u2019s Head of Research Todd Rosenbluth. \u201cWith spot bitcoin ETFs now trading and likely to remain volatile, this new ETF could find an audience in a crowded cryptomarket.\u201d\n\nSee more: \u201cSpot Bitcoin ETFs Finally Arrive\u201d\n\nRetaining Upside While Providing Income\n\nSince bitcoin has been historically volatile, Roundhill\u2019s new ETF could generate significant options income from its call-selling strategy. In turn, YBTC seeks to provide current income to shareholders.\n\nSimilar to gold, bitcoin doesn\u2019t yield operating profits or cash flows. This presents a challenge for investors focused on income. Traditionally, this gap has led to the popularity of on-chain strategies such as staking for crypto assets like ether. Meanwhile, YBTC overlays a covered call strategy on bitcoin to let investors retain upside to bitcoin while addressing current income needs.\n\n\u201cYBTC offers investors an attractive blend of high income potential and exposure to bitcoin,\u201d said Dave Mazza, chief strategy officer at Roundhill Investments. \u201cInvestors have clamored for a covered call ETF with exposure to bitcoin and we are proud to be the first to bring such a product to the U.S. market.\u201d\n\nThe fund seeks to pay any distributions on a monthly basis. It charges 95 basis points.\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF Rush\n\nThe launch of YBTC follows the SEC giving the green light for multiple spot bitcoin ETFs. After a great deal of hype and speculation, the SEC on January 10 approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs to come to market.\n\nAmong the spot bitcoin ETFs that launched last week were the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL), the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust (BITB), and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC). Fidelity, WisdomTree, and BlackRock were also among the issuers that launched such funds."

        "title": "SEC Approval Was Huge for Bitcoin ETFs. But the World's Biggest Just Got a Far More Important Win. - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "After plunging in 2022, Bitcoin (BTC -6.80%) got its mojo back, more than doubling in 2023. The end of the crypto winter came in large part because of anticipation that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might finally grant approval to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) seeking to own Bitcoin directly.\n\nIndeed, that optimistic scenario came to pass earlier this month. The SEC approved 11 different spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10, opening the door to a flood of new interest from investors who were wary about investing directly in the cryptocurrency themselves.\n\nThat was particularly important for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC -5.76%). The Grayscale Bitcoin investment vehicle had been in place for years as an unregistered fund for accredited and institutional investors through private placements.\n\nWith the SEC's move, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust became a true ETF. And as it happens, what is now the world's largest Bitcoin ETF has scored an even bigger win simply by virtue of its having retained its leadership status amid a flood of new rivals. Here's why.\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\n\nPrior to becoming an ETF, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust had operated for more than a decade. Its shares were listed on the over-the-counter market, and it had offered shares directly to those investors who were eligible to make purchases without Grayscale having to register its shares as securities with the SEC. After a holding period, initial purchasers could turn around and sell their shares over the counter to whoever wanted to buy them.\n\nThere were a couple of problems with Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, however. First, it carried a high expense ratio of 2% per year. Even worse, Grayscale didn't offer any redemption rights, so unlike with an ETF, even large institutional shareholders had no ability to exchange shares for the Bitcoin that the trust held.\n\nAs a consequence, shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust plunged far below the value of the underlying Bitcoin that the fund owned. Lacking a redemption mechanism, there was no way for arbitrage-minded investors to capitalize on the disparity in the short run.\n\nIndeed, when Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's discounts to net asset value were at their highest, many investors believed that the crypto investment vehicle could suffer significant outflows if the SEC approved its ETF conversion.\n\nMoreover, with alternatives offering Bitcoin exposure at much lower expense ratios -- despite a post-conversion cut from 2% to 1.5% -- it seemed that Grayscale might lose its crypto dominance. Instead, the discount disappeared, giving extra returns to those who invested in the Grayscale vehicle when discounts were at their highest.\n\nGrayscale is holding its own\n\nAs a result, at least in its early days, no exodus from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF has happened. The ETF reported 690 million shares outstanding as of Jan. 12, with a total value of $26.9 billion and each share representing roughly 0.000894 underlying Bitcoin. That's consistent with where asset levels were prior to the SEC approval.\n\nDeeper analysis suggests relatively small movements of actual Bitcoin from the Grayscale ETF. One report from Arkham Intelligence noted a movement of nearly 900 Bitcoin on Jan. 12, worth roughly $41 million. Even if that represented redemptions, though, it was inconsequential compared to the size of the fund.\n\nWill Grayscale lose its leadership?\n\nFor cost-conscious investors, Grayscale has a disadvantage. Every single one of its 10 competitors offers a lower expense ratio. Early favorite iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT -5.82%) charges just 0.25% per year in fees.\n\nThat could eventually spur investors to move their assets away from Grayscale. Yet for those who have invested in Bitcoin long enough to have sizable gains, the capital-gains tax liability that would come from switching from Grayscale to a rival Bitcoin ETF would be a deterrent.\n\nAt least in the opening days, Grayscale has done well to hold on to its assets. But investors shouldn't be surprised if that story changes in the months to come -- particularly as other Bitcoin ETFs show their ability to track the value of the cryptocurrency."

        "content": "South Korea\u2019s Office of the President has urged the financial regulator to reconsider the possibility of approving a local spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), an official of the presidential office said.\n\nSung Tae-yoon, the chief of staff for policy of the presidential office, said in a briefing on Thursday that the South Korean government is exploring ways to incorporate foreign affairs into local regulations \u2014 which may indicate the country\u2019s openness to launching spot crypto ETFs, local news outlet Maeil Business reported Friday.\n\nThe presidential office\u2019s comment comes after the Financial Services Commission last week warned local firms that brokering foreign-listed bitcoin spot ETFs might be interpreted as a violation of capital market regulations. Following the announcement, several major local securities companies suspended trading of existing foreign spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nElsewhere in Asia\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nWhile South Korea\u2019s government holds a somewhat divided opinion on the possibility of a local spot bitcoin ETF, Singapore and Thailand have said it\u2019s not something they\u2019re considering. The Monetary Authority of Singapore told CNA earlier this week that spot bitcoin ETFs are not granted for offering to local retail investors. Thailand\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission also said this week that it does not plan to approve local firms to launch such ETFs, as reported by the Bangkok Post.\n\nRegional experts have said that Hong Kong could be the next hub in Asia to introduce a local spot crypto ETF, with its financial regulators publishing two circulars in December to address the requirements for such ETFs. Livio Weng, COO of Hong Kong-based crypto exchange HashKey, said last week that 10 fund managers, including some backed by Chinese capital, are looking into launching spot crypto ETFs in the city."

        "title": "Choosing Among Spot Bitcoin ETFs - ETF Trends",
        "content": "I\u2019m a big fan of ETF product development, but sometimes the choices can be overwhelming. For example, on our ETF Database platform there are approximately 90 ETFs offering high yield bond exposure. However, as we recently wrote, there are cost and exposure differences between them that impact performance. Last week, nine new ETFs began trading offering direct exposure to spot bitcoin, while one firm turned a pre-existing product into an ETF. This ETF wave is unlike anything I\u2019ve seen in my career.\n\nVettaFi Crypto Symposium Insights\n\nVettaFi hosted a timely virtual event last Friday. The Crypto Symposium featured experts from eight bitcoin ETFs. We talked about why this is a massive win for the advisor community after a multi-year journey. Yet we also covered some of the risks to be aware of when investing.\n\nIn addition, we heard from advisors and investors. For example, VettaFi asked, \u201cWhen Choosing Among Spot Bitcoin ETFs, What Matters Most to You?\u201d, The most popular selection by respondents was Expertise of the Firm with 47% of the total. Liquidity (20%) and Expense Ratio (18%) followed, with Assets Under Management (11%) and Breadth of Offerings (3.6%) further behind.\n\nVettaFi has long advocated for ETF due diligence efforts to go beyond simply choosing the ETF with the lowest expense ratio. However, with spot bitcoin ETFs, the focus on exposure is largely irrelevant. The ten ETFs all own bitcoin, though the price they will buy it for daily might differ. We think this is unlikely to be noticeable to most investors.\n\nETF Fee Battle Started Early\n\nThe expense ratio difference will be more eye catching thanks to a pre-emptive fee battle. At present, seven of the ETFs were charging a 0.00% fee for at least the first three months or till the fund hits an assets threshold like $1 billion or $5 billion. Even when the fees are no longer waived, the expense ratios for many will be largely aligned. For example, the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC), the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitwise Fund (FBTC) would charge 0.19%, 0.20%, and 0.25%, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) had the overwhelming liquidity advantage out of the gate. GBTC was uplisted into an ETF, charging a 1.5% fee, and has $26 billion in assets. The ETF traded $2.3 billion on its first day. This made it the nineth most actively traded ETF in the U.S., regardless of investment style. GBTC had a two cents average bid-ask spread throughout the day. However, GBTC\u2019s peers, led by the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), collectively traded more than $2 billion the first day according to Bloomberg. Volume for bitcoin ETFs in general remained strong in the subsequent days.\n\nAdvisors Told VettaFi They Plan to Add Crypto Exposure\n\nWe believe education about cryptocurrency remains paramount, given that access via ETFs is new. During the symposium, we learned that 58% of respondents expect to have between 1%-5% of their average client portfolio invested in crypto within three months. This compares favorably to the-just 34% that had similar low single-digit exposure last week.\n\nMany advisors are looking for expertise to help them talk to clients about bitcoin, understand how to value the asset, and keep up with industry developments. Catching a replay of the VettaFi cryptocurrency symposium is a good start, as is visiting the Crypto Channel on this platform. From there, you can contact experts at the firm you most want to work with. One benefit for advisors coming to the Exchange Conference in February will be the ability to speak to those experts directly!\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "Bitcoin spot ETFs are creating new market inefficiencies.\n\nCrypto native traders can therefore take advantage of new arbitrage opportunities.\n\nBitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes explained a few of them in his latest blog post.\n\nThe launch of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US is giving professional traders new arbitrage opportunities, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes.\n\nNo Binance? No problem\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF is good news for sophisticated traders, Hayes wrote in a recent blog.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in a long time, the Bitcoin markets will have a predictable and long-lasting arbitrage opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\nHayes pointed out that the ETF\u2019s net asset value \u2014 or NAV \u2014 is determined each day by a CF Benchmarks index price of Bitcoin at 4pm Eastern US time.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nThe index receives prices from six approved exchanges: Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, iBit, LMAX Digital, and Bitstamp.\n\nETF managers in the US will only be able to trade Bitcoin on these exchanges, Hayes said.\n\nBut Binance, with its roughly $4 billion in daily Bitcoin spot trading volume, remains the most liquid crypto exchange and a primary driver of price discovery.\n\nYet, Binance is excluded from the index.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn other words, fund managers won\u2019t be able to trade Bitcoin at the best available price \u2014 only the price quoted on those six exchanges.\n\n\u201cThis unnatural state of play only serves to create more market inefficiencies from which we, as arbitrageurs, can profit,\u201d said Hayes.\n\nArbitrage galore\n\nHayes offered a simple arbitrage scenario.\n\nTraders can bet whether fund managers will seek to create or redeem new ETF shares based on whether the ETF trades higher or lower than its intraday net asset value, Hayes said.\n\nIf it trades higher, they\u2019ll need to create more shares, adding supply to the market and lowering the price. If it trades lower, then managers will redeem shares, lifting shares from the market and reducing supply.\n\nAnd because of the regulatory limitations imposed on them, ETF managers are forced to use CF Benchmark exchanges, pushing prices up or down on these venues depending on whether they\u2019re buying or selling Bitcoin.\n\nThe trade: Traders can simply choose the least liquid exchange on the CF Benchmarks index and compare the price of Bitcoin on the platform against the price of Bitcoin on Binance.\n\nThen, they can buy Bitcoin on the cheapest exchange of the two and sell it on the more expensive one.\n\nPut another way, traders can now frontrun the funds creating or redeeming ETF shares by keeping track of Bitcoin prices on CF Benchmark exchanges.\n\n\u201cHopefully, billions of dollars of flow will be concentrated in an hour-long period on exchanges that are less-liquid and price followers of their larger Eastern competitors,\u201d Hayes said.\n\nHayes also predicted that listed options will soon appear on US options exchanges, using ETF shares as the underlying asset.\n\nNot only will options give traders a liquid way to place leveraged bets on Bitcoin, they will also open up new ETF-specific strategies, such as forward arbitrage \u2014 arbitrage between Bitcoin perpetuals on centralised exchanges and options on US options exchanges.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange filed on Tuesday to list options on spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\u201cOptions will likely be a big hit on these given the volatility,\u201d according to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\n\u201cFor these trading opportunities to last a long time and allow arbitrageurs to execute them in sufficient size, the Bitcoin spot ETF complex must trade billions of dollars-worth of shares each day,\u201d warned Hayes.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 0.79% on the day, trading at just above $42,780.\n\nEthereum fell 1.49% on the day, trading at just over $2,540.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nUpdate: This story was corrected to reflect that CF Benchmarks is the name of the indices provider, not the index itself.\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

        "content": "Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 proposals for spot Bitcoin ETFs, in a significant shift for the industry\u2019s relationship to cryptocurrency.\n\nThe ETFs may be approved, but some independent broker/dealers have put restrictions in place for their affiliated advisors, in many cases not allowing advisors to recommend them to clients and only taking orders if the client asks first.\n\n\u201cThe approvals are not really an indication of the SEC\u2019s feelings about whether or not these fit a portfolio for a client,\u201d said Adam Handler, vice president of product management at Axtella (formerly SPS Family), the parent company of two independent b/ds and one registered investment advisor. \u201cIt\u2019s more around following suit with what they\u2019ve done with other securities to make sure there\u2019s surveillance against fraud and other market manipulation capabilities and there\u2019s volume and a tradable market for them.\u201d\n\nAxtella, which has 716 advisors and more than $22 billion in assets under management, does not currently allow the products on the platform. Handler says the firm will consider in an upcoming product committee meeting whether advisors will be allowed to make unsolicited trades on behalf of clients in the future.\n\n\u201cBest interest\u201d doesn\u2019t apply for broker/dealers when a client makes an unsolicited request for an investment, but even in the case of an unsolicited request, a fiduciary standard may apply on the fee-based side of the platform, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you take on an asset under the advisory side of the business where you\u2019re charging a fee, you have the fiduciary responsibility now to make recommendations on that asset, and holding it in a portfolio\u2014even if it\u2019s a discretionary account where you\u2019re not formally going to a client and communicating with them and saying \u2018Hey we need to sell this, or buy this,\u2019 just holding it in a portfolio and charging on ongoing fee is the equivalent of a hold recommendation,\u201d Handler said.\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which was converted into an ETF, has been the most requested bitcoin product by Axtella advisors, and it too is not allowed on the platform.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to justify from a diligence standpoint to say that, \u2018Hey I\u2019ve researched what you\u2019re investing in enough to tell you this is a good investment for you.\u2019 These vehicles as they stand today are purely speculative,\u201d Handler said.\n\nAxtella expects to educate its advisors on the products, so that clients who come to them wanting to invest understand what they\u2019re buying. But the firm does not plan to put a formal training program in place.\n\n\u201cAs it stands right now, I\u2019m not sure I understand what I would put into a formal training program around these assets. That\u2019s one of the big problems,\u201d Handler said.\n\nCambridge Investment Research is restricting its 3,800 advisors from buying the funds, until they go through a training program which the firm is currently creating, said Seth Miller, president of advocacy and administration and general counsel. Once they go through the training, advisors will be able to access the ETFs.\n\n\u201cWe understand and agree with the regulators that these are complex products, and in order to be able to recommend that complex product, the financial professionals really need to understand how the product works, what the risks and benefits are, so that they can make a best interest recommendation to the client,\u201d Miller said.\n\nSome 250 advisors have requested the training, with 74 of them having completed the training as of Thursday morning. The training consists of 51 slides, with no audio, and includes several \"Knowledge Check\" questions throughout. The program was developed by RegEd, the firm's education and training provider for compliance education, product training and annual compliance programs.\n\nPrior to the SEC approvals, Cambridge was allowing advisors to use other bitcoin products, including those from Grayscale and Bitwise Asset Management. But advisors had to adhere to the b/d\u2019s guidelines limiting the concentration of \"complex products\" in a client's portfolio. Advisors who use the ETFs will also be subject to those concentration guidelines and exposure will count toward the aggregate limit across all complex products.\n\n\u201cIf they are already hitting our threshold or our ceiling on complex products and they want to buy one of these new ETFs, they wouldn't be able to,\u201d Miller said.\n\nCetera Financial is currently developing a policy around advisor use of bitcoin ETFs, and expects \u201ca prudent embrace of these new offerings\u201d by the end of the first quarter, said Matt Fries, head of investment products and partner solutions at Cetera, in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cWith 46 million Americans already owning a share of bitcoin, more investors are exploring incorporating cryptocurrency into their investment portfolios,\u201d Fries said. \u201cWe are working to provide our advisors with the education and guidance to help their clients potentially invest in these products. We are thoughtfully adjusting our existing protocols for new products in the market, and our investment products team is developing a comprehensive policy on bitcoin ETFs for our advisors.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth Financial Network is also not currently allowing its more than 2,100 advisors to recommend the ETFs, nor to discretionarily add them to client portfolios, according to a source close to the IBD, who declined to be named. Advisors are limited to accepting only unsolicited orders for the products.\n\nA spokeswoman for the firm declined to comment.\n\nThe source said the ETFs are in a similar situation to the marijuana ETFs that first came to market in 2015. Because a lot of the marijuana-related businesses inside the ETF deal in a product that is still federally illegal, many IBDs only allowed advisors to accept unsolicited orders for them. They weren\u2019t allowed to provide any sort commentary or guidance on investing in them whatsoever, he said.\n\nHandler said his firm had a full prohibition on those ETFs when they first came out, and there are still some restrictions in place because the underlying product is still federally illegal.\n\nLPL Financial said GBTC is currently the only bitcoin ETF approved for use at the nation's largest independent broker/dealer, with some 22,000 advisors. The firm will not immediately make the new ETFs available, but it is conducting diligence to do so later, with the appropriate controls in place, said Kate Winters, senior vice president of wealth management services.\n\n\u201cThe firm will follow its existing diligence process for approving ETFs,\u201d Winters said.\n\nBut the firm\u2019s advisors must complete required training and meet additional account-level requirements to place orders. Once they meet those requirements, advisors are allowed to solicit purchases in both brokerage and advisory accounts, and they are allowed to use discretion with available ETFs in advisory accounts.\n\nLPL will not be limiting trades to only unsolicited orders, as some others have.\n\n\u201cLPL believes providing advisors with investment product choice is essential for advisors in addressing their client\u2019s needs and wants,\u201d Winters said.\n\nSpokespeople for Osaic, Atria Wealth Solutions, Kestra Financial, Raymond James Financial and Edward Jones declined to comment on the availability of the Bitcoin ETFs on their platforms.\n\nVanguard made it clear that spot Bitcoin ETFs would not be available on its platform, with a spokesperson saying the firm has \u201cno plans\u201d to offer the ETFs or other crypto-related products, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe ETFs are available to trade on Schwab's platforms, and UBS said it was offering some of the ETFs to clients with who approached advisors without being advised to invest in them. Merrill Lynch has also said the ETFs will be available to \u201celigible\u201d clients, referring to ultra-high-net-worth customers with $10 million in assets.\n\nWells Fargo is also moving to provide access to the spot Bitcoin ETFs, with a firm spokesperson saying they are \"available for unsolicited purchases through an advisor with Wells Fargo Advisors\" or via the firm's online WellsTrade platform."

        "content": "Outflows from GBTC are pushing down prices in crypto markets, JPMorgan said Thursday.\n\nIf GBTC loses its liquidity advantage it could see an additional $10 billion in outflows, the bank said.\n\nSpot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US have clocked up big volumes in the first week of trading, yet Bitcoin has fallen 11%. JPMorgan blames investors ditching Grayscale\u2019s ETF.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF, GBTC, has seen over $1.5 billion in outflows since January 11. The exodus has acted as an \u201cadditional drag for crypto markets,\u201d JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a report shared with DL News on Thursday.\n\nThings could get worse for GBTC, as the investment bank estimates an additional $10 billion could leave the fund.\n\n\u201cLiquidity and market depth also matter but again there is risk for GBTC on that front also if other spot Bitcoin ETFs manage to reach critical mass in terms of size and liquidity,\u201d JPMorgan said.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nLiquidity typically refers to the ability to sell an asset for cash. Less liquidity poses a risk for investors as they could find it hard to sell their shares.\n\n\u201cA lot more capital, perhaps an additional $5 billion to $10 billion, could exit GBTC if it loses its liquidity advantage,\u201d the report said.\n\nPrice pressure\n\nFollowing the fund\u2019s conversion from a close-ended trust, investors have taken the opportunity to exit their GBTC positions. Some of these investors \u201chave been taking full profit post ETF conversion by exiting the Bitcoin space entirely rather than shifting to cheaper spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d the report said.\n\nBased on JPMorgan\u2019s estimates, which were made pre-approval, Panigirtzoglou says another $1.5 billion could leave GBTC in the next few weeks. This would put further pressure on Bitcoin\u2019s price, the report said.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u201cWhatever the motive behind the past few days\u2019 $1.5 billion of outflows from GBTC, these outflows are exerting pressure on GBTC to lower its fees,\u201d the report noted, referring to the fund\u2019s 1.5% management fee.\n\nGrayscale is charging far more than its competitors. Ark Invest launched with zero fees for the first year and 0.21% thereafter. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with $10 trillion in assets under management, charges 0.12% for the first year, or on the first $5 billion, rising to 0.25% after that.\n\nInflows into these competing funds have been \u201cdecent,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s report said. The inflows are comparable to previous Bitcoin-related launches, such as Bitcoin futures on the CME and Bitcoin futures ETFs.\n\n\u201cMost of this $3 billion of inflow reflects a rotation from existing Bitcoin vehicles,\u201d JPMorgan said. But it\u2019s not just institutional investors that are moving money. Retail traders appear to be shifting from exchanges to cheaper spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nOn-chain cumulative Bitcoin flows by smaller wallets. (JPMorgan)\n\n\u201cSmaller Bitcoin wallets, typically attributed to retail investors, have seen some retrenchment in recent days,\u201d the bank said. JPMorgan uses on-chain cumulative Bitcoin flows of smaller wallets as a proxy for these investors.\n\nAdam Morgan McCarthy is a markets correspondent for DL News. Have a tip?

        "content": "Cryptocurrency has become a popular option for investing. The crypto market is known for its volatility but has captured the attention of investors looking for new ways to profit in their portfolios. First-time investors commonly need guidance on crypto matters, such as choosing a coin or calculating taxes on crypto trading proceeds.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Investors view crypto assets like Bitcoin as an investment vehicle and seek advice on investing in the market.\n\nFinancial advice from internet searches can be misleading.\n\nCrypto coin hype commonly causes investors to fear they might miss out.\n\nProfessional crypto financial advisors can help guide first-time investors.\n\n\n\nWhy Crypto Advice Is Useful\n\nCrypto-centric communities on major social media platforms are plentiful, with many sharing advice on various topics. Some tokens will do well, while others will be average performers. Unfortunately, as crypto innovations are created, scammers find new methods to defraud unsuspecting individuals.\n\nConsulting a cryptocurrency advisor before investing in a cryptocurrency can help investors make decisions with less risk of being scammed. They are informed about crypto laws and regulations. A crypto financial advisor will bring a professional outlook on the crypto industry, help build a lower-risk crypto portfolio, track crypto trading activities, and prepare taxes effectively.\n\n\n\nCertified Advisors\n\nA certified crypto financial advisor can help investors create and manage a portfolio that includes cryptocurrency. They may hold a Certificate in Blockchain and Digital Assets (CBDA) or a Certified Digital Asset Advisor (CDAA) credential issued by businesses and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\n\nA crypto financial advisor may hold blockchain or digital assets certification. These certificates should not replace the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) or Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) certificates but should be held in tandem.\n\nEducation Platforms\n\nBinance is a cryptocurrency exchange offering a platform for users to buy and sell crypto coins.

Investopedia (this financial content producer) has extensive cryptocurrency coverage, including expert reviews of popular crypto coins and exchanges, beginner guides, a comprehensive collection of terms used in crypto, and news on the latest in the crypto market, among other financial information, definitions, and articles.\n\nRole of Influencers\n\nMany crypto experts include blockchain developers, crypto influencers, and crypto investors. These experts share information on innovations in different blockchains and highlight cryptocurrencies in which they\u2019re heavily invested. Their expertise is shared for informational purposes through social media and is not meant to provide financial advice for individual investors.\n\nVitalik Buterin is a Canadian programmer who co-founded the Ethereum blockchain and Bitcoin Magazine.

He has an active X profile with nearly 400,000 followers as of January 2024.\n\nAdvice to Avoid\n\nFamily and friends who are not directly active as crypto advisors or experts may have limited advice to offer.\n\nOnline communities like Quora and Reddit are forums for discussion and sharing experiences but should not be considered a valued source for personal financial advice.\n\nSocial media platforms that host communities of non-fungible token (NFT) collectors, creators, or crypto enthusiasts are full of members offering \"lucrative opportunities,\" which are unproven and could be a scam for investors.\n\n\n\nCFP Guidelines and SEC Actions\n\nIn 2022, the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. (CFP Board) released guidance about cryptocurrency-related assets to help CFP professionals. The Notice to CFP Professionals Regarding Financial Advice About Cryptocurrency-Related Assets was developed in response to questions about financial advice on cryptocurrencies and crypto-related assets.\n\nThe CFP Board recommends professionals follow regulatory guidance when giving financial advice about crypto-related assets since both the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Financial Industrial Regulatory Authority (FINRA) see potential risks when investing in crypto-related assets. In March 2022, the DOL's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) published compliance assistance, warning 401k plan fiduciaries against cryptocurrency investments.\n\nInvestors can add cryptocurrencies to their portfolio by investing in crypto directly or through an investment vehicle like an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\n\n\nIn Jan. 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot market bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) listed on the NYSE Arca, Cboe BZX, and Nasdaq exchanges. While investors have already gained exposure to crypto through mutual funds, national securities exchanges, peer-to-peer payment apps, and non-compliant crypto trading platforms, the SEC actions will include protections for investors such as full, fair, and truthful disclosure about the products, public registration, and filing.\n\n\n\nWhere Can Investors Locate a Crypto Financial Advisor? Investors can ask the advice of another personal financial advisor or browse the internet and explore credible websites like The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA).\n\nHow Do Investors Verify the Credentials of a Crypto Financial Advisor? An advisor\u2019s credentials can be verified by checking their records with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) Board of Standards, and other membership organizations with which the advisor is associated.\n\nWhat Questions Should Investors Ask a Crypto Financial Advisor? Investors can ask a financial advisor if they think cryptocurrencies are a good financial asset, how to invest in crypto, and if the advisor holds any crypto investments.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHiring a qualified crypto financial advisor can help investors manage many matters that arise from investing in a new asset. The advisor can help choose investments, manage crypto taxes effectively, and provide financial planning advice.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Impact of Bitcoin ETFs: 'Revolutionary change' or colossal 'dud'? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After pushing for more than a decade, the cryptoverse finally got what it wanted: Bitcoin (BTC) for sale and trading on major United States stock exchanges \u2014 albeit in the form of an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nBut be careful what you wish for. No sooner had the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) handed the crypto sector a belated Christmas gift 10 years in the making than Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price pulled downward again.\n\nMany predicted that this drawback would happen, and it\u2019s probably just a hiccup, but it raises questions about the aftereffects.\n\nWill the SEC approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10 have long-term reputational consequences for Bitcoin, offering further validation that crypto has moved into the economic mainstream?\n\nWill the ETFs really bring back customers who were burned during the crypto winter? Are individual investors ready to dive back into Bitcoin after the past years\u2019 bankruptcies, scandals and price gyrations?\n\nWhat if major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity build their Bitcoin ETFs and nobody comes? What is the probability that the new ETFs \u2014 appearing for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the Chicago Board Options Exchange on Jan. 11 \u2014 will fail to gain traction with investors?\n\nReputationally enhanced?\n\nRegarding enhancements of the so-called Bitcoin brand, \u201cI believe SEC approval will cement Bitcoin\u2019s reputation,\u201d John Nahas, senior vice president of business development at Ava Labs, told Cointelegraph.\n\nBitcoin was already in the economic mainstream before the approval, in his view, but the new U.S. ETFs \u201cwill only reinforce the early adopters, further solidify its many supporters and begin to convert the remaining skeptics,\u201d explained Nahas. It will no longer be seen as a fringe or exotic asset but as one embraced by traditional financial players.\n\nChris Brodersen, managing director at business advisory and accounting firm EisnerAmper, was more measured, suggesting that what really matters still lies ahead. SEC approval is just that \u2014 \u201capproval of a non-security commodity\u201d \u2014 not an endorsement, he told Cointelegraph. \u201cHowever, the result of the approval will be an expansion in the discussion of Bitcoin, its underlying technologies and ultimately its value in a diversified portfolio.\u201d\n\nThe real importance of the increased investment into cryptocurrencies that may come from the ETFs is that it will potentially \u201cserve as a catalyst for innovation and adoption,\u201d said Brodersen, adding:\n\n\u201cLooking beyond the ETFs, the question still remains: How will the crypto ecosystem engage with the broader financial ecosystem?\u201d\n\nShayne Higdon, co-founder and CEO of the HBAR Foundation, told Cointelegraph something similar, emphasizing the importance of the underlying technology, which now gets a closer look from the public at large: \u201cWhile many investors and crypto advocates view Bitcoin as digital gold, the underlying value of blockchain technology is often overlooked.\u201d\n\nRecent: Avalanche embraces memecoin culture despite criticism\n\nIn the meantime, Bitcoin itself still has some ways to go. \u201cMass adoption and price appreciation are needed before Bitcoin can earn this \u2018precious commodity\u2019 status, and true validation will only occur if asset managers, private wealth management advisers, and similar entities invest in Bitcoin over the coming year,\u201d said Higdon.\n\nWill a spot market Bitcoin ETF attract retail investors in any significant way? Are individual investors ready to dive back into crypto after the past years\u2019 bankruptcies, scandals and price gyrations after the so-called crypto winter?\n\nThere are reasons to think that last week\u2019s events can make a difference on this score. Nahas said that ETF approval gives new assurances and security at the governmental level and institutional level, further explaining:\n\n\u201cThese [asset managers] are longstanding, deeply entrenched financial institutions that perform extensive due diligence. They would not support any asset unless they had thoroughly vetted it and there was substantial demand.\u201d\n\nEstablished firms like BlackRock and Fidelity are supplying a needed function for small investors. Cryptocurrencies demand a certain level of technical and self-custody know-how that lies beyond the realm of many rank-and-file investors.\n\nGenerally speaking, mass market consumers aren\u2019t ready for cryptocurrency exchanges or noncustodial wallets, according to Nahas.\n\nRegarding the continued effects of the so-called crypto winter on potential retail investors: \u201cDespite the recent challenges related to volatility caused by scandals and bankruptcies owing to things like Terra, FTX and Celsius, there remains a significant interest in the opportunity of owning cryptocurrency by retail investors,\u201d opined Brodersen.\n\nAn \u201cinvestable commodity \u2014 like any other\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still perhaps too early for most consumers to appreciate the difference that crypto ETFs can make. Individual investors now have the ability to hold BTC \u2014 and perhaps ETH too soon \u2014 alongside their stocks, bonds and other tradable assets, said Nahas, adding:\n\n\u201cMost people are not comprehending the enormity of the barrier that has been lifted, making the ETF an easily investable commodity like any other.\u201d\n\nOthers say what retail investors do or do not understand could be beside the point. \u201cWhether the average person is ready for Bitcoin may not be all that important right now because their advisers will bring them in anyway,\u201d said Henry Robinson, founder of the Decimal Digital Group, a cryptocurrency mining, infrastructure and technology company.\n\nIn the increasingly competitive race to surpass investment benchmarks, \u201cwealth managers will not be able to afford to ignore Bitcoin because they risk losing to their peers,\u201d said Robinson. They will \u201chave to take some exposure.\u201d\n\nWhat if no one comes?\n\nBut what if Bitcoin ETFs fail to gain much traction with retail investors? What happens then?\n\n\u201cThe probability of this is almost zero,\u201d Higdon told Cointelegraph. \u201cLarge asset managers would not have put forth the effort to file and create an ETF if there wasn\u2019t significant demand from their clients.\u201d Those issuers, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, et al., simply want to provide a regulated means for their clients.\n\n\u201cIf ETFs are a dud, we may see capitulation from buyers over the last six months who intended to front run higher prices than were realized,\u201d said Robinson. The result could be another extended bear market.\n\nBTC price briefly spiked and then dropped following the ETF approvals. Source: Cointelegraph\n\nCrypto ETFs are really just a temporary fix anyway. \u201cOver time, we expect ETF holdings to peak and then dwindle in BTC terms,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to hold BTC in a wrapper for a maintenance fee.\u201d\n\nOne of Bitcoin\u2019s major advantages as a store of value is its costless storage, which doesn\u2019t really jibe with ETFs, even though the latest round of ETF issuers have gone to lengths to discount fees, at least initially. \u201c[ETFs] role in greater [BTC] adoption can\u2019t be understated, but they are also temporary,\u201d said Robinson.\n\nThe notion that \u201cnobody comes\u201d is not likely, Brodersen added. \u201cOnce the initial excitement wears off, we\u2019re likely to witness a relatively slow but increasing interest by retail investors.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the potential upside is enormous. Even 1\u20132% allocations, if done at scale, \u201ccould have an outsized impact on the overall market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market,\u201d said Brodersen.\n\nNahas, too, was confident that the new ETF issuers had already effectively scoped out customer demand. \u201cBlackRock and their peers would not be in business if they speculated on what assets would have demand or not,\u201d he said, adding:\n\n\u201cDemand comes from clients. That is what\u2019s driving this ETF. Many of these issuers were not inclined to support any digital assets, and now they are issuing a Bitcoin ETF.\u201d\n\nA watershed moment?\n\nWill people one day look back on last week\u2019s events as a historic milestone in the journey of the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency?\n\n\u201cWe do believe this is a watershed moment for Bitcoin,\u201d said Robinson, though there may be a BTC availability shortage soon, he added:\n\n\u201cBitcoin taken off the market by ETFs is setting up a supply squeeze. The new capital will catapult the industry to a manyfold greater integration with global finance.\u201d\n\nGauging historical \u201ctipping\u201d points can be tricky, of course, and a matter of endless debate. \u201cThe true watershed moment for Bitcoin was the release of its white paper and the mining of its genesis block,\u201d said Brodersen. Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin white paper was published in October 2008, and the first Bitcoin was mined in January 2009.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this is a positive step toward increased adoption and investment in the digital asset space,\u201d acknowledged Brodersen, but mass adoption will require more than the \u201csynthetic exposure to the price of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nRecent: On-chain data in a volatile market: How traders stay ahead of the curve\n\nIt will also require better regulatory frameworks, as well as a deeper understanding, generally, of the costs and benefits of decentralized ledger technologies \u2014 \u201cand, most importantly, the demand for such alternatives.\u201d\n\nHigdon was more sure of last week\u2019s significance. \u201cWe will look back on this day as the catalyst that sparked revolutionary change in the finance and banking world. While the exact extent of this change is yet to be known, we cannot overstate the significance of this approval.\u201d"
