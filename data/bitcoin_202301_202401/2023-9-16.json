        "title": "Can Bitcoin Reach $100,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -1.25%) has been a winning investment this year, with its price up almost 60% in 2023 (as of Sept. 15). Interest from investors is growing after a tumultuous 2022 that saw digital asset prices tank as major businesses in the industry blew up. But it might be a good idea to set your eyes on a new price target, even after the huge gain this year.\n\nIn November 2021, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of nearly $69,000. And while it's 62% off that peak right now, I believe that the world's top cryptocurrency can reach $100,000 within the next five years. By looking at the quantitative and qualitative factors, I think other investors would tend to agree with this forecast.\n\nRunning the numbers\n\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin's price is roughly $26,000, and its market cap is just over $500 billion. To keep the calculation nice and simple, if the crypto hits $100,000, it would translate to a gain of 300% in the next five years, good for an annualized increase of 32%. That return would surely crush the rise of the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite, but it would match Bitcoin's trailing-five-year return.\n\nIn five years, Bitcoin's market cap would total $2 trillion. That might seem like a lot, but consider that the total value of all the gold on Earth is about $12.5 trillion. As Bitcoin becomes a more legitimized and widely accepted store of value, it should steadily creep up on the total market cap of the popular precious metal. But even in our scenario, Bitcoin would only be worth 16% of gold, a penetration rate that might seem conservative to some bulls.\n\nAt a roughly $2 trillion market cap, Bitcoin would still be less valuable than Apple, which is currently worth $2.7 trillion, and Microsoft, with a value of $2.5 trillion. So while a $100,000 price target might seem like a lofty expectation at first glance, it still leaves Bitcoin trailing some of the most successful businesses of all time, a completely reasonable outlook.\n\nWhy should demand rise?\n\nThose calculations make sense and aren't a stretch of the imagination to believe, but the ultimate question remains why more individuals, institutions, or governments would even want to own Bitcoin in greater quantities in the years ahead. It's illuminating to focus on this asset's qualitative characteristics.\n\nAccording to bitinfocharts.com, Bitcoin can only process less than six transactions per second (TPS). This pales in comparison to Visa, the card payments giant, which can theoretically handle 65,000 TPS. Consequently, Bitcoin hasn't shown much promise as a medium of exchange in day-to-day payments. In fact, in developed countries, the existing payments infrastructure works pretty well.\n\nHowever, I believe that Bitcoin's key thesis centers on more parties using it to store their wealth. From a basic supply-and-demand perspective, owning an asset of which there will only ever be 21 million coins seems like a smart decision. As demand rises combined with a fixed supply cap, the price is set to continue climbing higher over time, even though it won't be a smooth ride.\n\nBesides the promise of huge financial returns, Bitcoin can be a worthy store of value when compared to fiat currency. Government-backed money has been devalued over the past century thanks to enormous amounts of money creation, particularly in the past decade or so. This has resulted in the U.S., a country viewed as the world's economic powerhouse, having a whopping $33 trillion in debt outstanding, a figure that has expanded over time and that doesn't include underfunded liabilities like Medicare and Social Security.\n\nI think more market participants, whether individual or institutional investors, corporations, or even governments, are starting to look at Bitcoin as a hedge against something breaking with the traditional financial and monetary system. As more learn about this cryptocurrency, it's not crazy to believe that its price should approach the $100,000 mark. I wouldn't be surprised to see this milestone reached by the end of 2028."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nBitcoin's annual transaction volume has outpaced Visa. This is a significant milestone, especially when you consider that Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network and has not achieved global usage on the scale of Visa. But before popping the champagne, let's delve into some nuances that often go unnoticed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst off, the term \"transaction volume\" can be a bit misleading. In Bitcoin's case, a large chunk of network activity in the past year came from Ordinals \u2014 a protocol that allows satoshis in the blockchain to be assigned a unique identifier and transacted with extra data like images, for example. The protocol conducts high-frequency transactions. So, while the sheer volume of transactions is impressive, it is not necessarily indicative of widespread retail use or adoption.\n\nBitcoin has surpassed Visa's annual transaction volume. Pretty incredible for a decentralized settlement network.\n\n\n\nNext up: ACH and ultimately Fedwire. pic.twitter.com/32VTILMNXI \u2014 Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) September 16, 2023\n\nNow, why is it tricky to compare Visa and crypto networks like Bitcoin in terms of transactions? Well, Visa is a centralized payment system that has been around for decades, fine-tuned for consumer transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a decentralized network where transactions can represent anything from a coffee purchase to a multi-million-dollar asset transfer. The two are fundamentally different beasts, each with its own set of rules, limitations and use cases.\n\nThat said, Bitcoin surpassing Visa in transaction volume is still a momentous occasion. It is a testament to the growing influence of decentralized networks. It also raises questions about what the financial landscape could look like in the future. Could decentralized networks one day become the norm, rendering centralized systems obsolete?\n\nAs for now, full adoption of decentralized payments is not going as smoothly as crypto enthusiasts would expect. El Salvador's experiment has clearly shown numerous weaknesses and issues the general population faces when interacting with digital payments."

        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\nPaxos confirms it\u2019s responsible for paying a $500K Bitcoin transaction fee\n\nThe Bitcoin miner who received 19.8 BTC in fees from blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos has returned the funds following Paxos\u2019 claim that it made a mistake in paying over $500,000 in transfer fees. On Sept. 10, Paxos paid the six-figure fee to move $2,000, with the average network fee typically being around $2. The company later acknowledged the mistake, confirming the transfer came from its servers. Almost a day after Paxos\u2019 claims, the Bitcoin miner who received the funds went on X (formerly Twitter) to express frustrations after agreeing to refund the amount to Paxos. The funds were returned on Sept. 15.\n\nCourt approves sale of FTX digital assets\n\nA bankruptcy court has approved the sale of FTX digital assets in weekly batches through an investment adviser and under preestablished guidelines. The sale does not include Bitcoin, Ether and \u201ccertain insider-affiliated tokens,\u201d which can be sold through a separate decision by FTX after 10 days\u2019 notice. FTX sales are not expected to have a heavy impact on markets. According to a recent shareholder update, the bankrupt exchange has $833 million worth of Bitcoin and Ether. A total of $3.4 billion is held in Digital Assets A \u2014 the top 10 assets the company holds \u2014 which include Solana, Bitcoin, Ether, Aptos and others.\n\nGemini Earn users could recover all funds in new DCG remuneration scheme\n\nDigital Currency Group has proposed a new agreement plan for the creditors of the now-bankrupt Genesis Global. The plan estimates unsecured creditors will receive \u201ca 70\u201390% recovery with a meaningful portion of the recovery in digital currencies.\u201d Additionally, the remuneration plan says the recovery of claims for Gemini Earn users would be projected at \u201capproximately 95\u2013110%\u201d without any contribution from Gemini. According to the filing: \u201cIf Gemini were to agree to provide $100 million to Gemini Earn users under the Proposed Agreement, as it previously did, there would be little doubt Gemini Earn users would receive more than full recovery.\u201d\n\nFranklin Templeton files for spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nAsset manager Franklin Templeton applied with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to the application, the fund would be structured as a trust. Coinbase would custody the BTC, and The Bank of New York Mellon would be the cash custodian and administrator. Franklin Templeton has $1.5 trillion in assets under management and joins a long list of asset managers waiting for regulatory approval. The SEC recently delayed decisions on spot ETF applications from WisdomTree, Valkyrie, Fidelity, VanEck, Bitwise and Invesco on Aug. 31.\n\nTwo more top executives depart Binance.US amid layoffs, SEC action\n\nThe exodus of executives from crypto exchange Binance has reached the firm\u2019s offshoot in the United States, as at least three top employees left Binance.US over the past few days. This week\u2019s departures included the exchange\u2019s CEO, Brian Shroder, alongside legal head Krishna Juvvadi and chief risk officer Sidney Majalya. The mass exit is believed to be tied to the ongoing U.S. investigation into Binance and Binance.US. The SEC sued Binance.US, Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao in June for allegedly engaging in unregistered securities operations and other improprieties. On Aug. 28, the agency requested to file sealed documents in the case, fueling concerns about a criminal probe by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $26,465, Ether (ETH) at $1,628 and XRP at $0.50.

        "content": "Bitcoin dipped on Monday morning in Asia to trade at around US$26,500. Ether also moved lower but stayed above its US$1,600 support level. Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies dropped, with Toncoin leading the losers with a slide of over 4%. Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX received court approval last week to sell its crypto holdings of around US$3.4 billion, which could add to the selling pressure in the crypto market \u2014 especially altcoins \u2014 for the rest of the year. U.S. stock futures edged up as investors await the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision this week. Wall Street closed lower on Friday, as mixed economic data in the U.S. moderated the investor\u2019s risk appetite.\n\nBitcoin, Ether dip; selling pressure from FTX liquidation\n\nBitcoin edged down 0.18% in the last 24 hours to US$26,492.52 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong and went up 2.60% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached US$26,840.50 on Friday, the highest price since August 17.\n\nEther dipped 0.87% to US$1,619.94 and traded flat for the week with a 0.18% uptick.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies booked losses in the past 24 hours. Binance\u2019s BNB token was the only exception, rising 0.66% to US$216.23 while adding 1.80% for the week.\n\nDespite the uptick in BNB prices, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange faces mounting regulatory challenges. The firm\u2019s U.S. affiliate Binance.US has laid off one-third of its staff and saw its Chief Executive Officer Brian Shroder leave the company last week, citing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) \u201caggressive attempts to cripple\u201d the crypto industry. The exchange also lost its legal and risk executives last week, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe crypto market is facing pressure from the liquidation of FTX, which plans to sell its US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets by the end of 2023. The bankrupt exchange\u2019s top three crypto holdings are Solana (US$1.162 million), Bitcoin (US$560 million) and Ether (US$192 million).\n\nStory continues\n\nFTX said it will gradually sell the holdings with a US$100 million weekly cap to avoid a negative impact on crypto prices, but this limit could expand to US$200 million upon approval from two committees representing FTX customers.\n\n\u201cSales of this size are destined to have an impact,\u201d wrote blockchain research firm K33 on Friday. \u201cEspecially altcoins with limited liquidity are exposed, making it vital for altcoin traders to maintain comprehensive oversight of FTX\u2019s holdings.\u201d\n\nThe ongoing Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the U.S. could also be contributing to the underperformance of altcoins, said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cThis is probably led by investors betting on ETFs becoming a thing -at some point in the future \u2014 and not wanting to miss out. Conversely, altcoins that are still at risk of being labelled as \u2018securities\u2019 aren\u2019t benefitting from the same enthusiasm,\u201d said d\u2019Anethan.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.73% in the past 24 hours to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume dropped 12.08% to US$17.53 billion.\n\nU.S. equities futures rise ahead of Fed meeting\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell|Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures moved up as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, after Wall Street closed lower on Friday, with Nasdaq Composite leading the losers with a 1.56% slide. The three major U.S. indexes closed the week mixed, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq booking losses while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging up 0.12%.\n\nMost main stock indexes in Asia went lower on Monday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all logged losses, while Japan\u2019s stock market is closed due to a public holiday and will return on Tuesday.\n\nWall Street\u2019s Friday slide was spearheaded by major tech corporations including Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Corp. and Adobe Inc., which all closed the day over 3.5% lower.\n\nTechnology\u2019s\u2019 slide coincided with a Reuters report on Friday stating that TSMC, a Taiwan-based semiconductor manufacturer that provides chips to companies like Apple, had told its suppliers to delay delivery of high-end chip-making equipment due to concerns over customer demand.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. economic data on Friday sent mixed messages to the market. The U.S. industrial production rose 0.4% by month in August. Although the reading was held back by a 5% drop in the output of motor vehicles and parts, it still beat the analysts\u2019 expectation of 0.1%.\n\nThe rebound in industrial production followed the August consumer price index (CPI) release last week that showed the core CPI \u2014 the Fed\u2019s favored inflation gauge \u2014 logged its smallest annual increase since September 2021.\n\n\u201cWe really continue to see that growth resilience story, and I think that\u2019s difficult for the market simply because there\u2019s concern about what that could mean both for rates and inflation,\u201d Lisa Erickson, head of public markets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in its meeting on Sept. 20, which is currently in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%. It gives a 73% chance for another pause in November, up from 63% on Friday.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed leaves interest rates unchanged, it is likely to have a positive impact on higher-risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. Steady interest rates can be indicators of stability, which could encourage investors to seek alternative assets like cryptocurrencies,\u201d said John Stefanidis, chief executive officer and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure decentralized organization Balthazar DAO.\n\nWith most analysts expecting a pause of rate hike in September, all eyes are now on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s remark that will come with the rate hike decision on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWith last week\u2019s higher-than-expected inflation data and the ongoing rise in oil prices, Fed\n\nChair Powell could communicate a relatively hawkish message. However, based on our analysis, we would not expect the market to buy into this for much longer as the inflation trend is still lower,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed report.\n\nElsewhere, China\u2019s industrial production and retail sales logged an annual increase of 4.5% and 4.6% in August, both accelerating from the previous month and beating the analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the peak pessimism is behind us,\u201d Ding Shuang, chief economist for greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Plc., told Bloomberg on Friday. \u201cAugust\u2019s data indicates that the economy is unlikely to suffer from a persisting, deeper downturn going forward even though there might still be some volatility ahead \u2014 especially if we take into account the policy factor.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

Life Beyond has previously released gaming NFTs on Ethereum scaling network Polygon.\n\n\u201cI'm very excited for our Life Beyond Studios to be pioneering the use of Bitcoin Ordinals,\u201d Animoca Brands CEO Robby Yung told Decrypt.\n\nYung added that continuous innovation is a hallmark of the Web3 industry, and with the emergence of Ordinals on the scene this year, it's only fitting that Animoca would try to push the envelope in their application.\n\nOrdinal inscriptions are digital assets that are digitally archived to a single satoshi, the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin (1/100,000,000 BTC). Although trading activity around these virtual artifacts is down in recent months, new products are continuously surfacing including a social graph and another planned Bitcoin metaverse ecosystem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe're still in the early innings, but the potential for Bitcoin to become more than just a store of value is immense,\u201d said Benjamin Charbit, co-founder and CEO of Darewise Entertainment, in a statement.\n\nAnimoca Brands is a major player in the metaverse space and has invested in hundreds of companies and projects, netting a $5.9 billion valuation as of September 2022.\n\nThe company also publishes various NFT-based games, including the Ethereum metaverse game The Sandbox. Animoca recently raised $20 million in funding for its new metaverse project, The Mocaverse, one of many such gaming initiatives under its umbrella.\n\nYung clarified to Decrypt that the Bitcoin metaverse token is \u201cseparate from the Mocaverse, although Life Beyond Studios are a part of the project.\u201d He added there will be further \u201ccollaborations between the AAA universe they're building and the wider Mocaverse.\u201d"

        "title": "Warren Buffett: \"I Wouldn't Buy All of Bitcoin for $25\" - GOBankingRates",
        "content": "Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has never been shy about expressing his opinions on various investments. And when it comes to bitcoin, he has made his views abundantly clear.\n\nAt the 2022 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting, Buffett compared bitcoin to farmland and apartment complexes, stating, \u201cIf the people in this room owned all the farmland and you said for a 1% interest in all the farmland in the United States, pay us the bargain price, $25 billion dollars, I\u2019d write you a check for $25 billion. If you did the same with all the apartment complexes in the United States for bargain price, I\u2019d write you a check. Now if you told me you owned all the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it?\u201d\n\nBuffett\u2019s reasoning behind this statement is based on the fundamental value of assets. Farmland and apartments produce tangible value in the form of food and rental income, respectively. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have any inherent productive value. As Buffett pointed out, \u201cThe apartments are going to produce rental, and the farmland is going to produce food, and if I\u2019ve got all the bitcoin, it\u2019s a mystery.\u201d\n\nBuffett further expressed skepticism about the long-term prospects of bitcoin, saying, \u201cWhether it goes up or down in the next year or five or ten years, the one thing I\u2019m pretty sure of is it doesn\u2019t multiply. There\u2019s a magic to it, and people attach magic to lots of things.\u201d\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nBuffett is not alone in his skepticism about bitcoin. His longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, has also expressed his negative views on the cryptocurrency. At the same annual meeting, Munger stated, \u201cIn my life I try to avoid things that are stupid, and evil, and make me look bad in comparison to somebody else\u2026 well bitcoin does all three. First, it\u2019s stupid because it\u2019s very likely to go to zero, second, it\u2019s evil because it compromises the federal reserve system and the Nation Currency system. And lastly, China banned it, so we look more dumb then them.\u201d\n\nBoth Buffett and Munger have long been proponents of investing in businesses that produce tangible value over the long term. Their skepticism about bitcoin stems from the fact that it does not have any inherent productive value and its future prospects are highly uncertain.\n\nWhile some investors view bitcoin as a potential store of value or a hedge against inflation, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger see it as a speculative investment with no inherent productive value. Their comments at the 2022 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting highlight their belief in investing in assets that produce tangible value over the long term, and their skepticism about the long-term prospects of bitcoin. Whether you agree with their views or not, it\u2019s always important to consider multiple perspectives before making investment decisions.\n\nEditor's note: This article was produced via automated technology and then fine-tuned and verified for accuracy by a member of GOBankingRates' editorial team.\n\nInvesting for Everyone\n\nMore From GOBankingRates"

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s MVRV ratio showed intense bullish potential for the long term.\n\nThe average cost basis revealed that a price jump was not there yet.\n\nBitcoin [BTC], despite having a positive Year-To-Date (YTD) performance, still has a massive potential for growth in the long term. This was the opinion of pseudonymous on-chain analyst Crazzyblockk.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nShort-term holders can\u2019t dream now\n\nCrazzyblockk, who posts regularly about the market sentiment on CryptoQuant, pointed to the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio as grounds for his opinion. The MVRV ratio is calculated as the ratio of an asset\u2019s market capitalization versus its realized cap.\n\nBy comparing these two metrics, the metric can be used to get a sense of when the price is above or below \u201cfair value\u201d, and to assess market profitability.\n\nFrom the chart above, and as confirmed by Crazzyblockk, the MVRV ratio was above 1. Explaining how the metric relates to the price and market cap, Crazzyblockk concluded:\n\n\u201cWe are still above level 1 of the MVRV Ratio, and based on the Holders\u2019 Cost basis, Realized Cap< Market cap.\u201d\n\nHowever, the analyst mentioned that the bullish long-term picture does not apply to short-term holders. In addressing this part, Crazzyblockk explained that there was little to no confidence in the market that could change the sentiment, saying that short-term holders were at a \u201chuge disadvantage.\u201d\n\nWatch out for $27,500\n\nBut for the mid-term, the analyst mentioned that there was hope for relief. He also added that Bitcoin\u2019s potential to rise above $30,000 would depend on the $27,500 to $29,000 break-even zone.\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, Crazzyblockk analyzed the state of the Bitcoin realized price. The realized price gives the average cost basis at which all Bitcoins were purchased. This is done by considering the value of all BTC at the price they were last transacted on-chain, divided by the number of bitcoins in circulation. So, the analyst wrote,\n\n\u201cIf we look at the average realized price of these holders or the amount of money they have paid for each bitcoin, the price levels of 27.5k-29k is the break-even area of these holders\u2019 pockets.\u201d\n\nRead Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-2024\n\nIn the interim, Crazzyblockk gave a strong warning. According to him, BTC remaining lower than the aforementioned realized prices poses a great risk to the mid-term project. He opined that the longer Bitcoin stays lower than $27,500 the longer it might take to recover. He explained that."

        "title": "Will Bitcoin Surge Above $30K, or Below $20K From Here? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Because Bitcoin (BTC -1.25%) makes up roughly half of the overall market capitalization of the cryptocurrency sector, the direction it trades typically drives the direction of the overall market. While that can be frustrating for investors in many smaller-cap projects, it's also true that Bitcoin's momentum often dictates the price action of other projects across the spectrum.\n\nAccordingly, key psychological thresholds simply get much more attention when it comes to Bitcoin over other digital assets. With the world's largest cryptocurrency currently trading right around $26,000 per token at the time of this writing, there's some significant uncertainty as to which direction this token will trend over the medium term.\n\nBitcoin liquidations continue to drive significant volatility, tend to exacerbate rallies to the upside, and make intraday losses more untenable for investors. Indeed, much of the downside move we've seen in Bitcoin in recent months appears to be tied to such liquidations, with bullish investors seeing more pain than those taking a cautious stance.\n\nWith that said, there are reasons why investors may want to shift their view to a more bullish one moving forward. Let's dive into the bull case and bear case as to why Bitcoin could make a sharp move higher or lower from here.\n\nWhat could drive Bitcoin above $30,000\n\nTo be fair, the $30,000 threshold is one that's more likely to be attained in the near to medium term than the $20,000 level, at least in my view. That's largely because I think investors are about to catch on to the fact that more institutional money is poised to flow into the cryptocurrency sector, and mostly into Bitcoin.\n\nInvestors may have heard the news: A three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals has given a favorable interpretation for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to be launched. This panel granted Grayscale Investments' petition for review, to have its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust rolled into a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWithin the ruling, this panel suggested that the SEC acted arbitrarily in its ban on spot Bitcoin ETFs, accepting the argument that spot and Bitcoin futures markets are extremely highly correlated. Essentially, the panel couldn't answer the question that, if futures ETFs are allowed, why are spot options not available to the public?\n\nThe SEC has delayed making a decision on the spot Bitcoin ETFs on its desk until October. However, it's my view that, at the end of the day, spot Bitcoin ETFs will be available to investors within the next few months. This ruling was pretty definitive, and it's the latest blow for the SEC, which likely won't want to take more losses in its crusade against this sector.\n\nAs more institutional capital flows into Bitcoin, an effective floor may be placed under the token, at least over the intermediate term. There's a tremendous amount of capital sitting on the sidelines in alternative assets such as precious metals and real estate that may be looking for a home in the crypto sector. If a fraction of this capital moves into spot Bitcoin ETFs, the initial buying activity and excitement around capital inflows could create a self-fulfilling price surge.\n\nWhat could push Bitcoin below $20,000\n\nThe crypto sector in general has dealt with a myriad of headwinds over the past two years. From late-2021 highs to today, the price of Bitcoin has plunged from a high of around $69,000 per token to the aforementioned $26,000 level. That decline of more than 60% is painful for investors who bought near the top, but it's certainly not as devastating as other declines we've seen in the sector. In many regards, Bitcoin has been an outperformer relative to the alt coin space, and will likely remain so moving forward.\n\nThat said, many of the same catalysts that forced valuations lower in the crypto sector in 2022 remain in place. Interest rates are likely to remain higher for longer, as inflation continues to hover around twice the Federal Reserve's target (at least on core CPI). For riskier and more speculative asset classes like crypto, that's not a recipe for asset price inflation over the medium term.\n\nAdditionally, the amount of leverage in the crypto sector could drive significant moves to the downside in short order, should some sort of shock materialize. The yield curve has been inverted for a long time (one of the longest inversions in recent history). If we get the shock that many are waiting for, the economy tips into recession, and most of the excess liquidity in the markets dries up, that's not a good sign for Bitcoin.\n\nAre the bulls or bears right?\n\nUltimately, as with other risk assets like equities, bear markets and recessions happen, and valuations take a hit during these periods. I don't have my crystal ball out, so I can't predict if something terrible is on the horizon. However, it's the possibility that a recession could be right around the corner that has many investors on the sidelines.\n\nWe'll see whether the bulls or bears are proven right, but I remain on the sidelines with Bitcoin for now."

        "content": "After forming successive Doji candlestick patterns on the weekly chart for the past three weeks, Bitcoin (BTC) is on target to end the week on a positive note. This is an early sign that the uncertainty between the bulls and the bears is resolving to the upside.\n\nAlthough the recovery is still in its early stages, the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Sept. 20 could boost volatility. The majority of the market participants expect the Federal Reserve to maintain a status quo on rates, but surprises could arise during Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference following the rate decision.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recovery from the strong support near $24,800 has ignited buying interest in select altcoins, which are providing trading opportunities. For these altcoins to continue their upward trajectory, Bitcoin needs to maintain above $26,500.\n\nCould Bitcoin\u2019s relief rally pick up momentum, triggering buying in select altcoins? Let\u2019s study the charts of top-5 cryptocurrencies that are showing promise in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin rose above the 20-day exponential moving average ($26,303) on Sept. 14, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. Since then, the bulls thwarted several attempts by the bears to yank the price back below the 20-day EMA.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBuyers will try to build upon their advantage and drive the BTC/USDT pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($27,295). This level may act as a minor hurdle but if overcome, the pair is likely to reach $28,143. The bears are expected to defend this level with vigor.\n\nIf bears want to maintain the upper hand, they will have to sink the price below the 20-day EMA. That may trap the aggressive bulls and open the doors for a potential retest of the pivotal support at $24,800.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has been trading above the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart indicating that the bulls are buying on dips. This suggests that the traders expect the recovery to continue. If buyers clear the hurdle at $26,900, the pair may climb to $27,600 and eventually to $28,143.\n\nIf bears want to make a comeback, they will have to sink and sustain the price below the 20-EMA. Such a move will clear the path for a further fall to the 50-SMA and later to the strong support zone between $25,600 and $25,300.\n\nMaker price analysis\n\nBuyers propelled Maker (MKR) above the 50-day SMA ($1,162) on Sept. 15, indicating that the bulls are attempting to take charge.\n\nMKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe MKR/USDT pair is on its way to $1,370. This level is likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. If the bulls do not give up much ground from this level, the likelihood of a break above it increases. If that happens, the pair could pick up momentum and dash toward $1,759.\n\nThe crucial level to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($1,162). If this level cracks, it will suggest that the pair may swing inside the large range between $980 and $1,370 for some time.\n\nMKR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls remain in command, but the RSI near the overbought territory suggests a minor correction or consolidation in the near term. The 20-EMA remains the key level to watch on the downside. A break and close below it could indicate the start of a deeper correction toward the 50-SMA.\n\nInstead, if the price bounces off the 20-EMA, it will be a sign that the bulls continue to buy the dips. That may start a rally toward the stiff overhead resistance at $1,370.\n\nAave price analysis\n\nAave (AAVE) surged above the moving averages on Sept. 16, indicating that the bulls have made their move. However, the long wick on the day\u2019s candlestick shows selling at higher levels.\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nA minor advantage in favor of the bulls is that they did not allow the bears to make a comeback and are again trying to sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($59). If they succeed, the AAVE/USDT pair is likely to accelerate toward $70 and later to $76.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($56) is the important support to keep an eye on in the near term. If the price skids below this level, it will suggest that bears are active at higher levels. That could sink the pair to the solid support at $48.\n\nAAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls recently purchased the pullback to the 20-EMA, indicating that the sentiment has turned positive. Buyers will try to propel the price above the resistance at $63. If they can pull it off, the pair could soar to $70.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that demand dries up at higher levels. The pair could then slide to the 50-SMA which may attract buyers.\n\nRelated: How low can the Bitcoin price go?\n\nTHORChain price analysis\n\nTHORChain (RUNE) has staged a smart recovery in the past few days, indicating that the buyers are attempting a comeback.\n\nRUNE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe up-move is nearing the solid resistance at $2, which is likely to act as a major roadblock. If the price turns down sharply from $2, it will indicate that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could tug the price down to the 20-day EMA ($1.62).\n\nContrarily, if the RUNE/USDT pair does not give up much ground from the current level, it will suggest that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate the rally to extend further. If $2 is taken out, the pair could start a new uptrend to $2.30 and subsequently to $2.80.\n\nRUNE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the $2 level is acting as a resistance. The price may pull back to the 20-EMA, which is likely to act as a strong support. If the price rebounds off this level with strength, the bulls will again attempt to overcome the obstacle at $2. If they manage to do that, the pair may soar toward $2.30.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-EMA. That could tempt several short-term traders to book profits. The pair may then slump to the 50-SMA.\n\nRender price analysis\n\nRender (RNDR) broke out and closed above the 50-day SMA ($1.58) on Sept. 15, indicating that the selling pressure could be reducing.\n\nRNDR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover, and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating that bulls have a slight edge. If the price turns up from the 20-day EMA ($1.50), it will suggest a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That could start a stronger recovery to $1.83 and then to $2.20.\n\nThis positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price continues lower and breaks below the moving averages. The RNDR/USDT pair could then plummet to $1.38 and later to $1.29.\n\nRNDR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages on the four-hour chart are sloping up, and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating an advantage to buyers. The first support to watch on the downside is the 20-EMA. If the price turns up from this level, it will signal that bulls continue to view the dips as a buying opportunity. That increases the possibility of a rally to $1.77.\n\nOn the contrary, if the 20-EMA gives way, the pair could slide to the 50-SMA. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it may sink the pair to $1.39.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nIt was another week of fairly stable prices for leading cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) grew 3% over the seven days and started Saturday trading at $26,564, while Ethereum (ETH) remains more or less at the same price it was seven days ago at $1,636.\n\n\u200b\u200b\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum\u2019s growth may have been hobbled by reports that its supply recently turned inflationary (meaning more Ether is issued than burned) in one of few such periods since the Merge in September 2022. Last week, Ethereum\u2019s supply increased by 4,092 ETH tokens worth around $6.6 million, per Ultrasound.money data.\n\nThe leading cryptocurrencies traded sideways all week, even after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 (BLS) latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday revealed that inflation had risen a fraction above economists\u2019 projections last month due to rising gasoline prices.\n\nOnly three cryptocurrencies posted any notable price movement this week. Two tokens rallied: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) grew 11.5% to $213.79, while Toncoin (TON) blew up 23% to trade at $2.20.\n\nTON\u2019s explosive price movement this week was catalyzed by news on Wednesday that its parent company\u2014Telegram\u2014has integrated The Open Network blockchain\u2019s Web3 wallet into its messaging app, bringing easy access to TON for the app\u2019s 800 million users.\n\nThe move represents a symbolic win for Telegram. Technically, the company withdrew from involvement in TON in 2020 after litigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Telegram was accused of offering unregistered securities in the form of a token called Gram. It settled with the SEC by paying a fine of $18.5 million and returning unspent funds to investors.\n\nOne cryptocurrency notably depreciated over the week: Stellar (XLM) fell 9.3% to trade at $0.118263 at the time of writing. Its poor performance this week appears to be a correction from last week, when XLM rallied 10% off the back of a tweet that promised \u201csomething cool\u201d in ten days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWas it a major network overhaul? Nope, it was a big-budget commercial with Idris Elba.\n\nIn the news: adoption!\n\nThere were more encouraging signs of crypto adoption throughout the global north this week.\n\nOn Monday, Sony subsidiary Sony Network Communications announced it was developing a blockchain network in collaboration with crypto tech firm Startale Labs. The Singapore-based joint venture will be known as Sony Network Communications Labs Pte. Ltd. It remains unclear what Sony may use the platform for.\n\nAmerican payments giant PayPal launched crypto to USD off-ramps on Tuesday. The move came after PayPal launched a crypto On Ramp integration last month, enabling direct crypto purchases to MetaMask and Ledger users. Undoubtedly, the company\u2019s biggest move in the space this year was the announcement of its own in-house greenback-pegged stablecoin PayPal USD.\n\nFinally, on Wednesday, Taurus\u2013a Swiss crypto fintech firm\u2014announced an agreement with Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank will also use Taurus\u2019 infrastructure to offer custody and tokenization services for its customers, according to a press release shared with Decrypt."

The remittance token has been a popular topic since Ripple secured a victory in court against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when Judge Annalisa Torres determined that XRP is a security only when sold to institutional clients. The ruling, though only partial, provided some level of clarity for the payments token.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple records landmark win against the SEC as court rules XRP is not a security except...\n\nXRP may be the next Bitcoin\n\nRipple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse says XRP could be the next Bitcoin, as it has a strong competitive edge over its peers in the crypto sector. Specifically, he says, \u201cFrom the get-go, Ripple has worked with regulators and regulated institutions like banks,\u201d In his opinion, the digital asset\u2019s exposure to a space where there is no regulatory uncertainty, such as the traditional finance sector (TradFi) is in itself a competitive advantage, increasing the chances of the token\u2019s success long term.\n\nAs such, Garlinghouse articulates that with XRP at the core of what Ripple wants to do, it is working to solve some of the original problems that Bitcoin (BTC) set out to solve, which is expected to map out the next generation of digital assets. It comes as RippleNet takes on the SWIFT messaging system in an innovative attempt to solve the nature of a payment taking days to settle instead of seconds.\n\nThe innovation currently boasts over 100 customers, according to Garlinghouse, \u201cranging from some of the biggest banks in the world to payment providers, to the Western Union and MoneyGram,\u201d among others, with Garlinghouse noting that they are signing up more than a bank every week.\n\nDecrease in cost, increase in speed\n\nThe allure of XRP, like XLM, is that countries use it for cross-border payments, unlike tokens used to manipulate the market. Garlinghouse notes that XRP is at the helm of digital asset maturity, providing real value to customers by solving real problems. More broadly, he says, \u201cXRP is 1000X faster than Bitcoin, which means the volatility risk taken around XRP is only for three seconds.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock rumors of shifted focus from Bitcoin to XRP fail to deflate BTC Spot ETF flare."

        "content": "Rumors of BlackRock pivoting its digital currency strategy from Bitcoin to XRP caught fire on social media platform X.\n\nIt sprouts from speculation about the asset manager reassessing its digital asset strategy through portfolio diversification.\n\nMeanwhile, BlackRock is arguably the only positive news around Bitcoin this year, with BTC spot ETF still at the helm of investor interest.\n\nBlackRock asset manager is making headlines on giant social media platform X, only this time not for the usual Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) theme. It comes on the back of speculation that the company could be looking to reassess its digital asset investment. The asset manager is known to have huge volumes of Bitcoin in its holdings. Could it be looking to pivot elsewhere, and if so, what would it mean for the broader digital asset landscape?\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin correlation cheat sheet for portfolio diversification\n\nBlackRock reassessing its digital asset strategy?\n\nBlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, boasting more than $9.1 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM), is trending on social media, and while this is not the first time, the reason is quite concerning. After the ETF-related mania, where BlackRock was among the institutional players in the race to have its Bitcoin Spot ETF filing approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the asset manager is speculated to be shifting its gaze towards XRP.\n\nThe speculation points to a reassessment of the firm's digital asset investment strategy from the flagship crypto to the payments token. Nevertheless, these remain rumors because while the firm has recently been making cautious strides into the crypto market, there is no said evidence to suggest a shifted focus from BTC to XRP.\n\nPossible Implications for XRP\n\nTo play the devil's advocate, XRP's market value could increase if the rumors turn out to be true because of enhanced credibility within the financial services space. Remember, it is a remittance token with multiple applications as it stands, especially in facilitating cross-border transactions. The move would also point to an evolving trend in the market, with institutional investors steadily embracing portfolio diversification to feature other assets aside from Bitcoin, which, as it stands, is limited by scalability and environmental concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, Ripple price remains unfazed by this speculation because of its unfounded nature, with no hints or clear statements from Ripple Labs or BlackRock.\n\nCorrecting the narrative\n\nThe rumor is based on the changing regulatory environment in the US surrounding crypto. Noteworthy, the underlying message about regulation presenting as an obstacle is true. This was indicated by the hesitance or skepticism of banks to use cryptocurrencies because of the absence of clarity on whether financial institutions are allowed to use crypto tokens for their services. As such, the changes and clarity approaching the XRP doors could excite players' interest.\n\nHowever, to say that the current regulatory stance is affecting the BlackRock investment strategy is unfounded, and using rumors of the asset manager shifting focus from Bitcoin to XRP as a bullish fundamental for the payments token could be premature, according to experts.\n\n$XRP Will Be Bought By Blackrock!?\n\n\n\nHuge XRP News Today - HBAR, ALGORAND & More!\n\n\n\nHad to dispel some stupid rumours going around about XRP today!\n\n\n\nNew video is out now! pic.twitter.com/Lt6agXadZn \u2014 MASON VERSLUIS (@MasonVersluis) September 15, 2023\n\nAs it stands, the focus remains on BTC spot ETFs, with crypto enthusiasts eagerly waiting for a decision from the SEC. BlackRock remains among the leading prospects, considering its heft in the space and the successful record of accomplishment with only one rejection against more than 500 approvals thus far.\n\nAlso Read US SEC likely to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, catalyzing marketwide recovery in crypto."

However, the tech-heavy index is on track to be flat to modestly negative for the week as declines in Amazon.com Inc. and Nvidia Corp. drag it lower on Friday. With investors getting ready to parse a bevy of economic data and the Federal Reserve's rate decision next week, it's unclear how stocks will perform going forward.\n\nWill Tamplin, senior analyst at Fairlead Strategies, says it's prudent to not be overly optimistic about the recent gains in Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cOur short-term momentum indicators show improvement, but we are cautious regarding the sustainability of a rally since intermediate-term has deteriorated in recent weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Bitcoin can clear its 50-day moving average, currently near $27,400, it would increase our confidence in a short-term rebound.\u201d\n\nRead More: Bitcoin Is Getting Back to Trading in Tandem With Tech Stocks\n\nThe level investors are now watching on Bitcoin is $28,800.\n\nAny break below that level \u2014 Bitcoin's low in both June and September \u2014 could lead a lot of investors to give up on the digital asset, according to Maley.\n\n\u201cThat $28,800 level is now the \u2018line in the sand' for the Bitcoin bulls,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Bitcoin ended its four-week price decline, recording its first weekly gain since August. The largest crypto asset by market value has increased about 2.5% since last Saturday to about $26,458.\n\nThe digital asset was trading at $26,468, at the time of writing while market bulls are eyeing the $27,000 mark.\n\nThe surge takes Bitcoin to its highest level this month, easing concerns about a potential September downturn that could impact its impressive year-to-date performance.\n\nOn the other hand, formidable resistance is emerging for Bitcoin. The Binance order book shows a strong sell wall indicating this resistance level.\n\nResistance and Resilience\n\nHowever, strong buying is evident at $26,000. Notably, Bitcoin remained resilient in the face of higher-than-expected US inflation data released this week.\n\nRisk sentiments rebounded as US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data showed a 0.6% increase in August, mainly due to rising gasoline prices, which accounted for more than half of the increase.\n\nInflation and Federal Reserve Expectations\n\nDespite this uptick in inflation data, the bulls anticipate that the Federal Reserve\u2019s hawkish narrative will water down, as the agency is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its policy meeting next week.\n\nData from CoinGecko puts Bitcoin\u2019s current market capitalization at over $516 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $11.3 billion, highlighting an uptick in liquidity.\n\nRecall that the crypto market started the past week with significant losses, falling below $25,000 for the first time since mid-June on fears that bankrupt crypto exchange FTX will soon begin unloading all assets digital assets, including more than $500 million worth of bitcoin.\n\nPrice actions validated such macros as Bitcoin broke the $25,500 resistance level coinciding with the market becoming aware of BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF filing in June.\n\nBTC is currently converting the $26,000 level from resistance to support. Until the end of the week, every attempt to break this level resulted in strong sales.\n\nIf Bitcoin stays above $26,000 over the weekend it could be a positive sign, at least in the short term.\n\nAltcoin Market and Catalysts\n\nConsequently, the altcoin market, which includes BNB, Solana, Tezos, and GMX, has also seen decent gains across the market spectrum.\n\nThe altcoin\u2019s rally comes days after traders sold off the tokens, raising the possibility that defunct exchange FTX will receive bankruptcy court approval to sell assets from its crypto holdings that are worth billions of dollars.\n\nThe rally puts altcoin bears, who have placed leveraged bearish bets on SOL and other tokens fearing a potential sell-off from FTX creditors, at risk of liquidation.\n\nExchanges liquidate their positions when the market goes against the trader\u2019s bet, resulting in a lack of margin and the trader not providing additional margin.\n\nForced liquidation of sell orders also added upward pressure on the SOL price, leading to a short-term price increase, as it broke the $19 resistance level.\n\nPositive news this week about asset management giant Franklin Templeton joining the race to list a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) and global lending bank Deutsche Bank\u2019s plans to delve deeper into digital asset custody and tokenization gave the bulls more ammunition, causing prices to rise."

        "title": "Max profit alert? Bitcoin has a total of 32 halving events and we've only seen 3 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) remains at the forefront of discussions as the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve due to its unique setup. Bitcoin\u2019s unique economic model, driven by its halving events, has intrigued the general financial world.\n\nSince the cryptocurrency\u2019s inception 14 years ago, the Bitcoin network has undergone only three halving events. Indeed, according to data provided by crypto content creator Shalva Machitidze, Bitcoin has a total of 32 halving events with 29 remaining, with attention focusing on how the asset will be impacted.\n\nBitcoin halving schedule. Source: Binance Feed\n\nIt is worth noting that halving is one of the key features that sets Bitcoin apart from traditional fiat currencies due to its predetermined issuance schedule. Notably, approximately every four years, or after every 210,000 blocks mined, miners\u2019 reward for confirming transactions and adding them to the blockchain is cut in half.\n\nIn the early days of Bitcoin, miners received 50 BTC per block, but after the first halving in 2012, this reward was reduced to 25 BTC. Subsequent halving events occurred in 2016 and 2020, reducing the reward to 12.5 BTC and then 6.25 BTC, respectively.\n\nBesides reducing miner rewards, the halving event also affects the number of coins in circulation. This impacts supply and demand, causing price fluctuations. Additionally, it curbs Bitcoin\u2019s inflation by reducing new coin creation, aligning with its deflationary design.\n\nWhat to expect from the remaining 29 Bitcoin halving events\n\nWith the remaining 29 halving events, Bitcoin\u2019s predetermined scarcity is often cited as one of the primary factors contributing to the asset\u2019s potential value appreciation. This scarcity, combined with growing demand, has historically driven up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nHistorical data indicates that Bitcoin\u2019s price has experienced significant rallies after previous halving events. Following the first halving in 2012, the price of Bitcoin surged from less than $12 to about $1,000 within a year. Similarly, after the 2016 halving, Bitcoin\u2019s price substantially increased to $20,000 by the end of 2017.\n\nThe most recent halving in May 2020 saw Bitcoin\u2019s price soar from approximately $8,000 to almost $69,000 in late 2021. These historical patterns have fueled optimism among investors and speculators as they eagerly await the next 29 halvings and their potential impact on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price, with 2024 as the next main focus.\n\nWill the next halving event trigger a price rally?\n\nIt is worth noting that past halving events didn\u2019t solely trigger bull markets. Larger macroeconomic factors likely played a significant role, particularly in the form of favorable fiat liquidity conditions led by institutional capital inflow into the asset. For instance, Bitcoin has been battered by high inflation and interest rate decisions over the past year.\n\nAfter the past three halving events, Bitcoin experienced substantial triple-digit price surges, reaching new all-time highs within 12 to 18 months before entering significant downtrends.\n\nInterestingly, these bear markets began to lose momentum approximately 15 to 16 months before the subsequent halving. For instance, Bitcoin has gained almost 55% in 2023, representing a rebound from the previous year\u2019s bear market. This trajectory aligns with the historical timing of previous price recoveries.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin remains steady above the $26,000 level, aiming for a potential rally toward $30,000. By press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $26,608, reflecting daily gains of approximately 0.31%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market continue to grapple with prolonged bearish sentiments, leaving investors vigilant for potential factors that could trigger a rally. Notably, analysts are closely monitoring indicators that might signal the conclusion of the bear market in its second year.\n\nIn particular, a crypto analyst known by the pseudonym Seth_fin in an X post (formerly Twitter) on September 16 sparked optimism by identifying two technical indicators pointing toward a potentially bullish future.\n\nIn his post, the analyst noted that the Bitcoin Gaussian channel has turned green, which can be interpreted as a bullish signal and a possible reversal of the prevailing bearish trend. The Gaussian channel indicator is a technical tool derived from statistical concepts that predict price trend directions in financial markets.\n\nSecondly, he pointed out that the Bollinger Band Width Percentile has reached its lowest level, indicating an impending increase in price volatility.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Gaussian channel just turned green, and we\u2019ve retested the mid-band! Looks like the bear market might be in the rearview mirror. But that\u2019s not all! The Bollinger Band Width Percentile is at its lowest, signaling an impending EXPLOSIVE move!\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Seth_Fin\n\nThe analyst refrained from making a specific directional prediction, emphasizing that the Bollinger Band Width Percentile while signaling heightened volatility, does not specify the direction of the movement.\n\nPossible bullish triggers for Bitcoin\n\nHe did, however, reference the historical significance of Bitcoin halving events. These events, which reduce the rewards for miners, have historically been followed by significant price increases. The last halving event occurred in May 2020 and marked the start of a notable bull run for Bitcoin.\n\nNotably, the Bitcoin halving event continues to be hailed as a potential catalyst for a bullish price surge. At the same time, the spotlight remains on regulatory developments, particularly the potential approval of the first spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), which is expected to attract institutional capital into the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin is making an effort to maintain its position above the crucial $25,000 support level, extending a period of consolidation marked by repeated failures to breach the $30,000 mark.\n\nBitcoin is trading above $26,000, boosted by the news that Deutsche Bank, a German lender, plans to launch cryptocurrency custody services for institutional customers in partnership with Swiss fintech firm Taurus.\n\nHowever, market sentiment remains on edge due to recent developments in the FTX case. The bankruptcy court approved FTX to begin the liquidation of its extensive cryptocurrency holdings. This development has the potential to significantly impact the cryptocurrency market\u2019s dynamics, potentially leading to increased volatility. Notable assets within this substantial cache include tokens such as Solana (SOL), Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and others.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAt the time of reporting, Bitcoin was trading at $26,548, continuing its trend of weekly consolidation. Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency has registered a modest gain of approximately 0.26%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nRegarding technical analysis, one-day indicators sourced from TradingView align with a bearish sentiment. A summary of these indicators suggests a \u201csell\u201d rating at 11, mirroring similar readings from moving averages (8). Oscillators also indicate a \u201csell\u201d at 3.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis price chart.
