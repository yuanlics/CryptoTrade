        "title": "Bitcoin, ether slide on Friday as investors weigh potential fallout from Silvergate woes - CNBC",
        "content": "A pedestrian walks past signage for Ethereum, top, and Bitcoin outside the Hong Kong Digital Asset Exchange Ltd. digital currency trading store in Hong Kong, China, on Thursday, June 24, 2021.\n\nThe drop came late Thursday night, hours after several crypto companies said they'd stopped accepting or initiating payments to or from Silvergate \u2013 including Coinbase, Galaxy Digital, Circle, Paxos and Bitstamp. Silvergate, which has become the go-to bank for cryptocurrency businesses, gave notice Wednesday that it won't meet an extended deadline to file its annual report and warned it may not be able to operate another 12 months.\n\nBitcoin dipped by more than 5% to $22,261.22, according to Coin Metrics. Ether lost 5.5% and traded at $1,555.37.\n\nCryptocurrency prices fell on Friday as investors weighed the latest financial woes at Silvergate Capital and assessed what a potential bankruptcy at the crypto bank could mean for the broader crypto industry.\n\n\"To start 2023, crypto markets enjoyed a solid rally to six-month highs following a slowdown in FTX-related contagion, but the Silvergate news has renewed concerns around liquidity and risk,\" Medalie added.\n\n\"The bearish turn could certainly be a delayed reaction to Silvergate's ongoing issues,\" said Clara Medalie director of research at Kaiko. \"Many large exchanges and market makers partner with Silvergate for fast transactions between entities, and any halt inactivity could have an impact on global crypto liquidity.\"\n\nBitcoin has recovered this year after tumbling more than 60% in 2022 to below $17,000 amid the pullback in risk assets and the implosion of FTX, which was a Silvergate customer. Even after the recent decline, bitcoin is up more than 30% this year \u2014 though it could be in for a month of sideways trading now that the broader rally in risk assets has faded.\n\nCrypto market resilience\n\nAnalysts said the Silvergate woes weren't an obvious trigger for the drop in bitcoin and ether. They also pointed to liquidations, macro factors and technical indicators.\n\n\"Overnight, bitcoin dropped below $23,000, hitting its lowest level in two weeks. In the process, traders were hit by millions of long liquidations,\" Medalie said.\n\nYuya Hasegawa, an analyst at Japanese crypto firm Bitbank, said that drop happened \"without a clear trigger.\" Noelle Acheson, economist and author of the \"Crypto is Macro Now\" newsletter, echoed the point about liquidations.\n\n\"The fact that it was a short and sharp dump, and that bitcoin and ether prices are now bouncing along steadily, suggests that the move was largely structural, and that the market still has considerable resilience,\" she said.\n\nThat resilience was a big takeaway for investors from the February trading month, in which bitcoin and ether suffered a brief drop of 6% and 8.5%, respectively, as U.S. financial regulators began their crypto crackdown. Bitcoin went on to finish the month les than 1% above the flatline, while ether eked out a roughly 2% gain.\n\nGiven the bad news and the ongoing recovery from the FTX debacle in November, investors saw that as a win even though the crypto assets failed to match their double digit January returns.\n\n\"The Silvergate news is really bad, but should not directly affect bitcoin holdings,\" Acheson added. \"It could spook some macro investors, however, who could withdraw and wait for this to blow over.\"\n\nJoel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, pointed to bitcoin's recent inability to \"establish above critical technical resistance in the form of the August 2022 high around $25,200\" and \"global inflation data that continues to suggest central banks, particularly the Fed, will need to keep with a less investor-friendly monetary policy track of higher for longer\" \u2013 in addition to the Silvergate scare.\n\nIf bitcoin fails to hold the $22,000 level, the next stop will likely be around $21,400, where the February low and November high converge, according to Hasegawa."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) fell more than 5% from $23,500 to $22,240 in just over 60 minutes on March 3, amid a wave of uncertainty concerning crypto-friendly bank Silvergate Capital.\n\nThe price drop wiped $22 billion from Bitcoin\u2019s total market capitalization, which is now at $430.9 billion, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro.\n\nEther (ETH), XRP (XRP), Cardano (ADA), MATIC (MATIC) and other non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies also suffered a similar sharp decline.\n\nBitcoin just dropped $1200 in less than 30 minutes. \u2014 The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) March 3, 2023\n\nMarkus Thielen, the head of research at digital asset platform Matrixport, told Cointelegraph that he believes the price fall is linked to the recent Silvergate Bank controversy with its delayed annual 10-K financial report filing, in addition to an increased effort by United States regulators attempting to restrict ties between banks and crypto firms:\n\n\u201cThe drop is due to the continuous fallout from Silvergate Bank, as there is now more uncertainty about fiat on-and-off ramp. In addition, there are now wider industry concerns that U.S. regulators are trying to cut off further banking relationships between crypto firms and FDIC-insured banks.\u201d\n\n\u201cNevertheless, this is playing into the hands of Hong Kong and China, which are becoming more crypto-friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have seen an increase in stablecoin activity as a sign that crypto firms are using crypto rails to move money around,\u201d he added.\n\nSeveral technical analysts on Twitter claimed to have predicted the fall from the $23,000 resistance.\n\nBitcoin price chart. Source: Cointelegraph Markets Pro.\n\nThe last time BTC was priced at $22,250 was Feb. 15.\n\nThe sharp fall comes despite a solid start to 2023, with BTC still up 34.8% for the year. It was changing hands at $16,550 on Jan. 1.\n\nEther has also fallen 4.74% from $1,644 to $1,566, causing a $9 billion wipeout from its market cap over the first hour."

        "title": "Bitcoin Saw Low Volatility During the Month of February - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies and volatility go hand in hand, but when it came to the leading cryptocurrency bitcoin, there was less volatility as more traditional assets were racked with inflation fears and rising interest rates during the month of February.\n\n\u201cBitcoin moved just 0.03% last month in United State dollar terms, making February 2023 likely its least volatile in history,\u201d a Cointelegraph article noted as the cryptocurrency was traded within the $22,000 to $24,000 price level. \u201cData from Coinglass after the monthly close confirms that BTC/USD went practically nowhere for four weeks straight.\u201d\n\nMoreover, bitcoin\u2019s price is actually up over 40% year-to-date compared to the S&P 500\u2019s gain of 3.4%. The leading cryptocurrency\u2019s price fell over 60% last year, making it a volatile experience for investors as it followed stocks and bonds downward amid inflationary and monetary policy tightening pressures.\n\nThat same correlation is spilling over into this year as markets push to rally though inflation and rising rate fears have crept back into the capital markets once again. As such, digital and traditional assets will once again remain fixated on the U.S. Federal Reserve with respect to monetary policy decisions for the rest of the year.\n\nThe Fed is aware that inflation won\u2019t be going away anytime soon. Still, the lack of volatility during the month of February shows bitcoin\u2019s maturation as an asset, especially with an influx of more institutional investors flooding the space.\n\nImproving Risk Appetite\n\nDespite interest rate fears, the global economy has been humming along, pushed even further with China\u2019s reopening after the country dealt with a rise in COVID-19 cases. China\u2019s recent macroeconomic data increased an appetite for risk, lifting bitcoin higher recently.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s official manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 52.6 in February, the highest in over a decade, following January\u2019s 50.1, according to data released on Wednesday,\u201d Coindesk reported. \u201cA reading above 50 indicates an expansion of activity. Non-manufacturing PMI rose to 56.3 from January\u2019s print of 54.4.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe positive news out of China, the world\u2019s factory and largest trading partner of the U.S. and Germany, pushed the U.S. dollar lower against major currencies, lifting risk assets like bitcoin and stocks higher,\u201d the report added.\n\nMeanwhile, bullish bitcoin investors appear to be those who are looking beyond the short term. A Barron\u2019s article noted that bitcoin has been seeing continuous buying from investors with a long-term horizon, confirming that it could still be an opportune time to buy the leading cryptocurrency and hold it for the long term.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "title": "Should You Buy Bitcoin While It's Still Below $25,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "For the first two months of 2023, Bitcoin (BTC 1.52%) has been on a remarkable run. It's now up 41.45% for the year, and trades at just over $23,479. But there are signs that Bitcoin is running out of momentum as it tests the $25,000 mark.\n\nWhile Bitcoin briefly touched the $25,000 level in mid-February, it quickly gave up those gains. And the last time Bitcoin flirted with the $25,000 level back in August 2022, it eventually sank below the $18,000 mark. As a result, the consensus now is that $25,000 is a very important price level for Bitcoin. So can Bitcoin break through the $25,000 level or not?\n\nShort-term outlook\n\nIf you are only taking a short-term outlook, of course, things look particularly dicey for Bitcoin. Everybody is watching the Federal Reserve right now for signs of further monetary tightening. If the Federal Reserve continues to raise rates in order to tame inflation, the thinking goes, then Bitcoin is going to have a tough time breaking through the $25,000 level. At some point, the Fed might trigger a recession, and that's not going to help Bitcoin at all.\n\nMoreover, the price of Bitcoin is now increasingly correlated with the performance of big tech stocks. Over the past 90 days, the correlation of Bitcoin with the tech-heavy Nasdaq is 0.75. This suggests that, while crypto is not marching in lock-step with big tech companies, it is marching at about the same tempo. If you've been following all the layoffs happening in Silicon Valley recently, this is not good news for crypto. It suggests that a real rebound in Bitcoin won't happen until the tech industry fully recovers.\n\nLong-term outlook\n\nHowever, if you take a long-term perspective, the outlook for Bitcoin brightens significantly. The case for Bitcoin global adoption is hard to deny. Just about every head-spinning price prediction made for Bitcoin -- such as Bitcoin at $500,000 or Bitcoin at $1 million -- is based on some scenario in which Bitcoin becomes relatively ubiquitous on a worldwide level.\n\nWhen Cathie Wood and Ark Invest came up with a revised $1.48 million price target for Bitcoin this year, it was based on the assumption that Bitcoin would see tremendous growth in eight key areas. For example, in emerging markets, Bitcoin will eventually represent a greater and greater share of the M2 money supply, a common measure of the money supply. Amongst institutional investors, Bitcoin will account for a larger and larger share of total portfolio holdings. At the same time, Bitcoin will increasingly be held on corporate balance sheets, used for cross-border remittances, and held as a form of \"digital gold.\"\n\nBut that's just part of the global adoption story for Bitcoin. As Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper pointed out in his $250,000 price prediction, Bitcoin will become more and more ubiquitous as a form of payment. Just about anything you buy online will be paid via Bitcoin, predicts Draper. While this scenario might take quite a bit of time to play out, the fact remains that more than one-half of adult Americans now own crypto or have owned it in the past.\n\nAnd, finally, new use cases for Bitcoin continue to emerge. With each new use case, the valuation of Bitcoin will only continue to increase. The one use case that has everyone buzzing now is the ability to store non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin blockchain. These NFTs, known as Ordinals, may only be a passing fad -- or they could be part of a new era for Bitcoin, in which its blockchain is eventually used for much more than just financial transaction processing.\n\nShould you buy Bitcoin?\n\nUltimately, the choice of whether to buy Bitcoin comes down to how you view the market. If you only take a short-term view of the market, then Bitcoin may not look like an attractive buy right now. Why take on all the risk, volatility, and uncertainty of crypto when you can just buy a big tech stock in the Nasdaq?\n\nHowever, if you are taking a long-term view of the market, then Bitcoin below $25,000 looks like a screaming buy. The future growth prospects of Bitcoin just look too good to ignore. While the price of Bitcoin might never reach the $1 million mark, it's hard to see how Bitcoin won't again make a run at its all-time high of $68,789.63. At today's prices, that would represent a nearly 200% return on your investment."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether prices slumped in Friday morning trading in Asia, along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies amid reports U.S.-based cryptocurrency bank Silvergate Capital Corp. could be the next corporate victim of the FTX crash. Polkadot led the losses. U.S. equities rose Thursday after a week of fluctuations on conflicting Federal Reserve comments about interest rates and data suggesting inflation is well entrenched in the economy.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin\u2019s price gains this year bring needed relief to cash-strapped crypto mining industry\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin fell 3.22% in the past 24 hours to US$22,827 as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, extending its weekly loss to 4.78%. Ether dropped 3.19% to US$1,602, for a seven-day fall of 3.33%.\n\nBoth tokens fell as much as 5% later in the Asia morning. Despite the slump, both are still up around 40% for the year to date.\n\nPolkadot led the losers among the top cryptocurrencies, sliding 6.00% to US$6.08, and losing 14.63% in the past seven days. The token has been in a downward trend for two weeks, though the Polkadot community remains active, leading the daily development on Github, according to Github tracker ProofofGithub on Thursday.\n\nSilvergate said Thursday in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the company is evaluating \u201cits ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d which sparked a more than 50% plunge in its stock price. A raft of crypto exchanges and platforms have cut ties with the bank.\n\nAs a Federal Reserve member bank, Silvergate positioned itself as a gate between traditional finance and crypto. The bank was hit hard by the FTX collapse and reported a US$1 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2022. It laid off 40% of its staff in January.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.02% in the past 24 hours to US$1.07 trillion. And the total trading volume over the last 24 hours went down 12.30% to US$42.65 billion.\n\nU.S. equities closed higher on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.05%, the S&P 500 moved up 0.76% and the Nasdaq Composite Index edged higher to 0.73%.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic indicated on Thursday that he supports an interest rate increase of 25 basis points in March, alleviating some recent concern the Fed may hike 50 points. This helped stocks move higher, but the market is caught in cross-currents as Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the same day that recent data suggests the inflation fight is far from over.\n\nData from the U.S. Department of Labour on Thursday showed initial jobless claims fell in the week ending Feb. 25, while labor costs rose, indicating inflation hasn\u2019t been tamed by the Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes so far.\n\nThe Fed set U.S. interest rates between 4.5% to 4.75% in February, the highest since October 2007. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 72.3% chance that the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points this month. They also predict a 27.7% chance for a raise of 50 basis points, a decrease from 29.9% on Thursday.\n\nData from the U.S. services industry is expected on Friday and several other Fed officials will be speaking the same day, which may further add to the mixed messages to markets. Separately, China will kick of its so-called \u201cTwo Sessions\u201d this weekend, the most important political meetings of the year for setting economic policy in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nSee related article: Japanese banks to launch, test stablecoins on \u2018Japan Open Chain\u2019"

        "title": "The Psychology of Bitcoin Investment: The Fear, FOMO, and Greed Cycle - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world's first decentralized digital currency, has taken the financial world by storm since its creation in 2009. While some see it as a revolutionary new way to store and transfer value, others view it as a speculative bubble that is doomed to burst.\n\nWhatever your viewpoint, it is undeniable that Bitcoin is a highly volatile and unpredictable asset that can elicit strong emotions in investors. In this article, we'll look at the psychology of Bitcoin investment and the fear, FOMO, and greed cycle that can lead to irrational decisions by investors.\n\nFear of Missing Out (FOMO)\n\nFOMO is a strong psychological phenomenon that can affect investors of all skill levels. Fear of missing out on potential profits can lead investors to make rash and impulsive decisions, such as purchasing Bitcoin at exorbitant prices or investing more than they can afford to lose.\n\nFOMO is frequently fueled by social media and news coverage of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nKeep Reading Will Blockchain Technology Mark a Turning Point in Fraud Prevention?\n\nFOMO can be especially intense in the world of Bitcoin where prices can change dramatically in a matter of hours or even minutes. When the price of Bitcoin is rapidly rising, investors may feel compelled to invest before missing out on potential profits.\n\nThis can lead to a self-fulfilling cycle in which rising prices fuel even more FOMO, resulting in even higher prices.\n\nFear of Financial Loss\n\nAnother powerful emotion that can drive Bitcoin investors to make irrational decisions is fear of losing money. While all investments involve some level of risk, the volatility of Bitcoin can be particularly intimidating for some investors.\n\nWhen the price of Bitcoin falls rapidly, investors may panic and sell their holdings in order to avoid further losses.\n\nThis fear can be exacerbated by media coverage of Bitcoin crashes and stories of large sums of money lost by investors.\n\nWhile it is critical to manage risk when investing in Bitcoin, it is also critical to remember that all investments involve some level of risk and that Bitcoin has a history of recovering from price drops.\n\nGreed\n\nAnother emotion that can lead Bitcoin investors to make irrational decisions is greed. When the price of Bitcoin rises rapidly, investors may become overconfident and invest more than they can afford to lose. This can create a self-fulfilling cycle in which rising prices fuel even more greed, resulting in even higher prices.\n\nAdditionally, greed can drive investors to make irrational and impulsive decisions, such as investing in unproven or untested Bitcoin-related projects or scams. While it is important to be optimistic about the future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it is also critical to remain rational and skeptical when evaluating investment opportunities.\n\nThe Cycle of Fear, FOMO, and Greed\n\nFear, FOMO, and greed are self-perpetuating cycles that can lead Bitcoin investors to make irrational decisions. When the price of Bitcoin is rapidly rising, investors may feel compelled to invest before they miss out on potential profits (FOMO).\n\nThis can result in overconfidence and irrational investing decisions (greed), which can then result in panic selling when prices begin to fall (fear).\n\nThis cycle is especially dangerous for inexperienced investors who are new to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. It is critical to remember that Bitcoin is a highly volatile and unpredictable asset that can be influenced by a variety of factors ranging from global economic conditions to media coverage and investor sentiment.\n\nKeeping Your Emotions in Check When Investing in Bitcoin\n\nWhen investing in Bitcoin, managing your emotions is critical for long-term success. Here are some pointers to help you manage your emotions when investing in Bitcoin:\n\nKeep up to date: Keep up to date on the latest Bitcoin and cryptocurrency news and developments. This can assist you in making informed decisions and avoiding rash investment decisions based on FOMO or greed.\n\nDiversify your portfolio: When investing in Bitcoin, diversification is essential for risk management. Don't put all of your eggs in one basket, and consider investing in assets other than Bitcoin.\n\nSet clear investment goals and a strategy to achieve them: Stick to your plan even when emotions are running high. This can assist you in avoiding rash investing decisions and sticking to a rational investment strategy.\n\nControl risk: Because bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, it is critical to manage risk when investing. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider setting stop-loss orders to limit your losses if prices start to fall.\n\nConsider the long term: Bitcoin's price can be highly volatile in the short term, but it has a long history of increasing in value. Taking a long-term perspective can help you avoid the fear, FOMO, and greed cycle and stay focused on your investment goals.\n\nFOMO Traders vs Disciplined Traders: What Are the Differences?\n\nThere are several differences between FOMO traders and disciplined traders. We highlight three of the most important ones:\n\nHow both traders do their research: a seasoned trader will do his or her research before committing to a trade while FOMO traders will blindly buy an asset simply due to seeing its price rise.\n\nTheir mental state: seasoned traders will have much more control over their emotions, meaning that before entering a trade, they will have a general idea of how it will turn out. Usually, the planning ahead involves setting up a stop-loss and an exit strategy for when to take profit. Consequently, they will have peace of mind whereas a FOMO trader will see his or her anxiety levels rise due to their lack of planning.\n\nHow they set both set expectations: a disciplined trader will know how to realistically and reasonably set his or her expectations. FOMO traders, on the other hand, simply believe the price will carry on rising and, more often than not, not even have a proper exit strategy lined up.\n\nThese differences are mainly connected to one\u2019s mental state when trading and trading psychology techniques. However, putting in the hard work, even as a FOMO trader will help overcome FOMO. This means having a trading plan, a trading routine, stop losses, a checklist, a trading journal, and so forth.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin investing is a highly emotional and volatile activity that can be influenced by a variety of psychological factors, such as fear, FOMO, and greed. When investing in Bitcoin, it is critical to manage your emotions and remain rational.\n\nYou can avoid the pitfalls of the fear, FOMO, and greed cycle and achieve your investment goals in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency by staying informed, diversifying your portfolio, making a plan and sticking to it, managing risk, and taking a long-term view."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s wings were clipped overnight as it fell 5% and dropped to a 16-day low of $22,267.\n\nThe price on Friday morning recovered slightly, to about $22,300, while the second-most-popular cryptocurrency, Ether, had fallen about 3.5%, to $1,567, over 24 hours.\n\nThe lackluster day for the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency is a setback for investors who seemed increasingly hopeful that it would soon cross the $30,000 threshold, a feat not accomplished since May. Last month, Bitcoin briefly broke $25,000 after months below that level.\n\nPartly to blame for Bitcoin\u2019s nosedive on Friday are the negative results from crypto-focused bank Silvergate Capital. The firm reported a net loss of $1 billion on Tuesday, and on Thursday, the biggest U.S.-based exchange, Coinbase, said it would no longer accept or initiate payments to or from Silvergate. New York-based crypto company Paxos also distanced itself. Silvergate\u2019s stock has crashed more than 60% over the past five days.\n\nStill, Michael Safai, a managing partner at the crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital, said in a statement to Fortune that the market effects of the Silvergate news should be short lived.\n\n\u201cThis is news we knew about for the entirety of the U.S. trading day, but it wasn\u2019t until Asia came on that things started to plunge,\u201d Safai said in the statement. \u201cIt\u2019s more a case of jaded traders digesting the news and not wanting to be left holding any potential ticking time bombs, but not understanding how this differs from the collapses of 2022.\u201d\n\nUnlike the collapse of FTX, which led to its own steep decline in the price of Bitcoin, Silvergate is not a key source of liquidity for the crypto ecosystem.\n\n\u201cSilvergate\u2019s direct impact on market liquidity is very marginal at best, and any impact would be psychological rather than material,\u201d Safai added.\n\nYet, the psychological effects of Silvergate\u2019s fall from grace could still greatly affect the fragile crypto market. A series of collapses from crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital to FTX, along with the frostbite of Crypto Winter, have plagued the industry over the last year. Bitcoin, which makes up just under half of the total crypto market share, is down 47% year-over-year, while Ether is down about 40% over the same period.\n\nIf Bitcoin fails to defend the $22,000 mark, it could shatter hopes of a recovery in the coming months, Bitbank crypto analyst Yuya Hasegawa wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cThe next stop will likely be around $21.4k, where its February low and November high are converging,\u201d Hasegawa wrote."

Bitcoin of America allegedly received approximately 20% of the money from each transaction.\n\n\"Because of Bitcoin of America's lack of safeguards, criminals around the world have used the company to receive payments and illicit funds to criminals in the U.S. and across the world. Scammers, robocallers and international organized crime groups have capitalized on the company's lack of compliance and licensing,\" Blain Forshen, director of the Secret Service, Cleveland, told Fox 8."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell 6.57% in the week from Feb. 24 to March 3, trading at US$22,362 at 8:30 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. Ether slid 5.06% in the same period to change hands at US$1,565.\n\n2McLg0Jp hKdSIirH3XdnMD3PvjzNR S2H6vLL9XEOjAdH2Doet7RAqKFa7MS557i2UWnnzAl2QePUnWs1aF95Z59V4rDYUbCkH8 wtQJzRnkcxCR9 amDHr0CG 5ZzYKL8ruHjMa7fvol2wP Umve4\n\n\u201cBitcoin tested the US$22,300 mark this week, the important level I highlighted during my previous analysis. This level holds strong support for both static and dynamic,\u201d wrote Aziz Kenjaev, head of partnerships at decentralized crypto derivatives exchange GammaX, to Forkast.\n\n\u201cSee also the rebound of Bitcoin from US$22,030 backed by a dynamic support and a lower border of the parallel channel of Jan. 18,\u201d wrote Kenjaev, referring to the chart below.\n\n2HpKMPlk3pnAJ\n\n\u201cBuyers will try to keep BTC price above US$22,300 today and during weekends, however next week another giant red bar might fill in the Bitcoin chart,\u201d added Kenjaev.\n\nColin Johnson, chief executive officer and co-founder of Freeport, a platform bringing fine art investment on-chain, expects Bitcoin\u2019s crab walk to continue.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect a pumping BTC price in the near term \u2013 even with the upcoming Yuga Labs launch. As has been the trend, we can expect to see BTC continue its crab walk between US$22,000-24,000 until the uncertainty surrounding macro elements begins to clear,\u201d wrote Johnson.\n\n\u201cThe markets are likely to feel just like March weather \u2013 uninviting and finicky. We appear to be squarely in the doldrums with very little on the horizon indicating a long-term recovery of the stock market. Crypto will follow suit, unless a significant change in the perception of crypto assets as hedges against inflation begins to take hold amongst large players, which remains a possibility,\u201d added Johnson.\n\nJonas Betz, a Germany-based crypto analyst, told Forkast that Mt. Gox exchange\u2019s upcoming bankruptcy repayments decision could contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s crab walk.\n\n\u201cDue to fears of a Bitcoin dump because of the Mt. Gox bankruptcy redemptions as well as a tense macroeconomic situation, I expect Bitcoin to continue its sideways trend in the coming week. Though pessimism among market participants is increasing, a break below US$20,000 is unlikely, as Bitcoin has shown only little reaction to bad news in recent weeks. I expect the bitcoin price to continue its sideways trend in the range between US$21,000-25,000,\u201d wrote Betz.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe global crypto market cap stood at US$1.03 trillion on Friday at 8:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, falling 5.5% from US$1.09 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$431 billion market cap represented 42.1% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$191 billion accounted for 18.7%.\n\nOver 69% of Bitcoin supply was in profit on March 2, according to on-chain data provider CryptoQuant, up from 49% on Jan. 1. The higher this percentage, the more Bitcoin holders are in profit, increasing the probability of investors selling to take profit.\n\n4aGVzoM2PeWyrx0CZV4bkykgE hPns8vvPfobsSmNNtNhd82cLwMHb4M941 b2Oo9daXIzTWV\n\nInvestment management giant Morgan Stanley warned on Tuesday that the current stock market rally is a \u201cbull trap,\u201d and that \u201cMarch is a high-risk month for the bear market to resume.\u201d\n\nEvgeny Goncharov, director and blockchain advisor at crypto consulting firm BDC Consulting, said that an incoming bull trap might be possible.\n\n\u201cThe bull trap is real. Chinese money supply (US$1.7 million) in the last year influenced investing activities at the beginning of this year. It\u2019s a new narrative impacting the crypto market too. But Chinese investors copy the behavior of western investors. That\u2019s why we consider this factor reinforcement of the traditional markets\u2019 trends and could be switched to different sides,\u201d wrote Goncharov.\n\nBiggest gainers: MKR & SSV\n\nMakerDAO\u2019s governance token was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. The Mkr token rose 25.82% on the weekly chart, to trade at US$930.16 at 8:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. Maker is the largest crypto lending protocol in the decentralized finance space.\n\nThe token started picking up on March 1, following MakerDAO\u2019s proposal to enable the use of its governance token as collateral for borrowing the DAI stablecoin.\n\nSSV.Network\u2019s Ssv token was the second biggest gainer, rising 14.72% to change hands at US$44.37. SSV.Network is a project that builds distributed validator infrastructure and decentralized Ether staking products, which gained significant attention at the ETHDenver Hackathon.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin Punks exceed 1,145 ETH in daily trading volume as Bitcoin Ordinals gain traction\n\nNext week?\n\n\u201cBeware the ides of March. Bitcoin is likely to end the month around or possibly just below US$21,000. Below US$20,000 means a possible re-testing of the US$16,000-17,000 floor. Above US$25,000 is possible only on breakout macroeconomic news, or a significant sentiment shift against the US Dollar because of runaway inflation,\u201d wrote Freeport\u2019s Johnson.\n\n\u201cConfidence reports on inflation, interest rates, the war in Ukraine, China, and possibly the outcome of the student debt relief decision in the Supreme court,\u201d will be the main factors driving markets, according to Johnson. \u201cRelief could drive the perception that young Americans will push their newly found \u2018cash\u2019 into the crypto ecosystem,\u201d he added.\n\nGammaX\u2019s Kenjaev warned of more potential volatility next week, due to the upcoming testimony of U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s price is also driven by the gains and losses of its major trading counterpart \u2013 the U.S. Dollar\u2026 We are expecting high volatility during the testament of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Tuesday and Wednesday. And for the rest of the week we are expecting a slight roller coaster since the important data on job openings, NFP (nonfarm payroll report) and unemployment will be released,\u201d wrote Kenjaev, adding that any developments regarding Paxos and Kraken will be significant.\n\n\u201cI am expecting a retest of US$22,800-22,900 by Monday and another drop to US$21,450 next week. The key level to watch is US$22,300. If there is a daily close below this level, then US$21,450 is the next important support to watch. Although I still stand for a drop to US$19,000, this level to me would be a significant booster level for the next major uptrend,\u201d wrote Kenjaev.\n\nAlex Reinhardt, the founder of PLC Ultima, a firm building crypto infrastructure for mass adoption, said that the crypto market is mainly driven by the U.S. economy and growing consumer prices.\n\n\u201cSo far, data on the state of the American economy and the growth of consumer prices in the U. S. have a more significant impact on the crypto market and the price of Bitcoin. The PCE index published last week turned out to be worse than expected, and this negative effect immediately affected the crypto market. The risks that the Fed will decide to raise the key rate by 50 basis points instead of 25, as previously expected, have grown after the publication of the household consumption index,\u201d wrote Reinhardt, adding that \u201cBitcoin Ordinals definitely cannot compare with the expected effect of the FOMC press conference scheduled for March 22.\u201d\n\nBetz the analyst expects more bearish momentum in March. \u201cI can see Bitcoin ending March at US$22,000. The reason for my bearish price target is that inflation has picked up and it is likely that the Fed funds rate will be increased after the FOMC meeting on March 21-22. An important price level to watch is the psychological levels of US$20,000 and US$25,000. A breach of either of these levels will lead to a major price move,\u201d wrote Betz.\n\nSee related article: Industry reacts: US cracks down on crypto, India calls for regulatory collaboration"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the original cryptocurrency with the largest market cap, continues to lead the crypto market \u2014 to both the green and red. Even though the crypto space gave birth to quite a few projects, the rest of the herd is no match for the brainchild of Satoshi Nakamoto for financial transactions.\n\nThe unique unspent transaction output (UTXO) model used for the Bitcoin blockchain enables BTC to act much like a paper currency, resulting in superior security and robustness as a peer-to-peer currency. Especially compared to the bank-account-like model that Ethereum-based DeFi solutions typically adopt. As the pioneering cryptocurrency, Bitcoin presents massive liquidity, but Ethereum-based DeFi solutions have yet to develop a secure and effective way to tap into that.\n\nDeFi already met Bitcoin, but there was a catch\n\nWith the introduction of the Taproot upgrade, which enabled the implementation of smart contracts, DeFi found its route to the Bitcoin base layer for the first time. However, it started on the wrong foot: As the Taproot upgrade allowed people to bypass the initial 80-byte limit on the Bitcoin blockchain, people wasted no time in uploading all sorts of digital properties, including images, NFT-like inscribed assets and more, clogging up the base layer with unnecessary digital junk and possibly making Satoshi Nakamoto cringe.\n\nBitcoin needs its own layer-2 DeFi ecosystem that expands the use of BTC putting no additional pressure on the base layer, and that\u2019s where Mintlayer comes in. Mintlayer is an L2 solution rooted in the established network of the Bitcoin blockchain. Similar to how the Lightning Network solved Bitcoin payments at scale, Mintlayer is poised to bring decentralized finance to Bitcoin\u2019s toolkit, without compromising the Bitcoin community\u2019s principles.\n\nImproved security through atomic swaps\n\nAs the massively damaging DeFi hacks and exploits from last year proved, trying to use Bitcoin in a non-native blockchain via wrapped tokens or cross-chain bridges was a bad idea. After years of attacks and more than $2.5 billion in user funds lost, it is clear that the risk of becoming an attack surface is just too high for any token bridges to grow reliably.\n\nMintlayer, on the other hand, uses atomic swaps to allow a 1:1 transaction from native Bitcoin to tokens on the Mintlayer blockchain, effectively removing the need for any wrapped tokens or token bridges. This way, Bitcoin owners can use their BTC to give different DeFi use cases a go.\n\nEnrico Rubboli, co-creator of Mintlayer, explained why DeFi should be in the vizors of traditional financial institutions:\n\n\u201cDeFi is a trust-minimizing technology. When code replaces humans, it is incorruptible, taking human error out of the equation as much as possible. We are still early for that, both in terms of regulation and technology, but this is why Mintlayer exists.\u201d\n\nTo facilitate quick adoption, Mintlayer spent 2022 developing a mobile wallet and an extension for internet browsers as well as integrating with Lightning Network. Following the launch of its native token ML, Mintlayer aims to have its mainnet ready by the third quarter of 2023. Mintlayer\u2019s mission is to build a protocol with the least amount of friction for Bitcoin users to create the applications they need and use platforms built by others.\n\nThe team also announced the Mintlayer ecosystem fund to accelerate the growth of a DeFi ecosystem centered around Bitcoin. Projects bringing value to the Mintlayer ecosystem can also benefit from various grants the ecosystem fund provides. The fund helps projects and startups in different stages of development to find blockchain investors and like-minded stakeholders to push the space to new horizons.\n\nLearn more about Mintlayer"

        "content": "What happened\n\nMany cryptocurrencies continued to slide today as investors digest the fallout from the crypto bank Silvergate Capital (SI) and evaluate its ability to stay in business.\n\nThe price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC 1.55%), is trading 4.3% lower than late yesterday afternoon as of 10 a.m. ET today. The price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH -1.35%), is roughly 4.1% lower, while the price of the meme token Shiba Inu (SHIB -1.01%) is down 5.8%.\n\nSo what\n\nAfter the market closed Wednesday, Silvergate submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stating that it would need to delay the filing of its annual report as it analyzed the impact of several events on its business.\n\nSilvergate operates a real-time payments network for U.S. dollars that crypto exchanges and institutional traders use to better facilitate crypto transactions. The network is very helpful for the crypto ecosystem because cryptocurrencies trade around the clock and the U.S. banking system operates on a lag.\n\nBut the scandal-laden bankruptcy of FTX, which had been a large client of Silvergate, prompted a bank run, and Silvergate saw nearly 70% of its digital-asset-related deposits leave the bank in the fourth quarter of 2022. The bank had to sell a big chunk of its bond portfolio, while it traded at a loss, to cover the deposit outflows, wiping out a big chunk of shareholder equity. Furthermore, many investors believed Silvergate could face some severe regulatory action due to its relationship with FTX, and media outlets have reported that the U.S. Department of Justice is looking into the bank.\n\nIn its filing with the SEC, Silvergate said it continued to sell bonds at a loss in January and February and that its capital levels could now be below regulatory requirements as a result. Furthermore, Silvergate is also currently assessing the impact of regulatory inquiries and investigations into the bank. All of this has led the bank to assess its \"ability to continue as a going concern.\"\n\nYesterday, some of Silvergate's major clients, such as Coinbase (COIN -1.72%), announced they would stop using the bank, and Silvergate's stock fell a whopping 58% and is down nearly an additional 11% today, trading around $5 per share. Although most cryptocurrencies fell yesterday, they held up decently given the news. Today, however, investors seem more worried.\n\n\"The bearish turn could certainly be a delayed reaction to Silvergate's ongoing issues,\" said Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko, according to CNBC. \"Many large exchanges and market makers partner with Silvergate for fast transactions between entities, and any halt in activity could have an impact on global crypto liquidity.\"\n\n\"In addition, there are now wider industry concerns that U.S. regulators are trying to cut off further banking relationships between crypto firms and FDIC-insured banks,\" Markus Thielen, the head of research at digital asset platform Matrixport, told Cointelegraph.\n\nNow what\n\nFederal banking regulators have issued multiple statements warning banks about the risks associated with certain crypto activities, and another large crypto bank, Signature Bank (SBNY), has also scaled back its crypto activities.\n\nThe news is of industrywide interest because services provided by Silvergate help exchanges, traders, and others easily change dollars to crypto and vice versa.\n\nI still think the largest cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, will be here for a long time and that people will continue to be able to swap them for fiat currencies. However, I have no interest in meme tokens like Shiba Inu right now."

Bitcoin (BTC) fell 4.5% to $22,386, whereas Ethereum (ETH) was below the $1,600 level. BTC volume in the last 24 hours stood at approximately $26.01 billion, rising 12.56% in the last 24 hours.\"In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies dropped in value due to the release of US manufacturing data and uncertainties concerning access to banking services for crypto companies in the US. Furthermore, the fallout of Silvergate has also played a role in the decline. Bitcoin is at its lowest point in about two weeks and is trading below $23,000 at $22,300,\" Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex, said.Other top tokens were also trading lower on Friday. Litecoin declined by 8%. Dogecoin , Solana, Cardano, and BNB were also trading with cuts.

Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is currently 42.09%, a decrease of 0.23% over the day, according to CoinMarketCap.\"Big crypto-specific development to watch out for is the unfolding of events at Silvergate, as the crypto-friendly bank failed to file its annual report to the SEC, and its stock has come under heavy selling pressure. Markets are watching with bated breath to see if there's another domino left to fall post the FTX fiasco,\" Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead at CoinSwitch, said.Rajagopal Menon, Vice President at WazirX, said, \"Major market indicators point to a neutral sentiment.

        "content": "UK banks are getting tougher on customers using crypto. In the past week, two of the country\u2019s biggest banks\u2014Nationwide and HSBC\u2014cracked down by applying daily limits for buyers or restricting credit cards from making crypto purchases.\n\nThese two banks aren\u2019t the only ones: a number of banks over the past year have got tougher. Some took a tougher stance following the collapse of mega digital asset exchange FTX back in November.\n\nAccording to most U.K. high-street banks with limits, the crackdown is to protect investors from cryptocurrency fraud. \u201cWe want to do everything we can to protect our customers and we feel that limiting payments to cryptocurrency exchanges is the best way to make sure your money stays safe,\u201d Santander says.\n\nSo what are the current rules? Here is the low-down on which banks are crypto-friendly for the retail investor.\n\nNationwide\n\nBeen offered a cryptocurrency investment opportunity? If someone offers you a low risk, high reward crypto investment, be cautious. This could be a scam. Many cryptocurrency investments aren\u2019t regulated, so you\u2019re unlikely to get your money back if something goes wrong. pic.twitter.com/bgb3PLbAHT \u2014 Nationwide Building Society (@AskNationwide) October 15, 2021\n\nMajor high-street bank Nationwide this week said it was setting up new restrictions to \u201chelp protect you and to try and keep your money safe.\u201d Customers can no longer buy crypto with credit cards and with debit cards, and there are daily limits of \u00a35,000 ($5,965).\n\nHSBC\n\nHSBC this week also imposed tougher rules. Now, customers cannot buy any digital assets from exchanges using credit cards. Those who bank with HSBC can buy crypto with a debit card through certain U.K.-regulated platforms\u2014but not exchanges like Coinbase.\n\nThe banking giant has said it has no interest in Bitcoin and has banned customers from buying stocks of companies with Bitcoin exposure.\n\nStory continues\n\nLloyds\n\nLloyds allows its clients to buy crypto via U.K.-regulated platforms and make withdrawals from exchanges such as Coinbase\u2014but only using debit cards.\n\nIt was one of the first banks in the U.K. to stop its clients from buying crypto with credit cards back in 2018.\n\nNatWest\n\nNatWest Group CEO Alison Rose last month said that the bank had \u201ctaken a pretty hard line as a bank on crypto.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2021, the bank barred corporate customers who deal in cryptocurrencies. That means companies like crypto exchanges with a base in the U.K. cannot hold accounts at NatWest.\n\nThe FCA Has 5 Entirely Reasonable Concerns About Cryptocurrency\n\nBut right now, according to the bank, that \u201cdoesn't mean that we block cryptocurrency payments altogether but we will restrict payments to cryptocurrency exchanges that present the highest risk of financial harm.\u201d\n\nYou can use a NatWest account to buy digital assets from exchanges such as Coinbase. Amounts are limited, according to the bank, though NatWest has not revealed exactly by how much.\n\nBarclays\n\nBarclays bank does not allow customers to buy or sell crypto through its online banking platform. Would-be investors can buy crypto via a regulated, FCA-approved broker, though.\n\nBarclays was one of the U.K. banks that stopped customers making payments to crypto exchange Binance in 2021 after the British regulatory body FCA issued a warning over exchange.\n\nSantander\n\nHigh-street bank Santander announced last year that it would be limiting U.K. customers from making large crypto transactions. As it stands, those who bank with Santander can make single transactions of \u00a31,000, with a total limit of \u00a33,000 in any rolling 30-day period.\n\nA crypto trader who banks with Santander told Decrypt that his account was closed without warning after making withdrawals from Coinbase.\n\nWise\n\nFormerly known as TransferWise, Wise does not deal in cryptocurrencies at all. And you can\u2019t use an account to buy digital assets from an exchange. But Wise customers can receive money to their account from a platform that deals with crypto if it is regulated in the EU or UK.\n\nMonzo\n\nYou can buy cryptocurrency on big, established exchanges such as Coinbase (but not Binance) with popular challenger bank Monzo, but it \u201cmay block a small number of transactions based on risk.\u201d The bank does not say how big or small these transactions are.\n\nStarling\n\nChallenger bank Starling is one of the strictest: it has banned customers from all crypto-related payments. \u201cWe consider crypto activity to be high risk,\u201d the bank said in November. Starling clients told Decrypt that the move was sudden.\n\nHi there \ud83d\udc4b We always review our position in relation to financial crime. We consider crypto activity to be high risk. We\u2019ve taken the decision to prevent all card payments to crypto merchants and to implement further restrictions on outgoing and incoming transfers. \u2014 Starling Bank (@StarlingBank) November 22, 2022\n\nRevolut\n\nThis challenger bank is the most crypto-friendly of them all: users can buy, sell, and store a number of digital assets via the mobile banking app. And just last month, the bank launched a staking service for Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, and Tezos."

        "title": "Bitcoin Miner Capitulation Has Been 'Completely Different' This Cycle: CoinShares - Decrypt",
        "content": "In brief Compared to previous bear markets, Bitcoin miners are faring much differently this time around.\n\nChapter 11 bankruptcies are completely different than abrupt shutdowns like those in China.\n\nAs for green shoots, one analyst is pointing to next year's halving event.\n\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA cycle of miner capitulation can be observed throughout Bitcoin\u2019s history.\n\nWhen times are good, miners stockpile their Bitcoin, restricting the supply of new coins during high demand and serving as an additional multiplier to the general upward price trend.\n\nWhen times are bad, like the past few months, miners sell their Bitcoin treasuries\u2014usually to cover operating expenses when mining is less profitable, like when Bitcoin\u2019s price is low, or to pay off over-leveraged positions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack in June 2022, for example, a report by crypto analysts at Arcane Research revealed that during the month of May, publicly-traded Bitcoin miners like Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain sold more Bitcoin than they mined\u2014a stark reversal of fortunes from the first four months of the year when the same miners sold less than a third of their earnings.\n\nThis cycle\u2019s been different, though, CoinShares Bitcoin research lead Christopher Bendiksen told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cWhen you had a much less efficient capital market it was probably a lot less orderly and we saw that manifested previously as these big pullbacks in difficulty,\u201d he said, comparing the current network to when the industry was less established. \u201cThat just hasn\u2019t happened this time, even though we\u2019ve had spectacular bankruptcies and a bunch of operations struggling.\u201d\n\nDuring capitulation cycles, miners running inefficient or overleveraged operations drop off the network\u2014usually, this has meant that they switch off their machines.\n\nThis can lead to those \u201cbig pullbacks\" that Bendikson mentioned, when it briefly becomes easier for mining hardware to mine Bitcoin, before a rebalancing period during which more mining hardware gets deployed, lifting mining difficulty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis time, though, except for a brief period due to poor weather in the United States, firms haven\u2019t been shutting off their machines.\n\nThis had made the latest capitulation cycle unique, shedding more light on how the mining market is quickly evolving.\n\nChapter 11 makes markets different\n\nThe recent bankruptcies haven\u2019t had a significant effect on mining difficulty because, this time round, the majority of miners on the network were based in the U.S., said Bendiksen.\n\nBefore China\u2019s 2021 crackdown on crypto, the bulk of the network\u2019s hash rate (computing power) was located outside the U.S., predominantly in mid-sized, at least by today\u2019s standards, private mining farms in China.\n\nThese farms dropped off the network when authorities cut their power, leading to a sudden 17% drop in the network\u2019s hash rate.\n\nThis crackdown was far more unorderly for miners, with physical locations abruptly closing down, taking down a host of mining equipment with them.\n\nThat\u2019s just not been the case for the more well-ordered bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n\u201cEither the shutdowns that have happened have been outgrown by new hash rate, more contracted machines coming on, or the machines haven\u2019t been shut off,\u201d the CoinShares researcher told Decrypt. \u201cIt looks completely different from other cycles.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConsider, for instance, Core Scientific. In December, the firm officially filed for bankruptcy, citing the ongoing market conditions.\n\nCritically, though, the miner said that its operations would continue. The firm also penned several financing agreements to do that, further highlighting the differences between swift regulatory action and the slow-moving bankruptcy process.\n\nAll eyes on Bitcoin\u2019s halving\n\nBitcoin prices are still 66% lower than their record set back in 2021 and there may very well be more financial difficulties down the road. According to Bendikson, the market may need to wait until next year for more green shoots.\n\nIn a research note, Bendiksen pointed to the 2024 halving event, which he said has historically been tied to bull markets. The Bitcoin halving is when the network cuts the amount of rewards that miners receive for their work in half.\n\n\u201cHistorically, there has been a recurring tendency for the halvings to be closely followed by bull markets, leading to the now famed four-year bull/bear cycles in bitcoin price,\u201d he wrote in a research note.\n\nData from Coinwarz puts that event at roughly April 26, 2024.\n\nRegardless of price, if the industry has learned anything from this latest spiral, it\u2019s that the mining industry has matured by leaps and bounds in the last few years."

        "content": "In a \u201cbase case\u201d scenario, Galaxy Digital\u2019s research unit has tipped the burgeoning Bitcoin nonfungible token (NFT) market to hit a $4.5 billion market cap by March 2025.\n\nBitcoin NFTs, or Ordinals, have attracted significant attention since the Ordinals protocol launched in late January, enabling users to inscribe data such as images, PDFs, video and audio onto individual satoshis \u2014 each representing 0.00000001 Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nNFT giants such as Yuga Labs have even jumped in on the hype. On Feb. 28, the $4 billion firm behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club announced a Bitcoin-based NFT project dubbed \u201cTwelveFold\u201d in a notable recognition of the Ordinals movement.\n\nIn a new report published on March 3, Galaxy researchers analyzed the potential growth of Bitcoin NFTs, making estimations \u201cconservatively based on the current size of Ethereum\u2019s NFT market\u201d and its growth rate over the past few years.\n\n\u201cWhile there are notable differences between inscriptions and NFTs, it\u2019s fair to say that a native on-chain ecosystem for NFTs has emerged on Bitcoin in a way that was never before possible, and its usage has been exploding.\u201d\n\nThe report provided three market cap predictions based on the firm\u2019s analysis, covering bear, base and bull case scenarios.\n\nLooking at Galaxy\u2019s baseline analysis, the report outlined that if Bitcoin NFTs can \u201cexpand to mainstream NFT culture like PFPs [Profile Pictures], memes and utility projects,\u201d the market capitalization should increase to $4.5 billion.\n\nThe researchers also noted that the projection of $4.5 billion is also based on the \u201crapid development in inscription awareness coupled with the marketplace/wallet infrastructure already out today.\u201d\n\nFantastic research piece by @intangiblecoins at @galaxyhq on the rise of Bitcoin Ordinals:\n\n\n\n- $4.5B base case market\n\n- Help with Bitcoin's fee market\n\n- Increase the design space for smart contracts\n\n\n\nRead more here \u2014 Dan Held (@danheld) March 3, 2023\n\nIn a bear case, in which Bitcoin NFTs don\u2019t creep into the mainstream NFT market and pry market share away from Ethereum, Galaxy estimated that Bitcoin NFTs can still reach a market cap of $1.5 billion based on the current level of interest and supporting infrastructure.\n\nRelated: Total crypto market cap takes a hit amid Silvergate Bank crisis\n\nOn the bullish side of things, Galaxy researchers estimate that the Bitcoin NFT market could reach around $10 billion if it provides strong competition to Ethereum NFTs while providing unique use cases.\n\nEstimated Bitcoin NFT market cap. Source: Galaxy Digital\n\nAt the time of the report, more than 250,000 Ordinals have hit the market. Highlighting the significance and utility of Bitcoin NFTs, the researchers noted that:\n\n\u201cThe addition of sizeable data storage with strong availability assurances opens up a variety of use cases, many of which are only beginning to be explored, including things like new types of decentralized software or Bitcoin scaling techniques. Even the NFT use case alone, though, has the potential to dramatically widen the scope of Bitcoin\u2019s cultural impact.\u201d"

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nInterest in bridging bitcoin (BTC) to the Avalanche smart contract blockchain (BTC.b) continues to swell as the supply of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), the largest wrapped version of bitcoin on Ethereum, dwindles.\n\nOn Thursday, over 2,000 BTC ($44 million) was ported to Avalanche, the largest single-day BTC.b mint on record, according to data sourced from pseudonymous analyst 0xAcid's dashboard on Dune Analytics. That has lifted the total circulating supply of BTC.b to 8,572.\n\nAccording to 0xAcid, half of the bitcoin minted on Thursday has been moved to BENQI Finance. BENQI Finance is an Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, which allows users to lend, borrow and earn additional yields from digital assets.\n\nIn June 2022, Avalanche added support for bitcoin on its cross-chain bridge, allowing BTC holders to deploy their coins in the Avalanche-based decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem to generate extra yield. BTC.b has seen impressive growth since then, surpassing the number of coins held in the Lightning Network.\n\nA crypto bridge is a tool that facilitates interactions between the two economically and technologically separate blockchains. Bridges became a target of hackers last year, accounting for about 70% of the total exploits in the crypto industry last year, according to forensics firm Chainalysis.\n\nBTC.b on Avalanche bridge (Dune Analytics)\n\nThe record BTC.b mint comes as the WBTC supply fell by 15% to 153,164 in February, reaching the lowest since March 2021. Apparently, bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network, a well-known WBTC holder, redeemed a large amount of WBTC, causing a sharp drop in the token's supply.\n\nWBTC, issued by Bitgo, is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum network with its price pegged 1:1 with bitcoin. The token's supply peaked at 285,000 in April last year and has been falling ever since.\n\nThe Avalanche community considers BTC.b a better option than WBTC, considering Avalanche offers users the ability to mint and redeem BTC.b anytime with the bridge in a non-custodial browser extension Core, eliminating the need for intermediaries. It provides more control to users, unlike WBTC, which relies on merchants to initiate the process of minting and burning.\n\nStory continues\n\n7/ Adoption in this case has been spurred due to a superior product offering.$BTC.b offers users:\n\n\n\n-Seamless transfers between Bitcoin and @avalancheavax\n\n- Cost effective yield on BTC reserves\n\n- Protection from price volatility often seen on WBTC. \u2014 Emperor Osmo\ud83e\uddea (@Flowslikeosmo) February 21, 2023\n\nAccording to Emperor Osmo, an anonymous writer for Cosmos-based automated market maker Osmosis, the investors in AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, are yet to take notice of BTC's growing use in DeFI, as evidenced by BTC.b's rising supply.\n\n\"Over $200M of BTC has been bridged to Avalanche [to date]. The BTC DeFi narrative is definitely not priced in for AVAX,\" Osmo tweeted early Friday.\n\nAt press time, AVAX traded nearly 6% lower on the day, near $16, the lowest since Jan. 20. The cryptocurrency has seen a 50% appreciation in its market value this year, per CoinDesk data."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe emergent Bitcoin NFT ecosystem\u2014practically non-existent just months ago\u2014could balloon to $4.5 billion in market size by 2025, according to a report released Friday by Galaxy Research.\n\nAnalysts anticipate that the Bitcoin Ordinal frenzy of the last two months is no blip. They project demand for the ability to store NFTs on the world\u2019s oldest and most established blockchain will only grow in the coming years. Galaxy researchers say that even by summer of this year an entire infrastructure of products and services designed to cater to this growing market will be fully developed.\n\n\u201cIn just two months, wallets have already begun to offer the necessary support to improve user experience and marketplaces are already emerging,\u201d the report said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn late January, a project called Ordinals launched NFT-like capability on Bitcoin, allowing users to inscribe satoshis\u2014the smallest unit of Bitcoin, representing 0.00000001 BTC\u2014with unique data such as images and video. While that inscription process can be time intensive, and the process of putting those assets on the Bitcoin chain is costly, the project became an immediate success.\n\nThe number of Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions made since the end of January surpassed 200,000 earlier this week; as of this writing, over 267,000 have been made, according to public blockchain data aggregated on Dune Analytics.\n\nYuga Labs, the $4 billion company behind dominant Ethereum NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club, announced on Monday its first-ever Bitcoin-based NFT project, signaling the spread of Ordinals\u2019 appeal to the top echelons of the established, predominantly Ethereum-based NFT ecosystem.\n\n\u201cYuga\u2019s involvement [in Bitcoin NFTs] will push other artists to inscribe, which in turn will likely bring the major NFT marketplaces like OpenSea,\u201d Friday\u2019s report concluded.\n\nThe Bitcoin NFT market will likely look distinct from competitors though, due to the cost of inscribing on the network. For example, to inscribe 10,000 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs on the Bitcoin network would cost roughly $229,000 by Galaxy\u2019s estimations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCreators will likely wish to avoid such eyebrow-raising costs; Yuga\u2019s debut Bitcoin collection, TwelveFold, for example, is a limited series of just 300 artworks. For that reason, Galaxy predicts that Bitcoin will become the home of much rarer, \u201chigh quality\u201d art projects, and valuable one-of-ones, while other chains like Ethereum will continue to host massive, multi-thousand piece PFP collections at much lower costs to creators.\n\nGalaxy\u2019s rosy outlook for Bitcoin NFTs, though, is contingent on the continued success of the broader NFT market.\n\n\u201cIf the NFT ecosystem broadly does not continue to grow, then demand for Bitcoin-native NFTs will be limited,\u201d analysts wrote Friday.\n\nThe market has struggled to recover to the all-time highs of early 2022, just before Terra\u2019s collapse triggered the current crypto winter and cratered NFT prices and demand. NFT sales just notched their best month since the bear market kicked off. But that surge in trading volume is largely coming from controversial trading practices on the emergent Blur NFT marketplace, which encourages users to engage in high-volume trades in exchange for valuable loyalty rewards.\n\nBlur\u2019s sudden rise, overtaking the once-dominant OpenSea, has spurred a crisis in the established NFT market. Creator royalties, once the cornerstone of NFTs\u2019 value proposition, have been slashed by NFT marketplaces in a race to attract customers from competitors. Royalties, typically set between 5% and 10% of a sale price and paid by the seller, are how most NFT projects generate revenue. Nearly all NFT marketplaces have now made paying such fees optional, which is attractive for traders since they now pocket greater profits on each sale, but devastating for creators who lack other sources of revenue.\n\nThose hopeful that a major new NFT market like Bitcoin could change that paradigm may not be in luck. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t yet meaningfully support smart contracts, meaning there\u2019s no way for emergent Bitcoin NFT marketplaces to enforce creator royalties, or to blocklist rivals who fail to honor them.\n\n\u201cThe broader trend in the NFT ecosystem is a race to zero on royalties, or complete non-enforcement, and nothing about inscriptions is likely to alter that course,\u201d Galaxy\u2019s report said."

Source: Bloomberg\n\nWhile the problem is not as severe as during the pandemic, the survey shows inflationary pressure has not gone away despite the Fed\u2019s aggressive rate hikes.\n\n\u201cRecent data suggest that consumer spending isn\u2019t slowing that much, that the labor market continues to run unsustainably hot, and that inflation is not coming down as fast as I thought,\u201d noted Fed Governor Christopher Waller, adding:\n\n\u201cIf those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more.\u201c\n\nBank of America Global Research anticipates the Fed to raise the interest rate to almost 6% from the current 4.5\u20134.75% range. Theoretically, it should renew investors\u2019 demand for the dollar by putting downside pressure on \u201criskier\u201d assets like Bitcoin.\n\nDXY chart paints inverse head-and-shoulders\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the U.S. Dollar Index looks poised to rise by more than 4.5% in the coming months due to the formation of a classic bullish reversal pattern.\n\nDubbed inverse-head-and-shoulders, the pattern develops when the price forms three troughs below a common resistance line (neckline), with the middle trough (head) deeper than the other two (left and right shoulders).\n\nDXY daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAn inverse-head-and-shoulders pattern resolves after the price breaks above the neckline and rises by as much as the maximum height between the pattern\u2019s lowest level and the neckline.\n\nIf the DXY successfully breaks above its neckline of 105.25, the likelihood of an extended recovery toward 109.75 in 2023 will be higher.\n\nBitcoin price to retest $20K?\n\nThe stronger dollar prospects come as Bitcoin bulls fail to sustain the price rally in breaking the $25,000 technical resistance level. BTC\u2019s price has tumbled by around 13% since, with macro headwinds being one of the primary reasons.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, concerns over Silvergate and potential ramifications for the industry have also kept the price in check in the past few days.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price slides 5% in 60 minutes amid Silvergate uncertainty\n\n\u201cAny liquidity concerns will have a direct impact on market conditions and may affect the access and availability of some client funds,\u201d warned John Toro, head of trading at digital-asset exchange Independent Reserve.\n\nCrypto headwinds are starting to pile up, and may explain the reason for the recent sell-off.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Mt.

        "title": "Bitcoin is for Republicans, Ethereum is for Democrats - Fortune",
        "content": "Greetings from Colorado\u2019s capital, where more than 20,000 Ethereum enthusiasts have descended to celebrate ETHDenver, a multi-day extravaganza dedicated to demos, workshops, and a whole lot of hoopla related to their favorite blockchain. As usual, many of this year\u2019s attendees turned up wearing rainbows or outlandish animal costumes\u2014a colorful pageant that felt especially striking given that this year\u2019s ETHDenver is taking place at the city\u2019s fabled stockyard and rodeo grounds, which is adorned by images of cowboys, Budweiser, and other icons typically associated with red America.\n\nI remarked on the hippie-like vibe\u2014which included a \u201czen zone\u201d and an arena full of sleepings bags for 500 Ethereum scholarship attendees to stay overnight\u2014to a 50-something crypto industry professional, who was himself dressed in a vibrant shirt and hipster glasses. He nodded and observed, \u201cBitcoin is for Republicans, Ethereum is for Democrats.\u201d It\u2019s hard to disagree. While the hardcore Bitcoin crowd is fixated with hodling and suspicion of the government, the Ethereum set is more given over to radical experimentation and eccentricity.\n\nI put this characterization to Kevin Owocki, the founder of the open software promulgator Gitcoin, who has just launched Supermodular, a venture studio that aspires to commercialize a wide variety of Ethereum innovations. He described the political labels as \u201cvery reductionist,\u201d but conceded the broad strokes are correct. \u201cBitcoin is about red meat and guns\u2026Ethereum has rainbows and unicorns,\u201d Owocki noted.\n\nAll of this underscores the degree to which crypto culture has grown and become more diverse since the libertarian Satoshi published his famous white paper in 2008, and soon after embedded a warning about central bank profligacy in the first block of Bitcoin. Today, the two most important blockchains have come to embody very different political tribes, both of which offer new and distinct ideas, but also overlap with broader progressive and conservative cultural movements.\n\nFor the thousands of mostly young people packed into the stockyard building, however, politics was far from their minds. They were instead consumed by the prospects for the next phase of Ethereum, which successfully pulled off a very difficult switch to the environmentally friendly proof of stake last year, and is on track to introduce a host of other updates that will make the blockchain faster and easier to use. In May, it will be Bitcoin\u2019s turn to be the center of the crypto universe when its devotees gather in Miami Beach for an extravaganza of their own. We\u2019ll have a dispatch from there too, but for now, it\u2019s enough to observe that\u2014even after one of the industry\u2019s toughest years ever\u2014crypto and its colorful culture are more entrenched than ever.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCoinbase purchased digital asset manager One River in a bet on future institutional demand for crypto.

        "title": "10 Factors That Are Influencing Bitcoin Value - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "10 factors that influence Bitcoin value are listed in this article, supply and demand is the primary factor.\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that has experienced significant volatility since its inception in 2009. The value of Bitcoin is influenced by several factors that can cause fluctuations in its price. Here are ten factors that influence Bitcoin value:\n\n1. Supply and Demand: Similar to other currencies and assets, the basic economic principle of supply and demand plays a crucial role in determining Bitcoin\u2019s price. The scarcity of Bitcoin, with a maximum supply of 21 million, and the increasing demand for it are factors that can influence its value.\n\n2. Institutional Adoption: As more institutions and companies adopt Bitcoin, its value can increase. The involvement of large corporations such as Tesla and MicroStrategy has already had a positive impact on Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\n3. Regulatory Changes: Any changes in government regulations or policies that impact Bitcoin\u2019s use or acceptance can affect its value. News of potential regulation or crackdowns on cryptocurrencies can lead to a drop in their price.\n\n4. News and Market Sentiment: Bitcoin\u2019s value can also be influenced by market sentiment and the media\u2019s portrayal of it. Positive news, such as a major company accepting Bitcoin as payment, can increase its value, while negative news can decrease its value.\n\n5. Technological Advancements: Bitcoin is based on blockchain technology, and advancements in this field can impact its value. Improvements in the network\u2019s speed and efficiency can increase demand for Bitcoin, while technical problems can lead to a drop in its value.\n\n6. Integration with Other Technologies: Bitcoin\u2019s integration with other technologies, such as the Lightning Network, can increase its utility and value.\n\n7. Energy Consumption: The high energy consumption required for Bitcoin mining is a factor that can impact its value. News of increased regulation or pressure on Bitcoin miners to become more energy-efficient can lead to a drop in its value.\n\n8. Security Concerns: Any security concerns or hacking incidents involving Bitcoin can lead to a decrease in its value.\n\n9. Competition: The rise of other cryptocurrencies can also impact Bitcoin\u2019s value. If a new cryptocurrency gains popularity and acceptance, it can reduce demand for Bitcoin and decrease its value.\n\n10. Economic and Political Stability: Bitcoin\u2019s value can also be impacted by global economic and political instability. In times of economic uncertainty or political turmoil, Bitcoin may be viewed as a safe haven asset and see an increase in value. However, in times of stability, its value may decrease.\n\nOne of the primary reasons why cryptocurrency is influenced by external factors is because it is not yet widely adopted and integrated into the global financial system. It is still a relatively new and emerging asset class, and as such, its value can be more volatile and subject to market sentiment and news than established assets. Additionally, cryptocurrency is often subject to regulatory changes and policy decisions made by governments and financial institutions. News of potential regulatory action or crackdowns on cryptocurrencies can lead to a drop in their price.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Ras Al Khaimah\u2019s recently announced free zone for virtual asset firms will explore accepting crypto payments from companies looking into setting up their businesses in the emirate, a lawyer involved in the hub\u2019s development said.\n\nDubai-based crypto lawyer Irina Heaver told Cointelegraph that once the Ras Al Khaimah Digital Assets Oasis (RAK DAO) secures the appropriate partners, it will check out crypto payments, including Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins, for corporate registrations, office rent and other services. \u201cAfter all, cities and cantons in Switzerland have been doing this for years,\u201d she noted.\n\nHeaver further explained that suitable technology and regulatory infrastructure need to be in place for the system to work but clarified that the \u201cgroundwork has been laid.\u201d In addition, the lawyer also said that RAK DAO would explore operating full Bitcoin and lightning nodes to support the crypto payment initiative. She added:\n\n\u201cWorks are ongoing in this regard, and we welcome technology partners to join us in this journey.\u201d\n\nRAK DAO \u2014 first unveiled during Blockchain Life 2023 \u2014 would be a dedicated free zone for digital and virtual assets service providers involved in the metaverse, blockchain, utility tokens, digital wallets, nonfungible tokens, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), decentralized applications and other Web3-related businesses.\n\nHeaver said that the new free zone aims to foster regulated and non-regulated activities, disclosing that RAK DAO is exploring \u201ccreating the right legal wrapper for DAOs,\u201d among other things.\n\nRelated: UAE emirate to launch a free zone for digital and virtual asset firms\n\nThe new free zone will also serve the \u201centire chain of companies in the virtual assets space,\u201d Heaver explained. \u201cWhereas other free zones can only support segments of the industry, allowing very limited activities.\u201d She added:\n\n\u201cI have to structure multiple entities in multiple jurisdictions. This adds to costs and time and is counterproductive for entrepreneurs. Now, I see a great opportunity for founders to base their businesses in one location.\u201d\n\nThe United Arab Emirates has over 40 free zones, including the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).\n\nAs living and business costs in Ras Al Khaimah are 50% less than in Dubai, Heaver said the emirate\u2019s free zone would be a \u201cgreat point for startup companies.\u201d\n\nThe government will also assist virtual asset service providers (VASPs) with banking requirements through its own entities and relationships, the lawyer said."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $22,000, These Are The Reasons - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In the last few hours, the Bitcoin price has experienced the most violent crash since the collapse of FTX. The BTC price crashed by $1,300 within an hour and briefly fell below $22,000. Remarkably, the price drop occurred with the start of the trading day in Hong Kong.\n\nWhat Are The Reasons For The Bitcoin Price Crash?\n\nProbably the most obvious reason for the Bitcoin price crash is the uncertainty that arose yesterday around Silvergate bank, which plays a major role in providing liquidity to the market by providing a gateway to the fiat money system.\n\nThe bank delayed its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday. The resulting FUD over financial difficulties caused the bank\u2019s stock price to plummet by more than 50%. Several crypto companies, including Coinbase, Paxos, Kraken, and Galaxy Digital have subsequently terminated their business relationships with the bank.\n\nHowever, reducing the price slump, for this reason, would be too simplistic. As analyst Miles Deutscher writes via Twitter, the headwinds for the crypto market are currently piling up. In addition to Silvergate, these include Mt. Gox payouts, the Shanghai ETH unlock, a hot CPI (50bps now a real possibility), mass liquidations, and equity market weakness.\n\n\u201cNote, not all of these necessarily have a substantive basis. But nor do they need to cause de-risking. I think a combination of these factors led to a correction, with liquidations exacerbating price action,\u201d Deutscher explained.\n\nIn particular, the gigantic long liquidations likely played a significant role in causing the crash to occur as strongly as it did in such a short period of time. According to CoinGlass, long positions of over $205 million have been liquidated in the entire crypto market so far. $185 million in mostly long positions were liquidated within just 45 minutes. Bitcoin recorded the highest liquidations worth $73 million.\n\nBinance Spot Whale Responsible?\n\nAlso, analyst Skew observed conspicuity in Bitcoin spot CVD buckets and delta orders and referred to the chart below. According to the analyst, a large Binance spot sale led to the cascade of long liquidations:\n\nAs you can see here Binance Spot nuked 1 min before every other spot exchange. Significant size behind this sell off. (Someone probably exited crypto today). Key price $22K\n\nOn-chain analysis company Santiment writes that it\u2019s been more than 4 months since Bitcoin fell by 5% or more in a single hour. But an hour ago (1 am \u2013 2 am UTC), that streak was broken. \u201cA quick recovery will be dependent on how much worry the crowd shows, allowing whales to scoop weak-handed coins, \u201caccording to Santiment.\n\nAt press time, Bitcoin was trading at $22,374, down 4.3% in the last 24 hours.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nUK banks are getting tougher on customers using crypto. In the past week, two of the country\u2019s biggest banks\u2014Nationwide and HSBC\u2014cracked down by applying daily limits for buyers or restricting credit cards from making crypto purchases.\n\nThese two banks aren\u2019t the only ones: a number of banks over the past year have got tougher. Some took a tougher stance following the collapse of mega digital asset exchange FTX back in November.\n\nAccording to most U.K. high-street banks with limits, the crackdown is to protect investors from cryptocurrency fraud. \u201cWe want to do everything we can to protect our customers and we feel that limiting payments to cryptocurrency exchanges is the best way to make sure your money stays safe,\u201d Santander says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo what are the current rules? Here is the low-down on which banks are crypto-friendly for the retail investor.\n\nNationwide\n\nBeen offered a cryptocurrency investment opportunity? If someone offers you a low risk, high reward crypto investment, be cautious. This could be a scam. Many cryptocurrency investments aren\u2019t regulated, so you\u2019re unlikely to get your money back if something goes wrong. pic.twitter.com/bgb3PLbAHT \u2014 Nationwide Building Society (@AskNationwide) October 15, 2021\n\nMajor high-street bank Nationwide this week said it was setting up new restrictions to \u201chelp protect you and to try and keep your money safe.\u201d Customers can no longer buy crypto with credit cards and with debit cards, and there are daily limits of \u00a35,000 ($5,965).\n\nHSBC\n\nHSBC this week also imposed tougher rules. Now, customers cannot buy any digital assets from exchanges using credit cards. Those who bank with HSBC can buy crypto with a debit card through certain U.K.-regulated platforms\u2014but not exchanges like Coinbase.\n\nThe banking giant has said it has no interest in Bitcoin and has banned customers from buying stocks of companies with Bitcoin exposure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLloyds\n\nLloyds allows its clients to buy crypto via U.K.-regulated platforms and make withdrawals from exchanges such as Coinbase\u2014but only using debit cards.\n\nIt was one of the first banks in the U.K. to stop its clients from buying crypto with credit cards back in 2018.\n\nNatWest\n\nNatWest Group CEO Alison Rose last month said that the bank had \u201ctaken a pretty hard line as a bank on crypto.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2021, the bank barred corporate customers who deal in cryptocurrencies. That means companies like crypto exchanges with a base in the U.K. cannot hold accounts at NatWest.\n\nBut right now, according to the bank, that \u201cdoesn't mean that we block cryptocurrency payments altogether but we will restrict payments to cryptocurrency exchanges that present the highest risk of financial harm.\u201d\n\nYou can use a NatWest account to buy digital assets from exchanges such as Coinbase. Amounts are limited, according to the bank, though NatWest has not revealed exactly by how much.\n\nBarclays\n\nBarclays bank does not allow customers to buy or sell crypto through its online banking platform. Would-be investors can buy crypto via a regulated, FCA-approved broker, though.\n\nBarclays was one of the U.K. banks that stopped customers making payments to crypto exchange Binance in 2021 after the British regulatory body FCA issued a warning over exchange.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSantander\n\nHigh-street bank Santander announced last year that it would be limiting U.K. customers from making large crypto transactions. As it stands, those who bank with Santander can make single transactions of \u00a31,000, with a total limit of \u00a33,000 in any rolling 30-day period.\n\nA crypto trader who banks with Santander told Decrypt that his account was closed without warning after making withdrawals from Coinbase.\n\nWise\n\nFormerly known as TransferWise, Wise does not deal in cryptocurrencies at all. And you can\u2019t use an account to buy digital assets from an exchange. But Wise customers can receive money to their account from a platform that deals with crypto if it is regulated in the EU or UK.\n\nMonzo\n\nYou can buy cryptocurrency on big, established exchanges such as Coinbase (but not Binance) with popular challenger bank Monzo, but it \u201cmay block a small number of transactions based on risk.\u201d The bank does not say how big or small these transactions are.\n\nStarling\n\nChallenger bank Starling is one of the strictest: it has banned customers from all crypto-related payments. \u201cWe consider crypto activity to be high risk,\u201d the bank said in November. Starling clients told Decrypt that the move was sudden.\n\nHi there \ud83d\udc4b We always review our position in relation to financial crime. We consider crypto activity to be high risk. We\u2019ve taken the decision to prevent all card payments to crypto merchants and to implement further restrictions on outgoing and incoming transfers. \u2014 Starling Bank (@StarlingBank) November 22, 2022\n\nRevolut\n\nThis challenger bank is the most crypto-friendly of them all: users can buy, sell, and store a number of digital assets via the mobile banking app. And just last month, the bank launched a staking service for Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, and Tezos."

        "title": "Bullish or Bearish? A Closer Look at Bitcoin\u2019s Historical Performance in March - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "Following an ultimately flat February, eager investors are curious: what\u2019s in store for Bitcoin\u2019s price this March?\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how Bitcoin has performed each March over the last 12 years. On average, the asset\u2019s price has risen by 10% each time.\n\nBitcoin, March, and the Halving\n\nIn its earliest days, March wasn\u2019t a particularly bullish month for BTC. The cryptocurrency fell by 8.2% to just $0.79 in 2011, and went on to move 0% in March of the following year.\n\nThings changed in 2013, however, when Bitcoin closed the month at $92.19 \u2013 a whopping 176.2% rise from the start of the month. This came five months after Bitcoin\u2019s very first halving in November 2012.\n\n\u201cThe halving,\u201d refers to when Bitcoin\u2019s supply issuance per block is cut in half every 210,000 blocks, roughly once every 4 years. This creates a supply crunch that\u2019s historically triggered major bullish price momentum for Bitcoin each time it occurs.\n\nThe next five years marked a return to bearishness. From 2014 through to 2018, Bitcoin fell by 16.9%, 4%, 4.8%, 9.2%, and 32.8% in each consecutive year \u2013 the latter being Bitcoin\u2019s worst March on record. Like in 2013, Bitcoin\u2019s decline in March 2018 was in line with the halving cycle, just one year after Bitcoin\u2019s timely bull market in 2017.\n\nWhile Bitcoin saw some reprieve with a 7.4% boost in March 2019, March 2020 defied the halving schedule. Bitcoin plunged 24.8% \u2013 largely a response to \u201cBlack Thursday\u201d when stocks and crypto plummeted from growing panic around the fast-spreading coronavirus. Bitcoin had fallen by over 50% on March 12, from over $8000 to under $4000.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s third halving occurred two months later, helping spur March rallies in the following two years, including 30.2% and 5.4% boosts in 2021 and 2022 respectively.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nRecent analysis from CryptoQuant suggests that Bitcoin may be due for some selling pressure in the short term, stemming from a combination of whales and miners.\n\nSpecifically, the amount of Bitcoin both groups have been sending to exchanges is on the rise this week \u2013 a well-recognized sign that investors intend to liquidate their coins.\n\n\u201cThe BTC Whale Rato metric is high for the next day in SPOT exchanges and this rise is often due to large inflows,\u201d explained the CryptoQuant analyst abramchart. \u201cThis behavior can lead to selling pressure.\u201d\n\n"

Moreover, the value of Ethereum went below $1600 to stand at $1568, marking a 4.89 percent fall from the previous day.\n\nAs per the recent information, Silvergate Capital, a bank that specialises in cryptocurrencies, has shocked the whole cryptocurrency industry. Due to a 'crisis of confidence', the bank has postponed filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe current scenario has caused the crypto market to experience significant selling pressure. Around $50 billion in investor capital has been lost in the last few hours as a result of the over 5 percent decline in Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nAs the market struggled, the price of Solana plunged by 5.19 percent to $20.93. On the other hand, Litecoin also suffered negatively with an 8 percent fall to $89.11. The reduction in the market further led to a fall in Cardano's value by 6 percent to stand at $0.335050. This decrease was continued in XRP and Monero by 3.42 percent and 4.44 percent, respectively. The value of Avalache tumbled 7 percent to trade at $16, along with noticed lows in Cosmos of 6 percent to $11.86.\n\nOn 3 March, the global crypto market cap decreased by 4.59 percent to $1.02 trillion in the past 24 hours.

Contrarily, the top losers were dYdX, Frax Share , Stacks, and Conflux.\n\nMeme coins plunge\n\nOn Friday, the value of meme coins plunged. Shiba Inu recorded a slip of 6.29 percent to $0.000011. The value of Dogecoin fell 7 percent to $0.075340. This continued in Dogelon Mars with a 6.50 percent decrease.\n\nMetaverse tokens in the red\n\nA majority of the top metaverse tokens plunged.

        "title": "Best Bitcoin Ordinals Wallets out There - Crypto Times",
        "content": "Bitcoin is beginning to emerge as an NFT ecosystem. Ordinals is a Bitcoin blockchain protocol that allows users to create one-of-a-kind digital assets. This protocol requires a taproot wallet address. Users can mint and trade NFTs on the blockchain with this new technology.\n\nHowever, interacting with the blockchain and acquiring an Ordinal can be a slow, murky, and centralized process. Because of the growing demand for more user-friendly interfaces for those seeking Ordinals, web3 developers have stepped in to fill the void.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nBitcoin Ordinals are unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that represent a specific ordinal number on the Bitcoin blockchain. They are created by inscribing an ordinal number into a Bitcoin transaction, which is then recorded on the blockchain. Each ordinal is unique and cannot be replicated or duplicated.\n\nThe Best Bitcoin Ordinals Wallets\n\nAre you looking for a reliable and secure wallet to store your Bitcoin Ordinals? Look no further than the Ordinals Wallet, Hiro Wallet, and Xverse Wallet.\n\nThese three wallets have been pioneers in the world of Bitcoin NFTs and offer advanced features to help you manage your digital assets.\n\n1. Atomic Wallet\n\nAtomic Wallet supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, and provides secure storage for users\u2019 Bitcoin holdings. Like Ordinals Wallet, Atomic Wallet prioritizes the security of users\u2019 private keys and transaction data by employing encryption technology.\n\nAdditionally, Atomic Wallet offers additional features such as built-in staking options, allowing users to earn passive income on their cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nBy offering both a versatile multi-currency wallet and dedicated Bitcoin wallet functionality, Atomic Wallet provides users with the flexibility to manage their Bitcoin assets alongside their other digital assets.\n\nThis versatility makes Atomic Wallet an attractive choice for individuals looking for a comprehensive wallet solution that caters to their various cryptocurrency needs.\n\nWhether users prefer the specialized focus of Ordinals Wallet on Bitcoin or the broader range of supported cryptocurrencies offered by Atomic Wallet, both options prioritize security and aim to provide a user-friendly experience for managing Bitcoin assets.\n\n1. Ordinals Wallet\n\nThe Bitcoin Ordinals Wallet is the newest wallet to come out with explicit support for Ordinals Inscriptions.\n\nIt went live on February 16th and has been gaining a lot of traction since then. The wallet allows users to store, send, and receive Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs (non-fungible tokens).\n\nThe Ordinals Wallet is a dedicated wallet designed specifically for storing and managing Bitcoin Ordinals. It offers advanced security features such as multi-signature support, two-factor authentication, and cold storage options.\n\nThe wallet also allows users to view their transaction history and manage their digital assets with ease.\n\n2. Xverse Wallet\n\nXverse is a Bitcoin wallet designed specifically for web3 applications. The wallet allows users to store, send, and receive Bitcoin while interacting with decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nIt also supports features such as token swapping and trading digital assets. The most unique feature of the Xverse wallet is its support for Ordinals Inscriptions, a protocol allowing users to securely transfer tokens without needing a third-party intermediary.\n\nThis makes it easier and faster to trade tokens on the blockchain. It also provides enhanced security, as no private keys are ever exposed when transferring funds.\n\nOne advantage of using Xverse is its availability across platforms \u2013 there\u2019s an app available on iOS, Google Play, and the App Store. The simple user interface makes it easy to navigate around the wallet and find what you need.\n\nXverse has some drawbacks as well. For instance, it can be difficult to use for beginners because of all the advanced features. Additionally, since it\u2019s still relatively new compared to other web wallets, there may be compatibility issues with certain dApps or tokens.\n\nOverall, Xverse is a great choice if you\u2019re looking for a Bitcoin wallet specifically designed for web3 applications that support state-of-the-art features like Ordinals Inscriptions. If you don\u2019t mind dealing with some potential compatibility issues then it could be a great option for you.\n\n3. Hiro Wallet\n\nHiro Wallet just launched its testnet on February 14, before both Xverse and Ordinals Wallet.\n\nHiro Wallet CEO Mark Hendrickson has stated that the company\u2019s intentions to provide comprehensive support for Stacks-based NFTs and Ordinal inscriptions are just getting started.\n\nHiro Wallet works in the same way as Xverse. Gamma is the inscriber, and Ordinals are sent straight to a user\u2019s account under a section called \u201cCollectibles.\u201d Users will have easy access to their Ordinals collection in this way.\n\nHiro Wallet, on the other hand, is distinguished by its support for Stacks-based NFTs, allowing its users to safely trade and store a wide variety of digital assets on the blockchain. Further upgrades designed to improve the user experience will be released shortly.\n\nAs more and more firms offer interesting and novel ways for customers to interact with digital assets, the introduction of Hiro Wallet\u2019s testnet is indicative of the rising interest and innovation in the blockchain and cryptocurrency field.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nIn conclusion, if you\u2019re looking for a reliable and secure way to store your Bitcoin Ordinals, consider using one of these three wallets: the Ordinals Wallet, Hiro Wallet, or Xverse Wallet.\n\nEach offers unique features that cater to different needs but all provide top-notch security measures so you can rest assured that your digital assets are safe and sound."

        "content": "Time has changed, and the world with greater modernity and advanced technologies. There is also a change in the pattern of how women save their money and park them for future wealth creation. In recent times, women are taking on more challenging tasks, they're not shy about taking risks when it comes to investment. One such risk would be investing in cryptocurrencies as the market is volatile and highly sensitive. Despite its unpredictable tendency, female investors have likely held more virtual digital assets than male investors, a study shows.\n\nAs per WazirX Survey for the occasion of Women's Day, trading volume on its platform by female users increased by 3.3% in a year.\n\nThe trading volume in crypto assets by female investors rose from 15.27% in 2021 to 18.57% in 2022 despite the year bringing in a liquidity crunch in the market. The year 2022 has borne witness to collapses of major stablecoins, liquidation, bankruptcies, and illiquidity in cryptocurrencies owing to macroeconomic uncertainties.\n\nNot just that, the WazirX survey reveals that the average value of Crypto held per female user on the platform is \u20b99,650, which is almost 30% more than the average value of Crypto held per male user, which is \u20b96,676.\n\nThat being said, women investors now have combined crypto worth \u20b9354.9 crore in their balance.\n\nFurther, the survey highlighted that the highest number of signups among females came from the age group of 25 - 35 in the last two years. It was 51.02% and 44.28% in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Closely following are the female users between 36 - 50 with 29.98% and 32.54% in 2021 and 2022 respectively.\n\nAccording to WazirX, over a period of time it has been observed that Crypto has been preferred by women over traditional assets ever since its adoption started growing. With low entry barriers, better access, and inclusion for users, women find it easier to invest in virtual digital assets.\n\nBitcoin was the most loved cryptocurrency among female investors with a weightage of 21.6%. But Tether with 21% weightage in total volumes emerged as the second most popular digital asset among females. Others were --- WazirX (16.4%), Ethereum (14.3%), Shibu Inu (13.6%), and Dogecoin (13.1%).\n\nAmong the women who had more than 30% of their assets allocated to cryptocurrencies were majorly in the age group of 30-45, followed by the age group of 18-30. Further, 24% of women with more than 30%of their assets in crypto have been investing for more than 3 years.\n\nAs per the survey, among the major reasons to invest in cryptocurrencies would financial independence. 45% of women in the age group of 45-60, 41% in the age group of 18-30, and 34% of women between the ages 30-45 invested in crypto for financial independence. This has been a trend globally where women have chosen crypto for personal wealth creation and portfolio diversification. While 19% of respondents invested in crypto because of combined factors of high returns and potential utility.\n\nWhile 25% of women feel that with crypto investment, they are socially appreciated for trying new forms of financial assets. Whereas, 15% feel that they are considered financially knowledgeable. And 10% feel that they are perceived as knowledgeable of the latest technological developments.\n\nOut of the respondents who were inspired to buy virtual digital assets by external factors --- 51% were influenced by their partners, whereas 32% were influenced by news articles, social media, market trends, etc.\n\nNotably, respondents in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Karnataka, and West Bengal have the highest number of investors who have invested in crypto on their own decision, as well as done sufficient research on the assets.\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "title": "Bitcoin Core Review 2024 | Features, Pricing, Details - CoinJournal",
        "content": "What is the Bitcoin Core Wallet?\n\nBitcoin Core is the fundamental software used by Bitcoin users to send, receive, and store Bitcoin. There are numerous other wallets that can do these tasks today, but in 2009 when Bitcoin was new, Bitcoin Core was the only shop in town. Satoshi Nakamoto created the wallet to serve as a dashboard for the sending and receiving of Bitcoin. To distinguish it from the Bitcoin Network, Bitcoin Core is sometimes referred to as the \u201cSatoshi Client\u201d.\n\nPeople who run the Bitcoin core wallet are running a \u201cFull Node\u201d in the Bitcoin Network, to which the Bitcoin Core Wallet is connected. This means that the Bitcoin Core wallet helps the Bitcoin network confirm and relay Bitcoin transactions (sending, receiving, purchases). The Bitcoin Core wallet is necessary for the Bitcoin network to function at all.\n\nThis means that Bitcoin Core is more than a wallet, but for everyday users, its wallet functionality is all that\u2019s necessary to understand. We\u2019ll cover the deeper functionality in the rest of this Bitcoin Core review, but new users should not be worried that we\u2019ll get too technically complex.\n\nWho Runs the Bitcoin Core Wallet\n\nUnderstanding the Bitcoin Core Wallet is necessary to comprehend Bitcoin as a whole. Bitcoin is a decentralized network, meaning that there\u2019s no one who is in charge of it in the same way that Jeff Bezos is in charge of Amazon, for example. Instead, the network is operated by people who run the Bitcoin Core Wallet (Full Node runners) and miners (those who use powerful computers to confirm Bitcoin transactions and mine new Bitcoins).\n\nThe Bitcoin Core code is, however, maintained by volunteers. People all over the world can make suggestions about how Bitcoin Core may be improved. These are called Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, or BIPs. BIPs are voted upon (and often simply argued about) by developers and the community. Eventually one or more BIPs is incorporated into the Bitcoin Core Code, and a new version of the Bitcoin Core Wallet is released.\n\nA number of developers have become closely associated with the Bitcoin Core development, including Luke Dash, Jr., Gavin Andresen, and others. Because changes to Bitcoin Core are heavily debated in the Bitcoin community, developers like these are sometimes (read: always) controversial.\n\nWhy Does the Bitcoin Core Wallet Matter So Much to Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin (the network, the cryptocurrency) won\u2019t work without the Bitcoin Core wallet. This is because the Bitcoin Core wallet on your device is more than a wallet, it\u2019s a small but necessary part of the entire Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin network is made of Nodes, and each Bitcoin Core wallet is a full node. Together, all of the nodes in the world are a gigantic distributed technology that uses the internet to send Bitcoins all around in a secure and trackable manner.\n\nSo Bitcoin wouldn\u2019t work without Bitcoin Core. That\u2019s why changes to the Bitcoin Core software are so contentious in the cryptocurrency industry. Software updates are made periodically, but large portions of the community don\u2019t agree about what those changes should be. When a consensus (or something close to a consensus is released), a new version of the Bitcoin Core software is released, and miners and node runners around the world download it and use it.\n\nBitcoin Core Wallet Controversies\n\nAnyone can write updates to Bitcoin Core, but unless miners and node holders run the software, it doesn\u2019t matter. Occasionally, however, significant interests arise in Bitcoin and a large group of miners will start to use an alternative version of Bitcoin Core. This is what gave rise to alternative forms of Bitcoin, including the still popular Bitcoin Cash. These alternative visions of what Bitcoin should be cause turmoil in the Bitcoin community, and the occasional schism, but nonetheless Bitcoin remains going strong to this day.\n\nHow to Use the Bitcoin Core Wallet\n\nThe Bitcoin Core wallet is pretty easy to use, but you\u2019ve got to understand some basic functionality about Bitcoin to make it work. The good thing is, this will help you become adept at using all cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin, so it\u2019s definitely worth your time to learn this stuff. Let\u2019s start by downloading the Bitcoin Core Wallet so that you can poke around on your own. Do this by going to Bitcoin.org and downloading the software for your operating system (Bitcoin Core Windows, Bitcoin Core Linus, Bitcoin Core Mac, and Bitcoin Core Ubuntu are all options).\n\nDownloading and Installing Bitcoin Core Wallet\n\nBitcoin Core is currently in version 0.16.0. To run a full node as well as using the wallet, you\u2019ll have to download the 155 GB Bitcoin blockchain. We won\u2019t go over that here, but there are endless resources about how to do just that if you are interested.\n\nFor Mac users (and those with certain settings on other operating systems), you\u2019ll have to confirm that you do wish to open the software using the option in System Preferences > Security. This means that even though the Bitcoin Core wallet wasn\u2019t created by a big developer like Apple, it\u2019s still OK to run on your computer.\n\nAs you open the wallet, it will undergo a fairly long process (several minutes) during which time your copy of Bitcoin Core\u2019s \u201cLedger\u201d (a complete record of every transaction that has ever occurred on the Bitcoin network) will be checked against every other node and miner in the network. Be patient. Eventually your wallet will open up and you\u2019ll be able to use it.\n\nUsing Your Bitcoin Core Wallet to Send, Receive, and Store\n\nThere are a number of things to note in this simple interface. We\u2019ll go through all of them so you have no confusion.\n\nOverview : this shows you most of the most relevant information related to your Bitcoin core wallet.On the left you can see how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet, any Bitcoin that is currently being transferred into your wallet, and how many transactions you have performed with this wallet. On the right you can see your most recent transactions, including the address of the sender or recipient related to each transaction.\n\n: this shows you most of the most relevant information related to your Bitcoin core wallet.On the left you can see how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet, any Bitcoin that is currently being transferred into your wallet, and how many transactions you have performed with this wallet. On the right you can see your most recent transactions, including the address of the sender or recipient related to each transaction. Send Coins : This button takes you to a screen with an address line. Every Bitcoin transaction (and every cryptocurrency transaction, for that matter) requires the sender to know the address of the receiver. Your Bitcoin Core wallet address can be seen in the next button. It\u2019s a long alpha-numeric code. Anyone who wants to send Bitcoin to you needs to have this code. More on that in a second. When sending coins using the \u201cSend Coins\u201d window, always be careful to double check the address to which you are sending the transaction. Transactions sent to incorrect addresses usually cannot be recovered. Also be careful to send the amount of BTC you intend.\n\n: This button takes you to a screen with an address line.

It\u2019s like your street address at which you receive snail mail. This address isn\u2019t sensitive, and you shouldn\u2019t worry about keeping it safe. Anyone can have it, and they would not be able to derive your Private Key (more on this soon).\n\n: This is where you\u2019ll find your Bitcoin Core wallet address.

These can include friends\u2019 addresses, Bitcoin addresses used by retailers, addresses associated with charities or political campaigns, etc. Export: This last button allows the Bitcoin Core Export Private Key function. Private Keys are an important idea to understand. Just like your wallet address, your private key is a long alpha-numeric code associated with your account. If you were to take your computer that holds the Bitcoin Core software and throw it into the Sun, you could simply get another computer and recreate your wallet using your Private Key. Think of it as the secret code that can clone your Bitcoin core wallet (and the Bitcoins it contains) anywhere in the world.\n\nThe thing is, anyone else who has the private key could do the same thing. You should keep your Private Key as safe as possible. This writer writes private keys down in two different locations, where a flood or fire could destroy one but not the other. This writer also never stores private keys online, as they could be hacked. Keep your private key safe, and your Bitcoins should be safe forever.\n\nOther Important Ideas About the Bitcoin Core Wallet\n\nHere are some important ideas which will help you understand Bitcoin and keep your Bitcoins safe.\n\nYour wallet doesn\u2019t \u201cstore\u201d your Bitcoin. Instead, it\u2019s just an interface through which you can interact with your Bitcoins. Your Bitcoins \u201clive\u201d on the blockchain, and are linked to your Private Key. Only those with the private key can use the Bitcoin Core wallet interface to view, send, and receive Bitcoins linked to your Bitcoin core wallet address. All of this means that even if your Bitcoin core wallet device is lost, stolen, or destroyed, your Bitcoins still exist safely on the blockchain. As long as you have your Private Key, you can recover them.\n\nBitcoin is not truly anonymous as is sometimes supposed. A complete record of every Bitcoin transaction is captured in the public ledger system shared by Bitcoin nodes and miners. Though it would be time- and resource-consuming to retroactively assemble a user\u2019s transaction record, it would be possible. Some users use \u201ctumblers\u201d and other methods to achieve something resembling Bitcoin anonymity.\n\nFinal Thoughts About Bitcoin Core Wallet\n\nBitcoin and the Bitcoin Core Wallet are innovations in global economics and computer science. To learn them is to learn the heart of cryptocurrency as a whole, and the ripples of this innovation will continue to be felt for years, if not decades, to come. The basic functionality of the Bitcoin Core wallet front-end is easy for the beginner to appreciate, but the backend takes months of research and experience to fully appreciate.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown how long Bitcoin will remain dominant over the blockchain industry, or whether it will achieve the million dollar mark various analysts have prophesied. It\u2019s true that Bitcoin\u2019s value results from an elegant application of supply relative to global demand, and a simple software solution to keeping track of all of the bookkeeping.\n\nWhatever becomes of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Core wallet will remain useful for many years to come, and will be a testament to a significant innovation in history. Whether or not the history of global finance will hinge on Bitcoin will be decided by future generations. But as members of the present, an acquaintance with the Bitcoin wallet is essential both to using Bitcoin and to using its elegant design."

        "title": "Controversy Behind new Ordinal Bitcoin NFTs - Tekedia",
        "content": "Ordinal Bitcoin NFTs have two key features that distinguish them from others. Firstly, they are made up of on-chain data, meaning the actual image for the NFT is stored directly on the blockchain, rather than being linked to an external website like most NFTs on Ethereum.\n\nThis makes them unique and more secure, as the data cannot be lost or altered without affecting the blockchain itself. Eric Wall, a Swedish researcher and former Arcane Assets CIO, believes that storing fully on-chain NFTs is now seven times cheaper on Bitcoin compared to Ethereum.\n\nSecondly, NFTs are linked to individual satoshis, unlike Ethereum NFTs, which have their own token. This creates a connection between the NFT and the underlying asset, Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, it can be challenging to maintain this connection because Bitcoins are fungible, meaning each one is interchangeable and can only be differentiated through a complex transaction input-output system.\n\nTo solve this issue, Ordinals uses a shared numbering system that assigns every satoshi an ordinal number based on the order in which it was mined. This numbering system, along with other details, is used to maintain continuity for NFTs.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Bitcoin does not natively support these features, and NFT holders may accidentally spend their NFTs on transaction fees if they are not careful.\n\nThe world of crypto, DeFi, blockchain, NFTs etc is a very community-focused space. And with every new development, the community ferociously discusses their opinions of it.\n\nThe supporters of the project suggest that it will have an overall favourable impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem. They believe that the integration of NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain is a positive development that will bring more fees and use cases to the chain. This view is held by prominent Bitcoin influencer Dan Held, who argues that every transaction paying its fee is not spam and that the Bitcoin blockchain is open and accessible for anyone to build upon.\n\nSome individuals believe that incorporating NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain will negatively impact its financial and transactional use case. The CEO of Blockstream Adam Back, who is rumoured to be Satoshi Nakamoto, is a part of this group. He supports this argument and has suggested that Bitcoin users must \u201ceducate and encourage developers who care about bitcoin\u2019s use-case to either not do that, or do it in a prunable space-efficient e.g. time-stamp way.\u201d\n\nHe also took to Twitter to express his views on the project. He said that \u201c\u201dyou can\u2019t stop them\u201d well of course Bitcoin is designed to be censor resistant. doesn\u2019t stop us mildly commenting on the sheer waste and stupidity of an encoding, at least do something efficient. Otherwise it\u2019s another proof of the consumption of block-space thingy.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Casey Rodarmor responded to the criticism with the following arguments,\n\nI actually love the haters,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, they do more to drive people to find out about the project than anybody else. I don\u2019t know what they think when they have these massive audiences, and they go, \u2018This is an attack on Bitcoin\u2019\u2014it seems like you don\u2019t want to do that if you don\u2019t want people to use the thing.\n\nHe also added counterpoints that stated\n\n\u201cMy design goal, from the beginning, was to create something that would strike people as being Bitcoin native. That means it can\u2019t have a token, and it can\u2019t be a sidechain. One thing that people don\u2019t understand is that in order for Bitcoin to be secure, blocks must be full\u2014that is part of the Bitcoin security model,\u201d he said. \u201cIf blocks are not full, nobody has any reason to pay more than the minimum fee rate to have their transactions included. So, as a result, blocks must be full.\u201d\n\nThe hype surrounding the Ordinals NFT has driven the price of the Stacks cryptocurrency (STX) up nearly 200% as of February. Ordinal NFTs, which are similar to Ethereum and other smart contract-based NFTs, use the smallest unit of bitcoin, the satoshi, to encode digital art, profile pictures, videos, audios and images directly on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\u201cThe full potential of the Stacks network is beginning to be recognized which could drive the STX token rally even further,\u201d Thielen said.\n\nThe NFT craze has faded in recent months amid the bitcoin, ethereum, and crypto price crash that wiped off nearly $2 trillion from the combined crypto market. The merger of NFTs and the bitcoin network provides greater security, transparency, and traceability, opening up more use cases and rekindling interest around NFTs.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n"

This situation has resulted in a keen interest in how Bitcoin price movement will react in the coming days.\n\nA crypto analyst by Twitter pseudonym StockmoneyL in a tweet on March 3, stated that the Silvergate liquidity concerns is a Bitcoin \u2018short-term sentiment killer.\u2019\n\nWith the situation putting pressure on Bitcoin\u2019s price, the analyst identified the $21,400 level as the next support position if the maiden cryptocurrency fails to overcome the $22,800 resistance.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nSilvergate bank fallout\n\nThe projection comes after Bitcoin suffered a sharp fall in the wake of Silvergate, stating that it was evaluating its ability to continue with operations and that it was in the process of re-evaluating its businesses and strategies.\n\nSilvergate also noted that it faced a bank run late last year, leading to the sale of its assets at a loss, affecting its overall capitalization. The uncertainty has resulted in the possibility of an increased regulatory crackdown, considering that the lender is a member of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nInterestingly, crypto trading expert and analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe warned that the Silvergate situation mirrors the Mt.Gox hacking incident, and investors should expect further fallout from the situation.\n\n\u201cSilvergate crashes yesterday, and markets are down. Within a timespan of 12 hours, we\u2019re talking about Mt. Gox, the worse to happen with Ethereum (ETH) unlocks, Tether to collapse, Big Crisis to happen, and more. Typical crypto,\u201d he said in a tweet on March 3.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was trading at $22,339, representing daily losses of about 4%. On the weekly chart, BTC is down almost 7%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart.

        "title": "Bitcoin's inflation rate is now three times lower than U.S. dollar's - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "With over 90% of Bitcoin (BTC) in circulating supply, the asset\u2019s inflation rate has fallen significantly over the years to beat that of the United States dollar (USD) by at least three times. This is placing Bitcoin to act as a possible hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dropping inflation rate stems from the cryptocurrency\u2019s fixed supply of 21 million BTCs. The rate drops after every four years during the halving event. As a result, the maiden cryptocurrency\u2019s inflation rate has been on a steady decline since its inception in 2009 to stand at 1.79% as of March 4, data by crypto analysis platform WooBull indicates.\n\nBitcoin inflation rate chart. Source: Woobull\n\nAt the same time, the annual inflation rate of the U.S. dollar in 2023 stands at 6.4%. The value peaked at 7% in 2021, data by USInflationCalculator indicates. This implies that the U.S. dollar inflation rate is 3.57 times higher than Bitcoin.\n\nU.S. dollar annual inflation rate. Source: USInflationCalculator\n\nIntrigues of Bitcoin\u2019s dropping inflation rate\n\nBitcoin\u2019s ability to record a low inflationary rate is because of the asset\u2019s deflationary model. The design means that the inflation rate decreases post-halving events. The rate is determined by the reward system for miners, which is split in half with each halving event. During the halving event, Bitcoin rewards for miners are reduced by half. This means that the number of Bitcoins produced through mining is halved, with the next event estimated to take place in May 2024.\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. dollar inflation rate will likely rise as the currency\u2019s value decreases over time. The plunge in value is primarily due to excessive printing and the diminishing purchasing power of each dollar. Notably, inflation can be caused by several factors, including an increase in the money supply, a decrease in demand, or a decrease in production.\n\nExperts have also opined that Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate remains lower due to its decentralization nature, meaning the maiden crypto can circumvent most political and economic risks linked with the U.S. dollar.\n\nBest inflation hedge?\n\nThe contrasting inflation rate between the assets has translated to a debate over the best investment option and the perfect hedge. Bitcoin proponents argue that BTC is the ideal asset to protect against inflation.\n\nHowever, the same has yet to translate to the asset\u2019s price amid rising inflation and interest rate hikes. Amid the broader economic downturn, Bitcoin and the general cryptocurrency market have suffered significant losses.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s 2023 rally has been cut short, with the crypto facing threats of retesting lows below $20,000. By press time, BTC was trading at $22,382."
