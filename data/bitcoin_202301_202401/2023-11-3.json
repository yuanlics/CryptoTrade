        "title": "Why Governments Are Wary of Bitcoin - Investopedia",
        "content": "Since its introduction in a 2008 whitepaper, Bitcoin (BTCUSD) has generated controversy and news. Its enthusiasts herald the cryptocurrency\u2019s launch as the advent of a new and equitable monetary system. Critics point to the cryptocurrency\u2019s role in criminal activities and the absence of legal recognition as proof that it is \u201crat poison squared.\u201d The reality probably lies somewhere in between.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, governments around the world are eyeing Bitcoin\u2019s advance and taking action when they can. Some, like El Salvador, have adopted it as currency. Others refuse to recognize it as legal tender, treat it as a commodity or property, or even ban it completely. In 2023, the European Union adopted a framework for regulating cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nAmong other things, Bitcoin enables the citizens of a country to undermine government authority by circumventing capital controls imposed by it. It also facilitates nefarious activities by helping criminals evade detection. Finally, by removing intermediaries, Bitcoin can potentially throw a wrench in the existing financial infrastructure system and destabilize it.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Governments around the world are eyeing Bitcoin's advance warily because it has the potential to upend the existing financial system and undermine their role in it.\n\nIn its current form, Bitcoin presents three challenges to government authority: it cannot be regulated, criminals use it, and it can help citizens circumvent capital controls.\n\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies will continue to be viewed with distrust by established authorities until they can more effectively monitor and control them.\n\nEffective Governments Require Trust\n\nTo understand why governments are cautious about Bitcoin, it is important to understand the role that fiat currencies play in a country\u2019s economy. Fiat refers to conventional currencies issued by governments. Fiat money is backed by the full faith and credit of a government. This means that governments promise to make a currency borrower whole in case of a default.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. government relies on the Federal Reserve, a central bank on which Congress only has partial authority, to manage the supply of circulating money. The cycle of transactions in the U.S. economy\u2014one that involves borrowers, lenders, and consumers\u2014relies on a chain of trust between transacting parties. The Federal Reserve, the lender of the last resort, is the final leg of that chain, lending only to depository institutions.\n\n\n\nBitcoin advocates charge that the Fed creates money out of thin air (i.e., the currency is not backed by tangible assets). By manipulating the supply of money in the U.S. economy, they say, the central bank also manufactures asset bubbles and crises.\n\n\n\nGovernments facilitate the role of central banks in an economy. While central banks are involved in making policies related to money, they do not have the authority to regulate its use. That responsibility lies with the government. Through a series of intermediaries, such as banks and financial institutions, governments distribute and regulate the flow and use of money in an economy. Thus, they can dictate how it is transferred, sectors where it is distributed, and trace its utility. They also earn revenue from it by taxing the earnings of individuals and businesses.\n\n\n\nBitcoin Undermines the Cycle of Trust\n\nBitcoin\u2019s decentralized system has the potential to dismantle the system described above. Its network does away with intermediaries and, by extension, the elements of a government\u2019s system.\n\n\n\nWhen cryptocurrency is used, a central bank is no longer required. That is because it can be produced by anyone running a full node. Peer-to-peer automated transfers between two parties on Bitcoin\u2019s network mean intermediaries are no longer required to manage and distribute currency.\n\n\n\nThe chain of trust underpinning the current financial infrastructure becomes an algorithmic construct in Bitcoin\u2019s network. A transaction is generally not included in the central ledger unless a specified majority of nodes approve it.\n\n\n\nTheoretically, at least, the streamlining of operations between individuals and various actors on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain can rearrange the current system. The financial infrastructure is decentralized, and the power to increase or decrease currency supply is not appointed to a single or group of authorities. Thus, in the new setup, the role of governments in managing and regulating economic policy through intermediaries may become superfluous.\n\n\n\nReasons Governments Are Wary\n\nWhether the state- and regulation-less future envisaged by Bitcoin evangelists comes to pass is still an open question. Meanwhile, governments around the world are trying to understand the effect that cryptocurrency might have on their economies in the near term. Specifically, they are grappling with the following three problems Bitcoin and cryptocurrency present in their current forms.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. government seized nearly $8 billion in cryptocurrency in three operations between 2022 and 2023, but there have been many more operations, resulting in vast amounts of cryptocurrency seized.\n\nBitcoin Can Circumvent Government-Imposed Capital Controls\n\nGovernments often institute capital controls to prevent currency outflows because exports could debase their currency's value. For some, this is another form of control exerted by governments on economic and fiscal policy. In such instances, the state-less nature of Bitcoin comes in handy for circumventing capital controls and exporting wealth.\n\n\n\nOne of the more well-known instances of capital flight using Bitcoin has occurred in China. The country's citizens have an annual limit of $50,000 to purchase foreign currency. A report by Chainalysis, a crypto forensics firm, found that more than $50 billion moved from East-Asia-based Bitcoin wallets to wallets in other countries in 2020, meaning Chinese citizens may have converted local currency to Bitcoin and transferred it across borders to sidestep government regulation. Not all $50 billion is thought to be from China or capital flight, but it shows an increase in capital movement in the form of cryptocurrency from previous years.\n\n\n\nBitcoin Ties to Illegal Activity\n\nThe ability to bypass existing financial infrastructure for a country is a blessing in disguise for criminals because it enables them to camouflage their involvement in such activities. Bitcoin\u2019s network is pseudonymous, meaning users are identified only by their addresses on the network. It isn't easy to trace the provenance of a transaction or the identity of an individual or organization behind the address. Besides this, the algorithmic trust engendered by Bitcoin\u2019s network obviates the need for trusted contacts at either end of an illegal transaction.\n\n\n\nNot surprisingly, Bitcoin is a favored conduit by criminals for financial transactions. The most famous example of a crime involving bitcoin was the Silk Road case. Briefly, Silk Road was a marketplace for guns and illegal drugs, among other things, on the Dark Web. It allowed users to pay in bitcoins. The cryptocurrency was held in escrow until the buyer confirmed the receipt of the goods. It was difficult for law enforcement to trace parties involved in the transaction because they only had blockchain addresses as identification. Eventually, however, the FBI was able to take down the marketplace and seize 174,000 BTC.\n\n\n\nRecently, infecting popular applications with ransomware and demanding payment in bitcoin has also become popular with hackers. The 2021 Colonial Pipeline hack, which resulted in energy supply disruptions in various states, demonstrated the degree to which such attacks can become national security issues.\n\n\n\nBitcoin Is Not Regulated\n\nMore than a decade after Bitcoin was introduced, governments around the world are still trying to figure out ways to regulate the cryptocurrency. There are multiple strands to Bitcoin's regulation problem.\n\n\n\nIs Bitcoin a currency to be used in daily transactions or a store of value primarily used for investment purposes? Is Bitcoin a safe haven asset during times of global economic turmoil? Neither the so-called Bitcoin experts nor the average bitcoin investor agree\u2014it's possible that all are true.\n\n\n\nIt could be argued that the use of bitcoin in investing products like futures is proof of its attractiveness to traders. Government-approved marketplaces like the CME Group and the Cboe offer regulated cryptocurrency futures, and exchanges in more developed countries must register with the appropriate authority, like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). But in other countries, it isn't regulated as strictly, so concerns about investor and user safety arise because cryptocurrency has a global reach and possibly influence.\n\n\n\nCryptocurrencies Are Opaque Ecosystems\n\nWhile Bitcoin has the potential to upend established dynamics of the existing financial ecosystem, it is still plagued by several problems. Government wariness about the cryptocurrency can be partly attributed to fear and partly to the lack of transparency about its ecosystem. The latter concern is not misplaced.\n\n\n\nLittle is known about the cause-and-effect relationship between Bitcoin's influence and global developments\u2014it hasn't yet reached a scale equal to that of the dollar. That is a crucial sticking point in light of the cryptocurrency's volatile price swings; if it were to gain the influence of the dollar, it could have serious repercussions globally.\n\n\n\nWhy Does the Government Want to Ban Bitcoin? As of Nov. 3, 2023, there have been no indications that the U.S. government wants to ban Bitcoin. However, other countries have executed bans due to regulatory and monetary policy concerns or because their governments fear a loss of control.\n\nIs the Government Trying to Regulate Bitcoin? The governments of the U.S. and other developed nations want to regulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Most do so using the claim of responsibility for ensuring they are safe for consumers, businesses, or investors to use. These concerns are valid, but opponents of regulation say there are other motives behind the regulatory attempts.\n\nCan the Government Seize Your Bitcoin? As demonstrated by the arrest of Ho Wan Kwok and the seizure of more than $630 million in cryptocurrency, the government can seize your bitcoin if you're using it to engage in illegal activities.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin has become a touchstone for controversy since it was introduced to the world in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Governments have become wary of Bitcoin and have alternated between criticizing cryptocurrency and investigating its use for their ends.\n\n\n\nWhile it has the potential to decentralize and change the workings of the existing financial infrastructure, the cryptocurrency\u2019s ecosystem is still rife with misuse, scandals, and criminals. Bitcoin will likely continue to provoke distrust and criticism from established authorities. With that in mind, government-backed cryptocurrencies called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) based on blockchain technology are more likely to be accepted by governments than decentralized ones.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "title": "ARK\u2019s Cathie Wood is betting on Bitcoin, saying the \u2018digital gold\u2019 is more inflation and deflation-proof than traditional assets - Fortune",
        "content": "Critics of Bitcoin have only gained further ammunition with the conclusion of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s fraud case\u2014but Cathie Wood is standing by the asset.\n\nFor the past couple of years the CEO of Ark Invest has maintained that prices will begin to fall\u2014or deflate\u2014thanks to emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain.\n\nDespite some current evidence to the contrary\u2014the Fed has been waging a war to bring inflation down since March 2022\u2014Wood said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to see deflation before all of this is over, and we\u2019re beginning to see it already.\n\n\u201cWe think this period of time is much more like the 19-teens than the 1970s.\u201d\n\nThe decade of high inflation in the latter part of the 20th century has drawn comparisons to the current climate, with Deutsche Bank saying it is seeing a \u201cstriking number of parallels\u201d between the two.\n\nYet irrespective of inflation or deflation, Wood\u2019s long term priorities remained focussed on Bitcoin\u2014which she believes will weather either storm.\n\nWhen asked whether she\u2019d choose to hold gold, cash or Bitcoin over the next 10 years on Bloomberg\u2019s Merryn Talks Moneypodcast, Wood responded: \u201cBitcoin, hands down. Bitcoin is a hedge against both inflation and deflation\u2014so is gold\u2014but Bitcoin is digital \u2026 gold already has its demand, it\u2019s happened, Bitcoin is new.\n\n\u201cInstitutions are barely involved and young people would much prefer to hold Bitcoin than to hold gold.\u201d\n\nShe acknowledged that both gold and Bitcoin are hedges against deflation but said the cryptocurrency has been performing better recently.\n\nThe asset, which Wood describes as \u201cdigital gold\u201d is sitting at more than $34,000 at the time of writing. That\u2019s down from in excess of $64,000 in late 2021.\n\nARK said the asset will be worth $1.48 million by 2030 in a report published earlier this year, representing a more than 4,252% increase from its current price.\n\nWood pushed back on the assumption that the current rise in the price of Bitcoin is because buyers are trying to hedge against inflation, saying the asset protects just as well against deflation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that inflation is why it\u2019s going up,\u201d Wood said. \u201cThere\u2019s no counterparty risk in Bitcoin, it\u2019s a completely transparent, decentralized network you can see everything that\u2019s going on on the network.\n\n\u201cYou cannot see what\u2019s going on inside regional banks, you can only surmise because they\u2019re losing deposits and they have to fund those by selling securities.\u201d\n\nThe emptying Bitcoin train\n\nThose flying the flag for coins may be somewhat subdued after the so-called \u2018crypto king,\u2019 Sam Bankman Fried, was found guilty of seven counts on Thursday, the culmination of a year-long criminal proceeding following the November 2022 collapse of the crypto exchange FTX.\n\n\u201cSam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history\u2014a multibillion-dollar scheme designed to make him the king of crypto,\u201d U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said at a Thursday night press conference. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing: The cryptocurrency industry might be new, the players like Sam Bankman-Fried might be new, but this kind of fraud, this kind of corruption, is as old as time. And we have no patience for it.\u201d\n\nThe culmination of the month-long trial may be the latest news in the crypto world, but fears over the market\u2019s legitimacy have been long-held by legendary investors.\n\nWarren Buffett famously said he wouldn\u2019t take \u201call the Bitcoin in the world\u201d\u2014currently worth around $670 billion\u2014for $25.\n\n\u201cWhat would I do with it?\u201d Buffett asked. \u201cI have to sell it back to you, one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon agrees with Wood that blockchain is a \u201cdeployable\u201d technology, but says Bitcoin is a \u201chyped-up fraud.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think all that\u2019s been a waste of time and why you guys waste any breath on it is totally beyond me,\u201d he told CNBC last year. \u201cBitcoin itself is a hyped up fraud. It\u2019s a pet rock.\u201d\n\nThis type of resounding criticism has also been issued by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. While his adversary\u2014and the richest man on earth\u2014Elon Musk is a fan of cryptocurrencies, Gates is underwhelmed.\n\nCryptocurrencies are \u201c100% based on greater fool theory\u201d Gates said last year, adding: \u201cI\u2019m used to asset classes \u2026 like a farm where they have output, or like a company where they make products.\u201d"

        "content": "PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The conviction of former cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried for stealing at least $10 billion from customers and investors is the latest black mark for the cryptocurrency industry, but in Washington, there seems to be little to no interest in pushing through regulation.\n\nWhen cryptocurrencies collapsed and a number of companies failed last year, Congress considered multiple approaches for how to regulate the industry in the future. However, most of those efforts have gone nowhere, especially in this chaotic year that has been dominated by geopolitical tensions, inflation and the upcoming 2024 election.\n\nIronically, the failure of Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX and his subsequent arrest late last year may have contributed to the momentum for regulation stalling out. Before FTX imploded, Bankman-Fried spent millions of dollars \u2014 illegally taken from his customers it turns out \u2014 to influence the discussion around cryptocurrency regulation in Washington and push for action.\n\nWithout Congress, federal regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission have stepped in to take their own enforcement actions against the industry, including the filing of lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, two of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nAnd most recently PayPal received a subpoena from the SEC related to its PayPal USD stablecoin, the company said in a filing with securities regulators Wednesday. \u201cThe subpoena requests the production of documents,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are cooperating with the SEC in connection with this request.\u201d\n\nStill, Congress still has yet to act.\n\nSens. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and John Boozman, R-Ark., proposed last year to hand over the regulatory authority over cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Stabenow and Boozman lead the Senate Agriculture Committee, which has authority over the CTFC.\n\nOne big stumbling block in the Senate has been Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, chair of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nBrown has been highly skeptical of cryptocurrencies as a concept and he\u2019s been generally reluctant to put Congress\u2019 blessing on them through regulation. He\u2019s held several committee hearings over cryptocurrency issues, ranging from the negative impact on consumers to use of the currencies in funding illicit activities, but has not advanced any legislation out of his committee.\n\n\u201cAmericans continue to lose money every day in crypto scams and frauds,\u201d Brown said in a statement after Bankman-Fried was convicted. \u201cWe need to crack down on abuses and can\u2019t let the crypto industry write its own rulebook.\u201d\n\nIn the House, a bill that would put regulatory guardrails around stablecoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies that are supposed to be backed by hard assets like the U.S. dollar \u2014 passed out of the House Financial Services Committee this summer. But that bill has gotten zero interest from the White House and the Senate.\n\nPresident Joe Biden last year signed an executive order on government oversight of cryptocurrency that urges the Federal Reserve to explore whether the central bank should jump in and create its own digital currency. So far, however, there has been no movement on that front.\n\nConsumer advocates are skeptical about the need for new rules.\n\n\u201cThere is no need for any special interest crypto legislation which would only legitimize an industry that is used by speculators, financial predators, and criminals,\u201d said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a nonprofit that works to \u201cbuild a more secure financial system for all Americans,\u201d according to its website.\n\n\u201cMoreover, almost everything the crypto industry does is clearly covered by existing securities and commodities laws that every other law-abiding financial firm in the country follow,\u201d he said.\n\nBartlett Collins Naylor, a financial policy advocate for Public Citizen\u2019s Congress Watch said \u201claws on fraud and securities are currently sound.\u201d\n\nCryptocurrency advocates, meanwhile, are quick to note that it was Bankman-Fried on trial, not the entire industry.\n\n\u201cAs the jury found, this was a clear case of fraud committed by a small group of individuals,\u201d said Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation. \u201cIt\u2019s an unrelated fact that the U.S. needs regulatory clarity in the digital asset space. Policymakers were focused on this reality before this trial, and will continue to focus on it going forward.\u201d\n\n__\n\nHussein reported from Lewiston, Maine"

        "content": "Block, maker of the Cash App, recorded an increase in revenue from sales of bitcoin of $660.8 million in the third quarter, according to a regulatory filing Thursday.\n\nThe 37% increase over the company\u2019s second quarter results reflects its customer\u2019s appetite for buying bitcoin, even though the asset\u2019s price fell by 11% during that period. These results have not yet accounted for the price surge experienced in October.\n\nTotal bitcoin revenue was reported to be $2.42 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.76 billion in the same period last year. After deducting costs of acquiring that bitcoin on behalf of customers, profit from sales came in around $45 million, similar to Block\u2019s reported second quarter results.\n\n\u201cThe increase in the three months ended Sept. 30, 2023 was driven by an increase in both the average market price of bitcoin and the quantity of bitcoin sold to customers compared to the three months ended Sept. 30, 2022,\u201d Block stated.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin sold to Cash App users rises to nearly $2.4B in Q2\n\nBitcoin (BTC) finished September about 30% higher than its price to close out September 2022.\n\nBlock, formerly known as Square, launched bitcoin trading on Cash App in 2018. Block currently provides custody services for all 25,083 bitcoins, valued at around $858 million at time of publication, held on behalf of its customers.\n\nIn 2023, it ceased lending any bitcoin and is not making use of any third-party custodians, the filing said.\n\n\u201cThe Company does not use any of the bitcoin custodied for customers or trading partners as collateral for any of the Company\u2019s loans or other financing arrangements; nor does it lend or pledge bitcoin held for others to any third parties,\u201d it said.\n\nThe company\u2019s gross profit from its bitcoin trading services represent just 5% of Cash App gross profit, and 3% of the company\u2019s total gross profit in 2023. This is equal to its gross profit figures for the first three quarters of 2022.\n\nBitcoin on Block\u2019s balance sheet\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price rise naturally means that for the third consecutive quarter, Block recorded no impairment losses on its bitcoin held for investment.\n\nThe company\u2019s bitcoin investment is susceptible to impairment losses whenever the fair value of bitcoin falls below its carrying value within a quarter. These losses persist until the bitcoin is sold. Previously, the company recorded impairment charges amounting to $117.7 million.\n\nBlock\u2019s investment holdings of BTC remain roughly unchanged, and the company reports a cumulative total of $220 million in bitcoin as of the close of the third quarter. That aligns with its reported fair value of $216.5 million.\n\nHowever, the price of bitcoin has rallied about 27% since then, which puts Block well in the green on a fair value basis.\n\n\u201cWe believe cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment that aligns with our corporate purpose,\u201d the company said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

However, everyone is wondering whether BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF is simply the start of a larger movement that might change the investment landscape.\n\nIs the BlackRock proposal game-changing?\n\nThe idea by BlackRock to develop a Bitcoin ETF is undeniably significant in the world of cryptocurrencies. With more than $9 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock's move into the cryptocurrency field reflects growing institutional interest in digital assets. The new ETF, dubbed the \"BlackRock Bitcoin Trust,\" intends to provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin by directly holding the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe significance of this suggestion stems from the possibility of widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies by traditional investors. If approved, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF would join a growing list of Bitcoin ETFs in North America, including VanEck and Grayscale. Such approval would indicate that Bitcoin is becoming more widely accepted as a viable asset class in the investment world.\n\nThe Evolution of Cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Funds\n\nCryptocurrency ETFs have been a hot topic for several years. An ETF's attraction stems from its ability to provide investors with exposure to cryptocurrencies without the hassles of owning and holding digital assets. While the principle is simple, regulatory obstacles and worries about market manipulation have slowed the acceptance of these investment vehicles.\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nPurpose Investments in Canada created the first Bitcoin ETF in North America in February 2021. This event was a watershed moment for bitcoin adoption in traditional finance. Following that, additional Canadian ETF providers, such as Evolve Funds Group and CI Global Asset Management, launched Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nBecause of worries about market manipulation and investor protection, the SEC has been hesitant to approve Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. The SEC, on the other hand, has just begun considering numerous Bitcoin ETF proposals, including BlackRock's. The outcome of these proposals could set a precedent for the larger bitcoin ETF market in the United States.\n\nBitcoin Institutional Validation\n\nThe interest of institutional behemoths such as BlackRock in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ETFs is a huge endorsement of the digital asset class. Traditional financial institutions are beginning to see the potential of cryptocurrencies to diversify and increase returns in investment portfolios. This validation can instill confidence in both retail and institutional investors.\n\nInstitutional adoption has already begun, with large corporations such as Tesla, Square, and MicroStrategy including Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Furthermore, financial organizations such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have taken attempts to provide their clients with bitcoin investment products.\n\nBlackRock's entry into the Bitcoin ETF industry not only validates cryptocurrencies, but also illustrates the global financial ecosystem's broader trend toward digital assets. It has the potential to open the door for more financial institutions to investigate digital currencies as a genuine asset class.\n\nThe Benefits and Difficulties of Cryptocurrency ETFs\n\nCryptocurrency ETFs provide various benefits to investors. They offer a regulated and secure means to obtain exposure to cryptocurrencies without requiring wallets or direct ownership. Furthermore, because ETFs are easily traded on standard stock markets, they are accessible to a wide spectrum of investors.\n\nHowever, difficulties persist. Given the young and uncontrolled nature of cryptocurrency markets, one of the key concerns is market manipulation. The SEC and other regulators are concerned to ensure that proper safeguards are in place to protect investors from fraudulent activity and price manipulation.\n\nFurthermore, cryptocurrency custody presents a particular problem for ETF providers. It is critical to safeguard digital assets since the loss or theft of cryptocurrencies can have serious financial ramifications. To protect the security of investors' holdings, ETF issuers must collaborate with trustworthy custodians.\n\nNavigating Crypto's Future Amid Regulatory Shifts\n\nMiners, who have contributed to Bitcoin's network stability, may see potential profitability gains with the heightened demand expected from the ETF. However, the adoption of such financial instruments suggests an industry trend toward increased regulation, leading to new considerations and adaptations for miners.\n\nConcerns include the possibility of capital flowing from mining investments to more traditional Wall Street options. Miners must evolve their strategies to remain competitive in this evolving landscape.\n\nBlackRock's ETF also draws considerable attention to regulatory matters. While the ETF has made progress, regulatory approval is not guaranteed, highlighting the intricate relationship between innovation and oversight.\n\nIf approved, the ETF could signify a crucial step in legitimizing not just Bitcoin but the entire cryptocurrency sector. However, it may also usher in a new era of regulatory scrutiny, as exemplified by recent SEC actions against crypto firms like Coinbase and Ripple.\n\nOn a global scale, BlackRock's participation could expand the investor base in the cryptocurrency market, making Bitcoin more accessible and elevating its status as a legitimate investment. Increased liquidity due to ETF investments might also influence Bitcoin's price dynamics.\n\nDespite optimism, the timeline for approval remains uncertain, with regulatory hurdles and the SEC's historical caution regarding Bitcoin ETFs introducing unpredictability. The crypto community awaits the unfolding of this pivotal moment and its impact on the future of digital assets.\n\nThe Ripple Effect: A More Comprehensive Cryptocurrency ETF Ecosystem?\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF, particularly by a financial behemoth like BlackRock, might kickstart a broader cryptocurrency ETF ecosystem. It may pave the way for ETFs that provide exposure to other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Litecoin, as well as diversified crypto baskets.\n\nFurthermore, the success of bitcoin ETFs in the United States may affect regulatory decisions in other parts of the world. In view of the changing situation, countries in Europe, Asia, and beyond may reevaluate their stance on cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nThis possible ripple effect could result in a broader and more diverse selection of bitcoin investment products available to investors worldwide. It would give investors more options and flexibility in how they get exposure to the digital asset class.\n\nConsiderations for Investors\n\nWhile the potential of a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF and a larger cryptocurrency ETF ecosystem is enticing, investors should proceed with prudence and full due diligence. Cryptocurrencies are notorious for their price volatility, and investing in this asset class is fraught with danger.\n\nBefore investing funds to bitcoin ETFs or digital assets directly, investors should examine aspects such as their risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall portfolio plan. Furthermore, maintaining up to date on regulatory developments and market dynamics is critical for making sound investing decisions.\n\nConclusion: A Watershed Moment\n\nThe proposal by BlackRock for a Bitcoin ETF has sparked debate over the future of cryptocurrency investments. If approved, it might be a watershed moment in cryptocurrency acceptance within established financial systems. As institutional interest in cryptocurrencies grows, the cryptocurrency landscape is fast shifting, presenting investors with both opportunities and challenges.\n\nWhile the fate of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF proposal is unknown, it represents an important step forward in the gradual integration of digital assets into conventional finance. Whether or whether this is the start of a larger trend, institutional participation in the cryptocurrency market is evident, and it is transforming the financial environment for the foreseeable future. Investors and industry participants are keenly anticipating the outcome of regulatory decisions that will define the future of bitcoin ETFs."

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s spectacular rise and fall in the cryptocurrency industry \u2014 a journey that included his testimony before Congress, a Super Bowl advertisement and dreams of a future run for president \u2014 hit rock bottom Thursday when a New York jury convicted him of fraud for stealing at least $10 billion from customers and investors.\n\nAfter the monthlong trial, jurors rejected Bankman-Fried\u2019s claim during testimony in Manhattan federal court that he never committed fraud or meant to cheat customers before FTX, once the world\u2019s second-largest crypto exchange, collapsed into bankruptcy a year ago.\n\n\u201cMr. Bankman-Fried. Please rise and face the jury,\u201d Judge Lewis A. Kaplan commanded just before a jury forewoman responded \u201cguilty\u201d seven times to two counts of wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud conspiracy and three other conspiracy charges, which carry potential penalties adding up to 110 years in prison. Bankman-Fried is likely to face far less than the maximum at a sentencing set for March 28.\n\nAs the verdict was read, Bankman-Fried seemed stunned, appearing stone-faced, his hands clasped before him, as his lawyers remained sitting beside him. When he sat down, he looked down for several minutes.\n\nHis lawyer, Mark Cohen, later read a statement outside court to say they \u201crespect the jury\u2019s decision. But we are very disappointed with the result.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Bankman Fried maintains his innocence and will continue to vigorously fight the charges against him,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams, who sat in the front row of the spectator section during the verdict, stood before cameras outside the courthouse and said Bankman-Fried \u201cperpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history, a multibillion dollar scheme designed to make him the king of crypto.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut here\u2019s the thing: The cryptocurrency industry might be new. The players like Sam Bankman-Fried might be new. This kind of fraud, this kind of corruption is as old as time and we have no patience for it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the case should serve as a warning to every other fraudster who \u201cthinks they\u2019re untouchable, that their crimes are too complex,\u201d that they are too powerful to prosecute or can talk their way out of their crimes because \u201cI promise we\u2019ll have enough handcuffs for all of them.\u201d\n\nThe jury rejected Bankman-Fried\u2019s insistence during three days of testimony that he never committed fraud or plotted to steal from customers, investors and lenders and didn\u2019t realize his companies were at least $10 billion in debt until October 2022.\n\nAfter the jury left the room, Bankman-Fried\u2019s parents, both Stanford University law professors, moved to the front row behind him. His father put his arm around his wife. As Bankman-Fried was led out of the courtroom, he looked back and nodded toward his mother, who nodded back and then became emotional, wiping her hand over her face after he left the room.\n\nThe trial attracted intense interest with its focus on a fraud on a scale not seen since the 2009 prosecution of Bernard Madoff, whose Ponzi scheme over decades cheated thousands of investors out of about $20 billion. Madoff pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 150 years in prison, where he died in 2021.\n\nThe prosecution of Bankman-Fried, 31, put a spotlight on the emerging industry of cryptocurrency and a group of young executives in their 20s who lived together in a $30 million luxury apartment in the Bahamas as they dreamed of becoming the most powerful player in a new financial field.\n\nProsecutors made sure jurors knew that the defendant they saw in court with short hair and a suit was not the man with big messy hair and shorts that became his trademark appearance after he started his cryptocurrency hedge fund, Alameda Research, in 2017 and FTX, his cryptocurrency exchange, two years later.\n\nThey showed the jury pictures of Bankman-Fried sleeping on a private jet, sitting with a deck of cards and mingling at the Super Bowl with celebrities including the singer Katy Perry. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos called Bankman-Fried someone who liked \u201ccelebrity chasing.\u201d\n\nIn a closing argument, Cohen said prosecutors were trying to turn \u201cSam into some sort of villain, some sort of monster.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s both wrong and unfair, and I hope and believe that you have seen that it\u2019s simply not true,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to the government, everything Sam ever touched and said was fraudulent.\u201d\n\nThe government relied heavily on the testimony of three former members of Bankman-Fried\u2019s inner circle, his top executives including his former girlfriend, Caroline Ellison, to explain how Bankman-Fried used Alameda Research to siphon billions of dollars from customer accounts at FTX.\n\nWith that money, prosecutors said, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate gained influence and power through investments, contributions, tens of millions of dollars in political contributions, Congressional testimony and a publicity campaign that enlisted celebrities like comedian Larry David and football quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nEllison, 28, testified that Bankman-Fried directed her while she was chief executive of Alameda Research to commit fraud as he pursued ambitions to lead huge companies, spend money influentially and run for U.S. president someday. She said he thought he had a 5% chance to eventually be U.S. president.\n\nBecoming tearful as she described the collapse of the cryptocurrency empire last November, Ellison said the revelations that caused customers collectively to demand their money back, exposing the fraud, brought a \u201crelief that I didn\u2019t have to lie anymore.\u201d\n\nFTX cofounder Gary Wang, who was FTX\u2019s chief technology officer, revealed in his testimony that Bankman-Fried directed him to insert code into FTX\u2019s operations so that Alameda Research could make unlimited withdrawals from FTX and have a credit line up to $65 billion. Wang said the money came from customers.\n\nNishad Singh, the former head of engineering at FTX, testified that he felt \u201cblindsided and horrified\u201d at the result of the actions of a man he once admired when he saw the extent of the fraud. He said the collapse last November left him suicidal.\n\nEllison, Wang and Singh all pleaded guilty to fraud charges and testified against Bankman-Fried in the hopes of leniency at sentencing.\n\nBankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas last December and extradited to the United States, where he was freed on a $250 million personal recognizance bond with electronic monitoring and a requirement that he remain at the home of his parents in Palo Alto, California.\n\nHis communications, including hundreds of phone calls with journalists and internet influencers, along with emails and texts, eventually got him in trouble when the judge concluded he was trying to influence prospective trial witnesses and ordered him jailed in August.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors used Bankman-Fried\u2019s public statements, online announcements and his Congressional testimony against him, showing how the entrepreneur repeatedly promised customers that their deposits were safe and secure as late as last Nov. 7 when he tweeted \u201cFTX is fine. Assets are fine\u201d as customers furiously tried to withdraw their money. He deleted the tweet the next day. FTX filed for bankruptcy four days later.\n\nIn his closing, Roos mocked Bankman-Fried\u2019s testimony, saying that under questioning from his lawyer, the defendant\u2019s words were \u201csmooth, like it had been rehearsed a bunch of times?\u201d\n\nBut under cross examination, \u201che was a different person,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cSuddenly on cross-examination he couldn\u2019t remember a single detail about his company or what he said publicly. It was uncomfortable to hear. He never said he couldn\u2019t recall during his direct examination, but it happened over 140 times during his cross-examination.\u201d\n\nFormer federal prosecutors said the quick verdict \u2014 after only half a day of deliberation \u2014 showed how well the government tried the case.\n\n\u201cThe government tried the case as we expected,\u201d said Joshua A. Naftalis, a partner at Pallas Partners LLP and a former Manhattan prosecutor. \u201cIt was a massive fraud, but that doesn\u2019t mean it had to be a complicated fraud, and I think the jury understood that argument.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Ken Sweet contributed from Palm Springs, California."

        "content": "00:00\n\nA verdict in the Sam Bankman-fried case. Being found guilty on seven counts of fraud. We'd love to hear your reaction to that ruling and what it potentially means for the crypto industry going forward. I think that it's an important milestone in the growth and the maturation of the industry. The crypto industry has been plagued by inexperienced entrepreneurs like Sam, unreliable custodians like RTX incompetent creditors. A dozen went bankrupt in the last year or two. Unscrupulous promoters and their failure is a necessary rite of passage for an industry that's going to lead to a new, more stable, more scalable ecosystem that will be based on Bitcoin. Public companies like BLOCK MicroStrategy Marathon, a dozen Bitcoin miners that are public institutional money managers like Fidelity and BlackRock and regulated banks when they eventually become custodians. The offshore crypto exchanges, the stablecoins, the crypto tokens, the defi projects they're going to shrink, fade into the background and decouple from mainstream and institutional digital assets marketplace that will be based on Bitcoin. And Michael, you bring up BlackRock, you bring up Fidelity, and of course both of those firms have applications in for a spot U.S. Bitcoin ETF, something that hasn't been approved yet. But there's a lot of speculation, a lot of optimism that it could be soon. What would that mean for MicroStrategy, given that? I mean, you've been on the record to saying that MicroStrategy shares are a proxy for Bitcoin. If you're able to get that through a physically backed ETF, would that lessen the premium that MicroStrategy enjoys? I think it's critical for there to be a spot ETF for mainstream retail investors and mainstream institutional investors to participate. So it's going to lay a base layer that's going to allow large amounts of capital to flow into the industry. MicroStrategy is a special investment vehicle for Bitcoin. Long balls were different from an ETF because we don't charge a fee. We can use intelligent leverage. We borrowed 2.2 billion at 1.6% interest to buy Bitcoin, and we can generate a tax deferred bitcoin premium either by using cash purchased by cash purchases or by capital markets activity. So we're not for everybody. And in sovereign wealth funds that want to buy $50 billion worth of Bitcoin can't fit into the MicroStrategy capital structure. But if you want leverage and this tax deferred yield and no fee, then we're an interesting alternative for people in the space with regards to building up that position, that that crypto position even further than what you have. Does the introduction of those ETFs, would that create competition to increase ASICs asset class asset sizes? Excuse me? I think it's going to help everybody in the space. They're going to accelerate education efforts and adoption. And already you can see fidelity analysts are making a huge impact on the digital asset space. So as you see Wall Street analysts from all these ETF firms and you see their education and marketing efforts come into the space and as they provide the rails for traditional institutional investors and endowments and the like to engage, they're going to expand their entire ecosystem, but they're not an operating company. They can't take on leverage. They can't not charge a fee. I mean, we literally don't charge a fee and they can't they can't engage in cash purchases with operating income like we can in order to generate that tax deferred Bitcoin premium. It's interesting to to see some of the moves in Bitcoin this year. Obviously, the volatility is still there, but not necessarily to the extremes that we saw in prior years. And I'm wondering if the introduction or the broadening out of the user base will reintroduce that volatility or have we kind of moved past that? Are we kind of in a different era now? Well, I think we've reached a nice point. But, you know, when Bitcoin plus past $100000 to $200000, maybe it'll trade from 250,000 down to 175,000. And people are going to be screaming the end again. So Bitcoin is is compounding at 40 to 50% annualized growth rate for the past three and a quarter years since MicroStrategy got into the space with a lot of volatility. I think an analyst, Timmer from Fidelity pointed out it is got the highest volatility of any asset, but it's also got the greatest return. And so as I've said in the past, volatility has vitality. I'd rather have the volatility and the performance than get rid of the volatility. Gold's not volatile, but it's also down 1% in three and a quarter years. So that's not what we're looking for. Michael, I want to talk a little bit more about the user base of crypto who's actually buying, because, of course, if you take a look at the trading market, you've seen trading volume absolutely fall off a clip. And the narrative I keep hearing is that you've had all these retail players flushed out after what we saw with FTC's a year ago. So maybe a spot Bitcoin ETF is in the offing, but do you think that that would actually bring back in those marginal buyers, those retail players, or have they been burned too badly? Yeah, I think that during this crypto meltdown, the crypto pros offshore and the leveraged hedge funds, they exited the space. They were all bankrupted for the most part. Right now the natural buyers in the space are Bitcoin Hodlers the maximalists the people that are sweeping their incremental cash flows into bitcoin. It's it's almost impossible, very difficult for mainstream investors and mainstream retail to buy Bitcoin because there are just very few on ramps. So the natural sellers are the miners, the natural buyers of the hodlers, the trading volume has diminished quite a bit. This is the long before the storm. Once we get these ETFs in place, that will open up the gateway for mainstream retail and mainstream institutional capital to flow. And the halving in April is going to cut the available supply in half, and it's going to eliminate half of the natural selling. So this next four month period is very pivotal to the asset class. I want to talk to you about your own Bitcoin holdings, and I have a very detailed question for you. I have to give credit to Tom Trillionowe in our newsroom for this. If you take a look at page 21 of the latest 10-Q, it mentions that MicroStrategy could raise just over $600 million in an ATM equity offering. Is that something you're thinking about tapping? You take a look at the shares. Right now, they're up over 200% year to date. Could you use that to add more to your Bitcoin funds here? We have raised more than $1,000,000,000 in the past via ATM offerings, and whenever we did it, it was accretive to our shareholders. This $600 million vehicle will allow us to engage in more capital markets activity. You know, as we're selling stock at a premium and then buying the underlying Bitcoin, we're capturing a tax deferred Bitcoin premium for our common stock shareholders. So we're very thoughtful about when we do that and how we do that. And sometimes we'll do it, sometimes we want it depends on market conditions and, you know, and where everything trades."

        "content": "Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) were trading relatively flat during Friday\u2019s trading session on lower-than-average volume despite the general market surging following the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision Wednesday to hold interest rates steady.\n\nThe three popular cryptos have been consolidating since Oct. 24, after Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin surged on hopes the Security and Exchange Commission is close to approving a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint, the cryptos have been consolidating near highly important technical levels, with Bitcoin trading under strong resistance at the $36,000 mark and Ethereum and Dogecoin moving horizontally above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).\n\nThe 200-day SMA is an important bellwether. Technical traders and investors consider a stock trading above the level on the daily chart to be in a bull cycle, whereas a stock trading under the 200-day SMA is considered to be in a bear cycle.\n\nThe 50-day SMA also plays an important role in technical analysis, especially when paired with the 200-day. When the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA, a death cross occurs whereas when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day, a bullish golden cross takes place.\n\nWant direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.\n\nThe Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin has been consolidating sideways on lower-than-average volume, while rejecting the important $36,000 mark on each attempt. The consolidation has been taking place on declining volume, which is often followed by a burst in high volume.\n\nThe sideways consolidation is helping to lower Bitcoin\u2019s relative strength index (RSI), which has been trading above the 70% level since Oct. 19. When a stock\u2019s or crypto\u2019s RSI is above 70%, it\u2019s considered to be overbought, which can be a sell signal for technical traders.\n\nBullish traders want to see Bitcoin\u2019s RSI continue to lower and then for big bearish volume to come in and break the crypto up through $36,000, which could accelerate a move to the upside toward $40,000. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and break Bitcoin down below the eight-day exponential moving average, which would negate the crypto\u2019s current uptrend.\n\nIt should be noted that a golden cross, which occurs when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day, formed on Bitcoin\u2019s chart on Oct. 29, which suggests the crypto is in a strong bull cycle.\n\nBitcoin has resistance above at $35,593 and at $38,105 and support below at $31,862 and at $31,418.\n\nThe Ethereum and Dogecoin Charts: Ethereum and Dogecoin have been consolidating sideways near the 200-day SMA, with Ethereum trading sideways above that area and Dogecoin under it. Both Ethereum and Dogecoin have been consolidating near the 200-day on decreasing volume, which like Bitcoin, indicates a larger move in one direction is on the horizon.\n\nWhile Ethereum is trading in an uptrend within its consolidating pattern, Dogecoin is trading in a tightening range, forming a triangle formation. If the cryptos break bullishly from their respective patterns, a more powerful move to the upside could be in the cards.\n\nBearish traders want to see Ethereum break down under the 200-day SMA and for Dogecoin to break down from the lower ascending trendline of the triangle. If either of those two things happens, downside pressure is likely to accelerate.\n\nEthereum has resistance above at $1,825 and at $1,937 and support below at $1,717 and at $1,615.\n\nDogecoin has resistance above at $0.069 and at $0.075 and support below at $0.065 and at $0.061.\n\nRead Next: Jack Dorsey's Block And Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy Are Both Big On Bitcoin \u2014 But Here's The Real Winner - MicroStrategy\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "In the past decade, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have put up superb total returns (including dividends) of 186% and 260%, respectively.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency market has produced an even bigger winner: Bitcoin (BTC -3.46%). The world's most valuable digital asset has skyrocketed in the last decade. Its current price of roughly $34,600 (as of Oct. 31) is almost 17,000% higher than it was on this same day 10 years ago.\n\nThis means a relatively small investment of $1,000 back then would be worth $168,000 today. Good luck finding a better performing asset than that!\n\nLet's take a closer look at what has helped drive this top cryptocurrency throughout its history. And then, by assessing things from today's perspective, investors can figure out if Bitcoin should be in their portfolios right now.\n\nA new form of money\n\nUnlike most financial assets that start off with institutional adoption, Bitcoin was unique in that its early supporters were individuals, mostly computer scientists who valued privacy and autonomy more than anything. And it makes sense why they thought this way.\n\nBitcoin was launched about 15 years ago on the heels of the Great Recession as a new form of money that wasn't controlled by anybody. Seeing the turmoil caused by the subprime mortgage crisis, the massive bailouts that occurred, and the unprecedented stimulative efforts by governments, Bitcoin's pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, created a solution. And the first cryptocurrency was born.\n\nTo be clear, Bitcoin has mainly been viewed as an investment vehicle up until now for those seeking financial gains, as opposed to actually being used in transactions. In fact, since the network can only process five transactions per second, some wonder if this cryptocurrency will ever have greater utility.\n\nNonetheless, it's hard to argue with Bitcoin's astronomical price rise historically. While it's an extremely volatile asset, it has always reached higher highs. Right now, it's about 50% below its peak price from November 2021.\n\nAnd to show how much progress Bitcoin has made, it's worth looking at the expansive infrastructure of supporting products and services out there. Bitcoin-only businesses provide Bitcoin individual retirement accounts and loans backed by the digital coin. Coinbase Global, PayPal Holdings, and Block give individuals and institutions the ability to buy and sell it. There are Bitcoin-focused payments companies. And many well-known businesses accept it as payment.\n\nBitcoin has also found its way into the portfolios of large corporations and billionaire fund managers. El Salvador even accepts it as legal tender within its borders. Over time, this growing interest has certainly helped propel the crypto's price.\n\nIs now the right time to buy Bitcoin?\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that the next 10 years for Bitcoin won't come close to resembling the past. If this crypto would have the same compound annual growth rate that it did in the last decade, its market cap would be a ridiculous $114 trillion by November 2033. That's simply unrealistic.\n\nBut this doesn't mean it isn't a worthwhile investment right now. As I noted earlier, its current price is well below its all-time high, so buying the dip is an option, with the hope that it will reach a newer high once again, like it has always done.\n\nThere is also a major catalyst on the horizon. In another sign that the cryptocurrency is slowly becoming more mainstream, the approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission of spot exchange-traded funds is viewed by industry experts as inevitable. The only question is when. This could open the floodgates to lots of institutional capital flowing to Bitcoin.\n\nInvestors who believe in this crypto's prospects should seriously consider adding a tiny allocation to their portfolios."

        "content": "More tradition than coincidence, the Christmas season is around the corner again and the market is looking good for yet another run. Bitcoin (BTC) surged to more than $35,000 in October, another record high for 2023. The year-long rally has been attributed to unconventional market trends, including excitement over the Bitcoin spot ETF applications pending with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIf, like me, you've been in the crypto space since 2014, you'd agree that the holiday season comes with a euphoric feeling \u2014 especially this year. Everyone seems to agree that a bull run is just around the corner, so it\u2019s time to keep a watchful eye on the market and explore unique opportunities in more than one niche \u2014 and to contemplate your approach to trading.\n\nA conventional Christmas rally?\n\nChristmas rallies bring excitement and joy to many in the crypto scene. Historically, the season brings an uptick in trade volumes, significant market movements, and price surges. However, recent years have defied convention, with market dynamics influenced by unprecedented factors. Take the global pandemic in 2020, for example, along with Elon Musk's tweets in 2021 and 2022. Cryptocurrencies have soared for reasons no one could predict.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin beyond 35K for Christmas? Thank Jerome Powell if it happens\n\nPredicting crypto market behavior is akin to forecasting the weather. It's a challenging endeavor. While past years have brought December delights, this season is influenced by far more complex factors, including regulatory developments and geopolitical tensions.\n\nNever mind ETFs \u2014 Bitcoin\u2019s halving lies ahead\n\nInvestors have been positioning themselves in anticipation of a greenlight from the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF. The theory here is that an ETF will bring in institutional investors to crypto.\n\nThere is also the euphoria that Bitcoin's upcoming halving event has brought to the market. The Bitcoin halving event \u2014 scheduled to occur in April 2024 \u2014 is significant. It\u2019s tied to Bitcoin's finite supply of 21 million coins. The apex cryptocurrency is issued primarily through mining. Bitcoin's halving refers to the mechanism by which the number of new Bitcoin created in each block is reduced by 50%. It occurs every 210,000 blocks (or roughly every four years). The halving ensures Bitcoin remains a scarce and highly sought-after asset.\n\nBITCOIN to $100k. Saying for years gold&silver GOD\u2019S money. BITCOIN peoples $. Bad news IF stock & bond market crash gold&silver skyrocket. WORSE NEWS IF world economy crashes BC $1 million Gold $ 75K silver to $60k. SAVERS of FAKE US $ F\u2019d. DEBT too high. Mom, Pop & kids in\u2026 \u2014 Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) August 14, 2023\n\nThe upcoming halving has led to big predictions for Bitcoin\u2019s price. \u201cRich Dad, Poor Dad\u201d author Robert Kiyosaki believes it will hit at least $100,000. Max Keiser is forecasting a new all-time high of $220,000. MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor is \u2014 as always \u2014 extremely bullish, envisioning a price of $1 million. The predictions are based on both historical trends and social influences. These and other unconventional forces were behind the rally we witnessed in October.\n\nIn my opinion, Bitcoin could comfortably break its all-time high of $69,000, and possibly surpass $169,000.\n\nWhat happens if an ETF isn\u2019t approved?\n\nAnalysts at financial services firm JPMorgan have suggested that if the SEC rejects the ETF applications before it, it could lead to legal action by the applicants. A court already ruled in Grayscale\u2019s favor against the SEC in August, paving the way for Grayscale to convert its Bitcoin trust into a spot ETF. BlackRock, Cathie Wood\u2018s ARK Invest, and other firms are also in the race to win ETF approvals.\n\nI'm sure it will be much more boring than this -- but sometimes it does feel like this is all a setup for a giant Gensler semi-comedic rug-pull. \u2014 Dave Nadig (@DaveNadig) October 30, 2023\n\nMultiple spot Bitcoin ETFs could be approved within months. At least for now, it seems inevitable, if not imminent.\n\nConflict in the Middle East\n\nGeopolitical tensions and outright wars are a wildcard in the world of cryptocurrencies. The ongoing Middle East conflict between Israel and Hamas is a stark reminder of how external factors can ripple into the market. While the immediate implications may not be clear, historically, investors seek refuge in alternative assets \u2014including cryptocurrencies\u2014 during global crises. So far, the war hasn't affected the crypto market, but as the situation unfolds, the market could see shifts in sentiment and capital flow.\n\nThree days after the breakout of the war, crypto prices fell and the price of oil surged after being affected by traders speculating that the war may disrupt supplies if it spread to neighboring nations like Iran. The world's busiest shipping routes like the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and the Suez Canal have their home in the Middle East. This further heightens fear of an economic peril if the situation escalates to these places.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin is evolving into a multiasset network\n\nAn expansion of the war into the Sinai Peninsula and Suez region \u201dincreases the risks of an attack on energy and non-energy trade flowing through the Suez Canal,\u201d the Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Pat Thaker noted in a comment to CNBC, \u201cand that accounts for almost 15% of global trade, almost 45% of crude oil, 9% of refined, and also 8% of LNG tankers transit through that route.\"\n\nThere has been no significant effect on the crypto market so far, but if the conflict keeps escalating, it could result in heightened price sensitivity as we enter the Christmas season.\n\nAltcoin season?\n\nTraders eagerly ponder the possibility of an \u201caltcoin\u201d season happening as festive seasons approach. Based on historical data (where we've seen previous alt-seasons happen in December 2017 and January 2021), we might see this run start more seriously in December. I am banking on the next alt-season to run from December (aided by Bitcoin ETF approvals) and to last until Bitcoin\u2019s halving in April.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Bitcoin will stall at a relatively consistent level until an ETF is approved \u2014 which means it may not be a bad time to start looking at altcoins. I am particularly keen on niche sectors including GameFi and tokenized real-world assets (RWA). (Obligatory disclaimer: I have been wrong in the past, and I might be wrong again.) When altcoin season does begin, tokens with valuable use cases in these areas could be at the forefront of this run.\n\nThis Christmas season holds the promise of a crypto bull run, but the path remains uncertain. The ETF debacle, global tensions, and the potential for altcoins all demand watchful vigilance. We can't always predict the future, but we can prepare for it by staying informed, managing risk, and seizing strategic opportunities. It's not just about celebrating the holidays \u2014 it's about embracing the future of finance in the ever-exciting crypto world.\n\nEvan Luthra is a 28-year-old cryptocurrency entrepreneur who sold his first company, StudySocial, for $1.7 million at 17 and had developed over 30 mobile apps before he was 18.

        "content": "Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) volatility has been dealing a heavy blow to crypto markets. Miller Value Partners Portfolio Manager Bill Miller IV joins Yahoo Finance Live to shed more light on bitcoin's trading resiliency despite various crypto headwinds.\n\n\"Bitcoin is very different from crypto, crypto was convicted yesterday,\" Miller states, referencing former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's fraud conviction. \"Bitcoin is going very very strong, the network is as strong as it's ever been.\"\n\nMiller anticipates positive long-term trends for bitcoin despite its recent volatility, citing it's appeal as an \"uncensorable\" asset.\n\nClick here to watch the full interview on the Yahoo Finance YouTube page or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Volatility in the cryptocurrency is putting a dent in the exchanges that hold it. Coinbase saw trading volumes sink in its third quarter amid volatile trading sessions for the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy had to write down more than $33 million in its most recent quarter, thanks to the falling coin price since its November 2021 peak.\n\nOur next guest has remained a Bitcoin bull despite the fluctuating price and scandals in the crypto sector, like Sam Bankman-Fried's recent fraud conviction. Let's bring in Bill Miller IV, Miller Value Partners Portfolio Manager.\n\nBill, good to talk to you today. Let me get your reaction, first of all, to the verdict that was handed down. What this, ultimately, means for crypto as a whole?\n\nBILL MILLER: Well, I think it's really important that we differentiate between Bitcoin and crypto. So crypto was convicted yesterday on seven counts of fraud. Lying to people about what you're doing with their money is wrong.\n\nThe beauty of Bitcoin is that's not an issue. There is a very clear digital ledger maintained by computers and a very clear protocol out there that's visible for everyone to see. Bitcoin is very different from crypto.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo crypto was convicted yesterday. Bitcoin is still going very, very strong. The networks are strong as it's ever been. There's more users than there's ever been. So we continue to see very positive trends in Bitcoin, not so much in crypto.\n\nBRAD SMITH: What is the most positive trend? And do you believe that it's largely-- especially with some of the price action that we've seen recently that seems to have been driven, not so much by what's taking place in trials, but more so by some of the ETFs that could be set for approval?\n\nBILL MILLER: Yeah. I think the big picture trend is that Bitcoin is the best performing asset in nine of the past 12 years. It's been up three out of four years. People tend to focus on the very short-term fluctuations and the volatility. But the reality is, there's a real demand globally for an uncensorable asset, where the regulators can't change the rules and the measuring stick over time.\n\nSo I think another thing that's driven Bitcoin's appreciation recently is the massive debts we're racking up in the US. Deficits are going up. Debts are going up. And someone's going to have to pay for that. Ultimately, it's going to come from money printing."

        "title": "Bitcoin Santa Claus Rally: How Often Does the Christmas Miracle Occur in Crypto | Credit: Shutterstock - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe Santa Claus Rally refers to seasonal upticks in asset prices during late December through early January.\n\nWhile there\u2019s a clear correlation between market sentiment and price action, it\u2019s not always linear.\n\nNegative sentiments can sometimes lead to significant price increases, suggesting contrarian investment strategies might be effective.\n\nSentiments like \u201cOptimism Anxiety\u201d and \u201cBelief Denial\u201d show the most varied actions, indicating these might be the most uncertain periods for Bitcoin investors.\n\nThe Santa Claus Rally is a phenomenon occurring in traditional stock markets, often observed as a surge in stock prices during the final weeks of December through the first couple trading days of mid-January.\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s 24/7 trading environment, this article aims to explore if the price of Bitcoin really does lean bullish as seen in conventional markets over the Santa Claus Rally period. The following article will therefore try to see if a hypothetical purchase of Bitcoin on christmas day is more likely to see short term gains or not into January.\n\nWhy Does Santa Claus Rally Exist?\n\nThe \u201cSanta Claus Rally\u201d often occurs due to several developments that happen towards the end of the year, such factors include:\n\nTax Considerations\n\nInvestors may be adjusting their portfolios for tax purposes at the end of the year. Actively selling or buying to record advantageous tax losses or free up cash to pay tax obligations.\n\nHoliday Optimism\n\nThe general optimism and good cheer around the holiday season might make traders more bullish.\n\nWindow Dressing\n\nThis refers to the practice where fund managers add well-performing stocks to their portfolios at the end of the year to improve the appearance of year-end reports.\n\nLow Trading Volume\n\nMany traders and institutional investors are away on vacation, leading to lower trading volume, which can result in exaggerated stock price movements.\n\nAnticipation of the January Effect\n\nThis is another seasonal trading pattern where stocks, especially small caps, tend to perform well in January. Some investors might buy stocks in December in anticipation of this rally.\n\nSanta Claus Rally: Bitcoin Historical Analysis\n\nTo judge the potential existence and profitability of the Bitcoin Santa Claus Rally, specific time frames and price movement percentages were taken into consideration. During this same period, market sentiment is also highlighted using the Net Unrealised Profit and Loss (NUPL chart) on LookIntoBitcoin.\n\nThe NUPL uses on-chain data to demonstrate potential market participant emotions at a given moment in time which can be useful for forecasting Bitcoin price and where it may move next over time.\n\nKey Considerations To Understand The Bitcoin Santa Rally\n\nTime Frame\n\nAnalysis primarily revolves around the months of December until mid-January. With a hypothetical entry price on the 25th of December and a timeline horizon of three to four weeks.\n\nInitial Action\n\nTaking a hypothetical \u201cbuy\u201d action on Christmas Day.\n\nBuy Signal Criteria\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s price rises by at least 10% at least once, within one to four weeks after Christmas, it\u2019s categorized as a \u201cBuy\u201d signal.\n\nSell Signal Criteria\n\nA decline in price by more than 10% during the same period post-Christmas day indicates a \u201cSell\u201d signal.\n\nNeutral Position\n\nIf the price remains relatively stable, fluctuating within a 10% range, it\u2019s deemed \u201cNeutral.\u201d\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nUtilizing the NUPL chart from LookIntoBitcoin, this analysis compares the market sentiment during the festive season to understand the underlying mood and confidence levels of investors versus a buy, sell or neutral stance.\n\nThis multi-faceted approach not only evaluates the price patterns but also delves into the psychological state of the market during the festive season. After analyzing this on-chain data versus price action some observations can be made.\n\nData Analysis\n\nBefore analyzing the price action versus the christmas period it is important to note that this analysis only takes into account a hypothetical short term horizon trade starting on Christmas day and closing around mid-January.\n\nData Results\n\nSentiment and Action Correlation:\n\nEuphoria\n\nIn 2013 and 2010, the market sentiment was in a euphoric state which resulted in a Santa Rally throughout christmas and mid-January and hence a \u201cBuy\u201d opportunity, suggesting that extreme optimism in the short run, over the christmas period, resulted in a short term gain.\n\nCapitulation\n\nIn all three occurrences in the years 2022, 2014, 2011, this sentiment led to two \u201cBuy\u201d actions and one \u201cSell\u201d action. This indicates that while despair often leads to selling, it can also be seen as a fantastic buying opportunity.\n\nBelief Denial\n\nAppeared four times in 2021, 2020, 2017, 2012. Interestingly, despite the sentiment of denial, the actions were split between \u201cBuy\u201d and \u201cSell,\u201d indicating market unpredictability during these periods.\n\nOptimism Anxiety\n\nOccurred three times in 2019, 2016, 2015. The actions varied, between \u201cBuy\u201d, \u201cSell\u201d and \u201cNeutral\u201d suggesting that mixed feelings of optimism and anxiety lead to diverse market reactions.\n\nHope Fear\n\nAppeared once in 2018 with a \u201cNeutral\u201d action, suggesting that when the market is torn between hope and fear, investors might prefer to stay on the sidelines.\n\nBitcoin Price Movement Analysis Over The Santa Claus Rally Period\n\nBullish Price Movement\n\nThe highest price increase (65%) was observed in 2011, during a \u201cCapitulation\u201d sentiment, suggesting that sometimes the greatest buying opportunities come during periods of maximum pessimism.\n\nAnalyzing the data from the past decade reveals some interesting patterns. Over the specified period, Bitcoin exhibited a bullish Santa rally, characterized by a price surge of at least 10%, on six occasions, in the years 2022, 2020, 2019, 2013, 2012, 2011 with the average increase being 31% which is quite a significant move and opportunity for a quick trade in such a short period of time.\n\nBearish Price Movement\n\nContrarily, there were four instances where Bitcoin\u2019s price dipped by more than 10%, indicating the absence of the anticipated Santa Claus Rally reliance. These instances occurred in the years 2021, 2017, 2015, 2014, with the average drop in price being 21%. This means that in specific years the Santa Bitcoin Rally will not materialize and a purchase on christmas day can see a trade fall 21% on average, in price within just three to four weeks.\n\nNeutral Price Movement\n\nFurthermore, the market remained relatively stable during two specific years, with price fluctuations contained within a modest 10% range, suggesting a neutral stance during those festive seasons. This analysis underscores the dynamic nature of Bitcoin\u2019s performance during the year-end, with a mix of bullish, bearish, and neutral outcomes. With a slight edge towards a bullish posture on average and consistently acting in a volatile nature.\n\nSentiment And Price Movement Correlation\n\nDuring years marked by \u201cEuphoria,\u201d Bitcoin experienced notable surges, underscoring the confidence investors felt.\n\nSimilarly, periods characterized by \u201cOptimism Anxiety\u201d a mix of hope and caution also leaned towards price appreciation, suggesting that even in times of uncertainty, a latent optimism often drives the market upward.\n\nIn a nutshell, whilst the past is not always a reflection of the future, positive sentiments like \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cOptimism Anxiety\u201d often correlate with price increases, suggesting a strong sentiment-price relationship.\n\nSentiments like \u201cCapitulation\u201d and \u201cBelief Denial\u201d showed varied price movements, indicating other external factors might be at play during these periods.\n\nSome years marked by \u201cCapitulation\u201d saw price rebounds, hinting at contrarian investment behaviors, while others witnessed declines. Similarly, \u201cBelief Denial\u201d periods have been unpredictable, with both rallies and downturns.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Potential Santa Claus Rally in 2023/2024: A Technical Insight\n\nAs the end of 2023 approaches, the crypto community is anticipating a potential Bitcoin Santa Claus Rally.\n\nBitcoin Bullish Catalysts for 2023/2024\n\nBitcoin Halving\n\nBitcoin is on the cusp of its next halving event, in April 2024. Historically, halvings have acted as significant bullish catalysts, reducing the supply of new bitcoins entering the market and creating a supply-side squeeze which might drive price increases in christmas time.\n\nETF Approval on the Horizon\n\nThe crypto community is eagerly awaiting the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF. If approved, this could usher in a wave of institutional investment, further propelling demand. The timing of the ETF may come during the christmas period.\n\nGeo-Macro Events\n\nThe global stage is full of events that could potentially bolster Bitcoin\u2019s appeal as a \u2018safe-haven\u2019 asset, especially in the face of economic uncertainties.\n\nSentiment Shifts\n\nCurrently, the market sentiment hovers in the \u201coptimism anxiety\u201d phase, a mix of hope and caution as can be seen below.\n\nThis sentiment is reflective of the market\u2019s anticipation of the above fundamentals, coupled with the memories of the 2022 bear market. However, as the world inches closer to the festive season, projections indicate a possible shift towards the \u201cbelief denial\u201d phase. This phase often sees the market in a state of internal conflict.\n\nWhat The Current Sentiment And Price Action Is Hinting In Relation To A Potential Bitcoin Santa Claus Rally\n\nAssuming sentiment shifts towards the \u201cbelief denial\u201d sentiment, Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory during the festive season could swing in any direction \u2013 bullish, bearish, or neutral. However, when analyzing past price data and considering the unique number of bullish events on the horizon, there\u2019s a strong case for a bullish rally.\n\nThe combination of the halving, potential ETF approval, and the prevailing sentiment suggests that Bitcoin might indeed witness a Santa Claus Rally, ending 2023 on a high note and ushering in a promising start until mid-January 2024.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while sentiment undeniably plays a significant role in shaping Bitcoin\u2019s price movements, it\u2019s clear that it doesn\u2019t operate in isolation. The interplay of various external factors, from global economic conditions and regulatory shifts to technological advancements, intertwines with market sentiment.\n\nThis intricate relationship introduces multiple layers of complexity, making Bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory a multifaceted phenomenon that goes beyond mere sentiment analysis or Santa Claus Rallies. Having said that during this Santa Rally period Bitcoin does seem to be quite volatile and trading opportunities tend to surface more often than not.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is the Santa Claus Rally in traditional markets?\n\nThe Santa Claus Rally refers to a seasonal uptick in stock prices typically observed from late December through the early days to mid-January. This phenomenon is attributed to various factors, including year-end tax considerations, holiday optimism, and anticipation of the January Effect.\n\nHow does the Santa Claus Rally relate to Bitcoin?\n\nGiven Bitcoin\u2019s 24/7 trading environment, there\u2019s interest in whether it mirrors the bullish trend seen in traditional markets during this period. By analyzing historical data, one can determine if buying Bitcoin on Christmas Day often leads to short-term gains into January.\n\nHow is market sentiment analyzed during the Santa Rally for Bitcoin?\n\nMarket sentiment during the festive season is taken using the Net Unrealised Profit and Loss (NUPL) chart on LookIntoBitcoin. This tool uses on-chain data to reflect potential market participant emotions, providing insights into Bitcoin\u2019s price direction.\n\nHave there been consistent patterns in Bitcoin\u2019s Santa Claus Rally?\n\nHistorical analysis reveals mixed outcomes. While Bitcoin has shown bullish trends in certain years, there have also been instances of significant price drops or neutral movements. Sentiments like \u201cEuphoria\u201d often correlate with price increases, while sentiments like \u201cCapitulation\u201d show varied results.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information provided in the article on Bitcoin\u2019s Santa Claus Rally is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as trading or investment advice.

        "title": "Are These Bitcoin Mining Stocks a Sneaky Way to Profit From the Boom in AI? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The soaring price of Bitcoin (BTC -3.46%), now up more than 100% year to date, has catapulted Bitcoin mining stocks into the stratosphere. The biggest Bitcoin mining stocks, such as Riot Platforms (RIOT -8.65%) and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA -10.51%), are now up more than 180% for the year as investors race to find companies that are highly leveraged to the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBut this single-minded focus on the price of Bitcoin may be missing a developing new story in the Bitcoin mining industry: the conversion of Bitcoin computing infrastructure into artificial intelligence (AI) computing infrastructure. Yes, that's right, a growing number of Bitcoin miners are looking to profit from the AI boom, although many investors have little idea this is happening. Here's what you need to know.\n\nWho's making the move into AI?\n\nTwo different Bitcoin miners caught my attention recently, and not for how much Bitcoin they were mining, how many new Bitcoin mining facilities they were launching, or how many new super-powerful Bitcoin mining rigs they were buying. Instead, they were announcing major moves to convert some of their Bitcoin computing infrastructure into AI computing infrastructure.\n\nThe two companies I have in mind are Bit Digital (BTBT -6.44%) and Hive Digital Technologies (HIVE -4.47%). In October, Hive Digital released further details on its plans to diversify into AI computing. The company is converting 38,000 Nvidia data center graphics processing units (GPUs), previously used to mine crypto, into an on-demand cloud service capable of servicing AI clients. Also in October, Bit Digital released plans to diversify into AI. The company plans to buy $35 million of new GPUs to service AI clients, with the aim of generating future cash flows to support its core mining operation.\n\nWhy the move into AI?\n\nThe biggest question, of course, is why these Bitcoin miners want to move into AI computing. After all, Bitcoin mining right now is incredibly profitable. The more Bitcoin they can mine, the more money they can make. And with the price of Bitcoin rebounding, they are quite literally minting money (if you consider cryptocurrency to be a form of money).\n\nBut there's an important consideration: The Bitcoin mining industry is incredibly cyclical and highly leveraged to the price of Bitcoin. Thus, in any year when Bitcoin is losing value, Bitcoin miners are highly unprofitable. For that reason, Bitcoin miners have always sought to diversify their businesses, which usually includes selling a mix of IT services to third-party clients.\n\nAnd don't forget about the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which CNBC has called an \"extinction-level event\" for the Bitcoin mining industry. This halving, which takes place in April 2024, will reduce the reward for mining Bitcoin by half. Put another way, Bitcoin miners will make only half as much as they did this year because their rewards are being cut by 50%.\n\nIt's easy to see why the halving event could force Bitcoin miners to seek a new strategic direction. Unless these miners dramatically boost their computing capacity or the price of Bitcoin doubles, they are likely going to be losing money in 2024. Some will surely go out of business unless they make changes now.\n\nPlus, did I mention that selling AI computing power is incredibly profitable -- at least for now? Bit Digital, for example, says that a new AI computing contract could generate as much as $250 million in revenue over a three-year period. By way of comparison, in all of 2022, Bit Digital posted just $32 million in Bitcoin mining revenue. And Hive Digital Technologies says that its new computing business is currently generating 15 times more revenue per megawatt than Bitcoin.\n\nBut will it work?\n\nGiven these numbers, it seems expanding into AI computing infrastructure could be a very profitable strategy. This assumes, of course, that AI computing power will continue to be in high demand, and that Bitcoin miners won't have to take on too much debt to finance the purchase of new computing equipment or retrofit existing infrastructure. If all goes according to plan (which it rarely does), Bitcoin mining stocks might have found a very clever way to remain profitable, even when the current rally in Bitcoin ends.\n\nHowever, if there's one caveat here, it's that investors have to be careful about investing in companies that are reinventing themselves to jump on an investment bandwagon. We've seen this before, with companies going to great lengths to cash in on an emerging technology only to see it flop. The metaverse immediately comes to mind.\n\nSo if you're thinking of investing in a Bitcoin mining stock, make sure you do your due diligence. The next time these miners report earnings, take a closer look at how much money they are actually making from their noncore (i.e., non-Bitcoin) businesses and whether their future growth projections seem feasible."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) continues to circle its highest levels in 18 months, and bullish BTC price predictions are flowing in \u2014 how high can the bull market go and how fast?\n\nFrom a crash to $20,000 to six figures within months, there is plenty of variety when it comes to what Bitcoin might do next, with November traditionally one of its most volatile months.\n\nBTC/USD monthly returns (screenshot). Source: CoinGlass\n\nThe mood among crypto traders and analysts has improved over the past month after \u201cUptober\u201d delivered nearly 30% BTC price gains.\n\nCointelegraph looks at five of the most popular targets for 2024 and beyond.

It was based on a handful of in-house models, with Matrixport also successfully predicting Bitcoin\u2019s October gains.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is breaking above the July $31,500 resistance level, showing that $45,000 is achievable by year-end,\u201d it summarized.\n\nBTC/USD currently trades at around $34,500, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, meaning that the end-of-year level requires another 30% push.\n\nBTC/USD 1-week chart.

Yes, it's going to reach a new all-time high before the halving. No, BTC is not going to $160K because the magnitude of every pullback is large. This means it will peak after the halving, in 2024. And yes, the target price is around $250K.\u201d\n\nBoth the all-time high and the post-halving $250,000 target came courtesy of Elliott Wave charting, with Bitcoin mimicking behavior from previous cycles.\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart.

Additionally, there will be two more pullbacks after the halving, which are not demonstrated here,\u201d he added in X interactions.\n\nThree BTC price models, one $130,000 target zone\n\nBitcoin all-time high predictions are not only coming from individual market participants \u2014 BTC price models are also flipping bullish.\n\nLast month, Cointelegraph reported on a range of forecasting tools, which are all focusing on an area of around $130,000 per Bitcoin.\n\nThese come from popular analyst CryptoCon, who nonetheless believes that a six-figure BTC price may take two years to become a reality.\n\n\u201cI am prepared for lower prices, but the stars are aligning at 130k for Bitcoin this cycle!\u201d he wrote in an X thread on the model data.\n\nThe concept also hinges on halving events, and the next peak should come around four years after the $69,000 move in November 2021.\n\nBitcoin price model based on halving cycles.

        "title": "Two years after peak crypto, Bitcoin has faded from the political conversation - CBC.ca",
        "content": "Almost two years after reaching all-time highs in value, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have faded from prominence in Canadian politics.\n\nThey also no longer appear on the public asset disclosure forms of several members of Parliament \u2014 including Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, once one of crypto's most prominent supporters in the political sphere.\n\nThe Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner publicizes summaries of disclosures made by all MPs. Those disclosures list assets like cryptocurrency if their value is greater than $10,000. As recently as February, Poilievre disclosed ownership of shares in a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, Purpose Bitcoin.\n\nBut in his most recent disclosure in September, Poilievre no longer lists the asset. The Conservative leader may have sold the shares, or their overall value may have fallen below $10,000, which would eliminate the need to disclose them publicly.\n\nPoilievre's office did not respond to several requests for comment from CBC News on the leader's personal holdings or current position on cryptocurrency.\n\nAs Poilievre campaigned for the Tory leadership on the way to a landslide victory, he spoke positively about decentralized finance and cryptocurrency. At one point, he argued that crypto would allow Canadians to \"opt-out\" of inflation, which was soaring at the time. And he famously used Bitcoin to purchase a shawarma at a London, Ont., restaurant in March 2022.\n\nCryptocurrency assets have also disappeared from the disclosure forms of several other MPs who previously held them, including Conservatives Ben Lobb and Tony Van Bynen and Liberal Chandra Arya (who still holds stock options in cryptoexchange company Coinbase).\n\nA number of MPs do still disclose personal crypto holdings. They include Liberal Jo\u00ebl Lightbound (who chairs a parliamentary committee that studied cryptoassets) and Conservative Ryan Williams.\n\nPierre Poilievre pays for his order in bitcoin at Tahini's Mediterranean restaurant in London, Ont., in March 2022. (Pierre Poilievre/Twitter)\n\nPeaking in value in November 2021 at over $80,000, Bitcoin's price subsequently fell by almost three quarters to just over $21,000 at its lowest point in the last year. It has since rebounded in part, reaching around $48,000 this month.\n\nExperts in cryptocurrency technology and regulation told CBC News that media and political attention in cryptocurrencies tracks closely with the price of the assets. Many cryptocurrencies have surged by around 30 per cent in the past month.\n\n\"It happens all the time,\" said Jeremy Clark, an associate professor at Concordia University who specializes in blockchain technology. \"Price goes up, it's all over the news. It goes away, then two years later it goes back up.\"\n\nHappy 15th anniversary to Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s historic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin</a> Whitepaper! <br><br>\"The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bitcoin</a>\ufffc whitepaper is one of the most seminal works of Computer Science in the last 30 years.\" - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jack</a> Dorsey <a href=\"https://t.co/MbZszmfqRe\">pic.twitter.com/MbZszmfqRe</a> \u2014@JoelLightbound\n\nFar less discussion of crypto than last year\n\nCryptocurrency broke into the Canadian political mainstream over the past several years.\n\nMentions of \"cryptocurrency\" in parliamentary chambers and committees peaked at 279 over 2022 but have since dropped to just 94 in 2023 to date. Most of the references have been made by Liberals, looking to call attention to Poilievre's previous advocacy. Just recently, the Liberals launched an attack ad on Poilievre, leaning on his Bitcoin stance.\n\nA private member's bill attempting to encourage growth in the sector, sponsored by Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner, was voted down earlier this year.\n\nA parliamentary committee studying the issue delivered a report on the issue in June, arguing crypto had the potential to generate \"significant long-term economic and job creation opportunities in Canada.\"\n\nBut a government response to the study did not commit to following through on its recommendations and instead referred more broadly to existing programs and regulations.\n\nMariam Humayun, an assistant professor at the University of Ottawa who researches cryptocurrency, said that despite the waning political and media interest, those in the industry continue to develop new technologies and products.\n\n\"They've been building, despite nobody paying attention to them and media not caring about it or politicians not caring about it,\" Humayun said.\n\nIn fact, Humayun said, a certain skepticism has emerged in the cryptocurrency community regarding politicians.\n\n\"I think a lot of people in the Bitcoin space actually kind of are very wary of politicians, because they sort of see them as fair-weather friends,\" she said. \"They will embrace these things when everything is great, but then they don't really talk about it when things are down, right?\"\n\nA question of regulation\n\nWithout clear direction from governments, responsibility for handling emerging regulatory issues in cryptocurrency has fallen to independent regulators, said Matthew Burgoyne, who co-chairs a specialized digital asset team at the Osler law firm.\n\nCanada's umbrella regulator, the Canadian Securities Administrators, has published several of what are called \"staff notices\" on the technology.\n\n\"They're not law. They don't have the the the force of law,\" Burgoyne said. \"But what's happened is most cryptocurrency companies in Canada, primarily trading platforms, have followed staff's suggestions.\" That creates a situation where there's \"de facto\" law, he said.\n\n\"I think in this environment it's just important for the federal government to take a stand and I think that would alleviate some confusion,\" Burgoyne said.\n\nConservative candidates take aim at Pierre Poilievre for his stance on bitcoin Duration 5:21 Conservative leadership candidates Jean Charest and Leslyn Lewis accused Pierre Poilievre of encouraging Canadians to invest in the digital currency.\n\nThe last few years also saw some developments on new digital currency technology. The Bank of Canada announced it would review the possibility of a digital Canadian currency, for example.\n\n\"My view from the Bank is that they don't see cryptocurrencies as big enough yet. They're keeping an eye on it, they're aware of it, but they don't see it as a threat to the Canadian dollar,\" said Clark.\n\nClark said that even though the crypto industry is still developing, still deploying new technologies, it suffers from limited mainstream appeal. Most of the activity in the industry was in the financial services sector, he said, with little application to everyday life.\n\n\"I think if it doesn't break out of tools for blockchain people trading blockchain things, ultimately it's not going to succeed,\" he said."

        "content": "Jack Dorsey-led Block, a Bitcoin-focused fintech company, published its third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 2, revealing a profitable quarter and surpassing analyst expectations.\n\nThe firm had $5.62 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2023, boosted by solid revenue growth in Cash App and Square, with $44 million in profit on its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings thanks to a price surge in recent months.\n\nIn a shareholder letter, Dorsey shed light on the company\u2019s focus and future plans, especially with Square, along with the key financial metrics from the third quarter. Dorsey said the company had authorized the repurchase of $1 billion in shares to offset a portion of dilution from share-based compensation.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, Block generated a gross profit of $1.90 billion, up 21% year-over-year. On the other hand, the mobile payment service Cash App generated a gross profit of $984 million, up 27% year-over-year, and Square generated a gross profit of $899 million, up 15%.\n\nBlock\u2019 Q3 profits. Source: Block\n\nBitcoin revenue accounted for approximately 43% of the $5.6 billion in revenue for Block. The fintech firms\u2019 growth in the third quarter was also aided by strong consumer demand and positive spending.\n\nRelated: Jack Dorsey tips pro-crypto candidate Robert Kennedy to win presidency\n\nBlock\u2019s Bitcoin gross profit stood at $45 million, up by 22% year-over-year, with the firm selling $2.42 billion worth of BTC to customers via Cash App. The company\u2019s Bitcoin gross profit stood at 2% of Bitcoin revenue. The firm claimed that the rise in BTC revenue was fueled by an increase in the average market price of Bitcoin and the quantity of Bitcoin sold to customers.\n\nBlock stated it has not seen any impairment loss on its Bitcoin holding since the previous quarter. Block\u2019s investment in Bitcoin had a carrying value of $102 million as of Sept. 30, 2023, but its fair value, determined by observable market prices, was $216 million, or $114 million more than its carrying value.\n\nMagazine: Crypto regulation \u2014 Does SEC Chair Gary Gensler have the final say?"

        "title": "Bitcoin a Decade Long Hodl: Cathie Wood's Reasons for Backing BTC Over Everything - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nCathie Wood believes Bitcoin is the best hedge against the risk of deflation over the next ten years.\n\nArk Investment leader expects a period of falling prices driven by technological advancements.\n\nShe considers Bitcoin as a strong hedge against both inflation and deflation, referring to it as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d\n\nIn the last ten years, Bitcoin has surged into the limelight as the leading cryptocurrency. During this journey, various narratives have emerged to support the notion of investing in Bitcoin.\n\nOne such narrative compares it to \u201cdigital gold\u201d because, akin to gold, it can function as a means of preserving value and serve as a safeguard against inflation.\n\nCathie Wood Favors Bitcoin as \u201cDigital Gold\u201d Hedge\n\nTo hedge against the risk of deflation in the upcoming ten years, Cathie Wood says she would categorically bet on Bitcoin rather than gold or cash.\n\nEven as markets have focused on a new era of heightened inflation risks, the head of ARK Investment Management reiterated her view that she expects an era of falling prices, supported by new technologies like robotics, electric vehicles, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and genomic sequencing. She has held this opinion since 2021.\n\nSo, why is US employment still so strong, supporting the government\u2019s point of view? In our view, labor hoarding after two years of vacancies is a reason on the demand side, while loss of purchasing power \u2013 especially food and energy \u2013 is a reason on the supply side, BUT\u2026 \u2014 Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) October 26, 2023\n\nWhen asked which of the three asset classes she would pick to hold for ten years, Wood responded , \u201cBitcoin, hands down.\u201d Due to its little involvement from institutions and lack of counterparty risk, bitcoin is a hedge against both inflation and deflation. \u201cDigital gold,\u201d as she put it.\n\nWood has been one of the more upbeat commentators on cryptocurrencies. She believies that they will gain from the broader advancements and expansion of new technology. She had before forecast that within the next ten years, the price of Bitcoin would surpass $1 million . It is currently $35,000, or around half of its peak in 2021.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised when #Bitcoin goes to $1 million post spot ETF approval. Market cap doesn\u2019t increase linearly ($1 BTC buy doesn\u2019t make market cap go up $1), there\u2019s a multiplier effect. \u2014 Samson Mow (@Excellion) November 1, 2023\n\nSEC Eyes Bitcoin ETFs And Wood May Benefit\n\nNevertheless, Bitcoin\u2019s value has more than doubled this year after plunging 64% in 2022 as a result of market participants praising it as a possible inflation hedge, even though it did not function as one amid the largest consumer price spike since the early 1980s.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission may soon authorise exchange-traded funds that invest directly in the coin, according to recent bets, which have caused the token to surge.\n\nWood is one of the people most likely to gain from ETF approvals. Her company has invested in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and submitted an application for a Bitcoin ETF with 21Shares. GBTC was purchased by Wood\u2019s $1.2 billion ARK Next Generation Internet ETF in November of last year, at a roughly 40% discount.\n\nThe trust, which is the fund\u2019s largest position, has returned over 224% so far this year as of Wednesday. In comparison, the rise in Bitcoin is about 114%. Last month, ARK sold a portion of its GBTC assets.\n\nWood stated on the programme that she anticipates a convergence between Bitcoin and AI. This is \u201cgoing to enable a division of labour and microtasks globally in a way we can\u2019t even imagine now.\u201d\n\n\u2026if we are right that prices are about to unravel and crush margins, then companies will be forced not only to lay off excess labor but also to harness AI and other automation to salvage margins. Innovation solves problems and gains traction during tough times! \u2014 Cathie Wood (@CathieDWood) October 26, 2023\n\nPeter Schiff Warns of Bitcoin\u2019s Peak Amid SEC Buzz\n\nPeter Schiff, a prominent advocate for gold investments, recently shared his views on the current state of Bitcoin trading and the potential consequences of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighting a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).\n\nSchiff cautioned that any discussions regarding ETF approval could potentially signify the pinnacle of the Bitcoin uptrend. He stated :\n\n\u201cBitcoin is currently priced at $35K, with speculators placing their bets on the SEC\u2019s approval of GBTC transforming into an ETF. If such talks occur, it is likely to mark the peak of the rally, unless Bitcoin experiences a decline before approval. The magnitude of the decline will be less significant if the ETF conversion is once again denied.\u201d\n\nSchiff warned Bitcoin investors in another X post about the possible dangers and traps that could arise, especially in light of the recent excitement surrounding the creation of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSpeculators are buying #Bitcoin now because they think other speculators are waiting to buy a #BitcoinETF . They will soon discover that there are far more speculators waiting to sell then waiting to buy! \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 23, 2023\n\nComplementary or Substitutive?\n\nThe question of whether Bitcoin will eventually replace gold as the ultimate store of value may not be entirely fitting, as there\u2019s a likelihood that both can and will coexist as complementary assets. Just as it\u2019s customary in various investment sectors, the Bitcoin versus gold choice will ultimately depend on the individual investor\u2019s risk profile.\n\nWhen it comes to constructing a well-balanced portfolio, diversification is key. It involves holding a variety of assets that may not necessarily exhibit correlated movements.\n\nBitcoin, akin to gold, has emerged as an alternative investment choice for certain investors, offering a spectrum of potential applications. Its viability as an investment hinges on employing a suitable strategy.\n\nThe better choice between the two depends on factors such as risk tolerance, investing approach, available capital, and capacity to withstand potential losses. Bitcoin\u2019s significantly higher volatility in comparison to gold renders it a riskier investment option."

        "content": "Paul Kemp is the director of Searching for Satoshi: The Mysterious Disappearance of the Bitcoin Creator.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIf that name is unfamiliar to you, here's what you need to know: it's not a real name, but a pseudonym for the person who invented Bitcoin in 2009. And in 2011, that person disappeared without a trace, leaving behind a personal stash of an estimated 1 million Bitcoins (valued at about $73 billion US at its peak) that hasn't been touched since.\n\nSearching for Satoshi: The Mysterious Disappearance of the Bitcoin Creator explores the facts, the fictions and the conspiracies surrounding one the world's greatest modern mysteries.\n\n'No interference, no regulation and no surveillance'\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin, a digital cryptocurrency built on blockchain technology. It was a completely new form of virtual money untethered to any government or financial institution.\n\nBitcoin was a breakthrough because it operates entirely peer-to-peer, with no need for banks, governments or intermediaries like PayPal or Visa to make monetary transactions. There is no interference, no regulation and no surveillance. Bitcoin is money that transfers directly, quite literally, from one wallet to another.\n\nMany Bitcoin enthusiasts suggest it could be the most profound financial disruptor of all time by dismantling our dependency on financial institutions.\n\nBut just over two years after releasing Bitcoin to the world, Nakamoto disappeared.\n\nWhy do we care who Satoshi Nakamoto really is?\n\nNakamoto's invention is unquestionably significant. At first considered a rogue and volatile digital commodity, Bitcoin has gained such value that it can no longer be ignored by the financial establishment.\n\nCountries like Canada, the U.S., China, Japan, India and the U.K. are struggling with how to categorize and regulate Bitcoin, while some countries like El Salvador have already made it legal tender.\n\nBitcoin is already considered \"digital gold\" by many, and it could eventually become the world's most trusted currency, with many using it as a reserve currency. Only time will tell.\n\nBut there's more to people's fascination with Nakamoto than the magnitude of his invention.\n\nWhen Nakamoto accumulated his estimated 1 million Bitcoins, nobody else was really mining for them. At peak market rate, those Bitcoins would have been worth an estimated $73 billion US, placing him among the top 15 wealthiest people on the planet.\n\nYet despite this treasury of wealth, not a single one of Nakamoto's original Bitcoins has ever moved or traded hands. Were they lost? Stolen? Or could it be that his privacy is more valuable than risking being identified when cashing out big? For many, this seemingly saint-like preservation of anonymity over financial gain gives the Bitcoin story a somewhat mystical feeling.\n\nNakamoto has not been heard from since May of 2011, and as his stockpile of untouched Bitcoins skyrockets in value, his myth also grows exponentially.\n\nBrand Bitcoin\n\nNakamoto's disappearance and unknown identity is living testament to \"brand Bitcoin\" \u2014 central to its allure.\n\nIf we knew the truth behind why he disappeared \u2014 whether he is even still alive, or died of illness, suicide or murder \u2014 we could close off all narratives that could be projected onto him.\n\nInstead, Satoshi Nakamoto has become a symbol. A godhead. He can be of any nationality or identity, and the vessel for the liberation, equity, revolution, anarchy, prosperity, redemption, independence, freedom, divinity or salvation that we seek.\n\nYet many still want to know: Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\nEven if you're not convinced of who Nakamoto is after watching this film, one thing is certain: you will never forget his name."

        "title": "A Deep Dive Into Bitcoin Forks And Alternatives For 2023 - Nasdaq",
        "content": "The world of cryptocurrency has witnessed significant growth and innovation in recent years. Bitcoin, the pioneering digital asset, has led the way in revolutionizing financial market concepts. As the value of Bitcoin continues to rise, investors are keeping a close eye on its potential for future growth. However, with the emergence of Bitcoin forks and alternative cryptocurrencies, there are now additional opportunities for investors to explore. In this article, we will delve deep into the world of Bitcoin forks and alternatives, analyzing their features, benefits, and potential for success in 2023.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Forks\n\nBitcoin forks are created when developers make changes to the original Bitcoin code, resulting in the creation of a new cryptocurrency. These forks can be categorized into two types: hard forks and soft forks. Hard forks involve significant changes to the protocol, resulting in the creation of a new blockchain. Soft forks, on the other hand, involve minor changes that are backward compatible with the original blockchain.\n\nPopular Bitcoin Forks Bitcoin XT\n\nOne of the earliest Bitcoin forks was Bitcoin XT, created in 2014. Bitcoin XT aimed to increase the number of transactions per second by increasing the block size. However, the project faced challenges and eventually lost momentum.\n\nBitcoin Classic\n\nFollowing the failure of Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic emerged in 2016. The developers of Bitcoin Classic focused on increasing the block size to improve scalability. While the project initially gained support, it has since seen a decline in popularity.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited\n\nBitcoin Unlimited, launched in 2016, offered an alternative approach to scaling Bitcoin. The project allowed miners to determine the block size, providing more flexibility in the network. However, Bitcoin Unlimited has not gained significant traction and remains a lesser-known fork.\n\nBitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash, created in 2017, is one of the most well-known Bitcoin forks. It aimed to address the scalability issues of Bitcoin by increasing the block size to 8MB. Bitcoin Cash has gained a substantial following and has become a popular alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Gold\n\nBitcoin Gold, launched in 2017, focused on making mining more accessible to individual miners. The project aimed to bring back the use of GPUs instead of specialized mining hardware. While Bitcoin Gold has not achieved the same level of success as Bitcoin Cash, it remains an interesting alternative in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe Rise of Bitcoin Alternatives\n\nWhile Bitcoin forks have gained attention, there are also numerous alternative cryptocurrencies that offer unique features and benefits. These alternatives seek to address various issues faced by Bitcoin, such as scalability, transaction speed, and decentralization.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is another leading digital currency that has made significant advancements in the blockchain space. Ethereum offers a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, expanding on the initial Bitcoin concept and giving additional use to its cryptocurrency. The smart contract feature allows the blockchain to be a bed for developers to flourish with their own token-based products.\n\nBitcoin Spark\n\nBitcoin Spark builds on both Bitcoin and Ethereum as an alternative that utilizes a unique Proof-of-Process (PoP) mechanism. This mechanism combines Proof-of-Work (PoW), originally introduced by Bitcoin, and Proof-of-Stake (PoS), to which Ethereum has recently changed to improve mining decentralization and transaction speed. Bitcoin Spark allows anyone with a smartphone to participate in the mining process, democratizing the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThe Potential of Bitcoin Forks and Alternatives\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to rise in value, many investors are looking for alternative investment opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin forks and alternatives offer unique features and benefits that may appeal to different investors. The Bitcoin Spark ICO is the next step on this journey to profitable Bitcoin alternatives, with many investors already grabbing large allocations.\n\nPredicting the future of Bitcoin forks and alternatives is challenging due to the volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market. However, with the increasing interest from institutional investors and the potential for market-wide adoption, there is a possibility of significant growth and development in this space. Investors should conduct thorough research and analysis before making any investment decisions.\n\nThere is no doubt that making the next leap in technology will bring about huge interest, and what Bitcoin Spark brings to the table with its Proof-Of-Process technology that allows revenue to be generated on top of the blockchain will certainly pull many in the industry towards it.\n\nIf Bitcoin Spark works in the same way many of the previous Bitcoin alternatives have, it may be interesting to see how it unfolds.\n\nLearn more about Bitcoin Spark here:\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nThis post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

Discover SCENE\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is prepared to move quickly if a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved soon, Coinbase COO Emilie Choi said during an earnings call Thursday with investors and analysts.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to hit the ground running,\u201d Choi said. \u201cThey should add credibility to the market, and we should see increased liquidity and market stability, as we've seen with other asset classes, such as a gold ETF.\u201d\n\nCrypto moguls, such as the Winklevoss twins, have pursued ETF-like products that let investors gain Bitcoin exposure in a brokerage account for more than a decade. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has hesitated to approve one thus far.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, the hype has hit new levels this year, in light of Grayscale\u2019s courtroom victory and several financial giants, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, that have thrown their weight into the mix of ETF hopefuls. JP Morgan analysts think it\u2019s \u201cmost likely\u201d that a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved within the next three months.\n\nWhile influential figures in the digital assets realm, such as MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, have spoken at length about a spot Bitcoin ETF\u2019s potential to send prices soaring, Choi\u2019s remarks underscore stability.\n\nAs a spot Bitcoin ETF makes it easier for institutional investors to trade Bitcoin\u2014without needing to worry about self-custody\u2014greater stability for an asset class that\u2019s known to be volatile should be expected, 3iQ Head of Research Mark Connors told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cInstitutions have a different cadence of investment, where they rebalance across multi-asset portfolios,\u201d he said. \u201cInstitutions tend to dampen the spikes and support the troughs\u2014that is institutional, multi-asset investment 101.\u201d\n\nIn simple terms, Connors said that a spot Bitcoin ETF would enable institutions to easily sell into any demand that arises from an outsized gain. Conversely, he said institutions would rebalance their portfolios if Bitcoin sees an outsized loss.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPointing to the impact that SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) had on the asset when the gold-based ETF made its Wall Street debut in 2004, Connors said that the liquidity associated with the institutional adoption of an asset class breeds stable markets.\n\nOn its earnings call with analysts on Thursday, Choi spoke about Coinbase\u2019s unique position as a slated custodian for several spot Bitcoin ETFs\u2014and how the product would yield the exchange an additional source of revenue.\n\n\u201cCoinbase is very proud to have been selected to partner with the majority of the potential issuers, who are among the world's most trusted financial institutions,\u201d she said. \u201cThe primary way that we will monetize ETFs directly in the near term is through custody fees.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, a spot Bitcoin ETF\u2019s potential to broaden access among retail investors and expand crypto ownership in the U.S. was noted by the Coinbase COO.\n\n\u201cOne stat that I find really powerful is that 52 million Americans own crypto today despite the current regulatory overhang,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, imagine what will happen once ETFs are introduced and widely available.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBlock, the fintech firm led by the former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, saw its share price jump by more than 20% to over $52 in after-hours trading on Thursday, after reporting better-than-expected Q3 earnings.\n\nThe company, formerly known as Square, posted a net revenue of $5.62 billion, up 24% year-over-year (YoY), and an adjusted EBITDA\u2013earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\u2013of $477 million, up 32% over the same period of time.\n\nThe strong performance was largely driven by a 37.5% yearly growth in Bitcoin revenue through Block\u2019s key product, Cash App, which accounted for more than half of Block\u2019s total net revenue in Q3, reaching $2.42 billion, up from $1.76 billion the previous year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCash App, which last month celebrated its 10th anniversary since its launch, is a mobile payment service that allows users to send and receive fiat money, buy and sell Bitcoin, and invest in stocks.\n\n\u201cThe year-over-year increase in Bitcoin revenue and gross profit was driven by an increase in both the average market price of Bitcoin and the quantity of Bitcoin sold to customers,\u201d Block said in its Q3 earning report.\n\nOverall, Cash App generated $3.58 billion of revenue and $984 million of gross profit, up 34% and 27% year over year, respectively. Excluding Bitcoin revenue, Cash App revenue was $1.16 billion, up 26% year over year.\n\nThe company\u2019s other payment platform, Square, reported revenues of $1.98 billion, up 8% over the year. Square is a point-of-sale system that enables merchants to accept card payments and manage their businesses.\n\nBlock\u2019s Bitcoin gross profit saw a 22% increase, reaching $45 million compared to $36 million the previous year, per the report\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNo impairment loss on Block\u2019s Bitcoin holdings\n\nDespite the earnings beat, accounting rules created a discrepancy of $114 million between the market and book values of Block\u2019s Bitcoin holdings, valued at $216 million.\n\nHowever, no impairment loss was recorded in Q3 2023, as the company follows the lower of cost or market method, which means that it only recognizes losses when the market value falls below the cost basis, but not gains when the market value rises above the cost basis.\n\nBlock revised its full-year guidance for 2023, raising its adjusted EBITDA from $1.5 billion to between $1.66 and $1.68 billion and its operating income from $25 million to between $205 and $225 million.\n\nThe company also provided a 2024 adjusted operating income guidance of $875 million and projected a gross profit for 2023 between $7.44 and $7.46 billion.\n\nIn his letter to shareholders, Dorsey said that \u201cwe\u2019ve been quiet lately because we\u2019ve been focused,\u201d adding that Block aims to \u201cbuild simple, fair, and accessible financial services for everyone\u201d and to \u201cempower people with economic freedom.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dorsey, there have been \u201ca number of things\u201d holding the company back, and when it comes to future growth, the firm is looking to focus more on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe believe artificial intelligence can be a powerful assistant to help sellers further grow their businesses as it can enable greater creativity, efficiency, and productivity,\u201d said the report."

        "title": "CME Bitcoin futures hit record high, but uncertainty looms above $36K - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin futures open interest at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) hit an all-time high of $3.65 billion on Nov. 1. This metric considers the value of every contract in play for the remaining calendar months, where buyers (longs) and sellers (shorts) are continually matched.\n\nBullish momentum on CME Bitcoin futures, but cautious BTC options markets\n\nThe number of active large holders surged to a record 122 during the week of Oct. 31, signaling a growing institutional interest in Bitcoin (BTC). Notably, the Bitcoin CME futures premium reached its highest level in over two years.\n\nIn neutral markets, the annualized premium typically falls within the 5%\u201310% range. However, the latest 15% premium for CME Bitcoin futures stands out, indicating a strong demand for long positions. This also raises concerns, as some may be relying on the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nContradicting the bullish sentiment from CME futures, evidence from Bitcoin options markets reveals a growing demand for protective put options. For instance, the put-to-call open interest ratio at the Deribit exchange reached its highest levels in over six months.\n\nDeribit Bitcoin options put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe current 1.0 level signifies a balanced open interest between call (buy) and put (sell) options. However, this indicator requires further analysis, as investors could have sold the call option, gaining positive exposure to Bitcoin above a specific price.\n\nRegardless of demand in the derivatives market, Bitcoin\u2019s price ultimately relies on spot exchange flows. For instance, the rejection at $36,000 on Nov. 2 led to a 5% correction, bringing the price down to $34,130. Interestingly, the Bitfinex exchange experienced daily net BTC inflows of $300 million during this movement.\n\nThe fourth biggest inflow of #Bitcoin to @bitfinex yesterday, was roughly $300M; as soon as the inflow started, #Bitcoin started to trend down.\n\n\n\nExtremely bullish, significant sell pressure, and #Bitcoin is still above $34,000https://t.co/xVpZcXGAZW pic.twitter.com/I72N686HfH \u2014 James V. Straten (@jimmyvs24) November 3, 2023\n\nAs analyst James Straten highlighted, the whale deposit coincided with the fading momentum of Bitcoin, suggesting a potential connection between these movements. However, the downturn did not breach the $34,000 support, indicating real buyers at that level.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s latest correction occurred while the Russell 2000 Index futures, measuring mid-cap companies in the United States, gained 2.5% and reached a two-week high. This suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s movement was unrelated to the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to maintain interest rates at 5.25%.\n\nAdditionally, the price of gold remained stable at around $1,985 between Nov. 1 and Nov. 3, demonstrating that the world's largest store of value was not affected by the monetary policy announcement. The question remains: how much selling pressure do Bitcoin sellers at $36,000 still hold?\n\nReduced Bitcoin availability on exchanges can be deceiving\n\nAs demonstrated by the $300 million daily net inflow to Bitfinex, merely assessing current deposits at exchanges does not provide a clear picture of short-term sale availability. A lower number of deposited coins may reflect lower investor confidence in exchanges.\n\nApart from legal challenges against the Coinbase and Binance exchanges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for unlicensed brokerage operations, the FTX-Alameda Research debacle has stirred more concerns among investors. Recently, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis called on the Justice Department to take \u201cswift action\u201d against Binance and Tether for their alleged involvement in facilitating funds for terrorist organizations.\n\nRelated: SEC seeks summary judgment in Do Kwon and Terraform Labs case\n\nLastly, the cryptocurrency market has been impacted by increased returns from traditional fiat fixed-income operations, while the once lucrative cryptocurrency yields vanished following the Luna-TerraUSD collapse in May 2022. This movement has had lasting effects on the lending sector, leading to the collapse of several intermediaries, including BlockFi, Voyager and Celsius.\n\nAt the moment, there is undeniable growing institutional demand for Bitcoin derivatives, according to CME futures data. However, this may not be directly related to lower spot availability, making it difficult to predict the supply between $36,000 and $40,000 \u2014 a level untested since April 2022.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s fortnight long rally cooled off this week, but several of the biggest altcoins continued posting double digit percentage gains, including Ripple\u2019s XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA).\n\nEntering the weekend, Bitcoin (BTC) grew by 2.7% over the last seven days to hit its current price of $34,802. Much of its price appreciation over the last two weeks was down to hype that an exchange-traded fund (ETF) would soon be approved stateside.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSuffice to say, that hasn\u2019t happened yet\u2014but one analyst at investment research firm Bernstein said in a note to clients on Tuesday that it could happen in the first quarter of 2024 and may even drive Bitcoin\u2019s price to $150k by 2025.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s biggest competitor, Ethereum (ETH), matched the market leader\u2019s pace and grew 2% this week to change hands at $1,809 as of Friday.\n\nSolana (SOL) undoubtedly posted the biggest gains, growing 22.9% over the week to trade at $39.58. At its peak last week, the coin was 80% higher than it was at the start of the month. This is down to a steadily growing developer community that sees Solana (SOL) as a real contender to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSolana\u2019s rally briefly dipped 5% on Friday amidst sizable SOL transfers from wallets linked to FTX, following a court-approved liquidation of $3.4 billion of the collapsed exchange\u2019s digital assets in September, including $1.16 billion in SOL.\n\nThe coins and tokens in the top thirty by market cap that posted the most notable rallies this week include XRP, which rose 11.4% to $0.611593, Cardano (ADA) grew 11.2% to $0.320599, Toncoin (TON) rallied 9.2% to $2.25, Polkadot (DOT) surged 1.7% to $12, Uniswap (UNI) rallied 14% to $4.65, Stellar\u2019s XLM grew 9.6% to $0.123115, and Cosmos Hub (ATOM) grew 10% to $7.75.\n\nIn the news\n\nOn Tuesday, USDC issuer Circle said that it\u2019s closing down legacy accounts, meaning that retail users can no longer mint the stablecoin from the company itself\u2014they'll need to buy tokens from exchanges or brokerages.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPayPal on Wednesday became a registered crypto service provider with the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This means the online payments giant can begin marketing its digital asset services to UK clientele.\n\nCrypto exchange Coinbase reported a third-quarter loss of $2.2 million on Thursday although it still outdid analysts\u2019 predictions. Jack Dorsey\u2019s crypto-integrated payments company Block also reported better-than-expected Q3 earnings, netting total revenue of $5.62 billion thanks largely to its Bitcoin-related business.\n\nFinally, SEC Chief and infamous crypto skeptic Gry Gensler shared a birthday message for Bitcoin on Halloween.\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is a prominent post-trade settlement house, managing trillion dollars in securities transactions worldwide each day.\n\nThe Invesco Galaxy\u2019s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been listed on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation\u2019s (DTCC) website under the ticker name BTCO. With this listing, Invesco Galaxy\u2019s ETF has joined BlackRock on the DTCC site.The date when the ticker was added to the DTCC list remains unclear. The web archiver Wayback Machine\u2019s records show no listing under the ticker BTCO on Oct 25, indicating it must have been added after that date.According to a DTCC spokesperson, it is standard practice for the DTCC to add securities to the National Securities Clearing Corporations\u2019 (NSCC) security eligibility file \u201cin preparation for the launch of a new ETF to the market.\u201d The NSCC is a clearing corporation that provides centralised clearing and settlement services to the financial industry.

Some rejected applications include ETFs of asset management firms like Grayscale, BlackRock, Bitwise, and Valkyrie.Although the ETF is still pending approval from the SEC, the fact that the Invesco Galaxy spot Bitcoin ETF has been added to the DTCC site indicates that the ETF is meeting the DTCC\u2019s technical and operational standards.If the Bitcoin ETF is approved by the SEC, it would be a significant development for the Bitcoin industry. It would provide investors with a new and convenient way to invest in Bitcoin and lead to increased institutional investment in Bitcoin."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market was in the red after the conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of crypto exchange FTX. On Friday, Bitcoin fell over 3 per cent and was trading around $34,300, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum was down 2.2 per cent and was trading below $1,800.\n\nIn the last week, both the tokens have made minor gains. Bitcoin was up 0.59 per cent and Ethereum rose 0.28 per cent. The markets had begun the market on a high amid a rate hike pause by the US Federal Reserve.\n\n\"The big development from the courtroom was the FTX trial's verdict, where founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all seven charges of criminal fraud. Crypto markets did react negatively to the news, resulting in a divergence from other risky assets like equities, which continued to scale amidst the rate hike pause, while crypto prices corrected,\" said Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\nAfter the month-long trial, US jurors rejected Bankman-Fried's claim during testimony in Manhattan federal court that he never committed fraud or meant to cheat customers before FTX, once the world's second-largest crypto exchange, collapsed into bankruptcy a year ago.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that US Attorney Damian Williams said Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history, \"a multibillion-dollar scheme designed to make him the king of crypto\".\n\n\"But here's the thing: The cryptocurrency industry might be new. The players like Sam Bankman-Fried might be new. This kind of fraud, this kind of corruption, is as old as time and we have no patience for it,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the research team of crypto exchange CoinDCX, Bitcoin's key support levels include the $34,400 inclined trendline support and approximately $33,400, while resistance levels are situated at $35,170 and $36,000.\n\n\"Bitcoin's next move hinges on whether it can break through the $35,000 threshold to resume its upward trajectory or if it might find support around $34,300,\" added Edul Patel, chief executive officer of Mudrex. \"The market sentiment is presently neutral as investors await the release of the US non-farm payroll report later today.\""
