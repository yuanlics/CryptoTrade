        "content": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nNew York CNN \u2014\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies were on a tear at the end of last year, driven higher by anticipation that US regulators would approve bitcoin exchange-traded funds, broadening the pool of potential investors.\n\nOnce those funds received the go-ahead, bitcoin fell. What gives?\n\nBitcoin topped $47,000 early this month for the first time since April 2022, as investors anticipated that the US Securities and Exchange Commission would approve the first ever exchange-traded funds tracking the spot price of bitcoin.\n\nBut the cryptocurrency declined after the favorable SEC decision duly came on January 10. And bitcoin edged below $40,000 earlier this week for the first time since December.\n\nThe price of the cryptocurrency was trading at roughly $39,519 a coin as of 4 pm ET on Wednesday.\n\nSo, why is the price of bitcoin falling, even after investors got what they wanted? Part of the reason is likely a \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d mentality, according to Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo. That\u2019s the idea that the price of an asset often rises in anticipation of an announcement and then falls as investors take profits once the news actually comes out.\n\nInterestingly, bitcoin ETF activity actually shows net buying.\n\nInvestors have pulled about $4.4 billion from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust since it was converted to an ETF on January 11, according to Coinshares data through Wednesday. Greyscale\u2019s fund is the largest bitcoin ETF, holding roughly $20 billion in assets.\n\nBut those flows have been offset by about $5.3 billion poured into nine other spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nETFs hold just a small portion of the bitcoin that\u2019s traded, says Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. That means \u201cthe call is coming from inside the house. Someone who pre-owned the crypto is doing the selling,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin has made its way higher over the last year since plummeting to below $17,000 in late 2022, after cryptocurrency exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy and set off a firestorm in crypto trading. Still, it remains well below its record high of roughly $69,000 reached in November 2021.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to this kind of volatility in the space. What matters now is what\u2019s coming next that could generate excitement around cryptos and deliver further gains,\u201d wrote Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, in a note on Tuesday.\n\nYour 401(k), gas prices and homes: 3 surprising reasons to be happy\n\nAmericans have been fed up with an economy that many feel isn\u2019t working for them, and the 2024 election may turn out to be a referendum on that gloomy sentiment. But the winds may be changing a bit: 401(k) plans are on fire. Consumer sentiment is surging. Gas prices have fallen. The country\u2019s economic vibes are finally vibing again, according to an analysis by my colleague Bryan Mena.\n\nThe years-long economic funk was largely driven by the unforgiving pain of high inflation. A tough housing market and exorbitant child care costs continue to bedevil budgets, but the inflation pendulum is finally swinging in the other direction.\n\nInflation is down substantially from its four-decade peak in the summer of 2022. A powerful US stock rally is now back on track, mortgage rates have eased a bit in recent weeks and the job market remains in great shape, with unemployment near historic lows.\n\nNone of this guarantees the good times will continue, of course. Conflicts abroad could push up prices for oil and other consumer goods, for example.\n\nBut consumer surveys have begun to capture a shifting, more upbeat sentiment among Americans. Here are three reasons to be happy about the current state of the US economy. (At least for now.)\n\nRead more here.\n\nIt\u2019s still too hard to be a working parent in America, Janet Yellen says\n\nIn a major speech set to be delivered Thursday in Chicago, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to detail her vision for helping middle-class families overcome affordability challenges, according to excerpts shared first with CNN.\n\n\u201cOur economic agenda is far from finished. There\u2019s much more the President and I would like to do to support the middle class,\u201d Yellen plans to say during the speech at the Economic Club of Chicago.\n\nTreasury officials have billed the speech as one of the most significant Yellen plans to deliver this year and an effort to set the tone for her domestic agenda during 2024, reports my colleague Matt Egan.\n\nYellen plans to balance the Biden administration taking credit for the economic recovery from Covid-19 with acknowledging that many Americans are frustrated with how expensive it is to buy a house, raise children and save money for college.\n\n\u201cIt is still too hard to be a working parent. We need to get American families access to affordable child care and other support for their children,\u201d Yellen is set to say, according to the excerpts.\n\nRead more here."

        "title": "Bitcoin Halving 2024: What to Expect? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBTC halving will occur when the number of blocks reaches 840,000 in April 2024. Then, the reward per block will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.\n\nUsually, the bitcoin price rises for about six months before halving and is rather stable during the event. The primary growth occurs in the year following the halving.\n\nIf Bitcoin mirrors its performance from the previous two periods, its price could reach the $220k mark in 2025.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) halving will occur in April 2024, resulting in a 50% reduction in bitcoin mining speed. Historically, this event catalyses value growth and, therefore, attracts the attention of investors. To determine whether Bitcoin halving will push BTC to new heights, let\u2019s explore and analyse the dynamics together\n\nBitcoin, Mining, Halving \u2014 What You Need To Know\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that operates on a decentralised computer network. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown group of individuals, or, according to some sources, a person named Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin\u2019s defining feature lies in its capped supply of 21 million coins acquired through the mining process. Mining uses computer power to solve complex mathematical puzzles and verify transactions on the Bitcoin network.\n\nNewly mined bitcoins are given to miners as a reward for their labour. However, the number of bitcoins miners receive for each block (set of transactions) varies. Every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, miners\u2019 rewards are cut in half. This phenomenon is referred to as \u2018BTC halving\u2019 or \u2018halving\u2019.\n\nThe purpose of Bitcoin halving is to maintain the currency\u2019s scarcity and value while managing the inflation rate. The assumption is that as the number of new bitcoins issued decreases, demand for them will increase, and prices will rise accordingly. This is based on the economic concept of supply and demand. However, a halving event doubles the cost and complexity of mining, reducing miners\u2019 profitability. This could lead to some miners leaving the market, reducing the hash rate\u2014the overall computing power of the network\u2014and potentially impacting its security.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving will occur when the number of blocks reaches 840,000 in April 2024. The reward per block will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC at that time. This will be the fourth halving of the leading cryptocurrency in history. The previous three halvings occurred in 2012, 2016, and 2020.\n\nIs It Possible To Make Money From BTC Halving?\n\nAssuming constant demand, halving the supply is expected to double the asset\u2019s value. Historical data indicates that investing in Bitcoin prior to a halving event has been a profitable strategy.\n\n\u2018Usually, bitcoin starts to rise about six months before the halving, and it doesn\u2019t change much during the halving period,\u2019 said Kar Yong Ang, the Octa financial market analyst. \u2018On average, in the past, the upper peak of the exchange rate can be observed more than a year after halving,\u2019 he added.\n\nExamining the price dynamics in the year preceding and following the halving events over the last three cycles reveals significant growth for Bitcoin. During these two-year spans, Bitcoin experienced remarkable increases: approximately 30,000% in 2012, 786% in 2016, and 712% in 2020. If Bitcoin continues to show the same performance this time, its price could reach the $220k mark in 2025.\n\nFor traders, it is important to focus on a shorter timeframe. Notably, 150 days after the first halving, the price of BTC surged by 928%, followed by a 16.6% increase after the second halving and a subsequent 25.8% rise after the third.\n\nHowever, as factors such as significant hacks or bankruptcies of crypto companies, stock market conditions, whale manipulation, or regulatory changes reduce the coin issuance, future halving events may be less potent.\n\nAbout Octa\n\n\n\nOcta is an international broker that has been providing online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers commission-free access to financial markets and various services already utilised by clients from 180 countries with more than 42 million trading accounts.

        "content": "With each step Bitcoin takes toward more widespread acceptance, it loses some of what made it appealing in the first place.\n\nTwo big things have happened in the crypto world this month: a public validation and a semi-private snub. Both of them bode poorly for its future.\n\nThe official validation came in the form of the SEC approval of a Bitcoin ETF, which will make it easier for speculators to invest in Bitcoin. The slight came at this year\u2019s World Economic Forum, which I attended, and where Bitcoin \u2014 or any cryptocurrency, really \u2014 was clearly on the outs. Last year crypto was everywhere in Davos. This year, the star of the show was AI. Crypto, like me, didn\u2019t even know about all the really good parties, much less get an invitation.\n\nThese may seem like contradictory developments: On the one hand, a Bitcoin ETF legitimizes crypto as an asset class. On the other, the annual jamboree of the elite establishment has all but banished the crypto community. Yet both are indicative of the fact that, as an asset class, crypto has gone fully mainstream \u2014 which means it has peaked.\n\nContinue reading the entire piece here at Bloomberg Opinion (paywall)\n\n___________________\n\nAllison Schrager is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor of City Journal.\n\nPhoto by Nastco/iStock"

        "title": "Not all bitcoin ETFs are the same. Here are some questions to consider before buying any - The Associated Press",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Now that bitcoin funds are trading, which is the best to own?\n\nThe answer is not necessarily the one that rises the most. The job of these funds is to track the price of bitcoin, whatever that is, in what can be a more convenient thing to own for many investors.\n\nSo if bitcoin is falling, for example, a bitcoin fund that\u2019s rising in price may not be doing what an investor is looking for.\n\nThe first question an investor needs to ask before buying one of the bitcoin funds is if they actually want to own bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has been around a decade and a half, but much of professional Wall Street still sees it as too risky and speculative to own.\n\nIt has a history of drastic swings in price, which can come suddenly and happen over the weekend or overnight in its 24/7 trading. Its daily average volatility is roughly three and a half times that of the global stock market, according to John Laforge, head of real asset strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\n\u201cHighlighted a different way, bitcoin\u2019s price return in 2022 was -64%,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile its 2023 return was 157%.\u201d\n\nBut bitcoin also holds the allure of possibly moving in ways that other investments aren\u2019t. Investors are always looking for what\u2019s called an \u201cuncorrelated asset\u201d whose price might zig when everything else they own is zagging. Such independent movements can make an overall portfolio less volatile.\n\nAnother question investors must answer is how they want to buy bitcoin. The main way until now has been to buy it directly and then to either hold it in what\u2019s called a wallet or leave it on an exchange.\n\nNow, following the approval earlier this month by U.S. regulators, investors can buy several exchange-traded funds that will take responsibility for holding actual bitcoin and protecting it. Earlier, bitcoin-related ETFs invested in contracts related to bets on prices for bitcoin in the future, but not on the cryptocurrency itself.\n\nAlready, there\u2019s been some separation in performance among the bitcoin ETFs that have begun trading. Between Jan. 11 and Tuesday, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) sank 14.3%, for example. That\u2019s milder than the 16.3% drop for the Valkyrie Bitcoin fund (BRRR) over the same time.\n\nSo, what should investors be looking at? Here\u2019s a look at several differences:\n\nFEES\n\nWhen many ETFs are trying to do the same thing, such as follow the market price of bitcoin, one of the easiest ways they can distinguish themselves is by charging lower fees.\n\nExpenses are a drag on any investment, and higher fees take more of an investor\u2019s returns away from them. In traditional stock ETFs, fees have plummeted all the way to zero in some cases as expense-conscious investors steer their dollars toward the lowest-cost options.\n\nETFs will advertise their \u201cexpense ratios,\u201d which show how much of a fund\u2019s assets goes toward covering its expenses. Tiny differences in fees may not add up to all that much, even over the course of years, but why pay for something if you don\u2019t have to?\n\nKeep in mind, ETF companies can change their expense ratios, up or down. Fidelity is one of the providers offering a temporary expense ratio of zero on its bitcoin ETF, for example. It will rise to 0.25% in August.\n\nTRADING VOLUMES AND ASSETS\n\nETFs that attract lots of investment and that trade often can make it easier for investors.\n\nFunds that trade more actively can mean a narrower gap between what\u2019s called the \u201cbid\u201d price, or what investors are trying to buy a share of the ETF at, and the \u201cask\u201d price, which is what prospective sellers are hoping to get. A slimmer gap can lower the costs of a transaction when buying or selling the ETF.\n\nTHE CUSTODIAN\n\nOne of the allures of cryptocurrencies is their potential to offer a \u201ctrustless\u201d system where investors don\u2019t have to trust whether the person at the other end of their deal will make good on it, unlike the 2008 financial crisis when banks were going bust.\n\nBut an ETF is firmly within the structure of Wall Street, and it requires trust. For ETFs, what\u2019s called a custodian will be in charge of holding the actual bitcoin and protecting it. Different ETFs are using different custodians. Several are using Coinbase. Others aren\u2019t, including Fidelity, which is housing its bitcoin at Fidelity Digital Asset Services."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSo how\u2019s everyone doing in Bitcoin-land?\n\nNot so good! The chart above shows a drop of nearly 20 per cent in two weeks. As Bryce noted last week, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has mostly been a chance to cash out of arbitrage trades.\n\nUntil recently, traders were able to buy the biggest US Bitcoin investment vehicle \u2014 a fund run by Grayscale \u2014 at a discount to its net asset value. This is because, before approval, investors weren\u2019t actually able to make withdrawals.\n\nNow they can, as the SEC approved Grayscale\u2019s request to convert into an ETF. The fund (ticker GBTC) has seen $4.3bn in outflows since then, says JPMorgan in a note Thursday.\n\nAt first one theory was that investors were shifting out of GBTC and into spot Bitcoin ETFs with lower fees. But the price action suggests otherwise.\n\nFrom JPMorgan\u2019s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou:\n\nProfit-taking on previous GBTC investments, made at a discount to NAV last year, has likely been a major driver behind bitcoin\u2019s correction; $4.3bn has thus far exited GBTC since its conversion to ETF. When profits are booked on GBTC \u2018s \u201cdiscount to NAV trade\u201d the money exits the crypto space, thus putting downward pressure on prices. We believe that most of this $4.3bn GBTC outflow reflects profit taking rather than a shift towards cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs (needless to say that such a shift would have had little market impact).\n\nThere could be a silver lining, though. Panigirtzoglou & Co have previously estimated that about $3bn of GBTC\u2019s assets came from traders investing solely to take advantage of its discount.\n\nSo it\u2019s possible that after $4.3bn of withdrawals, \u201cGBTC profit taking has largely happened already. In turn, this would imply that most of the downward pressure on bitcoin from that channel should be largely behind us,\u201d the team write.\n\nAnd what about the leftover $1.3bn? If we take the most optimistic view, we would assume that all of that cash moved into competing lower-cost Bitcoin ETFs. Of course, that would mean investors aren\u2019t just selling in favour of safer and higher-yielding alternatives (such as US government debt), which seems like a very bold assumption.\n\nStill, JPMorgan argues that the US ETF approvals mean there will be a \u201csignificant change\u201d in the market structure for Bitcoin:\n\n- Before 2023, the price discovery was done via trading across offshore spot exchanges, onshore spot exchanges, offshore futures and onshore (CME) futures. Following last year\u2019s crackdown from US policy makers the importance of offshore marketplaces has diminished to the benefit of onshore spot exchanges and CME bitcoin futures. The emergence of spot ETFs is introducing another dimension in the bitcoin price discovery process along with onshore spot exchanges and onshore futures that echoes the price discovery that is taking place in the traditional financial system, in particular in equities where ETFs are more prevalent. - While, at face value, the introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs implies more fragmentation, in practice it would increase market depth and liquidity if the experience of ETFs in traditional asset classes such as equities is a guide. In other words, we expect that the emergence of spot bitcoin ETFs would make the bitcoin price discovery process more rather than less efficient.\n\nOh and Grayscale is trying to make a covered call Bitcoin ETF happen, which should be interesting:\n\nFinally, GBTC\u2019s plan to introduce a covered call ETF is another step towards increasing market depth and liquidity for its ETF bolstering its status as the most liquid bitcoin fund. These vehicles are often used in the equity space to achieve exposure with less risk (the premiums from selling call options in covered call ETFs tend to offset losses in a declining market, albeit with the tradeoff of smaller gains in a big bull market). If approved, covered call ETFs would be a boost for GBTC\u2019s and, more broadly, bitcoin\u2019s derivatives markets.\n\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af"

He added that it is, however, close to zero.\n\n\"This indicates that puts are more expensive relative to calls, signaling a mildly bearish outlook for these longer-dated expiries,\" Strijers added.\n\nOptions are derivative contracts that give a trader the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, and a put offers the right to sell. It is assumed that a trader who buys put options is implicitly bearish on the market, while a call buyer is bullish."

        "content": "The U.S. government filed a notice announcing its intention to dispose of about $117 million worth of bitcoin seized in a dark web drug bust.\n\nIn the notice dated Jan. 8, the U.S. government said it planned to dispose, \"in such manner as the United States Attorney General may direct,\" nearly 2,875 bitcoin seized from Ryan Farace and Sean Bridges in 2021, in addition to another roughly 59 bitcion that belonged to Farace alone.\n\nAt the time of the filing, the seized bitcoin was worth about $133 million.\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice said it was charging Farace for illegally selling Xanax on the dark web.\n\n\"The indictment alleges that Farace distributed the drugs through sales on the dark web in exchange for bitcoin,\" the DOJ's statement said at the time. Earlier this month, the U.S. Attorney's Office said Farace and his father Joseph Farace had both been sentenced to prison for money laundering conspiracy.\n\nXanaxman used Silk Road\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nFarace, who dealt drugs online under the pseudonym Xanaxman, stated in plea deal that he used Silk Road, the infamous dark web site. The U.S. government also said, in its statement outlining its intent to sell the bitcoin, that anyone that wanted to claim \"interest in the forfeited property\" could do so within 60 days.\n\nSeparately, in December, a U.S. appeals court finalized a mandate formalizing the forfeiture of 69,370 of bitcoin connected to the now-defunct Silk Road dark web market.\n\nMarket watchers have been closely monitoring those funds, often speculating how a large sale of bitcoin by the U.S. government could impact the cryptocurrency's price.\n\nSilk Road's founder Ross Ulbricht is currently serving a life sentence in jail. He operated the dark web site where drugs and weapons were sold from 2011 to 2013. The site was shut down by the Federal Bureau of Investigation following the Ulbricht's arrest in late 2013."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Cryptocurrencies myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT\u2019s Cryptofinance newsletter. This week, we\u2019re looking at Coinbase\u2019s role in the industry\u2019s newly approved bitcoin ETFs.\n\nAfter two weeks of life, there are some things we know about the string of bitcoin exchange traded funds that have proliferated on US stock markets.\n\nThe largest, Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust, is experiencing a huge outflow of assets. The regulatory approval that opened the door for more investors to get exposure to bitcoin can also be the passage to leave a service you\u2019re unhappy with, or simply exit the market altogether.\n\nWe also know that sometimes it\u2019s better to travel than arrive. Since approval was confirmed bitcoin is down about 15 per cent.\n\nBut an important point has thus far flown under the radar: the safety and security of the bitcoins on which the ETFs are built.\n\nLegally speaking the ETF sponsors such as BlackRock, Grayscale, Ark etc hold the bitcoins in a trust; in practice the assets are held by a custodian on behalf of the trust. Eight of the 11 sponsors have chosen Coinbase as their custodian. Fidelity is using its own digital asset custody business.\n\nThis raises eyebrows for two reasons: first, the exchange is being sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly failing to register as a national securities exchange, among other things.\n\nIn one \u2014 narrow, legal \u2014 sense, that lawsuit focuses \u201conly\u201d on whether Coinbase filled in correct forms or not. It doesn\u2019t pass judgment on Coinbase\u2019s capabilities or business practices. Even if the SEC is successful, the lawsuit won\u2019t necessarily hinder Coinbase\u2019s ability to offer custodial services to clients.\n\nSecondly and more importantly \u2014 and I will emphasise this contradiction for as long as the word decentralisation is synonymous with crypto \u2014 Coinbase\u2019s dominance of the custody market is a major single point of failure for the new sector.\n\nAnyone who has paid attention to crypto for even five minutes knows the problems this market has always had in holding and protecting other people\u2019s assets.\n\nMt. Gox customers are still waiting for their money after a hack in 2014 caused the infamous exchange to fail. Investors in Celsius and of course, FTX, are still trying to get their money back.\n\nCoinbase is a different entity and says it maintains very strict walls between its operations. Its exchange and custody business shouldn\u2019t be at risk from market volatility.\n\nStill, imagine \u2014 hypothetically of course \u2014 that Coinbase was hacked or it suddenly collapsed in the manner of many crypto companies before it. What then?\n\n\u201cThere is always a risk that a custodian could collapse, and I think the risk is heightened whenever you\u2019re talking about a less mature market, like crypto is,\u201d said Jeremy Senderowicz of law firm Vedder Price.\n\nI reached out to each of the eight firms with Coinbase, and asked them what their Plan B was, as a back up. Only two responded. WisdomTree and Grayscale both said they could choose to change custodian at their own discretion.\n\nBut we\u2019ve seen crypto companies collapse at speed: will the sponsors be fast enough to react? And if not, what happens to the stranded assets?\n\nBlackRock\u2019s prospectus \u2014 to take one example \u2014 makes things pretty clear.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk that customers\u2019 assets \u2014 including the Trust\u2019s assets \u2014 may be considered the property of the bankruptcy estate of . . . the bitcoin custodian, and customers \u2014 including the Trust \u2014 may be at risk of being treated as general unsecured creditors of such entities and subject to the risk of total loss or markdowns on value of such assets.\u201d\n\nGrayscale\u2019s risk factors are similarly blunt: \u201cThe legal rights of customers with respect to digital assets held on their behalf by a third-party custodian, such as the Custodian, in insolvency proceedings are currently uncertain.\u201d\n\nOuch. It\u2019s not much better if the custodian is hacked.\n\nBlackRock says its bitcoin custodian has insurance coverage \u201cof up to $320mn that covers losses of the digital assets it custodies on behalf of its clients\u201d. That\u2019s not a lot to cover $2bn of assets under management.\n\nIn fairness to Coinbase, it recognises its unique position. \u201cWe are committed to sharing and creating transparent industry standards to develop the security capability of industry peers, and welcome the future diversification of custodianship,\u201d Philip Martin, the exchange\u2019s chief security officer, told me.\n\nCompetition for custody business seems to be on its way. Anchorage Digital Bank \u2014 which holds a bank charter from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \u2014 has designs on the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the natural diversification partner for ETF issuers,\u201d chief executive Nathan McCauley told me on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re spending a lot of time, energy and effort to make sure we capture that.\u201d\n\nFrom a risk management perspective, diversification is always handy. But if a crypto Willie Sutton appears, ETF investors large and small have the same minimal safety net that purchasers of cryptocurrencies have.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on Coinbase\u2019s role as custodian for so many bitcoin ETFs? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of bitcoin ETFs, don\u2019t miss my story this week on bitcoin losing 15 per cent of its value over the past two weeks. Underwhelming flows into the newly approved league of bitcoin ETFs have \u2014 so far \u2014 given the lie to the market\u2019s assumption that new investors would be drawn into bitcoin.\n\n\n\nThe Bank of England and HM Treasury on Thursday responded to a public consultation that brings the UK potentially closer to launching a digital pound. Concerns surrounding user privacy were raised last year, but this week the BoE and HMT committed to introduce primary legislation to parliament aimed at protecting the public\u2019s financial privacy should a digital pound be eventually rolled out.\n\nSoundbite of the week: Drawing battle lines\n\nYou may recall the US Office of Foreign Assets Control imposing sanctions on crypto mixing service Tornado Cash, alleging the platform helped launder billions of dollars worth of illicit funds linked to North Korea-backed criminal hackers.\n\nRoman Storm, one of the developers behind the service, also faces a criminal trial to answer charges of money laundering and the violation of sanctions rules. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nNow he is seeking crowdfunding to pay for his defence.\n\nFolks, I need your help. Whether you\u2019re a passionate developer like me involved with Web 3, or you just care about software and privacy, this legal battle will affect you, so please help contribute to my legal defence because this case will set a major precedent for years to come.\u201d\n\nData Mining: Ether falls with bitcoin\n\nBitcoin went on a four-month surge on expectations that the SEC would finally approve exchange traded funds. The second-largest cryptocurrency, ether, is also on the same regulatory journey \u2014 but its price isn\u2019t enjoying the same boost.\n\nLike bitcoin, it has dropped since the SEC approved the first spot crypto exchange traded funds. This week the SEC pushed back the date for approval of an ether ETF again but there\u2019s still several months to go before the regulator runs out of road and has to make a decision.\n\nBut the market seems to have learned an important lesson: the approval of an exchange traded fund doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the price of the underlying asset is going to fly. Who knew?\n\nFT Cryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford. Please send any thoughts and feedback to cryptofinance@ft.com."

        "content": "The crypto world is rife with scammers, including the Colorado pastor I wrote about on Monday who spent the proceeds from a token hustle on home renovations because \u201cthe Lord told us to.\u201d But one of these scoundrels looms above the others for the sheer perversity of his lies\u2014namely his claim to be Bitcoin\u2019s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto\u2014and for the misery he has inflicted on others with a decade of spurious lawsuits.\n\nLongtime crypto watchers know who I am talking about: Craig Wright. Ordinarily, I make a point of not writing about Wright because part of his con game is to persuade the media to cover his antics, and then use the coverage to advance the claim he is Satoshi. He is not. That\u2019s been clear since at least 2015 when Wright failed to produce a piece of evidence he claimed to possess in the form of Satoshi\u2019s private key. Since then, Wright has been discredited many times over\u2014including over his propensity for forgery and academic plagiarism\u2014yet still he persists with his stupid lawsuits.\n\nThis would be funny but for the people he has harmed. This includes exploiting the U.K.\u2019s dreadful libel laws to nearly ruin Bitcoin podcaster Peter McCormack until an appeals court tossed a ruling to pay Wright\u2019s legal costs because, well, he is a liar who is not Satoshi. Most recently, Wright has turned to another bogus legal strategy in the form of claiming he owns intellectual property related to Bitcoin and then suing developers who help maintain the open-source code.\n\nThe IP claims are nonsense, of course, but Wright nonetheless got some traction in court until Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey stepped in to help the Bitcoin developers mount a defense. That\u2019s when things got decidedly more fun. In October, a U.K. judge agreed to let the developers to press claims of their own that Wright had put forged documents before the court to support his fabrications. The judge set a date for this month to look more closely at the forgery allegations.\n\nNow, lo and behold, Wright is suddenly holding out a settlement offer to the Crypto Open Patent Alliance, which is allied with the defendants. Such a deal is out of character for a charlatan like Wright, and, as several lawyers have pointed out, the only reason he would offer one is that he fears he is in deep trouble. And he is. It is a serious matter to lie to a judge and much worse to file forged documents as evidence. Wright and his lawyers should be very worried.\n\nThe question now is whether the developers will agree to the settlement. So far, it looks like they won\u2019t. On Wednesday, they took to social media to declare \u201chard pass\u201d in part because Wright\u2019s proposed deal included yet more dishonesty. This means the court inquiry into his forgery is set to go forward, setting the table for one of crypto\u2019s worst liars and bullies to face justice.\n\nJeff John Roberts\n\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\n\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nDECENTRALIZED NEWS\n\nCrypto bank Sygnum, which operates in Switzerland and Singapore, raised $40 million to push into Europe.

        "content": "Bitcoin Could Fall to $30,000 in 2024, Says Crypto Billionaire Arthur Hayes\n\nArthur Hayes predicted in a recent market commentary that Bitcoin could plunge to $30,000 in 2024.\n\nHayes, a Bitcoin billionaire known for founding the BitMEX crypto derivatives exchange, published his forecast in a blog post on Wednesday. He warned that Bitcoin could sink as low as $30,000 - $35,000 amidst a potential market downturn triggered by issues in traditional finance.\n\n\"I believe Bitcoin will dip before the BTFP renewal decision on March 12th. I didn\u2019t expect it to happen so soon, but I think Bitcoin will find a local bottom between $30,000 and $35,000,\" wrote Hayes.\n\nThe prediction comes as Bitcoin hovers under $40,000. Hayes blamed the Bitcoin slump on outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the looming expiration of a key Federal Reserve liquidity program.\n\nHayes argued the Fed would likely let its Bank Term Funding Program expire in March instead of renewing it. That could spark a \"mini-financial crisis\" and force the Fed to resume money printing to bail out struggling regional banks.\n\nBitcoin often rallies on expectations of looser Fed policy. But Hayes says the leading cryptocurrency is flashing warning signs that the Fed won't ride to the rescue this time.\n\n\"Bitcoin is telling the world that the Fed is trapped between inflation and a banking crisis,\" explained Hayes. \"The market doesn\u2019t appreciate this fact yet, but Bitcoin does.\"\n\nOnce Bitcoin sinks below $35,000, Hayes says he'll scoop up discounted coins ahead of an eventual Fed policy reversal."

This doesn't include Grayscale's GBTC, which had nearly $30 billion in AUM at the time of its conversion from a closed-end fund to a spot ETF.\n\nInvestors added about $170 million to IBIT on Thursday, with the fund purchasing nearly another 4,300 bitcoin {{BTC}}, pushing total tokens held to 49,952. With the price of bitcoin rising well above the $40,000 level early Friday, that brought AUM to above $2 billion.\n\nNow with over $2 billion in AUM, the fund ranks third in asset gathering among all of the more than 600 ETFs that launched in the past year, noted ETF Store president Nate Geraci , who believes IBIT could soon take over the crown as number one.\n\nThe next fund to cross the $2 billion mark is likely to be Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which held just shy of 44,000 bitcoin as of Jan. 25."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSimply sign up to the Exchange traded funds myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools\n\nThe first derivative-based strategy piggybacking off US-listed bitcoin exchange traded funds has started trading, as experimentation in the fund industry accelerates at breakneck speed.\n\nRoundhill Investments\u2019 Bitcoin Covered Call ETF (YBTC) aims to generate a yield from bitcoin and, like other covered call strategies such as JPMorgan\u2019s wildly popular Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), investors surrender some potential market gains in return.\n\n\u201cThis is a unique intersection of two areas that have been very much in demand, income generation and crypto,\u201d said David Mazza, chief strategy officer at Roundhill.\n\nYBTC is among the first in an anticipated wave of novel ETF launches in the wake of the recent approval of US-listed \u201cspot\u201d bitcoin ETFs investing directly in the cryptocurrency, industry observers say.\n\n\u201cWe are at the beginning, not the end, of ETF innovation tied to cryptocurrencies. The door is open to bring strategies to the public that provide exposure to bitcoin in a risk-on and risk-off manner,\u201d said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a consultancy.\n\nCrypto powerhouse Grayscale Investments has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a Bitcoin Trust Covered Call ETF, which would be based on options on its $23.5bn Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), the world\u2019s largest crypto fund.\n\nOther novel ETFs in the works include proposed vehicles from ProShares and Direxion, which have each filed to launch five ETFs offering leveraged and inverse exposure to bitcoin, amplifying the swings of the already volatile asset.\n\nCovered call ETFs are designed to do the opposite: reduce risk. They work by selling out-of-the-money call options, allowing the purchasers to buy the underlying asset, in this case bitcoin, at a set price and a fixed expiration date. If bitcoin rises sufficiently for this option to be triggered, this caps upside returns for investors, meaning they may underperform the rise in the digital asset.\n\nHowever, the ETF pockets the premium income from writing the options irrespective of what happens \u2014 cushioning investors if the options are triggered, or helping them outperform if they are not.\n\nMazza argued that bitcoin\u2019s high volatility meant it was ideally suited to this approach.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re combining crypto, particularly bitcoin, with a covered call strategy, one of the biggest things is the potential for higher income,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause bitcoin is so volatile as an instrument, when you are selling and capping some of your upside, the benefit is that you get paid a pretty attractive premium for doing so. It has the potential to get a higher yield than you would get with equities.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cmanufactured\u201d income stream may be welcome to some investors because bitcoin has no yield. This is because \u201cmining\u201d of new coins works on the basis of \u201cproof of work\u201d.\n\nMany other cryptocurrencies, such as ether, cardano and polkadot, instead use a \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d mechanism. This allows investors to lock away crypto assets for a set period of time to help support the operation of the blockchain. In return they earn more cryptocurrency, effectively generating income.\n\n\u201cBeing able to invest in GBTC and have a passive long-term exposure to bitcoin, while also allowing having an additional income or yield, is quite attractive,\u201d said Michael Sonnenshein, chief executive of Grayscale.\n\nRosenbluth saw a potential market for covered call ETFs. \u201cThe number one concern that we hear from advisers about bitcoin is that it is volatile, so these products would help alleviate some of these concerns by having some downside protection and income generation,\u201d Rosenbluth said.\n\nBut he pointed out the reverse could also be true. \u201cThe counter is that many people want exposure to bitcoin to take advantage of that volatility. They like that it\u2019s a high-risk/high-reward experience.\u201d\n\nBryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America at Morningstar, also pointed to the allure of volatility, saying he did not \u201cunderstand the desire for a bitcoin covered call ETF\u201d.\n\n\u201cVolatility is why investors buy bitcoin \u2014 capping upside seems antithetical to its investment thesis,\u201d Armour said. He added that a covered call ETF \u201ckeeps the tail risk of bitcoin, meaning if it craters like it did in 2022, investors will still lose a substantial amount of their investment. I don\u2019t see these as a useful product for most investors.\u201d\n\nUntil this month Grayscale\u2019s GBTC was a private trust traded on the over-the-counter market. As such, there were no options listed on it. Sonnenshein hinted that this picture was changing.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to GBTC and growing the ecosystem around it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of investor interest and excitement about the development of an options ecosystem.\u201d\n\nRoundhill, which does not have its own spot bitcoin ETF, is instead basing its options on the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), at $1.8bn by far the largest bitcoin futures ETF.\n\nThis is because, as yet, there are no options listed on the new spot ETFs, although several exchanges have filed with the SEC to launch them.\n\nLatest news on ETFs Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings\n\n\u201cWe are closely monitoring what occurs with spot ETFs,\u201d said Mazza, who added that YBTC has the freedom to \u201cpivot to where the largest options market is\u201d.\n\nYBTC has a fee of 95 basis points. Grayscale has yet to provide details of its proposed ETF.\n\nRosenbluth believed many more flavours of bitcoin exposure were likely to be on the way in the US.\n\nBuffered ETFs \u2014 which use options to provide some downside protection \u2014 are one possibility. Other vehicles such as the Cyber Hornet S&P 500 and Bitcoin 75/25 Strategy ETF (ZZZ), which provides exposure to bitcoin futures and Wall Street stocks, launched late last year.\n\n\u201cIt seems inevitable that we see more asset allocation approaches that incorporate bitcoin exposure in that package.\u201d Rosenbluth said."

        "content": "So much of Bitcoin lore is built around memes.\n\n\u201cStacking sats\u201d describes how to buy into bitcoin without timing the market. \u201cHODL\u201d shows how to survive the volatility without losing one\u2019s nerve, and \u201cBUIDL\u201d offers a blueprint for boosting adoption.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise then that bitcoin\u2019s next halving event is now expected to hit on April 20. Yes, 4/20.\n\nBitcoin seeps fresh coins into circulation through miners, who earn a reward each time they solve. The network slashes that reward by half every 210,000 blocks.\n\nThis is the network\u2019s fourth halving, which means it will take place at block height 840,000. As soon as that block hits, miners will suddenly go from earning 6.25 BTC ($259,000) to 3.125 BTC ($129,500).\n\nRead more: Bitcoin halvings are bull market things \u2014 Will this time be different?\n\nRight now, there are 12,510 blocks to go. There\u2019s however no precise date or time for when Bitcoin will reach that block height. Websites counting down the halving show widely different results, from April 11 to April 21.\n\nCarlos Mercado, data scientist at on-chain analytics firm Flipside Crypto, has meanwhile run 500 simulations of Bitcoin block times and found it will most likely coincide with the Superbowl for cannabis enthusiasts.\n\nBitcoin block times are regulated but random\n\nThe Bitcoin network is built to ensure blocks aren\u2019t solved too quickly, no matter how many miners are active on the network.\n\nMiners are directing more computing power (hash rate) to solving blocks than ever before, and more power means higher chances of mining a block in shorter periods of time. Left unchecked, this would mean the time between Bitcoin blocks would rapidly increase as more miners join the network.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto intended the 21 million bitcoins to be distributed over a long period of time, potentially more than a century; all supply would be issued too quickly if blocks were always mined within seconds rather than minutes.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin\u2019s \u2018genesis\u2019 block of transaction was created 15 years ago\n\nBlocks are mined when a miner supplies a string of digits, known as a \u201chash,\u201d under a certain numerical limit. Bitcoin raises and lowers that limit \u2014 the \u201cdifficulty\u201d \u2014 depending on how quickly miners are supplying those hashes.\n\nOver time, this increases how long it takes for miners to guess those answers and successfully discover blocks.\n\nIn a blog post detailing his simulations, Mercado explained that around every two weeks, Bitcoin checks the time it took to mine the previous 2,016 blocks. If they were \u201cproduced faster than expected, difficulty goes up to decrease production. If the blocks were produced slower than expected, difficulty falls to increase production.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bitcoin hash rate, (the effort of miners to complete proof of work) is the defining factor of block production, but as or even more importantly, the difficulty adjustment every 2,016 blocks is a wholesale shift in how effective the hash rate is,\u201d Mercado told Blockworks.\n\nBitcoin has added 147 blocks per day over the past year. But the difficulty indirectly influences how long it takes to mine blocks and how it plays out in real time is still incredibly random.\n\nBlocks can be discovered within seconds of each other or, in the case of a block mined earlier this week, some aren\u2019t added for more than an hour, with no transactions processed in that time.\n\nMore than 40% of all simulations celebrated 4/20 with a bitcoin halving\n\nSo, Mercado ran hundreds of simulations based on the previous year to see if any patterns emerged. The simulations took into account potential difficulty adjustments forecasted by correlation rates between transaction fees and hash power.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin price tracking ahead of the past 2 halvings \u2014 now 3 months to go\n\nAfter running 500 simulations on the next 100 days of bitcoin mining production, the results showed the bitcoin halving most commonly occurred on April 20 \u2014 more than 200 times compared to 153 for the day after.\n\n\u201cFor the math inclined: the bitcoin daily block production over the last 365 days has a skewness of -0.07 (very small skew to faster than expected block production),\u201d Mercado said.\n\n\u201cThis was because there were three raised difficulty adjustments in a row back in Q1 2023; but otherwise I\u2019d still say the system is working and blocks are generally pacing as expected.\u201d\n\nAnd after all, bitcoin\u2019s all-time high is currently $69,000. The next halving hitting on 4/20 would be only natural.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "11 Publicly-Listed Bitcoin Miners May Not Mine Profitably After Halving: Report\n\nA recent analysis by financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald has raised concerns among Bitcoin miners, suggesting that many may struggle to maintain profitability following the upcoming halving event. The report highlights that eleven of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners could face significant financial pressure if the price of BTC remains at the current $40,000 level after the halving.\n\nThe report identifies Argo Blockchain and Hut 8 Mining as the two miners most likely to face profitability issues after the halving, with their \"all in\" cost-per-coin rates currently exceeding the current Bitcoin price. In total, 11 Bitcoin miners have estimated cost-per-coin exceed the $40,000 level.\n\nIn contrast, Cantor analysts expect Singapore-based Bitdeer and U.S.-based CleanSpark to remain profitable, assuming an average Bitcoin price of $40,000 and no significant changes in hash rate. The report estimated that the cost-per-coin for Bitdeer is $17,744, while CleanSpark\u2019s stands at $36,896.\n\nThe analysis was cited by CleanSpark executive chairman and co-founder Matthew Shultz in a January 25th post.\n\nAs Bitcoin miners' revenues are directly tied to the price of Bitcoin, miners may experience increased challenges in ensuring the revenue generated from mining Bitcoin can be profitable after covering operational costs.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April, involves a 50% reduction in the block rewards received by Bitcoin miners. While this supply reduction is generally viewed as bullish for Bitcoin's long-term price prospects, it also means that miners with high operational costs could face severe challenges if the price of Bitcoin does not rise sufficiently to cover these costs."

The firm upgraded Coinbase's stock from Perform to Outperform, setting a price target of $160 per share.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) is rebounding above $41,000 following a dip a week after spot bitcoin ETFs were approved\n\nYahoo Finance's Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: Coinbase shares are getting a boost with Oppenheimer upgrading the stock to outperform from perform. And initiating its price target at $160 per share. The analyst behind the call citing Coinbase as a stronger than many people-- has stronger than many people realize. Excuse me. There you're taking a look at the price target $160 here. We were taking a look at the shares a moment ago.\n\nAnd this is actually a lift for the broader kind of crypto and the crypto trading names out there as well. We were tracking Marathon. That's one of the top trending tickers on the \"Yahoo Finance\" platform right now this morning. Pre-market, with about six minutes until the start of trade, and Bitcoin, as well. Perhaps, we can take a quick look at that just to see how things are faring there. Because, ultimately, over the course of this week, there was a lot of concern about whether or not we'd be able to keep this 40,000 level. We eventually got back up to. And now, have exceeded it. We're up by about 3% for Bitcoin here today too.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah. Certainly, we are seeing some optimism creep back into the markets. Again, putting this in perspective, Bitcoin had been under a tremendous amount of pressure ever since we did get that decision from the SEC. A lot of that thought, though, some of that optimism of an approval already baked into the price. So we did see a bit of cooling. And you can see that a bit reflected in that stock chart that we have up there on the screen right now.\n\nSo we are above that 41,000 level now. Question is, how much higher can we climb? Can we get back to that 46,000, 47,000 level that we saw not too long ago. And again, because we're seeing the price of Bitcoin rise here, obviously, other names like Coinbase among the big leaders in today's market action.\n\nBut Oppenheimer here in this upgrade of Coinbase calling out a number of catalysts here. One, the prospect of stronger earnings, and also improving fundamentals. Because of that, they're raising the price target to 160. About $40 higher than where it's trading today."

Still, VanEck crypto research head Matthew Sigel said the flows remain in line with the firm\u2019s projections.\n\nNet inflows into the funds have shrunk to $745 million, Bloomberg Intelligence data shows, as the ETFs collectively bled about $420 million in each of this week\u2019s first four days.\n\nThe combined spot bitcoin ETF net inflow figure, since their launches on Jan. 11, goes up significantly \u2014 to more than $5.5 billion \u2014 when excluding the heavy outflows endured by Grayscale Investments\u2019 Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC).\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF Tracker\n\nNearly $4.8 billion has left the Grayscale fund since its conversion to an ETF. The sales come after investors in recent years had no way to sell shares of the fund without doing so on the secondary market at a substantial discount.

BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) on Thursday saw $171 million and $101 million of net inflows, respectively.

        "title": "Beware the crypto bull run predictions in 2024 - Fortune",
        "content": "Aside from the high-profile court cases, much of 2023 was a fairly lackluster year for crypto. Market activity remained mostly flat compared to the historical average. Major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) traded sideways all year, and total volume locked (TVL) in decentralized finance ecosystems drifted within a narrow range, far below all-time highs. This lack of dramatic volatility was far from the norm we usually associate with crypto assets. The minor pricing pump in Q4 closed out the year on a positive note.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a year for making money. But the recent green light from the Securities and Exchange Commission for 11 Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) applications, featuring heavyweight players such as BlackRock, Ark Investments/21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco, and VanEck has led to a notable upswing in the crypto market, expressing optimistic outlook. Speculation is rife that a sustained bull run will replace this latest crypto winter.\n\nWhile I remain bullish on digital assets and the wider crypto industry on a long-term horizon, there\u2019s reason to remain cautious going into 2024. Investors face mixed signals, and it\u2019s possible the good news regarding Bitcoin ETF approval\u2013which has been leading crypto headlines for some months\u2013has already been priced in.\n\nWhile markets didn\u2019t skyrocket last year, they also didn\u2019t crater. There has been sufficient optimism to maintain pricing stability. That optimism is largely related to two major events in 2024: the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETF and the potential approval of Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., as well as the upcoming Bitcoin halving. The ETF approvals are expected to bring improved trading volumes and liquidity to crypto markets in general, and the halving will prevent BTC deflation and thus support prices.\n\nMany pundits have attributed the Q4 pricing pump to these factors, and that\u2019s been coupled with bullish activity in the derivatives market as well. Investors overall appear to believe that central bank rate hikes are mostly behind us and that there\u2019s enough weight to these optimistic murmurings to look forward to a breakout bull run in 2024.\n\nDespite the undeniably positive impact of institutional endorsements and the market sentiment reflected by the recent pricing upswing, I believe there is some truth to the Wall Street saying \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d here. The crypto market is forward-looking, and traders who have already bought the rumor might be waiting to sell regardless of what the news is.\n\nAfter the initial surge on the back of the highly anticipated news, markets may quickly pare those gains as wider adoption fails to keep pace. A subsequent correction could take place before an actual bull run begins. ETFs are a big step\u2013but not nearly enough to declare we\u2019ve achieved mass crypto adoption. While the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs is a big win, I won\u2019t be holding my breath for new all-time highs for crypto asset prices or total value locked (TVL) in the short run.\n\nAs for BTC\u2019s halving in Q2, it will support markets but it\u2019s unlikely to drive a full-fledged bull run. This anti-inflationary measure makes mining new BTC more difficult, restricting supply. In the absence of significant crypto adoption, this alone isn\u2019t enough to take us back to BTC\u2019s peak of nearly $69,000, let alone surpass it.\n\nOn the other hand, an additional reason for optimism is the fact that 2024 is an election year in the U.S. We can expect U.S. regulators to tone down their headline-seeking activities in this high-stakes year. As such, there ought to be less bad news on the horizon for crypto that has the potential to dent investors\u2019 enthusiasm. This can possibly set the stage for the next bullish trend.\n\nAll in all (and Black Swan events aside), 2024 is shaping up to be more of the same for crypto asset prices. My base case scenario is that the market will bottom out and begin recovering more meaningfully by Q4 2024. In the meantime, we can expect some minor volatility as investors whiplash from heady anticipation to mild disappointment.\n\nHowever, the overall relative lack of volatility indicates that the crypto finance market is maturing, and thus our investment and trading strategies must mature as well.\n\nRachel Lin is a co-founder and CEO of SynFutures, a decentralized derivatives trading platform.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune."

Jared Blikre here with a crypto watch for us today, but I suspect it's not making up for some of its recent declines.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: A little bit, fractional, and let's take a look at the chart here in a second. Bitcoin up 5.41%. That's the best 24-hour period in weeks.\n\nAnd here is a six-month chart. And this was looking a little bit toppy in here, and we did have a false breakdown. I'm calling it false now because we've had significant momentum to the upside from what could have been or what's looking like support that was looking like it just broke. But if you're following the logic here, false breakdown nothing new to Bitcoin, and we are seeing a run up.\n\nAnd we are seeing continuation and some movement in other Bitcoin-related cryptocurrencies here. Solana up 6.8%. But really Bitcoin, unusually, is in the pole position today.\n\nWant to show you, though, this year has not been about crypto. In fact, TRX is the only non-stable-coin in the green here. Lots of movement to the downside.\n\nAnd, of course, if you take a look at the last year, it's a different picture. Solana up 283%.\n\nBut let me show you the crypto-linked stocks as well, and I'll get back to an intraday basis. Crypto stocks really popping today, and you can see this in Galaxy. That's up 14%. Bakkt up 11%. Marathon Digital, that's up 8.79%. The list goes on, and a lot of these have just been underwater for the year, and here's a look at that.\n\nNow PayPal, arguably Bitcoin exposure is pretty low there. That's the only one in the green, and it's looking a lot worse for a lot of these other names there. So just kind of gaining some of that lost territory that we've seen.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd also want to get an update of the ETF situation for Bitcoin. We have all these spot Bitcoin ETFs. By the way, this board has more than just Bitcoin ETFs. If you take a look in the upper left, BKCH actually has exposure to blockchain companies. So it's more linked to, I believe, crypto stocks, and that's why you're seeing that up a bit more.\n\nAnd then we're seeing some of these other tech-- we're seeing some of these other ones tick to the downside. This is an inverse Bitcoin ETF, so that explains what we're seeing there. But all in all, a nice day for crypto.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Jared Blikre, thank you for that. Appreciate it."

        "content": "Swan Bitcoin Launches Mining Venture, Plans For Public Listing\n\nSwan Bitcoin, a Bitcoin-focused financial services firm, has disclosed the launch of its Bitcoin mining venture, Swan Mining, which has been operating in stealth mode since last summer. The company aims to expand its institutional offerings and is actively pursuing a public listing within the next 12 months.\n\nSwan's decision to establish a mining unit stems from its vision of becoming a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d Bitcoin company. Swan emphasizes that its mining business operates independently, utilizing a debt-free funding model and maintaining legal segregation from its other business arms. The company intends to allocate its next Series C funding equally among its financial services, mining, and acquisitions ventures.\n\nSwan Mining has already achieved notable success, having mined 750 Bitcoin (BTC) with its current hash rate capacity of 4.5 exahashes per second (EH/s). The firm anticipates surpassing 8 EH/s in March upon the deployment of new mining equipment.\n\nSwan's CEO, Cory Klippsten, is actively working towards achieving a public listing within the next 12 months. He said:\n\n\u201cSwan Mining is a great example of our company thesis playing out. With our exclusive focus on Bitcoin adoption and helping the industry grow, we continue to attract the talent, opportunities, and capital required to launch new business lines and grow them rapidly.\u201d\n\nDespite the focus on its mining venture, Swan assures that its financial services unit remains healthy and continues to grow. The company claims to have generated $125 million in revenue over the last 12 months and doubled its staff count."

        "content": "The price of bitcoin rebounded above $41,000 this morning, with outflows for Grayscale\u2019s GBTC converted spot ETF slowing for the third consecutive day.\n\nData from BitMEX Research shows GBTC witnessed outflows of $394.1 million on Jan. 25, down from $429.3 million on Wednesday and $515.3 million on Tuesday. While the GBTC outflows remain very high, yesterday\u2019s figure is the second-lowest since the first trading day for the spot bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 11.\n\nThe nine newborn spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 BlackRock (IBIT), Fidelity (FBTC), Bitwise (BITB), Ark 21Shares (ARKB), Invesco (BTCO), VanEck (HODL), Valkyrie (BRRR), Franklin Templeton (EZBC) and WisdomTree (BTCW) \u2014 are yet to witness any daily outflows.\n\nIBIT registered the largest inflows yesterday with $170.7 million. FBTC generated $101 million worth of inflows and BITB was in third with $20 million. However, total inflows from the nine of $314.30 on Thursday were not enough to overcome GBTC outflows, creating a net outflow of nearly $80 million.\n\nOverall, the spot bitcoin ETFs have witnessed net inflows of $744.6 million since launch \u2014 with the newborn nine totaling $5.53 billion of inflows and GBTC registering total outflows of $4.79 billion.\n\nBitcoin BTC -7.10% is currently trading up 3% over the past 24 hours at $41,328, according to The Block\u2019s price page. However, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap had previously fallen over 20% from a high of around $49,000 on the day the spot bitcoin ETFs launched to $38,600 on Jan. 23.\n\nLiquidations spike after bitcoin uptick\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rise above the $41,000 mark, caused over $110 million in liquidations on centralized exchanges in the past 24 hours.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nThe majority of crypto liquidations involved short positions, leading to a loss of over $66 million, while long positions contributed around $44 million to the total liquidations, according to Coinglass data.\n\nIn derivatives markets, liquidations take place when a trader's position is forcibly closed due to insufficient funds to cover losses. This situation arises when market movements are unfavorable to the trader's position, resulting in the depletion of their initial margin or collateral.\n\nThe volatility that shook out many leveraged positions was elevated compared to the beginning of the month. The Block's data dashboard puts current annualized bitcoin volatility at 53.95%, an increase from a low of around 42% at the beginning of January.\n\nMore downside to come?\n\nJPMorgan analysts, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, wrote in a note on Thursday that they expect limited further downside for bitcoin as profit-taking in GBTC has largely concluded. The cashing in of profits by GBTC investors was behind the recent decline in bitcoin's price, according to the analysts, but the worst appears to be over now. However, they cautioned that if GBTC's 1.5% fee isn't reduced soon, the fund could experience ongoing outflows and lose market share to rivals with cheaper fees.\n\nGBTC investors \u2014 who over the past year had been buying the fund's shares at a significant discount to net asset value to position for a potential ETF conversion \u2014 were \"taking full profit post-ETF conversion by exiting the bitcoin space entirely rather than shifting to cheaper spot bitcoin ETFs,\" the JPMorgan analysts previously noted last week.\n\nChris Burniske, Partner at Placeholder VC who previously led crypto at Ark Invest, is not so sure, speculating that bitcoin will fall to \u201cat least\u201d $30,000 to $36,000 before a local bottom. \u201c[I] wouldn't be surprised if we test the mid-to-high 20s before all is said and done, and we can make an actual move towards previous ATHs,\u201d Burniske posted on X.\n\nBurniske said he continues to believe the long-term trend remains robust but warned about volatility. \u201cDon't ignore we also just saw many of our first parabolas of the cycle, and they're now breaking... and macro looks precarious on a number of levels,\u201d he added. \u201cNew product innovations are close, but not quite there yet... things still feel insular.\u201d"

        "content": "The driving force behind the recent sell-off in bitcoin may have run its course, according to JPMorgan. Bitcoin rallied in the second half of 2023 as optimism around the approval of exchange traded funds grew, but their debut earlier this month has proven to be a \"sell the news\" event for the world's largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin briefly traded above $49,000 shortly before the funds launched, but then fell more than 20% before seeming to stabilize around $40,000. BTC.CM= YTD mountain Bitcoin has retreated since the approval of bitcoin ETFs. JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note to clients Thursday that the main source of the selling has come from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) . The fund, which traded at a steep discount as an over-the-counter product before investors became confident that a conversion to an ETF would happen, has seen heavy outflows over the past two weeks. \"Profit-taking on previous GBTC investments, made at a discount to [net asset value] last year, has likely been a major driver behind bitcoin's correction; $4.3bn has thus far exited GBTC since its conversion to ETF,\" Panigirtzoglou said. Some outflows from GBTC were expected, given the prior discount and its high cost relative to other bitcoin ETFs. Panigirtzoglou, who had estimated $3 billion of outflows, said that the decline is likely profit taking rather than a sign that the cash is moving to other options, and that the outflows should slow from here. \"We conclude that GBTC profit taking has largely happened already. In turn, this would imply that most of the downward pressure on bitcoin from that channel should be largely behind us,\" Panigirtzoglou said. Even with the outflows from GBTC, the fund still has about $20 billion in assets under management. And some of the other bitcoin ETFs are seeing big inflows, with funds from iShares ( IBIT ) and Fidelity Wise Origin ( FBTC ) both surpassing $1 billion in inflows. The total inflows and decline in price of bitcoin have missed the optimistic estimates of some crypto bulls, but the dollar amounts are still large compared to other ETF launches."

It follows a Tuesday note from JPMorgan claiming that the ETF catalyst would \u201cdisappoint market participants.\u201d\n\nNewly-approved spot bitcoin ETFs logged their single largest day of outflows Wednesday. Investors cashed out on $429 million worth of GBTC, bringing the product\u2019s total outflows to roughly $4.4 billion in nine days of trading.\n\nBitcoin has spent much of the week trading below $40,000 after topping $49,000 in the immediate aftermath of the ETF approvals.\n\nRead more: Spot bitcoin ETF net outflows hit highest level yet on day 9 of trading\n\nJPMorgan previously estimated $3 billion would depart GBTC as investors took profit on the ETF trading below the value of bitcoin, the note said.

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs cause concerns for financial advisors - Financial Planning",
        "content": "Brett Bernstein has a simple question for clients who come to him with curiosity about bitcoin and other digital assets .\n\n\"If you were to go with me to Las Vegas for the weekend, how much would you be willing to put on one number and one color at the roulette wheel?\" said the CEO and co-founder of XML Financial Group in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nWith the Securities and Exchange Commission's historic approval on Jan. 10 of 11 exchange-traded funds tracking the value of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, Bernstein and other advisors are likely to hear only more questions about the possible benefits and downsides of digital assets.\n\n\n\nLet's have some fund\n\nFor many advisors, exchanged-traded funds are one of their clients' best friends. ETFs tracking broad market indexes like the S&P 500 offer investors exposure to a vast array of stocks. And because the funds are bought and sold on public exchanges just like equities and bonds, they also make it easy for clients to pull money out as needed.\n\nBut the new bitcoin ETFs are a different animal . Rather than tracking all the stocks in a particular index, they offer ownership in only one particular asset: bitcoin. And bitcoin has proved to be fairly volatile.\n\nThe most widely known cryptocurrency now trades at around $40,000 and, in the past three or so years, has seen its price rise as high as $65,000 and fall below $12,000. Its value increased by 160% in 2023 amid widespread expectation that the SEC would approve bitcoin ETFs only to fall slowly in recent weeks.\n\nSuch fluctuation is reason enough for many advisors to be skeptical. Bernstein said he does not rule out cryptocurrencies, especially for clients who have enough money to shoulder losses and enough appetite for risk to try something outside the norm.\n\nBut he does caution them to not put down anything they can't afford to lose. The new ETFs may have made it easier to invest in bitcoin, Bernstein said, \"but we as a firm have not changed.\"\n\n\"It's still a very speculative investment,\" he added. \"And I think it's inappropriate for a lot of clients.\"\n\n\n\nFlowing in\n\nThe 11 new bitcoin ETFs have proved popular to investors, drawing in about $4 billion within a week of their approval. Lori Van Dusen , the CEO and founder of LVW Advisors in Rochester, New York, said her clients have taken note of the new opportunity.\n\nShe said even some of the large and mid-sized institutional investors her firm works with have begun to ask about digital assets, whereas in the past they had \"zero interest in even talking about this.\" Van Dusen said some of her clients \u2014 who tend to be high net worth and ultrahigh net worth \u2014 like to buy gold as a hedge against the possibility that the U.S. dollar will plummet in value amid ballooning federal deficits.\n\nSome now think bitcoin and similar assets can serve a similar purpose. Others, Van Dusen said, look at cryptocurrencies as offering them an opportunity to be a venture investor supporting one of the next great leaps in technological innovation.\n\nAn advisors' chief responsibility in all of this, she said, is to help clients gauge how much they can afford to put into crypto with the understanding that \"you could lose everything.\"\n\nAs a rule of thumb, Van Dusen said she thinks no investor should have more than 5% of a portfolio in digital assets, a figure that of course should be adjusted down depending on individual circumstances. Van Dusen said she herself has invested in bitcoin \u2014 partly as a hedge against the U.S. dollar \u2014 and has \"done pretty well.\"\n\n\n\nRegulatory mixed blessing\n\nAlthough the funds have received the government's official sanction, many regulators still view them with skepticism. SEC Commissioner Gary Gensler backed approval for the ETFs only after his initial attempt at blocking them was swatted down by a lawsuit . In giving them funds the greenlight, he cautioned that bitcoin is a \"speculative, volatile asset that's also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion and terrorist financing.\"\n\nRegulators have also been urging financial advisors to take care in their discussions of bitcoin and other digital assets with clients. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority , the brokerage industry's self-regulator, released a report on Tuesday suggesting that firms are violating its communications rules in a good deal of what they tell investors about crypto.\n\nLooking at 500 communications that firms had with their clients on digital assets and similar topics, FINRA discovered possible violations in 70% of them. Among other red flags, some brokerages were found to be implying the crypto assets can act like cash or cash equivalents.\n\nAlmost all advisors agree that caution is due with digital assets. But some take a slightly more favorable view than others.\n\n\n\nMany investors already have it\n\nRic Edelman, the founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals , or DACFP, said 40% U.S. adults already own bitcoin and thus are likely to have taken some notice of the SEC's approval of bitcoin ETFs. Financial planners, he said, should jump on the opportunity to explain to investors what these new funds mean.\n\nHe said DACFP, which offers financial planners an online certificate in blockchain and digital assets, has seen a sharp increase in the number of advisors who are reaching out for help understanding bitcoin ETFs. In response, it released an Advisor Toolkit offering answers to some of the more commonly asked questions.\n\nIn keeping with his belief that more investors could benefit from putting money in digital assets, Edelman cheered the arrival of bitcoin ETFs. Giving the usual caveat about every investor's circumstances being different, Edelman said, \"Bitcoin is still a very risky investment, so a 1% to 5% allocation would not interfere with a client's ability to retire in financial comfort if it were to become worthless. Meanwhile, a 1% to 5% allocation can materially improve the overall return of the portfolio if bitcoin performs as well as many predict.\"\n\n\n\nYou can always walk away\n\nOthers remain skeptical. Ryan Kenny, a director and portfolio manager at Crestwood Advisors in Boston , said it's incumbent upon him to listen to his clients' investing ideas and try to accommodate them within reason. That's true even if they're considering a risky asset like bitcoin.\n\nKenny agreed that anyone committing part of a portfolio to digital assets should take care to keep the allocation small. Even then, his preference is to guide clients to long-term investments in well-understood assets like quality stocks and bonds.\n\nThe trouble with cryptocurrencies, he said, is not only in their volatility.\n\n\"It doesn't produce earnings or dividends, making it difficult to assign any intrinsic value to it,\" he said. \"Those things combined don't line up with our investment philosophy.\"\n\nBernstein of XML Financial Group said advisors of course can't be forced into doing something that they firmly believe would go against their clients' best interest. If an investor insists on putting an unreasonably large sum of money into cryptocurrencies or other unusually risky assets, sometimes the best response is to walk away.\n\n\"If someone comes to me and says, 'I want you to put 65% of my portfolio into bitcoin,' I'm going to say, 'I think you are committing financial malpractice and potentially financial suicidal,'\" Bernstein said. \"And if they insist, I'm going to say they need to take their business elsewhere, because I have a responsibility not to allow clients to do something that would potentially cause them serious harm.\""

        "content": "Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) moved more than 19,000 bitcoin [BTC] from its publicly known wallet Wednesday morning. Since the spot bitcoin ETFs opened for business on Jan. 11, Grayscale has now moved nearly 113,000 bitcoin from its wallet, the overwhelming majority of which was to Coinbase Prime in preparation for sale, according to data compiled from Arkham.\n\nThe Grayscale website Wednesday morning showed GBTC as holding roughly 537,000 bitcoin, down about 100,000 BTC since Jan. 11.\n\nAs Arkham noted, one caveat to the observed movement of bitcoin out of the Grayscale wallet is that not all of that may be related to redemption. \"The outflows are usually split between Coinbase Prime and new GBTC custody addresses,\" said Arkham. \"This means that not all of the BTC moved is being redeemed. The outflows appear to be settlements of trading activity for the previous day(s).\"\n\nDue to the input-output structure of its blockchain, Bitcoin transaction outputs are often split amongst multiple addresses.\n\n\n\nGBTC custody wallets frequently send to multiple addresses, most often a Coinbase Prime deposit and a fresh GBTC custody address. This means that some of\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Oml9IhLDMp \u2014 Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) January 24, 2024\n\nGBTC has seen this massive outflow for any number of reasons, but principally as Grayscale cut its management fee just 50 basis points to 1.50% following the conversion to a spot ETF. That's more than 100 basis points higher than the other nine competing bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale has now seen the departure of more than 10,000 bitcoin per day for several days running. The exit of bitcoin combined with the decline in the price of bitcoin has led to a fall in assets under management (AUM) by more than $1 billion each day this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe hopes of bitcoin bulls were momentarily buoyed earlier this week on a Monday CoinDesk report that the FTX estate had unloaded its 22 million share GBTC holding. With this non-economic whale seller out of the way, the bulls hoped there might be a slowdown in GBTC exits. To this point though, this hasn't happened, as evidenced by this morning's movement of 19,000 bitcoin to exchange.\n\nRead more: Crypto Whales Hunt for Bargains As Bitcoin Prices Slide, Data Shows\n\nUpdate (1/25/2024 14:50 UTC): Adds detail noting the decline in AUM is due a combination of reduced bitcoin in fund and lower prices.

Just ignore them, one Wall Street legend says.\n\n\"That's useless, and it's the wrong way to think about investing,\" Burton Malkiel told Business Insider this week. \"Nobody knows what the market's going to do in the short term.\"\n\n\"Don't try to time the market \u2014 you can't do it and you're more likely to get it wrong than right,\" he continued. \"And don't think you can be a stock picker this year, it never works.

The legendary stock picker has said that almost everyone should steadily invest in a S&P 500 tracker fund over the course of decades. Meanwhile, Vanguard's founder has underscored the danger of fees by saying that \"in investing, you get what you don't pay for.\"\n\nBack in 2020, Malkiel rang the alarm on the day-trading boom as the antithesis of that approach. In the interview this week, he called out the same kind of mindless speculation on meme stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"Absolutely that still is in my view a real danger,\" he said. \"Most people are going to lose their shirts.\"\n\nMalkiel singled out bitcoin as especially worrisome, given its volatility and lack of utility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is not a useful currency, its only uses are to hide things from the government and for ransomware,\" Malkiel said. \"I don't want to go in and buy my Starbucks coffee in the morning with bitcoin which might be worth $45,000 one day and $40,000 the next.\"\n\nThe former Vanguard director, dean of Yale's management school, and White House economic advisor also weighed in on the stock market.\n\n\"There's no question about the fact that valuations are high,\" he said, although he noted that price-to-earnings multiples on the hottest technology stocks are still a fraction as high as during the dot-com bubble.\n\nStill, he warned that lofty prices would likely weigh on portfolio performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"When valuations are above average, long-run returns are going to be somewhat lower\" than their roughly 10% annual average over the last century, he said. \"There's probably somewhat greater optimism about returns than there should be. People ought to be very modest in their expectations.\"\n\nAs for the economy, Malkiel emphasized the futility of trying to call the next downturn.\n\n\"Not only do I think you can't predict the stock market, but neither the market, the Fed board of governors, or economists can tell you if we're gonna have the recession,\" he said. \"I don't have any idea, and neither does anybody else.\"\n\nMalkiel concluded by reiterating the core message of his letter: \"Regular saving, even for people of very modest means, can get you a wonderful retirement portfolio,\" he said. \"The American dream is not over.\""

        "content": "Bitcoin BTC -7.10% futures open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has declined by more than $1 billion since its peak on Jan. 10, whilst derivatives open interest on Deribit has increased, according to Deribit Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers.\n\n\"The decline in CME futures open interest for bitcoin contrasts with the relative stability observed in Deribit's BTC options or futures open interest. Bitcoin options open interest on Deribit is up 3% in contracts and futures and perpetuals open interest is up around $100 million since Jan. 10,\" Strijers said in an email to The Block.\n\nDifference in CME and Deribit open interest trends\n\nThe Deribit Chief Commercial Officer said the declining trend in open interest on CME could imply several underlying market movements.\n\n\"The decrease in CME futures open interest might suggest that investors, especially those from traditional finance sectors, are adapting their investment strategies. With the introduction of spot ETFs, these investors might find spot ETFs a more straightforward and efficient way to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies,\" Strijers said.\n\nHe added that the ease of trading and lower costs associated with ETFs, compared to futures contracts, could be a compelling reason for this shift in market behavior.\n\nMarket becoming less volatile\n\nTomorrow's end of January expiry date for outstanding options and futures contracts is particularly noteworthy, with around $3.7 billion in bitcoin options notional open interest set to expire and a max pain level at $41,000.\n\n\"As we approach tomorrow's options expiry, it's clear the market is steadily recovering from the initial shocks of the ETF introduction and the GBTC unwind,\" Strijers added.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nStrijers said that the Deribit Volatility Index for bitcoin has decreased significantly after witnessing a significant uptick after the launch of multiple spot bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10.\n\n\"The volatility index has plummeted from over 70 during the start of the GBTC unwind and ETF launch, to now hovering around 45,\" he added. Another key metric that he highlighted was bitcoin annualized futures basis, which he said has seen a significant decline.\n\n\"Before the ETF launch, the annualized futures basis figure was over 20%, but it's now stabilized between 8-10%,\" he added. The basis is a rate between the bitcoin futures price and the BTC spot price.\n\nStrijers added that another factor at play in causing a decline in CME bitcoin futures open interest could be that investors are seeing more value in using options on Deribit as a tool for hedging, speculative purposes, and obtaining exposure in general. He added that the relative stability on Deribit suggests that investors outside of the U.S. are relying on options for their different risk profiles and strategic purposes."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has always been a volatile asset. Not long ago, it was toying with $50,000 a coin, and now, it\u2019s struggling to stay above the $40,000 mark. The arrival of a range of new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that trade in Bitcoin certainly helped. And today, it\u2019s up just over 6%, bringing several Bitcoin stocks along with it.\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) added nearly 4%, and HIVE Blockchain (NASDAQ:HIVE) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) posted over 6%. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), which owns so much Bitcoin its share price frequently moves in sympathy with Bitcoin\u2019s, was up nearly 8%. Finally, Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) added over 9% in Friday afternoon\u2019s trading.\n\nThe reasons behind the sudden surge weren\u2019t exactly clear, as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has already been priced into the market for some time now. Following that, Bitcoin seemed to undergo what some called a \u201csell-the-news correction,\u201d which sent prices back down. But the selling frenzy seems to have passed, at least for now, and Bitcoin prices are making their way back up once more.\n\nCore Confidence Dropping?\n\nIn what may be a problem for Bitcoin\u2014and the stocks so closely connected to it\u2014there are signs of concern from retail investors. Yet, word from 10x Research\u2019s head of research, Markus Thielen, suggests that now is \u201c\u2026not the time to turn bearish,\u201d instead looking for positive catalysts from the U.S. election cycle to boost asset prices.\n\nWhich Bitcoin Stocks are a Good Buy Right Now?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, HIVE stock is the clear leader right now. With an average price target of $6.17, this Moderate Buy-rated stock offers an upside potential of 86.12%. Meanwhile, COIN stock is the laggard, as this Hold-rated stock with an average price target of $128.58 can only offer a 2.54% upside potential.\n\nDisclosure"

        "content": "CoinShares is the latest firm set to slash fees on its European bitcoin product in the weeks after the first spot BTC funds launched in the US.\n\nThe company said Thursday it would reduce the annual fee on its physically backed bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) from 0.98% to 0.35%. The change is slated to take place on Feb. 1.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that as the market for crypto assets continues to mature and expand, our assets under management will grow significantly,\u201d Frank Spiteri, CoinShares\u2019 head of asset management, told Blockworks in an email. \u201cThis growth in assets will, over time, more than offset the short-term impact of reduced fees.\u201d\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF Tracker\n\nThe move matched that made by rival WisdomTree last week, when the company chose to reduce the fees on its bitcoin and ethereum ETPs from 0.95% to 0.35%. The firm also cut its fees on six other products, including reductions for its Crypto Market ETP and Crypto Altcoins ETP \u2014 from 1.45% to 0.70%.\n\nThe eight WisdomTree ETPs trade on B\u00f6rse Xetra and the Swiss Stock Exchange known as SIX, as well as Euronext exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s landmark approval of funds that hold bitcoin directly has reignited discussions around retail and institutional demand for crypto, according to Alexis Marinof, WisdomTree\u2019s head of Europe.\n\nThose US funds have notched net inflows of $824 million after nine days of trading. When excluding the heavy outflows endured by Grayscale Investments\u2019 Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), the combined net inflows amount to about $5.2 billion.\n\n\u201cThe launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in the US has captured a lot of attention in Europe, yet many investors aren\u2019t aware that they\u2019ve been able to access the same spot crypto exposure through physically backed ETPs since 2019,\u201d Marinof said in a statement last week.\n\nLike WisdomTree, fund giant Invesco last week lowered the fee for its Physical Bitcoin ETP \u2014 from 0.99% to 0.39%.\n\nGary Buxton, Invesco\u2019s head of Europe ETFs, told the Financial Times the drop came after issuers launching spot bitcoin ETFs in the US \u201cworked to find the new equilibrium between supply and demand.\u201d\n\nNine of those 10 US funds sport fees ranging from 0.19% to 0.39% \u2014 with Grayscale\u2019s product being an outlier, at 1.5%.\n\nRead more: Investors are \u2018the clear winners\u2019 as bitcoin ETF fee battle comes into focus\n\n\u201cThe competitive levels of fees in recent US ETF launches have indeed played a part in our global strategy towards pricing,\u201d Spiteri said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note, however, that our decision to lower fees on our ETPs in Europe was not solely a reaction to these trends.\u201d\n\nWisdomTree and Invesco both offer a US spot bitcoin ETF in addition to their European offerings. CoinShares recently exercised its option to acquire the fund arm of Valkyrie Investments, which also launched a US spot bitcoin fund.\n\nThe WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) and the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) carry a fee of 0.30% and 0.39%, respectively. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) is priced at 0.25%.\n\nFranklin Templeton currently offers the lowest fee for a US spot bitcoin ETF, at 0.19%.\n\nA European bitcoin ETP by 21Shares has a management fee of 0.21% \u2014 though that product takes part in collateralized lending to achieve that price point.\n\nUpdated Jan. 25, 2023 at 4:05 pm ET: Added quote from CoinShares\u2019 head of asset management.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Bitcoin Halving Could Put Miners Out of Business \u2013 Can RIOT, Marathon Weather the Storm? - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nIn April, Bitcoin mining rewards will shrink by 50%.\n\nPost-halving, less efficient mining companies might go out of business.\n\nEven the largest miners like RIOT platforms and Marathon would struggle to survive if a market downturn reduces their revenues further.\n\nIn April, the block rewards generated by Bitcoin miners will be slashed by 50% as part of the cryptocurrency\u2019s 4-year halving cycle. In the short term at least, that means revenues for companies like Marathon Digital and RIOT Platforms will drop off a cliff.\n\nDuring the previous 2 halving events in 2020 and 2016, the consolidation of hash power among larger, more efficient setups essentially wiped out small miners, leaving only industrial operations able to compete. Now, as the next reduction in BTC rewards approaches, even the biggest players may not be able to survive.\n\nIs Bitcoin Mining Profitable?\n\nThe primary concern for firms like Marathon and RIOT is that even before the halving, Bitcoin mining is generally only profitable when the market is up.\n\nTo survive, miners need cheap electricity, and the industry is concentrated in places where it has the support of local governments and energy providers.\n\nBitcoin mining will be profitable above $38k post halving. pic.twitter.com/3bIywsTwQR \u2014 Tom Dunleavy (@dunleavy89) January 12, 2024\n\nIn the US, for example, firms have flocked to Texas to take advantage of the state grid\u2019s dynamic pricing and supply model, which increasingly relies on facilities like RIOT\u2019s Rockdale mine to soak up excess electricity during periods of low demand.\n\nYet even with these incentives, 24 years after the company was founded, RIOT is only now on the cusp of breaking even. Meanwhile, Mararthon\u2019s path to profitability has been shorter, but volatile market conditions in the runup to April could still derail its progress.\n\nAmong publicly listed mining companies, many investors have reasoned that there are better-priced opportunities to be found among smaller firms with a value-to-sales ratio.\n\nRIOT \u201cOvervalued\u201d Claims Seeking Alpha\n\nIn a recent analysis, Seeking Alpha observed that \u201cBitcoin mining companies might not survive a 50% cut in Bitcoin mining revenue.\u201d Given the expected hit to their income from April onward, the report concluded that many miners are currently overvalued.\n\nSpecifically, it pointed to RIOT\u2019s current market capitalization of $2.12 billion, which has already fallen by around $900 million since peaking last year. In the coming months, the report predicted RIOT\u2019s stock market valuation falling even further, highlighting the $1 billion mark as a recommended entry point for investors.\n\nThe Next Core Scientific?\n\nSeeking Altha drew a comparison between RIOT and Core Scientific, which was once one one the biggest publicly traded mining companies, but went bust last year after a dramatic reversal of its fortunes during 2022\u2019s crypto winter.\n\nCore Scientific\u2019s decline serves as an important lesson for miners today. No company is too big to fail in a highly competitive industry, where razor-thin margins can easily be erased by market downturns .\n\nEven Marathon, which by most measures is the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin miner, could still struggle if the price of Bitcoin falls too low to support its operational costs.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings is gearing up for the #Bitcoin halving by optimizing its mining operations with low-cost renewable energy, diversified mining sites, and a vertically integrated tech stack from the mining pool to the ASIC. pic.twitter.com/EGRzx5QXNY \u2014 Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) (@MarathonDH) October 20, 2023\n\nIn the run-up to the halving, Marathon has been doubling down on efficiency, scaling its operations and cutting costs. Nonetheless, market analyst Pollock Mondol recently observed that the company\u2019s cost structure remains higher than many of its peers. Should Bitcoin prices dip below $30,000 post-halving, he concluded that Marathon\u2019s profit margins would be wiped out, putting its entire business model in jeopardy."

        "content": "Photo: Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThis was supposed to be bitcoin\u2019s comeback season. On January 11, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a new way (for the U.S., at least) to invest in the digital currency, bitcoin exchange-traded funds. BlackRock and Fidelity \u2014 collectively managing about $15 trillion \u2014 were among the 11 issuers who got the nod from the regulator to build a bitcoin-focused ETF fund, a popular and easy-to-use investment vehicle. These ETFs didn\u2019t change anything about the nature of bitcoin, its extreme volatility, or its lack of any real-world usefulness. But that didn\u2019t matter. This was something like bitcoin\u2019s big IPO \u2014 the moment the cryptocurrency really became investible for Wall Street. This had long been the digital-golden dream of the crypto set: the ability to make bitcoin available to everyday investors who knew and trusted ETFs and could now put it in a retirement account. Bitcoin to $1 million? Sure \u2014 why not?\n\nSince then, among very high expectations of \u201cnumber go up,\u201d bitcoin has been doing little else but fall \u2014 hard. By Tuesday, it had fallen 20 percent from its recent peak, officially entering a bear market. Some of this could be chalked up to hype, but money has mostly been flowing into these new bitcoin ETFs \u2014 more than $10 billion altogether. Flowing into all them, that is, except one: the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has been absolutely hemorrhaging money (and bitcoin) in the days since the ETFs began trading. The Grayscale Trust \u2014 a core part of the troubled Digital Currency Group \u2014 is one of the world\u2019s largest holders of bitcoin, about as well known and respected as you can get in crypto world (which, to be fair, is grading on a pretty steep curve).\n\nThere are some wonky reasons that could partly explain why so much money is fleeing Grayscale \u2014 differences in fees, the vagaries of tax payments \u2014 but there\u2019s one very big reason behind the collapse: convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nUpdate for the #Bitcoin ETF Cointucky Derby.\n\n\n\n$515 million came out of $GBTC yesterday for a total of $3.96 billion in outflows since converting to an ETF. Newborn 9 saw +$409 million flow in. Net outflows in total for yesterday were -$106 million. pic.twitter.com/gzymMHHua8 \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2024\n\nNo \u2014 Bankman-Fried is not trading bitcoin from jail, where he has apparently cornered the canned fish market. According to CoinDesk, what is left of FTX, Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto exchange, is selling off its assets in order to pay back people who have had their funds frozen on the defunct exchange for the past 14 months. When FTX collapsed in November 2022, that essentially froze about $3 billion worth of crypto that was being held on the exchange \u2014 including about $900 million worth of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Since then, FTX\u2019s new management has tapped Galaxy Digital, the hedge fund run by Mike Novogratz \u2014 the ex\u2013Goldman Sachs trader with an unfortunate crypto tattoo \u2014 to sell off the Grayscale funds to give depositors back at least some of their money. And it makes sense that Galaxy would pick a time of maximum excitement to start selling. Not only do FTX customers need to get paid back, but the bankruptcy lawyers managing the company have racked up hundreds of millions of dollars in fees.\n\nThe ripple effect is not just limited to Bankman-Fried\u2019s own companies, though. FTX was one of the more spectacular blowups of 2021, but it wasn\u2019t the only one \u2014 and many of those companies held onto shares of Grayscale. \u201cA lot of people were using it as collateral throughout 2021 \u2014 it was the widowmaker trade. It blew up Three Arrows Capital, BlockFi, Celsius,\u201d said James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg. Another victim: Grayscale\u2019s parent company. DCG\u2019s lending arm, Genesis, went under in the wake of FTX\u2019s collapse. That business was funded in large part by customers of the Winklevoss twins\u2019 exchange, Gemini, who are still waiting to get their funds back. \u201cDCG has a bunch of issues with Genesis in bankruptcy,\u201d Seyffart said. It\u2019s unclear how much DCG itself has been selling, he said, but it recently held as much as $1.4 billion in shares of the bitcoin trust.\n\nYou\u2019d think that in crypto, where prices crash and surge as part of the normal course of events, this would all be met with a shrug. Instead, crypto Twitter (the center of crypto universe) is fearing the worst \u2014 maybe even expecting Grayscale\u2019s demise. That would be yet another spectacular implosion in the crypto world, on the scale of the failures of FTX and Three Arrows in 2022. As The Wall Street Journal has pointed out, there are actually plenty of good reasons for someone to sell their Grayscale shares now, especially considering that they\u2019re more expensive than those of its competitor funds. Since the SEC approved the ETFs, Grayscale has lost about $500 million a day, almost every day, Seyffart said.\n\nAs the price of bitcoin continues to fall, it\u2019s going to make it only easier for Grayscale investors to sell, but it would have to lose the vast majority of its value before it went into an actual death spiral. With so much money going to Grayscale competitors, it\u2019s hard to believe that would happen any time soon \u2014 but then again, runs on crypto companies have happened before."

        "content": "Bitcoin is acting as a forward-looking barometer for traditional market health, notably within the banking system, according to Arthur Hayes.\n\nHayes predicts a market bottom of $30,000 to $35,000 for Bitcoin following the expiry of a little-known lending programme come March.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s decline following the launch of US spot exchange-traded funds is a signal of what\u2019s to come for US financial markets, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes wrote in a blog post on Wednesday.\n\nThe asset is down 6% this week to around the $40,000 mark after clawing back losses from Tuesday\u2019s trading session that saw it reach a low of $38,500.\n\nThat contrasts with fresh all-time highs for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 this week.\n\nReasons behind the move include Grayscale\u2019s nearly $4 billion in outflows as investors seek out lower fees elsewhere, shifting dynamics as the ETF offers new alternatives to bet on the crypto market.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nHayes challenges this narrative.\n\nAccording to him, this view overlooks the net inflow of funds into newly listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, which offsets the GBTC outflows.\n\nOn Tuesday, roughly $515 million was withdrawn from GBTC, adding to the $640 million taken out on Monday.\n\nSince January 12, the total amount withdrawn from GBTC has reached over $3.96 billion, DL News previously reported.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nOn Tuesday, the combined withdrawals from all 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs amounted to $106 million. It\u2019s believed these ETFs have collectively seen net inflows of around $983 million since launch.\n\nA strain on smaller banks?\n\nInstead, Hayes points to the uncertainty surrounding the renewal of the US Bank Term Funding Program as a key factor influencing Bitcoin.\n\nThe BTFP, a central bank initiative, plays a critical role in providing stability and liquidity to financial institutions, particularly during financial turmoil, by offering favourable loan terms for short-term funding.\n\nThe Federal Reserve this week said the funding programme, created in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last year, will end in March.\n\nUntil then, the Fed will also immediately raise the interest rate on new loans from the programme.\n\nHayes speculates that the non-renewal of this programme could place a strain on smaller banks, possibly leading the Fed to lower interest rates or resume quantitative easing.\n\nAs of December 31, the total outstanding amount of all advances under the BTFP was about $129 billion, according to the Fed.\n\nThe total value of the collateral pledged to secure those advances was about $194 billion, which includes credit protection to the reserve banks from the Department of the Treasury.\n\nWhile the Fed doesn\u2019t directly set these bond yields, its policies can influence them.\n\nHigher yields on government bonds can lead to an overall increase in borrowing costs, which can particularly impact smaller banks.\n\nThese banks may find it more expensive to borrow money, affecting their operations and financial health.\n\nThe hope is that if the Fed reduces interest rates, it might help in bringing down these bond yields to a more manageable level, ideally between 2% and 3%, easing the financial pressure on smaller banks, Hayes wrote.\n\nHe further suggests that the traditional market\u2019s record run may be giving a false sense of security to policymakers, adding further justification to end BTFP.\n\nHayes predicts, \u201cBitcoin is likely to dip before the BTFP renewal decision on March 12, potentially finding a local bottom between $30,000 and $35,000.\u201d\n\nAs for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100?\n\nHayes wrote they\u2019re likely to dump come March, with Bitcoin bouncing back following a Fed rate cut and more money being pumped into the economy.\n\nCrypto market movers\n\nBitcoin is down 0.31% in the last 24 hours as of 3pm GMT, trading at $39,953.\n\nEthereum fell 1.13% in the same period, now at $2,208.\n\nAvalanche and Solana are down 2% and up 1.08%, respectively.\n\nWhat we\u2019re reading\n\nTom Carreras is a markets correspondent at DL News.

It also allows for petitions for remission or mitigation, which would pardon some or all of the seized Bitcoin from the forfeiture.\n\nBTC belonged to Xanax seller and U.S. agent\n\nThe Bitcoin previously belonged two individuals. The first lot was seized from Ryan Farace, a Maryland man who along with his father was convicted of a money laundering conspiracy involving darknet market sales of Xanax, and from Sean Bridges, a former U.S. Secret Service Special Agent involved in Silk Road investigations who stole Bitcoin that the U.S. government had previously obtained. The second, smaller lot was seized solely from Bridges.\n\nThe two lots were seized on Feb. 10, 2021 in Memphis, Tennessee, and on May 11, 2021, in Arlington, Virginia, respectively. A District Court in Maryland previously condemned and forfeited the Bitcoin to the U.S. government on Jan. 8, 2024.\n\nThose funds make up just a small portion of Silk Road-related seizures that the U.S. government has made to date. In addition to early seizures from Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht circa 2013, the government seized $3.6 billion of Bitcoin from James Zhong in 2022 as well as $1 billion of Bitcoin circa 2020.\n\nAs of December 2023, the U.S. government held about $9 billion worth of Bitcoin, though this did not exclusively originate from Silk Road seizures."

        "title": "It\u2019s OK to Hate Bitcoin - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Bitcoin has fallen below $40,000 after rising to just under $50,000 before the spot bitcoin ETF launch. Many investors expected this to be the beginning of a price rally that would be extended later this year through the halving event and take us to prices seen in 2021. With excitement far below expected levels, bitcoin continues to be a divisive topic. But here is why it shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nBitcoin is divisive because many don\u2019t understand it.\n\nWhen bitcoin was created in 2009, it was launched in the post-financial crisis era as an alternative to mainstream finance. Combining this asset with a mainstream financial instrument like an ETF has been a challenge. For example, the SEC was reluctant on approval. Then, JP Morgan\u2019s CEO recently released negative comments on the cryptocurrency. Finally, Vanguard refused to let spot bitcoin ETFs trade on their platform.\n\nPossibly one of the biggest barriers is that mainstream financial analysts who are accustomed to analyzing stocks and bonds don\u2019t understand the cryptocurrency. It is more difficult to predict its prices and volumes, but arguably stocks can have and do have all the same risks. While earnings and EBITDA are based on some level of fact, multiples are an art, and stock prices are a best guess. Bitcoin has also been associated with bad actors, but the stock market hasn\u2019t been immune from that issue (e.g., Theranos, Enron, etc.). Still, it has been given a bad reputation when many of the same issues exist for other disruptive technologies.\n\nIts prices are more rational, which also means they are less exciting.\n\nA couple of years ago, we wanted the bitcoin ecosystem to mature and we wanted prices to behave rationally. It was known for its volatility and that\u2019s why it was seen as unfit for many investors. Now that they\u2019re showing some rational behavior, it seems like the hype has died down. And many are no longer interested. After months of anticipation starting with Grayscale\u2019s court win, the ether futures launch, and the SEC X hack, most of the excitement from the spot bitcoin ETF launch was already priced in. I think that explains the lack of price movement. Additionally, investors who had been waiting for prices to recover may have sold their bitcoin holdings on the brief rally near the ETF launch. And lastly, many investors are exiting Grayscale ($4.0 billion of outflows\u2014discussed more below), which has added to that price pressure (another rational event).\n\nDespite bitcoin prices falling, the launch was still significant for both crypto and ETFs.\n\nDespite the lack of price movement, spot bitcoin ETFs were still a milestone in the crypto industry. It helped legitimize it and brought it to the mainstream. It was also a milestone in the ETF industry by setting a precedent similar to the gold ETF launch.\n\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw $1.9 billion in flows, while the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) earned a close $1.6 billion. There is a large gap between these products and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), which have around $500 million in inflows. A fee war drove fees down to 0.0% before launch. In turn, investors turned to big names that can provide the liquidity needed for institutional investors and the name recognition needed for new retail investors who are hesitant about investing in an emerging asset class. Together, the nine new spot bitcoin ETFs had $5.0 billion in net inflows this month. Meanwhile, Grayscale saw $4.0 billion of net outflows ($2.8 billion in the past week).\n\nIt seems that Grayscale had somewhat of a first-mover advantage with assets and experience. But its fee stands out sorely among its peers with its 1.5% expense ratio. We have to give Grayscale credit. If it were not for Grayscale\u2019s victory in court over the SEC, spot bitcoin ETFs would probably not have been approved yet. Or maybe even ever. While they were a key player in this fight, investors logically may be moving to cheaper products. Many large institutional investors also exited Grayscale including ARK in December. ARK then invested those assets in their own spot bitcoin ETFs and FTX\u2019s estate.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs have played a large role in making crypto a more legitimate asset class. Flows ex-GBTC show that investors are interested in these products. But I expect not everyone will be a fan of Bitcoin. And that\u2019s okay.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin surpassed $42,000 on Jan. 26 amidst significant spot Bitcoin ETF flows and an upgrade to Coinbase\u2019s stock rating.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was valued at $42,040.36 with a market cap of $824.4 billion at 8:05 pm UTC on Friday. That marks 5.3% growth over 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s current price also represents a five-day high, as prices were close to $40,000 on Jan. 24 and 25 and as low as $38,678 on Jan. 23\n\nThe cryptocurrency market in its entirety was up 4.6% over 24 hours. Other top ten assets saw comparable price gains today: Avalanche (AVAX) was up 7.3%, Solana (SOL) was up 5.9%, XRP was up 3.7%, BNB was up 3.5%, Cardano (ADA) was up 3.3%, and Ethereum (ETH) was up 1.9%.\n\nThe market saw $116 million in liquidations over 24 hours, according to Coinglass data, with Bitcoin (BTC) accounting for $43.23 million of liquidations and Ethereum (ETH) accounting for $23.52 million of liquidations.\n\nGains may be due to ETF flows, Coinbase rating\n\nThough it is not entirely known why Bitcoin has gained value today, spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and outflows are one major influence on the market.\n\nOutflows from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC ETF are now slowing and may have largely concluded, according to a report from JP Morgan on Jan. 25. High GBTC outflows put more Bitcoin (BTC) onto the market, providing a larger supply in comparison to investor demand. Such outflows likely contributed to falling Bitcoin prices in the weeks following various spot Bitcoin ETF approvals on Jan. 10.\n\nConversely, inflows into other funds have taken Bitcoin off the market and may be helping to raise prices. Although most spot Bitcoin ETFs have positive inflows, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) notably crossed $2 billion in total inflows on Jan. 26. Net inflows for all spot Bitcoin ETFs amount to $744 million.\n\nOther positive developments may have influenced crypto prices as well. Yahoo! Finance analysts noted that Coinbase (COIN)\u2019s stock rating has been upgraded by Oppenheimer & Co. The price of COIN is also up 3.40% today.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "title": "Why BlackRock Bitcoin holdings increased as prices dropped - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The Newborn Nine spot Bitcoin ETFs recently launched in the US have seen their combined assets under management explode to $5.1 billion in the nine trading days since their launch. However, throughout this period, the price of Bitcoin has fallen roughly 20%. The share prices for these ETFs have also fallen in line with Bitcoin. So, how do the ETFs continue to purchase more Bitcoin if the value of their shares is in decline?\n\nCommodity-shares ETFs are designed to represent exposure to the underlying asset. In the case of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the underlying asset is, of course, Bitcoin. When money flows into the funds, it is used to purchase Bitcoin at an equivalent rate. As demand increases, so does the value of the ETF shares. The value of the shares relative to the value of the underlying Bitcoin is called the \u2018net asset value\u2019 (NAV), and this is used as a barometer to assess whether the fund is over or undervalued relative to the Bitcoin it holds.\n\nCreation of ETF share baskets.\n\nNew shares in the ETFs are not created out of thin air when an investor decides to buy in. Instead, they are created in baskets by Authorized Participants (APs). BlackRock, for example, currently retains ABN AMRO Clearing, Jane Street Capital, JP Morgan Securities, Macquarie Capital, and Virtu Americas as APs for the iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nFor BlackRock, these five companies are the only entities able to create or redeem baskets of shares relative to the ETF. Baskets are groups of 40,000 shares, with each valued at around $906,365 as of press time. Each basket is equivalent to around 22.7 BTC, meaning whenever shares are created for the ETF, at least 22.7 BTC (1 basket) must be bought. When shares are redeemed, at least the same amount is sold for cash to give to APs. Under the current mechanisms, only cash can be used to create share baskets, meaning APs cannot give BlackRock Bitcoin in return for shares.\n\nTo meet liquidity needs, APs will often buy baskets of shares ahead of time to sell to the market. This process happens once per trading day and uses the CF Benchmarks Index rate for Bitcoin (New York variant) to ensure shares are issued relative to the price of Bitcoin. When the trading activity for an ETF is high, it means there\u2019s a high demand for shares, and thus, there needs to be sufficient liquidity to handle the volume. Baskets of shares will be created in line with the volume, and these new shares will be used to report inflows into the ETFs.\n\nFor instance, if 7 million new shares are created, bringing the total outstanding shares to 70 million, and the NAV price for the ETF is $22, the AUM increases by $154 million to $1.54 billion. However, these shares have not necessarily been sold into the open market and in the hands of investors. The newly created shares may still be held by the APs, ready to be used as liquidity for the trading activity ahead.\n\nIf Bitcoin\u2019s price declines, which leads to investors selling shares in the ETF, the assets under management do not necessarily decline at the same rate. While the AUM may reduce in dollar terms if Bitcoin becomes less valuable, the number of BTC held in the fund remains unchanged until the AP redeems shares.\n\nAuthorized Participants proxy investment in Bitcoin\n\nA reduction in ETF share price while its AUM increases due to additional Bitcoin purchases, therefore, could signal that the APs believe the underlying asset is undervalued. APs can hold onto outstanding shares without redeeming them if they believe Bitcoin will be worth more in the future. Each share is priced relative to the AUM when valued in dollar terms. Therefore, by not redeeming the shares if Bitcoin rallies in the future, the AUM will also increase, making each share more valuable.\n\nTherefore, given that both the Newborn Nine and the underlying Bitcoin have declined around 18% since launch. At the same time, the combined assets under management have grown by approximately $550 million per day, and it seems the APs are not redeeming shares.\n\nThe only ETF seeing outflows in terms of redemptions is Grayscale, with its imposing 1.5% fee and majority of investors in profit. All other ETFs, namely the Newborn Nine, are experiencing daily inflows via new share basket creations from APs.\n\nThere is around $1.5 billion in trading volume across the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which requires considerable liquidity to facilitate. Should this liquidity fall off, we may see some redemption activity.\n\nUntil then, the combined value of cash used by US institutions to facilitate share creation for Bitcoin ETFs is over $27 billion. Given that the price has declined while new share baskets have been created, it is reasonable to assume that some of this Bitcoin is essentially owned by APs such as JP Morgan and Jane Street Capital, among others.\n\nNow for the slightly \u2018tin foil hat,\u2019 full Bitcoin maxi part of the argument. If JP Morgan as a company were as bearish on Bitcoin as CEO Jamie Dimon, one might expect baskets to be redeemed as long as enough shares exist in the market to handle liquidity. Yet, from current data, it seems no share baskets have been redeemed for the Newborn Nine. Any shares that may currently be unallocated to investors belong to the APs who created the baskets.\n\nBitcoin ETFs highly liquid and actively traded.\n\nFor BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), 11.9 million shares changed hands on Jan. 24, with 77.2 million shares outstanding. This calculates to around a 15% liquidity rate.\n\nIn comparison, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) has 854 million shares and an average volume of around 5.5 million, indicating a volume of 0.6% of the float. For IBIT, this equated to roughly $270 million in volume, while IVV saw around ten times more at $2.7 billion. Thus, IVV has 10 times the volume, but IBIT has 25 times the liquidity.\n\nThe high liquidity for Bitcoin ETFs indicates strong, albeit potentially more speculative, interest in the financial products. IVV\u2019s lower trading ratio indicates its stable position in the market, with far less speculative trading. However, the Bitcoin ETF may also be less sensitive to large trades, given the deep liquidity available.\n\nBy all accounts, the debut of spot Bitcoin on Wall Street has been an enormous success. The interest from investors is evident through the volume, and the institutional interest and belief can be seen clearly in the strong basket creation across the board.\n\nI\u2019d even hazard to guess that if volumes decline, we will continue to see daily inflows into the Newborn Nine ETFs as long as Grayscale continues its outflows. Given how the Bitcoin price is calculated for ETFs, buying Bitcoin from Grayscale is an excellent method of averaging dollar cost into Bitcoin. This is especially true when, on paper, APs are giving cash to the world\u2019s leading asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity rather than custodying Bitcoin themselves. Further, there is no public exposure to this method of Bitcoin accumulation, meaning that the reputational risk is low.\n\nUnfortunately, unlike blockchain, TradFi is a closed book. There is no way to know how many outstanding shares are held with APs and how many are in investors\u2019 hands. Future disclosures and reports may give snapshots of the situation, yet we are left mainly in the dark until TradFi adopts a more transparent blockchain-based infrastructure.\n\nIs JP Morgan using BlackRock to buy Bitcoin behind closed doors?\n\nThe answer is maybe. To address whether institutions such as JP Morgan and other APs could be using ETFs like BlackRock\u2019s as a proxy to buy Bitcoin, I\u2019ll end with this line from BlackRock\u2019s prospectus;\n\n\u201d An Authorized Participant is under no obligation to create or redeem Baskets, and an Authorized Participant is under no obligation to offer to the public Shares of any Baskets it does create.\u201c\n\nThis is, of course, the standard language for such a document, but it does make you wonder. This flexibility could be significant. It implies that these institutions have the freedom to manage their involvement in the ETF in a way that aligns with their investment strategies, including how they want to expose themselves to Bitcoin.\n\nSo, if an institution believes that Bitcoin\u2019s value will increase, it might create baskets to get more shares (and hence, more exposure to Bitcoin) without necessarily selling those shares to the public. On the other hand, if they\u2019re less optimistic or want to reduce their exposure, they might choose not to create baskets.\n\nThis kind of strategy could be one way for institutions to indirectly invest in Bitcoin, using the ETF as a tool to manage their investment without directly buying or selling Bitcoin itself.\n\nUPDATE: Clarified iShares Core S&P 500 ticker.\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Bitcoin has fallen since the approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. (Travelstoxphoto via Getty Images)\n\nOver one-third of participants in a Deutsche Bank survey expect the bitcoin price to drop below $20,000. The recent poll also revealed that a majority of respondents expressed concerns about a potential cryptocurrency collapse.\n\n\"We conducted a survey among 2,000 consumers in the US, the UK, and Europe, and despite bitcoin prices hovering above $40,000 for several weeks now, over one-third of our respondents still hold the belief that bitcoin prices will dip below $20,000 by the end of this year,\" said the research analysts who compiled the survey.\n\nThe analysts said that survey participants had a high level of uncertainty when considering bitcoin's long-term prospects. \"39% of participants believe that it will bitcoin will remain in existence in the coming years, while 42% anticipate its disappearance,\" the analysts added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: Crypto live prices\n\nAn analysis of the survey results revealed a significant lack of understanding among participants regarding cryptocurrencies in general. \"Two-thirds of consumers possess minimal or no understanding of these digital assets,\" the analysts said.\n\nThe research also found that more than half of the respondents expressed concerns about a major cryptocurrency experiencing a collapse within the next two years. \"This sentiment may be attributable to past events, such as the collapse of FTX in 2022, as well as recent instances of depegging among stablecoins like the collapse of TerraUSD, and the depegging of TrueUSD on January 18,\" added the authors of the Deutsche Bank survey, which was conducted from the 15th to the 19th of January.\n\nBitcoin price volatility increases\n\nBitcoin's price has fallen by over 6% in the past week. The recent price fluctuations of the digital asset have resulted in substantial liquidations of leveraged BTC positions, following the approval of multiple spot ETF filings by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, January 10.\n\nStory continues\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF is a financial product that investors hope will open the gateway for mainstream capital to flood the crypto market.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF boom won't mimic previous rallies, says VC founder\n\nIn the past 24 hours, the digital asset has experienced large price swings that caused almost $23m in liquidations of leveraged bitcoin positions on cryptocurrency exchanges, according to Coinglass data. Of these liquidations, the majority, over $12m, consisted of short positions.\n\nAccording to CoinGlass data, the overall crypto market witnessed the liquidation of over $80m in leveraged positions in the past 24 hours. Liquidations tend to occur during volatile price swings, when prices rise or fall sharply. During these market conditions, there is either a rush to buy or sell.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin rally stokes $50k speculation over spot ETF anticipation\n\nFor most of the past week the price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) has traded below the $41,000 mark. The price of the largest digital asset by market capitalisation, as of the time of writing, is $40,167, according to Coingecko data.\n\nAccording to data from Coingecko, the global cryptocurrency market cap today is $1.64tn, a slight 0.7% decrease in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe market cap of bitcoin is at $787bn, with the world's largest digital asset holding a 48.1% dominance over the rest of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nWatch: Turning real assets into tokens on blockchain has $15 trillion market potential | Future Focus\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price has risen over 4% in the past 24 hours, buoying the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nThis price increase has led some investors to speculate that Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX), the presale Stake-to-Mine project, could ride Bitcoin\u2019s coattails as it gears up for exchange listings soon.\n\nBitcoin Breaks Crucial $40k Barrier Amid Growing Bullishness\n\nBitcoin is moving again, with the world\u2019s top cryptocurrency pushing past the crucial $40,000 resistance level.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $41,050, the same level it was on Monday.\n\nThis latest surge has allowed Bitcoin to move past its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) on the 4-hour chart, which could signal growing momentum behind the rally.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin has established strong support around $38,500 over the past few days, giving bulls confidence that any dips could find eager buyers.\n\nThis return of positive sentiment is also evident in Bitcoin\u2019s trading volumes, which are up 14% across major spot exchanges in the last day.\n\nThe Crypto Fear & Greed Index has also seen a slight uptick to 49, although it remains stuck in \u201cNeutral\u201d territory.\n\nIf Bitcoin can continue building on these technical milestones and growing trading volumes, its price could be poised to challenge resistance around $43,500.\n\nGBTC Outflows Slowing While Planned BTC Sale Seen as Minor\n\nTwo recent developments suggest growing bullishness around Bitcoin\u2019s price prospects.\n\nFirst, analysts from JPMorgan believe the majority of selling pressure from Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust is likely complete.\n\nThe fund has seen over $4 billion in outflows since converting to a spot ETF on January 11, putting downward pressure on Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, with competition from BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s spot ETFs, additional selloffs from GBTC seem unlikely.\n\nSecondly, the US government\u2019s planned sale of nearly $130 million worth of seized Silk Road Bitcoins has been viewed as relatively small \u2013 less than 2% of the estimated 194,000 BTC the government currently holds.\n\nWith the planned sale just a drop in the bucket, the coast looks clear for Bitcoin to continue pushing higher if positive momentum builds.\n\nProminent crypto analyst CryptoMocro on Twitter even said we are now in a \u201cbull run\u201d and will \u201cprint a lot more.\u201d\n\nInnovative Bitcoin Minetrix Poised to Ride Potential Bitcoin Bull Run\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s price action has been grabbing headlines, new crypto projects like Bitcoin Minetrix stand to capitalize on any renewed retail interest in the space.\n\nThis fresh project offers a unique Stake-to-Mine structure whereby BTCMTX holders can stake their tokens to earn cloud mining credits.\n\nThese cloud mining credits can then be burned to obtain hash power for mining Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Minetrix seeks to tap into the booming cloud mining industry, allowing BTCMTX holders to passively earn BTC without needing expensive equipment.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin Minetrix offers its own native staking protocol with up to 70% APY.\n\nAs Bitcoin regains momentum, previously cautious retail investors may flock back to the crypto market \u2013 and to innovative new altcoins like BTCMTX.\n\nThe project has already raised over $9.4 million in its ongoing presale, offering BTCMTX tokens for $0.0131.\n\nWith sights set on exchange listings and a mobile app down the line, Bitcoin Minetrix seems primed to ride any bullish momentum coming from Bitcoin.\n\nIf Bitcoin resumes its push back to local highs (and potentially beyond), BTCMTX could indirectly benefit.\n\nFor this reason, investors have been clamoring to get involved in the Bitcoin Minetrix presale and join the project\u2019s Telegram channel to stay on top of any vital updates.\n\nVisit Bitcoin Minetrix Presale\n\nDisclaimer: The above article is sponsored content; it\u2019s written by a third party.

        "content": "Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood doubled down on her views about the importance of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) this week. In a video interview with CNBC on Tuesday, she discussed the introduction of 11 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Bitcoin's real-time spot price. The new funds have lost some value in the early going, but she said she expected as much.\n\nWood's words on Bitcoin\n\n\"This hasn't disturbed our point of view at all,\" Wood told CNBC. \"We think this is one of the most important investments of our lifetimes. This is a global, rules-based monetary system. It's a very big idea, and we think it's the biggest of all the crypto ideas out there.\"\n\nCathie Wood's Bitcoin engagement isn't new. She has been pounding the table about the largest and oldest cryptocurrency for years, suggesting lofty price targets such as $1.48 million per coin by the year 2030. Ark Invest's funds don't hold Bitcoin directly, relying on indirect investments such as mutual funds and crypto-oriented stocks instead.\n\nWood's diversified growth-stock funds have not rushed to invest in the new Bitcoin ETFs, but her team manages one of the 11 new names. The Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKB) is one of the larger funds early on, with $481 million of Bitcoin assets under management so far.\n\nWhat's the big deal with Bitcoin ETFs?\n\nThe establishment of these ETFs is a significant milestone in the integration of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system. Spot-price ETFs add a layer of regulatory and fund-management safety to the cryptocurrency, giving many individual and institutional investors a more comfortable on-ramp to the crypto sector.\n\nWood's commitment to Bitcoin through the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF indicates a firm belief in its future value, and she restated her long-term expectations of a million-dollar Bitcoin future. In other recent updates, she pointed out potential catalysts such as the upcoming halving of Bitcoin mining rewards and favorable trading patterns in recent months. It remains to be seen how quickly Bitcoin can reach Wood's soaring price targets, but the potential for continued growth in the digital economy is quite inspiring.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF wasn't one of them.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency rally of 2023, which extended into this year, has somewhat come to a halt. Bitcoin (BTC) particularly has taken a hit over the past two weeks, or since Jan 10, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe approval was anticipated and the decision added further fuel to the Bitcoin rally that saw it surpass the $49,000 mark. However, the price has been on a decline since then. The market fell more than 18% over the weekend and on Jan 24, Bitcoin hovered around $40,000, a new year-to-date low.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval adds a new dimension to Bitcoin trading now. It is expected to boost the overall cryptocurrency market as it will now allow retail investors to trade Bitcoin without actually owning it. However, the rally has stalled.\n\nUnderstandably, Bitcoin has entered correction territory after the ETF approval. Experts see immense potential in Bitcoin, and the launch of an ETF is expected to contribute to the long-term growth of the market.\n\nPart of the recent selling pressure on Bitcoin has been linked to sales from the FTX bankruptcy estate. The estate has reportedly sold approximately 22 million shares of Grayscale's GBTC in the past few weeks, contributing to the downward pressure on the cryptocurrency, according to a CoinDesk report.\n\nAlso, several experts believe the fluctuations in Bitcoin's price to selling by Bitcoin holders, specifically short-term traders and large holders, who decided to cash in on profits following the surge in prices last year. They believe that the approval of the ETF might be seen as a \"sell-the-news\" event.\n\nNevertheless, the current correction phase is viewed as temporary, and the recent approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month is expected to have a positive impact on the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nStocks in Focus\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence, and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 268.6%.

        "title": "Beyond Bitcoin: Unlocking Blockchain's Potential - American Enterprise Institute",
        "content": "Blockchain technology has the potential to transform financial services, supply chains, and efficiency. Yet as innovators like Digital Assets seek to modernize infrastructure across industries, questions emerge around balancing efficiency, privacy, and regulatory needs in complex blockchain applications.\n\nTo unpack some of these key questions around blockchain, privacy, and regulation, I spoke with Yuval Rooz. Rooz is the cofounder and CEO of Digital Asset, a blockchain technology company that works to modernize the industry underlying today\u2019s economy \u2013 enabling companies to better balance efficiency with privacy.\n\nBelow is a lightly edited and abridged transcript of our discussion. You can listen to this and other episodes of Explain to Shane on AEI.org and subscribe via your preferred listening platform. If you enjoyed this episode, leave us a review, and tell your friends and colleagues to tune in.\n\nShane Tews: You are doing a lot in the market to modernize the financial infrastructure around blockchain, so start us off with some basics about your company, Digital Assets.\n\nYuval Rooz: At Digital Assets, we\u2019re using blockchain technology and smart contracts to bring the financial infrastructure to the 21st century. We can talk in more detail about what that means, but really, there\u2019s quite a lot of inefficiency that exists in today\u2019s infrastructure due to a lot of reconciliation and this hub and spoke model that traditionally is how enterprise software was built. We\u2019re trying to bring standardization\u2014which is where you use smart contracts\u2014and one source of truth\u2014which is where blockchain comes in\u2014to remove a lot of these inefficiencies.\n\nOne of the things that people don\u2019t always understand in the smart contract language is the ability to utilize it for both privacy as well as efficiency. There\u2019s sometimes a misconception that everything on blockchain is wide open, but you have said that you can only share the information that is needed for a transaction. Is that right?\n\nSpot on. When you think about public chains like Bitcoin or Ethereum, their architecture was created in a way that everybody gets to see every transaction. So there is no privacy. When we started Digital Assets, we were not trying to recreate Bitcoin or Ethereum, but use some of the ideas behind blockchain to build regulated financial infrastructure. That one element that I just said about everybody seeing every transaction and having no privacy, was not possible for us to have if we wanted to work with regulated financial institutions.\n\nWhen we were designing these smart contracts and our infrastructure, we were not just saying, what is the transaction, but explicitly defining the parties that are part of that transaction. Meaning, who are the eligible parties that can see this transaction and who are the parties that are eligible to interact with this transaction?\n\nI\u2019ll give a very simple example. Imagine, Shane, you and I are moving money from one to another. Both you and I can decide how much money we want to move. But, we also know that there are Know Your Customer and Anti Money Laundering requirements. If a money transfer happens over $10,000, that needs to be reported to the authorities. In a smart contract, we can define that Shane and Yuval are parties to a transaction where they can define how much money they will move. But imagine there is another party, like a regulator, and if the transaction is above $10,000, that regulator gets to see the transaction. They suddenly have visibility into the transaction because it triggered an anti-money laundering rule. They cannot define how much money gets moved, they can\u2019t touch the money, but they have visibility. So, when we built the technology, we wanted to have this fine-grained control over the privacy of a transaction, who gets to interact with it, but also who gets to see it.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of discussion in Congress about stablecoin, though there are friction points in the space including places where regulators are regulating from the analog rulebook. So, where are you seeing this have a quick uptick in adoption?\n\nPeople are compiling all aspects of blockchain technology into a narrative of these bad actors that are deceiving investors and creating these assets that terrorist organizations and criminals are using to move value. In reality, we at Digital Assets are just using the underlying technology to manage real-world assets in a much more efficient manner.\n\nWhen you look at how financial institutions are being regulated, the regulations have no context to technology in the rules that they have to follow. Meaning, that a financial institution needs to satisfy all kinds of conditions, independent of the technology that they\u2019re using. For example, if you are a bank, you need to make sure that your customer information is confidential. It doesn\u2019t matter if the bank is using a MongoDB database if they\u2019re using a SQL database, if it\u2019s on-prem, if it\u2019s on the internet, is it in the cloud. It doesn\u2019t really matter. At a high level, it says if you are a bank, you need to protect your customers\u2019 information.\n\nThis is where the world starts to conflate ideas. People will say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re using blockchain. Well, how can you protect someone\u2019s information because everything is public? There\u2019s no privacy.\u201d Because of this idea, if you\u2019re using blockchain in the description of your projects, you now need to get approval from a regulator. That stifled a lot of innovation that had nothing to do with cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe technology is proving itself and it is getting used. For example, we have mortgages that are being issued on a blockchain and getting acquired in a much more efficient manner. Historically, it would take about a month to settle a mortgaged purchase. Now it\u2019s being done in hours. And many other use cases have nothing to do with cryptocurrencies, that are using that blockchain technology. The challenge is that when you go to launch these applications, it ends up being much longer than if we were to just use a traditional database in the cloud since our customers are heavily regulated because the word blockchain shows up. That\u2019s the unfortunate part of this connection to cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn another episode of this podcast, I had a guest who owned a chain of car dealerships and he realized the amount of friction there was in the chain of custody from all the different parts of selling a car, then owning a car, and then selling a car again. He went to the Ohio banks said, \u201cDo you know how much real estate you\u2019re spending keeping paper on these car loans?\u201d They slowly migrated their process, and saved billions of dollars just by getting rid of the warehouses that were maintaining the records of the information on cars.\n\nThat reflects a concept I\u2019m 100 percent behind, which is the tokenization of real-world assets. We don\u2019t need to create these made-up assets for a store of value. Think of gold: you don\u2019t have different versions or gold; like gold one, gold two, gold three, gold 10,000. So, this idea of tokenization of real-world assets is really where the value is. Which is, can we use this technology to streamline the processing and movement of value as close as possible to real time of real-world assets.\n\nIf done correctly, tokenization is really taking digitization to the next level. I think that people dislike digitization because digitization is a term that has been used for the last 15 or 20 years, so people wanted a cool new term. I think the problem with that is that it insinuates that if I represented an asset as a token, I solved all the problems. That\u2019s just not true. You really have to digitize the process: all of the transfer rules, and all of the components of the life of an asset. I think that that is the big potential around this technology.\n\nDo you think the US needs to lead? What if somebody else takes charge and gets ahead of us?\n\nI think the US needs to be involved in the conversation. I think that that\u2019s more important. A lot of times, people will bring up the point of China, but at the end of the day, the Yuan is not going to become the reserve currency because it\u2019s on a blockchain. It might not be a component of why countries will consider doing trade with China, because maybe it\u2019s easier, it\u2019s more efficient. But in my opinion, it\u2019s not going to be the primary reason. I think the absence of the US from the conversations around standards is much more damaging than the lack of actually implementing the technology.\n\nRight now, most developed countries are thinking about, what does this technology mean? What is the value of it? We\u2019re still many years away from developed countries moving all of their payment solutions to this technology, but the US should be at the forefront of those conversations."

        "title": "Peter Schiff Says Bitcoin (BTC) Price Might Explode to $10 Million if This Happens - CryptoPotato",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nPeter Schiff, a critic of Bitcoin, concedes its price could surge in the event of an extreme US dollar crisis.\n\nDespite his long-standing bearish stance on BTC, the cryptocurrency has continued to grow in value.\n\nA Bullish Prediction at Last?\n\nThe well-known economist and one of Bitcoin\u2019s harshest critics \u2013 Peter Schiff \u2013 touched upon the primary cryptocurrency again, claiming that its supporters would praise it even in the case of a severe crash:\n\n\u201cNo matter how low the price of Bitcoin falls, its proponents will always be able to claim it\u2019s outperformed gold. For example, even if Bitcoin falls to $100 in 2031 and gold rises to $10,000, they will claim that Bitcoin is up 100x in the past 20 years, while gold is only up 5x.\u201d\n\nHowever, BTC could also rally in the following years, with one X (Twitter) user provoking Schiff with a $10 million forecast by 2031.\n\nInterestingly, the economist claimed this could become a fact should the US dollar experience the same collapse as the German Papiermark approximately 100 years ago.\n\nThe hyperinflation in Germany between 1921 and 1923 is among the most dramatic financial crises in modern history. Back then, the country struggled with numerous economic challenges following the heavy war debts after World War I, so it started printing more money to meet its obligations.\n\nThe process led to a devaluation of the national currency, which plummeted at an unprecedented rate. At one point, one US dollar was worth 4,210,500,000,000 German Papiermarks, with people carrying wheelbarrows full of money to buy basic goods.\n\nSchiff\u2019s Previous Bearish Statements\n\nThe economist\u2019s harsh stance toward Bitcoin dates back to the early years of the cryptocurrency. In 2013, he opposed the theory that BTC resembles gold, arguing it is more like a \u201ctulip mania 2.0.\u201d\n\nHe also called the asset \u201ca digital pyramid scheme\u201d and forecasted its doom numerous times. In January 2023, he counseled HODLers to use BTC\u2019s rally as an opportunity to cash out. Nonetheless, the price kept advancing, being 120% up since that advice.\n\nMost recently, Schiff gave his two cents on the approved spot BTC ETFs in the USA, arguing that Gary Gensler (Chairman of the SEC) was \u201cbacked into a corner\u201d to give the thumbs up. As such, he expects the agency to implement \u201conerous crypto regulations\u201d that could negatively impact the industry and Bitcoin\u2019s value."

        "content": "BlackRock's Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) reached $2 billion in assets under management (AUM) on Jan. 26, just two weeks after it debuted on the Nasdaq.\n\nAccording to data released by Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price performance intraday has pushed the fund\u2019s market capitalization to $2.11 billion. The cryptocurrency\u2019s price has broken through $42,000 for the first time in nearly seven days after a sell-off following the launch of ETFs on Jan. 11.\n\n\u201cAssets under management\u201d is a term used to describe the total market value of all the financial assets held by a fund on behalf of its clients. This means that BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is leading in the race for investors\u2019 capital, just ahead of Fidelity\u2019s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $1.8 billion in flows over the previous 10 days.\n\nBlackRock is leveraging its market reputation as the world\u2019s largest asset manager to attract broader audiences to its crypto-based product.\n\nUnlike asset managers such as VanEck, which targeted early adopters and the crypto community with Bitcoin ETF television ads, BlackRock chose to communicate to baby boomers with a two-minute video featuring one of its executives outlining Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition and how investors can receive exposure to its new ETF.\n\nThe annual fees charged by issuers may also be contributing to capital attraction. BlackRock set its fee for the iShare ETF at 0.12% for the first 12 months or until the first $5 billion in assets under management, then plans to increase it to 0.25%.\n\nSeveral other issuers offer competitive fees as well, with ARK Invest charging 0.21%, VanEck listing a fee of 0.25%, and Bitwise charging 0.20%. Fees on ETFs are not billed directly to investors but rather deducted from the ETF\u2019s performance, which reduces investors\u2019 return.\n\nSeyffart anticipates Bitcoin ETFs to gather $10 billion in capital over the first year.\n\nMagazine: Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable?

        "content": "Swan, a bitcoin-focused financial services company, announced Thursday that it has been building out a bitcoin mining arm since the summer of 2023. Swan also said it is eyeing a Series C, and is hoping to become publicly traded within the next year.\n\nSwan Mining will run under Swan Institutional, a recently-announced division that also plans to offer bitcoin-backed lending, advisor services, asset management, private equity and a bitcoin trust company.\n\nThe announcement comes at a turbulent moment for bitcoin mining companies. Mining stocks broadly surged in anticipation of spot bitcoin ETF approval but have fallen since. Valkyrie\u2019s Bitcoin Miners ETF is down nearly 33% in 2024. Core Scientific recently managed to emerge from the bankruptcy it entered in December 2022 but saw its price plummet after being re-listed on the Nasdaq.\n\nAmong the major tailwinds for miners is the upcoming bitcoin halving, when rewards earned for mining will be cut in half.\n\nRead more: JPMorgan predicts bitcoin mining stock cooldown: CoinDesk\n\nSwan said in late 2023 it was generating $125 million in annualized revenue. CEO Cory Klippsten told Blockworks in an interview that at that time \u2014 as well as now \u2014 mining was Swan\u2019s biggest source of top-line revenue.\n\nKlippsten said the firm\u2019s goal is to have half of its mining rigs in the US and half abroad, but declined to disclose where most of its rigs are currently.\n\nIn a press release, Swan said that its miners were capable of producing 4.5 exahashes per second (EH/s). It hopes to raise that figure to eight EH/s by March.\n\nFor context, mining giant Marathon Digital said its hash rate reached 23.1 EH/s in November. Swan is more on par with Australian mining firm Iris Energy, which currently boasts six EH/s. At time of publication, the global bitcoin hashrate is roughly 532 EH/s, according to the hashrate tracker on CoinWarz. By the numbers, Swan contributes a little under 1% of all bitcoin mining power.\n\nSwan is looking to raise a Series C. Klippsten said the target amount for the raise is in flux, though he cited the company\u2019s previous mention of $150 million.\n\nKlippsten said Swan\u2019s bitcoin lending service should launch in February. The firm also plans to go public in the next year following a \u201cton of work with auditors and lawyers and bankers.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "$SOV Positioned to Capture Share in the $56 Billion DeFi Economy\n\nLONDON, UK, Jan. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sovryn, the leading Bitcoin DeFi dApp, proudly announces the launch of BitcoinOS, a groundbreaking 'superchain' of Bitcoin rollups. This innovative technology aims to vastly expand Bitcoin's network effects by fostering a substantial shared economy of token and asset trading directly on Bitcoin's robust and secure framework, competing directly with Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an age where Bitcoin's advancements seemed to plateau in contrast to other blockchains' rapid developments in smart contracts and scaling solutions, Sovryn introduces BitcoinOS. This solution elegantly addresses the dilemma between preserving Bitcoin's reliability and decentralization and the imperative for technological evolution. BitcoinOS offers developers new, modular layers for Bitcoin, enhancing functionality without altering the core blockchain.\n\nSovryn: At the Forefront of Bitcoin DeFi\n\nWith an impressive record of over $2 billion in trades, Sovryn has cemented its status as a leader in Bitcoin DeFi. BitcoinOS is set to resolve any limitations posed by Rootstock's sidechain technology, paving the way for a more expansive and interconnected ecosystem. This development is not just a leap forward for Sovryn but a monumental stride for the entire crypto industry, offering developers an unprecedented chance to create and innovate directly on Bitcoin, the world's most secure blockchain.\n\nMany projects have realized the massive untapped potential of smart contracts on Bitcoin. There are already over a dozen competing Bitcoin L2 projects, and new projects are regularly being announced. This represents a game-changing trend for Bitcoin, which up until now has had difficulty scaling and enabling smart contract systems.\n\nThe Dawn of a New Era: BitcoinOS Rollout\n\nDespite the burgeoning landscape of Bitcoin rollup projects, common challenges persist, notably the reliance on federated BTC bridges and a lack of interoperability, leading to fragmentation. BitcoinOS is engineered to surmount these obstacles through:\n\nStory continues\n\nNear Trustless BTC Rails: BitcoinOS revolutionizes Bitcoin transactions by minimizing reliance on federated bridges. Its innovative fraud-proof system ensures that even a single honest participant can thwart fraudulent activities, establishing a communal set of BTC rails for the entire BitcoinOS ecosystem.\n\nInteroperability and Composability: The superchain nature of BitcoinOS, complemented by its shared Compression, Aggregation, and Settlement layer (CASTL), ensures seamless compatibility and composability across different dApps. This eradicates liquidity silos, and fosters shared economic activities among various projects and users.\n\nA Collective Vision for the Future\n\nBitcoinOS is a public good designed to enable sustainability, spur adoption, and cultivate network effects. Multiple projects and developers contribute to its development to enhance Bitcoin for all.\n\nCore contributor Edan Yago emphasizes: \"Our mission has always been to 'Build a World on Bitcoin'. Yet the stark reality was that building on Bitcoin was near impossible. With BitcoinOS, we have not only solved these issues but also built a platform for others to develop on Bitcoin truly. The operating system nature of BitcoinOS will result in powerful network effects that will benefit Sovryn and the broader Bitcoin community.\"\n\nAs a revolutionary platform designed to push the limits of innovation on Bitcoin, BitcoinOS represents the next major leap for the world's most valuable cryptocurrency. Unleashing Bitcoin's full potential as a decentralized, programmable, scalable, and interoperable system, BitcoinOS leads the way in catapulting Bitcoin beyond its current standing as digital gold. It transforms Bitcoin into a robust system for tokens, developers, and institutions to flourish.\n\nBitcoinOS has the potential to transform Bitcoin into the largest player in DeFi.\n\nAbout Sovryn\n\nSovryn is at the vanguard of Bitcoin-native, decentralized trading, and lending, empowering users with a permissionless, non-custodial, and censorship-resistant platform. Sovryn ensures users maintain autonomous control over their Bitcoin, enabling more functionalities like Bitcoin-backed stablecoins, 0% interest loans, and seamless trading without intermediaries. As the preeminent Bitcoin DeFi platform, Sovryn is reshaping the landscape with over $2 billion in trades and is accessible through $SOV on Gate.io and the Sovryn dApp.\n\nLearn more about BitcoinOS at sovryn.com/bitcoinos and follow along on Twitter at @SovrynBTC as well as on Sovryn's Telegram channel https://t.me/SovrynBitcoin .\n\nMedia Contact\n\nCompany: Sovryn\n\nContact: Shir Comay, Communication Lead\n\nEmail: shir@remake.money\n\nWebsite: https://sovryn.com/\n\nSOURCE: Sovryn\n\n\n\n"

This symbol has become a universal identifier, transcending borders and languages and representing a new era of digital finance.\n\nThe Digital Dynamics: Understanding the Anatomy of Bitcoin\n\nDigital Wallets: Containers of Digital Wealth\n\nIn the digital realm, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t exist in a physical form.

This would only be worsened if the price of Bitcoin failed to reach a level that would cover these costs.\n\nMany market commentators also believe Bitcoin will experience a significant jump in the price in the months following the halving.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miner Hut 8 shares tank 23% amid accusations from short-sellers\n\nDan Rosen, the associate director of derivatives at Bitcoin miner Luxor, told Cointelegraph that miners often employ a range of strategies to hedge their exposure to BTC. This typically looks like purchasing derivatives products, such as hash rate futures contracts and BTC-related options to try and smooth out any potential volatility.\n\nCointelegraph contacted several Bitcoin miners listed in the report for comment but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nMagazine: MakerDAO\u2019s plan to bring back \u2018DeFi summer\u2019 \u2014 Rune Christensen"

        "content": "Bloink: Many investors may not have the knowledge to realize that these new bitcoin ETFs are actually likely to be a less efficient way for clients to invest in cryptocurrency generally. Clients should understand that the spot bitcoin ETF will trade only during market hours, as opposed to 24-7 trading options. The fees associated with the ETF can also reduce the value of the investment over time, even if the increased costs are relatively small in the short term.\n\nByrnes: The spot bitcoin ETF gives investors an alternative to direct ownership that has the potential to reduce risk yet still allow for a cryptocurrency component to the client\u2019s investment portfolio. That\u2019s likely to attract an entirely new class of investors to the crypto arena as this is a much more palatable and marketable way to access the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.\n\nBloink: The ETF structure itself will lead to a situation where the price of the spot bitcoin ETF is different from the underlying price of the bitcoin asset. All in all, these issues should be discussed with clients and will likely discourage investment in the ETF version in some situations, especially for clients who are just considering jumping into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nByrnes: Spot bitcoin ETFs registered a trading volume of about $14 billion in the first week they were available to investors. These spot ETFs are a great way to actually avoid some of the costs incurred by existing bitcoin ETFs, which must roll over the underlying contracts into new contracts once the original contracts have expired. That itself creates costs that can weigh down the value of the fund and make it less attractive overall.\n\nBloink: Yes, these new spot bitcoin ETFs make it easier for everyday clients to invest in bitcoin in a more direct manner within their own brokerage accounts. However, even the SEC\u2019s approval letter contained a stern warning for investors \u2014 reminding them that these bitcoin ETFs are entirely different from ETFs where the underlying assets are metals or other commodities with a physical use. These spot bitcoin ETFs must be thoroughly evaluated by advisors and clients before they make the investment decision."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) faces months of struggle to reclaim lost ground and challenge local highs, investor Chris Burniske predicts.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Jan. 25, Burniske, who is now a partner at crypto venture capital firm Placeholder, said that the BTC price should \u201cat least\u201d drop to $30,000.\n\nBurniske bets on new BTC price lows before \u201cactual move\u201d\n\nBitcoin continues to field bearish price prognoses, and an increasing number of crypto industry household names are calling for lower.\n\nBurniske is now among them \u2014 and his floor target is lower than some others.\n\n\u201cImo bitcoin to *at least* $30-36K before a local bottom, and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we test the mid-to-high 20s before all is said and done, and we can make an actual move towards previous ATHs,\u201d he summarized.\n\n\u201cThe path to get there will be volatile-- expect fakeouts, and will take months to play out.\u201d\n\nThe theory appears to take BTC/USD beyond April\u2019s block subsidy halving, expecting the recovery from this month\u2019s 20% dip to be a much longer-term affair.\n\nWhile Bitcoin may suffer, altcoins will have a harder time, Burniske forecasts.\n\n\u201cAs always, patience is your friend,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m right, for the most part, other names will drop more in % terms than $BTC.\u201d\n\nThe former crypto lead at ARK Invest added that he was not prepared to change his long BTC position in spite of the potential upcoming downside.\n\nFew see Bitcoin dip asover\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, multiple factors currently influence calls for BTC price strength to keep weakening going forward.\n\nRelated: 3 reasons why Bitcoin hitting $38.5K marked the \u2018ETF dip\u2019\n\nThese include macroeconomic phenomena tied to United States financial policy and global liquidity trends, the latter a source of sensitivity for crypto markets.\n\nEarlier this week, Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, predicted that Bitcoin could fall to $30,000 before recovering.\n\nMore drastic predictions include that of notorious trader Il Capo of Crypto, who still believes that $12,000 is on the table. For the time being, however, he sees a reprieve for Bitcoin bulls.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, local bottom is in for a while. Confirmation would be a reclaim of the 40k level (it would confirm a deviation below this level, taking all the liquidity that was there),\u201d part of his latest Telegram channel analysis reads.\n\n\u201cTarget for a lower high would be 44k-45k.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour chart.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has seen a notable drop in several digital assets in January, with inscription tokens \u2014 aka BRC-20 tokens \u2014 such as ORDI and SATS among the most affected.\n\nInscription tokens\u2019 performance. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nThe reasons behind the underperformance of these unique tokens include several other important factors in addition to Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) recent price fluctuations.\n\nLower demand for inscriptions\n\nNotably, the price of ORDI and SATS has fallen by approximately 34.50% and 50%, respectively, so far in 2024.\n\nORDI, SATS, BTC and crypto market\u2019s daily performance comparison chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe decline has appeared primarily due to a mounting \u201csell the news\u201d sentiment across the crypto market, led by Bitcoin. As of Jan. 25, the correlation coefficient between ORDI and BTC was 0.66; it has remained positive throughout recent history.\n\nORDI/USDT and BTC/USDT daily correlation coefficient performance. Source: TradingView\n\nFurthermore, this bearish momentum has aligned with a noticeable decrease in inscription fees and Bitcoin block size share, highlighting a diminishing demand for Bitcoin ordinals.\n\nBitcoin inscription fees. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe price movements of inscription tokens tend to closely align with BTC itself, largely because Bitcoin Ordinals uses Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nORDI, for example, involves inscribing data directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, creating a unique form of digital artifact that exists within Bitcoin\u2019s transaction outputs.\n\nTechnical conditions\n\nIn addition to broader market trends, bearish divergence signals were key in recent ORDI and SATS price drops.\n\nFor instance, the ORDI/USDT daily chart exhibited a classic bearish divergence pattern between Dec. 5, 2023, and Jan. 2, 2024. Simply put, ORDI\u2019s price was forming higher highs, but its relative strength index (RSI) was making lower highs.\n\nORDI/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe following 45% pullback was consistent with the bearish divergence signal, where the discrepancy between the RSI and the price action precedes a price correction.\n\nSimilarly, SATS\u2019s price retreated by over 60% after signaling a bearish divergence between its rising prices and falling RSI.\n\nSATS/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nOverall, the bearish divergence on the ORDI and SATS charts warranted attention from traders, as it indicated a potential trend reversal or at least a pause in the prevailing uptrend.\n\nORDI, SATS price analysis\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, ORDI has more room to decline in the coming days or weeks.\n\nNotably, the cryptocurrency has been undergoing an ascending triangle reversal breakdown. This refers to a situation where an ascending triangle pattern fails to act as a continuation pattern and instead leads to a trend reversal.\n\nRelated: Bitwise Bitcoin ETF wallet attracts inscriptions and rare sats donations\n\nORDI\u2019s breakdown target comes to be around $38.50 by February, measured after calculating the maximum distance between the triangle\u2019s upper and lower trendline and subtracting the outcome from the breakdown point, as shown above.\n\nORDI/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nInterestingly, the $38.50 target coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement line.\n\nOn the other hand, SATS has dropped toward its resistance-turned-support level of $0.00000036. Simultaneously, its RSI has dropped below 30, an oversold territory. Both indicators hint at a potential rebound move toward 0.00000043 by February.\n\nSATS/USDT daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nConversely, a break below the $0.00000036 support risks crashing SATS\u2019s price toward its 0.786 Fib line of $0.0000029.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
