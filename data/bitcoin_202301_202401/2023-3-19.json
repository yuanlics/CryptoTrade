        "title": "The Growing Use of Cryptocurrencies by Transnational Organized Crime Groups in Latin America - Georgetown Journal of International Affairs",
        "content": "Across Latin America, transnational criminal organizations, transnational gangs, and extra-regional actors supporting authoritarian regimes are exploiting growing cracks in the region\u2019s weak financial regulations by transferring parts of their financial holdings to cryptocurrency, thereby avoiding detection and asset seizures. Opportunities for criminal use of crypto have significantly increased in the past few years; a growing number of high corruption governments, which also act as money laundering havens, are actively courting unvetted crypto investors with purposeful deregulation and opacity.\n\nAcross Latin America, transnational criminal organizations that move billions of dollars a year in illicit profits are transferring parts of their financial holdings to cryptocurrencies as a way of avoiding detection and asset seizures. Many different groups, including the Mexico-based Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (CJNG) and Sinaloa Cartel, Central America-based MS-13 (Mara Salvatrucha), and Brazil-based PCC (Primeiro Comando da Capital), are discovering growing cracks in the regional anti-money laundering architecture that make the switch to cryptocurrencies increasingly attractive. The drop in value of most digital currencies may slow the trend in the short term, but as prices stabilize it will likely continue to grow in the mid to long term.\n\nWhile criminal use of cryptocurrencies is a global problem, Latin America, in particular, is a region where criminal groups take advantage of \u201cunregulated exchanges that do not require registration information and proof of identification for tracking purposes,\u201d per one specialized report. These groups often deposit Bitcoin into exchange accounts and trade it for various altcoins, obscuring the original source account.\n\nThere are multiple cases that demonstrate this trend, offering a useful but incomplete view of the magnitude of the changes underway. Blockchain systems are designed to make tracing transactions anonymous and even aggressive regulatory efforts around the world are in their infancy. As such, conceptualizing the expansion of blockchain systems in Latin America relies on compelling anecdotal evidence and analysis of the potential threats rather than quantitative data. For example, in December 2022, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) found that the CJNG used Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, to move $15 million to $40 million in illicit proceeds from the sale of cocaine and methamphetamines, combining new products and new laundering methods.\n\nThe December 2021 murder of a PCC leader in Brazil led to a Sao Paulo police investigation that found widespread use of cryptocurrency by the gang, including a $7.8 million transaction. In that same month, the US Treasury Department designated the PCC as a major criminal organization. In a separate Brazilian case, the so-called \u201cPharoah of Bitcoin\u201d ran a pyramid scheme, reportedly taking in $67 million from local and international investors, and is now enmeshed in allegations of murder, drug trafficking, and money laundering.\n\nOur fieldwork in the Northern Triangle of Central America (El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala) has found that the MS-13 transnational gang, designated by the US government as a major criminal organization since 2012, is increasingly demanding payment in Bitcoin for transporting cocaine to Mexico and in extortion cases. Given that almost all the gang\u2019s criminal activity is cash-based and growing rapidly, the ubiquity of Bitcoin ATMs and the ease of convertibility to dollars has made it more convenient and safer to use blockchain wallets than hoarding physical money in safe houses.\n\nIn addition to transnational criminal activities, state-run Bitcoin operations like Chivo Wallet in El Salvador have been widely used by transnational groups to scam users of millions of dollars. Finally, Russia and its allies in the hemisphere, such as the Maduro regime in Venezuela, have developed cryptocurrencies specifically designed to evade US and EU sanctions by bypassing the Western currency markets. A Russian national living in Uruguay designed and advised the development of the Venezuelan Petro crypto currency, a value transfer only useable between Venezuela and Russia through Russian banks. While not directly tied to transnational organized crime, the Maduro regime is widely recognized as financing itself through the sale of cocaine and illegally mined gold, meaning that much of the value transferred through the Petro system is likely derived from criminal activity.\n\nThe growth of cryptocurrency in transnational criminal organizations is difficult to quantify, but likely accelerating. This trend has been made possible by the growing number of high-corruption jurisdictions where deregulation is purposeful, and the currencies are welcomed for their opacity. The percentage of global cryptocurrency in Latin America has grown from about 6 percent in 2017 to 16 percent in 2020. Most of Latin America lacks robust banking regulations or Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, while efforts in the hemisphere to regulate cryptocurrencies are in their infancy, including in the United States. With the exception of Mexico and Venezuela, the vast majority of the countries across the region have only ad hoc regulations or notional discussions of regulations. The promotion of cryptocurrency by high-corruption countries provides growing access to and uses for these currencies in markets that are almost completely unregulated and unmonitored.\n\nEl Salvador has come under increasing scrutiny for its disregard for any regulation. More than a dozen senior members of President Nayib Bukele\u2019s administration and legislative allies have been sanctioned by the United States and had their visas revoked because of massive corruption. Additionally, the World Bank is withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in loans because of those concerns and government corruption.\n\nThe concerns began September 2021, when Bukele used his growing authoritarian power to make his country the world\u2019s first to declare Bitcoin legal tender on par with the US dollar, which is already El Salvador\u2019s legal currency. The law requires all major businesses accept Bitcoin and, while few people use the currency regularly, the cryptocurrency is both easy to use and easy to convert, which is at least a partial explanation for why the MS-13 and other gangs are pushing into its use. In addition to offering no regulation or monitoring of Bitcoin transactions, El Salvador also offers residency and citizenship based solely on Bitcoin purchases, creating a haven for those seeking safe harbor from prosecution for any crime. Further concerns about corruption emerged after Bukele tweeted about trading Bitcoin naked using funds from the national treasury, held in his private wallet, while losing an estimated $22 million with no accountability, transparency, or oversight.\n\nParaguay, a small, landlocked, and isolated nation in South America that is already a money laundering haven, is moving to follow El Salvador\u2019s blueprint for luring cryptocurrency business. While there are few public cases of the use of cryptocurrency by transnational criminal groups in Paraguay, financial crimes prosecutors and police investigators say that there are multiple cases. A number of factors make prosecuting such cases impossible.\n\nOne factor is that former president Horacio Cartes, who retains enormous economic and political influence, as well as the sitting vice president, who has a direct hand in cryptocurrency regulation, both have been designated \u201ccorrupt actors\u201d by the US government and had their US visas revoked. The designations, also applied to Cartes\u2019 US-based businesses, were compounded by public US allegations of both men\u2019s financial and political ties to the Lebanese-base Hezbollah, a designated terrorist group.\n\nThe interest of Cartes and his political acolytes still in power is a cause for concern because he is also the owner of the country\u2019s largest business conglomerate, which includes banks, hotels, media organizations, and cigarette factories. Cartes\u2019 economic power, access to the judiciary, and control of the media work together to keep many cases, including several tied to cryptocurrency money laundering, from coming to light.\n\nParaguay\u2019s competitive advantage is that it is the only country in the world that is solely reliant on renewable energy (hydroelectric power), meaning Bitcoin mining is relatively cheap and electricity is relatively plentiful. Since 2018, Paraguay has promoted itself as a Bitcoin hub. It is also one of the key corners of the Tri-Border region, along with Brazil and Argentina, where money laundering, cocaine trafficking, contraband, and other illicit activities by groups like the PCC dominate.\n\nWhile data is sparse, there is compelling case evidence and fieldwork research that shows transnational criminal organizations and transnational gangs are increasingly using cryptocurrencies to move and hide the profits from their illicit activities. A growing number of countries overwhelmed by endemic corruption, weak or non-existent regulatory infrastructure, and deliberately opaque crypto policies, help create an exceptionally fertile environment for this growth.\n\nGiven that how\u2014and even if\u2014to regulate cryptocurrency is an ongoing global debate, there is no quick policy prescription to keep transnational organized crime organizations from migrating to these systems to reduce the risk of asset tracing and seizure. However, US policymakers can take some steps to slow the trend.\n\nA first step is the development and implementation of basic KYC regulation and transparency in jurisdictions promoting the use of cryptocurrencies comparable to those in the formal banking structure. This form of regulation of the banking sector is a fundamental pillar of avoiding designation by the US State Department as a money laundering haven. These conditions should be met to avoid being named, shamed, and sanctioned by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in the form of being placed on its gray list and black list jurisdictions. This should be accompanied by US efforts to keep countries from granting citizenship based on cryptocurrency investments that likely incentivize fleeing justice in other jurisdictions. Such a policy could be achieved by refusing to recognize these types of citizenship documents. Finally, the United States can play a key role in helping regional institutions such as the Organization of America States (OAS) and regional development banks establish common crypto guidelines and regulations across the hemisphere.\n\n. . .\n\nDouglas Farah is the president and founder of IBI Consultants, a national security consulting firm focusing on transnational organized crime and extra-regional actors in Latin America, working with the US government, research foundations, and private clients.

The digital currency has added more than 20% since the start of the month to trade around $28,000, its highest since June of last year when a series of implosions within the digital-assets space itself rocked the industry and pressured prices. It last traded at $30,000 during the meltdown of now bankrupt lender Celsius, also in June."

        "title": "Bitcoin briefly tops $28,000 for the first time in 9 months after bank crisis sparks weekend rally - CNBC",
        "content": "On Monday, the cryptocurrency had pulled back a bit. Bitcoin fell more than 2% to $27,705.23, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier in the day, it hit $28,554.07, it's highest level in nine months. Meanwhile, ether fell 3.5% to $1,765.60.\n\nThe weekend rally in bitcoin came amid continued turmoil in the global banking sector. On Sunday, UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) in a deal partly brokered by the Swiss regulators looking to stem contagion.\n\n\"Bitcoin continues to trade like a leading risk-on asset, like it has for the past two years,\" said James Lavish, managing partner at the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund. \"The rescue of Credit Suisse has put out a large credit fire ... this emboldens bitcoin buyers who are now anticipating the Fed slowing the increase in rates and signaling a coming pause this week.\"\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, there is about a 72% chance of a quarter-point increase by the Fed, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The other 28% anticipates there will be no hike and that Chairman Jerome Powell may start to ease his aggressive tightening campaign due to the emerging financial contagion.\n\nBitcoin is coming off its best week since January 2021, which was right before the first bull run that year, while ether just posted its best weekly gain since August 2021. The two are up for the year by 67% and 46%, respectively.\n\nFlight to safety\n\nAdvocates of bitcoin have often dubbed it \"digital gold\" referring to it as a store of value, particularly in moments of global turmoil, and one that is uncorrelated with other asset classes.\n\nNow, there are signals bitcoin's price movement is beginning to decouple from stocks, for now. The cryptocurrency's correlation with the S&P 500 is now at its lowest since September 2021, after reaching its highest in 2022, according to Coin Metrics.\n\n\"If one looks at the history of bitcoin and why it was created in the first place, it was precisely for events like this where the current system shows signs of weakness and hence owning an uncorrelated asset helps,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC. \"Over the years, this argument of bitcoin being an uncorrelated asset class has been debated quite a bit, but we are now potentially seeing that viewpoint being vindicated.\"\n\nBernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal argued in a Monday note that the market has been trading closer to its \"uncorrelated non-sovereign roots\" since the demise of FTX and the market structure \"feels a lot healthier, with no more distortions caused by FTX and Alameda.\"\n\nIn contrast to bitcoin and ether's year-to-date gains, returns on gold, the dollar, U.S. equities and bonds were \"less impaired last year, but have not bounced back as sharply\" either, and tech-dominated indices have performed only marginally better when high growth assets were beaten down during the rising rate cycle, they added."

        "content": "Bitcoin jumped over the weekend to briefly breach US$28,000 in a bullish trend that extended into Monday morning trading in Asia and helped send most of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies higher. Bitcoin led the gainers amid growing concern about the state of the global banking industry. Several central banks over the weekend said they would coordinate an effort to pump cash into markets to ensure liquidity. This after Swiss authorities orchestrated an emergency weekend takeover of global investment bank Credit Suisse by UBS, which in turn followed a series of bank failures in the U.S. this month.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin rises above US$26,000, as \u2018store of value\u2019 narrative strengthens amid bank failures\n\nBitcoin rose 2.96% in the past 24 hours to US$27,929 at 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong to post a weekly gain of 23.24%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has surged more than 66% from the start of the year and briefly traded above US$28,000 at the weekend, breaking that ceiling for the first time since June 12 last year.\n\nThe main driver behind Bitcoin\u2019s gains is concern about the fragile economic landscape in the U.S., Kadan Stadelmann, chief technical officer of blockchain infrastructure development firm Komodo, told Forkast on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve embarked upon a many-trillion dollar quantitative easing program, cut the minimum bank reserves from 10% to 0% on March 26, 2020, and led us into the current bout with inflation, which has led people to seek alternative ways to preserve wealth. Bitcoin has become a prominent option,\u201c wrote Stadelmann.\n\nEther dipped 0.02% to US$1,777, but is up 9.24% over the past seven days.\n\nXRP rose 2.61% to US$0.3874, up 3.04% for the week. Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, hinted in an interview with Thinking Crypto last Friday that Coinbase might relist XRP.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic token fell 2.30% to US$1.16, slashing its gain for the week to just 0.23%, even after Polygon Labs unveiled a partnership with enterprise software giant Salesforce last Thursday to develop NFT-based loyalty programs.\n\nThe bank turmoil dominated moves in capital markets and may force the Federal Reserve to revise its monetary policy of raising interest rates, adding to inflation risks and prompting more investors to see Bitcoin as a safe haven, according to a Bloomberg News report on Monday.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 1.46% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours dipped 2.70% to US$65.76 billion.\n\nWorries about the banking industry drove U.S. equities lower on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.19%, the S&P 500 fell 1.10%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index moved 0.74% lower. Shares in First Republic Bank fell 32.80% on Friday despite a US$30 billion injection from major U.S. financial institutions earlier in the week.\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Sunday announced a coordinated move with the central banks of Canada, the U.K., European Union, Japan and Switzerland to make more U.S. dollars available to improve market liquidity.\n\nThe move to pump cash into markets helped U.S. stock futures edge up as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures moved up 0.19%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.28%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.41%.\n\nOn the inflation front, the University of Michigan reported on Friday an unexpected drop in the U.S. consumer sentiment index in March, the first decline in four months. The report indicates the Federal Reserve\u2019s higher interest rate policy of the past 12 months is cooling off inflation.\n\nU.S. interest rates are between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 76.8% chance the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points when the bank meets this week, and a 23.2% chance of no rate hike, an increase from 20.3% on Friday."

        "content": "Keep an Eye on These Coins\n\nThe cryptocurrency market experienced a sudden surge in value over the last week, after an extended rough period. The current turmoil in the bank sector appears to have given a boost to the crypto market, especially Bitcoin, as some investors opt for digital assets for diversification.\n\nThis week, we examine Bitcoin (BTC), Conflux (CFX), Mask Network (MASK), Fantom (FTM), and Neo (NEO). In selecting these assets, we have considered several factors, including positive technical developments, significant news events, and noticeable price changes.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price advanced around 25% in the wake of several unsettling incidents in the global economy and banking sector.\n\nConflux (CFX)'s price jumped 125%, possibly in reaction to integrations with major companies in China.\n\nMask Network (MASK)'s price rose more than 80%, as large, influential investors began accumulating the token and crypto exchange Binance added it to its proof-of-reserves system.\n\nThe price of Fantom (FTM) gained more than 24% amid a mainnet upgrade.\n\nThe price of the NEO (NEO) token went up by more than 20%, potentially due to its growing China presence, as well as the fact that crypto trading is being embraced by Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin (BTC) jumped in the latest week, increasing by about 25%. The cryptocurrency has finally broken through its recent resistance levels, meaning the price zone that the digital asset has had trouble breaking above in technical analysis.\n\nThe driver for this sudden rise might be turbulent global economic conditions. Historically, investors flocked to Bitcoin when there have been troubling events in traditional markets. The failure of several banks, inflation rates, and dollar-liquidity decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve all may have contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s price surge.\n\nBTC is hovering at around $28,067 after trading around $22,450 last week (see chart below).\n\nBTC price: TradingView\n\nConflux (CFX)\n\nConflux (CFX) was the biggest gainer this week, with the CFX token more than doubling in price and crossing the $1 billion market-capitalization figure. There are several possible factors feeding the price increase, with one being the project's integration with China\u2019s version of Instagram, Xiaohongshu. The project also announced the launch of SIM cards using Conflux Network's blockchain support in collaboration with China Telecom.\n\nConflux is a blockchain network that offers fast transaction processing for anything from nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to cryptocurrency wallets. CFX started last week at about 19 cents and is now priced at around 43 cents (see chart below).\n\n\n\nCFX price: TradingView\n\nMask Network (MASK)\n\nThe Mask Network\u2019s MASK token (MASK) was another major gainer in the latest week, increasing by more than 80%. The jump may be tied to trades by large buyers\u2014known as whales in crypto terminology\u2014and the fact that crypto exchange Binance added the asset to its proof-of-reserves system along with 10 other tokens.\n\nThe crypto whales' buying of large sums of MASK has in turn attracted a greater number of smaller buyers. Proof of reserves is a transparent auditing practice for crypto companies like Binance that provides an unbiased report of the companies\u2019 assets in reserve. MASK is now hovering at around $5.80 after being priced at about $3.20 last week (see chart below).\n\nMASK price: TradingView\n\nFantom (FTM)\n\nThe Fantom (FTM) coin increased by more than 24%, likely due to a mainnet upgrade and possibly in line with the fact that the project offers some of the lowest transaction fees on the market. Mainnet is used to describe the point at which a blockchain protocol is fully developed and deployed, with crypto transactions being broadcast, verified, and recorded on a distributed ledger. Fantom's upgrade allows its network to process certain files and logs more quickly.\n\nFantom's latest upgrade also speeds up block processing times by 30%. That metric determines how quickly each block of transactions is finalized. FTM is now valued at around 48 cents after trading last week at 39 cents (see chart below).\n\n\n\nFTM price: TradingView\n\nNeo (NEO)\n\nNEO (NEO)'s coin increased in price by about 20%, possibly because crypto coins with a presence in China are experiencing a resurgence, according to one crypto analyst on Twitter. The fact that Hong Kong, since late 2022, has taken a more friendly stance toward crypto trading may be another reason for the token\u2019s gain.\n\nNEO is a general-purpose crypto network and ecosystem that offers features such as decentralized storage, smart-contract functionality, and decentralized applications, known as dApps. NEO is now valued at around $12.65 but was trading at about $10.70 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nNEO price: TradingView\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

Its digital asset impairment charges \u2014 which comes into play if the market value of bitcoin decreases below its market-adjusted purchase value \u2014 were $198 million during the quarter.\n\nExecutives said on an earnings call last month that the firm planned to continue its longtime strategy of buying and holding bitcoin on its balance sheet.\n\nDan Weiskopf \u2014 a co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) \u2014 told Blockworks that bitcoin\u2019s price is more relevant to traders than to MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor.\n\nSaylor has made it clear his company will be a strategic longterm bitcoin owner.\n\n\u201cSome investors may mark the moment when MicroStrategy\u2019s 132,500 BTC is at a breakeven level; I don\u2019t think Saylor ever thought that was not a high probability,\u201d Weiskopf told Blockworks. \u201cIn fact, I am confident for him it is a short-term mark and only the beginning for what he expects bitcoin will accomplish.\u201d\n\nA MicroStrategy spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nAnalysts have been critical of the company in the past about its buying and holding strategy amid market volatility.\n\nEdward Moya, a senior market analyst for foreign exchange company OANDA, said last June that MicroStrategy \u201chas failed to capitalize on the way up and find protection when things got ugly,\u201d adding that the company has been \u201creckless with their portfolio management.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s unrealized losses when bitcoin dropped to below $16,000 in November, MicroStrategy\u2019s totaled nearly $2 billion.\n\nNew bull indicator\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rally of late has closed that unrealized gap.\n\n\u201cMicrostrategy has survived a crypto ice age and now has an opportunity to take advantage of growing interest in DeFi and all the other crypto protocols with better growth potential,\u201d Moya told Blockworks Monday. \u201cWith no true bitcoin ETF coming, Microstrategy is still positioned to attract new investors.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s stock price was $261.50 at 3 pm ET Monday \u2014 up about 80% year to date, but down roughly 2% on the day.\n\nWeiskopf said the latest bitcoin price gains have been caused in part by the broadening of BTC use cases \u2014 such as bitcoin ordinals \u2014 that could spur MicroStrategy to buy even more of the asset.\n\nMarcus Sotiriou, a market analyst at GlobalBlock, said in a research note that bitcoin reaching $28,000 over the weekend signals the start of a new bull trend.\n\n\u201cThe recent closures of US banking giants have acted as a catalyst for bitcoin\u2019s price increase,\u201d Sotiriou wrote. \u201cThe drawbacks of the banking system are a key proponent for decentralized assets such as bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMorningstar senior research analyst Madeline Hume said MicroStrategy has vowed to add to its bitcoin position while cash flows are in excess of working capital\u2014 and while equity raises are feasible.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s working capital is negative, Hume said, suggesting additional purchases are unlikely in the short term.\n\n\u201cAcross the capital markets, liquidity raises have ground to a halt given the jittery macro environment,\u201d she told Blockworks. \u201cAny additional tactical moves, including a liquidation of some portion of the bitcoin holdings, would depend on the firm\u2019s ability to finance its activities in other ways, including the firm\u2019s ability to borrow.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Its price has skyrocketed from $16,500 on January 1 to approximately $28,400 at the moment of writing these lines (a 70% increase).\n\nThe rally caused some to believe that the bear market could be over and that BTC has entered into a new bull run. One example is Eric Peters \u2013 CEO of One River Digital Asset Management \u2013 who recently claimed that the next phase will be \u201cvery powerful\u201d because major institutions will dive in.\n\nRyan Selkis \u2013 CEO of the crypto intelligence firm Messari \u2013 also outlined a favorable scenario for bitcoin, forecasting its valuation to surge to $100,000 in the next twelve months.\n\nHe thinks it will act as \u201ca life raft and peaceful exit option\u201d to the adverse events in the financial world, including additional bank collapses, that could occur in the near future.\n\nThe most bullish prediction came from Coinbase\u2019s former CTO \u2013 Balaji Srinivasan \u2013 who wagered $2 million against Twitter user James Medlock that bitcoin will be worth $1 million in 90 days. He believes the price expansion will happen due to a possible collapse of the US banking system and consecutive hyperinflation.\n\n\u201cI am moving $2M into USDC for the bet. I will do it with Medlock and one other person, sufficient to prove the point. See my next tweet. Everyone else should just go buy Bitcoin, as it\u2019ll be much cheaper for you than locking one up for 90 days,\u201d Srinivasan said."

        "content": "Turmoil in the banking sector, hotter-than expected inflation data, and renewed hopes for a dovish Federal Reserve has Bitcoin reaching levels not seen in about nine months.\n\nThe largest digital asset topped $28,000 for the first time since June 2022, trading for as much as $28,258 on Sunday. Since the start of the year, Bitcoin\u2019s price has risen almost 70%. Other digital assets rallied as well \u2014 with Ethereum up about 17% since the start of last week and so-called altcoins like Solana and Cardano advancing, too.\n\nTraders waded high levels of uncertainty last week in markets. US two-year yields fluctuated wildly, and the Cboe Volatility Index, the so-called fear gauge also known as the VIX, spiked above 30. But Bitcoin kept steadfast \u2014 and straight up.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is correlated with liquidity conditions and real rates. Real rates have declined, liquidity conditions have expanded, and it looks as if we\u2019re entering a new regime,\u201d said Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex.\n\nBroader markets fluctuated in the past week after a handful of US lenders failed, and fresh concerns arose around Credit Suisse Group AG before UBS Group AG agreed to buy its fellow Swiss bank on Sunday. In the fallout, some investors have called on the Fed to pause interest rate hikes. But midweek data showed that core CPI advanced more than expected, a reminder that the fight against inflation is far from done. It\u2019s unclear how the central bank will respond to the conflicting signals at this week\u2019s Fed meeting.\n\nThat uncertainty troubled many corners of the financial world but emboldened Bitcoin bulls who see the digital asset as a hedge against inflation, despite last year\u2019s evidence to the contrary. In 2022, a series of bankruptcies and scandals pushed the price of Bitcoin down more than 60%.\n\nThe token also rose in spite of internal strife in the digital asset space. USD Coin briefly lost its peg with the dollar this month, and the US Securities & Exchange Commission is doubling down on the belief that most digital assets qualify as securities.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 1.1% on Friday. If Bitcoin were still trading like it did for much of 2022, the token would have slumped alongside US stocks. But this month, the correlation between the digital asset and the S&P 500 has dissipated.\n\n\u201cIn this instance, we are definitely seeing people look to Bitcoin,\u201d said David Martin, head of institutional coverage at digital asset prime brokerage FalconX.\n\n\u2013With assistance from Muyao Shen."

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nBitcoin has grown in value by more than a third over the last 10 days, prompting predictions of a record-breaking crypto rally over the coming months.\n\nThe world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached its highest price in 2023 on Monday morning, reaching above $28,000 having started the year below $17,000.\n\nIt remains a long way off the all-time high it hit in November 2021 of close to $69,000, though crises within the traditional financial sector have seen optimism return to the crypto market.\n\nFormer Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan expressed his positivity for bitcoin\u2019s near-term price trajectory by placing a $2 million bet that 1 BTC will hit $1 million in the next 90 days.\n\nThe wager was made on Twitter after user James Medlock wrote that he would \u201cbet anyone $1 million that the US does not enter hyperinflation\u201d.\n\nMr Srinivasan took up the offer, proposing the terms that if he loses then he will send Mr Medlock 1 BTC and $1 million of the stablecoin USD Coin, which is pegged to the US dollar. If he wins, then he keeps the bitcoin and the stablecoin.\n\n\u201cYou buy 1 BTC. I will send $1M USD,\u201d the former Coinbase exec tweeted. \u201cThis is ~40:1 odds as 1 BTC is worth ~$26k. The term is 90 days.\u201d\n\nMr Srinivasan said he believed that the meteoric price rise would come as a result of hyperinflation of the US dollar.\n\n\u201cThe central bank, the banks, and the bank regulators have bankrupted all of us,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey hid their insolvency from you, the depositors. And they\u2019re about to print $2T to hyperinflate the dollar. In the digital age this will happen very quickly. So buy bitcoin *now* and get your coins off exchanges. \u201c\n\nPrevious bets have been made by high-profile figures about bitcoin hitting the $1 million mark, with the late cyber security pioneer John McAfee saying in 2017 that he thought it would happen by 2020.\n\n\u201cIf not, I will eat my d**k on national television,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nIn July 2020, when bitcoin was around $10,000, he said: \u201cI never believed bitcoin would hit $1 mil. It\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s an old, tired, worthless coin. I just wanted to eat my d**k on TV. Wait for it.\u201d\n\nHe was arrested later that year and died in a Spanish prison cell in June 2021 before he had a chance to fulfil the bet."

        "content": "How Has Bitcoin Maintained Its Dominance Over Other Cryptocurrencies?\n\nBitcoin has been the dominant cryptocurrency for many years now, and it has shown no signs of slowing down. This is largely due to its innovative technology, which has enabled it to remain ahead of the competition. The blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin is highly secure and provides users with a way to transfer funds without going through a centralized authority. This means that transactions are faster and more secure than traditional methods.\n\nAnother factor that has kept Bitcoin at the top is its wide acceptance among merchants and users around the world. Nowadays, even the price of Bitcoin can be viewed by any trader anywhere in the world. As more businesses continue to accept Bitcoin as a payment method, this will only further increase its dominance over other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin also benefits from strong community support and development efforts from developers all over the world who are constantly improving its features and security measures. This keeps Bitcoin on top in terms of usability, reliability, and scalability compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nRelated: https://dailybruin.com/2023/03/01/bitcoin-market/\n\nWhat factors have contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s success so far?\n\nOne of the first things that have contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s success is its decentralized nature. Since it is not controlled by any government or institution, then no institution controls it. This has made it attractive to investors who are looking for an alternative to traditional banking systems. Bitcoin is a limited supply, which causes it to be both scarce and very valuable. Also, the fact that it is not controlled by any government or central bank has made it a safe-haven asset, especially in times of economic uncertainty. In addition, since Bitcoin uses blockchain technology, it is very secure, The transactions are typically recorded in a decentralized ledger, which is transparent. Moreover, it is very easy for prospective traders to assess Bitcoin, one only needs an internet connection and a digital wallet. This has increased its success rates so far. Finally, the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate form of payment by major retailers and businesses has also contributed to its success.\n\nWhat advantages does Bitcoin have over other cryptocurrencies?\n\nThe decentralization of Bitcoin is one of its main advantages. This means that no one can manipulate its supply or value, making it more secure than other forms of currency. Also, Bitcoin, due to its long history and standing as the first cryptocurrency, is well-known and thus more accepted. It is also very stable compared to other cryptocurrencies, which makes it less likely to be affected by news and events. This is when compared to altcoins. Bitcoin transactions are fast and secure due to its blockchain technology and encryption. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger that is distributed across multiple computers around the world. And, Bitcoin offers users greater privacy than other cryptocurrencies since all transactions are anonymous and untraceable.\n\nThe potential for future growth in Bitcoin\u2019s popularity\n\nBitcoin has been gaining traction in recent years, and its potential for future growth is something that many people are interested in. Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology provides a secure platform for transactions, making it an attractive option for those looking to make secure payments online. As more businesses begin to accept it as a form of payment, its use will become increasingly widespread and accepted by mainstream society. Also, in future, Bitcoin may start to be accepted in mainstream finance, which hasn\u2019t happened fully currently. Furthermore, with the increased technological advances where Bitcoin is concerned, Bitcoin may continue to be used more and more regularly. Finally, with more countries beginning to recognize and regulate it and other cryptocurrencies, the potential for the future growth of Bitcoin will only increase further."

        "content": "As central banks continue to struggle with economic uncertainty amid concerns of hyperinflation, investors are turning to digital assets to protect their wealth.\n\nBellwether bitcoin (BTC) climbed to its highest level in nine months, just above $28,400, on Sunday \u2014 representing a 69% increase on a year-to-date basis.\n\nPrice action is being driven by spot buys which is positive for the health of the trend, with the market yet to see froth and euphoria in capital allocation, Kurt Grumelart, a trader at Zerocap told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cThe majority of this flow is hedge funds and other large market players positioning themselves in anticipation of a flight to safety more so than the actual flight to safety itself.\u201d\n\nDespite this, a comparison to global markets over the last two weeks shows that bitcoin is being actively considered as a risk hedge alongside and, potentially, instead of gold by serious players, Grumelart added.\n\nBy comparison, traditional markets have fared much worse, impressing long time crypto market watchers.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, which measures the performance of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq, is down about 3.8% for the year.\n\nUS oil, as reflected by the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil index, has also performed poorly, posting a more than 13% loss over the same period. Meanwhile, gold \u2014 often considered a hedge against inflation and market uncertainty \u2014 is up around 9% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent outperformance can be attributed to a number of factors, including the narrative of store-of-value, which has returned to prominence despite its past inability to perform that role in practice.\n\nGrumelart pointed to bitcoin\u2019s storied origins in the 2008 financial crisis, as a tool to combat negligence within the existing financial system, and said the current economic climate marked \u201ca perfect storm\u201d for bitcoin to prove its worth.\n\nThat climate is the culmination of a series of spectacular bank failures in the US and abroad which threatened to boil over this month, prompting regulators to step in and provide a backstop for depositors.\n\nAfter the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the FDIC shut down of Signature Bank, First Republic Bank was also propped up by a private sector rescue and banks drew on nearly $12 billion of loans from the US Federal Reserve\u2019s new emergency lending program.\n\nAnd on Sundsy, Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse was saved from collapse by a takeover from rival UBS in a $3.25 billion deal.\n\nShort-term liquidity boost is bitcoin\u2019s gain\n\nIn total, nearly $300 billion has been supplied via expansion of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet, including of a record $153 billion drawn from the Fed\u2019s discount window.\n\nAll eyes are now locked on the outcome of the next FOMC meeting on Wednesday where the Fed will decide either to scale back its campaign of increased rate hikes, designed to combat inflation, or continue business as usual which has contributed to the breaking of the US retail banking sector.\n\n\u201cA number of central banks are stuck between a rock and a hard place, they simply cannot afford to let the banking sector collapse,\u201d Grumelart said. \u201cWhile the liquidity spike is positive for all assets, the implications of the action just taken are still unknown.\u201d\n\nThe correlation between bitcoin and equities has been largely influenced by the perception the crypto industry, until the recent crisis, served as a risk-on indicator that was closely connected to the economic performance and monetary policies of the US and global markets.\n\nWhile financial companies have been struggling, the tech sector has been resilient, with the Nasdaq Composite up over 4% and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund up about 17% for the year.\n\nTesla and Nvidia, up 67% and 79% YTD respectively, have their own unique drivers that have propelled their prices in recent months, Grumelart said. High-beta risk assets are primarily affected by market liquidity and risk appetite, leading to periods of correlation.\n\nAlthough many risk assets have seen short-term gains, should economic conditions continue to deteriorate, high-growth equities are expected to suffer. But Grumelart is looking for bitcoin to decouple from Big Tech and follow commodities instead.\n\n\u201cIf inflation reaches a double peak, it is likely that most high-performing assets, with the exception of commodities and bitcoin, will reverse most of their gains for the year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world should be glad that we have bitcoin as an option to protect our wealth in moments like this.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Where will they go next?\n\nAfter a week of chaos for macro markets and solid gains as a result, Bitcoin and altcoins are circling levels some have not seen for nine months.\n\nThe 2022 bear market is feeling like an increasingly distant memory as old resistance levels tumble and bulls attempt to cement newly-reclaimed support.\n\nThis week, as last, there are all sorts of potential hurdles to overcome. The Federal Reserve will decide on its next interest rate changes, and new macroeconomic data will drop.\n\nMarkets will likely stay volatile as a result, and any further unexpected events from the banking sector will only add to the instability.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin\u2019s own ecosystem is set to become stronger than ever as network fundamentals launch to fresh all-time highs.\n\nCointelegraph takes a look at five of the key phenomena to keep an eye on when it comes to BTC price action in the coming week.\n\nFed rate hike cycle in doubt\n\nThe macro event of the week is undeniably the March 22 Fed decision on interest rate hikes \u2014 or lack thereof.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) faces a stark challenge to its current quantitative tightening policy in place for the past 18 months.\n\nThe unfolding banking crisis has put into doubt the Fed\u2019s ability to keep raising interest rates, a policy some commentators argue was the death knell for struggling regional banks.\n\nThe Fed is nonetheless caught between a rock and a hard place. Raising rates would keep inflation in check but further punish the economy, possibly unleashing a new wave of bank failures.\n\n\u201cNext week's FOMC is gearing up to be one of the most interesting ones in a while, with no one really agreeing on what's gonna happen,\u201d engineer and trader Tree of Alpha summarized.\n\n\u201cOdds at leaning towards 25bps, but it\u2019s a wildcard. Planning on longing <=0bps and shorting >=50 bps as the safe play.\u201d\n\nAccording to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, the consensus as of March 20 favors the Fed hiking by 25 basis points, rather than pausing hikes altogether. The week prior, Goldman Sachs predicted that rates would plateau, while Nomura even forecasted a rate cut.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart. Source: CME Group\n\n\u201cThis week, the long anticipated March Fed interest rate decision comes out. Currently, markets are pricing in a 62% chance of a 25 bps rate hike. However, markets also see 100 bps of rate cuts by December,\u201d wrote financial commentary resource The Kobeissi Letter in part of an analysis of the long-term rate hike roadmap.\n\nKobeissi and others also queried how struggling bank stocks would react at the next Wall Street open, given the latest government moves over the weekend, including a buyout of Credit Suisse, the European banking giant that saw a particularly violent reaction to the U.S. meltdown.\n\n\u201cCredit Suisse, $CS, was worth $10 billion a month ago and sold for pennies on the Dollar,\u201d Kobeissi continued, speaking on fellow bank UBS purchasing Credit Suisse and getting $100 billion in government liquidity.\n\n\u201cThe government said $CS had \u2018serious risk of bankruptcy.\u2019 A shareholder vote was bypassed.

        "content": "Coinbase\u2019s former CTO Balaji Srinivasan wagered on Friday that the price of Bitcoin will benefit from a rapid devaluing of the U.S. dollar in the next three months, skyrocketing to $1 million by June 17.\n\nSrinivasan entered a bet with two individuals that same day, ponying up $1 million with the pseudonymous Twitter pundit James Medlock and another unnamed person. If Bitcoin fails to notch what would be historic gains, the two would receive $1 million in Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin each.\n\nThe bet is part of Srinivasan\u2019s view that the global economy is teetering on the edge of rapid change, which he dubbed \u201chyperbitcoinization.\u201d He predicts the U.S. dollar will enter a point of rapid hyperinflation, and the global economy then \u201credenominates on Bitcoin as digital gold.\u201d\n\nIn this scenario, the market capitalization of Bitcoin\u2014already the largest token\u2014would increase to around $19.3 trillion from about $549 billion today, according to CoinGecko. For comparison, the value of the U.S. stock market was just over $40.5 trillion by the end of last year, according to Siblis Research.\n\nSrinivasan\u2019s prediction comes amid a series of bank failures in the U.S. that\u2019s injected fear and uncertainty into financial markets. And even though Bitcoin\u2019s correlation to stock indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq remains significant, some on Twitter are calling it the \u201cThe Great Decoupling\u201d given Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge past $28,000 as Wall Street wavers.\n\nThe bold bet inspired lengthy Twitter threads from some of crypto Twitter\u2019s most prominent voices, including Bitcoin entrepreneur and educator Jimmy Song and venture capitalist Adam Cochran, who delved into how realistic the prediction could be.\n\nReferencing the performance of cryptocurrencies during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, Cochran said that Bitcoin would need a catalyst more extreme than that to outdo the 547% rally seen from 2020 to 2022.\n\n3/25 The bet here, is that within 90 days, Bitcoin will reach a price of $1M USD. Or around a 3600% gain within the next 90 days. To put that in perspective, the rally from 2020 - 2022 was only 547% and the 2017 rally at far lower prices was only 1105% gain. pic.twitter.com/7OZZHXNgYX \u2014 Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) March 18, 2023\n\nStory continues\n\nCochran posited that a collapse of the United States and Europe\u2019s banking systems would ultimately overshadow the potential value of Bitcoin as an asset, making bunkers or beans a better use of money than purchasing the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cSimply put, stores of value or alternative assets do well when we doubt the profitability of an economic system and not the existence of a system,\u201d he told Decrypt via Twitter DM. \u201cIf the system doesn\u2019t exist, we shift down the hierarchy of needs, placing value on necessity goods, not valuables.\u201d\n\nCochran said Srinivasan\u2019s wager is a bid for hope in the crypto market after the industry faced tough sledding as crypto winter set in last year, a time when prices plummeted and numerous crypto firms collapsed. He noted that the digital assets industry lost a lot of the excitement and hope that brought people in.\n\n\u201cThey are hungry to have that back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just disappointing to see it fueled by an unrealistic bet in such a risky macro environment.\u201d\n\nOther voices, such as Song, appeared supportive of ideas expressed Srinivasan\u2019s bet, claiming Bitcoin could have some utility during an existential crisis for the financial system as it\u2019s known today.\n\n\u201cBitcoin will play a crucial role in mitigating some of the catastrophic effects,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a strictly limited currency, Bitcoin offers a much better store of value, dampening the impact of hyperinflation.\u201d\n\n5/\ud83c\udf10 Despite the daunting situation, Bitcoin will play a crucial role in mitigating some of the catastrophic effects. As a strictly limited currency, Bitcoin offers a much better store of value, dampening the impact of hyperinflation. \u2014 Jimmy Song (\uc1a1\uc7ac\uc900) (@jimmysong) March 19, 2023\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Matt Levine chimed in on Saturday to ask what could be considered a straightforward question: If Srinivasan thinks Bitcoin will reach $1 million in 90 days, why would he use the money to make a bet about it as opposed to just buying Bitcoin?\n\nthe replies are all \u201cno, he\u2019s printing a futures trade way above market to manipulate the price up\u201d which is not better \u2014 Matt Levine (@matt_levine) March 18, 2023\n\nLevine said in a subsequent Tweet that Srinivasan\u2019s move could be an attempt to \u201cmanipulate the price [of Bitcoin] up\u201d based on the replies he received. Others expressed the idea that Srinivasan could\u2019ve made the bet as a way to bring exposure to himself and Bitcoin.\n\nSrinivasan\u2019s net worth is estimated to be around $150 million, according to Datawallet. He had joined Coinbase after a company he co-founded called Earn.com\u2014which rewarded users with digital assets for completing small tasks\u2014was purchased by Coinbase.\n\nSrinivasan worked at Coinbase for around 14 months before leaving the exchange in May 2019. Among the accomplishments listed on his LinkedIn profile, he was responsible for organizing the \u201cbusiness and technical sides\u201d of Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin launch.\n\nSrinivasan is not the only person out there who has envisioned a $1 million price per Bitcoin. In January of last year, Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest estimated that Bitcoin could exceed $1 million by 2030, saying the network \u201cis likely to scale as nation-states adopt [Bitcoin] as legal tender.\u201d"

        "content": "There are plenty of military puns in operating system history.\n\nUnix famously has a whole raft of personnel known as Major Number, who organise the batallions of devices such as disk drives, keyboards and webcams in your system.\n\nMicrosoft once struggled with the apparently incompetent General Failure, who was regularly spotted trying to read your DOS disks and failing.\n\nLinux has intermittently has trouble with Colonel Panic, whose appearance is typically followed by lost data, potentially damaged file systems, and an urgent need to turn off the power and reboot your computer.\n\nAnd a Czech cryptocurrency company doesn\u2019t seem to be getting the sort of reliability you might reasonably expect from a personality called General Bytes.\n\nActually, General Bytes is the name of the company itself, a business that sadly is no stranger to unwanted intrusions and unauthorised access to cryptocurrency funds.\n\nOnce is misfortune\n\nIn August 2022, we wrote how General Bytes had fallen victim to a server-side bug in which remote attackers could trick a customer\u2019s ATM server into giving them access to the \u201cset up a brand new system\u201d configuration pages.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever reflashed an iPhone or an Android device, you\u2019ll know that the person who performs the original setup ends up with control over the device, notably because they get to configure the primary user and to choose a brand new lock code or passphrase during the process.\n\nHowever, you\u2019ll also know that modern mobile phones forcibly wipe the old contents of the device, including all of the old user\u2019s data, before they reinstall and reconfigure the operating system, apps, and system settings.\n\nIn other words, you can start again, but you can\u2019t take over where the last user left off, otherwise you could use a system reflash (or a DFU, short for device firmware upgrade, as Apple calls it) to get at the previous owner\u2019s files.\n\nIn the General Bytes ATM server, however, the unauthorised access path that got the attackers into the \u201cstart from scratch\u201d setup screens didn\u2019t neutralise any data on the infiltrated device first\u2026\n\n\u2026so the crooks could abuse the server\u2019s \u201cset up a new administrative account\u201d process to create an additional admin user on an existing system.\n\nTwice looks like carelessness\n\nLast time, General Bytes suffered what you might call a malwareless attack, where the criminals didn\u2019t implant any malicious code.\n\nThe 2022 attack was orchestrated simply through malevolent configuration changes, with the underlying operating system and server software left untouched.\n\nThis time, the attackers used a more conventional approach that relied on an implant: malicious software, or malware for short, that was uploaded via a security loophole and then used as what you might call an \u201calternative control panel\u201d.\n\nIn plain English: the crooks found a bug that allowed them to install a backdoor so they could get in thereafter without permission.\n\nAs General Bytes put it:\n\nThe attacker was able to upload his own Java application remotely via the master service interface used by terminals to upload videos and run it using batm user privileges.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure why an ATM needs a remote image-and-video upload option, as though it were some sort of community blogging site or social media service\u2026\n\n\u2026but it seems that the Coin ATM Server system does include just such a feature, presumbly so that ads and other special offers can be promoted directly to customers who visit the ATMs.\n\nUploads that aren\u2019t what they seem\n\nUnfortunately, any server that allows uploads, even if they come from a trusted (or at least an authenticated source) needs to be careful of several things:\n\nUploads need to be written into a staging area where they can\u2019t immediately be read back from outside. This helps to ensure that untrustworthy users can\u2019t turn your server into a temporary delivery system for unauthorised or inappropriate content via a URL that looks legitimate because it has the imprimatur of your brand.\n\nThis helps to ensure that untrustworthy users can\u2019t turn your server into a temporary delivery system for unauthorised or inappropriate content via a URL that looks legitimate because it has the imprimatur of your brand. Uploads need to be vetted to ensure they match the file types allowed. This helps stop rogue users from booby-trapping your upload area by littering it with scripts or programs that might later end up getting executed on the server rather than simply served up to a subsequent visitor.\n\nThis helps stop rogue users from booby-trapping your upload area by littering it with scripts or programs that might later end up getting executed on the server rather than simply served up to a subsequent visitor. Uploads need to be saved with the most restrictive access permissions feasible, so that booby-trapped or corrupt files can\u2019t inadverently be executed or even accessed from more secure parts of the system.\n\nGeneral Bytes, it seems, didn\u2019t take these precautions, with the result that the attackers were able to perform a wide range of privacy-busting and cryptocurrency-ripping actions.\n\nThe malicious activity apparently included: reading and decrypting authentication codes used to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges; sending funds from hot wallets; downloading usernames and password hashes; retrieving customer\u2019s cryptographic keys; turning off 2FA; and accessing event logs.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nIf you run General Bytes Coin ATM systems, read the company\u2019s breach report, which tells you how to look for so-called IoCs (indicators of compromise), and what to do while you wait for patches to be published.\n\nNote that the company has confirmed that both standalone Coin ATM Servers and its own cloud-based systems (where you pay General Bytes a 0.5% levy on all transactions in return for them running your servers for you) were affected.\n\nIntriguingly, General Bytes reports that it will be \u201cshuttering its cloud service\u201d, and insisting that \u201cyou\u2019ll need to install your own standalone server\u201d. (The report doesn\u2019t give a deadline, but the company is already actively offering migration support.)\n\nIn an about-turn that will take the company in the opposite direction to most other contemporary service-oriented companies, General Bytes insists that \u201cit is theoretically (and practically) impossible to secure a system granting access to multiple operators at the same time where some of them are bad actors.\u201d\n\nIf you have used a General Bytes ATM recently, contact your cryptocurrency exchange or exchanges for advice about what to do, and whether any of your funds are at risk.\n\nIf you are a programmer looking after an online service, whether it\u2019s self-hosted or cloud-hosted, read and heed our advice above about uploads and upload directories.\n\nIf you\u2019re a cryptocurrency enthusiast, keep as little of your cryptocoin stash as you can in so-called hot wallets.\n\nHot wallets are essentially funds that are ready to trade at a moment\u2019s notice (perhaps automatically), and typically require either that you entrust your own cryptographic keys to someone else, or temporarily transfer funds into one or more of their wallets."

        "content": "Mark Cuban told Bill Maher that buying gold is \u2018dumb\u2019 \u2014 and he wants bitcoin to plunge so he can buy even more. These are 3 simple ways to gain crypto exposure\n\nBeing a crypto bull has its challenges. Even though bitcoin has surged in 2023, it's still down more than 60% from its peak of $68,789 reached in November 2021.\n\nBut one billionaire investor still likes the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency: Mark Cuban.\n\nDon't miss\n\n\u201cI want Bitcoin to go down a lot further so I can buy some more,\u201d Cuban said in a recent episode of Bill Maher\u2019s Club Random podcast.\n\nMaher, who self-claims to be \u201cvery anti-bitcoin,\u201d owns gold instead. Cuban, conversely, has no time for the yellow metal.\n\n\u201cIf you have gold, you're dumb as f\u2014,\u201d says the Shark Tank star and Dallas Mavericks owner.\n\nMaher argues that gold \u201cis like a hedge against everything else\u201d but Cuban disagrees.\n\n\u201cGold is not a hedge against anything, right? What it is is a store of value and you don't own the physical gold, do you \u2026 Gold is a store of value and so is Bitcoin,\u201d Cuban explains.\n\nHe then points out why gold can\u2019t really protect your wealth in times of crisis.\n\n\u201cYou don't own the gold bar, and if everything went to hell in a handbasket and you had a gold bar, you know what would happen? Someone would beat the f\u2014 out of you or kill you and take your gold bar.\u201d\n\nIf you share Cuban\u2019s view, here are a few ways to gain exposure to bitcoin.\n\nBuy bitcoin directly\n\nThe first option is the most straightforward: If you want to buy Bitcoin, just buy Bitcoin.\n\nThese days, many platforms allow individual investors to buy and sell crypto. Just be aware that some exchanges charge up to 4% commission fees for each transaction. So look for apps that charge low or even no commissions.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Bitcoin commands a five-figure price tag today, there\u2019s no need to buy a whole coin. Most exchanges allow you to start with as much money as you are willing to spend.\n\nRead more: Here's how much money the average middle-class American household makes \u2014 how do you stack up?\n\nBitcoin ETFs\n\nExchange-traded funds have risen in popularity in recent years. They trade on stock exchanges, so buying and selling them is very convenient. And now, investors can use them to get a piece of the bitcoin action, too.\n\nFor instance, ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) started trading on NYSE Arca in October 2021, marking the first U.S. bitcoin-linked ETF on the market. The fund holds bitcoin futures contracts that trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and has an expense ratio of 0.95%.\n\nInvestors can also consider the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which made its debut a few days after BITO. This Nasdaq-listed ETF invests in bitcoin futures contracts and charges an expense ratio of 0.95%.\n\nBitcoin stocks\n\nWhen companies tie some of their growth to the crypto market, their shares can often move in tandem with the coins.\n\nFirst, there are bitcoin miners. The computing power doesn\u2019t come cheap and energy costs can be substantial. But if the price of bitcoin goes up, miners like Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Hut 8 Mining (HUT) are likely to receive increased attention from investors.\n\nThen there are intermediaries like Coinbase Global (COIN) and PayPal (PYPL). When more people buy, sell and use crypto, these platforms stand to benefit.\n\nFinally, there are companies that simply hold a lot of crypto on their balance sheets.\n\nCase in point: enterprise software technologist MicroStrategy (MSTR). It has a market cap of under $3 billion. Yet its bitcoin count reached approximately 132,500 as of Dec. 27, 2022, a stockpile worth around $3.4 billion.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $28,000 on March 21, but according to two derivatives metrics, traders aren\u2019t very ecstatic after a 36% gain in eight days. Looking beyond Bitcoin\u2019s stellar performance, there are reasons investors are not fully confident in further price upside. The recent rescue of Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old leading Swiss financial institution, is proof that the current global banking crisis might not be over.\n\nOn March 19, Swiss authorities announced that UBS had agreed to acquire rival Credit Suisse in an \u201cemergency rescue\u201d merger in order to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in the global banking sector. The transaction could benefit from more than $280 billion in state and central bank support, which is equivalent to one-third of Switzerland\u2019s gross domestic product. Unfortunately, there is no way to portray this agreement as reassuring or as a sign of strength from financial institutions, including central banks.\n\nThe same can be said for the emergency credit lifeline provided by the United States Treasury to protect the banking sector and increase Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reserves. The \u201cBank Term Funding Program\u201d (BTFP), launched on March 12, marked a return to Fed liquidity injections, reversing the trend initiated in June 2022, when the Federal Reserve began monthly asset sales.\n\nThe global banking crisis prompted the Fed to abandon its inflation-control policies\n\nBy lending $300 billion in emergency funds to banks, the Fed completely reversed its strategy to curb inflation, which has been above 5% year-over-year since June 2021, whereas the target is 2%. This strategy, known as tightening, included increasing interest rates and reducing the $4.8 trillion in assets the Federal Reserve accumulated from March 2020 to April 2022.\n\nOn March 20, First Republic Bank (FRB) saw its credit ratings downgraded further into junk status by S&P Global, adding to the stress on United States\u2019 regional banks. According to the risk agency, the lender\u2019s recent $30 billion deposit infusion from 11 large banks may not be enough to solve the FRB\u2019s liquidity problems.\n\nInvestors in cryptocurrencies are always anticipating a decoupling from the traditional markets. Nonetheless, there are few justifications for an allocation at the moment, especially if coming from corporations, mutual fund managers or wealthy investors. Historically, investors tend to hoard cash positions or short-term government debt instruments during recessionary periods in order to sustain day-to-day operations and possibly be used to purchase bargains.\n\nThe yield on six-month U.S. Treasurys, for example, decreased from 5.33% on March 9 to 4.80% on March 20. As investors prepare for the impact of inflation or a recession, or both, this development indicates a greater demand for short-term instruments. The change since March 9 reversed the entire movement from 2023, with the indicator closing 2022 at 4.77%.\n\nLet\u2019s examine Bitcoin derivatives metrics to determine the current market position of professional traders.\n\nBitcoin derivatives exhibit a balanced demand for long and short positions\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks, which typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement for a longer period.\n\nAs a result, futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5%\u201310% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as \u201ccontango,\u201d which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nSince March 15, the BTC futures premium indicator has remained unchanged at 2.2%, indicating no additional demand from leveraged buying activity. Numbers below 5% indicate pessimism, which is not what one would anticipate after price gains of 36% in eight days.\n\nThe absence of demand for leverage longs does not necessarily imply a price decline. As a result, traders should investigate Bitcoin\u2019s options markets to learn how whales and market makers value the likelihood of future price movements.\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign showing when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection. In bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 8%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -8%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nBitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nThe delta skew crossed the neutral -8% threshold on March 19, indicating moderate optimism as neutral-to-bullish call options were in higher demand. The excitement, however, did not last long, as the 25% skew indicator is currently at -8%, which is the edge of a balanced situation. Nonetheless, it is the polar opposite of the previous week, when the skew reached 12% on March 13.\n\nUltimately, professional Bitcoin traders are not bullish above $26,000. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but unless crypto investors regain confidence, the chances of the cryptocurrency surpassing $30,000 remain extremely remote. A complete breakdown of the banking system would cause investors to flee to safety rather than seek out risk.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Secure your seat today\n\nThis article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk\u2019s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nLatest Prices\n\nTop Stories\n\nBitcoin climbed 4% in the past 24 hours to above $28,000 for the first time since last June as some traders see the cryptocurrency as a hedge against the traditional banking system, which has had its share of troubles over the past few weeks, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and regulators' takeover of Signature Bank. On Sunday, the Federal Reserve announced it had joined with other major central banks to ensure a steady flow of the U.S. dollar, a dominant reserve currency, in the global financial system. Bitcoin was up 25% this month through Sunday.\n\nNon-crypto-related deposits held by former Signature Bank (now Signature Bridge Bank) will be assumed by Flagstar Bank, a subsidiary of New York Community Bancorp, as of Monday under a purchase and assumption agreement, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said in a press release on Sunday. Signature Bridge Bank depositors \u2013 other than depositors related to the digital banking business \u2013 will automatically become depositors of Flagstar, and will continue to be insured by the FDIC up to the insurance limit. Flagstar Bank's bid didn't include $4 billion of deposits related to the former Signature Bank's digital banking business.\n\nThe dollar value locked in the number of open bitcoin futures contracts is rising, signifying increased speculative interest in the market and potential for price volatility. Data from Coinglass shows the nominal value of open interest has reached a yearly high of $12 billion, marking a 7% gain for the month. An increase in open interest means new money is flowing into the market but doesn't reveal much about whether traders are getting in position for price gains or losses. In bitcoin's case, the new money seems to be betting on price gains, considering the funding rate or the cost of holding bullish long/bearish short positions has flipped into the green after spending most of the early parts of the Asian trading day in the red.\n\nStory continues\n\nChart of the Day\n\nThe chart shows bitcoin's rolling 30-day correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies.\n\nThe negative correlation has recently weakened amid U.S. bank failures that have complicated the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation.\n\nTrending Posts"

        "content": "Bitcoin ATM manufacturer General Bytes has shuttered its cloud services after discovering a \u201csecurity vulnerability\u201d that allowed an attacker to access users' hot wallets and gain sensitive information, such as passwords and private keys.\n\nThe company is based in Prague and according to its website has sold over 15,000 Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs to purchasers in over 149 countries all over the world.\n\nIn a March 18 patch release bulletin, the ATM manufacturer issued a warning explaining that a hacker has been able to remotely upload and run a Java application via the master service interface into its terminals aimed at stealing user information and sending funds from hot wallets.\n\nOn March 17-18th, 2023, GENERAL BYTES experienced a security incident.\n\n\n\nWe released a statement urging customers to take immediate action to protect their personal information.\n\n\n\nWe urge all our customers to take immediate action to protect their funds and https://t.co/fajc61lcwR\u2026 \u2014 GENERAL BYTES (@generalbytes) March 18, 2023\n\nGeneral Byes founder Karel Kyovsky in the bulletin explained this allowed the hacker to achieve the following:\n\n\u201cAbility to access the database.\n\nAbility to read and decrypt API keys used to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges.\n\nSend funds from hot wallets.\n\nDownload user names, their password hashes and turn off 2FA.\n\nAbility to access terminal event logs and scan for any instance where customers scanned private key at the ATM. Older versions of ATM software were logging this information.\u201d\n\nThe notice reveals that both General Bytes\u2019 cloud service was breached as well as other operators\u2019 standalone servers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve concluded multiple security audits since 2021, and none of them identified this vulnerability,\u201d Kyovsky said.\n\nHot wallets compromised\n\nThough the company noted that the hacker was able to \u201cSend funds from hot wallets,\u201d it did not disclose how much was stolen as a result of the breach.\n\nHowever, General Bytes released the details of 41 wallet addresses that were used in the attack. On-chain data shows multiple transactions into one of the wallets, resulting in a total balance of 56 BTC, worth over $1.54 million at current prices.\n\nGeneral Bytes released the details of 41 wallet addresses used in the attack. Source: General Bytes\n\nAnother wallet shows multiple Ether (ETH) transactions, with the total received amounting to 21.82 ETH, worth roughly $36,000 at current prices.\n\nCointelegraph reached out to General Bytes for comment and the company replied with a statement confirming the hack \u201cresulted in the loss of funds\u201d for some of their customers who used their cloud-hosted services.\n\n\u201cWe have taken immediate steps to prevent further unauthorized access to our systems and are working tirelessly to protect our customers,\" General Bytes said.\n\n\"We are refunding our cloud-hosted customers who have lost funds.\"\n\nAccording to the statement, the hack did not affect most ATM operators using self-hosted server installations because they use VPN technology to protect their infrastructure.\n\n\"We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience or harm caused and are taking swift action to address the situation,\u201d General Bytes said.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ATM decline: Over 400 machines went off the grid in under 60 days\n\nThe company has urgently advised BTC ATM operators to install their own standalone server and released two patches for their Crypto Application Server (CAS), which manages the ATM's operation.\n\nGeneral Bytes is a Bitcoin ATM manufacturer based in Prague that has sold over 15,000 ATMs worldwide. Source: General Bytes\n\n\u201cPlease keep your CAS behind a firewall and VPN. Terminals should also connect to CAS via VPN,\u201d Kyovsky wrote.\n\n\u201cAdditionally consider all your user\u2019s passwords, and API keys to exchanges and hot wallets to be compromised. Please invalidate them and generate new keys & password.\u201d\n\nGeneral Bytes previously had its servers compromised via a zero-day attack last September that enabled hackers to make themselves the default administrators and modify settings so that all funds would be transferred.\n\nUpdated March 28 with comments from General Bytes."

        "content": "Bitcoin is breaking free.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 3% rally in the last 24 hours has caught the eye of investors searching for a bright spot in a market roiled by banking chaos. Notably, the world\u2019s most valuable cryptocurrency is decoupling from stocks.\n\nIn the last seven days, it has soared 28% even as the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index eked out a 1.5% total return, according to data from CoinGecko and Morningstar.\n\nBitcoin has also performed twice as well as Ether, the native token for the Ethereum smart contracts network, which usually marches in lockstep with its bigger sibling.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nOver the last few years Bitcoin has closely tracked stocks, especially technology shares, as a \u201crisk on\u201d asset.\n\n\u201cExtra liquidity, that\u2019s the difference,\u201d between now and back when Bitcoin closely tracked higher risk assets such as the Nasdaq Composite Index, Markus Thielen, head of crypto research and strategy at Matrixport, told DL News.\n\n\u201cIt went risk-on when the Fed provided deposit guarantees and traders realised that liquidity would be pumped into the system,\u201d even as \u201csome parts of the economy are in stress,\u201d including banks, he said. \u201cThis is helping Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is surging (CoinMarketCap)\n\nFor quarter after quarter, cryptocurrency investors have been waiting for Bitcoin to deliver on its primary mission \u2013 to provide a reliable hedge against the machinations of central banks and the traditional financial system.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nNow, thanks to the banking crisis that started with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and engulfed the Swiss banking system over the weekend with UBS\u2019s emergency takeover of Credit Suisse, Bitcoin is finally coming through.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the crypto safe haven,\u201d said Philippe Bekhazi, the CEO of Stablehouse, a Bermuda-based trading and custody platform.\n\n\u2018The market is now pricing in that central banks will be cutting rates aggressively later this year.\u2019\n\nThis is largely due to Bitcoin\u2019s record as an unhacked blockchain, Bekhazi said. Even as numerous DeFi protocols have been plundered for billions of dollars in the last 12 months and \u201cecosystems\u201d such as Terra have cratered, the 14-year-old digital currency has chugged along with little drama.\n\nStill, the biggest knock on BTC has been its habit of mirroring the moves of stocks and responding to the Fed\u2019s fight to curb inflation with rising raising interest rates.\n\nA research study published by Georgetown University last July found that Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with the S&P 500 jumped 58% in 2021 and the first half of 2022.\n\nAnd an analysis by Fundstrat Global Advisors, a New York-based research boutique, concluded in 2022 that Bitcoin\u2019s correlation was running close to 1 with a Nasdaq index that tracks high-growth tech stocks.\n\nNOW READ: Bitcoin ignores macro moves, says the NY Fed. Experts disagree\n\nThis behaviour damaged Bitcoin\u2019s credibility as a form of \u201cdigital gold\u201d that could provide investors with a safe harbour during times of financial or geopolitical strife.\n\nNow Bitcoin may not just be providing relief to whipsawed investors, it\u2019s also a key indicator for what\u2019s to come as bank authorities race to stabilise the crisis.\n\n\u201cThe market is now pricing in that central banks will be cutting rates aggressively later this year,\u201d Juan Correa-Ossa, associate vice president for BCA Research, a provider of global macro research, told DL News. This tends to be positive for assets with no cash flow, such as Bitcoin and gold.\n\nBitcoin dominance\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin\u2019s share of the $1.2 trillion crypto market\u2019s capitalisation, a measure known as Bitcoin dominance, has jumped to 46% from 41% over the past 10 days while that of other major cryptocurrencies have remained flat or declined.\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, a European investment and trading group, said customers are increasingly seeing Bitcoin as a safe haven asset.\n\n\u201cGiven that the futures market has significantly shifted from anticipating a 50 to 75 basis point rate hike this year to potentially expecting 100 basis points of rate cuts (attributable to the banking crisis), this change has also been highly supportive of Bitcoin prices,\u201d he told DL News.\n\nAnother force to reckon with is counterparty risk. Correa-Ossa said that investors may be hedging against the risks of trading partners, or counterparties, which may be struggling to stay solvent. He cautioned that this applies to self-custodied Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering that Bitcoin was invented during the Great Financial Crisis bailouts,\u201d Correa-Ossa said."

        "title": "GBTC: The One Place to Buy Bitcoin for 58 Cents on the Dollar - Entrepreneur",
        "content": "The biggest Bitcoin closed-end fund trades at a deep discount to its assets, driven by nearly two years of hedge fund liquidations. Is GBTC turning the corner?\n\nThis story originally appeared on MarketBeat\n\nBitcoin is breaking out above its critical $25,000 level, which has been acting as stubborn upside resistance for the last nine months. Briefly trading above $27,000 on Friday morning, Bitcoin looks like it's trying to mount another bull trend.\n\nLike gold, Bitcoin is a proxy for skepticism of fractional reserve banking and fiat currency. With two large US banks failing this week as the government steps in to bail them out, it's no surprise that Bitcoin is rallying.\n\nAnd the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCMKTS: GBTC) is the most efficient way to play the Bitcoin rally. The trust trades at a whopping 42% discount to Bitcoin in the fund, which means you're buying Bitcoin for 58 cents on the dollar, and you can do it through your brokerage account.\n\nThere are also some exciting catalysts on the cusp for the fund, as Grayscale, the fund's manager, is in a court battle with the SEC to convert the trust into an ETF.\n\nWhat is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust?\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCMKTS: GBTC) is a publicly-traded fund that holds Bitcoin. The entire idea of the fund is to provide investors with a way to invest in Bitcoin without the compliance and custodianship concerns that come with buying and storing the actual crypto tokens.\n\nGBTC operates as a closed-end fund, similar to an ETF. Still, for some technical reasons, which we'll get into later, it can trade at substantial premiums or discounts to its net asset value (NAV), unlike an ETF. Throughout the fund's history, it has traded at a significant premium to its NAV due to its convenience and compliance.\n\nWhy Is It Trading at a Discount?\n\nAs a closed-end, GBTC lacks the built-in arbitrage mechanism that allows market makers to create and destroy shares at will to bring the fund's price in line with its net asset value. Between 2017 and 2021, this fact, combined with GBTC being the only avenue for institutional investors to access Bitcoin, led the fund to trade at a sustained premium.\n\nHistorically, GBTC at an average premium of about 20%.\n\nHedge funds capitalized on this premium by executing a straightforward arbitrage trade. They bought GBTC directly from Grayscale in a private placement, allowing them to purchase at NAV. However, there was a catch: they had to wait 6 months before selling the shares. As long as the premium persisted, the trade yielded considerable profits.\n\nBut investors won't pay a premium forever. Eventually, GBTC's premium to its Bitcoin holdings began to decline, creating losses for hedge funds, who, in many cases, borrowed lots of money to make the arbitrage trade.\n\nThe resulting margin calls led to a widespread liquidation of GBTC for over a year. However, the current deep discount offers a significant margin of safety, and two catalysts in play could close the discount.\n\nThree Catalysts to Close the Discount\n\nThe SEC Lawsuit: Vying for a Bitcoin ETF\n\nGrayscale has been trying to turn GBTC into an ETF for a long time, but the SEC continually turns them down. The fund manager is now suing the regulator after it rejected its application to convert GBTC into a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said the company was \"really encouraged\" after giving the DC Circuit Court of Appeals oral arguments.\n\nGBTC converting to a spot Bitcoin ETF would mean the fund would almost immediately start trading at its net asset value.\n\nShareholders Suing Grayscale\n\nA number of shareholders have been suing Grayscale to get the company to take action to close the fund's deep discount to its net asset value (NAV). Fir Tree Partners, a hedge fund, is in a legal battle with Grayscale.\n\nThe hedge fund claims that Grayscale prohibits redemptions of its fund for its gains and recommends that Grayscale initiate a tender offer to buy shares at net asset value.\n\nSuppose activist investors like Fir Tree can apply enough pressure on Grayscale. In that case, they might have to start acting to redeem some shareholder value.\n\nA Bitcoin Bull Market\n\nBitcoin has been on an aggressive rally to start the year. This month, it was given additional tailwinds with the spat of bank failures and government intervention in the financial system. Despite the bullish price action, the classic conditions of a Bitcoin hype train aren't in place yet, meaning the discount on Grayscale hasn't yet closed.\n\nIf Bitcoin continues to rally and the hype train returns, the GBTC discount will likely narrow."

        "content": "Leading Bitcoin ATM maker General Bytes disclosed that hackers stole cryptocurrency from the company and its customers using a zero-day vulnerability in its BATM management platform.\n\nGeneral Bytes makes Bitcoin ATMs allowing people to purchase or sell over 40 cryptocurrencies. Customers can deploy their ATMs using standalone management servers or General Bytes cloud service.\n\nOver the weekend, the company disclosed that hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability tracked as BATM-4780 to remotely uploaded a Java application via ATM's master service interface and run it with 'batm' user privileges.\n\n\"The attacker scanned the Digital Ocean cloud hosting IP address space and identified running CAS services on ports 7741, including the General Bytes Cloud service and other GB ATM operators running their servers on Digital Ocean (our recommended cloud hosting provider),\" General Bytes explained in a security incident disclosure.\n\nThe company took to Twitter to urge customers to \"take immediate action\" and install the latest updates to protect their servers and funds from attackers.\n\nAfter uploading the Java application, the threat actors gained able to perform the following actions on compromised devices:\n\nAbility to access the database.\n\nAbility to read and decrypt API keys used to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges.\n\nSend funds from hot wallets.\n\nDownload user names, their password hashes and turn off 2FA.\n\nAbility to access terminal event logs and scan for any instance where customers scanned private keys at the ATM. Older versions of ATM software were logging this information.\n\nGeneral Bytes warned that its customers and its own cloud service were breached during the attacks.\n\n\"GENERAL BYTES Cloud service was breached as well as other operator's standalone servers,\" highlights the statement.\n\nAlthough the company disclosed how much money the attacker stole, they provided a list of cryptocurrency addresses used by the hacker during the attack.\n\nThese addresses show that the hacker began stealing cryptocurrency from Bitcoin ATM servers on March 17th, with the attacker's Bitcoin address receiving 56.28570959 BTC, worth approximately $1,589,000, and 21.79436191 Ethereum, worth roughly $39,000.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin wallet still contains the stolen cryptocurrency, the threat actors appear to have used Uniswap to convert the stolen Ethereum into USDT.\n\nUpgrade servers now\n\nCAS (Crypto Application Server) admins are urged to examine their \"master.log\" and \"admin.log\" log files for any suspicious gaps in time caused by the attacker deleting log entries to conceal their actions on the device.\n\nGeneral Byte's report also warned that the uploaded malicious JAVA applications would appear in the \"/batm/app/admin/standalone/deployments/\" folder as random-named .war and .war.deployed files, as shown below.\n\nThe company notes that the file names are likely different per victim.\n\nFiles (red) dropped by the attacker on breached servers (General Bytes)\n\nThose without signs of a breach should still consider all their CAS passwords and API keys compromised and immediately invalidate them and generate new ones. All user passwords should also be reset.\n\nDetailed step-by-step instructions for all server operators on protecting their endpoints are enclosed in the company's statement.\n\nShuttering the cloud service\n\nGeneral Bytes says they are shuttering its cloud service, stating it finds it \"theoretically (and practically) impossible\" to secure it from bad actors when it must simultaneously provide access to multiple operators.\n\nThe company will provide support with data migration to those who would like to install their own standalone CAS, which should now be placed behind a firewall and VPN.\n\nGeneral Byte has also released a CAS security fix that addresses the exploited vulnerability, provided in two patches, 20221118.48 and 20230120.44.\n\nIt also highlights that the breached system underwent multiple security audits since 2021, but none identified the exploited vulnerability.\n\nFurthermore, researchers from the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange found multiple vulnerabilities in General Bytes' ATMs in 2021, which the company quickly fixed\n\nHowever, even with these security audits, in August 2022, General Bytes had a security incident where hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in its ATM servers to steal cryptocurrency from its customers.\n\nThe company says its plans to conduct numerous security audits of its products by multiple companies in a short period to discover and fix other potential flaws before bad actors find them."

        "content": "Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal believes that Balaji Srinivasan\u2019s bet on Bitcoin hitting $1 million within 90 days is a marketing trick.\n\nPal talked about crypto failures such as FTX, U.S. government\u2019s pushbacks against crypto, and Srinivasan\u2019s bet on Bitcoin hitting $1 million within 90 days.\n\nOn 20 March, entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano \u201cPomp\u201d invited Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal to his podcast, where he quizzed the latter on a range of topics surrounding Bitcoin [BTC] and its numerous run-ins with regulatory bodies.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cBitcoin and the 2023 Financial Crisis,\u201d Pal talked about crypto failures such as FTX, U.S. government\u2019s pushbacks against crypto, and former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan\u2019s bet on Bitcoin hitting $1 million within 90 days.\n\nRegarding the recent collapse of the crypto-friendly Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Pomp asked Pal if we should compare its collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in November last year. Pal pointed out that, though it\u2019s true that both institutions made poor investments. However, the crucial difference is that while SVB is a bank, FTX is only a brokerage. While SVB had the right, as a banking institution, to invest in customer funds, FTX had, as a crypto brokerage firm, no right to invest customer funds.\n\nPal also pointed out that even as banks have been disallowed from engaging in prop trading, FTX was doing essentially that with customer money.\n\nPomp asked Pal why the United States government was pushing against cryptocurrency. Pal responded that the U.S. government understands cryptocurrency and is acutely aware of the gigantic impact of possible bank runs as a potential result of Bitcoin\u2019s popularity. It is for this reason that the U.S. government is pushing back against mass adoption of cryptocurrency through bringing in a lot of rules and regulations.\n\nThe crypto industry has been dealing with multiple failures such as Terra [LUNA], Three Arrows Capital, Celsius, Voyager Digital and FTX since 2022. In addition, hacking attempts have continued to plague crypto platforms. Due to such incidents, customers have lost millions of dollars so far.\n\nPomp also asked Pal if the U.S. government will use the Reserve to buy Bitcoin to assuage market panic. Pal answered in the negative, saying that unlike the countries in the Middle-East, the U.S. government will not be buying Bitcoin as it is an extremely volatile asset.\n\nPal also pushed forward his own \u201ctheory\u201d that Satoshi Nakamoto is nobody but a state actor, which created Bitcoin as an alternative financial system just in case the mainstream banking system fails; in fact, these bodies already own Bitcoin, Pal proposed.\n\nCan Bitcoin hit $1 million?\n\nTowards the end of the podcast, Pal put worth his views on Balaji Srinivasan\u2019s bet on Bitcoin hitting $1 million within 90 days.\n\nPal said:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s [Srinivasan] has got 0.0% chance of being right.\u201d\n\nI will take that bet.\n\nYou buy 1 BTC.\n\nI will send $1M USD.\n\nThis is ~40:1 odds as 1 BTC is worth ~$26k.\n\nThe term is 90 days.\n\nAll we need is a mutually agreed custodian who will still be there to settle this in the event of digital dollar devaluation.\n\nIf someone knows how to do this\u2026 https://t.co/tcuBNd679T pic.twitter.com/6Aav9KeJpe \u2014 Balaji (@balajis) March 17, 2023\n\nSrinivasan believes that as traditional currencies enter a period of rapid hyperinflation, the global economy will turn to Bitcoin as digital gold as the new, preferred currency.\n\nPal said that it is Srinivasan\u2019s marketing trick to spread around the concept of hyper-bitcoinization. He, however, added that it could happen within 12 months but it\u2019s not appropriate to put a date, he cautioned."

        "title": "Wrapped Crypto: How Does wBTC Bring Deeper Liquidity to DeFi? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Interoperability is a difficult speed bump to overcome in the cryptocurrency industry. In the same way you can\u2019t install an Android app onto an iPhone, different blockchains can\u2019t recognize native assets from other networks. Fortunately, wrapped crypto tokens offer a simple solution.\n\nWrapped crypto tokens are a creative way to liberate cross-chain DeFi. By wrapping cryptocurrency, users can integrate their Bitcoin (BTC) with dApps in other ecosystems, like the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHow exactly do wrapped tokens work? What\u2019s the point of using my precious BTC on the Ethereum network?\n\nMore importantly, what are the risks associated with wrapped tokens?\n\nWhat are Wrapped Crypto Tokens?\n\nLike tourists dressing in local clothes on vacation, these digital assets enable users to \u2018wrap\u2019 a native token in a virtual package. In this way, the wrapped token can interact with its new environment. This is useful for crypto enthusiasts who want to use their on-chain digital assets in DeFi protocols on different networks.\n\nWrapped tokens are pegged to the value of their underlying asset. For example, if you wrap native BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain, you will receive an equivalent amount of wBTC on the Ethereum or the Binance Smart Chain.\n\n1 BTC = 1wBTC\n\n1 ETH = 1wETH\n\n1 BNB = 1wBNB\n\nGet the idea?\n\nWhile it\u2019s not officially a wrapped token, stablecoins like Tether (USDT) are, in many ways, the wrapped version of fiat currency. By providing $1,000 US dollars to Tether, you can mint 1000 USDT.\n\nWhat are the mechanics of this process?\n\nHow Does Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) Work?\n\nWrapped Bitcoin is the most common example of how wrapped crypto assets work. In its most basic description, wBTC is an ERC-20 token representing an equivalent value of 1 native BTC on the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThere are three different kinds of users within the wrapped bitcoin ecosystem. Custodians, merchants, and customers.\n\nCustodians\n\nThe Custodian is like a bank that holds native BTC assets. After receiving BTC, the custodian will mint an equivalent amount of wBTC. Custodians take care of BTC and wBTC assets and ensure they are backed and authenticated on-chain. BitGo is one of the most reputable custodians of BTC.\n\nThe Wrapped Bitcoin DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) decides who will be a trusted custodian of native Bitcoins.\n\nMerchants\n\nWrapped asset merchants regulate the distribution of wBTC. Merchants like Ren Protocol and Kyber are the means of exchange between the native Bitcoin blockchain and other networks.\n\nMerchants ensure that native BTC always backs wBTC at a 1:1 ratio by redeeming WBTC for BTC depending on customer supply and demand. This ensures that the Wrapped Bitcoin price is pegged to the same price as BTC.\n\nCustomers\n\nCustomers are regular end users of wBTC and BTC tokens, like traders and DeFi enthusiasts. It\u2019s worth mentioning that if you want to acquire wBTC, you don\u2019t need to request it through a merchant. Decentralized exchanges like UniSwap host liquidity pools you can easily trade with to buy wrapped assets.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Difference Between Ether (ETH) and Wrapped Ether (wETH)\n\nWhile it makes sense that native BTC tokens aren\u2019t compatible with Ethereum DeFi applications, wrapped Ether is less obvious. Ironically, native Ether is different from most tokens on the Ethereum network because ETH itself is simply for paying gas fees and securing the blockchain.\n\nThe ERC-20 token standard is a kind of cryptocurrency that can integrate and communicate with smart contracts, like trading and DeFi staking. Before we can unlock the capital efficiency of ETH, it needs to be wrapped into the ERC-20 standard. Token standards are like a set of rules and conditions that govern what a token can do on-chain.\n\nWhy Would I Want to Wrap my Cryptocurrency?\n\nWrapping your tokens is helpful because it lets you do more with your cryptocurrency. If you hold ten native BTC in a bitcoin wallet, there\u2019s not much you do with those assets on the bitcoin network apart from watching your portfolio swing with the market.\n\nHowever, if you wrap those crypto assets into a digital vault and deploy it on a different network, you can borrow against its value on a lending market like AAVE or trade it for wETH to buy NFTs on OpenSea. The full functionality of the Web3 world is at your fingertips.\n\nHowever, like anything in the cryptocurrency world, there are risks you need to take into account.\n\nPros\n\nWrapped crypto tokens let you move and store your digital assets across different blockchains.\n\nYou can use tokens like wBTC in DeFi applications to trade, stake, or borrow against their USD value.\n\nAlmost any digital asset can be wrapped. For example, XRP, PolkaDot, and Dogecoin can all be wrapped and minted on other networks.\n\nCons\n\nWrapping services are still fairly centralized. If a wBTC custodian collapses unexpectedly, it might be difficult to redeem wBTC. If wBTC can\u2019t be redeemed for BTC, it\u2019s effectively useless. This could destabilize the peg and devalue wBTC.\n\nIf the blockchain you\u2019ve wrapped tokens on suffers an outage, your tokens are stuck until the network restarts. Last time the Solana blockchain paused, millions of dollars worth of sBTC and Solana-wrapped USDC got periodically trapped.\n\nCan Traditional Stocks Be Wrapped Crypto Tokens?\n\nIn the same way cryptocurrency can be wrapped and deployed on the blockchain, traditional assets like gold and stocks can also be wrapped. DeFi applications like Poison Finance support tokenized stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla on their trading platform.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nWhile wrapped crypto tokens give you greater utility for your digital assets, you should be careful holding tokens on unreliable networks. Following the Harmony blockchain bridge exploit, stablecoins like USDC have lost all their value on the Harmony network and cannot be redeemed to other chains.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nWrapped assets are useful tools for DeFi enthusiasts and, when used strategically, can help optimize yield strategies and unlock deeper liquidity in your crypto holdings.\n\nFAQs"

Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization added $194 billion in 2023, representing a 66% gain year-to-date, outperforming Wall Street banks\u2019 stocks.\n\nBitcoin is up about 65% so far this year, versus the S&P 500\u2019s 2.5% gain and Nasdaq\u2019s 15% decline in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe momentum is all driven by liquidity, as bitcoin is an alternative liquidity vehicle,\u201d Markus Thielson, head of research and strategy at digital asset financial services firm Matrixport based in Singapore, told Reuters.\n\nBitcoin \u201ccan hit $45,000\u201d by year\u2019s end following the banking crisis\n\nHe expects bitcoin can hit $45,000 by the year\u2019s end, with liquidity from central banks finding its way into crypto assets, much as it did during 2021, when bitcoin scaled record heights.\n\nCredit Suisse was acquired by the UBS Group for nearly $2 billion on Sunday as part of emergency plans led by Swiss authorities to preserve the country\u2019s financial stability. As part of the agreement, the Swiss National Bank committed to providing over $100 billion in liquidity to UBS.\n\nThe $2 billion deal represents a considerable discount under Credit Suisse\u2019s market value on March 17 of nearly $8 billion, according to data from Companies Market Cap.\n\nCredit Suisse shareholders will be largely wiped out, receiving the equivalent of just 0.76 Swiss francs in UBS shares for stock that was worth 1.86 Swiss francs on Friday. Owners of $17 billion worth of \u201cadditional tier one\u201d bonds \u2014 a riskier class of bank debt \u2014 will lose everything, Swiss regulators said.\n\nChristine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, said she welcomed the \u201cswift action\u201d of the Swiss authorities.\n\nHer comments were echoed in the US, where Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Board chairman Jerome Powell both said the move supported \u201cfinancial stability\u201d.\n\nCredit Suisse had been losing the trust of investors and customers for years. In 2022, it recorded its worst loss since the global financial crisis.\n\nBut confidence collapsed last week after it acknowledged \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d in its bookkeeping and as the demise of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank spread fear about weaker institutions at a time when soaring interest rates have undermined the value of some financial assets.\n\nShares in the 167-year-old bank fell 25% over the week, money poured from investment funds it manages, and at one point account holders were withdrawing deposits of more than $10 billion per day, the Financial Times reported. An emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the bleeding."

Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nConcerns around congestion\n\nDespite its astounding rise, the Ordinals project has divided opinions in the crypto community with the BTC purists getting spooked by the idea of more network congestion, resulting in higher fees and slower transactions.\n\nTheir fears, though are not completely unfounded. At the time of writing, memory consumption per block exceeded the 300 MB limit by 366 MB, leading the blockchain to discard any transaction worth less than 3.07 sats/vB, or Satoshi per byte.\n\nHowever, more than 30,000 transactions were yet to be confirmed, indicating that the network slowed down considerably."

        "content": "Amid several bank collapses, the Bitcoin price exceeds US$27,000\n\nCryptocurrency prices are skyrocketing in the wake of the high-profile Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s collapse. Considering that, unlike stocks, cryptocurrencies are typically not backed by any tangible assets or operating cash flow of an underlying corporation, cryptocurrencies are among the riskiest potential trading. Hence, one might anticipate a decline in cryptocurrency if a lack of trust affects the markets. Conversely, the top cryptocurrency Bitcoin price increased after it was revealed that the U.S. government was insuring almost all deposits at the failing California bank and that depositors would receive their whole money back. As of writing the Bitcoin price exceeds US$27,000.\n\nBitcoin increased by 23% in a single week, and it recently reached its greatest levels in months, supporting the idea that it can act as a buffer against instability in the established financial system. Similar to many growth stocks, cryptocurrency is a hazardous asset that fluctuates based on changes in the direction of interest rates in the future. Trading tends to migrate into riskier assets when rates fall, but away from risky assets when rates increase. They now anticipate that the Fed\u2019s rate rises would decrease, if not come to an end entirely, from their ferocious pace of the previous year.\n\nWhile some regard this as a short-term rise, it appears that a larger price action is on the horizon. As is well known, Bitcoin is approaching the halving that takes place once every four years. The next halving is planned for 2024, while the previous one took place in 2020. It is clear from looking at price trends since the start that cryptocurrency is behaving similarly before and after the halving event. The price has so reached a pivotal point beyond which it has before experienced a significant increase.\n\nThe monthly chart above depicts how the BTC price has tracked a comparable price movement since 2014. The BTC price breaks its bullish grip after each halving and plunges precipitously to indicate the cycle\u2019s bottom. The price then experiences a noticeable bounce that sparks a tremendous upswing that drives it higher to set a new record high. Every time the price has halved, this pattern has appeared, and once the price crosses above the trend line, a similar rise is anticipated. Yet, future forecasts suggest that Bitcoin will continue to gain momentum for some future period. According to projections from a cryptocurrency exchange, the price of Bitcoin could reach about $30,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nIn addition, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) both experienced weekly gains of about 9.88% and 12%, correspondingly. The market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is $1.16 trillion, up 0.02% from yesterday.\n\nOn a larger scale, the price of BTC has done well, rising by more than 35% in the last seven days to trade at $27,340. The cryptocurrencies do not, however, seem to have fully tapped into the strength they have built up over the last few months. It\u2019s interesting to note that compared to Bitcoin, the growth of popular cryptocurrencies has increased less recently. So, taking into account the existing circumstances, it can be predicted that the price of Bitcoin (BTC) will continue to have a significant lead and may increase until it reaches its goal.

        "content": "CoinReporter's Interview with Harley Simpson from Foxify on Regulations, CBDC Innovations, and Their Unique Platform\n\n\"When it comes to long-term potential, we're already seeing some of it play out with major players like Fidelity and BlackRock getting involved in the space, even if not directly with Bitcoin. While we're currently experiencing a challenging regulatory environment in the US, I believe that once the regulations are in place, larger institutions will enter the market. This will lead to mass adoption and decreased volatility over time, ultimately highlighting Bitcoin's great potential.\n\nAs for the impact of regulation on the blockchain industry, it's true that regulations could slow down the development of smaller projects, as the barrier to entry may become more difficult to navigate. However, in the long term, tighter regulations could lead to a decrease in scams and fraudulent activities, ultimately benefiting the industry.\n\nWhen considering the impact of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) on the crypto market, it really depends on how they are used. If CBDCs can be easily integrated with existing crypto wallets and platforms, they could help people become more comfortable with digital currencies. However, it may take some time for this growth to materialize.\n\nFocusing on the use case of Foxify, our company has developed a unique peer-to-peer trading platform. Instead of relying on a centralized market maker, users can create their own trades and find counterparts directly on the platform. This approach empowers retail traders and fosters a fair and transparent trading environment.\n\nOur platform is decentralized, with funds held in a smart contract rather than by the company. This ensures that transactions are secure, and it operates in a manner similar to other decentralized applications. As for the security of transactions on our platform, it is as secure as a typical Web3 wallet, provided there are no malicious elements in the smart contract. The technical details may be complex, but users can have confidence in the security of their trades on our platform. \"\n\n\"The Only Guarantee in Crypto Is Risk\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShare this article:"

        "title": "Srinivasan's Balaji Dreamed Of Bitcoin Reaching 1 Million US Dollars Per BTC, Mr. Whale Invites Realistic Thoughts - VOI English",
        "content": "JAKARTA - The failure of a number of leading US banks some time ago is said to have exacerbated US dollar inflation and rocked the traditional banking system. This condition raises speculation regarding the increase in Bitcoin prices that are predicted to be future money.\n\nAccording to Balaji Srinivasan, a venture capital investor and former CTO Coinbase, said that high inflation is happening right now. He estimates the price of bitcoin will soon reach 1 million US dollars (or around Rp. 15.3 billion) per BTC.\n\nBalaji set a multimillion dollar bet that it would happen within 90 days. Srinivasan also advised investors to buy bitcoins, which he trusts as \"protection from high inflation, weakening currencies, bank freezes, and confiscation of wealth.\"\n\nAccording to Srinivasan, high inflation is happening right now. He pointed to government and Federal Reserve assistance to Bank's Silicon Valley and Signature Banks. In comparison, he explained that the largest cryptocurrency might have a role like gold as a protection against \"standard\" inflation, but it took years to prove.\n\nBitcoin Bet\n\nSrinivasan also set a $1 million stake with James Medlock that the US will not experience high inflation within 90 days. Srinivasan asked Medlock to buy 1 bitcoin, while he would deliver $1 million.\n\nIf BTC is less than USD 1 million within 90 days of the crowd, then Medlock wins, but if the price of BTC is more than USD 1 million within 90 days of the crowd, then Srinivasan wins.\n\nAlthough Srinivasan estimates the increase in bitcoin prices, these prices can fluctuate and drop suddenly. Bitcoin price fluctuations are influenced by various factors such as demand and market offerings, government regulations, technology adoption, and security issues. Therefore, investors must remain careful and do research before buying bitcoin.\n\nBe Realistic\n\nHowever, there were other comments from Mr. Whale's Twitter account regarding Balaji Srinivasan's statement. Mr. Whale, a crypto observer with more than 500,000 followers, said he thought Srinivasan's comments only confirmed that we were in the bearish market. He also added that Srinivasan was wrong in predicting the price of bitcoin which would reach one million dollars, and that prediction differed by a few zeros.\n\nHowever, Mr. Whale also stated that he believes the price of bitcoin will never reach All-Time High (ATH) again, and will drop below 10 thousand dollars by the end of this year. He added that let's be realistic, bitcoin fails to do what it should.\n\nI think his comments just further confirm we're in a bear market. He is off by several zeros.We will never hit ATHs again, and be at sub 10K later this year. Let's be realistic, Bitcoin failed at everything it was supposed to do. \u2014 Mr. Whale (@WhaleWire) March 19, 2023\n\nHe also assessed that the increase in the price of Bitcoin could not be separated from the parties who manipulated one of them was the publisher of the USDT stablecoin, Tether. \"Let's thank Tether and the corrupt fraudster for that! Bitcoin will be under $100 if they don't manipulate the price, don't deceive yourself,\" Mr. Whale commented.\n\nEven so, there are different opinions about the future of bitcoin and the price it will achieve. Some believe that bitcoin can protect against inflation and can reach a very high price, while others are skeptical and even reject that view.\n\nThis shows that investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin has a fairly high risk and requires careful assessment and analysis before making transactions. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at IDR 428 million per coin. Data from Coingecko shows that BTC has increased by 15.1 percent in the past week.\n\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.

        "content": "As cryptocurrency continues to grow, so does its demand for being accepted as payment, especially within the digital world. In this day and age, it\u2019s quite surprising that so few online betting sites accept it. Below, we will discuss the top three different online betting sites that offer Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies!\n\nTake Advantage of ONWIN\u2019s Amazing Odds Using Crypto!\n\nONWIN is still new to the scene, and though it\u2019s yet to stand the test of time, this platform has gained a mass following and is already presenting itself as a serious threat to other online betting sites in the industry. Their main demographic is based in Brazil, which is unsurprising given that the world of online sports betting is more popular there than in any other country. In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, ONWIN also accepts other cryptos too, such as USDT and BNB.\n\nHowever, welcoming cryptocurrency as a payment method is only a fraction of the desirable features ONWIN offers. The main reason the site has attracted so much attention in so little time is down to their incredible and unprecedented betting odds. ONWIN also offers some other fun and interesting features such as eSports betting, Casino betting, and live sports betting! They have been praised for their awesome bonus deals and Sports betting promotions. Newcomers get a 100% welcome bonus for Bingo and $100 worth of bets!\n\nCrypto in Return for Loyalty\n\nBwin has been around for more than 15 years and has since become a top-class booker maker and a public favorite in the world of online betting. Bwin\u2019s fan-base claims they are the perfect choice for punters looking for a platform that offers a wide range of sports, fast payouts, and impeccable betting odds. In terms of complaints, many customers have requested that Bwin launch a live chat service.\n\nThey also offer a good range of payment options, which is what we\u2019re highlighting here. They use \u201cpay with crypto,\u201d which is a payment method that allows customers to deposit their money into their Bwin account. Then, through BVNK, a third-party virtual assets service provider, they provide them with a fixed exchange rate for an hour and convert their cryptocurrency into euros. There is a small catch, which is that paying in crypto is exclusive to customers that have been using the platform for over three months.\n\nGet A Weekly Crypto Allowance with Stake.com\n\nStake.com is an online betting site that advertises itself as a \u201ccrypto casino & sports betting\u201d platform. It\u2019s best known for offering a high RTP (percentage return to player) and lots of unrestricted weekly and monthly bonuses. In addition, all users of their platform get a weekly allowance of 5-10 dollars.\n\nThe cons? Since Stake.com is a cryptocurrency betting site, there is currently no means of withdrawal into traditional fiat money, but considering the rising number of customers strictly choosing to gamble with crypto, there\u2019s a huge market for what their offering.\n\nFor More Information on ONWIN, Click On the Links Below!\n\nWebsite: Onwin.com\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/on_win\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_OnWin_\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

It is not a recommendation to trade.\n\nSince its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has dominated the crypto market. It has grown to become a mainstream asset class that attracts a wide variety of investors and turns over billions of dollars in daily trading volume.\n\nHowever, over the past few years, many other digital assets, known as altcoins, have emerged and gained significant popularity, eating away at Bitcoin's share of the total crypto marketcap \u2013 otherwise known as Bitcoin dominance.\n\nThis was witnessed at the highest degree during the 2021-2022 bull run when many coins and tokens rallied upwards of 1,000%. While BTC made new highs during this time, its returns were far less, causing a drastic drop in its dominance percentage.\n\nThe question on many people's minds is when will altcoins once again have their moment in the sun?\n\nThis article will explore the concept of Bitcoin dominance, its role in market cycles and the factors that could help indicate the dawn of a new altcoin season.\n\nIdentifying market cycles\n\nWhile markets are viewed by many as moving up or down - bullish or bearish - they often move in distinct long-term phases, known as cycles.\n\nMarket cycles are characterised by 4 phases \u2013 accumulation, markup, distribution and markdown.\n\nWhile there's no fixed or definitive timeline, the patterns typically remain the same. Identifying these patterns can help you enter during an accumulation or markup phase and amplify your long-term profit potential.\n\nAlthough price cycles are a result of money flowing in and out of the market, these fluctuations are primarily driven by market psychology \u2013 fear, greed and cognitive biases.\n\nMarket psychology plays an important role in identifying entries and exits and is explained in depth in the Binance Academy article - The Psychology of Market Cycles.\n\nBitcoin dominance on the rise\n\nBitcoin dominance is a key metric used by investors to help determine where we are in the market cycle and plan entries and exits accordingly.\n\nThis percentage value is calculated as follows:\n\nBTC marketcap / Total crypto marketcap * 100\n\nAt the time of writing, the combined marketcap of all cryptocurrencies is US $1.15 trillion, while Bitcoin's marketcap is US $530.5 billion.\n\nThis means that Bitcoin's dominance is currently sitting at 47.28%.\n\nBy monitoring Bitcoin's dominance percentage, investors can gain insight into market trends and identify potential opportunities.\n\nIn the past, traders have used this metric to help identify when money is flowing out of Bitcoin and into lower marketcap trading pairs. Recognising this change allowed these savvy investors to diversify their portfolios at the right time and gain early entry to altcoin season and the high returns that followed.\n\nBinance Guide: What Is Binance BTCDOM Index\n\nAltcoin season: How to plan your investments\n\nIn the past, altcoin season has come in various trends, including DeFi summer, the NFT boom and the Metaverse hype.\n\nWhile the coins and tokens may differ each cycle, altcoins season is typically characterised by a significant drop in Bitcoin's dominance percentage and the rallying of lower marketcap trading pairs.\n\nWe spoke to Liam O'Doherty from Binance Australia to get his thoughts on where we are in the current market cycle and what Bitcoin's current dominance of 47.28% might mean moving into the second quarter of 2023.\n\n\"When markets rally, major traders will look for better returns than Bitcoin (BTC). During these periods, they'll often trade between BTC and altcoins (instead of fiat or stablecoins) to take advantage of the overall market movement. When BTC rallies, a rally in altcoins often follows as traders use new profits to seek further gains in alts.\"\n\nWhile it's impossible to predict the exact timing of the next altcoin season, Liam raises a good point. After a shaky 2022, Bitcoin has shown strength in the early stages of 2023.\n\nThe 'king of crypto' has gained about 10% in the past 2 months, leading to a rise in its dominance percentage, with many traders turning to Binance to utilise the platform's zero spot trading fees across 13 Bitcoin spot pairs.\n\nAlthough BTC has a long way to go before reaching its previous all-time highs, investors who purchased at 2022 lows may look to take profits and diversify into lower marketcap altcoins.\n\nThis diversification was witnessed during the 2021 bull run when altcoins such as BNB (the native coin of Binance exchange and BNB Chain) saw exponential growth. Over the course of about 6 months, BNB gained 2,442% while BTC rose 284%.\n\nIt's important to remember that past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nDuring the 2021 altcoin season, Bitcoin's dominance percentage dropped below 40% as profits were taken and investors diversified their portfolios into high-performing alternatives.\n\nPiecing the puzzle together\n\nWhile understanding market cycles and tracking Bitcoin dominance can help you identify when an altcoin season is approaching, it's also important to watch the development progress and roadmap of some of your favourite projects.\n\nLiam from Binance agreed that the crypto space can be overwhelming and full of speculation. It's probably best to stay away from speculative and high-risk investments and focus on the fundamentals.\n\n\"To see a true alt season, you want to see a surge in development of tech.\"\n\nProjects that are reaching their goals and helping to push the limits of blockchain technology are the ones that will most likely perform well over the long term.\n\nThere's no set formula for predicting or trading the market \u2013 it's crucial to do your own research (DYOR) and consider your risk appetite before investing. Always follow a trading or investment plan and conduct due diligence in research through reputable sources such as Binance Academy.\n\nMarketcap vs price: thinking about when to buy One of the most important metrics to consider when planning your crypto investments is market capitalisation or simply marketcap. Marketcap refers to the total valuation of a cryptocurrency project. This value can be calculated by multiplying the price of an asset by its circulating supply of tokens or coins. For example, a project with 1 million tokens worth $10 each has the same marketcap as a project with 10 million tokens worth $1 each. Not understanding this can lead beginner investors to purchase cryptos based on their token price or because it's 'cheap' compared to the price of one Bitcoin. Some low-priced cryptos, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), are highly valued, with multi-billion dollar marketcaps. However, expecting these to reach a price of $10 per token is extremely unlikely and would lead to a total marketcap in the trillions \u2013 much higher than Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer: This information should not be interpreted as an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering.

        "content": "The recent upturn in the cryptocurrency market, led by the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset Bitcoin (BTC), has given wings to Bitcoin mining companies\u2019 stocks, as their price in terms of weekly performance is recording substantial gains.\n\nSpecifically, the surge in the BTC price has resulted in most Bitcoin mining companies posting stock price increases, according to the recent information shared by the cryptocurrency market data aggregation and analytics platform CryptoRank on March 20.\n\nBitcoin mining stocks advance\n\nAs the chart indicates, the Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) stock has climbed 75.8% over the past week, followed by Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) with a 53.3% increase, Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT) at 52.8%, Hut 8 Mining (TSE: HUT), which has gained 49.2%.\n\nFurthermore, other blockchain stocks involved in Bitcoin mining that have recorded significant weekly gains include Digithost Technology (CVE: DGHI) at 43%, HIVE Blockchain (CVE: HIVE) at 29.8%, Bit Digital (NASDAQ: BTBT) at 27%, Core Scientific (OTCMKTS: CORZQ) at 26.3%, Argo Blockchain (LON: ARB) at 24.4%, and Bitfarms (TSE: BITF) at 23.9%.\n\nBitcoin and mining stocks weekly performance. Source: CryptoRank\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time changing hands at the price of $28,256, demonstrating an increase of 0.12% on the day, 3.80% across the previous week, and 26.20% on its monthly charts, as per the latest data retrieved by Finbold from the crypto tracking platform CoinMarketCap.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nAs it happens, the latest bullish rally in the crypto industry arrives as the banking sector is struggling with multiple large-scale collapses amid a crisis threatening to engulf more financial institutions, which has led some Bitcoin advocates to suggest buying more of the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization.\n\nAt the same time, a long-term Bitcoin critic and CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, Peter Schiff, has predicted that the world would eventually shift from fiat to digital currencies due to the dollar\u2019s rapid devaluation, but he does not believe BTC will be one of them, as Finbold reported earlier.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Amid a widespread financial crisis that has seen multiple banking giants collapse and more at risk, Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund manager, believes that this situation could further strengthen the power of Bitcoin (BTC) as well as the cryptocurrency market as a whole.\n\nDue to this declining trust in banks and people fleeing into alternative systems, becoming aware of their benefits amid crises, Pal believes that the crypto industry and Bitcoin could explode in the future, closely resembling the chart patterns from 2013, as he explained in an interview with Anthony Pompliano published on March 20.\n\n\u201cI think there is a potential setup here for Bitcoin and the whole crypto market actually, to be shockingly strong, more like in 2013 than 2019 [when] we had that big correction (\u2026) partially due to the G5 central banks\u2019 balance sheets that were contracting over that period of time, and it pulled back the crypto market.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Pal, who retired from his position at the age of 36, said that he got into Bitcoin in 2013 because he realized there was no trust in the banking system after the financial ruin of the investment banking company Lehman Brothers.\n\n\u201cWhen you realize that, in a bank, you don\u2019t actually own your money, and people are now realizing that, and the Treasury and the FED are like \u2018well, we\u2019ll just pretend that\u2019s okay,\u2019 that drives people into this parallel financial system. I got into Bitcoin in 2013 for exactly this reason and have been an active participant in the market ever since.\u201d\n\nCrypto and Bitcoin explosion\n\nThe former hedge fund boss did admit that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility was what made people skeptical about its ability to act as a wealth preservation asset \u201cbecause, in people\u2019s minds, the time horizon is too short.\u201d However, \u201cif you hold it long enough, it does extremely well, it does better than the FED balance sheet, better than any other asset in existence.\u201d\n\nPal also expects there would be \u201ca gigantic pushback from the government as more people move out of the system and into the Bitcoin market,\u201d but if the United States fails to understand that people have \u201cawoken to the fact that there is another way out of this,\u201d many crypto companies could move to the United Kingdom.\n\nWatch the entire video below:\n\nFeatured image via Real Vision Finance YouTube."

        "content": "As Credit Suisse (SWX: CSGN) becomes another banking giant to feel the effects of the widespread crisis that has already crashed several financial institutions and put many others at risk, it is worth reminding of the words of its former CEO, who claimed Bitcoin (BTC) was a bubble.\n\nIndeed, the former Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam was skeptical about Bitcoin, arguing that the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset was \u201cthe very definition of a bubble,\u201d the anonymity of which presented a challenge, as he stated at a press conference back in November 2017.\n\n\u201cFrom what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell Bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he claimed that the use of Bitcoin in criminal activities was another challenge for the cryptocurrency and that banks were disinterested in getting involved with \u201ca currency which has such anti-money laundering challenges.\u201d However, banks jumping on the crypto train later proved Thiam wrong.\n\nCredit Suisse struggles\n\nIronically, not only did the interest in Bitcoin increase since Thiam said those words, but now his former employer, Credit Suisse, is struggling, and it had to be rescued by Switzerland\u2019s biggest bank, UBS. Early optimism about the deal soon deflated, and both CS and UBS shares plummeted.\n\nSeveral days before, Credit Suisse stock saw a substantial increase upon the announcement that the bank had intended to borrow over $54 billion from the Swiss central bank, as Finbold reported on March 16. However, things have taken a turn for the worse since then.\n\nIt is worth noting that, shortly before the UBS acquisition of Credit Suisse, renowned economist Nouriel Roubini warned that the bank might be too big to fail but also too big to be saved, while Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the best-selling personal finance book \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad,\u201d had (correctly) predicted that more banks could come crashing down."

        "title": "Is Bitcoin Following An Explosive 1970s Gold Fractal? | Bitcoinist.com - Bitcoinist",
        "content": "Bitcoin price could potentially be following a fractal from gold during the 1970s \u2013 the last time inflation in the United States got out of control.\n\nWhat followed was a more than 700% rally in the precious metal. Will the same happen in digital gold?\n\nBitcoin Follows Price Fractal From 1970s Gold\n\nOver the last week, both Bitcoin and gold have rallied in the wake of widespread bank runs and failures. Gold is up roughly 10% on the year, while BTC is near a 70% return.\n\nWith bank shares plummeting and the top cryptocurrency by market cap rising, BTC priced in banks makes for some of the most shocking and awe-inspiring price charts you could imagine.\n\nThat shock and awe might continue, if a fractal BTC is following from 1970s gold continues to unfold. In the 1970s, the United States inflation rate reached over 10% and double-digits wasn\u2019t uncommon through the early 80s.\n\nDuring the worst of it, gold went on to climb more than 750% from $100 to $850 per troy ounce of the precious metal. Now that same price fractal is potentially back in Bitcoin, and so is soaring inflation.\n\nBitcoin today versus 1970s gold | BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe Fastest Horse In The Race Against Inflation\n\nDuring the 2020 bull run, billionaire investor and philanthropist Paul Tudor Jones famously said that Bitcoin could be the fastest horse in the race against inflation, referencing 1970s gold.\n\nInflation had first reached double-digits in 1974, only three years after US President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would no longer be convertible from dollars to gold at a fixed price of $35 per ounce.\n\nGold went parabolic, first experiencing a pullback in 1974 when inflation got overheated. After a two-year long correction, gold spent the next several years rallying by more than 750%.\n\nBitcoin price also corrected hard when inflation first reared its head, but after two years is starting to show resilience. In the future, it could prove to be the digital equivalent to gold in the 1970s, helping investors beat inflation or a banking crisis.\n\nIn the price fractal above, gold completed a wave 5 after an expanded flat correction, according to Elliott Wave Principle. In commodities markets, wave 5s tend to be extended. With BTC being classified by the SEC and CFTC as a commodity, could the crypto asset perform similarly?\n\nIf BTCUSD were to follow the same path with a 750% return from recent lows, it would ultimately take Bitcoin to over $132,000 per coin. Could this be what\u2019s ahead for the first-ever cryptocurrency?\n\nIn Elliott Wave Principle, commodity wave 5s are the longest and strongest. With #Bitcoin labeled a commodity by the SEC and CFTC, will it exhibit such commodity-like market behavior?

        "content": "The value of Bitcoin (BTC) has been rising in 2023, with the asset targeting new levels despite the prevailing impact of the banking crisis. With recent gains, the future price of Bitcoin is in focus, as investors monitor whether the gains will hold.\n\nIn this regard, Finbold leveraged CoinCodex\u2019s self-learning machine platform to determine Bitcoin\u2019s price during Easter 2023. According to the platform, Bitcoin\u2019s momentum is likely to stagnate, and it might trade at $27,845 on Easter day, April 9, according to data retrieved on March 19.\n\nThe estimated price of Bitcoin represents gains of about 2% from the cryptocurrency\u2019s valuation at the time of publishing.\n\nBitcoin one-month price prediction. Source: CoinCodex\n\nIt is worth noting that Finbold previously reported that another AI-based tool, CoinPriceForecast, indicated that Bitcoin is likely to reclaim $30,000 by the end of the year. The platform estimates that BTC will trade at $33,047 at the end of 2023.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was trading at $27,324 after days of sustained capital inflow. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin has gained by over 30%, despite slightly correcting by about 1% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of $526.8 billion.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAlthough Bitcoin has slightly corrected, crypto trading expert and analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, in a tweet on March 18, remained optimistic about BTC\u2019s prospects in the short term.\n\n\u201cJust like previously asked on Bitcoin, we got the answer now as well. Are we staying above $26,800? The answer is clear; yes. This means the trend will continue to last until $26,800 is lost. Looking for a final sweep into $28,300-28,900 and then reversal,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nElsewhere, Bitcoin\u2019s one-week technical analysis retrieved from TradingView is dominated by a bullish outlook. A summary and moving averages of the gauges recommend a \u2018strong buy\u2019 sentiment at 16 and 12, respectively.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin fundamentals\n\nBitcoin\u2019s momentum has translated into a growing belief that the asset is experiencing a change in its narrative due to the ongoing banking crisis. Despite this, the value of the cryptocurrency continues to be greatly affected by inflation and Federal Reserve rate increases.\n\nWith the inflation data showing slowed growth, the chances of increasing interest rates are diminishing, an aspect that is likely to act as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin to possibly reclaim the $30,000 position.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
