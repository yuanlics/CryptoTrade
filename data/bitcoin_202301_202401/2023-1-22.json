        "content": "Has bitcoin historically enhanced portfolio returns?\n\nFidelity found that bitcoin boosted a portfolio's returns during specific periods in the past, though it also came with substantial volatility.\n\nFrom August 1, 2010 (when monthly pricing for bitcoin first became available) to August 31, 2022 (the study's defined end date), bitcoin generated average annual returns of 186.7%. Note that a significant portion of these gains were made in the early days of trading, which may have experienced more volatility than it will see going forward.\n\nIn 2018, the bitcoin futures market launched, which enhanced pricing efficiency and brought in new market participants. Since that time, bitcoin has generated average annual returns of roughly 8.8%.\n\nOf course, it's important to note that past performance is no guarantee of future results. Bitcoin is an emerging asset that comes with extreme volatility. Investors should keep in mind that its value has both the potential to significantly increase or decline in the future, as year-to-date performance has shown.\n\nTo help analyze bitcoin's risk, Fidelity ran a simulation that added varying amounts to a traditional 60/40 portfolio (i.e., a mix of 60% stocks and 40% bonds). This was based on historical performance of all assets from January 1, 2018 (after the first bitcoin futures contracts started trading) to August 31, 2022. The goal was to evaluate the proportion of risk bitcoin would account for if it replaced part of the stock portion, bond portion, or equal amounts of both stocks and bonds.\n\nThe study found that even a small allocation of bitcoin meaningfully increased volatility, which includes both increases and decreases in simulated prices. For example, replacing 1% of the stock or bond portion (or 0.5% from each) with bitcoin contributed about 3% of the portfolio's overall volatility. The study also found that the risks increase exponentially. Replacing 5% of the stock portion, or 2.5% from both stocks and bonds, with bitcoin contributed 21% of portfolio volatility."

        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nThomas Trutschel | Photothek | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin continued its climb Monday as traders took news of another crypto bankruptcy in their stride and placed bets on a Federal Reserve \"pivot\" to cutting interest rates. The price of the No. 1 token briefly topped $23,100 Monday, after touching $23,333.83 Saturday for the first time since Aug. 19, according to Coin Metrics. The jump brings bitcoin up almost 39% since the start of January. Ether , the second-biggest digital coin, rallied as high as $1,664.78 on Saturday. That's the first time it has surpassed $1,600 since Nov. 7, 2022. It was last trading at $1,637.40 apiece. Bitcoin has kicked off 2023 on a positive note, with investors hoping for a reversal in the monetary tightening that spooked market players last year. The Fed and other central banks began cutting interest rates in 2022, shocking holders of risky asset classes, like stocks and digital tokens. Publicly-listed tech stocks and private venture capital-backed start-ups particularly took a beating, as investors sought protection in assets perceived as safer, such as cash and bonds.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon A chart showing bitcoin's year-to-date price performance; the digital currency has climbed nearly 39% since the start of January.\n\nWith inflation now showing signs of cooling in the U.S., some market players are hopeful that central banks will start easing the pace of rate rises, or even slash rates. Economists previously told CNBC they predict a Fed rate cut could happen as soon as this year. \"Fed tightening seems to be lighter and inflation less of a risk,\" Charles Hayter, CEO of crypto data site CryptoCompare, said in emailed comments to CNBC. \"There is hope there will be more caution to rate rises globally.\" The Fed is likely to keep interest rates high for the time being. However, some officials at the bank have recently called for a reduction in the size of quarterly rate hikes, wary of a slowdown in economic activity. The world's top digital currency, bitcoin, is \"increasingly looking like it has put in its bottom,\" according to Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno. Bitcoin short sellers have been squeezed by sudden upward moves in prices, according to Ayyar. Short selling is an investment strategy whereby traders borrow an asset and then sell it in the hope that it will depreciate in value. A wipe-out of those short positions sparked by the rising price of bitcoin has added \"fuel to the fire,\" Ayyar said, as short sellers are forced to cover their bets by buying back the borrowed bitcoin to close them out.\n\nWhat crypto collapse?\n\nInvestors don't seem to have been greatly perturbed by the collapses of top crypto companies, stemming from the fallout of digital currency exchange FTX's insolvency in November.\n\nLast week, the lending arm of New York-based crypto investment firm Genesis became the latest casualty of the crypto crisis, seeking bankruptcy protection in a \"mega\" filing listing aggregate liabilities ranging from $1.2 billion to $11 billion. \"The Genesis debacle has been playing out for a while and is likely priced in already. FTX, on the other hand, has already had a significant impact on many investors, on market psychology and on the prices of several toxic assets,\" Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of crypto investment advisory firm Quantum Economics, told CNBC. \"It should be noted however that the price on bitcoin itself is quite limited since FTX didn't have any on their balance sheets.\" Bitcoin is still about 67% off its all-time high, despite its recent surge. The latest crypto plunge is different from past cycles, in large part due to the role played by leverage. Major crypto players became entangled in risky lending practices, offering lofty yields that many investors now say were unsustainable. This began in May with the collapse of terraUSD \u2014 or UST \u2014 an algorithmic stablecoin that was supposed to be pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar. The failure of UST brought down terraUSD's sister token luna and hit companies with exposure to both tokens. Three Arrows Capital, a hedge fund with bullish views on crypto, plunged into liquidation because of its exposure to terraUSD. Then came the November collapse of FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. It was run by Sam Bankman-Fried, an executive who was often in the spotlight. The fallout from FTX continues to ripple across the cryptocurrency industry. Roughly $2 trillion of value has been erased from the overall crypto market since the peak of the crypto boom in November 2021, in a deep downturn known as \"crypto winter.\"\n\nwatch now"

        "title": "The uncertain fate of upstate's most controversial bitcoin mining site - City & State New York",
        "content": "First opened in 1937, the coal-fired power plant outside the village of Dresden in the Finger Lakes region is one of many upstate power plants decommissioned in recent decades due to inefficiency and excessive greenhouse gas emissions. But the plant received a new lease on life in 2014, when Atlas Holdings acquired it and retrofitted it to burn natural gas rather than coal.\n\nGreenidge Generation, a subsidiary of Atlas Holdings, applied to the state Department of Environmental Conservation for a Title V air permit that would enable them to restart electricity generation. In that application, Greenidge said the plant would only operate part time, providing wholesale electricity to the state\u2019s power grid at times of peak demand. Greenidge\u2019s air permit was issued in 2016, with renewal scheduled for September 2021.\n\nThe Dresden plant restarted operations in 2017. At first, it only operated when demand on the grid and the price of electricity were especially high.\n\n\u201cIt was serving the grid and providing electricity solely to the grid,\u201d said Mandy DeRoche, deputy managing attorney in the Clean Energy Program at Earthjustice, which represents environmental groups opposed to Greenidge. \u201cSo we can see from the emissions profile and the days of operation, hours of operation, that they came online only a couple days a year. Each of those years, they correspond with heat waves and cold snaps.\u201d\n\nBut Greenidge soon discovered a way to monetize its electricity generation all year long.\n\nA lucrative opportunity\n\nIn the years after the Dresden plant restarted its operations, an increasing number of cryptocurrency mining companies set up operations in upstate New York, lured by relatively cheap electricity prices. Greenidge realized that it had access to a particularly cheap source of energy, since it owned its own power plant, and began investing in bitcoin mining.\n\nStarting in 2020, Greenidge began operating the Dresden plant nearly full time, using most of the power generated to power its own bitcoin mining rigs rather than selling it to the grid.\n\n\u201cAs both the cryptocurrency markets and the power markets are constantly fluctuating, we do whichever is more profitable at any given time \u2013 either sell the generated power or mine crypto with that power,\u201d Greenidge Chief Financial Officer Tim Rainey told Forbes in 2020.\n\nAs it became a leading company in the cryptocurrency mining space, Greenidge went public on the Nasdaq stock exchange through a reverse merger and took out large loans to finance the purchase of more mining rigs and a second power plant/crypto mining facility in South Carolina.\n\nEmissions create a downside\n\nAs the Dresden plant was now running around the clock, its total greenhouse gas emissions spiked \u2013 jumping from about 40,000 tons of carbon dioxide in 2019 to more than 200,000 tons in 2020.\n\nEnvironmental advocates protested, arguing that the state Department of Environmental Conservation had only authorized the operation of a part-time power plant, not a full-time cryptocurrency mining facility.\n\nThe department ultimately rejected this argument. But the agency was more receptive to advocates\u2019 claim that Greenidge\u2019s operation of the Dresden plant could violate the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, a landmark climate law that the state enacted in 2019.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big change between the 2016 permit and the 2021 application for the renewal is that groundbreaking climate law passed that does not allow for emissions increases to interfere or be inconsistent with the emissions reductions in New York state,\u201d DeRoche said.\n\nAfter a monthslong public comment hearing and repeated delays, the department\u2019s Division of Environmental Permits denied Greenidge\u2019s air permit renewal on June 30, 2022.\n\n\u201cBased on the information in the Application as prepared and submitted by Greenidge, as well as public comments and other relevant information, the Department hereby determines that the Facility\u2019s continued operation in its current manner would be inconsistent with or would interfere with the attainment of the Statewide GHG emission limits,\u201d the agency wrote in a letter explaining its decision.\n\nUncertain fate\n\nGreenidge immediately appealed the decision, and it is currently being reviewed by an administrative law judge. If the judge upholds the state Department of Environmental Conservation\u2019s denial of the permit, then Greenidge would likely appeal the decision in state court. Until Greenidge exhausts all of its appeals \u2013 which could take a year or more \u2013 the Dresden plant will be allowed to continue using the expired air permit.\n\nBut it\u2019s possible mining operations at the Dresden plant could grind to a halt well before that. Like other crypto mining companies, Greenidge has been hit hard by the collapse in bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nOn Dec. 20, the company agreed to sell most of its mining hardware to NYDIG, a creditor to whom it owes $74 million, and warned investors that it may soon have to file for voluntary bankruptcy protection. Greenidge did not respond to a request for comment on this article.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock, worth roughly $15 per share in early 2022, is now worth less than $1 per share, putting it at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq."

        "content": "A solo Bitcoin miner with an average hashing power of just 10 TH/s (terahashes per second) won the race to add block 772,793 to the Bitcoin blockchain on Friday.\n\nAt the time the block was added, Bitcoin's total hash rate was just over 269 exahash per second, meaning the solo miner's 10 TH/s hash rate represented just 0.000000037% of the blockchain's entire computational power.\n\nPut simply: It was an extremely unlikely win for an individual miner.\n\nCongratulations to miner 1CEmkQkgiCMx6DHSDkHi53mL8oEthCZSw with only 10TH who solved a solo block at https://t.co/UWgBvLkDqc ! https://t.co/0O7A7KR4eu \u2014 Dr. Con Kolivas (@ckpooldev) January 20, 2023\n\nDespite the odds stacked against them, the solo miner was the first to produce a valid hash for the block to be mined. In return, the miner received 98% of the total 6.35939231 BTC allotted for the block reward and fees. The remaining 2% went to Solo CK Pool, an online mining service that facilitates individual mining.\n\nBitcoin's randomness and probabilities coded for luck and work\n\nTo add a block to a proof-of-work blockchain like Bitcoin, the miner must be the first to calculate a valid hash for the block, which can only be discovered using brute computational force.\n\nMining machines run an encryption algorithm to produce a hash that falls below a threshold specified by the network. If the algorithm produces a value that is above the hash target, the miner tries the algorithm again with a slightly altered input to produce a completely new value for the hash. Miners built specifically to perform this function are able to compute trillions of unique hashes each second.\n\nHowever, even if a miner's machine were able to only produce one hash per second, it is theoretically possible that the algorithm's first output could be a valid hash to solve the block.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat were the odds?\n\nThe chances of adding a block as a solo miner are determined by the number of hashes the miner's rig is computing per second in relation to the total number of hashes that all of the machines on the network are computing each second.\n\nAccording to a post from user Willi9974 on the BitcoinTalk forum less than an hour after block 772,793 was solved, the lucky solo miner had an average hash rate over the previous hour of 10.6 TH/s.\n\nThe information posted on BitcoinTalk also revealed that the ~10 TH/s was the combined power of four machines (called \"workers\"). This suggests that this solo miner's rig was likely made up of four USB stick Bitcoin miners, which can individually achieve a hash rate of around 3 TH/s and cost roughly $200 each.\n\nUsing the difficulty level included in block 772,793 and assuming the solo miner's rig was computing 10 TH/s, it is possible to calculate the total estimated hash rate as 269,082,950 TH/s at the time the block was solved.\n\nBased on this, the odds of this solo miner being the first to solve the block with a valid hash are one in 26.9 million. Statistically, that means that if the same circumstances were repeated infinite times, the solo miner would add the block 0.000000037% of the time, on average.\n\nUnlikely, but not impossible\u2014and this has happened before\n\nWhile this scenario was extremely unlikely, similar \"once-in-a-lifetime\" events in Bitcoin mining have happened before.\n\nOne year ago, in less than two weeks, there were three different solo miners that solved blocks with improbable hash rates\u2014the third's hash rate was apparently just 8.3 TH/s in comparison to the estimated 190,719,350 TH/s total hash rate, which comes out to a one in 23 million chance (or 0.000000044%).\n\nA hash is either valid and thus solves the block, or it isn't. There is no strategy involved, as the entire system is based on the random generation of hash values and the response mechanisms of the network to maintain core probabilities. Bitcoin runs on code and formulas, so a solo miner somehow solving the next four blocks is perfectly possible within Bitcoin\u2019s mathematical system.\n\nMining pools remain the usual winners\n\nAnecdotes about solo miners like these could end up introducing a new hobby to the ever-hopeful. However, the vast majority of blocks added to the Bitcoin blockchain today have been produced by large pools of mining rigs that combine their hashing power and share earnings.\n\nIn doing so, each miner's contribution is rewarded proportionally each time the pool mines a block.\n\nAccording to blockchain explorer and mining pool BTC.com, the largest Bitcoin mining pool is currently Foundry USA, with its collective 90.19 EH/s computing power making up 31.3% of the network's total hash rate\u2014which means they earn a share of the block rewards and fees for one in every three blocks, on average.\n\nMining pools date back to 2010 and have steadily captured greater shares of hash rate distribution year over year as mining difficulty increased and mining technology improved. Today, at least 98% of Bitcoin miners online belong to a mining pool."

        "title": "Congo's Oldest National Park Bets on Bitcoin - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nIn Congo\u2019s Virunga National Park, compounding issues from the pandemic and violent conflict have had a dramatic impact on tourism, leading park administrators to turn toward green-energy-based Bitcoin mining.\n\nVirunga National Park has had a storied history since its founding in 1925. The oldest national park in The Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is arguably one of the oldest in Africa, especially considering that older parks were established with titles like \u201cGame Preserve No. 3.\u201d Having once been the largest park in the Congo, it sits on the border with two other countries, and has since split between them. The largest piece, however, remains in the Congo, where it is home to thousands of endangered species, including a gorilla that only exists in the park. And it is in trouble.\n\nA series of significant problems has led to park authorities\u2019 decision to begin bitcoin mining in the national park. The park\u2019s status on the border between three nations has engulfed it in various humanitarian crises, like the Congo Wars and the Rwandan Genocide. Although refugees can certainly disrupt endangered habitats, the real danger has come from the fighters. Armed militias from these conflicts can come to poach timber and animals, extract oil, even set up permanent bases and more. And while these threats are bad enough to discourage visitation, the global COVID-19 pandemic further hurt tourism revenues, wiping out 40% of park revenue.\n\nIt is for these reasons that park director Emmanuel de Merode has pursued a radical solution: using park facilities to mine Bitcoin. Three hydroelectric dams exist within the park, which can readily convert excess electricity into bitcoin with zero carbon emissions. The operation began in late 2020, and now includes thousands of mining rigs. Some 70% are owned by Big Block Green Services, which has partnered with the park and purchases electricity, while the other 30% are owned directly by the park itself. De Merode seemed unconcerned about market fluctuation, claiming that, \u201cWe\u2019re not speculating on its value; we\u2019re generating it. If you buy bitcoin and it decreases, you lose money. We\u2019re making bitcoin out of surplus energy and monetizing something that otherwise has no value. That\u2019s a big difference.\u201d\n\nThis radical solution is right at home in a climate of growing Bitcoin adoption in Africa. As international Bitcoin conferences take off, major developers worldwide are already planning to build the infrastructure that can meet growing demand. Virunga turning to decentralized cryptocurrency is just another example of how well Bitcoin can penetrate into new markets, and how its use-cases beyond pure speculation to power a strong community. Although Virunga National Park is facing real dangers near its 100-year anniversary, Bitcoin can show it a bright future for 100 more.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "JONESBOROUGH, Tenn. (WJHL) \u2014 Washington County\u2019s lawsuit against utility BrightRidge and Bitcoin mine operator Red Dog Technologies will likely go to trial before this fall, the county attorney told county commissioners Monday night.\n\nCommissioners voted overwhelmingly Nov. 28 to reject a settlement proposal that would have allowed Red Dog to build a new Bitcoin mine at the Washington County Industrial Park to replace one in Limestone that started operating in late 2020.\n\nCommissioners sued BrightRidge in November 2021, claiming the mine didn\u2019t meet zoning requirements and that no permit for it had been granted. BrightRidge leases property to Red Dog next to its Bailey Bridge Road substation in the New Salem community and it was BrightRidge that initially applied for a rezoning to allow what it said would be a \u201cblockchain data center.\u201d\n\nGRIID Infrastructure, Red Dog\u2019s parent company, was the planned user of the space and a Bitcoin mine is a type of blockchain data center, but county commissioners were never told about a Bitcoin mine or a user other than BrightRidge when the utility applied for the rezoning in February 2020.\n\nThe lawsuit came months after residents near the mine complained of its noise in May 2021. The mine has continued to operate throughout the duration of the lawsuit.\n\nWilkinson talked at greater length with commissioners in a closed executive session Monday night. She did say in response to a question from Commissioner Richard Tucker that \u201cthe lawsuit that Washington County filed was never dismissed while settlement was under discussion.\u201d\n\nShe said the day after the county\u2019s 13-2 vote to reject the settlement proposal, her office contacted Washington County Chancery Court, where the suit is filed, \u201cto advise them that settlement was not an option under those terms.\u201d\n\nHer office explained some scheduling issues that defense attorneys had raised considering the coming holidays. As of Monday morning, no updates had been filed in the case, but Wilkinson said that was going to change soon.\n\n\u201cJust this week we have heard back from the court to discuss different trial dates,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cThat would be the next step.\u201d\n\nWilkinson said she has already discussed dates with Angie Charles, Washington County\u2019s planning director and the primary plaintiff in the case, about her schedule.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting to hear from all counsel that all of the parties are available,\u201d Wilkinson said. Plaintiff Washington County stands ready for trial as and when the court sets it, which I would expect to be before the fall.\u201d\n\nGRIID, meanwhile, has had a deadline extended for it to go public through a \u201cspecial purpose acquisition company\u201d (SPAC) called Adit EdTech. The SPAC\u2019s shareholders voted overwhelmingly to allow a six-month extension past a previous January deadline.\n\nA report by GRIID filed in early December as part of an Adit EdTech Securities and Exchange Commission filing reveals that GRIID had suffered net losses of almost $37 million through the first nine months of 2022, compared to a net profit of $5.1 million for the same period of 2021. GRIID has operating losses of $13.7 million in the first nine months of 2022, with most of the remainder of its net losses coming from interest expenses.\n\nIn 2021, GRIID had an operating profit of $14.6 million as Bitcoin prices were higher.\n\nThat report also revealed that GRIID\u2019s entire Bitcoin mining capacity is just 68 megawatts (MW). About 25 MW of that is at the Limestone site.\n\nIn addition to lower prices for Bitcoin, GRIID paid more for electricity in 2022.\n\nGRIID has had to borrow additional funds at very high interest rates in recent months. The company\u2019s interest expense in the first nine months of 2022 was $22.7 million, compared to just $2.6 million in the first nine months of 2021.\n\nThe company had to rework its lending agreement with Blockchain Access Limited in mid-2022. Rather than a line of credit with the company it now has a $57 million term loan."

        "content": "2023 is off to a precarious start, with the market higher but a lot of uncertainty in the air about economic and market conditions moving forward.\n\nCrypto has begun to poke its head out with the price of Bitcoin (BTC 2.16%) rebounding nicely and recently topping $21,000 in hopes of cooling inflation and a weakening dollar. While I don't know what the future holds this year, if inflation keeps cooling and the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates, there is a chance for a more bullish year for the broader crypto market.\n\nIn a bull market and more of a risk-on environment, I see the potential for the popular meme token Shiba Inu (SHIB 1.88%) to beat Bitcoin in 2023. Here's why.\n\nA more volatile token\n\nBitcoin is the pioneer of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, which is a big reason it has become the world's largest and most trusted cryptocurrency. Altcoins like Shiba Inu tend to move with a high correlation to Bitcoin.\n\nBut as people and institutions all over the world have adopted Bitcoin and it's become more ingrained into the mainstream financial system, the price of Bitcoin has become more stable than the altcoin market, not that one would necessarily call Bitcoin stable in the grand scheme of things.\n\nWhile things can always change quickly in crypto, since the pandemic, when the price of Bitcoin falls, I expect altcoins to fall more and have more downside. But on the flip side, when Bitcoin rises, I would expect altcoins to swing higher, making the volatility both a pro and a con for many altcoins.\n\nArguably the most viral cryptocurrency\n\nFew altcoins have been more volatile or created more buzz than the meme token Shiba Inu, which now has over a $6.5 billion market cap.\n\nShiba Inu rose to prominence as a joke on Dogecoin (DOGE 1.13%), which started the meme token craze. Even in 2022, when the crypto market fell into a crypto winter, Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, reported that Shiba Inu was one of the three large most-watched cryptocurrencies in 2022, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH 1.38%).\n\nAnd this buzz has continued into 2023, with Shiba Inu ranking first on CoinMarketCap's trending list as recently as Jan. 9, so there is really no token better than going viral and generating buzz than Shiba Inu.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has also generated interest due to its soon-to-be-launched Shibarium layer 2 protocol, which \"provides the benefits of scalability, faster transaction times, lower fees, and an expanded development framework\" for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. This is the first time developers are attempting to really improve the technical capabilities of Shiba Inu, so it will be interesting to see how it plays out.\n\nHow Shiba Inu wins in 2023\n\nI'll clarify here that I still much prefer owning Bitcoin over Shiba Inu. I also think that Bitcoin's further stability is more evidence of its growing acceptance and long-term viability.\n\nBut I could see Shiba Inu outperforming Bitcoin this year under the right conditions. We'll really need more favorable buying conditions and more of a risk-on environment. That means more signs of cooling inflation and the Fed ending its rate-hiking campaign and potentially cutting rates later this year as well.\n\nI also think investors need to regain some confidence back in the industry, especially after the FTX bankruptcy and the contagion it has spread. But if crypto escapes the crypto winter and goes on a bull run, I would expect Shiba Inu to outperform Bitcoin due to its greater volatility and virality."

        "content": "CNN \u2014\n\nRuja Ignatova strode onto the stage in a flowing burgundy ball gown adorned with black sparkles. Beams of light flashed, fireballs erupted and Alicia Keys\u2019 \u201cGirl on Fire\u201d blared through the speakers.\n\n\u201cLooks like a girl, but she\u2019s a flame. So bright, she can burn your eyes \u2013 better look the other way,\u201d the song crooned as a beaming Ignatova thanked the cheering crowd at London\u2019s Wembley Arena.\n\nThat was in June 2016, when cryptocurrency was an emerging buzzword and investors were scrambling to cash in. Ignatova called herself the \u201cCryptoqueen\u201d and touted her company, OneCoin, as a lucrative rival to Bitcoin in the growing cryptocurrency market.\n\n\u201cIn two years, nobody will speak about Bitcoin anymore,\u201d she said, as investors applauded and whistled.\n\nSixteen months later, Ignatova boarded a plane in Sofia, Bulgaria, and vanished. She hasn\u2019t been seen since.\n\nAuthorities say OneCoin was a pyramid scheme that defrauded people out of more than $4 billion as Ignatova convinced investors in the US and around the globe to throw fistfuls of cash at her company. Federal prosecutors describe OneCoin as one of the largest international fraud schemes ever perpetrated.\n\nRuja Ignatova is one of the FBI's 10 most-wanted fugitives -- the only woman currently on that list. FBI\n\nShe is now one of the FBI\u2019s 10 most-wanted fugitives, alongside accused gang leaders and murderers, and is the only woman currently on that list. Of the 529 fugitives on the FBI\u2019s list since it launched in 1950, she\u2019s one of just 11 women.\n\nIgnatova and her partners \u201cconned unsuspecting victims out of billions of dollars, claiming that OneCoin would be the \u2018Bitcoin killer,\u2019\u201d US Attorney Damian Williams, New York\u2019s top prosecutor, said in a statement last month.\n\n\u201cIn fact, OneCoins were entirely worthless \u2026 (Their) lies were designed with one goal, to get everyday people all over the world to part with their hard-earned money.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Should you invest in crypto? One expert weighs in after FTX's collapse 01:13 - Source: CNN Business\n\nShe knew it was a scam from the start, court documents say\n\nSince Ignatova disappeared in October 2017, her face has been plastered on the FBI website and across major news outlets worldwide. She\u2019s also one of the most wanted fugitives in Europe.\n\nAt the bottom of her FBI wanted poster is a note: \u201cIgnatova is believed to travel with armed guards and/or associates. Ignatova may have had plastic surgery or otherwise altered her appearance.\u201d\n\nThe FBI says it picks fugitives for the list based on the length of their criminal records and how dangerous they may be. It also favors fugitives who are not well known to maximize the benefit of the program\u2019s nationwide publicity.\n\nThe bureau declined to provide additional details to CNN beyond court documents from the US Department of Justice, which did not list an attorney for Ignatova. \u201cThis case is an ongoing investigation. We are unable to comment beyond what has already been released publicly,\u201d said Daniel Crifo, a spokesperson for the FBI office in New York.\n\nBut court documents detail a mind-blowing narrative: how Ignatova and her OneCoin co-founder, Karl Sebastian Greenwood, were allegedly aware from the start that their ambitious venture was a Ponzi scheme.\n\n\u201cThe cryptocurrency OneCoin was established for the sole purpose of defrauding investors,\u201d IRS Special Agent John R. Tafur said in a statement.\n\nIgnatova called herself the \"Cryptoqueen\" and touted her company, OneCoin, as a lucrative rival to Bitcoin in the growing cryptocurrency market. U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York/Twitter\n\nWhile Greenwood and Ignatova were working on the concept for OneCoin, they referred to it in emails as a \u201ctrashy coin,\u201d federal officials said in court documents. The documents show Greenwood described their investors as \u201cidiots\u201d and \u201ccrazy\u201d in an email to Ignatova\u2019s brother, Konstantin Ignatov, who also took part in the scam and assumed OneCoin leadership after his sister vanished, according to prosecutors.\n\n\u201cIt might not be (something) really clean or that I normally work on or even can be proud of (except with you in private when we make the money),\u201d Ignatova wrote to Greenwood in 2014.\n\nShe also proposed an exit strategy should the company fail, saying in a 2014 email to Greenwood that they should \u201ctake the money and run and blame somebody else for this.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Neighbor put his house up for sale after this loud facility popped up next to him without warning 03:50 - Source: CNN\n\nFrom a young age, Ignatova wanted to be rich\n\nRuja Ignatova, 42, is a German citizen but was born in Bulgaria, where her father was an engineer and her mother was a teacher.\n\nIn his book, \u201cThe Missing Crypto Queen,\u201d author Jamie Bartlett detailed her rise from modest beginnings to entrepreneurial stardom.\n\nWhen she was a girl, her family moved to Germany, where Ignatova excelled as a student and spent her free time studying and playing chess, Bartlett wrote. Classmates described her as smart, driven and aloof.\n\nIgnatova won a scholarship to a university in Konstanz, Germany, where she met and married a fellow law student. She maintained she didn\u2019t want children, Bartlett wrote, because they would get in the way of her acquiring wealth.\n\nShe also told people she wanted to be a millionaire by age 30.\n\n\u201cShe desperately wanted to be rich, even devouring books in the early hours about how to make money,\u201d Bartlett wrote.\n\nAfter studying European law at Oxford University, Ignatova landed a job in Sofia as a consultant for McKinsey & Company, the international management consulting firm.\n\nClients trusted her and related to her rise from humble beginnings and fierce desire to be rich, Bartlett wrote. Her fluency in languages, including Russian, German, English and Bulgarian, also helped.\n\nAppearances mattered to Ignatova, who often attended events in evening gowns and bright red lipstick, with diamonds dangling from her ears.\n\n\u201cEverything exhibited success and glamor,\u201d Bartlett wrote. \u201cShe was obsessed with style and image.\u201d\n\nKonstantin Ignatov pleaded guilty to fraud and related charges in connection to his sister's company. He's scheduled to be sentenced in February. From Konstantin Ignatov/Instagram\n\nOneCoin allegedly promised investors a fivefold to tenfold return\n\nCryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are digital assets created and managed by a global, decentralized network of computers instead of a bank or government. Bitcoin, for example, is \u201cmined,\u201d or created, by professional crypto miners using armies of servers in data centers.\n\nIt is a largely unregulated and highly volatile industry, and expert opinions on the viability of crypto run the gamut. Advocates broadly envision a future in which economies run on digital currencies validated by the community of users rather by a central bank. Critics dismiss it as a Ponzi scheme or, at minimum, a highly risky investment.\n\nIn 2014, Ignatova and Greenwood, her co-founder, started pitching OneCoin to investors in Europe, New York and around the world. They hosted online webinars and conferences where they urged potential investors to deposit funds in an account that would enable the purchase of OneCoin packages, according to a federal indictment.\n\nOneCoin operated as a multilevel marketing network in which investors received commissions for recruiting others to buy cryptocurrency packages, federal prosecutors said. The packages catered to various income levels, from \u201cstarter\u201d to \u201ctycoon trader.\u201d\n\nIgnatova and her partners promised buyers a fivefold or even tenfold return on their investment, according to court documents.\n\nOneCoin co-founder Karl Sebastian Greenwood, seen in 2016. He later pleaded guilty to wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money. U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York/Twitter\n\nA buying frenzy ensued. Between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, investors gave OneCoin more than $4 billion, federal prosecutors said, citing records obtained in the course of their investigation. Some $50 million came from investors in the US, according to court documents.\n\n\u201cShe timed her scheme perfectly, capitalizing on the frenzied speculation of the early days of cryptocurrency,\u201d said Williams, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan.\n\nOneCoins were not mined like other cryptocurrencies, federal investigators said. Instead of armies of powerful servers, OneCoin was generated by a piece of software, court documents said.\n\nFederal prosecutors said that in an email to Greenwood in August 2014, Ignatova wrote, \u201cWe are not mining actually but telling people sh*t.\u201d\n\nOneCoin\u2019s value was not based on market supply and demand like other cryptocurrency, prosecutors said, but simply manipulated privately by OneCoin itself.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback These are the celebs impacted by the collapse of FTX 01:34 - Source: CNN\n\nBut then things came crashing down\n\nThe facade started cracking in 2016 when investors had a hard time selling their OneCoins to recoup their original investments, court documents say.\n\nWord began to spread online that the business was a scam. Media outlets started asking questions. International and US federal investigators got involved.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what happened to Ignatova\u2019s marriage. But the FBI said she learned OneCoin was being investigated after she bugged an apartment belonging to her American boyfriend and found out he was cooperating with a federal probe into her company\u2019s practices.\n\nIn October 2017, the US Department of Justice charged Ignatova with one count each of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. She also was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, which carries a maximum five-year sentence. A federal judge in New York issued a warrant for her arrest.\n\nLess than two weeks later, on October 25, 2017, she boarded a commercial flight from Sofia, Bulgaria, to Athens, Greece, court documents said.\n\nThen she disappeared, leaving her business partners to take the fall for the failing company.\n\nThe FBI said it believes she may have traveled on a German passport from Athens, possibly to the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Russia, Eastern Europe or even back to Bulgaria. It\u2019s offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to her arrest.\n\n\u201cShe left with a tremendous amount of cash,\u201d Michael Driscoll, the FBI\u2019s assistant director-in-charge in New York, told reporters. \u201cMoney can buy a lot of friends, and I would imagine she\u2019s taking advantage of that.\u201d\n\nHer partners weren\u2019t so lucky. Greenwood was arrested in July 2018 at his home in Koh Samui, Thailand, and extradited to the US. He pleaded guilty in December to wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money. He is in jail and faces 20 years in prison for each of the three counts when he\u2019s sentenced in April.\n\nIgnatova\u2019s brother, Konstantin Ignatov, was arrested in March 2019 at Los Angeles International Airport. He\u2019d traveled to the US on business and was preparing to board his return flight to Bulgaria when five large men in suits handcuffed him and took him to an interrogation room, where they peppered him with questions about his missing sister, Bartlett wrote.\n\nIgnatov pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering and fraud charges, and is scheduled to be sentenced in February.\n\nOneCoin has shut down and its website is no longer active.\n\nBut its founder, the woman in the long gowns and flashy jewelry, has eluded authorities. More than five years after the Cryptoqueen got off a plane in Greece, her whereabouts remain a mystery."

        "content": "Early last year, the cryptocurrency industry was still flying high. A single bitcoin was worth about $40,000, major cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase, FTX and Crypto.com ran ads during the 2022 Super Bowl featuring major celebrities encouraging viewers to invest in crypto. New York City\u2019s newly elected mayor took his first three paychecks in bitcoin and talked up the industry at every opportunity. And cryptocurrency mining companies lured by cheap electricity prices upstate were flocking to New York.\n\nA year later, things look very different. Bitcoin is worth about $20,000, and the mayor has mostly stopped talking about it. FTX filed for bankruptcy, and its charismatic founder (and major political donor) Sam Bankman-Fried is under federal indictment for allegedly defrauding customers. And the state Legislature has passed a new law limiting the ability of cryptocurrency mining companies to take over upstate power plants.\n\nThe future of the cryptocurrency industry in New York has never been less certain. But to figure out where the industry is going, we first have to understand how it got here.\n\nMining moratorium\n\nBy design, mining cryptocurrencies like bitcoin require an astronomical amount of computing power and consume large amounts of electricity. The high electricity consumption is not just a side effect of bitcoin\u2019s protocol; it is the very source of bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nBitcoin relies on a \u201cproof-of-work\u201d mining system, which means that new bitcoins are awarded to computers known as \u201cminers\u201d that solve impossible mathematical equations. The only way for the computer to solve them is through random guesses. When a miner does happen to randomly stumble upon the correct solution, they receive a small amount of bitcoin as a reward.\n\nFor some time after bitcoin was initially introduced in 2009, it was possible for ordinary users to mine bitcoin using their home computers. But the equations have gotten increasingly difficult over the years, and it now requires entire data centers full of mining hardware to have any real shot at successfully mining bitcoin. Now, bitcoin mining is largely the domain of professional cryptocurrency mining companies, which raise millions of dollars to finance the construction of large data centers and to purchase the large quantities of electricity needed to power their mining rigs.\n\nThe increasing consolidation of bitcoin mining, and the industry\u2019s expanding need for more electricity, has led to a curious trend \u2013 cryptocurrency companies have started buying their own power plants.\n\nThe trend started with Greenidge Generation, which in 2020 turned an unprofitable upstate natural gas plant into a dedicated mining facility.\n\nMore recently, the Canadian cryptocurrency mining company Digihost acquired a natural gas plant near Buffalo, and it has plans to turn it into a dedicated bitcoin mining facility. Environmental groups have sued the state Public Service Commission, which must approve the transfer of any power plant, to try to block the sale.\n\nIn an attempt to prevent more bitcoin mining companies from taking over fossil fuel-based power plants, Assembly Member Anna Kelles sponsored a proof-of-work bitcoin mining moratorium bill that was signed into law last year. The bill will prohibit the state Department of Environmental Conservation from granting or renewing the Title V air permits of fossil fuel-based power plants that engage in proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining for two years.\n\nSince power plants cannot legally operate without valid Title V air permits, this will eventually prevent fossil fuel-based power plants from engaging in crypto mining when their current permits expire. Neither Greenidge nor Digihost will be affected by the moratorium, since they already have the necessary air permits, but the bill will prevent any more plants from pivoting to crypto \u2013 at least for the next two years.\n\nThe moratorium only applies to cryptocurrency mining companies that own fossil fuel power plants; miners that just buy their electricity from the grid or own hydropower plants will not be affected.\n\nIn addition to imposing the limited moratorium, the law requires the department to produce a full environmental impact statement detailing the effects of cryptocurrency mining on New York\u2019s environmental goals.\n\nKelles told City & State that it was necessary to implement a limited moratorium as soon as possible because there are currently 49 decommissioned fossil fuel power plants in New York state that could easily be purchased and brought back online by crypto mining companies.\n\nThe crypto industry opposed Kelles\u2019 bill, instead advancing a competing bill co-sponsored by Assembly Member Clyde Vanel.\n\nVanel, the chair of the Assembly Internet and New Technology Subcommittee, is a strong supporter of the cryptocurrency industry who personally owns 10 different types of cryptocurrency and has introduced multiple bills related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. Last year, he co-sponsored a bill to create a Cryptocurrency & Blockchain Task Force. The task force \u2013 which would have included a diverse group of stakeholders, including academics, industry representatives, investors, regulators and policymakers \u2013 would have studied the issue and then eventually issued a report.\n\nAlthough both the Kelles and Vanel bills ultimately passed the Legislature, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed Kelles\u2019 bill into law and vetoed Vanel\u2019s bill. Vanel told City & State that he was considering reintroducing the task force study bill in the current legislative session.\n\nThe politics of regulation\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry has long decried the state\u2019s regulations, mostly because New York is one of the few states that actually does attempt to regulate the industry.\n\nIn 2015, the state Department of Financial Services issued new regulations requiring anyone engaged in \u201cvirtual currency business activity\u201d to apply for and receive a special state license. This virtual currency license, known as a \u201cBitLicense,\u201d can be difficult to obtain. Over the past eight years, only 22 entities have received a BitLicense.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry has repeatedly criticized this virtual licensing regime. In 2021, for example, the cryptocurrency news site CoinDesk published an op-ed titled, \u201cKill the BitLicense,\u201d which argued that the BitLicense had prevented innovative cryptocurrency startups from flourishing in New York.\n\nIndustry-friendly politicians also advocated for reforming the BitLicense system.\n\n\u201cThe New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) has the dubious distinction of being the single worst regulator of crypto in the country,\u201d Rep. Ritchie Torres declared last year in a Daily News op-ed titled \u201cA liberal case for cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s regulatory regime has the cost of inhibiting job creation and innovation without the actual benefit of protecting a single consumer or investor,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic case of bureaucracy trumping efficacy.\u201d\n\nAt the time it was published in March, bitcoin was worth more than $40,000 and the industry seemed on the cusp of mainstream legitimacy and real political power.\n\nNew York City had just elected Mayor Eric Adams, a proud bitcoin fan. One of the mayor-elect\u2019s first moves was to hitch a ride to Puerto Rico on the private jet of Brock Pierce, a child actor turned crypto billionaire. Adams also converted his first three mayoral paychecks to bitcoin and promised to make New York a crypto hub, which among other things involved touting the creation of a worthless new cryptocurrency called \u201cNYCCoin.\u201d\n\nPierce wasn\u2019t the only crypto billionaire seeking to influence politics. Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old founder of Bahamas-based crypto exchange FTX, established himself as a major political donor and philanthropist by donating tens of millions of dollars to political candidates across the country. In 2022, he was the second-largest donor to Democratic Party candidates, and recipients of his donations included U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Rep. Gregory Meeks and Torres. (The Intercept reported that Bankman-Fried also hosted a fundraiser for Torres, but the representative denied it.)\n\nBankman-Fried claimed publicly that he was donating to candidates who shared his passion for preventing the next pandemic, though many recipients of his largesse also happened to sit on powerful committees that could influence the federal government\u2019s approach to cryptocurrency regulation.\n\nIn particular, Bankman-Fried advocated for the passage of a bill, co-sponsored by Gillibrand, that would have classified cryptocurrencies as commodities instead of securities. This would have ensured that cryptocurrencies were not subject to the very strict regulations placed on investment securities and the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s enforcement of those regulations. Instead, the crypto industry would be regulated by the comparatively more friendly Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The legislation would also have moved congressional oversight of the industry from the House and Senate financial services committees to the chambers\u2019 respective agriculture committees.\n\nTorres, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, told City & State that he did not support Gillibrand\u2019s bill, since it would have taken power away from his committee.\n\nAsked whether cryptocurrencies should be regulated as securities or commodities, he said that there was no one-size-fits-all solution.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a crypto asset that resembles a security, it should be subject to SEC regulation, and if it resembles a commodity, it should be subject to CFTC regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the digital asset is a stablecoin, it should be subject to the Federal Reserve, which regulates our national currency. So the nature of the digital asset ought to determine the nature of the regulation.\u201d\n\nBankruptcies and lawsuits\n\nIn the past year, numerous cryptocurrency exchanges and lending companies have declared bankruptcy, and hundreds of thousands of customers who invested in these companies have lost access to their funds.\n\nThe trouble started in May, when the stablecoin Terra \u2013 which was never supposed to be worth less than $1 \u2013 declined in price. Companies that owned Terra lost money, which meant they could no longer afford to pay back their loans, which meant that their creditors lost money, and so on. As the contagion spread throughout the industry, a number of cryptocurrency firms \u2013 including Three Arrows Capital, Celsius, Voyager and BlockFi \u2013 filed for bankruptcy.\n\nBankman-Fried and FTX attempted to acquire BlockFi and Voyager to protect their customers from losing their money. But in November, it was revealed that FTX had also lost many of its customers\u2019 deposits. FTX declared bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried was soon arrested, extradited to the United States and indicted on federal charges related to securities fraud, commodities fraud and campaign finance violations. The price of bitcoin sank below $20,000.\n\nCompared to citizens of other states, New Yorkers were relatively protected from the cryptocurrency downturn \u2013 since many of the crypto companies that have lost customers\u2019 deposits were never allowed to operate in the state in the first place.\n\n\u201cNew Yorkers for the most part have been insulated and protected from the downfall of Voyager, of Celsius, of FTX.\u201d Vanel said. \u201cOne of our agencies, DFS, came out with something called the BitLicense. It was enacted and put in place in 2015. And since then, no New Yorker that abided by the rules has gotten caught in Celsius, Voyager, FTX.\u201d\n\nThese days, even Torres seems supportive of the BitLicense, albeit with tweaks.\n\n\u201cI have one criticism of New York state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes too long to get a BitLicense. It should not take three years. But having said that, New York is regulating crypto more effectively than the federal government. If the SEC or the CFTC had had the same kind of framework that DFS adopted back in 2015, then a scandal like FTX could have been prevented.\u201d\n\nNeither the state Department of Financial Services nor state Attorney General Letitia James have been shy about going after cryptocurrency companies that have failed to follow the state\u2019s regulations.\n\nIn February 2021, the state attorney general reached an $18.5 million settlement with the stablecoin Tether and its affiliated cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which required both companies to stop operating in the state. The company was cagey about disclosing proof of its cash reserves and its murky relationship with sister company Bitfinex, and the state attorney general\u2019s office accused it of hiding $850 million in losses.\n\nLater that year, James sued Coinseed for allegedly defrauding customers and forced the company to shut down.\n\nIn June 2022, the state attorney general secured a $1 million settlement with BlockFi for offering unregistered securities.\n\nThis month, James filed a lawsuit against former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky for allegedly defrauding investors. Even more lawsuits against cryptocurrency companies are expected in the coming months.\n\nThe Department of Financial Services, meanwhile, just reached a $100 million settlement with Coinbase for failing to comply with the state\u2019s anti-money laundering laws.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nAfter the major disruptions of the past year, the future of the cryptocurrency industry in New York is more uncertain than ever.\n\nThe signing of Kelles\u2019 bitcoin moratorium bill promises to reshape the upstate cryptocurrency mining landscape. Miners may have to embrace hydropower and other renewable energy sources to power their bitcoin mining operations. Another possibility is that the industry will increasingly abandon proof-of-work mining.\n\nWhile proof-of-work was the original method of mining cryptocurrency, alternatives do exist. A number of newer cryptocurrencies, including Solana, use an approach called \u201cproof-of-stake,\u201d which uses orders of magnitude less computing power and electricity. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, switched from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake last year.\n\n\u201cWe put all this emphasis on (proof-of-work) cryptocurrency mining, but it is the dinosaur,\u201d Kelles said. \u201cIt was the first one created, but if you are looking at newer technologies, they are very nimble, and that is where a lot of the innovation is happening.\u201d\n\nKelles said that she would like to see bitcoin switch to proof-of-stake, though she doubts that it ever will.\n\nTorres is also a fan of proof-of-stake: \u201cAll cryptocurrency should transition to sustainable alternatives to proof of work for the sake of combating climate change.\u201d\n\nOver the past eight years, New York state has proven that it is possible to comprehensively regulate the nascent crypto industry. But so far, the state\u2019s approach has not been replicated by other states or the federal government. Last year, California\u2019s governor vetoed a bill that would have introduced a virtual currency license modeled on New York\u2019s BitLicense.\n\nOn the federal level, cryptocurrency remains a largely unregulated sector, but it will not remain that way forever. And when Congress does finally take steps to seriously regulate the industry, it seems likely to look to New York\u2019s approach as a model to emulate.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry is hopeful that the feds will take the right lesson from New York\u2019s experience.\n\n\u201cI would hope that the BitLicense is a ceiling rather than a floor for regulation,\u201d said John Olsen, the New York state lead for the Blockchain Association. \u201cIn some respects, it\u2019s worked very well, but enshrining in the country standards of that magnitude, I think, would force a lot of companies to rethink domiciling in the United States simply because of the costs required to actually operate legally.\u201d"

        "title": "Stablecoin data points to 'healthy appetite' from bulls and possible Bitcoin rally to $25K - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) rallied 11% between Jan. 20 and Jan. 21, reaching the $23,000 level and shattering bears' expectations for a pullback to $20,000. Even more notable is the move brought demand from Asia-based retail investors, according to data from a key stablecoin premium indicator.\n\nTraders should note that the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index also gained 5.1% between Jan. 20 and Jan. 23, fueled by investors\u2019 hope in China reopening for business after its COVID-19 lockdowns and weaker-than-expected economic data in the U.S. and the Eurozone.\n\nAnother bit of bullish information came on Jan. 20 after U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller reinforced the market expectation of a 25 basis point interest rate increase in February. A handful of heavyweight companies are expected to report their latest quarterly earnings this week to complete the puzzle, including Microsoft, IBM, Visa, Tesla and Mastercard.\n\nIn essence, the central bank is aiming for a \u201csoft landing,\u201c or a controlled decline of the economy, with fewer job openings and less inflation. However, if companies struggle with their balance sheets due to the increased cost of capital, earnings tend to nosedive and ultimately layoffs will be much higher than anticipated.\n\nOn Jan. 23, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode pointed out that long-term Bitcoin investors held losing positions for over a year, so those are likely more resilient to future adverse price movements.\n\nLet's look at derivatives metrics to better understand how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nThe Asia-based stablecoin premium nears the FOMO area\n\nThe USD Coin (USDC) premium is a good gauge of China-based crypto retail trader demand. It measures the difference between China-based peer-to-peer trades and the United States dollar.\n\nExcessive buying demand tends to pressure the indicator above fair value at 103%, and during bearish markets, the stablecoin\u2019s market offer is flooded, causing a 4% or higher discount.\n\nUSDC peer-to-peer vs. USD/CNY. Source: OKX\n\nCurrently, the USDC premium stands at 103.5%, up from 98.7% on Jan. 19, signaling higher demand for stablecoin buying from Asian investors. The movement coincided with Bitcoin\u2019s 11% daily gain on Jan. 20 and indicates moderate FOMO by retail traders as BTC price approached $23,000.\n\nPro traders are not particularly excited after the recent gain\n\nThe long-to-short metric excludes externalities that might have solely impacted the stablecoin market. It also gathers data from exchange clients\u2019 positions on the spot, perpetual and quarterly futures contracts, thus offering better information on how professional traders are positioned.\n\nThere are occasional methodological discrepancies between different exchanges, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.\n\nExchanges' top traders Bitcoin long-to-short ratio. Source: Coinglass\n\nThe first trend one can spot is Huobi and Binance\u2019s top traders being extremely skeptical of the recent rally. Those whales and market makers did not change their long-to-short levels over the last week, meaning they are not confident about buying above $20,500, but they are unwilling to open short (bear) positions.\n\nInterestingly, top traders at OKX reduced their net longs (bull) until Jan. 20 but drastically changed their positions during the latest phase of the bull run. Looking at a longer, three-week time frame, their current 1.05 long-to-short ratio remains lower than the 1.18 seen on Jan. 7.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners\u2019 worst days may have passed, but a few key hurdles remain\n\nBears are shy, providing an excellent opportunity for bull runs\n\nThe 3.5% stablecoin premium in Asia indicates a higher appetite from retail traders. Additionally, the top traders\u2019 long-to-short indicator shows no demand increase from shorts even as Bitcoin reached its highest level since August.\n\nFurthermore, the $335 million liquidation in short (bear) BTC futures contracts between Jan. 19 and Jan. 20 signals that sellers continue to use excessive leverage, setting up the perfect storm for another leg of the bull run.\n\nUnfortunately, Bitcoin price continues to be heavily dependent on the performance of stock markets. Considering how resilient BTC has been during the uncertainties regarding the bankruptcy of Digital Currency Group\u2019s Genesis Capital, the odds favor a rally toward $24,000 or $25,000.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s mining industry has been relatively stable compared to the bearish price action and the tumultuous fallout of exchanges and lending companies.\n\nThe network\u2019s hash rate dipped slightly toward the end of 2022, primarily due to an unprecedented blizzard in the U.S., and has since recovered strongly to surpass its previous peak above 270 EH/s. It was particularly encouraging to see that the hash rate was holding well above summer 2022 lows, despite the aftermath of the FTX collapse.\n\nBitcoin 7-day average hash rate. Source: Glassnode\n\nHowever, despite the recent robustness in a variety of metrics, the mining industry faces many challenges that will likely restrict its growth moving forward. The hurdles include low profitability, a threat from a new generation of efficient machines and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which will slash block rewards by half.\n\nBTC mining remains a stressed industry\n\nWhile the hash rate of Bitcoin's network has improved, miners are still under a lot of stress due to low profitability. The earnings of Bitcoin miners have shrunk to one-third of their value from the peak. Before the May 2022 price collapse, miners made more than $0.22 daily per TH/s, a figure which has now dropped to $0.07.\n\nThe percentage share of small-sized miners with breakeven prices above $25,000 has dropped from 80% in 2019 to 2% by 2022, which is a positive sign of an end to miner capitulation.\n\nThe sustainability of mid-sized miners with breakeven prices between $20,000 and $25,000 depends on the capital efficiency of participants. The struggle for them is to survive until the bullish trend commences, hoping to benefit from the next bullish cycle.\n\nThe significant drop in prices of mid-sized machines suggests that their demand has slowed down. According to CoinShares, reducing machine prices will allow capital-rich entities to \u201creduce their capital expense cost per TH/s and increase output without incurring additional ongoing cash-costs\u201d by buying hardware at a cheap rate. However, this will come at the expense of existing miners, which will likely restrict the industry's growth as a whole.\n\nAverage price of Bitcoin ASIC mining machines. Source: Hashrate Index\n\nMoreover, the firms with weak financials will also not be able to take advantage of the slowdown by raising debt, especially as central banks are hiking borrowing interest rates globally.\n\nIndependent research firm The Bitcoin Mining Block Post arrived at a similar conclusion about the industry\u2019s growth in 2023. Their analysts predict that the cost of miners \u201cwill move sideways and gradually trend upwards\u201d as it did in 2020.\n\nPressure from more capable ASICs and the upcoming BTC halving\n\nThe existing Bitcoin mining industry also faces significant challenges from the arrival of new and efficient machines and reduced rewards after the eventual halving in 2024.\n\nSince June 2021, more energy-efficient miners have been arriving, offering more than 100 TH/s per joule. This trend accelerated by Q2 2022 with the launch of new hardware equipment that had more than twice the efficiency of existing miners at the time. The breakeven prices of some of these miners are below $15,000.\n\nThe launch dates of miners with their power ratings. Source: Hashrate Index\n\nThe increase in efficiency will likely flatten out for the next couple of years due to limitations in microprocessor chip size. The most efficient miner produced by Bitmain, the S19 XP, has a 5 nm chip. Going below this size significantly increases the cost and risk of production errors.\n\nStill, as more of these types of equipment flood the market, the mining difficulty for existing players will increase and slowly drive them out. Thus, only competitive miners who can successfully expand and sustain operations will survive this phase.\n\nOn top of that, the miners will also have to prepare for the March 2024 halving event. CoinShares research pointed out that, given how halving will directly impact the miners, \u201ca potential strategy by mining companies may be to focus on reducing operating expenses above their cash-costs (including overhead, debt, hosting, etc.).\u201d\n\nWill miners realize profits in 2023?\n\nThe above data suggests that the worst days of miner capitulation could be finished. However, the industry remains under considerable pressure with regard to the current challenge of BTC accumulation.\n\nMiners continue to be prominent sellers in the market. An update from Coinbase Institutional on Jan. 19 stated that \u201ccrypto miners have started to be a bit more aggressive in selling.\u201d\n\nThe one-hop supply metric of Bitcoin miners is calculated from the total holdings of addresses that received tokens from mining pools. The indicator recorded a slight uptick in miner balance since the start of 2023. However, the total amount is still below 2019 lows, pointing to the challenges of a swift recovery unless the price favors miners.\n\nBitcoin one-hop miner supply. Source Coinmetrics\n\nThe fact that miners are continuing to sell with little hope of recovery in the short term could ruin the hopes of those expecting a parabolic run in 2023. Nevertheless, the good news is that the worst days of capitulation might be in the past. While slow and steady, miners can continue to grow, start accumulating again and help stage the next bullish rally.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "If CBDCs Are the Future of Money, What Does That Mean for Bitcoin? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The concept of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) -- digital money backed and issued by a central bank -- has been bubbling under the surface for the past few years. Now, it looks like it is ready to take off. The topic has already been debated at this year's World Economic Forum in Switzerland, and Bank of America (BAC 0.20%) just released a report suggesting that central bank digital currencies have the potential to revolutionize the global financial system. According to that report, these digital currencies represent \"the most significant technological advancement in the history of money.\"\n\nIn many ways, it's a question of when, not if, this transformational change is going to happen. According to the Atlantic Council, 114 nations around the world are exploring the introduction of CBDCs, and 18 of the G20 nations are in the advanced stages of launching one. So, if CBDCs are \"the future of money,\" what does that mean for Bitcoin (BTC 2.16%)? After all, wasn't Bitcoin supposed to be the future of money?\n\nScenario 1: CBDCs fail to take off\n\nWhile some nations -- such as China -- are well advanced in the pilot stages of their CBDC rollouts, other nations lag behind. The United States, notably, is far behind other nations when it comes to a CBDC rollout. In September 2022, the White House released a report titled \"Technical Possibilities for a Central Bank Digital Currency,\" and it's clear there are a lot of potential stumbling blocks. For one, as the paper points out, there is concern about equitable access and what impact a \"digital dollar\" might have on the average U.S. citizen. There are also a number of purely technological issues to sort out.\n\nFor reasons such as these, it's easy to imagine a scenario in which CBDCs never really get off the ground, and Bitcoin emerges as the winner when it comes to digital currencies. In many ways, that was the vision that many people had for Bitcoin at the outset. For more than a decade, crypto enthusiasts have argued that Bitcoin should replace traditional fiat currencies. From this perspective, CBDCs are just reinventing the wheel. If you buy into this narrative, then Bitcoin is a strong long-term buy and hold, because it will be the future of money.\n\nScenario 2: CBDCs and Bitcoin coexist\n\nOf course, it's possible central banks will manage to work out all the intricacies of CBDCs and launch them into the market. But that doesn't mean the average person is going to use them. For example, due to their complexity, CBDCs might just be used as tools to facilitate transactions between central banks and commercial banks, or as a way for the government to interact directly with citizens. But they might never go mainstream. For example, you might pay taxes with a CBDC account, or you might receive a stimulus check via a CBDC account, but you wouldn't shop online and pay for your purchases with your CBDC account.\n\nThis is probably the most likely scenario, simply because there could be a massive outcry from the private sector if any of today's major financial players -- such as commercial banks -- are disintermediated out of the system. And private citizens might respond quite negatively if they think CBDCs are being used by central banks to gain sensitive information or data about them, such as their precise spending patterns.\n\nScenario 3: CBDCs replace Bitcoin\n\nIn this scenario, CBDCs become a huge hit, people realize the limitations of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and cash disappears. In this potential future, the past decade will be seen as just a period of experimentation with digital currencies. Historians will say that Bitcoin helped pave the way for national CBDCs, but lament the fact that the original crypto has largely been relegated to the dustbin of history.\n\nThe possibility of a course of events like this may be a reason why some predict that Bitcoin will eventually go to zero. They realize the immense forces at work in the financial system, and the need for central banks and sovereign governments to retain their authority and power for this system to work. If you believe in the likelihood of this scenario, then Bitcoin is not a suitable long-term investment option, because regulators will eventually find a way to limit its scale and reach.\n\nIs Bitcoin the future of money?\n\nI'm bullish both short term and long term on Bitcoin. If you read through the technical papers about CBDCs, it's striking how cryptocurrencies already solve many of the problems that CBDCs are supposed to solve. For example, one big issue is financial inclusion, or the need to include everyone in a new digital financial system. What easier way is there than by empowering people to create their own mobile blockchain wallets in order to hold Bitcoin, such as they are already doing in El Salvador?\n\nUltimately, digital currencies have the potential to revolutionize the global financial system, as Bank of America suggests. The only question is who will be the ultimate winners here. Right now, I'm putting my full faith in Bitcoin. Governments are good at many things, but not at financial innovation."

        "content": "This week Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to a 2023 high at $23,100 and the move followed a notable recovery in traditional markets, especially the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, which gained 2.9% on Jan. 20.\n\nEconomic data continues to boost investors\u2019 hope that the United States Federal Reserve will reduce the pace and length of interest rate hikes. For instance, sales of previously owned homes fell 1.5% in December, the 11th consecutive decline after high mortgage rates in the United States severely impacted demand.\n\nOn Jan. 20, Google announced that it would lay off 12,000 workers, more than 6% of its global workforce. The bad news continues to trigger buying activity on risk assets, but Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, chief U.S. equity strategist at JPMorgan, expects weaker earnings guidance to \u201cput downward pressure\" on the stock market.\n\nThe fear of recession increased on Jan. 20 after Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said that a soft recession should be tolerated if it meant bringing inflation down.\n\nSome analysts have pegged Bitcoin\u2019s gains to a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection \u2014 allowing the troubled Genesis Capital to seek the reorganization of debts and its business activities. But, more importantly, the move decreases the risk of a fire sale on Grayscale Investments assets, including the $13.3 billion trust fund Grayscale GBTC.\n\nLet\u2019s look at derivatives metrics to understand better how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.\n\nBitcoin margin longs dropped after the pump to $21,000\n\nMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because it allows investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.\n\nFor example, one can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only short the cryptocurrency as they bet on its price declining. Unlike futures contracts, the balance between margin longs and shorts isn't always matched.\n\nOKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKX\n\nThe above chart shows that OKX traders\u2019 margin lending ratio increased from Jan. 12 to Jan. 16, signaling that professional traders increased their leverage longs as Bitcoin gained 18%.\n\nHowever, the indicator reversed its trend as the excessive leverage, 35 times larger for buying activity on Jan. 16, retreated to a neutral-to-bullish level on Jan. 20.\n\nCurrently at 15, the metric favors stablecoin borrowing by a wide margin and indicates that shorts are not confident about building bearish leveraged positions.\n\nStill, such data does not explain whether pro traders became less bullish or decided to reduce their leverage by depositing additional margin. Hence, one should analyze options markets to understand if the sentiment has changed.\n\nOptions traders are neutral despite the recent rally\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign whenever arbitrage desks and market makers are overcharging for upside or downside protection.\n\nThe indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put options premium is higher than risk call options.\n\nIn short, the skew metric will move above 10% if traders fear a Bitcoin price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 10% skew.\n\nBitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nAs displayed above, the 25% delta skew reached its lowest level in more than 12 months on Jan. 15. Option traders were finally paying a premium for bullish strategies instead of the opposite.\n\nRelated: Genesis bankruptcy case scheduled for first hearing\n\nCurrently, at minus 2%, the delta skew signals that investors are pricing similar odds for bull and bear cases, which is somewhat less optimistic than expected considering the recent rally toward $22,000.\n\nDerivatives data puts the bullish case in check as buyers using stablecoin margin significantly reduced their leverage and option markets are pricing similar risks for either side. On the other hand, bears have not found a level where they would be comfortable opening short positions by borrowing Bitcoin on margin markets.\n\nTraditional markets continue to play a crucial role in setting the trend, but Bitcoin bulls have no reason to fear as long as derivatives metrics remain healthy.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "How to Buy Bitcoin 2023: Complete Guide to The Best Options - Blockonomi",
        "content": "Back in the day, acquiring Bitcoin with a debit or credit card used to be extremely challenging; even tech-savvy individuals experienced great difficulties with acquiring the lucrative cryptocurrency.\n\nThankfully, a lot of reputable and trusted exchange platforms are now available, like eToro, Binance, Coinbase and CoinMama. These exchanges allow for bitcoins to easily be purchased with credit or debit cards.\n\nIndividuals will need to create a bitcoin wallet before they can utilize the full potential of bitcoin exchanges. Wallets are quite easy to make and can be stored on a phone, on a computer, online, or in a physical way, such as a piece of paper or some sort of cold storage method.\n\nAnother thing to bare in mind when purchasing your bitcoin, is the fees that the exchange will charge yon each transaction \u2013 make sure you look at what the charges will be and compare them across the exchanges we have listed below to be sure of getting the best deal with your bitcoin purchase.\n\nIn this post we have put together a list of the most reputable online exchanges for purchasing bitcoin using your debit or credit card. There are also crypto-only exchanges that could be a better fit for crypto traders. While it is relatively harder to transfer your fiat currency into cryptos, making the jump from one crypto exchange to another is simple.\n\nThe are numerous crypto exchanges out there will all offer something different to their clients. No matter what you want to do in the world of cryptocurrencies, this post will help you find the right tools for the job!\n\nCoinbase: Our Top Pick & Easiest Method\n\nCoinbase is the globe\u2019s largest exchange platform. Currently, the platform is fully functional in the United States, Canada, Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Singapore.\n\nThe platform allows users to instantly purchase bitcoins with a credit or debit card. You simply need to create an account on the platform, confirm some personal details, and log in.\n\nCoinbase may be one of the best choices for people that live in the US, as they are up to date on all the tax laws that US citizens and residents need to follow. Some users were upset that Coinbase shared all its clients\u2019 trading history with US tax authorities, but this is necessary for any company that wants to interact with the US financial system.\n\nIt is actually a benefit for people that have to follow US tax law, as the penalties that the US Internal Revenue Service can impose on late taxes are severe. Anyone who lives in the US and trades cryptos needs to be well-educated in their tax responsibilities.\n\nOccasionally, Coinbase may prompt users to upload some form of government-issued identification \u2013 this can be in the form of Driving License, Passport etc. It is recommended to verify your account with as much ID as you can this then increase your purchase limits, allowing you to buy more bitcoin with credit or debit card.\n\nAs time goes on, you will also find that your purchasing limits increase, for much larger orders ( in the thousands ) you will need to add your bank details and send a wire transfer.\n\nOnce the verification process is complete, users can navigate over to their profile and find an option to add payment methods to their account. Users can link their PayPal account, bank account, or debit/credit card. Keep in mind that purchases made directly through bank accounts take up to five days to get verified.\n\nAll the cryptocurrencies purchased through Coinbase are sent directly to your Coinbase wallet. The platform doesn\u2019t charge any fees for the use of debit cards. However, it does charge a small fee of 3.7 percent per credit card transaction.\n\nFor further information, take a look at our full Coinbase review.\n\nVisit Coinbase\n\nCoinMama\n\nCoinMama is a large bitcoin brokerage that allows users to acquire coins with their debit or credit cards. It is based in Israel and has a global client base. The platform issues small fees for transactions. To make up for this, however, the limits for how many bitcoins a user can buy are much higher in comparison to Coinbase.\n\nUsers can acquire up to $5,000 of coins per day or up to $20,000 per month. All users need to do to use CoinMama is to set up an account, log in, and navigate to the profile page section to fill in personal information.\n\nFollowing this, users will be introduced to a page that allows them to select how many bitcoins they would like to purchase, and once a fitting amount has been selected, users will be allowed to add their preferred payment methods and bitcoin addresses.\n\nUsers will also be required to verify their phone number and email address. CoinMama does not require most users to upload their government-issued ID. After completing the aforementioned steps and passing the verification process, users will be able to acquire bitcoins through CoinMama.\n\nOne of the things that sets CoinMama apart from other exchanges is its high purchase limits, and willingness to deal with just about anyone. It has very few restrictions on who can use the exchange, which is good news for people who don\u2019t live in North America or the EU.\n\nCoin Mama has a great looking platform that will allow its clients to trade in numerous major and minor cryptos. On the downside, it isn\u2019t the cheapest exchange out there.\n\nSome of the larger exchanges that allow the use of credit cards to purchase cryptos aren\u2019t always going to be competitive with crypto only exchanges. Looking into your options for crypto-crypto trading could make sense if you plan on trading a lot.\n\nFind out more in our full review.\n\nVisit Coinmama\n\nBitPanda\n\nBitPanda is a large and trusted bitcoin exchange platform based out of Austria. Its biggest drawback is that it only offers its services to residents of Europe. It is fully automated, which makes transactions fast and secure.\n\nThe platform also allows users to acquire Ethereum. BitPanda bares the same verification processes as the other major exchanges. However, the purchase limits for credit card transactions are over $2,000 a day, with up to $75,000 per month.\n\nOther payment methods allow purchases of up to $10,000 per day or $300,000 per month. Transaction fees are also quite low, making BitPanda a great option to buy bitcoins with credit or debit cards for citizens of European countries.\n\nBitPanda will allow you to hold GBP, USD, EUR, CHF, as well as 25 different cryptos in the same account. Being able to hold numerous fiat and cryptos in the same account is convenient, and could be useful for people that want a lot of flexibility when it comes to their asset structure.\n\nIf you plan on buying a lot of crypto at BitPanda, the exchange will probably want to know where the money is coming from. Austria has a heavily regulated banking system, and large amounts of money passing through your account will attract attention.\n\nOverall BitPanda is worth considering if you want to buy a bunch of crypto with a credit or debit card, and live in the countries it serves. BitPanda also supports loads of other payment and withdraw options, like SEPA, Neteller and Skrill.\n\nRead our Bitpanda review here.\n\nVisit BitPanda\n\nCEX.IO\n\nCEX.io is one of the world\u2019s oldest bitcoin exchanges that operates in the United States, Europe, and certain South American countries.\n\nCEX.io is wildly popular and quite well trusted by the cryptocurrency community. It was one of the most powerful forces in crypto mining for a short time, but today the company focuses on trading cryptos. It offers a range of services and levels of verification.\n\nTrading fees on the platform are fairly low. However, the verification process is more extensive than on other exchanges. Occasionally, users may be prompted to upload a picture of themselves along with some form of government-issued ID. CEX.io operates under the same principles as most other popular bitcoin exchanges.\n\nIt is important to understand that CEX.io offers both a cryptocurrency brokerage service, and an exchange. The fees that CEX.io charges on its brokerage platform can be high, but the fees for trading cryptos with them are much lower.\n\nThere are also restrictions in place that prevent people from using CEX.io. Depending on where you live, you may or may not be able to use certain funding options, or use the platform at all.\n\nIf you are from one of the following countries, you can\u2019t buy cryptos from CEX.io with a credit card:\n\nAfghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iceland and Vietnam.\n\nIf you are from one of the following countries, you won\u2019t be able to fund your account with a wire transfer:\n\nAfghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Eritrea, Ethiopia, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Tunisia, Turkey, Vietnam, Yemen, Zimbabwe, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Kenya, Liberia, Libya and Guinea.\n\nResidents of the following US States will be denied an account at CEX.io:\n\nAlabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Guam, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.\n\nAs long as you aren\u2019t on those lists, you should be able to use any of the tools that CEX.io has. You will need to go though an extensive verification process to deal in larger amounts of cryptos, but that is becoming the norm at most exchanges that deal with fiat currency.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have any direct experience with the customer service department at CEX.io, is has gained a reputation for being less than helpful. Be sure to dig into the information that is available online before deciding on a crypto exchange, so you are making an informed decision.\n\nFull Review of CEX located here.\n\nVisit CEX\n\nChangelly\n\nChangelly is a cryptocurrency exchange which is associated with converting one type of currency to another. It also allows you to buy most of the major cryptos with a credit card, and have the cryptocurrency sent to your crypto wallet.\n\nIts platform is really easy to use and offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies to choose from. They also offer purchasing of some currencies in USD and they accept payment via Mastercard or VISA so they provide an easy way to obtain bitcoin from your bank or credit card facilities.\n\nChangelly is a very trusted exchange with a \u201cGreat\u201d rating on TrustPilot, having been around for over 2 years now with no problems. Changelly is easy to signup for with just email verification required which means you can your chosen currency in your wallet fairly quickly.\n\nThe process of registering and buying cryptos from Changelly is straightforward, but you should have some sort of hardware or software wallet, and know how to send cryptos to it.\n\nChangelly has connections with some of the biggest crypto exchanges operating today, like Bittrex and Poloniex. By having access to crypto market makers, Changelly offers its customers leading rates on purchases and exchange, as well as deep liquidity for big orders.\n\nYou will need to be able to verify your identity to use a credit or debit card with Changelly, but it may be as easy as entering a SMS code for smaller purchases after you supply basic personal information.\n\nIf you want to deal with an established crypto exchange that offers some of the best rates in the industry, it is worth checking out Changelly.\n\nOur review of Changelly is here.\n\nVisit Changelly\n\nCrypto-Only Exchanges Could be Useful as Well\n\nOnce you own cryptos, there are a number of exchanges out there to choose from.\n\nThe following exchanges don\u2019t offer direct purchase of cryptos with credit or debit cards (though that may change at any time, so check before you dismiss them outright), but they do offer great trading platforms and low rates on crypto trading.\n\nOne of the most important things to consider is what your goals in the crypto world are. Some people just want to grab a few tokens and hold onto them for the long term. If you are looking to make a long-term investment in cryptos, then buying a few with a credit or debit card and storing them on a secure wallet is fine.\n\nThe fees that you pay to buy and transfer cryptos won\u2019t really matter in the grand scheme, as your expectation for price movements is far higher than a few percent. If you are looking to trade cryptos actively, then it is far more important to look into the fees that an exchange charges.\n\nCrypto only exchanges can have extremely low rates, and some also offer token pairs that are difficult to find elsewhere.\n\nBinance\n\nBinance have grown rapidly into one of the world\u2019s most used crypto exchanges. It was founded in China, but is now serving its clients from the crypto-wonderland of Malta.\n\nOne of the biggest selling points for Binance is the fact that it offers two kinds of trading platforms. It has a basic platform for people that are new to crypto trading, and an advanced platform for traders that need more functionality.\n\nLike most crypto-only exchanges, there is little in the way of KYC for new clients that don\u2019t need to trade in large amounts of cryptos. A level 1 account will get you a daily withdrawal limit of 2BTC, and a level 2 account will earn you a withdrawal limit of 100BTC.\n\nA level 2 account will require photo ID, and there are higher withdrawal limits available for people that need one. If you need to move a lot of crypto through Binance just drop them a line, and they will let you know what you need to provide in terms of ID verification.\n\nBinance\u2019s fees are super low, and can also be discounted by using their token. If you want to learn more about the exchange, check out our review right here.\n\nVisit Binance\n\nNote: If you are in the USA, you will need to register with Binance.US\n\nVisit Binance US\n\nBittrex\n\nBittrex still doesn\u2019t accept credit or debit cards, but it will allow you to deposit money in USD via a wire transfer. The exchange was founded in 2014 and is based in Seattle, Washington. It has definitely been in the top 10 global exchanges when it comes to daily turnover, and has a good reputation for customer service.\n\nThe great part about Bittrex is the sheer number of BTC pairs it supports. There are at least 450 BTC pairs on the exchange, and also some other options for people that want to trade in other major cryptos. While the company won\u2019t allow its clients to use credit or debit cards, it does offer bank transfers at good rates.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind with Bittrex is that if you want to fund your account with fiat currency, there is a minimum deposit of $10,000. That amount might seem high to some people, and there are lots of other options out there if you need an exchange who will take a smaller amount of money to get started.\n\nBittrex was founded by a software engineer who worked at Amazon and Blackberry that specializes in data security. The exchange has a reputation for keeping its clients cryptos safe, and the trading platform it offers is on par with any of the other crypto exchanges on this list.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Bittrex, check out our full review here.\n\nPoloniex\n\nPoloniex has established itself as one of the foremost North American crypto exchanges. In addition to having a large daily turnover and deep liquidity, Poloniex was taken over by Circle, which is backed in part by investment bank Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhile it is a great exchange that offers crypto traders a lot, Poloniex isn\u2019t going to be right for everyone. It is strictly a crypto-only exchange that doesn\u2019t deal with fiat currency at all. That means that you can only fund it with cryptos, not bank transfers or any kind of credit or debit card.\n\nPoloniex does offer its clients Tether, which is a stablecoin that is tied to the US dollar. It isn\u2019t a perfect system, and the value of Tether does vary from day to day. If fiat currency isn\u2019t a concern, and you are happy to deal solely in cryptocurrencies, Poloniex is one of the best exchanges out there to learn more about.\n\nOn the plus side, Poloniex was the first crypto exchange to be regulated by the SEC and FINRA. The USA is one of the strictest countries when it comes to financial regulations, and that puts Poloniex a step above offshore exchanges that have far less regulatory oversight to deal with.\n\nThe trading platform that Poloniex offers its clients is geared toward experienced traders, and it might not be a perfect fit for everyone. Its fee structure is extremely competitive, and the exchange offers deep liquidity and a huge range of tokens.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about Poloniex, have a look at this in-depth review (LINK).\n\nHADAX\n\nHADAX is an interesting idea from Huobi. If cryptos are the wild west of the financial world, HADAX is the unknown frontier of the crypto wilderness. Huobi created the platform to allow the trade of smaller tokens, which can be extremely volatile.\n\nIf you are looking for an exchange to trade in major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH or XRP, HADAX probably isn\u2019t the exchange for you. The platform was set up to allow its users to vote on which tokens should be listed via HT tokens, which makes the listing process both decentralized and autonomous.\n\nHADAX doesn\u2019t deal in fiat currency, and will only accept deposits in cryptos. On the plus side deposits are accepted with no charge, and the trading fees on the platform are low. If you are looking to get into some extremely speculative digital assets, HADAX could be worth a look.\n\nFinding Other Exchanges\n\nBefore jumping on any exchange that you come across selling bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s vital that you do your due diligence pertaining to the platform. Make sure that the platform you are looking to use has a good and trusted reputation, and read reviews.\n\nThere are many scammers out there, as well as shady exchanges. It is not uncommon for unscrupulous bitcoin exchanges to steal their users\u2019 credit card information and other sensitive data.\n\nIf you are looking for other options for the purchase of Bitcoin, you are in luck. There are many ways to get Bitcoin if you don\u2019t want to share much of your personal data online, though you will need to jump though a few hoops to make the deal happen.\n\nFeel Like Using Cash to Buy Bitcoin?\n\nOne of the biggest selling points for Bitcoin was its near total anonymity. Now that most exchanges where you can buy and trade cryptos are going to ask for some form of ID verification (especially if you want to buy your cryptos with fiat currency), it is much harder to get into Bitcoin without sharing personal information.\n\nWhile it is nearly impossible to buy Bitcoins without leaving some sort of transactional evidence behind, there are options for people that want to buy cryptos with cash. Here are a few ways you can go right from cash into cryptocurrency, as long as you are willing to walk the path less traveled.\n\nBuy at a Bitcoin ATM\n\nBitcoin ATMs have been installed in many places, especially in North America and the EU. While turning a bunch of cash into Bitcoin with crypto ATMs isn\u2019t going to be easy, they can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptos with relative anonymity.\n\nThe first major downside of buying Bitcoin in person is that most crypto ATMs have a limit on how much can be bought at one time. If you only want to pick up a few hundred dollars or euros worth of BTC or ETH they could be a good option, but stashing tens of thousands of dollars away on the sly with crypto ATMs isn\u2019t going to be easy.\n\nAdditionally, there are almost certainly going to be people and cameras around wherever a crypto ATM is located. The people working at the store will probably remember that you show up every few days with a stack of cash to buy cryptos, or at the very least a security camera will keep a record of it.\n\nWhile certainly not a perfect solution for everyone, Bitcoin ATMs are a viable options to turn your cash directly into cryptos. If there are a lot of them where you live, you might be able to do a few laps around the metro area and pick up an appreciable amount of crypto on the DL.\n\nLocalBitcoins\n\nLocalBitcoins is an interesting platform. Started in 2012 in Finland as an easy way for people to trade Bitcoin on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis, it remains a great tool for people that want to bypass the cryptos exchanges.\n\nThe process of using LocalBitcoins is pretty simple. All you have to do is open an account, and provide some basic personal information. There are a number of ways to pay for the Bitcoins, including \u2018cash in the mail\u2019, which opens up a whole range of bartering options.\n\nRemember, LocalBitcoins is a P2P exchange, so it is important to make sure and research the counterparty you are considering a trade with. Make sure they have done a lot of deals, and haven\u2019t raised any red flags with previous clients.\n\nThe fees that LocalBitcoins charges are generally quite low, and are usually only applied to the person that took out the advert. On the flip side, the rate that Bitcoins are sold at on the platform tends to be above market rate, and the amount of liquidity if obviously much lower than a crypto exchange.\n\nIf you want to learn more about LocalBitcoins, check out our full review here.\n\nVisit LocalBitcoins\n\nWrapping up \u2013 Final Thoughts\n\nWhile there certainly are risks involved with purchasing bitcoins from exchanges using your bank cards, it\u2019s also one of the easiest ways to acquire this cryptocurrency.\n\nIn fact, it is comparable to how regular shopping is done online. However, buying bitcoins with credit and debit cards usually entails high fees and can leave buyers exposed to risk. Fees for purchases made with bank accounts are generally lower.\n\nKeep in mind that bitcoin purchases on exchanges with stolen credit or debit cards are impossible due to the verification processes that exchanges have put in place to protect buyers. Anonymous purchases of bitcoins are also impossible due to the verification processes.\n\nUnfortunately, pre-loaded debit or credit cards don\u2019t work on most popular exchanges. If you are in possession of a prepaid debit or credit card, you may have to refer to LocalBitcoins to purchase bitcoins.\n\nIndividuals should devote a lot of time to researching exchanges and platforms before buying any bitcoins. Due to the verification processes implemented on most, it would be truly terrible to have your personal information or government ID fall into the hands of some scammers or shady platform.\n\nIt\u2019s also highly recommended that users transfer their bitcoins from exchange platforms directly to their personal bitcoin wallets to keep acquired assets safe from theft.\n\nKeep in mind that you aren\u2019t limited to using one exchange. This means you can own accounts on all of the reputable exchanges, like Coinbase, BitPanda, CoinMama, LocalBitcoins, CEX.io and Changelly. This is perfect for users who feel restricted by exchange platform transaction limits."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency market was trading mixed on Monday as Dogecoin , Ethereum and Cardano were trading with gains, while Bitcoin, Solana and Litecoin were trading with cuts.Bitcoin fell 0.61% and held below the $22,800 mark, whereas Ethereum was comfortable above $1,600 levels.

The demand for BTC is mainly driven by institutional investors who are increasing their holdings in anticipation of the next bull run.

        "content": "The Bitcoin (BTC) logo lit up the night sky in Berlin this weekend, adorning Germany\u2019s tallest building with a giant orange B.\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nOn Jan. 21, the Bitcoin logo illuminated the Berliner Fernsehturm tower, also known as the TV Tower. German Bitcoiners took to Twitter and social media to share photos and videos of the illuminated logo, which was then shared by prominent Bitcoin Twitter accounts.\n\nThe man behind the B, a German Bitcoiner going by the name of Tilo, told Cointelegraph why the idea came to him:\n\n\u201cWe just want to call attention on Bitcoin! We\u2019re fans of guerilla actions like this and will keep on track.\u201c\n\nTilo is CEO of an events agency that will host the \u201cBest of Blockchain\u201d conference this year. He explained that the process is simple for setting up light displays: \u201cWhat you need is a mixer, power station, special Bitcoin logo.\u201d Tilo had tried the process at the end of last year, but it didn't go as planned. \u201cThe beamer I used was too weak,\u201d he explained.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Bitcoin logo or themes have been projected onto iconic buildings. In May 2021 in London, \u201cFiat is the bubble, Bitcoin is the pin,\u201d was projected onto the Bank of England.\n\nThe vigilante strikes again.\n\n\n\nLast night on the Bank of England pic.twitter.com/1XsBgW7e0I \u2014 Dominic Frisby (@DominicFrisby) May 3, 2021\n\nTilo had previously beamed Bitcoin slogans onto the iconic Berlin wall and had shared an inventory of products required to coordinate these sorts of lighting projections for those interested in trying it out. However, he cautions that these kind of \u201cadvertisements\u201d are not technically allowed, so it's best to tread carefully.\n\nThe Bitcoin B on the Berlin Wall. Source: Twitter\n\nWhile the Reddit group for Bitcoiners in Germany celebrated the event with a chain of comments saying \u201cNoice,\u201d the subreddit for Berlin residents took a different approach. One commenter criticized the light display as \u201clight pollution,\u201d whereas another hoped that \u201cit [Bitcoin] never catches on.\u201d They continued:\n\n\u201cBitcoin is turbo capitalism without limits and morals, every six months disguised in a different guise and motto.\u201d\n\nThe price per Bitcoin now sits comfortably in the $20k range, having surged from the mid-teens, while network security recently hit all-time highs. The hash rate, or the number of searches performed by Bitcoin miners per second, recently punched through to 300 exahashes per second.\n\nRelated: Coinbase CEO urges Bitcoin legal tender for Brazil, Argentina \u2014 Reaction\n\nThe number of Bitcoin users worldwide has trended into the millions, while the developing world is beginning to research and take advantage of Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized and sovereign properties. In Germany\u2019s capital, Berliners can use Bitcoin to pay for Subway sandwiches over the Lightning Network."

        "content": "Cathie Wood's Ark Invest offloaded a chunk of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares since November's Bitcoin (BTC) price lows, the latest data shows.\n\nCathie Wood's Ark short-term cautious on GBTC\n\nArk Invest added 450,272 GBTC shares worth $4.5 million to its ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) in November 2022. At the time, GBTC was trading in the $7.46-$9.48 range versus $12.25 in January 2023.\n\nGBTC price, of course, recovered alongside Bitcoin, rising roughly 40% from its November lows. The recovery in January also helped reduce the GBTC \u201cdiscount\u201d from nearly 50% to 40%, according to YCharts.\n\nGBTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nInterestingly, the share price rebound coincided with a reduction in ARKW's GBTC holdings by 500,000 shares, suggesting profit-taking in the short term.\n\nGBTC shares (purple) in Ark's ETF versus its price (orange). Source: Cathiesark.com\n\nMoreover, Ark's reduction in shares since November appears in line with its officially \u201cbearish view\u201d on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, as mentioned in its December report, which stated that:\n\n\u201cThe Digital Currency Group (DCG) appears to be one of the biggest questions marks in the crypto industry at this time.\u201c\n\nThe company also expressed concerns about Genesis Global, a cryptocurrency lender owned by DCG. Genesis filed for bankruptcy while claiming $1 billion to $10 billion in liabilities to over 100,000 creditors.\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale has been unable to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF following rejections from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As Cointelegraph reported, an approval from the SEC could reset GBTC's discount to zero.\n\nNonetheless, as of Jan. 23, GBTC's share weight in Ark's portfolio has actually increased to 0.52% compared to its November 2022 low of 0.35%.\n\nGBTC shares' weight (purple) across Ark ETFs. Source: Cathiesark.com\n\nArk adds $17.6M in Coinbase stock\n\nArk's selling of GBTC shares in the past weeks coincided with accumulation of Coinbase (COIN) shares.\n\nCathie Wood's ARKW added 320,000 COIN shares (about $17.6 million) in 2023. As a result, the Coinbase stock's weight in Ark Invest's combined ETF portfolios has reached nearly 3.62% on Jan. 23 versus 2.73% at the start of this year.\n\nCOIN shares (purple) in Ark's ETF versus its price (orange). Source: Cathiesark.com\n\nOverall, Ark appears to be only increasing its exposure to the Bitcoin market, particularly as Wood is well known for her consistent $1 million by 2030 BTC price prediction.\n\nCan the GBTC price rally continue?\n\nSimilarly, Greenery Financial, an investment strategy firm, confirmed that it had shifted its GBTC exposure to ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) due to the above-mentioned risks around DCG.\n\n\u201cAny bad news, be it Cathie Wood selling out of GBTC or DCG going bankrupt, will spark the same fears and doubt - of uncertainty - and likely cause an expansion of the discount once again, \" the firm warned in its SeekingAlpha note, saying:\n\n\u201cWith Bitcoin having no real catalyst in the short term and plenty of potential downside catalysts, there are plenty of risks here from the NAV side as well.\u201c\n\nNonetheless Bitcoin and GBTC prices may keep on rallying through Q1 from a technical perspective.\n\nOn the daily chart, GBTC has reclaimed its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave in the chart below) near $9.68 as support.\n\nRelated: Grayscale files brief in ETF suit against SEC, oral arguments may come within months\n\nUpward momentum could see it test the 200-day EMA (the blue wave) near $15 if it continues to float above the 50-day EMA wave, similar to what happened in March-April 2022.\n\nGBTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe technical upside target falls in line with what Pat Tschosik, senior portfolio strategist at Ned Davis Research, predicted about the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.\n\nHe argued that GBTC price could not only double by mid-2023, but also narrow the extant discount gap with Bitcoin's spot price.\n\n\u201cWe recommend GBTC [\u2026] as a way to play Bitcoin because it has a \u2018potential NAV kicker rebate,\u2019 which not only means it would go up if Bitcoin goes up, but also closing its current large 35% rebate on NAV,\u201d Ned Davis Research said in a note to clients.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Crypto firms acted like banks, then collapsed like dominoes - The Associated Press",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Over the past few years, a number of companies have attempted to act as the cryptocurrency equivalent of a bank, promising lucrative returns to customers who deposited their bitcoin or other digital assets.\n\nIn a span of less than 12 months, nearly all of the biggest of those companies have failed spectacularly. Last week, Genesis filed Chapter 11, joining Voyager Digital, Celsius and BlockFi on the list of companies that have either filed for bankruptcy protection or gone out of business.\n\nThis subset of the industry grew as cryptocurrency enthusiasts were looking to build their own parallel world in finance untethered to traditional banking and government-issued currencies. But lacking safeguards, and without a government backstop, these companies failed in domino-like fashion. What started with one crypto company collapsing in May spilled over onto one crypto lending firm and then the next.\n\nFurther, government regulators started clamping down on crypto lending companies\u2019 ability to advertise their services, saying that their products should have been regulated by securities regulators.\n\nThe collapse is reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis, but on a much smaller scale. There are no worries that the collapse of these crypto firms will impact the broader economy.\n\nCrypto lending companies like Voyager, Genesis and BlockFi were trying to do what banks do in traditional finance: take in crypto deposits, give depositors a dividend on their stored crypto, and then make loans to earn a profit. It\u2019s what the banking industry has done for hundreds of years, but with government-sanctioned currencies.\n\nThe biggest drawback to crypto lending is the lack of safeguards. There is no deposit insurance, government stopgap, or even a privately run entity to protect depositors if their crypto bank were to fail. This was fine when crypto prices were moving higher because the collateral banks were accepting in exchange for the loans was increasing in value.\n\nDemand for crypto deposits was so high, firms were willing to pay a yield of 10% of more on depositors\u2019 crypto holdings.\n\nBut then crypto prices started falling and kept falling. Bitcoin, for instance, plunged from over $65,000 in November 2021 to below $17,000 last November. As a result, much of the underlying collateral these firms were holding became worth less than the loans they had issued, effectively making several \u201ccrypto banks\u201d insolvent.\n\nThe first two crypto lending firms to collapse were Celsius and Voyager Digital. The companies had been exposed to both falling crypto prices as well as risky loans made to crypto hedge funds like Three Arrows Capital, which was forced to liquidate and go out of business in June.\n\nBlockFi, another crypto lender, turned to then-crypto giant FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried for a rescue. Bankman-Fried gave BlockFi a financial lifeline, one of several moves that earned Bankman-Fried plaudits as a savior or financial backstop for the crypto industry.\n\nBut FTX\u2019s own bankruptcy in November, caused by high-risk lending to its affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research, caused BlockFi\u2019s financial lifeline to wither away. BlockFi\u2019s own bankruptcy became an inevitability. In a show of how intertwined these crypto lenders became, Genesis made billions in loans to Alameda.\n\nSaddled with bad loans, many of these high-tech firms experienced a very old phenomenon: depositors wanted their money back, and a bank run started.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT?\n\nThe tens of thousands of customers at these crypto lending firms are now waiting to see if their assets can be recovered or found in bankruptcy court, which could take months or even years. At Genesis, more than $900 million in customer funds are now locked up in bankruptcy.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether crypto lending will see a return any time soon. After FTX failed, crypto exchange giant Binance announced it would start its own fund to provide rescue financing for a crypto firm in trouble, an idea that has its origins in government-sponsored central banking or deposit insurance.\n\nFurther, the crypto industry seems to coming around to the idea of some sort of regulation, which would provide a minimum of safeguards to depositors or investors that does not exist at the moment. There were several bills pending in Congress last year, but with the change in control to the Republicans in the House of Representatives, it\u2019s not clear whether the broader GOP has an interest in regulating the crypto industry."

        "content": "While Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a strong price pump to kick off the new year, many industry pundits are not convinced the cryptocurrency will continue its upward trajectory \u2014 at least in the short to mid-term.\n\nThe impressive price surge \u2014 which saw BTC experience 14 days of consecutive price increases earlier this month \u2014 has called on many to consider whether the surge marks a significant \u201cbreakthrough\u201d or is indicative of a \u201cbull trap.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph on Jan. 23, James Edwards \u2014 a cryptocurrency analyst at Australian-based fintech firm Finder \u2014 said the argument for a \u201cbull trap\u201d is stronger, warning the recent surge could be \u201cshort-lived.\u201d\n\nHe stated that while the BTC price moved upwards over the weekend, the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 also made similar rallies:\n\n\u201cThis suggests to me that the rally in crypto is not unique, and instead part of a wider market uplift as inflation figures stall and a risk-on appetite appears to return to investments. So Bitcoin is just enjoying the effects of positive sentiment that originated elsewhere. This is likely to be short-lived.\u201d\n\nEdwards added that cryptocurrency markets still have some \u201csignificant hurdles to clear before a new bull market can begin.\u201d\n\nAmong those obstacles, he mentioned include the continued fallout over FTX\u2019s collapse and the recent Chapter 11 filing by Genesis on Jan. 19.\n\n\u201cAs such, we\u2019re going to see further sell-offs and downsizing as crypto firms adjust their balance sheets and dump tokens onto the market to cover debt and try to stay afloat,\u201d he explained.\n\nIn a statement to Cointelegraph, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone wasn\u2019t confident in the BTC price trajectory either, citing recessionary-like macroeconomic conditions as too big of a barrier for BTC to overcome.\n\n\u201cWith the world leaning into recession and most central banks tightening, I think the macroeconomic ebbing tide is still the primary headwind for Bitcoin and crypto prices.\u201d\n\nThe sentiment was also shared among some on Crypto Twitter, with cryptocurrency analyst and swing trader \u201cCapo of Crypto\u201d telling his 710,000 Twitter followers on Jan. 21 that BTC\u2019s push past resistance looks like \u201cthe biggest bull trap\u201d he has ever seen:\n\nI've been checking charts all this time, avoiding noise from Twitter. The way the upward movement is happening, the way htf resistances are being tested... it clearly looks manipulated, no real demand.\n\n\n\nOnce again, the biggest bull trap I've ever seen. But they won't trap me. \u2014 il Capo Of Crypto (@CryptoCapo_) January 21, 2023\n\nHowever, not all industry pundits were as bearish.\n\nCryptocurrency market analysis platform IncomeSharks appeared bullish, having shared a \u201cWall St. Cheat Sheet\u201d chart with its 379,300 Twitter followers on Jan. 22 making a mockery of the bears who think the latest price movements are indicative of a \u201cbull trap.\u201d\n\n#Bears at the Denial stage. \"It's just a bull trap\" \"It's all manipulation\". Waiting for the Panic part next... pic.twitter.com/Lo6nWyZPD2 \u2014 IncomeSharks (@IncomeSharks) January 22, 2023\n\nSem Agterberg, the CEO and co-founder of AI-based trading bot CryptoSea, also recently shared a flood of posts expressing positive sentiment toward BTC price action to his 431,700 Twitter followers, suggesting that a \u201cBULL FLAG BREAKOUT\u201d toward $25,000 may soon be on the cards.\n\nMeanwhile, others have refrained from making a forecast on the price, likely given the unpredictability of crypto markets.\n\nHere's my technical analysis of where Bitcoin's price is going. pic.twitter.com/cOFueErgGq \u2014 Dan Held (@danheld) January 21, 2023\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price consolidation opens the door for APE, MANA, AAVE and FIL to move higher\n\nAt the time of publication, Bitcoin was priced at $22,738, while the Crypto Fear and Greed Index was at \u201cNeutral\u201d with a score of 50 out of 100.\n\nThe cryptocurrency managed to break out of the \u201cFear\u201d zone on Jan. 13 \u2014 which was then scored at 31 \u2014 after the BTC price increased for seven consecutive days."

At its latest weekly candle close, BTC/USD traded at just above $22,700, marking its best performance since last summer.\n\nThereafter, the pair consolidated into the start of Monday, likewise retaining ground recovered over the week.\n\n\u201cLows swept, juicy highs above, would be the perfect time to put in a nice running flat before continuation up,\u201d trader Credible Crypto summarized about the short-term outlook.\n\nCredible Crypto\u2019s co is characteristic of some of the more bullish takes on the market, less concerned by the idea that the whole move may simply be a relief rally within a broader bearish structure.\n\n\u201cTotal market capitalization broke through the 200-Day EMA,\u201d a similarly optimistic Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, Cointelegraph contributor and CEO of trading firm Eight, added over the weekend, referring to exponential moving averages.\n\n\u201cGood signs for crypto, as continuation seems likely.

        "content": "After nearly a 20% rally last week, Bitcoin (BTC) is on track to end this week with gains of roughly 10%. Bitcoin\u2019s rally has improved sentiment and attracted buying in several altcoins. This sent the total crypto market capitalization firmly above the $1 trillion mark.\n\nThe strong recovery in Bitcoin has startled several analysts who remain skeptical about the rally. Some believe that the current rise is a dead cat bounce that will reverse direction sharply, while others see similarities between the current rally and the 2018 bear market recovery.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAlthough traders should be ready for any eventuality, the pace of the rise in Bitcoin does point to a possible major bottom. There are likely to be bumps down the road but the dips are likely to be aggressively purchased by traders.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s sustained recovery may encourage buying in select altcoins.\n\nLet\u2019s study the charts of Bitcoin and select altcoins that are showing strength in the near term.\n\nBTC/USDT\n\nBitcoin climbed above the $21,650 overhead resistance on Jan. 20, indicating the resumption of the up-move. This shows that demand remains strong at higher levels.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls pushed the price above the $22,800 resistance on Jan. 21 but failed to build upon the breakout as seen from the long wick on the day\u2019s candlestick.\n\nWhile the upsloping moving averages indicate that bulls are in command, the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought territory warrants caution. It suggests that a few days of consolidation or minor correction is possible.\n\nHowever, when a new uptrend starts, the RSI sometimes tends to remain in the overbought zone and frustrates the bears. If that happens, the uptrend may continue without a major pullback and the pair could reach $25,211.\n\nOn the downside, the first support is at $21,480. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that the bulls are buying on every minor dip. That could increase the likelihood of a rally to $25,211.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls are trying to flip the $22,800 level into support. If the price continues higher and soars above $23,271, the bullish momentum could pick up and the pair may rush toward $25,211.\n\nIf the price turns down and breaks below $22,600, the pair could slide to the 20- day exponential moving average (EMA). This level may act as a support but if bears manage to pull the price below it, the next stop could be $21,480.\n\nAPE/USDT\n\nApeCoin (APE) has been range-bound between $7.80 and $3 for the past several months. After the bears failed to sink the price below the range, the bulls are attempting a comeback. They will try to propel the price to the resistance of the range.\n\nAPE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought area suggest that buyers have the upper hand. There is a minor resistance near $6.40 but if buyers bulldoze their way through it, the APE/USDT pair could surge to $7.80. This level may witness aggressive selling by the bears.\n\nThe positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($4.80). That could sink the price to the 50-day simple moving average ($4.17).\n\nAPE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the pair is in a strong uptrend. The bears are trying to stall the up-move at $6 but a positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This indicates that every minor dip is being purchased. The bulls will now try to propel the price above $6 and resume the uptrend.\n\nOn the contrary, the bears will try to pull the price below the 20-EMA. If they succeed, the pair could attract profit-booking from the short-term bulls. The pair could then tumble to $5.\n\nMANA/USDT\n\nDecentraland (MANA) rallied sharply from $0.28 on Dec. 30 to $0.78 on Jan. 21, which shows strong momentum in favor of the bulls.\n\nMANA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears sold the break above $0.74 on Jan. 17 but the bulls stepped in and bought the dip at $0.61. This shows that the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe bulls will have to sustain the price above $0.74 to signal the start of the next leg of the recovery. The MANA/USDT pair could surge to $0.87 and thereafter to the psychological barrier at $1.\n\nIf bears want to gain the upper hand, they will have to sink the price below $0.61. If they do that, the pair could start a deeper correction to $0.53.\n\nMANA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows the formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern. If buyers thrust the price above the neckline of the pattern, the setup will complete and the pair could spurt toward the target objective at $0.93.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that the bears are fiercely guarding the $0.74 resistance. The pair could then plunge to the $0.61 to $0.55 support zone.\n\nRelated: Terra lending protocol Mars to launch mainnet\n\nAAVE/USDT\n\nAave (AAVE) broke and closed above the downtrend line on Jan. 17 signaling a potential trend change. The bears tried to yank the price back below the downtrend line on Jan. 18 but the bulls held their ground.\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($74) and the RSI in the overbought region suggest that bulls have the edge. This advantage could strengthen further with a break above $92. The AAVE/USDT pair could then rally to the psychologically crucial level of $100.\n\nThis level may again pose a strong challenge to buyers but if they overcome this obstacle, the pair could skyrocket toward $115.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and dives below the downtrend line, it will signal that bears are active at higher levels. The advantage may tilt in favor of the bears on a slide below the 20-day EMA.\n\nAAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are defending the zone between $88 and $91 but they haven\u2019t been able to pull the price below the moving averages. This indicates a bullish sentiment where traders are buying the dips.\n\nThe bulls will make one more attempt to clear the overhead zone. If they can pull it off, the pair could resume the uptrend.\n\nInstead, if the bulls fail to push the price above $91, the bears will try to tug the pair below the moving averages. The pair could then fall to $78 and later to $73.\n\nFIL/USDT\n\nFilecoin (FIL) broke above the downtrend line on Jan. 14 and held the retest of the breakout level on Jan. 18. This suggests that the bulls have flipped the downtrend line into support.\n\nFIL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the overbought space, signaling that bulls are in control. The FIL/USDT pair could rally to $6.50 where the bears may again mount a strong defense. If bulls kick the price above this level, the up-move could reach $9 with a brief halt near $7.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($4.24) is the important support to watch out for on the downside because a drop below it could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nFIL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears tried to stall the relief rally at $5 but the bulls pierced this resistance and started the next leg of the recovery. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate that bulls are firmly in the driver\u2019s seat. Buyers will try to nudge the pair toward $6.50 and then $7.\n\nOn the downside, the 20-EMA is the critical support to pay attention to. If the price rebounds off this level, it will indicate that the uptrend remains intact. On the other hand, if bears drag the price below the moving averages, the pair could collapse to $4.20.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Compared to the previous week, last week's total inflows are nearly four times as high.\n\nGermany and Switzerland led inflows in Europe ($14 million and $10 million, respectively), while Hong Kong, on the other hand, saw outflows from long investment products to the tune of $11 million.\n\nAmerican investors were the most skeptical, however, with 95% of inflows in the U.S. moving into short Bitcoin products.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoinShares\u2019 weekly reports cover investment inflows and outflows in popular ETPs, mutual funds, and over-the-counter (OTC) trusts referencing Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other altcoins. Importantly, these are not direct investments into the cryptocurrencies that these products represent.\n\nLast week also saw the trading volume for crypto investment products rise to $1.6 billion, which is above the 90-day average of $990 million, with total assets under management reaching $29 billion\u2014the highest since September last year.\n\nHowever, the devil is in the details, as the narrative is dominated by short-BTC inflows ($25.5 million), almost five times the inflow for long-BTC products, which accounted for a mere $5.7 million.\n\nThis represents the largest weekly inflow in short products since July 2022 ($51 million), the report continues.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSuch a picture is very much in line with the division of opinions within the crypto investor community.\n\nInvestors are split on whether the recent market\u2019s upward trend, which saw Bitcoin briefly surpass $23,000 over the weekend, is just the beginning of a new bull run, or a so-called \u201cbull trap.\u201d"

        "content": "A recent upswing in the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has provoked a distantly familiar debate: whether a market rebound could be imminent or if recent trends are just a prelude to more pain.\n\nSince Bitcoin reached an all-time high of around $69,000 in November of 2021, digital assets have been walloped by higher interest rates and a series of high-profile collapses\u2013firms like Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX, to name a few.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is down nearly 67% from its peak, digital assets\u2013and other investments like stocks\u2013have had a positive start to the year. The price of Bitcoin has risen 38% so far this month to $22,858, its highest price since last August. Ethereum, meanwhile, has seen the value of ETH rise around 38% as well to $1,645, according to CoinGecko.\n\nCryptocurrency prices began rising earlier this month in anticipation of an economic report that showed inflation cooled in December. The reading also lifted hopes about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates less aggressively than they have in the past year to tame soaring prices.\n\n2022 Wasn't All Bad for Crypto (Just Mostly)\n\nBut be weary, say the cautious. Many crypto commentators believe the recent uptick in prices is too good to be true and are labeling the rally a bull trap, predicting the breakout will come crashing down and burn traders who mistook it as the beginning of a new uptrend.\n\nOthers following the rally are also skeptical. A Twitter poll conducted by a popular Bitcoin page reached a consensus among over 18,000 participants that the rally was indeed a bull trap on Jan. 15.\n\nMore recently, \u201cil Capo Of Crypto,\u201d a prominent influencer and self-proclaimed crypto analyst, agreed with the bearish take, saying the rally \u201cclearly looks manipulated\u201d and is the \u201cbiggest bull trap\u201d they\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nI've been checking charts all this time, avoiding noise from Twitter. The way the upward movement is happening, the way htf resistances are being tested... it clearly looks manipulated, no real demand. Once again, the biggest bull trap I've ever seen. But they won't trap me. \u2014 il Capo Of Crypto (@CryptoCapo_) January 21, 2023\n\nThe sentiment among cautious crypto enthusiasts was echoed on Reddit, where one user pushed back against observations supporting a market bottom made in a news article.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cHard to believe that it was only a week or so ago that everyone and their analyst was solemnly and confidently proclaiming that [Bitcoin at] 12k was inevitable and unavoidable,\u201d the user stated.\n\nAnd, of course, there\u2019s Jim Cramer. The host of MSNBC\u2019s Mad Money tweeted Wednesday that the recent bounce is \u201cmanipulation\u201d and further evidence that digital assets are a \u201csham market.\u201d\n\nthe manipulation higher of crypto shows you this is truly a sham market.... \u2014 Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) January 18, 2023\n\nThe mixed accuracy of Cramer\u2019s commentary over the long haul has become the subject of ridicule, prompting many memes and the popularity of accounts like the \u201cInverse Cramer ETF,\u201d a fictional Exchange-Traded Fund that recommends the opposite of Cramer\u2019s advice.\n\nJim Cramer Turns Bearish on Crypto. Is That Bullish?\n\nIn response to Cramer\u2019s assertion on Wednesday, multiple accounts took the host\u2019s pessimism as a positive sign, such as Dan Held, head of growth marketing at crypto exchange Kraken, who replied, \u201cBottom is in!\u201d\n\nBottom is in! \u2014 Dan Held (@danheld) January 19, 2023\n\nOther influential accounts on Twitter were earnestly bullish, such as \u201cPlanB,\u201d who declared a new bull market in digital assets had begun as Bitcoin\u2019s recent pump took hold. Some community members took it as an opportunity to harp on those who believe digital assets will face more losses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a bull trap trust me bro, I\u2019m still waiting for 12k to load up.\u201d pic.twitter.com/tPUbw3vSMm \u2014 Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) January 12, 2023\n\nThe upswing in prices has also left a few on Wall Street scratching their heads.\n\nA research report published Friday by JP Morgan analysts couldn\u2019t explain the surge in crypto prices with confidence, but did acknowledge market conditions for riskier assets have grown more favorable, citing the recent inflation report\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a great answer on the January-to-date rally of crypto, but we do think it is emblematic of the underlying conviction many still have in cryptocurrencies,\u201d it stated. \u201cThe crypto-bulls and whales seem to have been reinvigorated.\u201d"

        "content": "When most people think of crypto companies, they typically think of cryptocurrency mining companies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and financial institutions heavily involved with crypto assets. However, there are a growing number of companies that have extensive exposure to crypto without many people even realizing it.\n\nOne way to find these crypto stocks is by checking out the official holdings of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that specialize in blockchain and crypto. For example, if you take a look at the holdings for the Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF (NYSEMKT: STCE), which launched in 2022, you can see a number of names that seem incongruous at first. Three names particularly stand out: MicroStrategy (MSTR 7.35%), Overstock.com (BYON 0.76%), and AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC -0.46%).\n\n1. MicroStrategy\n\nOn the surface, MicroStrategy looks just like a typical software analytics company. The company provides software solutions to a wide range of financial services, retail, healthcare, and technology companies. But what it is best known for is the extensive amount of Bitcoin (BTC 2.16%) it holds on its balance sheet. As of Dec. 27, MicroStrategy held 132,500 Bitcoins, now worth over $2.7 billion. Given that the total market cap of MicroStrategy is just over $2.5 billion, it is easy to see how buying this company's stock is really just a proxy for buying Bitcoin.\n\nMoreover, the former CEO (and now executive chairman) of the company is none other than Michael Saylor, one of the biggest Bitcoin bulls in the world. On the MicroStrategy website, there's an orange Bitcoin button -- once you press it, you'll be redirected to a new site with a collection of videos from Saylor extolling the virtues of crypto and Bitcoin.\n\nSaylor has publicly predicted that the price of Bitcoin is going to $500,000, and he is positioning MicroStrategy to take advantage of this stratospheric new valuation. Until this year, it primarily meant accumulating more and more Bitcoin for the company. But in 2023, the company also plans to expand the number of software and enterprise infrastructure solutions it can provide related to the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which enables fast, secure, low-cost Bitcoin payments.\n\n2. Overstock.com\n\nIf you thought Overstock was just a discount retailer specializing in furniture and home furnishings, you would be mistaken. When it launched during the dot-com boom, Overstock.com made its name by becoming a high-profile e-commerce website where you could buy just about anything at significantly reduced prices. However, Overstock.com has embarked on a strategic overhaul in recent years that has often emphasized blockchain and crypto.\n\nThe first step occurred in 2014 when Overstock.com became the first major e-commerce site to accept Bitcoin. Then, in 2017, Overstock.com became the first major retailer to accept a wide range of altcoins, including Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE). Moreover, at about the same time, Overstock.com created a wholly owned subsidiary called Medici Ventures, which invests in blockchain and crypto companies. Prior investments have included start-ups that specialize in everything from crypto tokens to digital wallets.\n\n3. AMC Entertainment\n\nFinally, there's AMC Entertainment, which is more than just a movie theater chain these days. Quite simply, the company has realized that the previous generation of entertainment is coming to an end. So what do you do for an encore when people prefer to stream movies at home rather than go to the local cinema?\n\nThe answer, quite simply, is crypto. In 2021, the company announced it would begin accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment for movie tickets. In addition to Bitcoin, AMC Entertainment now accepts Dogecoin and Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) as a form of payment. And the company is also exploring a wide range of other initiatives related to film and cinema, including new NFT collections related to blockbuster films and possibly even a new crypto token tied to its business operations.\n\nHow to value these crypto companies?\n\nBefore you think about investing in these stocks just because they are \"crypto companies,\" just keep in mind how fiendishly hard it can be to value these stocks. In the example of MicroStrategy, nearly all of the company's valuation is tied up with Bitcoin, so it might not seem difficult. But what about Overstock.com and AMC Entertainment, where it is a lot harder to figure out how much of future cash flows are attributable to crypto?\n\nFor now, the only one of these crypto companies currently on my watchlist for 2023 is MicroStrategy, given its price has skyrocketed 74% since the end of December. It will be interesting to see how the company plans to offer new Bitcoin Lightning Network solutions to clients, and whether that can move the needle on Bitcoin's acceptance as an online payment solution.\n\nWhen I'm looking through the holdings of ETFs, that's the type of catalyst I would like to see. The next time you peruse the holdings of an ETF, look for an interesting company doing unexpected things in a hot niche or sector."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA solo Bitcoin miner with an average hashing power of just 10 TH/s (terahashes per second) won the race to add block 772,793 to the Bitcoin blockchain on Friday.\n\nAt the time the block was added, Bitcoin's total hash rate was just over 269 exahash per second, meaning the solo miner's 10 TH/s hash rate represented just 0.000000037% of the blockchain's entire computational power.\n\nPut simply: It was an extremely unlikely win for an individual miner.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCongratulations to miner 1CEmkQkgiCMx6DHSDkHi53mL8oEthCZSw with only 10TH who solved a solo block at https://t.co/UWgBvLkDqc ! https://t.co/0O7A7KR4eu \u2014 Dr. Con Kolivas (@ckpooldev) January 20, 2023\n\nDespite the odds stacked against them, the solo miner was the first to produce a valid hash for the block to be mined. In return, the miner received 98% of the total 6.35939231 BTC allotted for the block reward and fees. The remaining 2% went to Solo CK Pool, an online mining service that facilitates individual mining.\n\nBitcoin's randomness and probabilities coded for luck and work\n\nTo add a block to a proof-of-work blockchain like Bitcoin, the miner must be the first to calculate a valid hash for the block, which can only be discovered using brute computational force.\n\nMining machines run an encryption algorithm to produce a hash that falls below a threshold specified by the network. If the algorithm produces a value that is above the hash target, the miner tries the algorithm again with a slightly altered input to produce a completely new value for the hash. Miners built specifically to perform this function are able to compute trillions of unique hashes each second.\n\nHowever, even if a miner's machine were able to only produce one hash per second, it is theoretically possible that the algorithm's first output could be a valid hash to solve the block.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat were the odds?\n\nThe chances of adding a block as a solo miner are determined by the number of hashes the miner's rig is computing per second in relation to the total number of hashes that all of the machines on the network are computing each second.\n\nAccording to a post from user Willi9974 on the BitcoinTalk forum less than an hour after block 772,793 was solved, the lucky solo miner had an average hash rate over the previous hour of 10.6 TH/s.\n\nThe information posted on BitcoinTalk also revealed that the ~10 TH/s was the combined power of four machines (called \"workers\"). This suggests that this solo miner's rig was likely made up of four USB stick Bitcoin miners, which can individually achieve a hash rate of around 3 TH/s and cost roughly $200 each.\n\nUsing the difficulty level included in block 772,793 and assuming the solo miner's rig was computing 10 TH/s, it is possible to calculate the total estimated hash rate as 269,082,950 TH/s at the time the block was solved.\n\nBased on this, the odds of this solo miner being the first to solve the block with a valid hash are one in 26.9 million. Statistically, that means that if the same circumstances were repeated infinite times, the solo miner would add the block 0.000000037% of the time, on average.\n\nUnlikely, but not impossible\u2014and this has happened before\n\nWhile this scenario was extremely unlikely, similar \"once-in-a-lifetime\" events in Bitcoin mining have happened before.\n\nOne year ago, in less than two weeks, there were three different solo miners that solved blocks with improbable hash rates\u2014the third's hash rate was apparently just 8.3 TH/s in comparison to the estimated 190,719,350 TH/s total hash rate, which comes out to a one in 23 million chance (or 0.000000044%).\n\nA hash is either valid and thus solves the block, or it isn't. There is no strategy involved, as the entire system is based on the random generation of hash values and the response mechanisms of the network to maintain core probabilities. Bitcoin runs on code and formulas, so a solo miner somehow solving the next four blocks is perfectly possible within Bitcoin\u2019s mathematical system.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMining pools remain the usual winners\n\nAnecdotes about solo miners like these could end up introducing a new hobby to the ever-hopeful. However, the vast majority of blocks added to the Bitcoin blockchain today have been produced by large pools of mining rigs that combine their hashing power and share earnings.\n\nIn doing so, each miner's contribution is rewarded proportionally each time the pool mines a block.\n\nAccording to blockchain explorer and mining pool BTC.com, the largest Bitcoin mining pool is currently Foundry USA, with its collective 90.19 EH/s computing power making up 31.3% of the network's total hash rate\u2014which means they earn a share of the block rewards and fees for one in every three blocks, on average.\n\nMining pools date back to 2010 and have steadily captured greater shares of hash rate distribution year over year as mining difficulty increased and mining technology improved. Today, at least 98% of Bitcoin miners online belong to a mining pool."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA recent upswing in the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has provoked a distantly familiar debate: whether a market rebound could be imminent or if recent trends are just a prelude to more pain.\n\nSince Bitcoin reached an all-time high of around $69,000 in November of 2021, digital assets have been walloped by higher interest rates and a series of high-profile collapses\u2013firms like Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX, to name a few.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is down nearly 67% from its peak, digital assets\u2013and other investments like stocks\u2013have had a positive start to the year. The price of Bitcoin has risen 38% so far this month to $22,858, its highest price since last August. Ethereum, meanwhile, has seen the value of ETH rise around 38% as well to $1,645, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCryptocurrency prices began rising earlier this month in anticipation of an economic report that showed inflation cooled in December. The reading also lifted hopes about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates less aggressively than they have in the past year to tame soaring prices.\n\nBut be weary, say the cautious. Many crypto commentators believe the recent uptick in prices is too good to be true and are labeling the rally a bull trap, predicting the breakout will come crashing down and burn traders who mistook it as the beginning of a new uptrend.\n\nOthers following the rally are also skeptical. A Twitter poll conducted by a popular Bitcoin page reached a consensus among over 18,000 participants that the rally was indeed a bull trap on Jan. 15.\n\nMore recently, \u201cil Capo Of Crypto,\u201d a prominent influencer and self-proclaimed crypto analyst, agreed with the bearish take, saying the rally \u201cclearly looks manipulated\u201d and is the \u201cbiggest bull trap\u201d they\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nI've been checking charts all this time, avoiding noise from Twitter. The way the upward movement is happening, the way htf resistances are being tested... it clearly looks manipulated, no real demand. Once again, the biggest bull trap I've ever seen. But they won't trap me. \u2014 il Capo Of Crypto (@CryptoCapo_) January 21, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe sentiment among cautious crypto enthusiasts was echoed on Reddit, where one user pushed back against observations supporting a market bottom made in a news article.\n\n\u201cHard to believe that it was only a week or so ago that everyone and their analyst was solemnly and confidently proclaiming that [Bitcoin at] 12k was inevitable and unavoidable,\u201d the user stated.\n\nAnd, of course, there\u2019s Jim Cramer. The host of MSNBC\u2019s Mad Money tweeted Wednesday that the recent bounce is \u201cmanipulation\u201d and further evidence that digital assets are a \u201csham market.\u201d\n\nthe manipulation higher of crypto shows you this is truly a sham market.... \u2014 Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) January 18, 2023\n\nThe mixed accuracy of Cramer\u2019s commentary over the long haul has become the subject of ridicule, prompting many memes and the popularity of accounts like the \u201cInverse Cramer ETF,\u201d a fictional Exchange-Traded Fund that recommends the opposite of Cramer\u2019s advice.\n\nIn response to Cramer\u2019s assertion on Wednesday, multiple accounts took the host\u2019s pessimism as a positive sign, such as Dan Held, head of growth marketing at crypto exchange Kraken, who replied, \u201cBottom is in!\u201d\n\nBottom is in! \u2014 Dan Held (@danheld) January 19, 2023\n\nOther influential accounts on Twitter were earnestly bullish, such as \u201cPlanB,\u201d who declared a new bull market in digital assets had begun as Bitcoin\u2019s recent pump took hold. Some community members took it as an opportunity to harp on those who believe digital assets will face more losses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a bull trap trust me bro, I\u2019m still waiting for 12k to load up.\u201d pic.twitter.com/tPUbw3vSMm \u2014 Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) January 12, 2023\n\nThe upswing in prices has also left a few on Wall Street scratching their heads.\n\nA research report published Friday by JP Morgan analysts couldn\u2019t explain the surge in crypto prices with confidence, but did acknowledge market conditions for riskier assets have grown more favorable, citing the recent inflation report\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a great answer on the January-to-date rally of crypto, but we do think it is emblematic of the underlying conviction many still have in cryptocurrencies,\u201d it stated. \u201cThe crypto-bulls and whales seem to have been reinvigorated.\u201d"

        "content": "As of January 2023, it's been 14 years since the cryptocurrency industry came into existence. Over the last decade and a half, almost, the industry has been through a lot. It has seen the launch of over 22,000 different altcoins. It has had a year-long bull market and two year-long bear markets, popularly called crypto winters. The blockchain \u2014 the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies \u2014 has seen the launch of numerous products.\n\nBut, even after all these years, the crypto industry still sees only one altcoin as a real competitor to Bitcoin. That is, of course, Litecoin \u2014 silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold. In this guide, we will compare the two and see what it is that makes them similar as well as different. If you are new to the crypto industry, this Litecoin vs. Bitcoin article might give you some new insight. Also, it might even help you decide which of them you like more.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nBitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was described in a 2008 document published on October 31 by an individual or group known only as Satoshi Nakamoto. Despite over a decade and a half passing, the identity of Nakamoto remains unknown. The document explains that Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency run by the members of the community.\n\nNo government, bank, or single entity would have any power over it or the network on which it runs. Instead, it would be a peer-to-peer online currency, with an explanation of how it would be implemented. Nakamoto also explained that its underlying technology would be a decentralized ledger of transactions packed into batches or blocks. All of it would use cryptographic algorithms for security, which is how blockchain came to be.\n\nIt would also have a fixed supply of 21 million coins, which would be released in small quantities. Whenever a block is \u201csolved\u201d through computing power that processes transactions, a small portion of BTC gets released. Initially, it was 50 BTC, with plans to cut this amount in half whenever 210,000 blocks get solved. This is called the halving, and it happens after every four years, roughly.\n\nNakamoto made the first Bitcoin transaction on January 3, 2009, thus solving its Genesis block. This launched the first 50 BTC into circulation, and the process has never stopped since.\n\nEssentially worthless at first, Bitcoin\u2019s real value was in the idea that created it. This idea of digital money that no government could control attracted tech geeks but also online criminals. But, it also gave BTC its first price, moving it from $0 for the first time due to simple demand.\n\nTo this day, Bitcoin has grown a lot, once even reaching the value of $69,000 per coin. But it all started with Nakamoto. After receiving its value, Bitcoin quickly attracted a group of developers who started working on it. Meanwhile, Satoshi Nakamoto withdraws into the shadows after a few years of spreading the word about his creation. As years went by, new cryptos started to launch, inspired by Bitcoin. Each of them believed it could either do better or bring something new to the growing crypto industry.\n\nAbout two years after Bitcoin\u2019s launch, its largest competitor emerged \u2014 a coin known as Litecoin (LTC).\n\nWhat is Litecoin (LTC)?\n\nLike Bitcoin, Litecoin also emerged as a decentralized digital asset. It also relied on the decentralized community that would supply it with computing power to maintain security and validity. However, Litecoin was one of the projects that wanted to improve Bitcoin\u2019s technology.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s idea was revolutionizing, its technology was (and still is) very flawed. Bitcoin can only process one block per 10 minutes, and each block can only store a handful of transactions. This makes it very slow, and it is unfit to satisfy global demand. So, one developer \u2014 Charlie Lee \u2014 came up with the idea of creating a similar but better asset.\n\nThis is how Litecoin came to be. One of many forks of Bitcoin, Litecoin is named like this because it is the \u201clite version of Bitcoin.\u201d It is four times faster than the original, thanks to this fact, and more accessible. It never saw the massive transaction fees that Bitcoin has, either. However, it does share a lot of Bitcoin\u2019s characteristics and features.\n\nSome of them include decentralization and the use of the same Proof of Work algorithm. However, Litecoin uses a different hashing function called Scrypt. Its coin supply sits at 84 million cryptocurrencies, and its transaction time is 2.5 minutes.\n\nLitecoin also uses halving; only it happens after every 840,000 blocks. Litecoin\u2019s network is four times faster. Meanwhile, the number of blocks needed for the halving is four times larger. This means that the halving still happens roughly every four years. At the same time, the total supply is four times larger than Bitcoin\u2019s, as well.\n\nAll of this means that Litecoin is a lighter, more efficient version of Bitcoin.\n\nThe similarities between Bitcoin and Litecoin\n\nBitcoin and Litecoin share a number of similarities, some of which we already mentioned. They are both decentralized, they rely on Proof of Work, and they operate as utility coins, meaning digital money. They rely on the community to supply them with the computing power needed for confirmation transactions.\n\nThey both conduct the halving process after a specific number of blocks, releasing coins in return. Like Bitcoin, Litecoin also started by granting its community 50 LTC per block until the halving had started.\n\nHowever, the two share a number of differences, and these differences are far more impactful than their similarities.\n\nThe differences between Bitcoin and Litecoin\n\nLitecoin, silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold, was created by Charlie Lee, rather than an anonymous individual or group. Lee is a well-known and respected member of the crypto industry who publicly supports his project.\n\nAnother difference between Litecoin and Bitcoin lies in their transaction speed. Bitcoin can process 5 to 7 transactions per second, requiring 10 minutes to form a block. Meanwhile, each block can only store 1MB of data. This makes it incredibly slow. At the same time, Litecoin can process 54 transactions per second. It needs around 2.5 minutes to create a block, and it is four times faster than BTC.\n\nIt uses its own cryptocurrency, LTC, which has a significantly smaller market capitalization. Even now, after a year of price drops, BTC has a market cap of $407.4 billion. Meanwhile, Litecoin only has $6.1 billion. Their technology also differs slightly, as Bitcoin uses a SHA-256 mining algorithm, while Litecoin uses Scrypt.\n\nBitcoin vs. Litecoin on charts\n\nLooking at the charts of the two assets, we can also see differences in their price performance over the years.\n\nBitcoin, for example, showed several major price surges. The one in late 2017 is now a minor blip, although, at the time, it was a massive development. It was, however, completely overshadowed by two surges in 2021.\n\nLitecoin, on the other hand, barely exceeded its 2017 high during the 2021 bull runs. It managed to do it only once, while the second 2021 price surge did not even reach the 2017 level.\n\nThe reason for this is simply the fact that Bitcoin is more popular. Despite having worse technological capabilities, it is the first crypto. Its brand, size, potential use cases, level of adoption, and more, guarantee its success. Litecoin is well-adopted by many online websites in its own right, and it is far from being an unsuccessful coin. However, for the time being, its technological improvements were not enough to beat Bitcoin\u2019s brand.\n\nBitcoin vs. Litecoin: which is better?\n\nIn the end, deciding which of the two is better is a personal choice. Technologically speaking, Litecoin is four times Bitcoin\u2019s superior. However, when it comes to popularity, use cases, brand size, and other aspects, there is no comparison. Bitcoin wins every time if we use these parameters to compare the two. Essentially, it all comes down to what you prefer \u2014 the security of Bitcoin\u2019s brand or the benefits of Litecoin\u2019s network.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs Litecoin better than Bitcoin?\n\nTechnologically speaking, yes. Litecoin has more advanced technology that makes it four times faster. However, Litecoin is a smaller, less popular altcoin, while Bitcoin dominates the crypto industry.\n\nWill Litecoin overtake Bitcoin?\n\nCurrently, it appears unlikely that Litecoin will surpass Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a two-year head start in building its brand. Despite its imperfections, it holds significant value as the first cryptocurrency.\n\nWho created Litecoin?\n\nLitecoin was created by a developer called Charlie Lee. Lee developed it two years after the launch of Bitcoin. Before launching Litecoin, Lee was a Google engineer.\n\nWho created Bitcoin?\n\nThe truth is that nobody knows the identity of Bitcoin\u2019s creator. They could be a person or an entire team. All that is known is their alias, Satoshi Nakamoto."

        "content": "DUNDEE, Michigan (WTVG) - Internet scams can happen anywhere, even in a small town.\n\nPolice in Dundee, MI, say a 71-year-old man recently fell victim to a con that\u2019s making the rounds in our area. It started with a pop-up on the internet claiming to be from the man\u2019s bank. The message gave him a number to call.\n\nThe scammer then told the man his bank account was hacked, and that he needed to transfer out his money and convert it to Bitcoin to keep it safe.\n\n\u201cSo, he was asked to get out $15,000 two days in a row to basically empty out his savings account. He followed directions to go to a bitcoin machine in Dearborn, MI, where he deposited money over two days, and he was even warned by the scammer, \u2018If the bank asks you what you\u2019re doing, tell them you\u2019re making some home repairs.\u2019 Because they\u2019re telling him that a bank employee is actually involved with the hacking of his information,\u201d explained Acting Dundee Police Chief Lieutenant Randy Sehl.\n\nLt. Sehl said once that money was deposited in the foreign account, it was converted into digital currency. That made the cash in the machine obsolete and off-limits.\n\n\u201cWe asked why we couldn\u2019t get the money out of the machine. Actually, that\u2019s just an avenue for the money to go across seas. It\u2019s all electronically transferred once it\u2019s put in there. It\u2019s not really the machine or the owner of the machine\u2019s responsibility for that because the crime had already happened. So, we\u2019re working all avenues to try to get the money back, but it\u2019s not looking good right now,\u201d said Lt. Sehl.\n\nDundee Police are working with Homeland Security and the F.B.I. on the case. Meantime, they\u2019re spreading the word so no one else falls victim.\n\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has recently initiated an upward trend, breaking above key resistance levels and moving averages. In November 2022, BTC found support at the $16,000 level, and on January 12th and 13th, it has since surpassed the 100-day and 200-day moving averages at $18,000 and $19,600, respectively.\n\nThis is a significant bullish sign for the market as it suggests that adequate demand will likely return. However, there is also a bearish divergence between the price and the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily timeframe.\n\nThis particular technical pattern suggests that a correction will likely occur soon, which can guide traders in charting their next move. To stay responsive to chart movements, traders often use pivot points to evaluate probabilities and make quick decisions."

If you are looking for a short-term investment, then you are better off investing now, in order to take advantage of the increase in value of Bitcoin.\n\n5 reasons why Bitcoin is a high-potential cryptocurrency in 2023\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is the largest and oldest crypto asset, which makes it exceptionally trusted and well-known.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin has a limited supply (maximum of 21 million coins), which makes it valuable and rare.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is highly liquid and can be exchanged for all major fiat and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is regularly updated and improved by the open source community, making it a safe long-term investment.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin is decentralized, which means it is not controlled by a central authority and is therefore immune to political manipulation.\n\nBitcoin is one of the most promising and high potential cryptocurrencies for the year 2023. There are many reasons why Bitcoin is a crypto-currency with high potential. First of all, Bitcoin is one of the most popular and widely used crypto-currencies, which makes it a great choice for investors.

Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that the cryptocurrency market is very volatile, and prices can fluctuate significantly from day to day.\n\nWhy buy CFD bitcoin?\n\nCFDs, or Contracts for Difference, allow traders to speculate on the price of an asset, such as bitcoin, without actually owning the underlying asset. This can be beneficial for several reasons, such as the ability to go short and profit from bitcoin price decrease, or the ability to trade with leverage, which can amplify potential profits. However, it's important to note that CFDs also amplify potential losses and can be a high-risk investment.\n\nChoose Blackbull to buy bitcoin\n\nBlackbull is a trading platform that allows individuals to buy and sell various assets, including bitcoin.

        "title": "What Is Bitcoin Dominance Chart? - OKX",
        "content": "The bitcoin dominance chart is a widely used metric in the cryptocurrency market. It can provide valuable insights into the relative performance of bitcoin compared to other digital assets and help identify trends and patterns in the market. As a result, many investors and traders use this chart to make informed decisions about the cryptocurrency market. But what exactly does the [bitcoin dominance chart](/learn/understanding-bitcoin-dominance-a-comprehensive-guide) measure, and what are its implications for the crypto market?\n\nThis blog will explore the history, how it is measured, factors affecting the bitcoin dominance chart, and its role in understanding the crypto market.\n\nWhat Is The Bitcoin Dominance Chart/Index?\n\nBitcoin Dominance Chart (also known as [Bitcoin Dominance Index](/learn/understanding-bitcoin-dominance-a-comprehensive-guide)) is a metric that measures the percentage of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies that Bitcoin holds. In other words, it shows how much of the total value of all digital currencies is attributed to Bitcoin. This metric is often used to gauge the overall strength and influence of the Bitcoin market compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart is calculated by taking the market capitalization of Bitcoin and dividing it by the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the price of a single unit of a cryptocurrency by the total number of units in circulation. This metric is updated in real-time and is widely used to track the relative performance of Bitcoin compared to other digital assets.\n\nThe metric is also used to identify trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market. When the Bitcoin Dominance Chart is high, it indicates that Bitcoin is dominating the market and other cryptocurrencies are not performing as well. When the chart is low, it suggests that other cryptocurrencies are gaining market share and potentially overtaking Bitcoin in terms of overall value.\n\nIt is important to note that the Bitcoin Dominance Chart is not a measure of the actual value of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies but rather a measure of the relative market share. It can also be used to get a sense of the overall health of the cryptocurrency market. A high Bitcoin Dominance ratio can indicate a strong and stable market, while a low chart can indicate a more volatile and uncertain market.\n\nHistory of the Bitcoin Dominance Chart\n\nThe history of the Bitcoin Dominance Chart can be traced back to the early days of the cryptocurrency market when Bitcoin (BTC) was the only major player. According to a Medium post by Jimmy Song, the Bitcoin Dominance Index was originally created to illustrate how importance Bitcoin had in the overall crypto economy. At the time, Bitcoin accounted for nearly 100% of the cryptocurrency market capitalization, so the metric was an important way to measure the relative importance of the first digital currency to scale.\n\nHowever, as the crypto market evolved and more and more alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) emerged, the Bitcoin Dominance Chart became less relevant as a measure of the overall market. The crypto bull market of 2020 and 2021 saw the rise of new projects and protocols, which increased the market capitalization of other digital assets, diluting the dominance of Bitcoin and making the metric less meaningful.\n\nDespite this, the Bitcoin Dominance Chart remains an important tool for investors and traders as it can provide valuable insights into the relative performance of Bitcoin (BTC) compared to other digital assets. It can also be used to identify trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market, which can be useful for making predictions about future price movements. While the metric may not be as relevant as it once was, it still plays a role in understanding the overall health of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHow Is Bitcoin Dominance Measured?\n\nBitcoin dominance is a measure of the market share of Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies. It is calculated by taking the market capitalization of Bitcoin and dividing it by the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the price of a single unit of a cryptocurrency by the total number of units in circulation.\n\nFor example, if the market capitalization of Bitcoin is $200 billion and the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is $300 billion, then Bitcoin dominance is 66.67% ($200 billion / $300 billion). This means that 66.67% of the total value of all digital currencies is attributed to Bitcoin.\n\nThe market capitalization of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is typically obtained from cryptocurrency exchanges, which provide real-time data on the price and trading volume of various digital assets. These data are then used to calculate the market capitalization of each cryptocurrency. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is obtained by summing the market capitalization of each cryptocurrency.\n\nIt is important to note that the Bitcoin Dominance Chart is not a measure of the actual value of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies but rather a measure of the relative market share. It can be used to get a sense of the overall health of the cryptocurrency market. A high Bitcoin Dominance ratio can indicate a strong and stable market, while a low chart can indicate a more volatile and uncertain market.\n\nInvestors and traders widely use the Bitcoin Dominance Chart to understand the relative performance of Bitcoin compared to other digital assets and also to identify trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market. However, use this metric with other indicators to get a more complete picture of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFactors Influencing Bitcoin Dominance\n\nSeveral factors can influence the Bitcoin Dominance Chart and the market share of Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies. Some of the main factors include:\n\nMarket Sentiment\n\nMarket sentiment refers to the overall attitude of investors towards a particular asset or market. If market sentiment towards Bitcoin is positive, it can drive up the price and market capitalization of Bitcoin, which will increase its dominance. On the other hand, if market sentiment toward Bitcoin is negative, it can drive down the price and market capitalization of Bitcoin, which will decrease its dominance.\n\nInnovations and Developments in Other Cryptocurrencies\n\nInnovations and developments in other cryptocurrencies can also influence the Bitcoin Dominance Chart. For example, if a new cryptocurrency is launched that offers a unique value proposition or solves a problem that Bitcoin does not, it can attract investment and drive up its market capitalization, which will decrease Bitcoin's dominance.\n\nRegulations\n\nGovernment regulations can also have a significant impact on the Bitcoin Dominance Chart. For example, if a government announces a crackdown on cryptocurrency trading or mining, it can lead to a decrease in the price and market capitalization of Bitcoin and an increase in the dominance of other cryptocurrencies.\n\nMedia coverage\n\nMedia coverage can also play a role in influencing the Bitcoin Dominance Chart. Negative or positive news coverage can affect the market sentiment towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which can drive the prices up or down and alter the dominance.\n\nCompetition Between Cryptocurrencies\n\nAs the number of cryptocurrencies increase, competition for market share also increases. This can lead to fluctuations in the dominance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Bitcoin Dominance Chart is not a measure of the actual value of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies but rather a measure of the relative market share. It can also be used to get a sense of the overall health of the cryptocurrency market. A high Bitcoin Dominance Chart can indicate a strong and stable market, while a low chart can indicate a more volatile and uncertain market.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Chart: Uses\n\nSome of the main uses of the Bitcoin Dominance Chart include:\n\nUnderstanding Relative Performance\n\nComparing Bitcoin's performance to other digital assets, the Bitcoin Dominance Chart offers a valuable perspective. By tracking the market share of Bitcoin, it allows identifying patterns and trends within the cryptocurrency market. This information can be utilized for forecasting the future direction of the market and making educated investment decisions.\n\nIdentifying Market Trends\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart can also be used to identify trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market. When the chart is high, it indicates that Bitcoin dominates the market and other cryptocurrencies are not performing as well. When the chart is low, it suggests that other cryptocurrencies are gaining market share and potentially overtaking Bitcoin in terms of overall value.\n\nIdentifying Entry and Exit Points\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart can also be used to identify entry and exit points in the cryptocurrency market. For example, when the chart is high, it may indicate a good time to sell Bitcoin and invest in other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, when the chart is low, it may indicate a good time to buy Bitcoin and reduce exposure to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAssessing Overall Market Health\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart can also be used to assess the cryptocurrency market's overall health. A high Bitcoin Dominance Chart can indicate a strong and stable market, while a low chart can indicate a more volatile and uncertain market.\n\nIt's important to note that the Bitcoin Dominance Chart should be used with other indicators to get a more complete picture of the cryptocurrency market. However, when used correctly, it can be a valuable tool for making informed decisions about the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Chart Disadvantages\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart is a widely used metric in the cryptocurrency market, but it also has certain disadvantages that should be considered. Some of the main disadvantages of the Bitcoin Dominance Chart include the following:\n\nIncreased Supply\n\nThe increase in the number of cryptocurrencies in the market dilutes the dominance of Bitcoin and can make the metric less relevant. In addition, as more and more alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) emerge, the Bitcoin Dominance Chart becomes less meaningful as a measure of the overall market.\n\nMarket Cap Shortcomings\n\nThe market capitalization used to calculate the Bitcoin Dominance Chart has certain shortcomings. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the price of a single unit of a cryptocurrency by the total number of units in circulation. However, this method does not consider other factors, such as the underlying technology, network effects, and adoption. This means that the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency does not necessarily reflect its true value.\n\nNot Measuring the Actual Value\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart is not a measure of the actual value of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies but rather a measure of the relative market share. It can also be used to get a sense of the overall health of the cryptocurrency market. However, it is important to note that this metric should be used in conjunction with other indicators to get a more complete picture of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin Dominance vs. Ethereum Dominance\n\nBitcoin Dominance and Ethereum Dominance are two metrics used to measure the respective cryptocurrencies' market share of the respective cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, compared to other digital assets. Both metrics are calculated by taking the market capitalization of the respective cryptocurrency and dividing it by the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin Dominance measures the percentage of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies that Bitcoin holds. It is often used to gauge the overall strength and influence of the Bitcoin market compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nEthereum Dominance, on the other hand, measures the percentage of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies that Ethereum holds. It is often used as a gauge of the overall strength and influence of the Ethereum market compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBoth metrics can be used to identify trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market, which can be useful for making predictions about future price movements. However, it's important to note that these metrics are not a measure of the actual value of the respective cryptocurrencies but rather a measure of their relative market share.\n\nIt's also important to note that the market share can fluctuate over time. For example, Bitcoin's dominance has been declining in recent years as more and more altcoins emerge and gain market share, while Ethereum's dominance has been increasing as it's being adopted as the main blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi) and other use cases.\n\nIt's crucial to consider both Bitcoin Dominance and Ethereum Dominance to comprehensively understand the cryptocurrency market and make informed decisions about investments.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Chart: A Reliable Indicator?\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart is a widely used metric in the cryptocurrency market. It is often used as a reliable indicator of Bitcoin's market share compared to other digital assets. However, it's important to consider that while the metric can provide valuable insights into the relative performance of Bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies, it has certain limitations that should be taken into account.\n\nOne of the main limitations of the Bitcoin Dominance Chart is that it is based on market capitalization, which can be a flawed measure of the actual value of a cryptocurrency. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the price of a single unit of a cryptocurrency by the total number of units in circulation. However, this method does not take into account other factors, such as the underlying technology, network effects, and adoption. This means that the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency does not necessarily reflect its true value.\n\nAdditionally, the increase in the number of cryptocurrencies in the market dilutes the dominance of Bitcoin and can make the metric less relevant. As more and more alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) emerge, the Bitcoin Dominance Chart becomes less meaningful as a measure of the overall market.\n\nOverall, while the Bitcoin Dominance Chart can provide valuable insights into the relative performance of Bitcoin compared to other digital assets, it should be used with caution and in conjunction with other indicators to get a more complete picture of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nUse Bitcoin Dominance Chart With Other Indicators\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Chart (also known as Bitcoin Dominance Index) is a widely used metric in the cryptocurrency market that measures the percentage of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies that is held by Bitcoin. The metric can provide valuable insights into the relative performance of Bitcoin compared to other digital assets and can help identify trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the Bitcoin Dominance Chart has certain limitations, such as being based on market capitalization, which is a flawed measure of the actual value of a cryptocurrency, and not taking into account other factors such as user adoption, network effects, or technological advancements. Therefore, it's crucial to consider this metric in conjunction with other indicators to get a more complete picture of the cryptocurrency market. Nevertheless, understanding the Bitcoin Dominance Chart can be useful for making informed decisions about the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin Dominance Index?\n\nBitcoin Dominance Index (BDI) is a metric that measures the percentage of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies that is held by Bitcoin. It is calculated by taking the market capitalization of Bitcoin and dividing it by the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. BDI is used to gauge the overall strength and influence of the Bitcoin market compared to other cryptocurrencies. It can also be used to identify trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market, helping to make predictions about future price movements.\n\nWho Created Bitcoin Dominance Index?\n\nThe origin of the Bitcoin Dominance Index (BDI) is not widely agreed upon, but it is believed to have been created by various individuals or groups who wanted to measure the importance of Bitcoin in the overall crypto economy.\n\nAccording to a Medium post written by Jimmy Song (a self-described Bitcoin educator, developer, and entrepreneur), the BDI was originally created by him to illustrate how much importance Bitcoin had in the overall crypto economy. However, it's worth noting that the BDI is not a proprietary index and can be calculated by anyone with access to the market capitalization data of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat Happens When BTC Dominance Is Low?\n\nWhen the BTC Dominance is low, it means that other cryptocurrencies are gaining market share and potentially overtaking Bitcoin in terms of overall value. This can indicate a trend where investors are moving away from Bitcoin and into other digital assets. It can also suggest that the market sentiment towards Bitcoin is negative, and investors are more bullish on other cryptocurrencies. Low BDI can also indicate that new projects and protocols are gaining popularity among investors, which leads to an increase in the market capitalization of other digital assets, diluting the dominance of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat if Bitcoin Dominance Goes Up?\n\nWhen BTC Dominance goes up, it means that Bitcoin is gaining market share and has a larger percentage of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. This can indicate a trend where investors are moving back to Bitcoin and away from other digital assets. It can also suggest that the market sentiment toward Bitcoin is positive and that investors are more bullish on Bitcoin. High BDI can also indicate that Bitcoin is considered a safe-haven asset, and investors are moving their funds to it during market downturns."

        "content": "When we're talking about the value of any cryptocurrency, we have to take into account the idea that we're dealing with largely unregulated market action. Anyone can pretty much say anything they want about Bitcoin in any sort of public forum, and no government will have the authority to tell them to stop. For example, a tweet shared by CryptoWhale this week suggested that he'd give $1,000 to anyone who retweeted his message if Bitcoin's value did not hit $10,000 by the end of 2022. This is the sort of thing that could be the basis of a legal investigation if it were tied to a regulated stock.\n\nOf course, this sort of public influence has been the subject of some major legal action in the recent past. Elon Musk's tweets about Tesla were the subject of some SEC scrutiny in 2019, and in 2022 his purchase agreement with Twitter has already landed him in trouble since the agreement said he's not to \"disparage the Company or any of its Representatives\" in his tweets about the deal. Neither Bitcoin nor any other cryptocurrency has such protection.\n\nElon Musk or any other major influencer can tweet about Bitcoin all day long, regardless of how much they have invested in the coin at any given time. If Elon Musk says something on Twitter about Tesla, Tesla's value on the stock market could fall, and Musk's associations with Dogecoin could make the value of the dog-themed coin fall. If Elon Musk announces that Tesla is no longer accepting Bitcoin payments, the entire cryptocurrency market falls."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency prices have surged this month, prompting Vietnamese to install mining rigs although it\u2019s not yet a lucrative trade.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin increased from $18,000 to $21,000 on January 14 and has moved sideways since then. The prices of many other cryptocurrencies, including ETC, Aleo, Kat and ERG have also risen this month.\n\nThien Binh, a seller of cryptocurrency mining rigs in Vietnam, said that people had been buying a lot of second-hand Asic brand rigs to mine Doge over the past week.\n\nOn average, an old Asic Baikal G28 model costs VND13 million ($550.8), one-third the cost of a new machine. If the current Doge price of $0.08 remains unchanged for months, miners will break even after 9-10 months.\n\nA veteran miner said: \"We are buying more rigs because mining is still easy now. If the Bitcoin price maintains its current level ($21,000), we will eventually make profits.\"\n\nBinh Minh, who owns many rigs in the southern province of Dong Nai, said some people have heavily invested in installing big networks of rigs to mine ETC and Bitcoin.\n\nSome miners are depositing their rigs at solar farms to cut down electricity costs and increase profits. Most miners use grid electricity.\n\nAccording to Hoang Quan, the administrator of a cryptocurrency mining community with nearly 70,000 members, mining is not lucrative at the moment, thanks to the current price of electricity and cryptocurrencies. But he said the recent increase in cryptocurrency prices is still good news ahead of the Tet holiday (Lunar New Year), which falls in late January.\n\nSome experienced miners said that although the Bitcoin price is rising, the cryptocurrency market is inherently unpredictable, and miners may face more difficulties in the coming time.\n\nVietnam had the second highest rate of cryptocurrency use among 74 economies surveyed in 2021, according to market data provider Statista.\n\nHowever, cryptocurrency has not been recognized as legitimate currency in Vietnam. Its central bank has warned that owning, trading and using cryptocurrency is risky and comes with no legal protection."

        "content": "Nigerian investors who purchased Bitcoin during the November slump are posting enormous gains in the online cryptocurrency market.\n\nData indicates that since its November lows, bitcoin has increased by at least $7,000 (p2p rate N5 million naira).\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, Bitcoin along with major market leaders Ethereum and Solana, surged to levels not seen since August 2022, giving this week\u2019s cryptocurrency market recovery another shock.\n\nThe bulls\u2019 struggle, which lasted for a few days, appears to be over, at least temporarily, as BTC had one of its most remarkable overnight price increases in recent memory. It increased it from under $21,000 to more than $23.2K.\n\nNigerians\u2019 adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets as shown by KuCoin, a well-known crypto exchange, titled \u201cInto the Cryptoverse shows Nigeria stands up among the world; 35% of its citizens, or 33.4 million people, aged 18 to 60, either owned or traded bitcoin or another cryptocurrency in the previous six months.\n\nAccording to Google Trends, Nigeria had the most searches for bitcoin in the first few months of 2021, the report adds.\n\nNigerians are only behind the United States in Bitcoin trade volume from January to August of last year, and at that time, they were more likely to google \u201cBitcoin\u201d than people from any other nation.\n\nProducer price index (PPI) data this week showed a larger-than-anticipated fall, indicating the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary hawkishness has been curbing inflation and boosting investors.\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, traders presently predict that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will increase rates by merely 25 basis points (or 0.25 percentage points) at its February meeting, a slowdown from the 50 basis-point increases in the meeting in December.\n\nWill the rally last? It appears that the current rally will last for longer than just a few weeks as a number of significant Crypto trading trends are pointing upward for the first time in many weeks.\n\nDue to its effortless breakthrough of the $1,500 price level, Ethereum has experienced weekly gains of more than 8%.\n\nDespite the Wednesday dip that took place in expectation of a significant announcement from U.S. federal prosecutors that many believed would target a key participant in the sector, Bitcoin and Ethereum have performed well.\n\nWith Saturday\u2019s unexpected increase, Bitcoin\u2019s seven-day gains now stand at 9%, with a 30% increase over the past 30 days. Bitcoin\u2019s price has dropped by 65% from its record high of over $69K in November 2021, but recent advances indicate that the cryptocurrency market is recovering after a difficult 2022.\n\nHowever, short sellers betting against the cryptocurrency market are facing difficulties and significant losses because, for the past 24 hours, 79,899 traders were liquidated, totaling $369.95 million.\n\nThe greatest single liquidation order, worth $4.53 million, was made on Bitmex."

        "title": "America's first nuclear-powered Bitcoin mining center to open in Pennsylvania - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "With the expansion of the cryptocurrency sector, mining Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming increasingly mainstream, and the construction of the first nuclear-powered data center in the United States that is expected to host Bitcoin mining services has recently been completed.\n\nIndeed, a zero-carbon data center manufacturer Cumulus Data, a subsidiary of an independent power producer Talen Energy, has completed the powered shell for its first data center powered by a 2.5-gigawatt nuclear power station, World Nuclear News reported on January 18.\n\nThe 48-megawatt, 300,000-square-foot data center is directly connected to the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in northeast Pennsylvania, and its 1,200-acre campus is expected to host Bitcoin mining and cloud computing services \u2013 the first of its kind in the U.S.\n\nSolving the energy \u2018trilemma\u2019\n\nCommenting on the development, Cumulus Data and Talen Energy CEO Alex Hernandez said:\n\n\u201cOur flagship Cumulus Susquehanna data center campus is positioned to welcome its first tenant and commence commercial operations this year. We look forward to advancing our mission to solve the energy \u2018trilemma\u2019, which we define as the rapidly increasing consumer demand for zero-carbon, low-cost, and reliable electricity by data center customers.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, on top of this 48-megawatt powered shell, two additional ones are in advanced development in phase 1 of the project, with a planned aggregate capacity for the campus of 475 megawatts. Cumulus Data had also identified another 18 Talen Energy sites with the potential for data centers directly connected to the power station.\n\nThe development of the zero-carbon Bitcoin mining facility called the Nautilus Cryptomine at the campus was first announced in August 2021, when Talen Energy signed a deal for a joint venture with a U.S.-based cryptocurrency mining firm TeraWulf.\n\nAlthough the operations on the construction of the Bitcoin mine were briefly suspended in early December last year, TeraWulf recently said it was in the early phase of ramping up its mining operations, for which it expects to provide 50 megawatts of net mining capacity in Q1 2023.\n\nEnvironmentally friendly Bitcoin mining\n\nIn another low-cost Bitcoin mining effort, the Virunga National Park in eastern Congo is mining Bitcoin using hydro-electricity to provide the necessary funding to protect the forests and wildlife in Africa\u2019s oldest protected park, affected by years of militia violence, deforestation, and poor government assistance.\n\nZero-carbon Bitcoin mining is possible using sunlight as well, with the help of solar panels. In order to successfully operate this way, an Antiminer S19, which uses 72 kWh per day, would require a 14 kWh solar system, or about 35 standard 400-watt solar panels.\n\nIn March 2022, Finbold also reported on Peter Egyed, also known as AZ Hodl, installing an off-grid solar array for his Bitcoin mining operation, for which he expected to make a return on investment (ROI) within 36 months."

        "title": "Someone illuminated a massive Bitcoin logo on Berlin's iconic TV tower - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency space continues to grow, and proponents of the sector are using different means to drive attention to assets like Bitcoin (BTC). One of the growing methods to push Bitcoin into the public eye is using symbolic global structures to promote the asset.\n\nIn particular, on January 21, the iconic Berliner Fernsehturm tower in Berlin was illuminated with the image of the Bitcoin logo as part of an advertising campaign, according to Documenting Bitcoin.\n\nThe #bitcoin logo is on the Berliner Fernsehturm tower in Berlin right now pic.twitter.com/Wn2b3koWUH \u2014 Documenting \u20bfitcoin \ud83d\udcc4 (@DocumentingBTC) January 21, 2023\n\nThe group or individual behind the initiative has yet to be identified, but a user named Tilo Neumann on Twitter has been promoting the campaign. In this line, Neumann proceeded to share a video of the projected Bitcoin logo.\n\n\u201cBerlin is definitely not rich, that\u2019s probably true. Nevertheless, \u201cwe\u201d want to draw attention to Bitcoin . After all, it is about our financial future. Some people sit down on a street and stick to it \u201cwe\u201d have decided to do it differently,\u201d Neumann said.\n\nInterestingly, this is not the first time the logo has been projected on the monument. According to a tweet by Neumann, the first attempt to project the logo was unsuccessful due to the use of poor projectors.\n\nAls wir das letzte mal vor Ort waren, war unser Beamer nicht Stark genug um dich zu erobern. Wenn wir das n\u00e4chste kommen, schaffen wir dich\ud83d\udc40 Die Vorbereitungen laufen, Gestern mehrere Beamer getestet, es wird wohl doch ein Laserbeamer werden.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 #Bitcoin #orangepillen #BTC pic.twitter.com/rj9Ez3Fe97 \u2014 Tilo Neumann (@neumi85_btc) November 26, 2022\n\nImplication of Bitcoin logo projection\n\nNotably, the Berliner Fernsehturm is a major tourist attraction and city symbol. The tower, which stands 368 meters tall, offers panoramic views of Berlin and is one of the tallest structures in Europe. Therefore, the projection of the logo on the Berliner Fernsehturm tower can be viewed as a powerful symbol highlighting the growing acceptance and awareness of Bitcoin.\n\nNotably, as per Neumann\u2019s Twitter activity, he has been involved in other campaigns of advertising Bitcoin on historic buildings and sites. For instance, in November last year, he shared that a logo was projected on the historic site of the Berlin wall.\n\n\u201cNothing in Berlin is as steeped in history as the Berlin Wall. That\u2019s why we carried out our campaign here this time. This place represents endless suffering. In contrast, Bitcoin stands for hope, the hope for a fair and free world,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin ads in Hong Kong\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin previously reported that massive advertising posters backing Bitcoin were plastered on a tram station located in front of HSBC Hong Kong headquarters back in September 2020. The ads were sponsored by the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong (BAHK).\n\nThe latest campaign coincides with a time when Bitcoin is rallying, with the asset breaching the $23,000 level.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Bitcoin proponents have been pushing the mainstream adoption of the asset. One of Bitcoin\u2019s selling points is the ability to solve some of the shortcomings in the traditional finance sector, like solving inflation due to its fixed supply.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin Poker \u2013 Top 10 Bitcoin Online Poker Sites in 2024\n\nBitcoin and online poker is a match made in heaven. Why?

You\u2019ll find a wide array of professional and amateur poker tournaments on the site, including various WSOP Circuit satellites that can earn you a place at one of WSOPC\u2019s competitions.

Bovada is user-friendly, whether you access it via desktop or mobile. Moreover, it features several interesting fast game modes, including Zone Poker.

This currency was said to have been invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, although the real name of its inventor remains in the dark. The core idea behind Bitcoin is to provide users with almost complete anonymity with each transaction.\n\nThe key thing that you have to realize about Bitcoin is that it doesn\u2019t have a physical form; only balances that are safeguarded on a public ledger which is accessible by everyone. Bitcoins are not associated or backed by any bank or government, which makes it particularly appealing for players that can\u2019t use traditional payment methods in real-money poker sites due to governmental restrictions.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to get down to the nitty-gritty of all the technicalities involved with Bitcoin, because it may be a bit overwhelming. And honestly, you don\u2019t need to worry yourself with learning all the terminology in order to use Bitcoin for playing online poker. So, we\u2019ll show you straight away how to deposit and withdraw Bitcoin on poker sites.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning the mechanics of Bitcoin, here\u2019s a handy video that could help you get familiar with the subject.\n\nWeUseCoins\n\n\n\nHow Do Bitcoins Work?\n\nIt\u2019s quite a simple procedure of buying and selling bitcoins using regular money from the currency of your choice. Namely, there are multiple services which can be accessed online, offering bitcoins for sale.\n\nThe interesting segment about this phenomenon is how to explain its value. Overall, one can perceive at as intrinsic value, interconnected with the actual bitcoin. Just like anything else on the market, it can fluctuate in regards to its supply and demand ratio.\n\nTypes of Bitcoin Poker Rooms\n\nThere are three types of poker rooms which allow players to participate with bitcoin as a currency.\n\nThe first type is bitcoin-only poker sites. These are specialized poker sites which only allow players who use bitcoin as a method of payment. Here, there is no other option, which is why there are no currency convertors. In this line of thought, there is not fee for conversion as well. The second type is bitcoin-inclusive poker sites, as these online poker rooms have the standard array of accepted currencies, but they also accept players who use bitcoins. A convertor is provided here, as bitcoins understandably vary in value from one currency to the next. As for the final type, it\u2019s important that you know how bitcoins are actually kept and stored. Namely, e-wallets have been present for quite some time in this field, which makes them a familiar term by now. Considering their digital \u2018physique\u2019, bitcoins are stored in such e-wallets. Hence, there are also poker rooms which allow bitcoins as a payment method, but only through Neteller.\n\nHow to Use Bitcoin on Online Poker Sites \u2014 Step-by-Step Guide\n\nRegister on a Crypto Exchange Platform In order to use BTCs on poker sites, you must obtain them first.

The procedure may seem daunting, but after a while, you\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s actually easier to withdraw from poker sites using Bitcoin than the traditional credit card or wire transfer.\n\nAdvantages of Using Bitcoin for playing Online Poker\n\nUsingcan seem a bit complex for beginners, but in reality, it\u2019s easy as pie. We\u2019ll walk you through the entire process.\n\nAlthough certain skeptics may appear a bit surprised by the end of this list, the use of bitcoin does have a beneficial effect. To be quite frank, using Bitcoin in poker sites is not all roses. But let me assure you that there isn\u2019t such a thing as a perfect payment method \u2014 they all have their own pros and cons.\n\nCompared to other payment providers, Bitcoin is vastly beneficial to poker players and I\u2019m going to explain why.\n\nEasier Accessibility Poker is a part of the heavily regulated online gambling industry. In most countries in the world, gambling laws are strict, and not everyone has the luxury of being able to access their favorite poker rooms. US poker fans certainly know what I\u2019m talking about. Even if you manage to find a poker site that accepts players from your country, or go to an offshore-based poker site, you may not be able to deposit funds to it. For instance, most banks in the US will not authorize payments targeted towards out-of-state regulated poker sites. By using Bitcoin, you can circumvent these nagging restrictions. As we said earlier, Bitcoin is not subject to any governmental or banking laws. That means that if you manage to find a Bitcoin poker site, there is no law or regulation that could prevent you from making a deposit.\n\nUnrivaled Anonymity Bitcoin is tailor-made for the poker industry due to the level of anonymity it provides. Some of the finest poker sites prioritize anonymity and that gives them the edge over their competitors. Privacy is much sought-after by undercover poker players. It allows them to win real money at poker tables without revealing their real name and address. Not only does Bitcoin provide anonymity at the poker table, but it also allows players to transfer winnings to a bank account without having to elaborate where they came from. This is particularly beneficial for those living in countries where gambling winnings are taxable.\n\nLow to Non-Existent Fees decentralized digital currency, and as such, allow players and poker operators to transfer value directly. This eliminates the need for the middle man to take their cut. Therefore, the fees are lower. It\u2019s a win-win situation for everyone. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, were created as adigital currency, and as such, allow players and poker operators to transfer value directly. This eliminates the need for the middle man to take their cut. Therefore, the fees are lower. It\u2019s a win-win situation for everyone. Transferring bitcoin to real-money poker sites might only involve mining fees, which are quite low. Or in some instances, the poker operator itself may charge a fee. But generally, Bitcoin fees are much lower compared to those of traditional payment methods.\n\nTop-Notch Safety Due to its cryptographic nature, Bitcoin is probably safer than traditional payment methods. Bitcoin transactions are verified and encrypted several times at various points on the network. Furthermore, once you make your Bitcoin deposit on a real-money poker site, the funds will go directly into cold storage with keys that are kept safely offline and away from prying eyes. I have yet to hear about a major theft on a Bitcoin poker site.\n\nUndeniably Fair Putting your faith in a poker operator may be easier said than done, especially if you\u2019ve heard of all those rogue platforms where players got ripped off. As a player, how can you be sure that the flop, the turn, or the river aren\u2019t rigged in favor of the poker site? That\u2019s where BTC poker sites come into play. Bitcoin and crypto gambling sites use algorithms for generating odds that are provably fair, courtesy of blockchain technology \u2014 the underlying technology of all cryptocurrencies. All the top poker sites integrate provably fair features to ensure that their games are genuinely fair and random.\n\nDisadvantages of Using Bitcoin for Playing Online Poker\n\nBitcoin is slowly gaining momentum in the poker industry, but it has not yet been adopted by all the biggest poker sites. That means that the number of Bitcoin-friendly poker platforms is still limited.\n\nAnother drawback of using Bitcoin in online gambling is that its value is widely unstable and unpredictable. This may not present an obstacle for casual players, but for high stakes players, it can be a deal-breaker.\n\nLast but not least, you can only access Bitcoin physically from whatever device you\u2019re using. What this means is that Bitcoins could get permanently lost in case of a hard drive crash, or if your device gets stolen. With no way of getting them back, you could lose a massive amount of money in only a few seconds.\n\nBitcoin Poker Sites vs. Real-Money Poker Sites\n\nThere are several differences between Bitcoin and traditional payment methods, such as credit/debit cards and e-wallets. For one, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are not dependent on banks like e-wallets, for example.\n\nBitcoin uses wallets, which are similar in concept to your e-banking or PayPal/Skrill/Neteller wallet. The big difference between using a Bitcoin wallet and a payment provider like PayPal is that the latter is tied to a bank account, which means that it\u2019s more prone to hacker attacks and account freezes.\n\nAlso, Bitcoin fees are much lower than fees associated with using credit and debit cards on poker sites, or even e-wallets, for that matter.\n\nAnother difference is seen in the speed of transactions. Bitcoin transactions are lightning-fast, even when withdrawing funds from poker sites, which isn\u2019t the case with all payment methods, particularly bank wire transfers that take several working days to process.\n\nConclusion\n\nThat\u2019s it guys \u2014 you now have the knowledge to use Bitcoin in online poker sites. It has a bit of a learning curve, no doubt about it. The upside is that, once you get the hang of it, it\u2019s actually one of the most straightforward payment methods, with a lot less friction than credit card or wire transfer.\n\nSince there aren\u2019t many Bitcoin poker sites to choose from, it may be easier for you to simply pick one from my site. All of my picks are reliable and safe, and I\u2019ve been using these poker sites myself for years now.\n\nIf I can be of assistance with anything else, feel free to contact me \u2014 I\u2019ll be more than willing to help you out.
