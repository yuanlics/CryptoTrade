        "title": "Crypto Poses Significant Tax Problems\u2014and They Could Get Worse - International Monetary Fund",
        "content": "Crypto assets that can be used as instruments of payment have proliferated into more than 10,000 variants since the 2009 debut of Bitcoin, the first and still the largest. The bewildering speed with which they have developed and the pseudonymity they can provide have left tax systems playing catch up.\n\nIn a new paper, we discuss how governments can address the emerging challenges of taxing these crypto assets while its use is still limited so that they prevent a leakage in tax revenue and protect the integrity of the tax system.\n\nClassifying crypto\n\nViews of crypto assets are diverse and held with passion. The prospect of liberating financial transactions from oversight by governments and the involvement of financial institutions is a libertarian dream for some. El Salvador and the Central African Republic have gone so far as to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nCritics, however, see crypto assets as not merely inherently worthless but a front for crime, scams, and gambling. They also point to their dizzying volatility. Bitcoin, for instance, soared from $200 a decade ago to nearly $70,000 in 2021 before plunging to around $29,000 today.\n\nThe collapse of FTX last year and recent US Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase have fed anxiety among users while the appeal to criminal activities has been reflected in high-profile seizures of billions of dollars. These developments have triggered increasing scrutiny from policymakers and widespread calls for regulation.\n\nBut whether crypto assets ultimately boom or bust, a coherent way to tax them is needed.\n\nA key issue is how to classify crypto assets\u2014should they be regarded as property or currency? When crypto is sold for profit, capital gains should be taxed as they would be on other assets. And purchases made with crypto should be subject to the same sales or value-added taxes, or VAT, that would be applied for cash transactions.\n\nSo, one important task is to ensure application of these principles, which requires clarity on how to characterize crypto for tax purposes: in essence, as currencies for VAT and sales taxes and as assets for income tax purposes. While this is not easy due to the evolving nature of crypto asset transactions, it is perfectly possible. The deepest challenges are then in enforcement.\n\nRevenue considerations\n\nCrude estimates suggest that a 20 percent tax on capital gains from crypto would have raised about $100 billion worldwide amid soaring prices in 2021. That is about 4 percent of global corporate income tax revenues, or 0.4 percent of total tax collection.\n\nBut with total crypto market capitalization down 63 percent from the late-2021 peak, tax revenues would then have shriveled. If these losses were fully offset against other taxes, there would be a corresponding reduction in revenue. In more normal times and with the current market size, global crypto tax revenues would probably average less than $25 billion a year. That, in the broader scheme of things, is not a huge amount.\n\nThere are also important fairness issues at stake. Though their pseudonymity makes it hard to be sure exactly who holds crypto, there are signs that ownership is heavily concentrated among the relatively wealthy\u2014even though holding of crypto is strikingly common across people with low incomes too. Available surveys indicate that about 10,000 people hold one quarter of all Bitcoin.\n\nThere is also VAT. Crypto transactions have similarities to those in cash in their potential for being hidden from tax administrations. Today, the share of purchases made with crypto is still small. But widespread use, if tax systems were not prepared, could someday mean widespread evasion of VAT and sales taxes, leading to materially lower government revenues. This may be the biggest threat from crypto.\n\nAddressing implementation\n\nThe most fundamental difficulty in taxing crypto assets is that they are \u201cpseudonymous.\u201d That is, transactions use public addresses that are extremely difficult to link with individuals or firms. This can make tax evasion easier. Implementation is thus at the heart of the matter for tax authorities.\n\nThe problem is surmountable when people transact through centralized exchanges, since these can be made subject to standard \u201cknow your customer\u201d tracking rules, and possibly withholding taxes. Many countries are putting such rules in place with the expectation that tax compliance will improve.\n\nHowever, reporting obligations could induce people to keep tax authorities ignorant by instead using centralized exchanges abroad. To address that concern, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has developed a framework for crypto-related exchange of information between countries. Implementation, however, is some way off.\n\nA more troubling possibility is that reporting rules (and the failures of some crypto intermediaries) could induce people to transact increasingly through decentralized exchanges or directly through peer-to-peer trades where no central governing body oversees these transactions. Those are still extremely difficult for tax administrators to penetrate.\n\nGiven the complexity of the fundamental challenges posed by pseudonymity, the rapidity of innovation, the vast information gaps, and the uncertainties ahead, the tide has not yet turned in the battle to incorporate crypto properly into the wider tax system. Some of the elements needed for doing so\u2014such as clarity in their classification for tax purposes\u2014are clear.\n\nBut the challenges are fundamental, and the risks, particularly to the VAT and sales taxes, may be greater than people recognize. As many (though far from all) governments are beginning to realize, policymakers need to develop clear, coherent, and effective frameworks for taxing crypto."

        "content": "Investors who want to bet on Bitcoin may soon have more options to choose from if US regulators soften their opposition to exchange-traded funds tied directly to Bitcoin holdings. Major financial firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco have submitted applications to sell US \u201cspot\u201d Bitcoin ETFs that would be physically backed by actual Bitcoin. In the past, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has routinely rejected these products, citing wariness over volatility and potential manipulation. Investors took the BlackRock filing, in particular, as a sign that the SEC was close to dropping its longtime opposition to such financial projects. Bitcoin prices hit a one-year high in the days after BlackRock\u2019s application.\n\nETFs, a $7 trillion industry , are part of a broader family of products known as exchange-traded products, though people frequently use \u201cETFs\u201d to refer to all of them since they are by far the largest and most popular category. Crypto-native firms and major Wall Street financial institutions alike are trying to launch a kind of ETF that actually holds Bitcoin, as opposed to the products that invest in Bitcoin futures. The SEC hasn\u2019t approved any applications for these so-called spot Bitcoin ETFs, whereas multiple futures-backed crypto funds already exist in the market. Futures-backed Bitcoin ETFs have been available to US customers since 2021. Issuers and investors are advocating for spot Bitcoin ETFs to be similarly accessible to retail and institutional investors in the US, a development that\u2019s perceived as having the potential to greatly broaden participation in the cryptocurrency industry."

        "content": "BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Bitcoin is an \u201cinternational asset\u201d in an interview that comes just weeks after the world\u2019s largest asset manager applied to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business, Fink added that instead of putting money into gold to hedge against inflation, investors could buy Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe role of crypto is digitizing gold in many ways,\u201d he said.\n\nFink added that BlackRock has worked closely with regulators in the past on ETF applications and hopes the firm\u2019s track record will help this latest application get approved.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do with crypto is make it more democratized, and make it much cheaper for investors,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough the BlackRock CEO admitted he originally was skeptical of crypto, because it was used as a payment method for illicit activities, he\u2019s since changed his mind.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is an international asset\u2014it\u2019s not based on any one currency\u2014so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative,\u201d he said.\n\nBlackRock filed an application to create a spot Bitcoin ETF last month and was quickly followed by several other TradFi firms, including Fidelity. The asset manager has a near-perfect record with getting ETFs approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, but the agency has never accepted an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock faced a setback last week when the SEC called its application inadequate, the Wall Street Journal reported. On Monday, Nasdaq, the exchange that would be listing BlackRock\u2019s ETF, resubmitted the firm\u2019s application.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has trended upward in recent weeks. The cryptocurrency hit a 52-week high at the end of June, and has since mostly held above $30,000. It was trading down about 1%, near $30,500, as of Wednesday afternoon."

Maybe.\n\nYears later, though, he admitted that Bitcoin was a \u201cgreat asset\u201d and that BlackRock had, in fact, made money from investing in the digital currency.

And so, we hope that our regulators look at these filings that as a way to democratize crypto and we'll see in the future how that plays out\" he added.\n\nBlackRock, last month, became the latest to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot Bitcoin ETF.

The company\u2019s decision to take steps to offer its clients exposure to the digital asset are likely to bring a surge of institutional adoption to the space.\n\nThe company also recently resubmitted their filing after the SEC responded that the initial filings required more information in regards to the exchange\u2019s involved, subsequently adding Coinbase to the filing, as other firms refiling did.\n\nAnd now, BlackRock\u2019s CEO, Larry Fink, has made an appearance on Fox Business where he stated that the role of bitcoin and crypto is \u201cdigitizing gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation \u2026 or the devaluation of your currency \u2026 [bitcoin] can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative,\u201d Fink stated. The description reinforces the perception of bitcoin as a store of value, akin to the role gold has traditionally played in investment portfolios. By likening bitcoin to gold, Fink acknowledges the international nature of the digital asset, highlighting its potential as a global store of wealth \u2014 and indeed, during his news appearance, Fink further emphasized that, \"Bitcoin is an international asset.\"\n\nThe televised statement underscores the conviction Fink, and likely BlackRock, have in bitcoin and its potential role in the future. Fink's recognition of bitcoin's international appeal further bolsters the case for increased institutional interest and investment.\n\nBlackRock's pursuit of a Bitcoin ETF and Fink's endorsement of bitcoin as digitized gold reflect a notable shift in the attitude of major financial institutions toward bitcoin. These developments suggest that BlackRock, along with other industry giants, recognizes the potential of bitcoin to reshape the financial landscape.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

Ethereum also logged gains amid institutional interest, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Polygon led the winners and Litecoin the losers.\n\nCrypto\n\nBitcoin rose 1.83% over the last 24 hours to US$31,142 at 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving up 2.85% for the past seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached a high of US$31,371 early Tuesday morning, the highest since June 2022.\n\nBlackRock submitted an amended application for a spot Bitcoin ETF on Monday, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said BlackRock\u2019s original filing was inadequate. BlackRock indicated in the new filing that Coinbase, the custodian of the proposed ETF\u2019s Bitcoin holdings, will provide market surveillance to support the ETF, according to a Bloomberg report on Tuesday.\n\nSeveral other financial institutions have filed Bitcoin ETF applications despite a crackdown last month by the SEC, which filed lawsuits against Binance.US and Coinbase last month for allegedly violating securities laws in trading cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn emailed comments, Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of digital asset exchange BTSE, said the SEC criticism of the application caused some selling last week, but \u201cinvestors remain quietly optimistic about future approvals.\u201d\n\nEther gained 1.18% to US$1,954.24, and added 5.23% for the week.\n\nBitcoin and Ether have both seen increased interest from financial institutions in the past week, according to a Monday report from European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares.\n\nBitcoin-linked digital asset investment products saw net inflows of around US$123 million in the week ending June 30, while Ethereum-linked products had net inflows of around US$2.7 million. Digital asset investment products have seen two weeks of net inflows since June 19, after logging 9 weeks of consecutive outflows.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin tokens traded higher in the past 24 hours, with Polygon\u2019s Matic token spearheading the rally with a gain of 4.60% to US$0.7119. It\u2019s up 10.18% for the week despite the U.K.-based fintech neobank and crypto exchange Revolut plans to delist Polygon, Solana and Cardano tokens for its U.S. users in September, according to a report by the Block on Monday.\n\nLitecoin led the losers in a potential price correction, falling 5.83% to US$106.69. It still logged weekly gains of 22.47% driven higher by the token\u2019s upcoming third halving event on August 2, which will make the token scarcer.\n\nLitecoin investors also received a boost after the token was selected to trade on the newly established EDX Markets exchange, which opened on June 20 and is backed by Wall Street heavyweights, including Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap rose 1.28% to US$1.22 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume rose 26.34% to US$37.86 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nNFT volumes gain\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the main Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.08% in the 24 hours to 09:40 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,750, down 5.06% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Ethereum and Polygon NFT markets logged moderate increases.\n\nNFT trading volume on Ethereum rose 18.72% in the past 24 hours to US$27.29 million, according to CryptoSlam data, while Polygon\u2019s volumes surged 121.63% to more than US$1.89 million. Trading volumes also rose on the Bitcoin, Solana and BNB Chain networks.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), the second largest NFT collection by market cap, saw trading volume jump 52.56% to US$4.98 million, with Ethereum-based NFT collections Azuki and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) ranking the second and the third.\n\n\u201cA bit of a rebound today on the ETH side, which is in the green for the first time in days. Top collections like Bean, Azuki, and MAYC have had increases in their floor prices 7-20% and even BAYC has slowed its decline,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nHowever, the floor prices of some major NFT collections are still holding considerable losses for the past week, with BAYC floor price falling over 20% in the past seven days and Azuki sliding more than 50% over the same period, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nAzuki Elementals are a collection of 20,000 NFTs launched on June 27 as a spin-off of the original Azuki collection. While the Elementals sold out within 15 minutes, collectors started to complain that the supposed new NFTs looked almost identical to the original Azuki collection.\n\nAzuki DAO, a community of dissatisfied Azuki holders, was formed last week and passed a vote on Monday to launch a lawsuit against Azuki creator Chiru Labs, claiming the 20,000 ETH (US$39 million) the company holds should be returned to the DAO to \u201cpromote the growth of the entire Azuki community.\u201d\n\n\u201cNFT platforms have experienced an increase in trading volume in recent days, while the prices of blue-chip NFTs have declined,\u201d said Gracy Chen, managing director at digital asset trading platform Bitget, in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market is undergoing a major adjustment, but a decline does not necessarily indicate the decline of the entire industry,\u201d said Chen. \u201cAs NFT derivatives, including lending, indexes, perpetual contracts, and other products, are gaining traction, price fluctuations become more pronounced in the short term.\u201d\n\nU.S. futures dip\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded flat to lower as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures inched down 0.01%, S&P 500 futures dipped 0.04%, and Nasdaq futures fell 0.12%. The three major U.S. indexes closed higher in the regular Monday session, shortened ahead of the July 4 public holiday when the market is closed.\n\nIn Asia, mainland China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index closed 1.31% higher on Monday, despite the country\u2019s softening manufacturing recovery. South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose 1.49%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the gainers in the region with a 1.7% increase, according to CNBC on Monday.\n\nThe U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) dropped to 46.0 in June, the lowest since May 2020, according to a Monday report by the Institute of Supply Management (ISM). A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing and below 50 a contraction.\n\n\u201cCompanies reduced production and began using layoffs to manage head counts, to a greater extent than in prior months, amid mixed sentiment about when significant growth will return,\u201d wrote ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee Chair Timothy Fiore in the report.\n\nThe June PMI is the eighth consecutive month of contraction and is lower than the projection of 47.0, raising concerns about a recession, according to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nNew York Federal Reserve President John Williams\u2019 speaks on Wednesday and may provide an update on the Fed\u2019s view of inflation. The Fed releases its June meeting minutes on Wednesday, where it decided to leave interest rates unchanged between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 89.9% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, up from 87.4% on Monday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at just 10.1%.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"

        "title": "Less than 10% of all bitcoin trading volume happens in the US: CCdata - Blockworks",
        "content": "A small fraction of bitcoin trading volume, just 9.49%, exist on registered US crypto exchanges, leaving tons of transactional revenue off the table for platforms like Coinbase and Kraken.\n\nAnd a newly released report from CCData suggests that American exchanges have been giving up more and more of their share of bitcoin (BTC) trades since at least January 2023, with March being an uncharacteristically good month.\n\nSo where is all this bitcoin volume?\n\nThe data suggests that bitcoin trading volume, as well as the volume for most other tokens, remains on Binance. In June, users traded $239 billion worth of crypto on Binance\u2019s spot markets, representing a 12.6% jump from May.\n\nCoinbase, which CCData noted represents 61% of bitcoin trading volume among US exchanges, has a much smaller share of the total pie with just $30 billion compared to Binance\u2019s nearly quarter of a trillion.\n\nAnd Kraken\u2019s total spot trading volume was half that of Coinbase at $16.2 billion.\n\nCCData researchers added the caveat that despite firms like Binance experiencing incremental increases in spot trading recently, \u201cspot trading volumes on centralized exchanges remain at historically low levels, recording the lowest quarterly volumes since Q4 of 2019.\u201d\n\nThe data also points to the fact that offshore crypto exchanges are starting to get rewarded in terms of market share. The lawsuits against Binance, Binance.US and Coinbase, however, coincide with a decrease in their market share in June.\n\nBybit, which is headquartered in Dubai, experienced about a 0.5% and 1.3% increase in market share during June and May, respectively. Bullish and Upbit, both of which reside outside of the US, also saw jumps in their business over the last two months, according to CCData.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s also important to note that crypto derivatives trading volume is far greater than spot volume, a trend that began in 2021, according to CCData.\n\nIn fact, the derivatives made up nearly 79% of the entire crypto market in June. Binance once again captured the majority of it at 56.8%. Kraken is the next closest American competitor to Binance, but doesn\u2019t even come close. Similarly, Coinbase doesn\u2019t even crack the top eight firms in terms of derivatives.\n\nSource: CCData June Exchange Review\n\nAfter Binance, which notably claims it does not have a static headquarters, the rest of the biggest firms who deal in derivatives are all based outside the US. Seychelles-based OKX had 19.5% of the derivatives market share in June, and in third place was Bybit with 12.6% of the market. Bitget, also registered in Seychelles came in fourth.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "It seemed like a perfectly believable story: Two teenagers in Canada posed as members of Coinbase\u2019s support team and scammed an American man out of $4.2 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAfter seeing an email with a news release about the supposed arrest of the teenagers, a reporter from the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC), one of Canada\u2019s leading news outlets, ran the since-deleted story, according to a member of the Hamilton Police Service familiar with the matter. (However, whether that email was the ultimate source for the story has yet to be determined.) The police in Hamilton, a city near the border of New York, reportedly teamed up with the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force to pin down the two 17-year-olds, who went by the aliases \u201cFelon\u201d and \u201cGaze.\u201d\n\nNews of the arrest of the teenagers, who, according to reports, used some of their $4.2 million in stolen crypto to buy coveted username @zombie on Instagram, then spread across a number of crypto publications. However, the entire story\u2014from the teenagers\u2019 alleged heist to their arrest\u2014is a sham, according to the Hamilton Police Service.\n\n\u201c[We] can confirm this investigation did not occur and the email did not originate from the Hamilton Police Service,\u201d the police said in an official statement. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The CBC has since removed its original story, and its URL now redirects to a new piece describing how its reporter received a hoax email.\n\n\u201cCoinbase has extensive security resources dedicated to educating customers about preventing phishing attacks and scams,\u201d a spokesperson for the exchange said in a statement. \u201cWe work with international law enforcement to ensure that anyone scamming Coinbase customers is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d\n\nWhile several publications were duped into running a lurid story of yet another crypto arrest, the theft as described would not have been the first of its kind.\n\nIn January 2018, in the village of Irvington, N.Y., 15-year-old Ellis Pinsky, nicknamed \u201cBaby Al Capone,\u201d allegedly stole almost $24 million from crypto millionaire Michael Terpin. Pinsky agreed to pay back Terpin without admitting any guilt.\n\nAnd the Hamilton Police Service itself has investigated and arrested a teenager for stealing almost $35 million in crypto through a SIM swap attack, or when scammers port a victim\u2019s phone number over to their devices to bypass two-factor authentication.\n\nThe investigation and arrest, which happened in 2021, echoes the spoofed news release, including the Hamilton police partnership with the FBI and U.S. Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force as well as the stolen crypto being spent on a rare online username.\n\nUpdate, July 5, 2023: This article has been updated with an official comment from the Hamilton police as well as more information about the CBC."

        "content": "After a roller-coaster 18 months, bitcoin\u2014not necessarily the entire U.S. cryptocurrency market\u2014may be on the cusp of a bullish run in the second half of 2023, according to analysts from Adamant Research and Standard Chartered bank. The key driver could be greater adoption by traditional financial firms.\n\nKey Takeaways Renewed push by traditional financial firms for bitcoin spot ETFs may boost bitcoin prices.\n\nAnalysts say the worst of the bitcoin bear market is over, prices may cross $100K over the next couple of years.\n\nRegulatory developments and outcomes of important legal battles between the SEC and crypto platforms could have big impact on crypto markets\n\nA recession driven by government policy could help the crypto market if it's perceived as a decentralized safe haven.\n\nTraditional Financial Firms May Boost Bitcoin Prices\n\nA string of crypto-related bankruptcies starting mid-last year and peaking with the collapse of FTX in November, had many investors losing faith in crypto markets. However, bitcoin prices recently got a second wind as a number of companies, including Blackrock (BLK), Fidelity Investments, Invesco (IVZ) and Wisdomtree (WT) doubled down on their applications for spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs.)\n\n\n\nWorst May Be Over For Bitcoin Prices, Say Analysts\n\nAdamant Research indicates that an accumulation phase for bitcoin will continue in the $22,000 to $42,000 range before the crypto asset eventually hits a new all-time high north of $120,000 as a result of a multi-year bull run.\n\nAdamant Research was one of the first firms to put out a report on bitcoin more than 10 years ago in November 2012. Each subsequent report released by the firm in 2012, 2015, and 2019 came at a time when bitcoin and the greater crypto markets were at historically undervalued levels, and they released their latest report in April 2023.\n\nWhile potential downside risks, such as regulatory crackdowns and liquidations by large holders, are also discussed, the report points to continued high levels of inflation and a troubled bond market as two of the factors that will contribute to the coming bitcoin bull market. Additionally, the report claims investors would be better off sticking with bitcoin rather than holding a diverse set of crypto assets.\n\nAn April 2023 note from Standard Chartered Bank also predicted that the prolonged crypto winter has come to an end, and bitcoin may surge to $100,000 by the end of 2024, Reuters reported. The note suggested that several factors, including the solvency crisis in the banking sector, have restored bitcoin's reputation as a decentralized, scarce digital asset.\n\nStandard Chartered analysts expect the bitcoin price to continue climbing as the broader macro backdrop for risky assets improves, particularly as the Federal Reserve moves away from its policy of tightening. Additionally, bitcoin's upcoming halving event in 2024, when the reward for miners will be halved, is anticipated to further bolster its value.\n\nWatch Out For Regulatory Developments\n\nOver the past few months, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cracked down on a number of cryptocurrency firms such as Binance, Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken. One of the regulator's main contentions is that it considers non-bitcoin crypto assets as securities and has taken action against crypto platforms for the sale of unregistered securities.\n\nAny developments in legal battles such as the Ripple Labs v. SEC case to determine whether the XRP token is a security or the SEC v. Coinbase case on whether staking as a service construes as a sale of unregistered securities could have broader implications for the crypto markets.\n\n\n\nWhat Would a U.S. Recession Mean for Crypto?\n\nA possible U.S. recession could impact crypto asset prices and demand for high-risk assets, but it could also be bullish for crypto in a situation where the recession is caused by poor government policy while crypto is viewed as a decentralized, digital safe haven, according to a May report from S&P Global.\n\nAdditionally, the report covers the potential utility of crypto in countries dealing with heavily depreciating currencies. However, S&P analysts say there is no conclusive data available on whether crypto an act as a useful inflation hedge.\n\n"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -0.07%) had a miserable 2022, and the token remains down by more than half from its all-time high. Investors are still digesting a wave of negativity, which included the collapse of several cryptocurrency exchanges last year, not to mention some of the industry's most prized stablecoin experiments.\n\nBut the crypto winter might be thawing, because Bitcoin has gained an impressive 84% in 2023 so far, outpacing traditional asset classes, including the stock market. The leading cryptocurrency has regained the attention of some Wall Street analysts, including the managing partner of Fundstrat, Tom Lee, who recently told CNBC he thinks it could be on its way to $200,000.\n\nLee has been spot on about the stock market lately, so it's worth paying attention to his call on Bitcoin. Here are the details.\n\nWhy investors went cold on the crypto industry\n\nThe decentralized concept behind cryptocurrencies resonates with many consumers who might have some level of distrust for the traditional banking system, and even their governments. But last year, they learned the true value of regulation.\n\nThe crypto industry suffered a plethora of high-profile collapses, with the TerraUSD stablecoin wiping out an estimated $60 billion worth of value seemingly overnight. Then, just months later, one of the largest cryptocurrency brokerages in the world -- FTX -- was found to have misappropriated customer funds. Investigations are ongoing, but as it stands, FTX customers are owed an estimated $3 billion.\n\nIf those funds were held with a U.S. bank instead of being held offshore in places like the Bahamas, account holders would have automatically been insured for up to $250,000, thanks to the government-backed Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). But unfortunately, FTX customers face the real prospect of a total loss.\n\nBeyond those failures, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin haven't made much progress with respect to adoption as a payment mechanism. According to Cryptwerk, just 8,091 businesses around the world accept Bitcoin for the sale of goods and services, a drop in the bucket considering more than 330 million registered companies exist as of this writing.\n\nVolatility has likely played some part. Bitcoin's large price swings aren't an attractive feature for consumers who might want to spend it as a currency, because its purchasing power would fluctuate drastically from month to month. Tom Lee touched on that point in his interview with CNBC, saying Bitcoin trades like a risk-on asset, which follows the moves in the stock market.\n\nThat stacks up, given the major stock market indexes crashed last year just like Bitcoin, and both are trading comfortably in the green in 2023.\n\nTom Lee thinks $200,000 is on the table for Bitcoin\n\nLee has been bullish on Bitcoin for years. Back in May 2021, he predicted the token would close that year at a price of $100,000 -- it didn't happen, so it's always important to be mindful of the risks when buying speculative assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nNonetheless, Lee cites a few reasons the token could climb over the next few years. He thinks it's particularly important that large asset managers like BlackRock are stepping into the crypto industry, filling the void left by bad actors like FTX. BlackRock recently filed to list a Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF), and there is speculation the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might be on its way to approving it, despite being opposed to such securities in the past.\n\nFidelity Investments has also just applied for a Bitcoin ETF. As more trusted, well-known firms on Wall Street throw their hats into the ring, the SEC might find it harder to justify further rejections. After all, its job is to protect investors, and having them place funds in the hands of regulated financial institutions in the U.S. is preferable to them sending money offshore to unregulated brokerages.\n\nWhen it comes to setting a price target, Lee has referred to the work done by Ark Investment Management and the firm's CEO, Cathie Wood. Ark's base case is for Bitcoin to reach $600,000 per token by 2030, and it says there's even potential for it to reach $1 million in more bullish conditions. Wood has cited this year's regional banking crisis as a driver of Bitcoin adoption, and Lee says her idea of network value for Bitcoin and its scarcity suggest a price of \"$200,000 plus\" might be possible.\n\nStill, setting price targets based on those factors requires a huge amount of guesswork. Bitcoin generates no revenue or earnings, so pinning down a true value the same way you would for traditional financial assets is practically impossible.\n\nIt's unlikely any of these factors will draw consumers into the Bitcoin ecosystem, so it might still be relegated to the whims of speculators. But credible U.S. firms becoming more active in the space could entice a more conservative investor class into the asset, which is a positive in the long term. Personally, I wouldn't bet my money on Bitcoin soaring 549% from here to reach $200,000, especially with plenty of other exciting and much safer opportunities out there."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether fell during Wednesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong but remained above key price levels, while most of the top altcoins were in the red. The altcoin bear market could last another two to six months, due to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) moves against these tokens, industry experts told Forkast.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin breaches US$31,195 following Fidelity\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application\n\nBitcoin, Ether, most top 10 cryptos decline except Doge, Sol\n\nBitcoin inched down 0.21% from 7:20 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong to US$30,735. Ether fell 0.61% in the same period to trade at US$1,929, floating above US$1,900 since Sunday.\n\nOn Tuesday, the price of Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, rose to US$31,371, its highest since June 2022, over optimism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications by a raft of Wall Street heavyweights, including Blackrock.\n\nWhile both Bitcoin and Ether remain firmly above key psychological levels, altcoins seem to lack momentum compared to the two largest cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThe delisting of specific assets from US cryptocurrency exchanges in June has accentuated a demarcation in asset performance that has existed since the start of the bear market in 2021,\u201d Jamie Coutts, a senior market structure analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Forkast in a statement.\n\n\u201cAssets deemed commodities, Bitcoin and Ethereum (although not enshrined), have generated a collective return shy of 70% year-to-date and are 58% from their all-time highs. Meanwhile, SECurities have averaged a paltry 18.87% languishing 84% below their all-time highs,\u201d wrote Coutts, adding that the altcoin bear market could last another two to six months.\n\nAltcoins have suffered from the SEC\u2019s crackdown on tokens that they deem financial securities. Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB were among those that the regulator named as unregistered securities in its lawsuits filed against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges in early June.\n\nLitecoin was the day\u2019s biggest loser in the top 10, falling 2.65% to US$104.49, followed by Binance\u2019s BNB token that decreased 1.20% in the past 24 hours to trade at US$242.29.\n\nDogecoin increased 0.45% to US$0.06858, followed by Solana\u2019s Sol token that inched up 0.26% to US$19.20, as the day\u2019s only two gainers in the top 10 cryptos.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 0.89% to US$1.2 trillion and market volume decreased 27.35% to US$27.24 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nEthereum, BAYC NFT sales drop, Bitcoin Ordinals extend gains\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.83% to 2,770.49 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 3.35% during the week.\n\nAfter a weak Tuesday, Bitcoin\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token sales rose 41.21% to US$3.53 million, as sales for $FRAM BRC-20 NFTs rose 3.19% to US$1.36 million.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales fell 22.24% to US$19.07 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, fell 20.44% to US$2.33 million, but Mutant Ape Yacht Club sales rose 29.44% to US$2.3 million.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects declining sales prices across collections on all chains, but it\u2019s Ethereum that\u2019s really dragging the market down with it,\u201d said Petscher, pointing to the recent problems with the Azuki NFT collection.\n\n\u201cAzuki\u2019s struggles exasperated the already struggling market \u2026 Azuki\u2019s new Elementals mint was supposed to be a boom for NFTs and instead was a bust, becoming a catalyst that drove NFT collections down to all-time lows.\u201d\n\nAzuki sales continued their fall, decreasing 16.36% to US$1.66 million, after the new Azuki Elementals collection was criticized for being too similar to the original. The Azuki Elementals collection began minting last Tuesday and sold out in 15 minutes, but left collectors disappointed as the latest collection looked almost the same as the original.\n\nAmong the Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast SOL NFT Composite was the only one in the red, falling 0.75% to 791.91 points.\n\nAsian equities, U.S. stock futures fall, as investors brace for more rate hikes\n\nMajor Asian equities weakened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, as investors were cautious ahead of Chinese inflation data scheduled for release later this week, with the risk of deflation still weighing on the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nThe Caixin China General Composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) \u2014 a measure of the performance of both the manufacturing and services sectors in China \u2014 dropped to 52.5 in June from 55.6 the previous month. This marks the sixth consecutive month of expansion for China\u2019s private sector. However, the growth rate was the slowest since January.\n\nEmployment in China also returned to growth, as the service sector created more jobs following a drop in manufacturing payrolls, according to Trading Economics.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.25% and the Shenzhen Component Index fell 0.91%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index lost 1.57% and the Shanghai Composite decreased 0.69%.\n\nU.S. stock futures also fell during Wednesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, as investors were concerned that continued monetary tightening could lead the U.S. economy into a recession.\n\nThe S&P 500 futures index slipped 0.33%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures weekend 0.48% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.3%.\n\nInvestors now anticipate the release of the minutes of June\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, scheduled for later today, for more clues on the central bank\u2019s upcoming monetary decisions.\n\nMarkets are expecting another 25 basis point interest rate hike this month, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that more rate increases are needed to bring inflation to the target 2%.\n\nSee related article: EU publishes draft bill for digital euro and cash payments\n\nUpdates with equities section."

        "content": "Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, has delivered pro-crypto remarks amid the asset manager applying to list a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States.\n\nSpeaking on Fox Business on July 5, Fink said the role of cryptocurrency was largely \u201cdigitizing gold,\u201d suggesting U.S. regulators consider how an ETF directly linked to Bitcoin (BTC) could democratize finance. During his time at BlackRock, Fink has often commented on major events affecting the crypto space, including the collapse of FTX in 2022 and rising interest in BTC.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Bitcoin is an international asset,\u201d said Fink. \u201cIt\u2019s not based on any one currency, and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.\u201d\n\nFink suggested that investors could turn to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or the devaluation of certain currencies. As CEO of the largest asset management firm in the world, with more than $9 trillion in assets under management as of April, Fink\u2019s pro-crypto sentiment could create ripples in and out of the space.\n\nRelated: Developed markets lagging behind in digital payments: BlackRock CEO\n\nMany crypto users on social media reacted positively to Fink\u2019s interview, with at least one suggesting his words could cause the price of certain assets to surge in what the user called the \u201cFink Pump.\u201d At the time of publication, the BTC price was $30,473, having dropped by roughly 1% in the previous 24 hours.\n\nUnder Fink, BlackRock has attempted to launch a spot BTC ETF with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase acting as a surveillance partner. It\u2019s unclear if the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve the investment vehicle, given its track record of rejecting all previously filed spot BTC ETF applications to date.\n\nMagazine: Gary Gensler\u2019s job at risk, BlackRock\u2019s first spot Bitcoin ETF and other news: Hodler\u2019s Digest, June 11-17"

        "content": "With the Bitcoin (BTC) halving event less than a year away, several financial giants have filed applications for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) \u2014 a scenario last seen before the 2020 to 2021 bull run.\n\nInstitutional interest in the sector dried up after major crypto giants such as FTX collapsed amid a prolonged crypto winter in 2022. Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies traded largely sideways as several crypto exchanges fell under regulatory scrutiny.\n\nHowever, on news that major financial institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Valkyrie and others were filing applications to list a spot Bitcoin ETF, the price of BTC recovered to over $30,000, spurring investment into the crypto market again.\n\nBitcoin one-month price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nWhile several institutional giants have filed spot Bitcoin ETF applications with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the past, all have either withdrawn their applications or faced outright rejections from the regulator.\n\nThe SEC approved the first Bitcoin futures ETF in October 2021 \u2014 the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF \u2014 which debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 19, 2021.\n\nHowever, the spot Bitcoin ETF filing by the asset management giant BlackRock has increased the chances of the SEC approving the first spot Bitcoin ETF. That\u2019s according to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who gives BlackRock a 50% chance of getting its spot Bitcoin ETF approved.\n\nThe most recent spate of ETF filings began with BlackRock\u2019s filing with the SEC on June 16. WisdomTree, Invesco and Valkyrie also filed in the days and weeks that followed.\n\nRecent: Chibi Finance $1M alleged rug pull: How it happened\n\nOn June 28, ARK Invest, which previously filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June 2021, amended its filing to make it similar to that of BlackRock. The next day, asset manager Fidelity Investments also filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF. In total, seven institutional giants have now filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF to date.\n\nSome industry observers believe 2023 to 2024 will be crucial for approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. Robert Quartly-Janeiro, chief strategy officer of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitrue, told Cointelegraph that the timing is right, as \u201cinflation is rampant and the money supply is a mixed picture, interest rates are high, and businesses are seeing decent revenues, which means crypto will need to perform in an economic environment where rates and inflation are key considerations.\u201d\n\nInstitutional trust in Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin has weathered the aftermath of 2022 remarkably well and recovered more than half of its price decline during the bear market, largely thanks to the continued interest of institutional investors in the asset.\n\nIndeed, there are significantly more institutional investors in the crypto market now compared with only one year ago. Until 2022, institutions kept a safe distance from the market, with even MicroStrategy stopping its routine BTC purchases.\n\nMany large funds and companies have become interested in cryptocurrencies and are exploring their potential to invest in them.\n\nDespite market volatility, global institutions show a steady interest in cryptocurrencies. Bitfinex chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin represents tremendous value in terms of its utility and unique nature as a perfectly scarce asset that cannot ever be debased. He said, \u201cThe most traditional financial institutions recognize that,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s hardly surprising that at a time of record inflation in both major industrialized economies, as well as emerging markets, that the value of Bitcoin is being better understood by markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe recent new applications for Bitcoin spot market ETFs by some of the world\u2019s most important asset managers demonstrates that there is investor, as well as issuer demand for Bitcoin, and that will only intensify. Apart from demonstrating increased institutional demand for Bitcoin, it will also attract new retail investors and encourage broader participation,\u201d Ardoino said.\n\nWhile many institutions distanced themselves from crypto over the past year, much of that was due to the public relations disaster brought on by FTX, with bank failures further exacerbating it. Richard Gardner, CEO of Modulus, told Cointelegraph that institutions foresaw the simmering of the crypto industry, and decided to lay low and sidestep the political and public response in the aftermath of FTX, thinking they\u2019d be able to revisit their decision before crypto surged.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the point where they\u2019re beginning to weigh the risk versus reward of stepping back into the fray. Most institutions will likely be far more cautious, given the FTX disaster. They\u2019re going to largely be moved based on the regulatory environment. As governments cobble together a full regulatory regime, and as bureaucrats decide how they plan to interpret the law, institutions will gauge their response and move forward accordingly,\u201d Gardner said.\n\nMicroStrategy \u2014 the leading investor in Bitcoin and one of the driving forces behind institutional adoption of BTC in 2020 \u2014 has continued its Bitcoin buying spree in 2023. When the firm faced major losses as the BTC price plunged below $16,500, CEO Michael Saylor maintained it had no intention of selling and would continue to add more BTC to its treasury. MicroStrategy currently hodls 152,333 BTC acquired for roughly $4.52 billion at an average price of $29,668 per Bitcoin.\n\nInstitutional inflow revives bull run optimism\n\nWhile the 2017 bull run was sparked by retail interest, the 2020 to 2021 bull run was sparked by institutional inflows, with the likes of MicroStrategy and Tesla, and multiple other publicly-listed companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet.\n\nGracy Chen, managing director at crypto exchange Bitget, told Cointelegraph that institutions would act swiftly once they observe \u201cstable and predictable retail interest.\u201d Chen said, \u201cThe cumulative impact of institutions outweighs that of individual investors, and, therefore, they will continue to be a driving force for the growth of cryptocurrency market capitalization.\u201d\n\nShe also stressed that growing interest from institutions could further crypto adoption, helping to spark the next bull run:\n\n\u201cAnalysts expect that in the event of the approval of BlackRock\u2019s ETF application alone, there could be a twofold increase in the price of Bitcoin. Considering BlackRock\u2019s potential institutional investor base and influence, the approval of their spot BTC ETF would have a greater impact on the crypto market growth. With their BTC spot ETF application, they will likely inspire competition among relevant financial companies. This will direct more funds from traditional markets to Web3.\u201d\n\nApart from the institutional push, there have been major developments in the retail market, with Hong Kong opening the doors for crypto exchanges to offer services to retail customers. Ben Caselin, vice president at crypto exchange MaskEX, told Cointelegraph that during the previous bull run, \u201cU.S. institutions were the primary drivers of the upsurge, but they were arguably not ready to engage deeply and behaved no different than retail, essentially chasing gains and acting on hype.\u201d\n\nMagazine: How smart people invest in dumb memecoins: 3-point plan for success\n\n\u201cI expect this bull market to be Asia driven once again, perhaps with Hong Kong at the helm for the region, but based on my personal observations on the ground, I also expect a significant push to come from the Middle East, particularly from the United Arab Emirates, Saudia Arabia and other oil-rich jurisdictions,\u201d he added.\n\nWith the next Bitcoin halving scheduled for April 2024, the rising interest of institutional investors is seen as a bullish sign for Bitcoin\u2019s price and the broader crypto market. Bull runs have historically started in the run-up to the Bitcoin halving event, where the amount of BTC reward per block gets reduced by half every four years. The scarcity factor drives the price surge as retail traders and institutional giants rush to add to their Bitcoin portfolios."

        "content": "The crypto market took a beating at the end of last year. The bankruptcy of FTX amid an alleged fraud dragged the prices of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, to multiyear lows. However, Bitcoin dismissed regulatory scrutiny and more than doubled this year from the trough of last year.\n\nAn improved economic environment coupled with new institutional participation in the crypto market encouraged investors to pile into the world\u2019s numero uno cryptocurrency, resulting in a price surge that exceeded gains in the stock market.\n\nAnd as market pundits expect Bitcoin\u2019s epic run to continue in the second half of this year, stocks such as HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. HIVE, Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. MARA and Bitfarms Ltd. BITF are poised to gain.\n\nBitcoin Witness a Remarkable Surge\n\nThe price of Bitcoin, has recently breezed past the psychological threshold of $31,000 and established a solid support level. Notably, the price of Bitcoin notched its best first half of a year since 2019. The price of the largest-digital asset even surpassed the tech-laden Nasdaq\u2019s best first-half gains in four decades.\n\nMoreover, on Jul 4, Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume soared 47.2% in 24 hours, a clear indication of investors\u2019 interest in the digital asset. Bitcoin\u2019s price, by the way, continues to hover above the 200-day simple moving average, indicating further upswing.\n\nWhat\u2019s Behind the Bitcoin Rally?\n\nBitcoin is zooming up, and it\u2019s partly because of the Federal Reserves\u2019 pause in interest rate hikes in its last policy meeting held in the month of June. Needless to say, an increase in interest rates was always a headwind in 2022, as higher rates weighed heavily on high-risk assets such as digital coins and tech stocks.\n\nMeanwhile, the banking sector turmoil in March 2023 that heightened worries about an impending recession was also a blessing in disguise for Bitcoin. This is because, during such a crisis, many investors saw the digital asset as a safer investment than some of the regional banks.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut most importantly, it\u2019s the renewed interest among large traditional financial institutions in crypto, including Bitcoin, that drove its prices northward. Financial bigwig BlackRock, Inc BLK, has applied, urging regulators to create a Bitcoin ETF. If the proposal gets accepted by the supervisory body, retail participation will increase and open opportunities for more institutional backing.\n\nSimilarly, financial heavyweights such as The Charles Schwab Corporation SCHW, Citadel Securities and Fidelity Digital Assets, to name a few, backed a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets. The exchange allows the trading of Bitcoin along with other prominent digital assets.\n\nCrypto Stocks to Make the Most of the Bitcoin Rally\n\nFrom an investment perspective, if you are looking to make money from Bitcoin\u2019s current upsurge, it would be judicious to approach it in a roundabout way, by keeping an eye on companies that make use of Bitcoin and technologies that support it, like blockchain.\n\nFirst on the list is HIVE Blockchain, which is one of the traded Bitcoin miners. As a thumb rule, miners do have negative margins when the price of Bitcoin falls below $20,000. But now, since the price is above this threshold, HIVE Blockchain\u2019s profit margins are positioned to improve.\n\nThe Canadian Bitcoin mining company posted solid financial results in June, while its shares have surged 248.7% so far this year, backed by the Bitcoin rally. In comparison, the broader S&P 500 Index has gained 17.1% in the same period.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHIVE Blockchain\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 54.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HIVE\u2019s current-year earnings has moved up 6.6% over the past 60 days. HIVE Blockchain has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.\n\nAnother Bitcoin mining company, Marathon Digital, is experiencing exponential growth this year. This is because Bitcoin miners\u2019 shares have a direct relationship with the price of Bitcoin. The profitability of Marathon Digital\u2019s mining operation will improve banking in the value of Bitcoin.\n\nShares of Marathon Digital outperformed the S&P 500 Index year to date, by gaining a whopping 348%.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMarathon Digital\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 113.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MARA\u2019s current-year earnings has moved up 525% over the past 60 days. Marathon Digital has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nAlso, Bitfarms specializing in mining Bitcoin, is expected to witness growth momentum soon. Its shares may have gained less than MARA stock, but it has reduced its debt considerably and has increased its mining capacity, which makes it all the more enticing for investors.\n\nBitfarms shares have skyrocketed 270.5% so far this year, thereby easily outdoing the S&P 500 Index.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBitfarms\u2019 expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 86.1%.

        "content": "Bitcoin, Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell on Thursday morning in Asia as the U.S. public holiday this week slowed trading and some investors seemed to be taking profits off recent gains. Bitcoin is still up 1% for the week, with BlackRock\u2019s head Larry Fink backing the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency as having the potential to revolutionize finance. Litecoin and Cardano led the losers.\n\nBitcoin driver\n\nBitcoin fell 1.06% over the last 24 hours to US$30,465 at 06:35 a.m. in Hong Kong, while its weekly gain stood at 1.02%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The token, which had a market cap of US$591 billion as of Thursday, has risen 83% so far this year in a rebound from the bear market slump in 2022.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is still the main driver of trading volume albeit that is also soft \u2013 no doubt linked to the July 4th U.S. public holiday washing through,\u201d said Caroline Bowler, the chief executive officer of Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets, in a text message to Forkast.\n\n\u201cWe may be seeing the effects of this reduced liquidity and greater asset concentration playing out, with some greater price sensitivities in trading,\u201d Bowler added. \u201cThe industry is coming out of the prolonged bear market so this is to be expected.\u201d\n\nThe price dip came after a run up in many tokens sparked by growing optimism around the possible approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., which will open the cryptocurrency to a wider pool of investors.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager that oversees about US$10 trillion, filed applications to launch the first publicly traded spot Bitcoin ETFs on June 15. It refiled the application on Monday after the regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, reportedly said it was lacking in detail.\n\nLarry Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc., said Wednesday that he wanted to \u201cdemocratize\u201d cryptocurrencies with the ETF filings, in an interview with Fox Business. Fink also said Bitcoin is an international asset that could revolutionize finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nEther lost 1.55% to US$1,911, though it was holding onto a gain of 4.40% for the past seven days.\n\nAll other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization lost ground, with Litecoin and Cardano leading the losing pack.\n\nLitecoin slipped 3.84% to US$102.19 in what appeared to be profit taking after the token gained ahead of its halving on Aug. 2 and its listing on EDX Markets, the Wall Street-backed crypto exchange in the U.S. that opened on June 20. Litecoin is still up 22.72% on the week.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA lost 3.60% to US$0.2843 while adding 5.61% for the week. Today\u2019s correction also seemed linked to profit-taking, even as parent company Input Output Global Inc. on Wednesday released Marlowe, a so-called toolset to build smart contracts on the blockchain.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 1.32% to US$1.19 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume rose 0.58% to US$31.27 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nBlurry outlook for NFTs\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.96% in the 24 hours to 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,801.94, but logged a loss of 1.72% for the week. While the Forkast Ethereum NFT index rose, the indexes measuring the performance of Solana, Polygon and Cardano-based NFT markets all declined.\n\nInvestors remain basically pessimistic, said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cForkast 500 NFT Index is up almost 1%, though still has traders wondering if this is a dead cat bounce, or if there is enough value with these discounted NFT prices that collections have fallen to recently,\u201d Petscher said. \u201cMost are betting this is not the bottom, and a new update from the Blur marketplace has traders worried.\u201d\n\nBlur marketplace took the NFT world by storm when it launched last November, and its 30-day trading volume surpassed previous NFT leader OpenSea in February. Blur picked up more steam when it launched Blend, a peer-to-peer lending protocol for NFTs on May 2.\n\nBlur is expanding its popular reward system that distributes $Blur tokens to users that have met certain criteria as \u201cairdrops,\u201d but Petscher says this could be bad news for NFTs overall.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bBlur is introducing rewards for trait offers, which means traders who bid on specific NFT traits on select projects will receive Blur reward points. These points will contribute to the amount of $Blur tokens that traders will receive at the end of Blur\u2019s season 2 airdrop,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nThis will lead to more farmers \u2014 buyers that generate income through staking NFTs \u2014 to prevail in the market over pure collectors.\n\n\u201cThe concert with the new mechanic is that traders will artificially inflate the rarer NFTs in collections, as you receive more points the higher a bid is from the floor price of the collection,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the new trait offers affect NFT prices, but it\u2019s expected to continue artificially inflating NFT prices, and then culminate in floor crashes like we saw recently.\u201d\n\nBy NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club topped the trading volume rankings on Cryptoslam with US$3.76 million, with the volume surging 74.52% on the day. Uncategorized Bitcoin Ordinals \u2014 unique digital assets on the Bitcoin network that are not identified as part of one established collection \u2014 placed second by transactions volume, rising 22.03% to US$1.86 million.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 4.61% to US$28.3 million. Volume on Ethereum fell 9.36% to US$19.3 million according to Cryptoslam data. Volume on the Bitcoin network gained 11.97% to US$3.69 million, while volumes on Polygon, Solana and BNB also rose.\n\nEquity futures slip\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen | Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures dipped as of 10:45 a.m. Thursday in Hong Kong, pointing to another down day for stocks that fell during regular trading on Wednesday. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq all declined by about 0.1%.\n\nMinutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s June meeting showed most Fed officials favor more interest rate increases this year, adding to the conviction the U.S. will raise rates again this month, according to Trading Economics. This concern hit Asian equities as well.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all moved lower. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite managed a marginal gain of 0.1% on Thursday.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen arrives in Beijing on Thursday and investors anticipate that the meetings she will have through July 9 may help stabilize relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies, currently marked by sanctions and distrust.\n\nOn economic indicators, the U.S. releases initial jobless claims and the services purchasing managers\u2019 index on Thursday.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 88.7% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, up from 87.4% on Tuesday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at 11.3%.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

        "title": "Bitcoin ETFs: Even worse for crypto than central exchanges - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Recent weeks have seen a surge in interest from traditional finance for crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). After the Securities and Exchange Commission took issue with its initial filing, BlackRock submitted a fresh application for a Bitcoin ETF on July 3. A week earlier, Fidelity led a crop of investment firms in lodging applications with the SEC for Bitcoin-based ETFs. Meanwhile, HSBC has become the first bank to offer Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs to customers in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the context of Bitcoin, it is often the seemingly positive news that is harmful over the longer term; and vice versa, short-term negative news often serves to strengthen the ongoing case for Bitcoin. A good example of the latter is the 2017 \u201cBlocksize War,\u201d when the Bitcoin community split into the big block camp that launched the Bitcoin Cash fork and the small block camp that implemented the Segregated Witness upgrade in Bitcoin.\n\nWhile the result was chaotic in the short term \u2014 with many a Bitcoin critic seeking to dance on Bitcoin\u2019s grave \u2014 it proved to be one of the most important lessons on decentralized consensus and paved the way for the layered scaling via the Lightning Network that we enjoy today.\n\nFor an example of good news turning negative, we don\u2019t have to go too far back into the past. Up until late 2022, FTX was the prime example of crypto going mainstream, with its Superbowl ads, stadium naming rights and glossy magazine features. But in the end, FTX proved to be a ticking time bomb that blew up in everybody\u2019s face and set back the industry\u2019s legitimacy by years.\n\nToday marks 10 years since @tyler and I filed for the first spot Bitcoin ETF. The @SECGov's refusal to approve these products for a decade has been a complete and utter disaster for US investors and demonstrates how the SEC is a failed regulator. Here's why:\n\n\n\n-\"protected\"\u2026 pic.twitter.com/xmK1xo1iX8 \u2014 Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) July 2, 2023\n\nAnd again, as it goes, the seemingly bad news \u2014 FTX collapsing and losing a lot of money for its users \u2014 will become positive in the long run, as people will take better care of their Bitcoin in the future, thus limiting the systemic risk of large custodian blow-ups.\n\nEvade the fakes\n\nAs we saw with the implosion of FTX and the subsequent market contagion, centralized exchanges were never the answer for everyday investors looking to benefit from the immense promise of Bitcoin. Neither are ETFs. Bitcoin-linked ETFs are an even worse idea than centralized exchanges, as there is zero possibility of withdrawing the underlying instrument \u2014 that is, the Bitcoin. This means the holders are never able to take advantage of the single most important feature of Bitcoin: the ability to control their funds without a need to trust anyone.\n\nRelated: Don\u2019t be naive \u2014 BlackRock\u2019s ETF won\u2019t be bullish for Bitcoin\n\nThere are also other dangers for the wider market. With ETFs, there is a risk that \u201cpaper Bitcoin,\u201d or claims not backed by actual Bitcoin, could distort the market and undermine Bitcoin\u2019s very monetary policy. Exchanges that have issued paper Bitcoin in the past \u2014 such as FTX \u2014 have been kept in check via withdrawal runs and eventual collapse, after which the fake Bitcoin claims were wiped out along with the hapless exchanges.\n\nThat likely wouldn\u2019t be the case with ETFs. Without the possibility of withdrawing the underlying asset, paper Bitcoin can be printed at will. If Bitcoin ETFs become the dominant way of investing in Bitcoin, it could very well lead to millions of paper Bitcoin flooding the market, suppressing the price of Bitcoin.\n\nWith Bitcoin, holding it means owning it\n\nIn the context of Bitcoin, ownership is very closely linked to control over the cryptographic keys associated with specific Bitcoin addresses. Now, it might be true that someone can own Bitcoin in a legal sense without having direct control over the keys \u2014 such as when owning an exchange account or holding an ETF share \u2014 but that is simply not a good idea in the Bitcoin world.\n\nRelated: Gary Gensler is hurting the little guys for Wall Street\n\nBitcoin\u2019s digital nature, perfect portability and global liquidity make it especially susceptible to embezzlement, theft or just basic mismanagement. The only way to truly own Bitcoin is to control the keys.\n\nSome might welcome a possible short-term price pump associated with an approval of a major Bitcoin ETF (such as BlackRock\u2019s), but the long-term impact on Bitcoin adoption would be likely negative (including the long-term price of Bitcoin). The only adoption that actually matters involves self-custody \u2014 everything else is a trap.\n\nJosef Tetek is a Bitcoin analyst for Trezor.

        "content": "The crypto market rally kicked off by BlackRock's surprise spot bitcoin exchange-trade fund filing has brought tens of millions of new inflows into a futures-based fund managed by ProShares.\n\nProShare's BITO fund saw an additional $14.9 million of inflows on June 29 and $11.9 million of inflows on July 3, bringing its total assets under management to $1.04 billion, according to ETF.com. By way of comparison, the fund's AuM on June 15 \u2014 the day on which BlackRock's ETF application was submitted \u2014 stood at $822 million.\n\nProShare's futures-based fund made its market debut in late 2021. There's a long list of issuers vying to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, which could bring further legitimacy to bitcoin as well as its underpinning market structure. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has historically denied such a product because of a lack of proper surveillance across spot trading venues.\n\nRELATED INDICES See crypto indices\n\nAs noted by European asset manager CoinShares, the crypto fund space has benefited from the excitement around a spot bitcoin ETF coming to market. Weekly inflows into crypto asset management products were strong for the second week in a row, with CoinShares reporting $125 million coming into the industry last week. That brought total inflows into such products to $334 million over the past two weeks, according to the European asset manager."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether traded little changed on Wednesday morning in Asia, while the rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed. Bitcoin fell back under US$31,000, but its dominance in total crypto market cap is gaining, a sign of market recovery. Solana added to its gains this week, while Polygon\u2019s Matic and the BNB tokens led the daily losers list. Bitcoin Cash has taken the number 12 spot in the list of top tokens by market cap after its listing on the new EDX Markets exchange.\n\nCrypto price pause\n\nBitcoin fell 1.0% over the last 24 hours to US$30,801 at 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, shaving its weekly gain down to 0.39%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. On Tuesday, the price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached US$31,371, its highest since June 2022, on the back of optimism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications by a raft of Wall Street heavyweights, including Blackrock.\n\nThe level of Bitcoin dominance sits near 50%, which is the highest since April 2021. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, says this price uptrend in Bitcoin is a typical market recovery pattern in which the most significant asset in the sector attracts buyers first.\n\n\u201cIt will probably take about a year of Bitcoin price recovery before crypto enthusiasts start looking for one with higher risk, pushing altcoins higher and leading to a new wave of capitalisation swell,\u201d said Kuptsikevich, in an email statement. He said he doesn\u2019t see altcoins rallying before November.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent price recovery was sparked by Blackrock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, filing an application last month to launch a Bitcoin ETF and refiling it again after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated it lacked details.\n\nSeveral other U.S.-based asset managers, such as Fidelity Investments and WisdomTree, have filed their own Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting mainstream finance recognizes the Bitcoin opportunity and wants to offer clients the access to its price movements without actually owning the token.\n\nEther, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, looked to be on a run to break US$2,000 this week, but fell back 0.81% to US$1,941 today after a gain of 2.64% for the past seven days.\n\nThe other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization traded mixed to flat, with Solana leading gainers with a 2.0% rise to US$19.45. The token has surged 15.35% in the past week.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic and Binance\u2019s BNB token were amongst the losers \u2014 Matic lost 1.99% to US$0.6981, though it\u2019s still up 4.29% for the week. BNB lost 1.68% to US$242.83, cutting its weekly gain to 1.81%.\n\nAltcoins have suffered from the SEC\u2019s crackdown on tokens that they deem financial securities. Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB were among those that the regulator named as unregistered securities in its lawsuits filed against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges in early June.\n\nWhile these altcoins have partially recovered after an initial plunge following the SEC suits, several trading platforms including California-based Robinhood Markets Inc., Israel-based eToro and UK\u2019s Revolut ceased support or limited access to some of these tokens for their U.S.-based customers.\n\nBitcoin Cash climbed to become the twelfth largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap at US$53.8 billion. The Bitcoin spin-off is one of the four cryptocurrencies listed on EDX Markets, the Wall Street-backed, compliance-focused crypto exchange that launched on June 20 in the U.S.\n\nBitcoin Cash had a market capitalization of US$20.6 billion and was valued at US$106.34 on June 19. It has since surged 160% to US$276.87. It dipped 1.70% in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 0.80% to US$1.21 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 22.22% to US$31.14 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nAzuki dents NFT sentiment\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index rose 1.28% in the 24 hours to 07:45 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,783.58, but logged a loss of 3.17% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Ethereum and Polygon NFT markets rose.\n\nHowever, despite moderate gains in the indexes on Wednesday morning, the NFT market overall remains in a downtrend, said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\n\u201cThe Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects declining sales prices across collections on all chains, but it\u2019s Ethereum that\u2019s really dragging the market down with it,\u201d said Petscher, pointing to the recent problems with the Azuki NFT collection.\n\n\u201cAzuki\u2019s struggles exasperated the already struggling market \u2026 Azuki\u2019s new Elementals mint was supposed to be a boom for NFTs and instead was a bust, becoming a catalyst that drove NFT collections down to all-time lows.\u201d\n\nAzuki NFT creator Chiru Labs debuted its latest Elementals collection last Tuesday, to much negative response from the community, who deemed it almost identical to the original Azuki collection.\n\nWhile the team behind Azuki posted an public apology to buyers on Twitter, dissatisfied Azuki holders formed the Azuki DAO last week and passed a vote on Monday to launch a lawsuit against Chiru Labs, claiming the 20,000 ETH (US$39 million) the company holds should be returned to the DAO.\n\nLegalDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization formed in 2020 by a group of legal professionals, said Tuesday that it will help Azuki DAO in the effort to claim the 20,000 ETH.\n\nBy NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club topped the trading volume rankings on Cryptoslam with US$3 million, but the volume was down 18.97% on the day. Mutant Ape Yacht Club, another Yuga Labs\u2019 Ethereum-based collection, saw its volume grow 11.94% to US$2.39 million to place second in the rankings.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 9.24% to US$31.5 million. Volume on Ethereum fell 9.17% to US$22.7 million according to Cryptoslam data. Volume on the Bitcoin network gained 3.73% to US$3.19 million, while volumes on Polygon, Solana and BNB all plunged.\n\nU.S. equity futures drop during holiday\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nU.S. stock futures dipped as of 10:45 a.m. in Hong Kong ahead of the restart of trading in the U.S. following the July 4 public holiday.\n\nFutures on all three indexes \u2013 Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq \u2013 declined but by less than 1%.\n\nAsian equities opened lower Wednesday morning. The Shanghai Composite fell 0.5%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dipped 1.3%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index edged down 0.3%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi also lost 0.08%.\n\nThe Caixin China General Composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) \u2014 a measure of the performance of both the manufacturing and services sectors in China \u2014 dropped to 52.5 in June from 55.6 the previous month. This marks the sixth consecutive month of expansion for China\u2019s private sector. However, the growth rate was the slowest since January.\n\nEmployment in China also returned to growth, as the service sector created more jobs following a drop in manufacturing payrolls, according to Trading Economics.\n\nIn the U.S., New York Federal Reserve President John Williams\u2019 speaks on Wednesday and may provide an update on the Fed\u2019s view of inflation. The Fed will also release its June meeting minutes on Wednesday, where it decided to leave interest rates unchanged between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting on rates is July 26. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 87.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, down from 89.9% on Tuesday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at just 12.6%.\n\n(Updates to add equities section)"

We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this article began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets\u201d which includes one US dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nThe Latest Crypto Data (through July 4, 2023): Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rally continued for a third straight week as the digital currency briefly crossed $31,000 during this past week. BTC is now up ~84% year to date.\n\nXRP dropped slightly from last week and is currently up ~41% year-to-date.\n\nEther\u2019s rallied continued for a second straight week and is currently up ~59% year-to-date.\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI).\n\nOriginally published on Advisor Perspectives.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "title": "Can Bitcoin repeat a 2017-like rally as dollar correlation reverses? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "There is a common belief that when the U.S. dollar declines relative to other main global currencies, as measured by the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), the impact on Bitcoin is positive, and vice versa.\n\nFor instance, the DXY dropped from 103.0 in January 2017 to a 92.6 low in August 2017, while Bitcoin (BTC) rallied from $1,000 to $4,930 in the same period. But is there enough evidence to justify a bull run similar to 2016\u201317, as some analysts are arguing?\n\nIs the Bitcoin-dollar inverse trend real?\n\nTraders and influencers frequently warn about this negative correlation and how a reversal of the DXY will likely push the Bitcoin price higher.\n\nInvestment researcher Game of Trades recently posted a chart presenting the pattern in early 2023 and then again in May. There\u2019s some indisputable evidence of the inverse correlation there.\n\nBitcoin and DXY have maintained a negative correlation year-to-date in 2023 pic.twitter.com/VTePX3PNs6 \u2014 Game of Trades (@GameofTrades_) June 22, 2023\n\nMoreover, technical analyst Moustache presents a bearish \u201cGaussian Channel\u201d change on the DXY chart, which, according to the analysis, matched two previous bull runs for Bitcoin and altcoins in 2016\u201317 and 2020\u201321.\n\n#Bitcoin\n\n\n\nThe DXY (US Dollar Index) has changed the color from green to red on the Gaussian Channel.\n\n\n\nThe last two times this happened, $BTC and Altcoins experienced a bullrun (parabola) in the following months (2016-2017 and 2020-2021).\n\n\n\nSounds exciting, doesn't it? pic.twitter.com/kHJeM6iZDH \u2014 \u24d7 (@el_crypto_prof) June 26, 2023\n\nBTC-DXY correlation varies with time\n\nThe seemingly inverse relationship between Bitcoin and the DXY has never lasted more than seven weeks. The correlation indicator runs from negative 100%, indicating that certain markets move in opposite ways, to positive 100%, indicating that the movement is in lockstep; 0 represents a total lack of correlation between the two assets.\n\nDXY 20-day correlation versus Bitcoin. Source: TradingView\n\nThe metric has been negative for 81% of the past 670 days, indicating that DXY and Bitcoin have generally followed an inverse trend. Still, that\u2019s not how the correlation metric works, because readings between 0% and negative 50% denote a lack of correlation.\n\nIn fact, the longest-ever period of a correlation lower than negative 50% was the 47 days starting on Aug. 18, 2022. Therefore, saying that Bitcoin has an inverse correlation to the DXY would be statistically incoherent since it was negative 50% or lower for less than a third of the days since September 2021.\n\nBetween June 2021 and November 2021, the DXY and the BTC price presented a very similar pattern, as both rallied during that five-month period.\n\nEvents solely relevant to the cryptocurrency might have distorted the metric, however, such as the first Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund in the United States, launched on Oct. 19, 2021.\n\nDXY (orange, left) versus Bitcoin (blue, right), 2021. Source: TradingView\n\nBut regardless of the rationale behind the move, correlation is not causation, meaning it is impossible to conclude that DXY\u2019s positive performance affected Bitcoin's price during the period.\n\nRelated: Will BlackRock\u2019s ETF slingshot Bitcoin\u2019s price skyward?\n\nLonger-term analysis still required for DXY\n\nEven though analysts and market influencers frequently use 20-day correlation data to explain daily price fluctuations, a longer time frame is required to comprehend potential, if any, effects of DXY on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nFor instance, when the U.S. Federal Reserve injects trillion-dollar stimulus packages into the economy, odds are the impact on inflation and global currency flows will take a couple of weeks. After all, not every family, business and financial institution will put the money into circulation right away.\n\nBut the price signals on the Bitcoin market are more immediate, as coins are traded 24/7. So the price movements are extremely susceptible to news, macroeconomic data and geopolitical events, with reverberating effects for weeks and even months.\n\nA perfect example can be demonstrated by Bitcoin\u2019s 38% loss in nine days on June 8, 2022.\n\nDXY (orange, left) versus Bitcoin (blue, right), 2022. Source: TradingView\n\nNotice how it took almost four months for the DXY to move from 102.50 to the 114.2 peak in late September 2022, even though Bitcoin had already bottomed at $18,900 long before that.\n\nDXY a poor proxy for BTC price\n\nIn other words, those betting on a DXY reversal preceding a BTC price rally have no statistical support, given that the correlation varies over time.\n\nMoreover, even when the inverse correlation happens, there may be a gap between Bitcoin\u2019s immediate price action and the longer-term trends of the U.S. Dollar Index.\n\nWhenever favorable (or unfavorable) developments in the cryptocurrency industry occur, the historical correlation becomes irrelevant. That might have been the case for the recent Bitcoin gains, which can\u2019t be directly attributed to the supposed \u201cGaussian Channel\u201d reversion on the DXY chart.\n\nUltimately, cherry-picking two or three instances of the DXY inverse correlation happening while a cryptocurrency bull run occurred in the past is not enough to call a bull run similar to 2016\u201317, considering the multiple instances of positive correlation and gaps between both assets\u2019 price action.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin futures premium hits 18-month high \u2014 Time to flip bullish? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The Bitcoin futures premium reached its highest level in 18 months on July 4. But traders are now questioning whether the derivatives metrics indicate \u201cexcessive excitement\u201d or a \u201creturn to the mean\u201d after a prolonged bear market.\n\nBTC price gains capped by regulators, macroeconomics\n\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price has been trading in a narrow 4.4% range since June 22, oscillating between $29,900 and $31,160 as measured by its daily closing prices. The lack of a clear trend might be uncomfortable to some, but that is a reflection of the opposing drivers currently in play.\n\nFor instance, investor sentiment was negatively affected by the historic inversion of the Treasury yield curve in the United States, which reached its highest level on record.\n\nU.S. 10-year / 2-year spread. Source: Real Investment Advice\n\nThe closely monitored inverted spread between the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes has reached its highest level since 1981, standing at 1.09%. The phenomenon known as yield curve inversion, when shorter-dated Treasury notes trade at higher yields than longer-dated notes, typically precedes economic recessions.\n\nRelated: Fed pauses interest rates, but Bitcoin options data still points to BTC price downside\n\nOn the other hand, signs of strength in the U.S. economy have reportedly driven investors to price in the possibility of further interest rate increases by the central bank to keep inflation under control.\n\nIn addition to these macroeconomic distortions, cryptocurrency regulation has also been at the center of investors\u2019 attention as of late. Here are just some recent examples:\n\nThe exchange Kraken was required by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to provide details of users who engaged in transactions exceeding $20,000 within a calendar year.\n\nThailand\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission banned crypto lending services, thus prohibiting crypto platforms from offering any form of return on deposited crypto by customers.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore announced new requirements for crypto service providers to hold customer assets in a statutory trust by year-end.\n\nSo investors are probably now asking: Does Bitcoin have the strength to break above the $31,000 resistance? Of course, one must take a potential economic recession and the increasing regulatory clampdown measures around the world into account first.\n\nLuckily, Bitcoin futures contract premiums can provide some clues for traders about the market\u2019s next move for reasons discussed below \u2014 as well as the costs of hedging using BTC options.\n\nBitcoin futures premium reaches 18-month high\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.\n\nAs a result, BTC futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe demand for leveraged BTC longs has significantly increased over the past week, as the futures contract premium jumped to 6.4% on July 3 from 3.2% one week prior. Besides reaching the highest level in 18 months, the metric has finally moved to a neutral-to-bullish area.\n\nRelated: \u200b\u200bHere\u2019s what happened in crypto today\n\nTo gauge market sentiment further, it\u2019s also helpful to look at the options markets, as the 25% delta skew can assess whether the price stagnation has made investors less optimistic. It reveals when arbitrage desks and market makers charge higher prices for protection against upside or downside movements.\n\nIn short, if traders expect a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price, the skew metric will rise above 7%, while periods of excitement typically have a negative 7% skew.\n\nBitcoin 30-day options 25% delta skew. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe 25% delta skew metric experienced a complete turnaround, indicating bullish momentum picked up on June 21 when it dropped below negative 7%. As Bitcoin\u2019s price climbed back above $30,000, the indicator continued to improve, culminating in \u201cgreed\u201d with a negative 13% skew on July 2.\n\nModerate optimism \u201chealthy\u201d for Bitcoin market\n\nTypically, a 6.4% futures basis and a negative 13% delta skew would be considered moderately bullish. However, considering analysts are estimating a 50% chance for BlackRock's spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, these metrics might be seen as conservative. But a certain amount of skepticism is indeed healthy for buyers using derivatives contracts and avoids the risk of cascading liquidations.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETF race begins: Has institutional trust returned to crypto?\n\nCurrently, macroeconomic factors and regulatory uncertainty likely explain the suppressed optimism for BTC derivatives despite multiple ETF requests from the world\u2019s largest asset managers.\n\nSo 18-month highs aside, the current Bitcoin futures premium remains relatively modest compared to previous instances of excessive optimism, such as the 19% premium in October 2021.\n\nThus, today\u2019s 6.3% futures premium represents a healthy market as opposed to 10% or higher indicating excessive optimism or euphoria. Moreover, traders should remain confident given that bulls have room to further leverage long positions without running excessive risk.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Investors remained optimistic after BlackRoc refiled its spot Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) application on Monday despite criticism from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of an earlier filing.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin breaches US$31,195 following Fidelity\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application\n\nBitcoin, Ether slip, top 10 cryptos mixed\n\nBitcoin slipped 0.54% from 7:50 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong to US$30,971. Ether inched down 0.15% in the same period to trade at US$1,951, remaining above US$1,900 since Sunday.\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, rose to a high of US$31,371 early Tuesday morning, the highest since June 2022.\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest money manager, refiled its Bitcoin ETF application on Monday with Coinbase as the proposed custodian, after the SEC on Friday indicated it was unimpressed by Bitcoin ETF applications from financial heavyweights such as Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cThe crypto industry is still dusting itself off from the impact of the SEC\u2019s lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase after both exchanges allegedly broke securities rules. Yet BlackRock\u2019s decision to engage Coinbase as its custodian can be seen as a positive development in Coinbase\u2019s ongoing engagement with the SEC,\u201d Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note the distinction between Bitcoin, officially categorized as a commodity, and most other cryptocurrencies, which the SEC considers securities. A Bitcoin ETF would fall under the security label and trade on a traditional exchange. While Coinbase and other exchanges face regulatory uncertainties surrounding the industry, Bitcoin remains separate from such concerns.

But Azuki sales recovered after a significant sell-off, gaining 90.3% to US$2.6 million.\n\nAzuki Elementals are a collection of 20,000 NFTs launched on June 27 as a spin-off of the original Azuki collection. While the Elementals sold out within 15 minutes, collectors started to complain that the supposed new NFTs looked almost identical to the original Azuki collection.\n\nAzuki DAO, a community of dissatisfied Azuki holders, was formed last week and passed a vote on Monday to launch a lawsuit against Azuki creator Chiru Labs, claiming the 20,000 ETH (US$39 million) the company holds should be returned to the DAO to \u201cpromote the growth of the entire Azuki community.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales fell 4.54% to US$2.49 million but sales for Uncategorized Ordinals rose 15.23% to US$1.49 million.\n\nAsian equities rise, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gains for second consecutive day\n\nImage: elements.envato\n\nMajor Asian equities strengthened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong except Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 that fell 0.98%.

        "content": "Hong Kong wants to become an international crypto hub even as jurisdictions like the US cast a wary eye on the sector. In August, the first licenses were issued under a new system to regulate crypto exchanges offering trading in tokens like Bitcoin and Ether. The regime is part of Hong Kong\u2019s effort to attract fresh capital and talent back to the city, after its reputation was tarnished by years of harsh Covid-19 curbs and a crackdown on political dissent. Initial reaction was largely positive from digital-asset firms, but there was a lack of major new investment pledges. Hong Kong\u2019s push appears to have quiet backing from Beijing even as mainland China sticks with a ban on crypto trading.\n\nThe new rules mean that retail investors can trade coins on exchanges licensed by the city\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission. Hong Kong says its approach is high on consumer protection, with strict criteria on which virtual assets can be bought and sold. Some of the factors that platforms must consider when deciding on tokens to offer include how long a coin has been in circulation, its market capitalization and average daily trading volume. The tokens must also be incorporated in at least two cryptocurrency indexes from prominent institutions, one with a background in traditional finance. In addition, the SFC mandates that crypto firms must put other safeguards in place before accepting customers, like assessing if users have essential knowledge of digital assets before investing, and setting trading or position limits \u201cwith reference to the client\u2019s financial situation.\u201d"

If machines have to pay for electricity to work, they will always use something that humans cannot control, and they will use Bitcoin, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nThe chief technology officer of Tether, the company behind the largest United States dollar-backed stablecoin by market cap, Tether (USDT), also suggested that AI would not use USDT because of its centralized nature.\n\nThe possibility of a future in which humanity coexists alongside AI in whatever shape or form could be as close as 20 or 30 years away, according to Ardoino. However, this could be determined by differing focuses on reverse aging instead of incorporating AI and bionic elements into humans to augment their physical and mental capabilities.\n\n\u201cThe future tells me that we are going toward augmented intelligence that will end up with AI co-mingling with normal brains. Maybe that is the future of humanity.\u201d\n\nThe likes of BlackRock \u2014 the world\u2019s largest asset manager \u2014 have earmarked the AI ecosystem as a prime investment opportunity, given its \u201cdisruptive\u201d nature.

        "title": "Heating a home with a Bitcoin miner: Staying warm with sats - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) miners emit a lot of heat.\n\nSome miners use that heat to warm swimming pools, dehydrate meat to make beef jerky or even dry out timber at a Swedish hydropower Bitcoin farm. In Ireland, the \u201cBitcoin Farmer\u201d joked that he hangs out laundry to dry in front of his Bitcoin miner.\n\nMiner heat is not new to the Bitcoin industry. In the early days of Bitcoin, enthusiasts would mine the cryptocurrency with their everyday computers, leading to overheating and stories of uncomfortably warm environments.\n\nBitcoin mining has changed since the early days. With the markedly increased difficulty of solving hash computations on the Bitcoin blockchain, miners have ditched ubiquitous graphics processing units for more powerful application specific integrated circuits, or ASICS. However, heating and cooling still remain an issue.\n\nIn a nod to the future of capturing waste heat, Satoshi Nakamoto shared a message showing precognition:\n\n\u201cThe heat from your computer is not wasted if you need to heat your home.\u201d\n\nSo why not take advantage of that heat and use it for productive resources? That\u2019s exactly what I wanted to experiment with at my home near Lisbon, Portugal, this winter.\n\nDo-it-yourself solutions that utilize Bitcoin miner \u201cwaste\u201d heat in the home are increasingly popular. However, it can be tricky. The #mine4heat hashtag on Twitter boasts Bitcoin hobbyists who can rewire and soundproof Bitcoin miners \u2014 without electrocuting themselves.\n\nOne savvy miner heats their mobile home, an airstream, while others have found ingenious ways to mine Bitcoin and keep their homes toasty:\n\nProud DIY basement miner dude that exhausts his heat with trash bags taped end to end when I dont need it:) pic.twitter.com/S1XTz3T08p \u2014 Barc (@Barcinthedark) April 21, 2023\n\nHowever, for the \u201caverage Joe,\u201d like me, it seems daunting. I\u2019m a technologically stunted Bitcoin enthusiast who took years to run a node. So while the idea is appealing, I feared I might burn the house down.\n\nThere are several heater-cum-Bitcoin mining companies, like Heatbit and BitHeater, which are aware of Bitcoin miners\u2019 ability to make money while heating spaces, but also that there could be pent-up demand for a plug-and-play solution.\n\nHeatbit founder Alex Busarov told Cointelegraph that while ease of use was appealing, the environmental use case for Bitcoin miner heat drove the mission: \u201cWe want to make mining truly green,\u201d he said.\n\nBusarov said, \u201cThe claims that \u2018xx%\u2019 of energy used for mining comes from renewable energy\u2019 are misleading. While the number might sound impressive, it ignores the fact that this renewable energy would have been added to the grid if not used for industrial mining.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is only genuinely green when combined with heating; this way, no extra energy is consumed by mining.\u201d\n\nBusarov referred to the statistics and claims published by Bitcoin mining advocates, including that Bitcoin is the greenest industry and that Bitcoin mining incentivizes renewable energy buildout. Nonetheless, Bitcoin miners take a lot of heat even when using waste heat for productive purposes.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin 2023 in Miami comes to grips with \u2018shitcoins on Bitcoin\u2019\n\nPersonally, I was more focused on the power draw of the Heatbit Bitcoin miners. If it consumes less electricity than my standard electric heaters, it would be a no-brainer for use over the winter \u2014 so I got my hands on one and put it to the test.\n\nThe result: for four months, I heated my small flat in Portugal with a Heatbit.\n\nSet up\n\nThe package arrived in mid-November during an unseasonably hot spell. I lugged it upstairs, unboxed it and scanned the instructions. It seemed too good to be true. The instructions are idiot-proof.\n\nHeatbit box. Cointelegraph slippers for scale.\n\nI connected the Heatbit to power, downloaded the Heatbit app, and it quickly found the Heatbit device and synchronized. I selected the hot setting and soon felt a warm stream of air coming from the vent at the top. I pushed my ear to it and was surprised at how quiet it was.\n\nBitcoin miners are very, very loud when turned up full blast. Some residents of a Norweigan town have even made noise complaints about a nearby industrial-scale Bitcoin mine, but my fridge is much louder than the Heatbit.\n\nI waited until I had mined one satoshi \u2014 less than a penny \u2014 which took about 15 minutes. By that point, the balcony enclosure of my flat was uncomfortably warm, so I turned it off.\n\nOver the next few months, I turned the heater on and off, moving it around the flat on its two rear wheels.\n\nCan you make money with it?\n\nTechnically yes \u2014 but not really. I raked in 30,000 satoshis during winter, which is just over $10.\n\nThe miner was whirring away for a couple of hours most evenings and in the mornings I was at home. Sadly, I wasn\u2019t in Portugal a great deal, with trips to Senegal, Poland and Cape Verde during the winter. Had I been home, I would have netted another roughly 50,000 sats of \u201cheat.\u201d\n\nUsing the Heatbit during winter.\n\nMoreover, my electricity bill was marginally lower than the previous winter, which is a minor success in light of double-digit inflation in Portugal.\n\nHowever, that misses the point. The Hearbit is a heater first and a Bitcoin miner second. The heat is smoother than my regular heater and requires zero maintenance (so far). Plus, as Busarov points out:\n\n\u201cWe want to decentralize mining. It\u2019s unlikely that Satoshi envisioned mining to be centralized in large farms. The ideal approach is \u2018everyone contributing a bit.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Heatbit contributes to the Nicehash mining pool. Some critics claim that mining pools lead to mining centralization \u2014 something the Bitcoin community is attempting to overcome with upcoming Stratum V2 upgrades to the mining algorithm. Nonetheless, there have been other unexpected consequences to running a Bitcoin miner.\n\nLiving with a Bitcoin miner\n\nIn Portugal, central heating is rare. Most homes I\u2019ve stayed in use oil heaters or electric heaters. The Heatbit quickly replaced my electric heater, which was more expensive due to its higher power draw. The miner is also quieter, and the heat emitted is consistent and less punchy. However, it\u2019s also 10 times the price of my electric heater.\n\nInterestingly, the Heatbit\u2019s size and stature raise eyebrows and questions like, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d among friends visiting my flat. Guests were surprised to learn that the white box was mining Bitcoin, as invariably, they thought that Bitcoin mining took place in giant data centers. I showed them how much I\u2019d earned on my phone, and, in a way, the heater is an orange pilling aid.\n\nAs Busarov explains, the point of the Heatbit \u201cis to expand the Bitcoin community.\u201d \u201cThere are far more people using electric heaters than miners,\u201d he said. Tools like easy-to-use at-home Bitcoin heater miners are another step toward greater adoption.\n\nThe downsides are the price tag and the size. The unit is large, heavy and costs over $1,000 brand-new. Given that in Portugal, I use a heater for four to five months a year, the Heatbit becomes a large paperweight from April to October.\n\nUltimately, it would take a few years to pay off at current price levels in a warm country like Portugal. Naturally, if the Bitcoin price were in the six figures, it would be a different story.\n\nMoreover, on Reddit and YouTube reviews, some users have reported problems with use and concerns about customer service.\n\nPlus, the mainstream and plug-and-play nature of the Heatbit is contrary to the ethos of the DIY Bitcoin miners, who see the company as making a profit on something a person could do themselves. And fundamentally, Bitcoin was first propagated by hobbyists, so it\u2019s understandable.\n\nDevelopers working on works on the Heatbit One prototype. Source: Heatbit\n\nTo Heatbit\u2019s credit, it listened. The company is introducing a smaller heater, the \u201cHeatbit Mini,\u201d from $299, in time for the next European winter. Busarov explains:\n\n\u201cWe also added air purifying functionality, making the device usable all year round. And, as the name suggests, the [Heatbit] Mini is smaller in size \u2014 less than 50 cm tall \u2014 making it convenient to place in any room.\u201d\n\nThe Heatbit Mini consumes 300 watts for mining and air purification, boostable to 1,300 watts of heat in the wintertime. The 300-watt setting still contributes the full 10 terrahashes per second, while the original Heatbit hash rate drops off as it dials down.\n\nRecent: Bitcoin ETF race begins: Has institutional trust returned to crypto?\n\nThat should mean you can run it all year round as an air purifier and a heater. Naturally, I\u2019ve signed up for one.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin's recent trading activity may be range-bound, but that doesn't diminish the impressive 84% surge it experienced in 2023. This significant recovery in Bitcoin's price has also spurred buying activity in various altcoins, causing them to rise substantially from their annual lows. After reaching above the $31,000 mark on June 23, Bitcoin consolidated at $30,000 throughout the past week. It currently remains near the strong resistance level of $31,000, with neither bulls or bears taking control in the larger time frame.To gain momentum, buyers must restore the rate to the $31,200 zone, potentially leading to a breakout above the $31,458 resistance level. This indicates that the bulls are not rushing to secure profits, as they expect further upward movement. Bulls have shown increased interest in Bitcoin recently, driven by the positive investor sentiment, which has been fueled by notable financial institutions such as BlockRock Invesco , and WisdomTree filing for Bitcoin ETFs However, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said these filings were inadequate last Friday, citing a lack of clarity and the need for additional information before reconsidering approval. Despite this news, BTC has maintained a positive stance well above the $30,000 level. BTC's support level currently stands at $29,500. This week will feature significant economic events in the US, including the release of the FOMC minutes for June on Wednesday, the job openings report on Thursday, and new employment numbers on Friday, which may introduce some market volatility.Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading in close proximity to the $2,000 level. Its price has gained momentum above $1,920, with immediate resistance found near $1,960 and then $2,000. Failing to surpass these resistance levels could initiate a downward correction. The current support level for Ethereum rests at $1,930.In an exciting turn of events, on Thursday the Financial Services and Markets Act, 2023 \u2014 a reform bill in the United Kingdom \u2014 received Royal Assent from King Charles, officially transforming it into a law. With the implementation of this legislation, crypto trading is now acknowledged as a regulated financial activity, signifying a momentous achievement in the regulatory realm of the crypto industry. After the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), this progressive law in the UK aims to establish a robust regulatory framework that bolsters investor confidence and encourages innovation within the crypto sector. By introducing clear rules and guidelines, it fosters a secure and transparent environment for crypto-related activities, thereby attracting increased participation from investors and businesses alike.Coming to the price action, among the top 100 cryptos by market cap, here are the best and worst-performing ones over the past week:As per prices on Monday.1. Compound is up by 80%2. Bitcoin Cash is up by 53%3. eCash is up by 52%4. Flow is up by 36%5. Bitcoin SV is up by 32%1. Conflux is down by 8%2. ApeCoin is down by 8%3. NEAR Protocol is down by 7%4.

It had flagged similar concerns to Cboe related to a filing from Fidelity The digital asset space is looking to regain popularity after a bruising 2022 that saw several crypto ventures collapse, including the spectacular implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX.The SEC last month sued Coinbase for failing to register as an exchange. According to Cboe's Fidelity bitcoin ETF filing, the company's platform represented roughly half of U.S. dollar-bitcoin trading in May.Coinbase said in a letter filed last month in Manhattan federal court that it will ask a judge to toss the SEC lawsuit, arguing the regulator lacks authority to pursue civil claims because the crypto assets trading on its platform are not \"investment contracts\", and thus not securities.The SEC has rejected dozens of spot bitcoin ETF applications in recent years, including one from Fidelity in January 2022.In all the cases, it said the filings did not meet the standards designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices and protect investors and the public interest."

        "title": "How Ordinal Inscriptions Will Drive Adoption Of Bitcoin's Lightning Network - Nasdaq",
        "content": "This is an opinion editorial by Jesse Shrader, the co-founder and CEO of Amboss, a Lightning Network explorer and analytics tool.\n\nFor years, you could basically only do two things on the Bitcoin network: You could save BTC or you could spend it. Then, a late 2021 privacy upgrade had the unintended consequence of allowing data storage on the Bitcoin blockchain, resulting in NFT-like inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens, both applying Ordinal Theory for asset tracking.\n\nThe popularity of NFT-like Ordinal inscriptions and the experimental BRC-20 token standard has driven up transaction costs across the Bitcoin network. The frothy demand for \u201cstamping\u201d limited block space with new data pushed transaction costs so high that in May 2023, Binance twice had to pause BTC withdrawals, a risky and undesirable step for a global exchange. To help manage the transaction costs, Binance announced it would start using the Lightning Network \u2014 a decentralized, Layer 2 network designed for fast transactions bypassing the underlying Bitcoin blockchain\u2014 to process BTC withdrawals.\n\nWhile some argue that Bitcoin should stick to being digital gold, I don\u2019t see it that way.\n\nAs a store of value, bitcoin will continue to provide a trustless alternative to central banking; other uses of its immutable blockchain don\u2019t diminish this function. On the contrary, emergent uses of the Bitcoin blockchain will drive more efficient use of the limited block space, leading to broad adoption of Lightning Network as a scaling solution for bitcoin as a global currency. The Lightning Network\u2019s growth will provide a trustless alternative to centralized payment processors, expanding Bitcoin\u2019s utility.\n\nChallenges Faced By BRC-20 Tokens\n\nThe BRC-20 token standard is extremely new \u2014 created in March 2023. If its name sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s somewhat akin to ERC-20 tokens such as Shiba Inu and MakerDAO that run atop the Ethereum network. Whereas Bitcoin has traditionally been about storing and transmitting value, BRC-20s allow for other assets to be \u201cminted\u201d in an Ordinal inscription. Now, a slew of BRC-20s have popped up for trading and speculation, many in the form of meme tokens, from PIZA to MEME. As of June 26, 2023, the market cap for BRC-20 tokens was over $260 million, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBut all of this minting is driving bitcoin transaction costs higher. That\u2019s not necessarily bad for bitcoin miners, who earn BTC by processing transactions. CoinDesk reported in early May 2023 that some BTC miners were earning more by collecting transaction fees than they were by creating new BTC. That\u2019s quite a lot, considering each block reward currently nets miners 6.25 BTC (worth roughly $188,000 at the time of writing).\n\nAs for whether this is good for users, that\u2019s debatable. The average bitcoin transaction fee recently hit a two-year high, peaking at $30.91 on May 8, 2023, despite a bear market; those abstaining from BRC-20s are likely grumbling about increased fees. On the other hand, the introduction of the BRC-20 token standard has inspired deeper conversations about network scaling for Bitcoin.\n\nAlready Making An Impact\n\nAt the moment, BRC-20s lack some of the utility of their ERC-20 cousins. They don\u2019t, for instance, use smart contracts, and their utility is mostly the same as PFP NFTs, leading many to argue they\u2019re not worth the cost.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the demand for Bitcoin-based tokens is sustainable or whether such activity will get redirected to other, more permissive or centralized networks.\n\nIn one scenario, higher fees could force Bitcoin\u2019s traditional users away from the network. This is unlikely. Bitcoin\u2019s unchanging and conservative monetary policy remains the primary attraction; the network has no real competition in this regard as a hedge to monetary debasement.\n\nBut assuming Ordinal inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens show the same staying power as memecoins and NFTs on other networks \u2014 Shiba Inu, remember, has a market cap of $5 billion and Bored Apes are virtually a household name \u2014 they will keep driving transaction fees above their historical average.\n\nThis could have long-term impacts on Bitcoin users.\n\nIn particular, higher transaction costs create a demand for more efficient transactions. While some of this can be done at a protocol level (e.g., SegWit, the contentious 2017 upgrade to Bitcoin that enabled leaner transaction sizes by separating the signature data from the transaction data), much of it can come from scaling technologies on a second layer.\n\nEnter: the Lightning Network, which batches transactions via long-term smart contracts and uses Bitcoin\u2019s underlying security to allow fast and cheap payments.\n\nFuture Solutions\n\nLightning Network fees are extremely modest compared to on-chain counterparts. While the fees do fluctuate, the overall network fees have not increased as a result of BRC-20s or inscriptions. The network currently charges fees to reward network node operators. According to data available via Amboss\u2019 Bitcoin Lightning Network analytics platform, the median fee remains 0.002%. Compare that to traditional payment networks, which charge 2% to 3% of the payment amount every time you swipe your credit card.\n\nThe Bitcoin community is currently subsidizing the creation of the payment network, driving Lightning fees extremely low. Even with increased demand over time, sustainable fee rates for Lightning should grow to around 0.03%, based on less generous operator behavior.\n\nPrimed To Become The Default Global Payments Processor\n\nThe combination of Bitcoin monetary policy and Lightning\u2019s transaction network is a potent one. Bitcoin has long presented itself as an alternative to a broken central banking system. But through competitive uses of its unforgivingly tight blockchain, the efficiency gained through Lightning transactions is more prescient than ever.\n\nThough the Lightning Network has been years in the making, it is maturing at the perfect time \u2014 ready to enable billions of transactions across the network \u2014 and become the global de facto payment processor.\n\nThis is a guest post by Jesse Shrader.

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin miners are awash with funds from transaction fees, a multimillion-dollar windfall generated this past quarter due to the popularity of BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals, according to Coin Metrics.\n\nThe crypto analytics firm said that a formerly \u201ctepid fee market\u201d for Bitcoin miners has been suddenly upended, with its latest \u201cState of the Network\u201d report finding miners earning $184 million from transaction fees from April through June.\n\nCompared to $2.4 billion in Bitcoin mining revenue overall, that figure may sound small, but the latest transaction fee total represents more than the five preceding quarters combined, Coin Metrics said. It described the shift as \u201can exceptional change\u201d influenced by BRC-20 tokens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLaunched earlier this year, Ordinals is a protocol that enables people to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by inscribing data to an individual satoshi\u2014the smallest unit of currency that a Bitcoin can be divided into, equal to 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin.\n\nEven though Ordinals\u2019 arrival has been met with some pushback from within the Bitcoin community, its potential has been highlighted by figures like MicroStrategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, a prominent Bitcoin supporter who noted the protocol\u2019s new ability to help miners stay profitable over time.\n\nBRC-20 tokens were introduced in March, and the experimental class of coins takes inspiration from Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token standard. BRC-20 tokens have ballooned to over $240 million in market capitalization since being introduced, according to CoinGecko.\n\nIn order for people to mint BRC-20 tokens\u2014and essentially claim them from a BRC-20 project that\u2019s launched\u2014users have to submit a transaction along with a fee to have their move to mint tokens processed on Bitcoin\u2019s network and included in the next block of transactions.\n\nAs a sense of \u201cmania\u201d surrounding BRC-20 tokens took hold in May, people became more willing to pay a greater premium on transactions in exchange for speed, Nick Hansen, CEO and co-founder of Luxor Technologies, told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBRC-20s introduced this urgency because what you needed to do was get your transactions confirmed faster than other peoples\u2019 transactions,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you would basically win the coins from the mint.\u201d\n\nTransaction fees on Bitcoin were so high in May that some people claimed Bitcoin was under attack. And the amount of Bitcoin miners earned from transaction fees outpaced Bitcoin\u2019s block subsidy for the first time since 2017.\n\nCoin Metrics\u2019 report notes that payout amounts related to transaction fees have waned as the fervor surrounding BRC-20s ebbs. Still, the amount of funds that miners are receiving from transaction fees remains robust, Hansen said\u2014especially compared to years past.\n\n\u201cWe have calmed down, but we're still seeing persistent demand for Bitcoin block space,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cMiners are still making 10 to 15 times more from their transaction fee volume than they would have last year.\u201d"

        "content": "This post was first published on Medium.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the world of digital security, cryptography plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and authenticity of data. One widely used cryptographic technique is the use of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)\u00b9. PGP provides encryption and authentication for secure communication, such as email, file transfers, and data storage.\n\nPGP can use the same elliptic curve as in Bitcoin called secp256k1, thus it can be made compatible with and leveraged in Bitcoin. An existing PGP elliptic key key pair can be reused as a Bitcoin key pair, so we can:\n\nsend bitcoins to one\u2019s address derived from her PGP public key. Only she can spend the bitcoins with the PGP private key.\n\nsign messages that can be trusted to come from a PGP user.\n\nIn this article, we will dive into the example of a trusted oracle generating a PGP signature using the secp256k1 elliptic curve, which is verified and used on-chain using sCrypt.\n\nGenerate a PGP signature\n\nThe first step is to make sure your machine has GnuPG installed. It\u2019s a very widely used program and you probably already have it on your system.\n\nGenerate a private key\n\nRun the following command:\n\ngpg \u2013full-gen-key \u2013expert\n\nThis will run an interactive prompt for generating your key. When it asks you to select that you want a ECC key for signing, using \u201csecp256k1\u201d as the curve.\n\nOnce done you will have a new key stored on your system. To list all the keys, run this:\n\ngpg \u2013list-keys \u2013with-fingerprint\n\nCreate a signature\n\nBecause the signature we will verify in Bitcoin needs to be in its raw form (r, s), we have prepared a tool that extracts this data from files generated by GnuPG. Clone it from GitHub with the following command:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/sCrypt-Inc/parse-pgp-sig && cd parse-pgp-sig\n\nThis tool is a fork of the original, written by Mark Blundeberg.\n\nNow, let\u2019s sign a message that is stored inside the \u201ctestmsg\u201d file. First, edit the key ID in \u201cmakesig.sh\u201d to use the ID of the key you\u2019ve created in the previous step. Then run the following:\n\n./makesig.sh\n\nThis will create a file named \u201ctestmsg.sig\u201d, which contains the signature. Because we also need our public key, we must export it like:\n\ngpg \u2013output pubkey.gpg \u2013export <KEY_ID>\n\nLastly, run the following:\n\n./parsesig.py\n\nThis will print all the data needed in the right format, to be used for verification. The output should look something like the following:\n\npubkey.gpg loaded, key ID AF73C8F7B546F94B39317588BC4509E6210D4B78 Public key point coordinates: x = 48421684640566418104679532805542050894296452248858999768503364580534732096841 y = 27832515582888013475460648727797934257300201948678282835754427898215825506626 Message: b 'Hello world!\n\n' Message hex: 48656c6c6f20776f726c64210a04001308001d162104af73c8f7b546f94b39317588bc4509e6210d4b7805026453693704ff00000023 Sig: r: 64359296802826103123327210017080540130282890114880640962625134547151700407256 s: 8795100933587794005356181940782496292717652651227485898667966611241902738847 Signature validity on message: True\n\n\n\nVerify the signature in Bitcoin\n\nHere\u2019s a simple sCrypt smart contract, which can verify the signature we just created.\n\nAs we can observe, the deployed contract stores the raw message as a contract property.

        "content": "Following an impressive upward surge in recent days, the price of Bitcoin is presently stabilizing above the significant psychological threshold of $30,000, thus establishing robust support. This consolidation period is occurring below the most recent peak for this year, which reached an annual high of $31,422.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has displayed a notable price trajectory that appears to resemble a well-known technical analysis pattern known as a \u201cbull flag\u201d or a \u201cpole and Flag\u201d on the daily price chart. This pattern, known for signaling a potential continuation of an upward trend, suggests the possibility of an upcoming rally in the near future.\n\nAs of the current moment, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed the $31,000 threshold and is currently positioned at $31,060. However, buyers are encountering difficulties as they contend with the significant resistance observed at $31,500.\n\nOn the daily price chart, Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price remains comfortably distant from the 200-day simple moving average, indicating a robust level of support in the event of a price retracement.\n\nThe daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is gradually approaching the overbought territory, signaling a potential upswing in Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) growth trajectory.\n\nThe bullish breakout of this bulls pattern could lead the further price rally toward the next resistance level of $35,000."

        "content": "A report retrieved from Wu Blockchain has shown that Bitcoin was the best-performing asset in the first six months of the year. The flagship digital asset rose over 80% to close above $30,000 last Friday, outmatching other major global assets like NASDAQ, British Pound, Euro, Japanese Yen, NYMEX Natural Gas and other stocks in the process.\n\nRecall that Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory for 2023 has been with a bullish undertone. It commenced the year with a strong bullish sentiment and the price rose by 47% within the first month of the year, setting the tone for the following weeks.\n\nThe rise of the flagship cryptocurrency was characterised by typical declines, with support and resistance levels impacting the price change. Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped to $19,569 in March after climbing over $25,000 for the first time since August 2022. Many analysts identified the climb above $25,000 as a significant move to confirm the end of the bear market.\n\nAnother phase of the bullish trend returned to the Bitcoin market in the middle of June. The digital asset gained over 58% in about four weeks during that period, as the price surpassed the $30,000 level for the first time since June 2022.\n\nRead also:\n\nBitcoin crosses $28,000 for the first time since May; what is behind this surge?\n\nData shows that Bitcoin\u2019s price at the end of June was $30,469, marking a yearly gain of over 83%. Now, the majority of the digital asset\u2019s proponents consider this time a consolidation and accumulation opportunity with the anticipation of a bull run ahead of the next Bitcoin halving, which comes up in 2024.\n\nHow Bitcoin outpaced other major assets in H1 2023\n\nData from renowned crypto reporter Wu Blockchain shows that Bitcoin\u2019s value increased by 83.8% in the first half of 2023, ranking first and exceeding other major world assets by a significant margin.\n\nIn the second position is the Nasdaq index, whose value increased by 31.7%. Followed by Nikkei225 Index (27.19%), Germany DAX Index (15.98%), Euro Stoxx 50 Index (15.96%), S&P 500 Index (15.91%) respectively.\n\nA 37% drop in value puts natural gas in the bottom position following the fall in the prices of other energy sources.\n\nAlso, a Market Watch report says crypto-related exchange-traded funds skyrocketed in the first half of 2023, outperforming other United States-listed ETFs. In a phone interview with the Finance media, Aniket Ullal, head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA, confirmed that the top 15 ETFs in terms of performance this year have exposure to crypto or blockchain.\n\nHow Bitcoin was able to outperform other assets\n\nIn the first half of the year, the crypto market dealt with the effect of the FTX collapse and last year\u2019s collapse of several crypto-related firms. However, the space soon shrugged those concerns off as the industry witnessed renewed institutional demand.\n\nOn June 15, BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world with around $10 trillion worth of assets under management, applied for a Bitcoin spot ETF. This move triggered other institutions like Fidelity and others to file a similar application for a spot ETF.\n\nAmid these events, BTC\u2019s price nearly doubled from around $16,000 to above $31,000, outperforming other earlier mentioned significant assets like gold, S&P 500, Nikkei 225 index, and others.\n\nAlso, the first half of 2023 has witnessed the emergence of Ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain network. The Ordinals Inscriptions are similar to NFTs as it allows the inscriptions of text, audio, and images into the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin, Satoshi.\n\nAt the peak of its craze, Ordinals pushed Bitcoin\u2019s average daily transactions to a record high, leading to higher network fees. This is demonstrative of the huge effect the innovation has had on Bitcoin.\n\nWhat is next?\n\nExperts have predicted that despite the SEC\u2019s recent lawsuits, the crypto market will continue to push that aside and soar amidst renewed institutional investors\u2019 interest.\n\nRead also:\n\n3 cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin to consider buying this July\n\nAs BTC continues to dominate the charts and media headlines, the flurry of Bitcoin ETF applications will propel more crypto whales into buying, thereby improving the general sentiment in the market."

        "content": "Last northern hemisphere summer, a flurry of public crypto-mining companies sold large amounts of their coin reserves amid a Texas heat wave in the US that forced a drop in production and a number of crypto industry meltdowns. Some of the miners have been running with thin margins, Harper said. But more heat waves and bitcoin\u2019s preprogrammed event, the \u201chalving\u201d, are likely to further compress the margins.\n\nThe miners in Texas shut off their mining machines amid record power demand last month. The Lone Star state, which has become a crypto-mining hub thanks to its cheap energy and business-friendly regulations, has seen power cost surging.\n\nWhile some of the miners are able to hedge against the rising prices by purchasing power in advance and reselling it back to the grid with a premium, others have to unplug their energy-intensive operations without any compensation.\n\nThe curtailment has already been reflected on the mining difficulty, which is a measure of computing power to mine bitcoin. The bi-weekly figure had been on a steady rise and hit an all-time-high in mid June but it saw a 3.3 per cent decrease in the latest cycle, according to data from btc.com.\n\nBitcoin miners are also in a race to survive the next halving in 2024. The update cuts mining rewards, the new tokens issued to compensate miners\u2019 work that validate transaction data on the network, in half every four years until the token reaches its 21 million cap in about 2140. Mining rewards, which is the main source of revenue for miners, will be down from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin for a miner that successfully processes a certain amount of data.\n\nFollowing the halving, if some miners\u2019 cash flow turns negative, they may have to further finance their operations with cash stowed on their balance sheet, said Matthew Kimmell, digital asset analyst at asset management and research firm CoinShares.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe flow data tracking transactions between miners and exchanges is one of the best proxies for sales of mined coins, but it has limitations. The miners that send their tokens to exchanges may not eventually sell them and the flow data does not include all miners and exchanges.\n\nBloomberg\n\n\n\nBloomberg"

        "title": "How to Make Money When Bitcoin Plunges - Money.ca",
        "content": "In this article\n\nSix ways to make money when Bitcoin is downtrending\n\nThere are more ways to make money on Bitcoin than taking a long position and simply holding on. Whether you want to take advantage of short-term price changes, spend your Bitcoin when it\u2019s no longer earning money, or even bet against Bitcoin, there are plenty of opportunities for investors to take advantage of cryptocurrency price movements. Here are some ways to make money in Bitcoin when the price is going down.\n\n1. Buy the dip\n\nOne of the best ways to make money when Bitcoin\u2019s price is down is to buy more of it. While it can feel emotionally and psychologically painful to see your account balances tumble when the price of cryptocurrency takes a dive, it\u2019s actually a great buying opportunity for new investments. After all, buying Bitcoin after a price correction is better than buying it at its all-time highs!\n\nI recommend allocating a fixed percentage of your total investment portfolio to cryptocurrency, somewhere between 1% to 5% is a safe bet. When the price of Bitcoin drops, you\u2019ll likely fall below your target investment allocation. You can buy more until you are back at your target again. When the price of Bitcoin recovers, you can sell off some of your profits to keep your portfolio in balance.\n\nI\u2019ve been investing 1% to 3% of my portfolio in Bitcoin since 2017 and sticking to this target allocation has let me take advantage of dips and cashout on profits at Bitcoin\u2019s highs. It\u2019s helped me manage big swings in Bitcoin\u2019s price by always keeping my exposure to cryptocurrency in line with my goals.\n\n2. Sell Bitcoin using limit orders\n\nMost people think they are at the mercy of the market price of Bitcoin if they want to sell their cryptocurrency, but you can choose your own price that you feel comfortable letting your coins go for.\n\nLimit orders allow you to sell a financial security only if it reaches a certain price during a specified time period. Many experienced investors use limit orders to trade in the stock market, but now limit orders are available on many cryptocurrency exchange platforms too! Because cryptocurrency trades around the world and around the clock, the best prices to execute a sale can happen at a time you\u2019re not available to make a trade, like in the middle of the night. Setting a limit order ensures your Bitcoin will be sold even if you\u2019re not logged in to press \u201csell.\u201d\n\nTo set a sell limit order for Bitcoin, you choose a price higher than the current market price and a time period. Because cryptocurrency markets are open 24/7, you will choose a specific date for your limit order to expire. Typically people set their limit orders to expire in 24hrs, 48hrs, 7 days or 30 days, but your cryptocurrency platform may offer additional options. Your Bitcoin will only be sold if the price reaches the limit order price you set before the order expires.\n\nWhen using limit orders, your trade will be executed automatically so make sure you\u2019re comfortable with the price you choose. If the price of Bitcoin continues to rise higher than the price you selected, you will miss out on those gains because your coins will have already been sold.\n\n3. Swing trade Bitcoin\n\nCryptocurrency is exceptionally volatile, and you should expect double-digit price jumps. Instead of being scared of volatility, you can use it to your advantage with swing trades. Swing trading is the practice of making short-term bets on price movements of a financial security. Instead of buying and holding for the long term, you may only hold a financial security for a few months or a few days, or even a few hours before selling.\n\nBecause Bitcoin\u2019s price is so volatile, it can be great for swing trading. Double-digit price jumps in a few hours or over the course of a day are normal, which is a huge opportunity to profit from swing trades. However, you need to be paying attention to the markets and have a good amount of Bitcoin on hand to make it work.\n\nMake sure to transfer the Bitcoin you\u2019ll be trading to your cryptocurrency exchange platform so you\u2019re ready to take advantage of large price movements. You can set limit orders to execute trades automatically when Bitcoin hits your price targets, or you can simply set alerts on your phone to notify you when Bitcoin hits a certain price or moves by a certain amount. Many cryptocurrency exchange platforms already email their user base when whenever Bitcoin\u2019s percentage price change is in the double digits.\n\nBefore you start swing trading, make a trading plan that includes your entry and exit price targets for Bitcoin. You need to stick to this trading plan to avoid making emotional decisions in response to Bitcoin\u2019s price movements. Swing trading only works if you\u2019re making rational, math-based decisions. It\u2019s likely your intuition will be telling you to do the opposite of what your spreadsheet does, so you need to be exceptionally disciplined to execute your planned trades no matter what Bitcoin\u2019s price is doing.\n\n4. Buy an inverse Bitcoin ETF\n\nOne of the easiest ways to hedge against downturns in Bitcoin\u2019s price is to purchase shares of an inverse Bitcoin ETF. Horizons launched the BetaPro Inverse Bitcoin ETF in April 2021, which trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker BITI.TO. It is available in both Canadian and US dollars.\n\nThis ETF moves in the opposite direction of Bitcoin. It trades at -1X Bitcoin\u2019s price, which means if the price of Bitcoin decreases by 10%, the share price of the BITI.TO ETF will increase by 10%. Likewise, if the trend reverses and the price of Bitcoin starts to go up, the value of the inverse Bitcoin ETF shares will go down proportionally.\n\nInverse ETFs make it easy to place a bet against a security, without the hassle of having to do a short Bitcoin sale. If you\u2019re bearish on Bitcoin, want to hedge your long position in Bitcoin, or you simply want to turn a profit in Bitcoin\u2019s down market cycles, an inverse Bitcoin ETF is the simplest way to do so.\n\nTo buy shares of an Inverse Bitcoin ETF, you need to have a brokerage account that allows you to access the stock market. Both Questrade and Wealthsimple are excellent choices for discount brokerages because purchasing shares of the ETF will be free on either platform. Wealthsimple offers no-commission trading, making it ideal for new investors who are just getting started in the stock market or active traders who will be making plenty of buy and sell trades. Questrade offers no trading commissions when you buy ETFs, but will charge fees to sell shares of an ETF. Depending on how active you expect your trading to be will determine which platform is best for you!\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to invest both directly in Bitcoin and an inverse Bitcoin ETF, make sure you make your investments in a way that doesn\u2019t cancel each other out. You\u2019re trying to profit off of Bitcoin\u2019s price movements in either direction, which means you want to own Bitcoin when the price of Bitcoin is going up and the inverse ETF when the price of Bitcoin is going down. If you hold both at the same time in the same amounts, they will cancel each other out and both your profits and losses in Bitcoin will be 0%.\n\n5. Lend your Bitcoin\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to sell your Bitcoin or buy more, there is one way to make money on it: lend it out. Cryptocurrency lender platforms are gaining popularity because they give long-term Bitcoin holders an opportunity to earn passive income on their cryptocurrency. When you lend out your Bitcoin, you will earn interest on the balance borrowed. Usually, the interest is paid out as more Bitcoin. The transaction is facilitated by a cryptocurrency lending platform, which reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of non-repayment from the borrower.\n\nLending out your Bitcoin is a great way to turn your cryptocurrency into a passive income source, but the payout is generally small and takes a long time to accumulate. Expect to receive quarterly or even annual payments for the amount borrowed, and in the meantime, your Bitcoin is tied up so you cannot sell or trade it elsewhere.\n\n6. Invest in other cryptocurrencies\n\nAn easy way to invest in cryptocurrency even when Bitcoin\u2019s price is decreasing is to choose another coin. Ether has shown better price recovery than Bitcoin after this most recent correction and has more to offer in the long term. If you\u2019re looking to invest in cryptocurrency as both a financial asset and future technology, altcoins are the answer.\n\nLesser-known altcoins like Dash, Litecoin, Ripple, or Tether have more potential for growth but are also likely to be even more volatile than Bitcoin. If you\u2019re underwhelmed with your returns in Bitcoin, Ether or another altcoin might be exactly what you\u2019re looking for. However, if the recent dip in Bitcoin\u2019s price is what is pushing you to sell, you might want to stay away from other cryptos!\n\nShould I sell my Bitcoin if the price is decreasing?\n\nWhether or not you should sell your Bitcoin when the price is decreasing depends more on your personal financial situation, investment goals, and long-term perspective on Bitcoin. Long-term investors should largely ignore volatility in Bitcoin\u2019s price unless they are using it to find buying opportunities to increase their position. Short-term investors need to weigh the costs and benefits of selling their Bitcoin now against doing so in the future.\n\nWhen to hold and when to let go\n\nWhether you keep your Bitcoin or sell it off really depends on what type of investor you are. If you need the cash you have invested in Bitcoin for something else more important, then it\u2019s always appropriate to sell your cryptocurrency to use your money where it will work best for you. Likewise, if you\u2019ve made your profits from an earlier investment in Bitcoin, it\u2019s always good to cash out and claim your winnings!\n\nThat said, if you\u2019re bullish on the technology and potential of cryptocurrency in the long term, there is no reason to exit your position now. Cryptocurrency is a highly volatile asset and you should expect huge price fluctuations. You need to train yourself not to be scared of dramatic price movements, and often the best way to do that is to go through them without making any rash decisions!\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes you can make when investing is selling too soon, and another is trading too often. It takes discipline and practice to wait out volatility, but with an asset like crypto, it\u2019s often the best course of action. Bitcoin is here to stay, and if you make it part of your portfolio you can choose how you want to make your profit!\n\nRecommended reads:"

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market seems to be carrying a bullish sentiment, as Bitcoin (BTC) price crossed the $31,000 price mark. As of July 4, 2023 (11.11 am, Indian Standard Time), CoinMarketCap, a crypto price-tracking website, mentioned BTC\u2019s price to be $31,064.46, at around $603 billion worth market capitalisation. \u201cI believe the market looks bullish. There is believed to be institutional interests and regulatory clarity across governments. The sentiment on crypto twitter seems happy and positive after a long time,\u201d Dheeraj Shah, a Web3.0 content creator, told FE Blockchain.\n\nCoinMarketCap further stated that BTC price witnessed a nearly 1.10% increase on a 24 hour basis, and close to 2.40% rise based on the last seven days. It\u2019s believed that institutional impact on BTC seems to be contributing towards this upward trend. As per CoinDCX, a crypto investment application, BlackRock, Invesco and WisdomTree entering the BTC ETF landscape has been attributed with BTC\u2019s rising price levels, on account of increase in institutional investors around digital assets. The application also highlighted that interest rate calls can influence BTC\u2019s price, as Federal Reserve reportedly aims to go for high interest rates.\n\nImage credit: CoinMarketCap\n\n\u201cI believe factors contributing to BTC include stabilisation of interest rates which helps in money flow. Easing interest rates can make credit cheaper to allow participants to invest using debt. Institutions filing for BTC ETFs could also be another factor as this shows that crypto is becoming mainstream,\u201d Rahul Pagidipati, CEO, ZebPay, a cryptocurrency exchange, stated.\n\nEver since BlackRock, followed by Invesco and WisdomTree, took the decision to invest in BTC ETFs, it\u2019s been found that BTC\u2019s price hasn\u2019t dropped below the $25,000 level. As stated by Investing.com, a financial markets platform, from June 15, 2023, onwards, which\u2019s when BlackRock entered the BTC ETF market followed by Invesco and WisdomTree on June 21, 2023, BTC clocked the highest value of $31,151.30 (July 3, 2023) and lowest value of $25,591.30 (June 15, 2023). Upon calculating the average BTC price based on Investing.com\u2019s data, for June 15 to July 3, 2023, it stood at approximately $29,260.\n\nImage credit: Investing.com\n\nAccording to data from CoinCodex, a cryptocurrency data website, Bitcoin\u2019s 200-day simple moving average (SMA) should witness an upward trend to $26,776 within August 2, 2023, and will clock a $30,438 price with regard to 50-day SMA by the same date. Moreover, future predictions indicate that by 2023 end, BTC can cross the $35,000 price level. Further research, based on the website\u2019s data, suggests that Bitcoin will be around the $38,000 price range by 2023 end. Overall, indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum oscillator expects Bitcoin price to have an upward trend, as the RSI value is 71.10 which signifies BTC market is in an overbought situation.\n\n\u201cBitcoin broke the ceiling of descending trend channel in medium term. This suggests a slower rate of decline or the beginning of a horizontal development. Especially for large stocks, a high RSI can be a sign that the stock is overbought and there is a chance for a downward reaction,\u201d Sathvik Vishwanath, co-founder and CEO, Unocoin, a cryptocurrency exchange, concluded.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"

        "title": "On-chain analysis on Bitcoin mining activities - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "In this article we take a look at on-chain data for Bitcoin: new coins minted from mining activities are headed to exchanges giving bearish signals for the cryptocurrency.\n\nMeanwhile, some metrics tell us that investors are not capitulating their positions because they expect a higher future price for BTC.\n\nThe king of the market is hovering around the key $30,000 level waiting to make the next move. Will this be upward or downward?\n\nSee all the details below.\n\nBitcoin mining: a look at on-chain data\n\nBearish signals on the mining front are on the horizon for Bitcoin, which for the past 13 days has been hovering somewhat quietly around the psychological $30,000 threshold while giving some positive hints about future price action.\n\nMost notably, the \u201cadjusted SOPR\u201d metric, which provides interesting data regarding the profitability/loss of on-chain moved BTC, anticipates a bullish overall picture for us.\n\nThis indicator calculates the ratio of the price at which a coin was last moved to its initial purchase price, without taking into account internal movements between multiple wallets of the same individual.\n\nThe adjusted SOPR generally ranges between the value of 1.3 and 0.7: when this is above the 1 level it means that traders are selling their coins making profits, while when it is below 1 the sales are to be considered losses.\n\nTheoretically, when the market is bullish, investors tend to avoid liquidating their positions at a loss, precisely because they expect future price rises: inversely these prefer to accept losses and exit the market when scenarios turn bearish.\n\nRight now the indicator has remained slightly above 1 for about two weeks, stating that few are selling at a loss and at the same time no large profits are being made.\n\nThis is typical of situations that anticipate an impending bull market, which could push the price of Bitcoin in the direction of $40,000 and beyond in the short term.\n\nThere will be caution to be taken if the adjusted SOPR reaches extreme values close to 1.3, which indicates an exaggeration of profits and euphoria out of the ordinary.\n\nVery important to remember that we are in a historical period when liquidity and volumes on exchanges are at multi-year lows, so this phase can be seen as a consolidation before an imminent decisive price movement, with odds going for the upside.\n\nBitcoin mining: record coin flows to exchanges\n\nWhile some on-chain data are rooting for a return to Bitcoin\u2019s bull market, on the mining front the data do not seem to be so optimistic, at least at first glance.\n\nAs of 15 June, a huge amount of BTC in the hands of miners was being moved to cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nThis is abnormal given that such an intense and prolonged flow has not been seen in the past 3 years of on-chain movements.\n\nOn average, about 3,000 BTC per day have been moved, alarming analysts of a possible capitulation taking place.\n\nIndeed, exchanges represent the ideal place where miners profit from their activity by converting the proceeds into FIAT money.\n\nSo, this situation could cause negative sentiment.\n\nSupporting the large flow of new Bitcoin minted by mining activity in the direction of exchanges is another metric called the \u201cMiners\u2019 Position Index.\u201d\n\nThis gives us details on the regularity of sales by miners, who must by necessity cash some of their BTC in order to pay back operating expenses such as electricity and new hardware.\n\nWhen there are above-average flows to exchanges however, this could be a sign of an impending bear market.\n\nIn recent days the Miners Position Index has been well above the \u201c2\u201d level stating that miners have been moving more than usual.\n\nRight now the flows seem to have subsided, giving a sigh of relief for Bitcoin, which is currently not giving up an inch and remains firmly above $30,000.\n\nAlthough these data are bearish, typical of bear markets, they could sometimes be interpreted differently.\n\nOn exchanges, besides being simply sold, BTC can also be put as collateral to open positions in derivative markets, which would rule out large ongoing sales and instead favor a picture familiar to early bull market phases\n\nAccording to data from CryptoQuant, as of 15 June, some 33,860 BTC had been routed to exchange derivatives markets\n\nAt the same time, miners\u2019 reserves fell by about 8,000 BTC, so the missing coins were likely used to hedge their positions or speculate on a momentary rise in the cryptocurrency price.\n\nThis kind of behavior on the part of those engaged in Bitcoin mining correlated with positive market price action is completely anomalous.\n\nWhat is more likely is that the huge flow of coins to the exchanges had very little impact on price movement and that there were no big sales.\n\nEnergy sustainability of mining at the highest level\n\nAs the issues surrounding the movement of coins from mining activities become increasingly complex, Bitcoin is becoming more and more sustainable in the stages of its production.\n\nIn fact, compared to other industries, the mining industry is becoming increasingly sustainable, with 52.6% use of renewable energy.\n\nIn particular, it is interesting to note that the mix of sustainable energy has increased by 38% since July 2019, which ranks the business first in energy transition to clean sources, behind only banking.\n\nAlthough common narratives tend to portray Bitcoin mining as environmentally deleterious, the reality of the facts is quite different.\n\nBlock production and validation by miners indirectly incentivizes massive use of renewable energy, which is also the least expensive energy source, and therefore the one preferred by this industry, in line with the concept of game theory.\n\nIn addition, as time goes on, the world finds new ways to intelligently use the hardware typical of mining.\n\nIn the Netherlands for example, a farm owner had the ingenious idea of harnessing the heat given off by ASICs, machinery used in the Bitcoin mining process, to keep the temperature of his crop constant.\n\nNEW: \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1 Farm in the Netherlands uses Bitcoin mining to keep the temperatures stable in the greenhouse \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/sXpk3uO8ya \u2014 Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) June 30, 2023\n\nSince Elon Musk warned the Bitcoin community about the danger of Bitcoin\u2019s energy impact, improvements have been seen on all fronts.\n\nMiners now prefer renewable sources to conduct their business, both because it suits them economically and because they fear being punished by regulators for violating ESG criteria.\n\nIn addition to a spread of best practices in terms of mining, there is a growing culture of respect for the environment and the importance of considering the impact that any activity can have on society at its base.\n\nEven in Germany, a local TV station is talking about the \u201cbenefits\u201d to the environment triggered by these activities."

        "content": "With Bitcoin (BTC) surpassing the $31,000 mark and maintaining its position above $30,000, cryptocurrency traders and investors are eagerly observing whether the primary digital asset can sustain its upward trajectory and potentially set its sights on $40,000.\n\nThe recent surge in the number of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) filings and the growing interest from major institutions have significantly influenced investor sentiment toward the cryptocurrency in recent weeks.\n\nAmidst the uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s future movement in the upcoming weeks, Finbold sought insights from PricePredictions, a platform renowned for its employment of advanced machine learning algorithms. These algorithms closely assess the dynamic market conditions and analyze pertinent indicators to gauge the probability of Bitcoin\u2019s continued success by the end of July.\n\nIntriguingly, the algorithms project that BTC will climb to $33,329 by the end of the month, representing a 7% increase from the current price of the asset at the time of publication.\n\nBTC price prediction for July 31. Source: PricePredictions\n\nThe estimate is based on a wide range of technical indicators, such as moving average convergence divergence (MACD), relative strength index (RSI), Bollinger Bands (BB), and more.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nOver the past year, Bitcoin has experienced an impressive surge, witnessing a substantial 59% increase in price. This growth means BTC has outperformed 84% of the top 100 crypto assets.\n\nFurthermore, the flagship digital asset is currently trading above the 200-day simple moving average, suggesting a positive trend that has caught the attention of seasoned investors.\n\nAs it continues to maintain a strong market position, Bitcoin finds itself trading near its cycle high, further solidifying its standing as a cryptocurrency to watch closely in the fast-paced and ever-changing crypto landscape, with 17 green days in the last 30 days.\n\nAs things stand, BTC is changing hands at $31,022, up 1.22% on the day. Renowned crypto trading expert, Michael van de Poppe, shared his insights on July 4 regarding the current state of Bitcoin. According to van de Poppe, he noted that the true acceleration for Bitcoin would take place once it surpasses the $32,500 mark.\n\nBTC price acceleration.
