        "content": "It's no reason why so many call proof-of-stake a plutocracy. Money talks. With Coinbase holding 11.5% of all staked ether (ETH), it effectively has a 11.5% say on what happens to the network. Imagine if a single company had 11.5% of the votes on what the Federal Reserve should do (not to suggest that the Fed is democratic). You might say you trust Brian Armstrong more than Biden. And might even describe the U.S. economy as a plutocracy. But at least the U.S. rule by elites is informal, not enshrined as the official voting mechanism like Ethereum did."

        "title": "3 Reasons Every Investor Should Own at Least a Little Bitcoin - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In a financial and political landscape filled with uncertainties, one asset has emerged as a beacon of hope for investors seeking a truly decentralized and resilient asset: Bitcoin (BTC 0.43%). With its unique attributes and growing acceptance, the cryptocurrency is proving that it deserves a spot in every investor's portfolio.\n\nWhile the amount of exposure will vary by individual preferences, evidence is mounting that some sort of allocation of the world's most valuable cryptocurrency is not a luxury but becoming more of a necessity. Here are three reasons every investor should seriously consider owning some Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio.\n\n1. Economic sovereignty through decentralization\n\nOne of Bitcoin's most compelling features lies in its decentralization, free from any governmental policies or interference. Unlike traditional fiat currencies subject to inflation and manipulation by central banks, the digital coin operates independently across thousands of nodes spread out around the globe.\n\nUnlike other cryptocurrencies and especially fiat currencies, there is no single entity with control of the network. This means that Bitcoin's sound monetary policy is virtually impossible to change and provides investors with confidence that it will continue to run just as it has since it was created in 2009.\n\nInvestors who hold it can preserve value outside of the existing financial system, which has its strings pulled by governments. Bailing out banks, providing stimulus checks to citizens, and financing ever-growing debt provide benefits in the short term. But these policies are enacted without the consent of individuals, ultimately eroding the purchasing power of their hard-earned money. Bitcoin provides an alternative.\n\n2. Inherent scarcity and diminishing supply growth\n\nBesides decentralization, Bitcoin has another compelling aspect that sets it apart from traditional fiat currencies: its scarcity and the diminishing rate of supply growth. Unlike fiat currencies, which face constant inflationary pressures and have an unlimited supply, Bitcoin's supply is strictly limited to 21 million coins.\n\nFurthermore, the mechanism of halvings, a process hardwired into its code, ensures that fewer and fewer bitcoins enter circulation approximately every four years.\n\nToday, Bitcoin's supply growth rate stands at roughly 1.75%. And come April 2024, the next halving event will slash this rate to less than 1%; about four years after that, it will be cut in half again. This process will continue until 2140, when the last bitcoin is mined.\n\nThe remarkable aspect of this is the certainty and transparency surrounding this process, as Bitcoin's open-source code allows anyone to peer into its inner workings and functionality. In stark contrast, fiat currencies lack this level of certainty or transparency, leaving people vulnerable to the unpredictable consequences of inflation and weak monetary policy.\n\nAs the antithesis to fiat currencies, Bitcoin brings a sense of stability and predictability. Investors and users can rest assured that the supply will never exceed the predetermined limit of 21 million, and the scheduled halving events ensure a gradual reduction in its supply growth rate.\n\n3. Growing institutional adoption and recognition\n\nIt might seem like the chance to capitalize on Bitcoin has passed, considering its appreciation of more than 12,000% in the past 10 years, but in fact there might not be a better time.\n\nBitcoin's unique characteristics are slowly becoming recognized by people around the world, and more recently by large institutional players. While its initial rise was attributed to common retail investors, the entrance of institutional participants is further legitimizing the asset and could add unprecedented demand to the limited supply.\n\nLeading companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy pioneered the concept of holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets in 2021. But today, this trend has evolved even further as industry leaders such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco are exploring the introduction of the crypto to the stock market.\n\nThese firms plan to introduce spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, hoping to provide a product that can be traded on the stock market. That will help democratize access and enable millions of people to add itBitcoin to 401(k) plans, pension funds, and other traditional investment portfolios, potentially creating unprecedented demand for the scarce supply.\n\nThe opportunity at hand\n\nDespite showing signs of diminishing volatility, Bitcoin remains one of the more volatile assets available today, and this should be accounted for by investors based on their risk tolerance. Although this can be helpful in bull markets as its price grows exponentially, in bear markets it could prove to be problematic for those looking to control risk.\n\nHowever, aside from its volatility, Bitcoin's unique qualities could be beneficial to those with more appetite for risk. As recognition of these qualities continues to grow and deep-pocketed institutions pile in, a potentially lucrative opportunity presents itself. In doing so, investors can reclaim their economic sovereignty and benefit from evolving dynamics around supply and demand."

        "title": "What would you do if a hacker stole all your bitcoin? - Blockworks",
        "content": "It\u2019s the heat of a bitcoin bull market and you\u2019ve just been phished for all your crypto.\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like Colorado resident Andrew Schober, you\u2019d turn to Reddit.\n\nBack in 2018, Schober unknowingly downloaded a compromised iteration of the Electrum bitcoin wallet he\u2019d found on the /r/BitcoinAirdrops subreddit.\n\nBuried inside the phony wallet was malware: a clipboard hijacker designed specifically to phish bitcoin.\n\nThe malware would take any outbound Bitcoin address on Schober\u2019s machine and mimic it, replacing the intended recipient address with one controlled by the hacker.\n\nSchober, who\u2019d been slowly acquiring bitcoin since 2014, ended up losing 16.5 BTC ($487,000) sent via the dodgy software \u2014 95% of his net worth.\n\nThe bitcoin was valued at $180,000 when he was phished, but $1.1 million at bitcoin\u2019s all-time high in 2021. Schober considered it \u201clife-changing money.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came across a link to the malware on Reddit and installed it on my PC and realized pretty quickly that it wasn\u2019t doing what it was advertised to do,\u201d Schober told Blockworks. \u201cSo I just deleted it off my PC and didn\u2019t think about it anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately, once that Trojan is installed on your hard drive, deleting the original source program doesn\u2019t get rid of the Trojan. So from that point forward, it was monitoring my hard drive for any time I copied a Bitcoin address.\u201d\n\nThe malware was pre-coded with 195,112 different BTC addresses. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just change the Bitcoin address to some random new address,\u201d Schober explained. \u201cIt matches the first few characters of the address you copied. So it looks pretty visually similar and if you\u2019re not really paying attention, you won\u2019t catch the difference and that\u2019s what happened to me.\u201d\n\nFour of those addresses ended up receiving BTC from unknowing victims around the time of Schober\u2019s attack, which considerably narrowed his scope.\n\nTracing stolen bitcoin through Monero\n\nThe beauty of the blockchain is in its open ledger. Almost all crypto transactions leave breadcrumbs that form a digital paper trail.\n\nMost often, following that trail involves stepping through transfers to track where coins end up. But for anonymity-focused Monero, secondary data such as IP addresses, social media activity and even protected crypto exchange data helps link transactions beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn Schober\u2019s case, he\u2019d traced bitcoin that had been stolen by the same malware to ShapeShift, the long-serving platform for atomically swapping between cryptocurrencies.\n\nShapeShift, for a time, maintained an API that shared addresses involved in its swaps. The API data showed Schober\u2019s attacker had swapped BTC for XMR, as well as the addresses used.\n\nSo, Schober posted on Reddit, asking if it were possible to trace Monero transactions. Nick Bax, an on-chain investigator and asset recovery specialist, answered the call.\n\n\u201cHe got like five replies that were like: \u2018No, that\u2019s impossible.\u2019 I sent him a direct message that said: \u2018This is really hard to do. But I\u2019ve done it before. And I know one lawyer who managed to get funds recovered once,\u2019\u201d Bax told Blockworks.\n\nBax ended up submitting on-chain evidence identifying the hacker as part of Schober\u2019s lawsuit filed in May 2021 \u2014 more than two years ago. Part of that process involved analyzing Monero transactions to determine, with high confidence, the provenance of XMR featured in attempts to launder Schober\u2019s stolen BTC.\n\nShapeShift\u2019s API made tracking the stolen BTC a cinch | Source: Nick Bax\n\nHe coded the Monero-tracing software himself. \u201cYou flag an output [strings that instruct the Monero blockchain where to direct transactions] and look for every transaction that could possibly have spent that flagged output. When you do that, patterns start to emerge.\u201d\n\nThis method of cracking Monero ring signatures \u2014 now known as an Eve-Alice-Eve (EAE) attack \u2014 popped up in the fallout of the prolific North Korea-fueled ransomware campaign WannaCry that started in 2017.\n\n\u201cMonero\u2019s RingCT\u2026hides the exact UTXO being spent, but does provide blockchain analysts with a list of plausible \u2018ring members,\u2019 one of which is being spent and the remainder of which are \u2018decoys,\u2019\u201d Bax wrote in a blog unpacking his investigation.\n\nA now-patched bug in Monero may have made separating real UTXOs from the decoys \u2014 and thus tracing the transactions \u2014 easier at the time.\n\nA brilliant idea: Subpoena the FBI\n\nBax determined that Schober\u2019s alleged hacker had converted some BTC stolen from another victim to XMR through ShapeShift, before sending it back through the protocol to transform it into BTC once more.\n\nThe washed BTC was directed to what\u2019s known as a \u201cvanity address\u201d that started with \u201c1BeNEdict.\u201d\n\nAs for Schober\u2019s bitcoin, that ended up on Bitfinex. Crypto exchange hot wallets are effectively black boxes, as their balances represent pooled customer funds.\n\nOnce crypto goes into a hot wallet, it\u2019s almost impossible to determine where they\u2019re withdrawn to unless the amounts are identical and uncommon \u2014 and even that proof is not definitive.\n\nThat\u2019s where Schober and Bax\u2019s investigation sat for more than a year. Stuck. Schober had subpoenaed Bitfinex to disclose the owner of the accounts which received the pilfered BTC, but he was stonewalled.\n\n\u201cBitfinex will only respond to law enforcement requests for customer information, not civil requests, because Bitfinex does not get involved in civil matters, in particular in the United States since US courts do not have jurisdiction over us,\u201d Sarah Compani, Bitfinex legal adviser, told Schober\u2019s lawyer Ethan Mora via email in response.\n\n\u201cThe reason that some of these crypto exchanges like FTX and Bitfinex incorporate in the British Virgin Islands or the Caymans is for those legal reasons, where they don\u2019t necessarily have to abide by US law, or any other law,\u201d Schober said.\n\n\u201cThey can just be down there and be kind of extrajudicial. They didn\u2019t even really give us an answer.\u201d\n\nBlockworks has reached out to Bitfinex for comment.\n\nWith no way into Bitfinex directly, Mora initiated what\u2019s known as a Touhy request to the Cyber Division of the FBI \u2014 demanding documents and other information related to the agency\u2019s own investigations into the malware. Schober had reported the hack to the FBI just after he lost the bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe FBI started to issue subpoenas to companies that were involved in the malware, like Reddit [where it was posted] and GitHub, which was hosting it,\u201d Schober said. The subpoenas happened in late 2018, early 2019. The FBI had even seized his computer for a few months as part of their investigation.\n\nIt took around 10 months, but the Touhy request worked. Suddenly, Schober\u2019s team had internal Bitfinex data pointing to the exact IP and email addresses tied to the accounts which had received his stolen bitcoin.\n\n\u201cWe really had no idea what the FBI investigation had uncovered until we got the response from the DOJ regarding the Touhy questions,\u201d Mora said.\n\nVanity address comes back to bite\n\nThanks to the FBI subpoena, Schober\u2019s team could identify the hacker\u2019s accounts across a suite of online services: Gmail, Keybase, Reddit, Twitter and Github. Code necessary for the malware was found on the alleged hacker\u2019s public GitHub repository, including the BTC address generator on which it hinged.\n\nThe 1BeNedict address used to launder stolen BTC through ShapeShift was also verified by some of those accounts \u2014 which Bax cited as proof of the hacker\u2019s identity (the vanity address matched his first name).\n\nA return address lodged with ShapeShift by the attacker during the apparent laundering process, where the protocol would send crypto in the case of transaction issues, was identical to the Bitfinex hot wallets which had received BTC stolen from Schober.\n\nThere was even a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, sent from an email address matching the alleged hacker\u2019s real name, which described how easy it was to generate Bitcoin addresses with a striking resemblance to ones provided. The post matched the Electrum malware\u2019s modus operandi to a tee.\n\nAfter running enough diagnostics, Bax found that \u201cevery bitcoin transaction sent by the Electrum Atom malware operator went to a destination address that was linked\u201d to the alleged hacker that had been investigated by the FBI. Addresses tied to the malware had received 17 BTC ($501,000) in total \u2014 97% of it Schober\u2019s. He was able to get in touch with another victim via long-running Bitcoin forum BitcoinTalk.\n\nBitcoin has been through an entire bull cycle since Schober\u2019s phishing incident | Chart by David Canellis\n\nAll this meant Schober could lodge a civil lawsuit against the suspected perpetrator \u2014 along with another individual who\u2019d allegedly peddled the same malware on Reddit. Both were underage at the time of the heist, so the suit also named their parents. All parties deny any wrongdoing.\n\nThat was in May 2021, more than three years after Schober was phished for his BTC. The price of bitcoin had more than doubled in that time.\n\nComplicating matters is that the alleged hacker lives in the UK. The FBI referred the case to UK law enforcement, leading to a joint investigation. Both suspects were arrested, interrogated and had their devices seized and forensically searched, Schober said.\n\nBut before their arrest, desperation (and perhaps a touch of naivety) meant Schober contacted them and their parents to let them know they\u2019d been identified. \u201cI hoped they would come clean and just return it to me because all I was doing was asking them to return what was stolen, and they didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Schober said.\n\n\u201cThe UK Crown Prosecution Service ended up telling me that after I contacted them, they likely destroyed their devices because they had entirely new devices and there wasn\u2019t enough forensic evidence for them to warrant pressing charges.\u201d\n\n(Bax said he would have done the exact same thing as Schober did \u2014 they figured the parents were probably decent people on account they worked at a bank and at the UK National Health Service. \u201cThey should just give the money back and I\u2019d think it all goes away.\u201d)\n\nSchober\u2019s civil suit is now potentially his one-and-only shot at justice. But the case is moving slowly, with lawyers arguing over in which jurisdiction a trial should take place.\n\nLawyers for the alleged hacker say the suit should be dismissed because Schober, based in the US, doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction over someone in the UK. They also argue that the statute of limitations has expired for him to file a complaint.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not true from our perspective because it took so much time and effort and investigation to even identify that it was a human being that was on the other end of this,\u201d Schober said.\n\nHe feels he shouldn\u2019t be punished by the statute of limitations argument, considering he was forced to wait 10 months for an FBI subpoena after being stonewalled by Bitfinex over critical information to his case.\n\nAn unprecedented case\n\nSchober\u2019s situation could really be the first of its kind, as it stretches across the pond.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many cases like this one, in fact, I\u2019m not aware of any cases where an individual has ever tracked down, properly served (under international law), and sued hackers like this\u2026 let alone hackers who stole cryptocurrency,\u201d Mora said.\n\n\u201cI was involved in some cases here in California where some individual plaintiffs sued some domestic scammers/hackers from other US states, but those defendants had been arrested in the US.\u201d\n\nMora highlighted cases in which the government brought criminal charges against blackhats foreign and domestic, as well as instances where tech giants like Amazon and Google sued their hackers, some of which demand ransoms in crypto.\n\nSchober is anything but a multinational conglomerate \u2014 a typical guy, unlike some high-profile wealthy victims of crypto theft that have brought cases against their attackers.\n\n\u201cI believe this case is unprecedented in a number of ways\u2026there\u2019s no telling how long this case could be going on,\u201d Mora said.\n\nGitHub couldn\u2019t let Schober know if law enforcement had investigated, making the Touhy request a gamble that paid off\n\nExactly how it might be resolved is really anyone\u2019s guess. If a US court rules that the hacker owes Schober, then an English court would still need to recognize that ruling before it can enforce the judgment in the UK. Eventually, it could even come down to debt collection, liens or even wage garnishment.\n\nSchober said they\u2019d been able to trace a sizable amount of bitcoin sitting in addresses gleaned from the FBI subpoena, so it appears the alleged hackers do have funds to pay Schober back.\n\nThe situation is especially frustrating considering it seems Schober knows exactly who stole his crypto.\n\nStill, Schober is pro-Bitcoin, despite everything that\u2019s happened, legal fees and the half-million dollars in bitcoin lost. \u201cI still love the promise of Bitcoin. That was what got me into it in the first place. But certainly, my early mover advantage has been erased, which is painful.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it hurts but I\u2019m still positive about it at this point. And I\u2019m proud of the fact that I\u2019ve been able to take this case to the point where it\u2019s at now, because the odds against it were very, very slim.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s optimistic that US courts will see that he\u2019s a victim of theft. Had the alleged attackers been based in Russia or North Korea, for example, he\u2019d hardly have any recourse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been five years and I\u2019m ready to move on from this as soon as possible,\u201d Schober said. \u201cBut on the other hand, I\u2019ve really put in so much effort and time and have people like Bax, and others, that are in my corner because they\u2019ve heard the story and they think it\u2019s kind of remarkable.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m resolved to see it through to the end.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "By Anonymous Guest Writer\n\nLike most people who first discover Bitcoin, I learned about it as its rapidly inflating price was making the news. This was in 2017, and I was wrapping up my Neurology residency. The news proclaimed that \u201cblockchain technology\u201d would one day change the world but that Bitcoin itself was only part of that broader technology and not the technology itself. I assumed they were correct. I assumed that the bubble would eventually burst since Bitcoin was being portrayed in the news as the next \u201cTulip Mania.\u201d\n\nSure enough, Bitcoin began a long decline in late 2017 in what has been called \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d Bitcoin started around $1,000 in 2017 and hit a peak of $20,000 in December of that year. By February 2018, Bitcoin\u2019s price had tumbled to around $8,500.\n\nAfter the bubble popped, I gave Bitcoin no more thought for the next several years and assumed it would continue an inexorable decline toward $0. This is because I hadn\u2019t done the work to learn about it. I assumed what I was told\u2014that it was a bubble\u2014was correct without giving it any more thought.\n\nI next heard about Bitcoin again in late 2020 when all assets were on a stimulus-induced sugar high following the rapid COVID crash and the resulting trillions of dollars pumped into the money supply. To my surprise, Bitcoin had not died off, and it was actually rapidly approaching its prior all-time high.\n\nThis is when I first invested in Bitcoin.\n\nI did not understand it yet, but speculation was plentiful at that time, including the birth of \u201cmeme stocks.\u201d Investing in Bitcoin seemed like an easy way to make some money, given how all risk assets were booming with no end in sight. White coat investors don\u2019t allocate high percentages of their income to these sorts of things, but I figured 5% or less as \u201cplay money\u201d couldn\u2019t hurt and was within reason. The rest of my portfolio was still all US and international market cap-weighted ETFs.\n\nI now view my Bitcoin investment as much more than \u201cplay money\u201d or mere speculation. I view it as a hedge against the fiat monetary system and a truly unique asset. I only developed this view gradually after a couple of years of careful analysis and thought.\n\nDr. Jim Dahle has argued that he is more or less neutral on crypto as an asset class, and he thinks we as high-income professionals do not need crypto in our portfolios. He also stated that even if crypto does thrive, Bitcoin is akin to AOL, and it will not be the winner when all is said and done. This guest post will hopefully provide you with some insight into my journey down the crypto rabbit hole and why I now view Bitcoin as NOT the next AOL but rather as the prime crypto asset with a chance to provide every individual with property rights and power over oppression from governments.\n\nThis is the story of why Bitcoin is now a core holding in my portfolio\u2014and why I think Bitcoin also belongs in your portfolio.\n\nDown the Rabbit Hole\n\nOnce I invested in Bitcoin, I quickly learned more and more about it, and I went fully down the crypto rabbit hole. It all seemed easy enough to pick up. Bitcoin was \u201cdigital gold\u201d to be used as a store of value. All the rest were \u201caltcoins.\u201d Ethereum was \u201cdigital oil\u201d to be used in the daily grind of processing smart contracts via its \u201cEthereum Virtual Machine\u201d on the blockchain. And there were a host of other smaller cryptocurrencies\u2014Solana, Polkadot, Cardano, Avalanche\u2014that were the so-called Layer 1 protocols\u2014which were faster, cheaper alternatives vying for Ethereum\u2019s coveted No. 2 spot for total market cap in crypto. This was in addition to stablecoins like USDC, BUSD, and Tether (among others).\n\nI figured that even though no ETF existed for cryptocurrencies, I would dollar-cost-average into some of them each month to create a roughly market-weighted collection. I could then be a part of a technology that seemed poised to have a bright future before \u201cinstitutional investors\u201d would pour their money into them and drive their prices soaring. My investment at this time was fully geared toward speculation.\n\nMore information here:\n\nWhat\u2019s the Future of Cryptocurrency? These Fanatics Say It\u2019s Pretty Darn Bright\n\nBitcoin ETFs: What You Need to Know and Should You Invest?\n\nAltcoins, the Role of Venture Capitalists in Crypto, and \u2018Sh*tcoin Casinos'\n\nSpend any time on \u201ccrypto Twitter\u201d or Reddit, and you\u2019ll quickly run into the term \u201ctoxic Bitcoin maximalist.\u201d This term refers to anyone who feels that Bitcoin is the only worthwhile cryptocurrency and that all others are scams\u2014not \u201caltcoins\u201d but \u201csh*tcoins.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand this viewpoint at first. Surely, I thought, diversification made the most sense and that it was the most reasonable approach.\n\nAs I delved deeper into crypto, however, I began to see their point. I learned that pretty much every altcoin has a marketing team and a \u201cfoundation\u201d that, in effect, acts like the board of a company and ultimately drives the direction of the development of the altcoin. Prior to \u201cgoing public\u201d and releasing their tokens for sale to the public, all of these altcoins already had made substantial numbers of the tokens available to venture capitalist insiders. See the figure below for percentages of insider allocations by various popular altcoins (it\u2019s 0% for Bitcoin).\n\nAfter everyone on the inside has their share of cheap coins, they then release the coins to the public, publicize them aggressively to pump up their price, and use retail investors as exit liquidity while the price often dumps.\n\nThese altcoins are all securities, and their founders and financial backers are selling these securities to the public without due disclosures. They all pass what\u2019s known as the Howey Test used by the SEC to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a security. To pass the Howey Test, a transaction must involve: 1) an investment of money, 2) in a common enterprise, 3) for a reasonable expectation of profit, 4) and derived from the effort of others. Every altcoin is a security. The exception is possibly stablecoins which do not stand a reasonable expectation of profit, as they are expected to remain pegged 1:1 to the currency which they are designed to track.\n\nIn effect, every single altcoin on the market, with the exception of stablecoins, is a security. The good ones are essentially fledgling companies with no products of real utility that are committing securities fraud. The bad ones are Ponzi schemes committing security fraud. We saw this play out when the Luna altcoin famously imploded over almost 24 hours, evaporating almost $40 billion of wealth overnight. Before Luna, there have been countless rug pulls after rug pulls. Even several crypto \u201ccustodians\u201d and exchanges such as Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, and FTX\u2014all funded by venture capital\u2014went under due to a combination of abysmal risk management and outright fraud. As I write this, Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world, has just been sued by the US government for fraudulently trading against its users for profit. The world of venture capital and altcoin is a cesspool.\n\nBitcoin maximalists call the companies that sell altcoins \u201csh*tcoin casinos,\u201d and after following this industry for the last couple of years, boy do I ever agree with this sentiment. You might get lucky by buying these altcoins on their way up and make a huge gain, but more likely, you\u2019ll only ever hear about them after a pump and you'd end up riding the losses down.\n\nThe odds are forever stacked in favor of the founders and against you and me. I personally made tens of thousands on altcoins, and as crypto crashed, I lost those tens of thousands. More and more, I began to view Bitcoin as the prime crypto asset and focused most of my attention on learning why Bitcoin maximalists think it\u2019s so darn special. I eventually paused my investments in non-Bitcoin crypto in 2022, and in early 2023, I made the decision to close all of my non-Bitcoin positions and focus only on investing in Bitcoin as a crypto asset. More on this below.\n\nMore information here:\n\n13 Lessons to Learn from Sam Bankman-Fried and the FTX Meltdown\n\nBitcoin Is Unique from Crypto\n\nBitcoin separates itself from all the altcoins not just because it \u201ccame first\u201d and because it's the most well-known cryptocurrency. It stands out for many reasons. Its founder(s) are not known, only existing by a pseudonym known as Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity was never discovered and who seemed to completely disappear early in the life of the project. No Bitcoins were ever dropped out of the air or \u201cpre-mined\u201d to the founders or any insiders for their benefit. Even Satoshi Nakamoto himself had to use electricity and his own CPU to mine the first Bitcoins. Anyone who knew about Bitcoin could do the same.\n\nThis is in direct contrast to other cryptos that allocate ample control and wealth to their founders and venture capital-backed investors before making it available to the public. Bitcoin has no CEO. Bitcoin has no marketing department. Bitcoin is not a security. Anyone with electricity and an ASIC machine can mine Bitcoin, just as anyone with electricity and heavy machinery can pull oil out of the ground or dig gold out of the earth. Bitcoin is a digital commodity\u2014the first ever and only digital commodity. It\u2019s the only cryptocurrency viewed by Gary Gensler and the SEC as a commodity, and he has made this point numerous times publicly. He\u2019s also made the inverse point\u2014that all other cryptocurrencies are securities\u2014many times.\n\nBitcoin as a Store of Value\n\nWhat really made me realize the importance of a good store of value was when I started listening to interviews with Michael Saylor\u2014who is, in essence, a Bitcoin maximalist who famously has placed his company, MicroStrategy, on the \u201cBitcoin Standard\u201d by converting all of its treasury to Bitcoin.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have $1 million and you want to pass it down so that 100 years from now, your great-great-grandchildren can receive it and have the same buying power that it has today. What do you do? You certainly wouldn\u2019t keep it in cash. In the past 100 years, $1 million would have become around $40,000.\n\nYou could buy real estate, but then you\u2019d have to keep up with maintenance costs while also paying property taxes. You could rent out the house, but you\u2019d have to have a competent property manager and you\u2019d be at the whim of the local real estate market. What if the house is in the next Detroit? And what if you live in the developing world and your chances of buying a house in the US are akin to the average American\u2019s ability to buy a professional sports team as a store of value?\n\nYou could buy a basket of stocks. We take this for granted in the US, but there are 2 billion individuals across the world who are unbanked and who have no hope to partake in the returns that equities have to offer. Moreover, when times have gotten tough for countries or when governments have taken a hard turn, entire stock markets have been shut down and all the wealth \u201cstored\u201d in them evaporated overnight.\n\nNext up is gold. Gold has been the most enduring store of value in human history. Why? Because it\u2019s \u201chard money.\u201d If your civilization uses seashells as a store of value because they take time and energy to collect but a technology is developed that allows for the extraction of unlimited amounts of seashells from the ocean, seashells will become valueless. Even for other metals such as copper and nickel, if their price goes up sufficiently, people will become incentivized to increase their production such that those who use these metals as a store of value will soon find themselves without any value left at all.\n\nGold, however, is remarkably hard to mine, and despite wild fluctuations in its price, its total supply increases relatively slowly each year. According to the CME group, from 1965 until 2020, the annual growth in the percentage of gold has been remarkably consistent between 1.1% to a max of 2.1% per year. Even with a meager 1.5% inflation rate, $1 million would be whittled down to only $220,000 over 100 years. And although gold has been the best store of value we\u2019ve had as a society, it has its flaws. In a digital world, how can you transmit gold across the world to pay for a good or service? How do you easily divide it as needed to pay for small amounts of goods? And if war does break out, lugging around a large suitcase of gold certainly would not be inconspicuous.\n\nWith every area of weakness that gold has, Bitcoin shines. It is highly portable\u2014all you must do is remember 12 words and you can take a lifetime\u2019s worth of wealth anywhere in the world. It\u2019s highly divisible\u2014the smallest unit of Bitcoin, one Satoshi, is currently only 2 cents. It cannot be counterfeited. A bar of gold could be filled with various metals plated with gold making it hard to verify its authenticity quickly, but Bitcoin can be verified by your own node in your own home within seconds. It\u2019s incredibly scarce\u2014its current inflation rate is 1.8%, and this will be cut in half every four years. Ninety percent of the supply has already been mined. This means that the cumulative rate of inflation over the next 120 years will be 10%, or 0.08% per year over this period.\n\nThis next point is a very important one. History has shown that, over time, value flows from weak stores of value to strong ones. This is why societies no longer use seashells, glass beads, copper, nickel, or other similar metals as stores of value. Bitcoin has the best technical characteristics of any store of value that has existed in the history of man, and it\u2019s readily available to anyone with an internet connection and a smartphone\u2014in any amount from a fraction of a penny to billions of dollars. Billions of dollars can be transacted within minutes across the world with absolute finality in a non-censorable way with no need for trusted intermediaries. This is absolutely unprecedented in human history. There is no other technology that has done this. As time goes on, how much of the purported $400 trillion of global wealth will flow into it?\n\nBitcoin as a Weapon Against Tyranny: Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake\n\nEven more importantly than any of the above, Bitcoin, unlike any altcoin, is truly decentralized. This is its greatest strength. In early 2022, the government of Canada halted bank transactions that were sent to support participants in demonstrations against COVID mandates. The banks did not put up a fight. They had to comply. A democratic government took an autocratic turn, and the current banking system was absolutely inept and unwilling to fight for its customers.\n\nBitcoin transactions to the protestors, however, could not be stopped. Bitcoin has no CEO or board to \u201cgo to\u201d to reverse a transaction or freeze an account. It is truly permissionless and uncensorable. Contrast this with Ethereum whose \u201cTornado Cash\u201d app was effectively shut down by the US government. There are also several instances of the USDC stablecoin, which runs on Ethereum and several other Layer 1 chains, holding certain transactions from going through. This can happen because most protocols besides Bitcoin are \u201cDINO\u201d\u2014decentralized in name only.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons people call Bitcoin \u201coutdated technology\u201d and argue it will be replaced by a cheaper, more energy-efficient crypto is that Bitcoin uses what's known as Proof of Work (POW). Most other cryptos, including Ethereum, use Proof of Stake (POS). In brief, POW requires \u201cminers\u201d to make guesses via a specific algorithm (SHA-256) that requires brute force to guess a specific number. Once guessed, it can be readily verified by any \u201cnode\u201d within seconds. The computers that mine Bitcoin are making these guesses to the tune of about 350 quintillion guesses per second. As more miners exist to make guesses, the Bitcoin algorithm automatically adjusts to become harder. This is what guarantees that Bitcoin cannot inflate any more than it is programmed to do\u2014the more people mine it, the harder it gets to mine. All of these machines require electricity. In today's world, with people's concern about electricity use and global warming, it's clear to see why some attack Bitcoin due to its electricity usage.\n\nMost other cryptos use POS to be more energy efficient. This uses a \u201cstaked\u201d or locked amount of crypto and much lower computational power\u2014thus, much less electricity. \u201cBad actors\u201d would lose their staked crypto, thus incentivizing good behavior by the transaction validators. Unfortunately, POS's fatal flaw is that those with larger amounts of crypto will see power accrue to them disproportionately over time, similar to what happens in systems with fiat currencies. In our economy, those with more starting capital make a profit much more easily on their capital over time, and the effects can be monumental over generations and contribute to income inequality and oligarchies.\n\nSimilarly, those with more Ethereum to start with (insiders and the Ethereum Foundation) will only gain more Ethereum and more power over the network in the long run. In contrast to this, Bitcoin's POW mechanism ensures that regardless of how much Bitcoin you may have, you do not get more control over the network. Anyone can stand to mine just as much Bitcoin as anyone else if they \u201cdo the work.\u201d\n\nIt's this essential feature of POW that makes it absolutely necessary to have a truly decentralized cryptocurrency over time. Without proof of work, anyone\u2019s control or power in the system can be changed at the click of a button by the foundation of an altcoin\u2014a crucial hindrance to wide trust and adoption. It\u2019s just numbers on a screen with every crypto besides Bitcoin. Once you understand this, you see that Bitcoin's \u201cbug\u201d of relying on \u201coutdated\u201d POW is its shining feature. And in the POW world of crypto, Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate is 1 million times higher than the two next largest POW cryptos (Dogecoin and Litecoin).\n\nBitcoin is the 800-pound gorilla of truly decentralized cryptocurrencies, and the next two largest are the 0.0008-pound fleas on its back.\n\nMore information here:\n\nTop 7 Uses for Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin Stands Alone: Why Bitcoin Belongs in Your Portfolio\n\nNow, you may be telling yourself that all of the above is well and good, but why the heck should you care about it and why should you have Bitcoin in your portfolio? I recently decided to sell my other cryptos and go 100% Bitcoin for my portfolio\u2019s 10% crypto allocation. I chose this percentage because I believe a reasonable price target will be at least $250,000 per Bitcoin if it becomes a global store of value protocol (more on this below), and this would represent a nice boost to my overall returns without risking too much capital.\n\nI could retire just fine without this 10%, but I would get a meaningful boost in spending power if this 10% of my portfolio does a 10x. Even so, we, as physicians, would be just fine from an investment return standpoint never investing in Bitcoin. We could settle for market average returns. We don\u2019t need home runs. However, as I tried to argue above, Bitcoin is not some hot stock. Its unique properties of decentralization and uncensorability make it a special asset to hold.\n\nConsider this quote from Vladimir Lenin: \u201cThere are centuries when nothing happens, and there are weeks when centuries happen.\u201d We all saw this play out firsthand in early 2020 when mask mandates were rapidly rolled out (and were welcomed by most), trillions of dollars were printed, and our day-to-day lives were completely upended. We saw it again when the relative post-Cold War peace between global powers abruptly ended as Russia started its treacherous campaign into Ukraine in early 2022.\n\nThe events of these last few years are not without consequence. Consider (figures below) the total US dollar money supply (M2), the total assets held by the federal reserve, and the total US public debt. It\u2019s not a surprise to most people that the US has a tremendous debt of $31 trillion and an extra $60 trillion in unfunded Social Security and Medicare liabilities. How does the US pay off its bill? It can either raise taxes or continue to borrow and balloon the deficit further.\n\nThis is not a new problem. Since the time of the Roman Empire, largess in spending has led to hard decisions about how to reign in the deficit, and time and time again, it\u2019s proven more politically expedient to debase the currency and cause a \u201csoft default\u201d over time rather than raise taxes. As for the Romans, they debased their currency by diluting their coins with cheaper metals. As for the US, Richard Nixon took the US off the gold standard and the US unofficially defaulted on its debt in 1971 with the ability to print more money as needed. We thankfully have remained the world\u2019s global reserve currency despite this.\n\nUnfortunately, the US government recently decided to weaponize the US dollar against Russia. This served our strategic interests in the short term, but undoubtedly in the long term, it will make all countries that store their wealth in the dollar question if their wealth, too, can be frozen as a political weapon. Ultimately, all fiat currencies have suffered the same fate in the end.\n\nI highly recommend \u201cBig Debt Crises\u201d and \u201cPrinciples for Dealing with the Changing World Order\u201d by Ray Dalio for much more comprehensive information and background about what governments have historically done during these times. In short, if hyperinflation hits the US, it might be hard and it may be fast. Capital controls would likely be quickly enacted, and bank accounts and brokerages would possibly be frozen. Just as COVID mandates were not seen as overt intrusions by the government by most citizens\u2014especially at the time\u2014most will likely welcome these \u201cnecessary measures.\u201d It would then become glaringly obvious that all of our portfolios were just numbers on a screen.\n\nJ.P. Morgan said before Congress in 1912, \u201cGold is money. Everything else is credit.\u201d Governments began to seize gold from the populace at large around World War I in the case of Britain and in 1933 in the US with Executive Order 6102, making gold illegal to hold for 41 years and stripping the individual of power while giving vast amounts of it to the government. Consider also that in the not-so-distant future, global governments, including the US, will be rolling out Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) which will give governments and central banks unprecedented oversight into how we spend our money and what we are allowed to do with that money. Central bankers want to boost the economy? In the next recession, they could program your money to either be spent on goods or sit idly in your checking account, losing x% per year as a penalty for not spending, while simultaneously being programmed such that it can\u2019t be sent to any brokerage. Buy too much carbon-positive beef this month? Your CBDC is turned off from buying more beef until next month.\n\nI know all of the above must make it seem like I\u2019m a raving Orwellian who sits in his basement clutching a shotgun waiting for the world to end. I promise I\u2019m not! However, I am a realist and a student of history. As Jim has said many times to all white coat investors, the real risk to a portfolio is not volatility but rather it\u2019s inflation, deflation, confiscation, and devastation. Holding Bitcoin won\u2019t stop a bomb from dropping on my head, and stocks and real estate do well enough dealing with inflation over the long run. Holding Bitcoin does, however, provide me with true protection against confiscation in a way that stocks, bonds, and real estate do not. No one can take away my Bitcoin or dictate how I spend it. No one government can place capital controls on it. This property makes Bitcoin an invaluable part of any portfolio, even that of a white coat investor.\n\nI invest 90% in stocks hoping for the best. I invest 10% in Bitcoin prepared for the worst.\n\nIn summary, Bitcoin is wonderfully unique. It\u2019s a truly decentralized protocol that, unlike all other cryptocurrencies, is not a company or run by any organization or group.\n\nBitcoin has no competition; any cryptocurrency that appears to compete with it crumbles away under any real analysis. Bitcoin is insurance. Bitcoin protects against currency debasement by providing an exit ramp from fiat currency if a global fiat debt crisis occurs. Like any insurance, it\u2019s best bought before you need it. Bitcoin is freedom money\u2014the separation of money and state. You don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to spend it, and no one\u2014not even the almighty government\u2014can stop you from spending it when and how you like. Bitcoin is digital scarcity. No matter how valuable it becomes, it is programmed to only be produced in diminishing amounts each year; this is codified and cannot be changed in response to price or political pressure. Bitcoin is digital property. It gives every human on earth who has a smartphone and internet access to property that cannot be confiscated under coercion.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is not the next AOL. It\u2019s a protocol growing stronger by the day with no competition, and it's already too big to be stopped. Bitcoin is the next TCP/IP upon which AOL and the internet were built, but for money. Bitcoin may well stand to be the future base layer protocol of the global monetary system.\n\nMore information here:\n\nWhy I\u2019m Still Buying Crypto\n\nAppendix: Answers to Common Criticisms of Bitcoin\n\n#1 Bitcoin Is Too Volatile to Hold\n\nThe least volatile asset to hold is the US dollar. It\u2019s lost 88% of its purchasing power since 1971. For those who understand what they own and only allocate a responsible portion of their portfolio to it, it can be a wonderful complement to other assets in a portfolio. What I look at to value Bitcoin\u2019s success is not its price. Instead, it's 1) the growth of the number of users in the network, 2) the growth of its security (ie., its hash rate), and 3) the growth of conviction of the users of the network.\n\n1) The number of Bitcoin addresses with a non-zero balance has been steadily growing since its inception according to @IntoTheBlock.\n\n2) Despite fluctuations in its price (black line in the chart below, via Blockchain.com), Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate (blue line) has been up and to the right since its inception. The only hiccup was in 2021 when China banned Bitcoin mining, but it quickly recovered as miners relocated, demonstrating the resilience of the network.\n\n3) Despite all of its price fluctuations, most of those who own Bitcoin understand it and know what they own\u2014and they aren\u2019t selling. Fifty percent of Bitcoin has not moved in more than two years, an all-time high. This only serves to increase its scarcity.\n\n#2 You Can\u2019t Actually Spend It\n\nApproximately 15,000 businesses worldwide accept Bitcoin. Additionally, companies such as Strike exist that can convert Bitcoin to local currency, instantly allowing you to spend Bitcoin even where it\u2019s not directly accepted.\n\n#3 It Takes Too Long for Transactions to Settle\n\nThe Bitcoin block time is approximately every 10 minutes. However, the Lightning Network, which has been rapidly increasing in the number of transactions in the last couple of years, can settle transactions on top of the base Bitcoin network in seconds with finality.\n\n#4 Bitcoin Can Only Handle a Limited Number of Transactions Per Second\n\nThis is a common argument made by the other so-called Layer 1 cryptocurrencies. There is a commonly cited \u201cTrilemma\u201d in cryptocurrency: speed, security, and scalability. You can only have two out of the three on the base layer. Bitcoin has opted for speed and security. However, this is not a real problem as Layer 2 solutions, like the Lightning Network, enable exponentially more transactions than the base layer allows, vastly increasing scalability and eliminating this problem.\n\n#5 Bitcoin Is a Ponzi Scheme; It\u2019s Not \u2018Worth' Anything; There\u2019s No Way to Know How Much Bitcoin Will Go Up or Down in Price\n\nI hope I've proven how much value Bitcoin uniquely provides as an asset. If more and more people wish to save some of their wealth using Bitcoin due to its superior attributes as a store of value, this will drive up its price.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that Bitcoin is a better store of value than gold, and over time, its market cap comes to equal that of gold, which is currently around $13 trillion. This would make each Bitcoin worth $620,000 (13 trillion divided by 21 million, which is Bitcoin\u2019s fixed cap). Consider that the total sum of all of the stores of value in the world is approximately $550 trillion at a minimum ($325 trillion in global real estate; $115 trillion in global bonds; $100 trillion in global stock; $10 trillion in gold; $10 trillion in antiques, cars, collectibles, art, etc.). Let\u2019s assume 75% of these are necessities, and only 25% is true excess storage of wealth.\n\nAs we discussed, Bitcoin is a superior store of value to all of these. Bonds provide minimal returns above inflation. Real estate has property taxes and maintenance costs. Gold is difficult to store and to move around in large amounts, and it's hard to quickly verify its authenticity. Over time, value flows from weak stores of value to the strongest. If this 25% eventually (over the next several decades) makes its way into Bitcoin, it would place each Bitcoin at $5.5 million. So, are you still scared to buy Bitcoin at $20,000-$70,000? Also, consider that the price of any asset is determined at the margins. A bottle of water may cost $1-$3 dollars in normal times. But if it\u2019s the only bottle of water in a desert with 100 millionaires on it, its price suddenly becomes the net worth of the richest millionaire who wants it. Similarly, if there is a shock to the legacy fiat systems, the price of Bitcoin may rapidly inflate as the ultra-wealthy scramble for the exits.\n\n#6 But Bitcoin Doesn\u2019t Have Any Smart Contracts\n\nThis is true for now. But consider this. Smart contracts are useful when you want the blockchain to automatically execute a function under a set condition. However, you could also just use a regular company to do this. For instance, if I want to have a smart contract that will pay me 5% interest if I loan out my \u201csh*tcoin\u201d to someone else, there is something known as a bank that can facilitate this process. Now, the blockchain does remove the middleman and automates the process, which provides some value. However, if you\u2019re talking about billions and billions of dollars at stake between large players, the security and immutability of the base settlement layer becomes of utmost importance. The only chain that is not reversible and under the control of any foundation is Bitcoin. It\u2019s the only cryptocurrency that\u2019s not a de facto company. A company that can be controlled is no better than a bank or any other company. Therefore, any smart contract network that will gain wide adoption by the \u201cbig players\u201d will have to be built on top of the Bitcoin network if they are to be trusted for transactions of consequence.\n\n#7 If It\u2019s Such a Great Store of Value, Why Has Bitcoin Not Been an Inflation Hedge?\n\nBitcoin has had booms and busts due to excessive leverage, speculation, and greed. But all of that aside, it\u2019s been the best-performing asset on the planet since its inception, and it keeps hitting higher lows. If you can stomach its early volatile phase, it stands to provide great future returns. If you wait to buy it once it\u2019s become more of a globally established store of value, the volatility will be diminished. But so will future returns.\n\nThere is a saying among Bitcoin maximalists: Don\u2019t wait to buy Bitcoin; buy Bitcoin and wait.\n\n#8 Isn\u2019t Bitcoin Supposed to Be Terrible for The Environment?\n\nThis is a common argument by the mainstream media. According to the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC)\u2014a global forum of mining companies that represents 48.4% of the worldwide Bitcoin mining network\u2014renewable energy sources accounted for 58.9% of the electricity used to mine Bitcoin in Q4 2022. That's a significant improvement compared to the 36.8% estimated in Q1 2021. What\u2019s more, Bitcoin actually incentivizes the use of renewable energy. If you develop a coal plant, you can burn more coal when needed to adjust to the demand on the energy grid. However, if you build solar panels or windmills, you have no use for that energy when the grid does not demand it, and you miss out on potential profits. If you can mine Bitcoin with the excess energy, you\u2019ve effectively found a way to generate income even when there is no demand for your source of renewable energy, thereby helping to subsidize the cost of the investment.\n\nThis can be a boon to the development of more renewable sources of energy and can help provide further stability to the power grid. There are even companies that harness flared methane from natural gas operations and help decrease how much harmful methane gets into the atmosphere. The topic of Bitcoin and energy is much more complicated than it would appear at first glance. Furthermore, consider that clothes dryers use more energy on a yearly basis than Bitcoin mining. Where is the outcry about this and why is there not a push to ban them? We can all hang out our clothes to dry, but this use of electricity to secure the best store of value ever created and a means to escape government oppression cannot be achieved without the use of sufficient energy to secure the Bitcoin network and make it resistant to attacks.\n\n[Founder's Note: I hate to add a lengthy note to an already lengthy post, but on a controversial topic such as crypto (and yes, Bitcoin is crypto even if the maximalists don't like the rest of the world saying so), it must be done. You need not assume that because you just read a lengthy, relatively positive article about Bitcoin on this website that I have somehow changed how I feel about it. I have not. I still think it is an optional asset class at best and not one that I have any plans to invest in. In fact, as time goes on and crypto still hasn't changed the world in a way meaningful to me, I lose more and more faith that it ever will. Unlike the author who admits he jumped in despite not understanding the investment mostly because the price was going up, I've known about Bitcoin from nearly the beginning, and I certainly understand the basics of how it works. Every couple of years, I look at it again to see if something has changed enough to make me want to own it. So far, no, and the arguments in this post are neither new nor convincing to me. I'm still content to stand on the sidelines and see what happens. I don't need to invest in everything I find interesting.\n\nThe author stated he would convince us that Bitcoin is essential to protecting our property rights. He wrote that it would prevent our oppression by the government and that it should be in all of our portfolios. I would argue he has failed to do so. He contends that Bitcoin is the best store of value ever invented, yet as much as 25% of it has completely disappeared as its owners have lost their keys. Not to mention the fact that its wild volatility makes stocks and precious metals look tame in comparison. The author feels that Bitcoin cannot be confiscated. Yet the very presence of the blockchain makes it relatively easy to track down criminals who have transacted with it, and the IRS now requires crypto traders to report that activity on their tax returns. When you're threatened with jail or have a gun held to your head, you'll find those Bitcoin keys pretty quickly.\n\nAt the end of his post, the author addresses my primary criticisms of Bitcoin. Although the Lightning Network and similar improvements have made strides in addressing a couple of them, the rest still stand. It is ridiculously volatile. I still can't spend it anywhere I'm interested in spending money (and would generate capital gains every time in order to do so). It has no underlying value, uses massive amounts of electricity, doesn't offer smart contracts, and doesn't seem to be particularly good during inflationary times. If it never gets better than this, I just don't see it changing the world. But my faith in humanity and technology is such that I still hold out hope that these problems can be addressed by a modified Bitcoin or, more likely in my opinion, an entirely new cryptocurrency as Bitcoin goes the way of AOL.\n\nI truly am fascinated to see how the world might change as a result of Bitcoin and similar technology. But after 15 years, I'm no longer holding my breath. Bitcoin is a speculative instrument, and I don't put those in my portfolio. If you choose to, limit it to a single-digit percentage.]\n\nWhat do you think? Do you have Bitcoin in your portfolio? If not, would you consider adding it?

        "content": "There are two key inputs used to determine the notional value of an Ether/Bitcoin Ratio futures contract: the ratio and the contract multiplier.\n\nThe ratio can be found by dividing the price of Ether futures by the price of Bitcoin futures (using the same expiration month) rounded to the nearest tradeable tick, which goes out six decimal places. The contract multiplier is one million U.S. dollars, and the minimum tick size is five dollars per contract.\n\n(Price of Ether futures \u00f7 Price of Bitcoin futures) x $1,000,000 = Notional value\n\nFor example, if the price of June 2024 Ether futures is $1,890 and the price of June 2024 Bitcoin futures is $30,255, the notional value would be as follows:\n\n1,890 ETHN4 \u00f7 30,255 BTN4 = 0.062470 BTC/ETH\n\n0.062470 x $1,000,000 = $62,470\n\nKeep in mind that the margin required is likely to be significantly lower than the notional value of the contract.

        "title": "Bitcoin doesn't need to change, but\u2026 - Blockworks",
        "content": "Bitcoin is over ten years old, but you wouldn\u2019t know it. Almost all of the changes to its inner workings over the years have been quite conservative, leaving us a Bitcoin that Satoshi would easily recognize.\n\nProposed changes sometimes ignite a debate within the community centered around what Bitcoin truly \u201cis\u201d or \u201cneeds.\u201d While there are strong opinions and arguments on both sides, the protocol ultimately requires fundamental but careful updates, alongside meaningful but functional second-layer applications.\n\nWhen thinking about Bitcoin\u2019s future, it\u2019s essential to consider the repercussions of ossification. I\u2019ve touched on this topic several times \u2014 but in a nutshell, ossification is the process whereby so many applications get built on top of a protocol and adopted by the masses that it becomes exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to alter the underlying protocol without breaking almost everything.\n\nWith thousands or tens of thousands of third-party services relying on the base network, it\u2019s infeasible to coordinate upgrades across every provider simultaneously. We\u2019ve already seen this occur with protocols like TCP, one of the primary mechanisms used to handle internet traffic, and it will inevitably happen with Bitcoin.\n\nI bring this up because we don\u2019t know when Bitcoin will become too ossified to change \u2014 and there\u2019s a small chance it\u2019s already too late. This adds pressure to the entire debate because, at some point, updating through BIPs will become impossible, so solving problems at that level will be a moot point.\n\nThat being said, Bitcoin represents an uncontrollable technology that all are free to build on top of.\n\nConsidering that many, including myself, believe that there is still some important work to be done on the protocol level, we need to act swiftly to ensure the Bitcoin network is developed enough to work as the digital currency system it intended to be.\n\nUpdating Bitcoin\u2019s code is nothing new\n\nBecause the network operates around consensus, any new changes submitted via Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) need to be agreed upon (or at least not objected to) by an overwhelming portion of ecosystem participants.\n\nThis is understandably a slow and onerous process. Unsurprisingly, as a result, there have only been a handful of major upgrades in the history of the protocol.\n\nOne of these upgrades, known as Segregated Witness, or Segwit for short, represented a change in the fundamental transaction format to protect against transaction malleability: the ability to change small bits of information in an unconfirmed transaction in such a way that makes child transactions invalid.\n\nMore recently, we implemented the Taproot upgrade, enabling more scalable and private complex spending conditions for Bitcoin as well as signature aggregation. This, however, was likely not the last upgrade Bitcoin will see, and many proposals are already in the works that may eventually become a part of the core protocol.\n\nSIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT would allow a transaction to spend from any unspent transaction output that is encumbered by a given set of spending conditions. This enables greater flexibility, unlocking complex transaction constructions, such as creating atomic swaps and shared lightning network channels.\n\nThere are also covenants \u2014 a topic I\u2019ve spoken about at length \u2014 that would restrict where a given address could send Bitcoin, which holds significant security implications.\n\nDrivechains also stand to bring permissionless pegging of bitcoin to and from sidechains, which could both aid in scalability as well as experimentation.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s one major change that is pushed by ESG proponents, and that\u2019s a claim that the network should change from one secured by proof-of-work to one powered by proof-of-stake. This is being suggested because proof-of-work takes a significantly greater amount of energy to perform than proof-of-stake.\n\nEthereum recently switched to proof-of-stake, ushering in a ~99.5% reduction in energy usage. However, there are trade-offs in switching from one type of consensus mechanism to another that are more complicated than just power consumption. This article isn\u2019t going to wade through that debate, but it is one of the best examples of a controversial change that is unlikely to occur, even though it has its proponents.\n\nThe case for building on bitcoin instead\n\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem is free to update the protocol in any way it can collectively agree upon. However, further upgrades to the core code aren\u2019t the only way forward.\n\nUsers are exploring a myriad of ways that Bitcoin can be developed on top of, without changing anything within the core protocol.\n\nThere are already some well-known examples. They include the Lightning Network, a second-layer solution utilizing off-chain micropayment channels, scaling the blockchain\u2019s capacity and speed, and lowering fees. There\u2019s also been the recent addition of inscriptions, which amount to Bitcoin\u2019s own version of NFTs by embedding image data in the blockchain.\n\nA brief internet search will reveal many more such projects, and admittedly, the previous upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol made these technical achievements possible. Nonetheless, this highlights that Bitcoin, as it is now, is fully capable of being built on to enable innovative improvements.\n\nThe debate rages on\n\nSome Bitcoin proponents don\u2019t want to see the protocol change at all. Remember, there are as many opinions about these additions to the network as there are projects and proposals. Still, some purists are quite vocal about what they see as the failures of some of these endeavors.\n\nPopular Bitcoin commentator Shinobi wrote an essay outlining multiple existing shortcomings of the lightning network, explaining at length that it\u2019s unlikely to become a globally scalable, secure payment system without additional upgrades.\n\nLightning may be spurring some debates, but the recent addition of Ordinals is stirring the pot further.\n\nThe argument is largely between those who feel that Bitcoin should be strictly about financial transactions, and others who believe that the network is robust enough to host any type of data, secured by the fees required to transact them. This disagreement showcases another inherent tension between the philosophy of changing Bitcoin, against the philosophy of building on top of it.\n\nUltimately, there\u2019s no one clear path forward for Bitcoin. The protocol will continue to reflect the desires of its users as it was intended. Bitcoin is designed to exist for hundreds of years to come, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is already in its final form.\n\n\n\nMoving forward, I\u2019d like to see a combination of thoughtful, community-driven updates to the core protocol that enable and enhance innovative new protocols built on top of the base layer.\n\nThe idea that there is only one path forward is simply too restrictive of a view for something as important as Bitcoin.\n\nJameson Lopp is the CTO & cofounder of Casa, a self custody service.

        "title": "The Race to Bitcoin ETF: Here Are All the Dates to Watch Including BlackRock's - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nMany financial firms are preparing to provide Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nDespite being the last to file, one of the biggest names on the list, BlackRock, is planning to receive responses on par with others\n\nA BlackRock Bitcoin ETF might be the biggest ETF launch ever if the SEC authorizes it\n\nAnalysts think Bitcoin might rise to $180,000 before the anticipated halving in April 2024\n\nBlackrock, a well-known worldwide investment and management company, officially applied to the SEC in June of this year for permission to launch its own Bitcoin ETF, which the iShares Bitcoin Trust will administer. As it has done for years, the SEC rejected this first submission. BlackRock charged once more a month after renewing the application and taking SEC observations into account.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t only Blackrock that was interested (again) in setting up such a fund. Many other financial institutions, previously denied by the SEC multiple times, reiterated their applications.\n\nKey dates in the fight for approval include deadlines for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock\u2019s iShares coin Trust, Bitwise\u2019s Bitcoin ETF, Van Eck Bitcoin Trust, Wisdomtree BitcoinTrust, and many others, according to a tweet from renowned ETF analyst James Seyffart.\n\nThe second deadline for ARK 21Shares is set on August 13. This early deadline could provide ARK 21Shares with a competitive advantage.\n\nOn September 1, Bitwise has its first deadline.\n\nThe initial deadline of September 2 is shared by a sizable group of issuers, including the iShares Coin Trust by BlackRock and several others.\n\nThese issuers might face a collective judgment day due to being grouped together, which might affect the SEC\u2019s decision-making process.\n\nThe Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund\u2018s first deadline is set for September 4. To potentially learn from the results of the earlier deadlines puts Valkyrie significantly behind the remainder of the field.\n\nBlackRock At the Forefront Of the ETF Competition\n\nSince it would offer a more accessible and regulated way to invest in cryptocurrencies without dealing with the complexities of crypto wallets and exchanges, investors have been clamoring for an ETF linked to Bitcoin. BlackRock, one of the biggest names on the list, filed last but is expected to receive a response on par with those of other applicants who did so far earlier.\n\nSeyffart explained that although BlackRock\u2019s prospectus filing dates might be later, all others had already been rejected by the SEC in the 19b-4 process once or even more than once, so their timing may not be as late as it seems.\n\nWith this wave, BlackRock may be at the forefront of the ETF competition. A lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is one of the ways Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, a well-known Bitcoin investment product, is striving for ETF designation.\n\nThe judges\u2019 judgment is anticipated within the next two months. If GBTC prevails in its legal battle with the SEC, some cryptocurrency aficionados think that it might become the first Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSeyffart has cautioned that Grayscale might not be allowed to convert to an ETF even if it wins its legal battle.\n\nAfter Years of SEC Rejections, BlackRock\u2019s ETF May Change the BTC Landscape\n\nA financial tool, also known as an exchange-traded fund, tracks the performance of a specific index, industry, commodity, or asset. Trading them on conventional stock exchanges enables investors to obtain exposure to these assets.\n\nThese goods are widely available, particularly in the United States. The Security Exchange Commission and other regulators have been preventing a Bitcoin ETF for years, despite the existence of a thriving ETF industry. The coming months could see a change in this situation.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF was strongly desired in the cryptocurrency industry in 2018, but it was also one of the businesses pursuing its approval that failed the most.\n\nAfter prices reached their highest point ever in 2017 and entered a downturn phase in 2018, the narrative surrounding institutional participation gained popularity and an ETF\u2019s requirement. Even after major corporations like Tesla or MicroStrategy entered the market, it never happened.\n\nCan ETF Creation Be Denied Again?\n\nIn the opinion of Gabor Gurbacs, Advisor at VanEck and Tether, there are no good enough reasons for the SEC to reject the creation of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nGurbacs has first-hand knowledge of this because global investment firm VanEck has an active spot Bitcoin ETF application.\n\n\u201cThe SEC cited concerns about potential market manipulation, custody issues, and the overall maturity of the underlying market,\u201d he said.\n\nThe direct ownership of an underlying asset, such as Bitcoin, is represented by a spot Bitcoin ETF. When you purchase a share of a spot ETF, the fund buys an equivalent asset quantity, giving you almost a one-to-one exposure (fees excluded), explained Gurbacs.\n\nThe acceptance of a local spot ETF in the US could affect the price of Bitcoin and how traditional investors view the asset, while also delivering a highly regulated investment product that allays any SEC worries.\n\nGurbacs also asserted that by giving people and institutions a well-known and generally regulated way to get exposure to Bitcoin, the ETF might increase the number of investors in the currency. It probably would increase liquidity and enhance price discovery. Second, it might promote institutional adoption, which might help stabilize the market and reduce price volatility.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s impossible to predict when a spot Bitcoin ETF would bear, the situation is a little different than it was in 2018. For instance, El Salvador legalized Bitcoin in 2021, and a number of businesses are already stockpiling it or using it for treasury or investment management.\n\nThis new trend includes BlackRock\u2019s interest, and the acceptance of its application might completely alter the way people play the Bitcoin game.\n\nFundstrat: The price of Bitcoin Could Jump to $180,000\n\nBefore the cryptocurrency\u2019s anticipated halving in April 2024, the price of Bitcoin may increase by 521% from present levels to $180,000, according to a Fundstrat report .\n\nAlthough the daily demand for Bitcoin is approximately $25 million, the daily mining incentives are also approximately $25 million, according to the financial research firm, this could alter with the prospective introduction of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAccording to the report, a Bitcoin ETF could increase daily demand for Bitcoin by an additional $100 million. The price of Bitcoin would need to climb significantly to reach an equilibrium between buyers and sellers given this increase and the April 2024 halving, which is scheduled to reduce daily mining earnings to $12 million."

        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have had a solid run this year after a not-so-memorable 2022. The Fed\u2019s aggressive interest rate hikes to battle multi-decade-high inflation saw the cryptocurrency market taking a hit last year. This year has been good as favorable macroeconomic conditions have helped cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), make a solid rebound.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin price fell below $29,500 on Jul 26 after the Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points. Earlier this year, Bitcoin soared to a 13-month high of $31,500 driven by robust demand from institutional buyers.\n\nThe scenario is exactly opposite to that of last year. The Fed has increased interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2021, which raised doubts about the potential of Bitcoin.\n\nBesides, a series of unfortunate events like the Terra Luna crash and a major fraud that resulted in FTX\u2019s bankruptcy raised concerns about the future of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe flash crash on Wednesday was expected as market participants were almost certain about the Fed\u2019s rate hike. Growth assets like technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks and cryptocurrencies are adversely affected by higher interest rates. So, this may not entirely come as a shock.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has surged 78.1% year to date and hovered around the $30,000 mark almost through July. Economists had forecast that Bitcoin would bounce back in 2023 and gather further momentum in the second half.\n\nThis is because macroeconomic conditions are a lot more favorable now. Economic data indicates that inflation has started cooling. Although the Fed increased interest rates once again, slowing inflation has raised hopes that the latest interest rate hike could be the last in the central bank\u2019s current monetary tightening cycle.\n\nThis bodes well for the overall cryptocurrency market.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nHIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. (HIVE - USD) operates as a cryptocurrency mining firm. The company validates transactions on blockchain networks. It also provides crypto mining and builds bridges between crypto and traditional capital markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nHIVE Blockchain\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 78.1%.

        "title": "How Miners Are Preparing for the Next Bitcoin Halving - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Bitcoin's fourth having is slated for next April. So what does this mean for miners, coin desks. Special Mining week presented by Foundry is taking a closer look at the current conditions around equipment, energy use and diversification. Foundry and Coindesk are both owned by DC G. Joining us now to discuss is mining analyst, Anthony Power. Welcome to the show. Anthony. Thanks for being here. Thanks for participating in Mining Week. You wrote an article for coin desk all about this topic. So tell us about some of the key takeaways. Are you still with us, Anthony? Um Yes, I can see there you are. So tell us about the article that you wrote for Coindesk. Some of the key takeaways. Yeah. Um It, it wasn't the first article I've written on on the halving. I also write content for compass mining and I produced an article of them a few months ago. Um We're approaching the halving in April next year and this will be the fourth halving. The first block. Bitcoin was mined in January. Um 2009, the Genesis block and every 210,000 blocks, we have a halving and so the miners who were mining back in 2009 were receiving 50 Bitcoin for every block they successfully mined and that reduced to 12.5 in 2012 in 2016, that became 6.25. And, and we're going now to in 2024 the rewards will be half to 3.125 Bitcoin. And that means that, you know, miners who are mining. now, when that date comes, if the Bitcoin price remains as it is at the moment, we potentially see, you know, their, their rewards halved and effectively, you know, that means that, you know, that your costs have doubled effectively overnight. And so my article looked at um the ways that these mining companies and I analyzed the big North American public miners, but this will apply to all miners, this apply to all migrants globally. What the things that they would be doing. I'd be expecting to do between now and the haring itself and I came up with three or four different points. So, uh I, you know, I have to ask this because we've known about the having since literally the day the white paper was released, we've always known this was coming. Um But people seem to think that this is going to be some sort of bullish event uh as if nobody has ever heard of it or that the retail public hasn't heard of it. I it seems like this, this is, this happens every so often we hear about, oh, well, if you just look at a chart of Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin and it has and therefore the having is what causes the price to go up this much. But, but there are other factors, right? There's a network effect of people adopting or, or, or people trading Bitcoin at least. Um Is this really go is this correlation uh is this a spurious correlation with price? Um or is this uh an actual, you know, is it causation because it just seems so, you know, obvious II I personally believe that, you know, miners will be looking back at the previous cycles to determine what's happened. And we have seen some, you know, some consistency with the actual um with the haring itself. One thing that has been clear, the Bitcoin home price hasn't always increased overnight in line with the halving has been reduced. So, you know, one of my key points that miners should be looking at now is making sure they have enough financial runway to get them through at least four or five months after the halving. And usually by that time, the Bitcoin price has, has sort of like started to, to, to, to move. But as you, as you quite rightly allude to, there are so many other factors that can affect the Bitcoin price and we've seen that happen even in the last few years. Um with regards to, you know, um, macroeconomic factors, the war in Ukraine and, you know, so many things can affect Bitcoin. Um, but it does seem to have that resilience. Um, and even though there are many factors trying to bring it down and you've, you've talked through various of these on your, on your channel before, with, with the likes of FTX and Celsius. Um, Bitcoin just seemed to bounce back. It seems to be, you know, strong enough to take, to take those challenges on. Um But from my perspective, I'd be expecting Bitcoin miners to making sure now that they have, you know, the, the sort of the, the most efficient mining machines in preparation for that halving because you want the most efficient machines that use the least energy um knowing full well that you're going to get half the rewards. Um The second key point is really, you know, the energy cost. Um We've seen energy prices come down since 2022 and we've seen a number of miners who've been able to lock into fixed price contracts and that's going to enable them to um to, to, you know, help manage the situation. Um The cash runway is, is absolutely essential. These miners need cash to, to, to, to, to pay for their electricity, to pay for their staff's wages, to pay for their GN A costs. So that's important as well. We're seeing a number of miners starting to diversify into high performance computing um artificial intelligence um hosting other mining companies. And the, the first two we've seen the likes of and hive digital um move to that area and Irish Energy um an Australian miner with um uh currently based in the U. They're also considering using some of their capacity at the children's site um to use it for data centers. My only concern with, with, with that di diversification is it, it sounds great at the moment and we're hearing artificial intelligence mention never the sentence. I just want to make sure the revenues actually follow those, those discussions and what they're implementing there. Uh These are Bitcoin mining companies and you know, whatever they do as a sideline, there'll always be Bitcoin mining companies at the moment. Um You know, I spoke to some of the CEO S and you know, their, their expectation of revenues. Uh you know, this will not really impact significantly on what they're doing um from a Bitcoin my perspective, but it will bring some supplementary revenues and some reasonable margins potentially. So, you know, it is something for consideration because we don't know how long Bitcoin price will stay at at this level. I can't predict the Bitcoin price in April next year. You can't predict the Bitcoin price. I can't predict the Bitcoin price tomorrow. So, you know, that's I wanna touch on that, that way. I never want to hear anybody ask me. They're like, well, you know, anything about me I'm like, just leave me alone. I absolutely stop. Please making a mental note to ask Lawrence that. Now every day I'll ask you about the Canadian dollar if you keep that up. Uh, Anthony, I want to touch on that diversification piece a little bit more. It sounds like the mining industry is really solving a lot of the challenges, but it's becoming increasingly more difficult to di, to mine and hence the diversification. Do you see a lot of the miners um that are operating now, you know, diversifying completely into a different business as time goes on as mining becomes more difficult. What are you hearing from the CEO S that you're speaking to the, the, the two, the two companies that are sort of really looking to move into that space significantly. And, and the two I mentioned that were eight and I digital bear in mind, these two companies had a serious amount of GP US when they were mining Ethereum before we had the fork um last September. So all those fantastic revenues, they were mining Ethereum with their GP US stopped overnight and they've then been looking for the next thing to do with those GP US. Now, the GP US that they have, you know, I think they're high end GP U. So they've got plenty of alternative uses. I mean, a Bitcoin miner and a machine can only do one thing, it can mine Bitcoin and that's it. But the GP us have got other uses and I think they're looking to sort of like move there. Will other miners um move into that space? I, I don't think so at the moment, I think um you know, the, the the big mine companies, the Marathon digitals, the riot platforms, um we will continue to grow clean spot, add them to that, that top tier group of miners um that they'll grow their hash rates um in a sensible way. Um buying the most efficient miners on the market. And those three companies I've just mentioned, they've been buying miners this year and last year in redness for this army and they've got serious hash rate ready. So, diversification, not in, not in terms of other revenues but diversification in terms of looking to Bitcoin mine in other areas of the world and marathon digital are already up and running in the UAE. So, but, but to that point, I mean, you know, would we see, for instance, like coin, you know, you said that they can only mine Bitcoin essentially, but there are all these offshoots of Bitcoin that essentially run the same way. Uh Would we see as the price of, of mining Bitcoin goes up this idea that, well, you know what we're to set up, we anyway, we can mine BS V, we can mine uh Bitcoin cash, we can mine light coin. You know, we can kind of go to these other, these other coins that sort of use the same, use the same technology essentially. Uh, and it's costing us a lot more now to deal with, uh, to deal with, uh, mining Bitcoin. Why don't we just switch to that? I mean, like who's gonna, and also who's gonna suffer? Who do you see suffering the most, uh, with, with, with the, having the, the, the ones that suffer the most will be the ones that haven't prepared. So they haven't got, you know, they've got machines that are going to require a lot of power. Um So not the most efficient machines on the market. And, you know, you need to the machine price at the moment are actually quite low. Go back 18 months ago, people were paying seven or eight times the current price of what they're paying now for machines and a lot of these mining companies did buy at seven or eight times the price and they haven't got the cash revenues now to really start looking to change though. You know, the older machines for new machines, you know, there's not many levers available to mining companies that they can sell Bitcoin and, and most of them are selling Bitcoin every month. Now. Gone are the days where we're huddling everything. Um There's debt but debt's becoming far more trickier and 2022 was the year of debt. And we saw quite a number of miners, some went into chapter 11 and some nearly went into chapter 11. So debt really is off the table for most of the miners. And the other option is to is to dilute the company. So you know, to sell more shares and you know, 2023 will be the year of dilution for most of these companies you want to name names. Um Well, II I can tell you now that Cleans Spark Marathon, digital riot platforms are all selling shares and cleans. Spark will, will, will, you know, will tell shareholders are selling shares, they want to grow their hash rate. You know, they've grown exponentially in 2022. They were the only miner to achieve their growth target in that year. They've got a growth target, which, which was about six hash in January this year, it's going to be 16 extra hash by the end of the year. That's phenomenal growth, but that requires phenomenal investment and you can't tap into the debt markets at the moment because the interest rates with the macroeconomic climate and also the climate around what's happened in the debt cycles in the mining industry where we've seen a lot of defaults on loans. We've seen a lot of repossession of loans. We've seen a lot of um uh issues of debt fall fall on their face because they've not really looked into this too seriously and looked at the how the price of Bitcoin not only affects, you know, Bitcoin itself, but it affects the actual machinery. So when Bitcoin price comes down. The cost of these machines, the value of these machines come down as well. And that wasn't anticipated by some of these lenders. And so, you know, they've also fallen foul of what, what they tried to succeed in. Um But, you know, um II I think I cover 15 or 16 in the biggest miners and I would say categorically that 90% of those are diluting, you know, regularly. Now, they've all got these at the market offerings which enables them and they're approved by the shareholders. So the shares have to approve the at the market offering, they can sell shares effectively on a daily basis. And you don't know how many shares they've sold until the quarterly earnings report comes out. And that's generally five months after. So in the next two or three weeks, we're going to see earnings reports from all these miners we've discussed and we'll see exactly how many shares and, um, you know, just, you know, looking for it highlighted what they, um, you know, what they've done the first five months of the year, they sold 41 million shares in the first five months of 2023 to help fund their growth."

        "content": "In a 2022 survey released on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada broke down the ownership of cryptocurrencies in Canada.\n\nThe report found that Canadians sold out of their bitcoin positions in 2022, but did not \u201dshift out of Bitcoin and into other cryptoassets, as we observed decreased ownership of altcoins.\u201d\n\nPossibly adding to that statistic is the fact that the Bank of Canada found that under a third of bitcoin owners \u201care highly literate about how the Bitcoin system actually works, while a slightly larger proportion have basically no knowledge.\u201d\n\nBut altcoin ownership remained roughly the same in 2022 as it was in 2021. Only about a percent of Canadians surveyed owned a stablecoin.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201c\u2026the ownership rate for ether, the second most popular cryptoasset, declined from 7% in 2021 to 4% in 2022,\u201d the Bank wrote.\n\nRead more: Canadians appear willing to embrace CBDC: Survey\n\nThe Bank of Canada found that, in 2021, bitcoin holders cashed out for profit while \u201cthe decline in Bitcoin ownership from 13% to 10% contrasts with stable ownership rates observed from 2017 to 2018 (5%) when prices declined even more than between 2021 and 2022.\u201d\n\nLast year, the price of bitcoin was volatile as crypto winter settled in and the collapses of TerraUSD and FTX sent shockwaves throughout crypto.\n\nThe Bank of Canada believes that the decline in bitcoin ownership in 2022 \u201cshouldn\u2019t be surprising\u201d because 2021 saw many Canadians invest \u201crecord\u201d amounts in traditional financial assets as well as cryptos \u2014 such as bitcoin, which helped to \u201cexplain the increase in the ownership rate to 13% in 2021.\n\nJumping into investments isn\u2019t the only reason that Canadians were interested in bitcoin, however. The Bank noted that 24% of bitcoin owners in 2022 \u201ccited technology-related reasons, such as an interest in new technologies, for holding the cryptoasset.\u201d Only 11% said that they held bitcoin for payment reasons.\n\n\u201cWith the exception of 2021, the percentage of owners citing payment-related reasons for owning bitcoin has steadily declined from its peak in 2016,\u201d the Bank said.\n\nThe Bank stated that the volatility not only in crypto markets, but also in financial markets, helped to \u201creduce investors\u2019 appetites for risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nThe tight regulatory environment was also noted, between the Canadian Securities Administration forcing cryptocurrency platforms to \u201ccomply with investor protection laws\u201d and the US SEC regulating through enforcement helped to lessen the appetite.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin traded flat on Wednesday morning in Asia as risk-aversion remained the market theme, though the token managed to hold above US$29,000. Analysts say a possible extended legal fight between the U.S. regulator and Ripple Labs as well as comments from the Federal Reserve on the interest rate outlook expected later today is breeding caution. Ether also treaded water, while other leading tokens were a mixed picture. Dogecoin led the winners again on speculation it may be integrated into Twitter as the social media app gets revamped into a more general-purpose platform. Elsewhere, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped and U.S. equity futures traded mixed after Wall Street closed higher on Tuesday.\n\nBitcoin lacking catalysts\n\nBitcoin inched 0.14% higher over the last 24 hours to US$29,222 as of 07:35 a.m. in Hong Kong, but lost 2.07% for the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. After briefly falling to a monthly low of US$28,890 on Monday, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has seemingly found support around US$29,000.\n\n\u201cSeveral factors are currently affecting Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, including concerns about the Ripple case resumption and investors\u2019 speculation on Bitcoin investment funds,\u201d Rania Gule, an analyst at Cyprus-headquartered multi-asset broker XS Group, said in an emailed comment.\n\nThe market is keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision, while negative headlines about Binance, the world\u2019s largest digital currency exchange, contributed to price declines across crypto, Gule added.\n\n\u201cThe main trendline support currently stands at $26,800, and as long as Bitcoin remains above it, the trend is expected to be bullish,\u201d said Gule.\n\nWilliam Cai, co-founder and managing partner at New York-based asset manager Wilshire Phoenix, said Bitcoin has been trading within a tight US$25,000 to US$30,000 range and is in search of a story and \u201ca major Fed rate or language surprise this week could provide the impetus needed to break out.\u201d\n\nReflecting the current lacklustre trend, CoinMarketCap\u2019s fear and greed index, a measure of market buy and sell sentiment, fell further into neutral territory on Wednesday with a reading of 52.\n\nThe caution was reflected in digital asset investment products that saw net outflows of US$6.5 million in the week ending July 21, following four prior weeks of consecutive inflows that totaled US$742 million, according to a Monday report from European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares.\n\nTrading volumes in such investment products last week fell to US$1.2 billion, below the yearly average and down from US$2.4 billion the prior week, according to CoinShares. By regions, the U.S. and Canada saw 97% of the total outflows of US$21.7 million.\n\nBitcoin-backed investment products were the primary focus which saw US$13 million of outflows last week, while Ether-backed products logged an inflow of US$6.6 million, suggesting sentiment is improving around the second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nEther edged up 0.41% to US$1,857 in early trading in Asia on Wednesday, but remained 2.17% lower for the week.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Dogecoin, XRP, and Tron\u2019s TRX logging gains, while the rest declined. Polygon\u2019s Matic led the losers, falling 2.84% to US$0.7081 and down 4.12% for the week.\n\nDogecoin again headed the winners list on optimism it could become a feature in Twitter\u2019s rebranding to X.com, which will include functions such as \u201cpayments/banking,\u201d according to Twitter Chief Executive Officer Linda Yaccarino on Monday.\n\n\u201cDogecoin rallied recently as speculation increased that the meme coin could be used as a payment mechanism for the rebranded Twitter platform,\u201d said Markus Thielen, head of crypto research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cAs crypto is entering the summer lull that we initially expected for August, DOGE might be the summer\u2019s highflyer as other crypto themes are taking a backseat.\u201d\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.22% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume fell 27.41% to US$25.68 billion.\n\nForkast 500 dips, Axie Infinity developer to make NFT game with CyberKongz\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.60% in the past 24 hours to 2,642.91 as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 2.60% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon NFT market indexes also logged losses, while the Cardano index edged higher.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dipped 2.90% in the past 24 hours to US$17.77 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Polygon Solana and Bitcoin networks rose, while Ethereum, BNB Chain and Cardano logged losses\n\nBy NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) topped the 24-hour trading volumes, though total trades fell 39.79% to around US$695,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another slow day in the NFT market, with a majority of NFT trades still being wash trades, or sellers accepting points farmers offer on Blur,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nThe floor prices of leading Ethereum NFT collections Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) have dropped 18% and 25% in the past 30 days, while trading volumes in the two collections over the same period slumped 80% and 67% respectively, according to NFT data tracker WGMI.io.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing happening out there to make buyers want to buy NFTs at the prices they\u2019re at still. Really, they\u2019re massively overpriced even after declining over the year,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nYuga Labs, the developer of BAYC and MAYC, launched \u201cMade by Apes\u201d on Tuesday \u2013 a platform that grants BAYC and MAYC holders unique on-chain licences for their own products or services featuring the ape-themed NFTs.\n\nBAYC holders have already been building businesses around their collections, including fast food, clothing, and beverage operations, and more brands are using BAYC in promotions.\n\n\u201cDuring this bear market we are seeing actual utility begin to get fleshed out like with Yuga Labs\u2019 new fully on-chain IP licensing platform,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nElsewhere, Sky Mavis, the Vietnam-based developer behind play-to-earn NFT game Axie Infinity, announced a partnership with NFT project CyberKongz on Tuesday, where the two will jointly develop an NFT game based on CyberKongz\u2019s incoming Genkai NFT collection.\n\nU.S. equity futures stall ahead of Fed move\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell|Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday in Hong Kong, with Dow Jones and Nasdaq futures inching lower, while S&P 500 futures edged up.\n\nAll three major U.S. indexes closed higher in regular Tuesday trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average logging gains for the 12th consecutive day, extending its longest winning streak in six years.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes fell on Wednesday ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate announcement later today. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged losses.\n\nAlthough a China Politburo meeting on Monday pledged policies to support the country\u2019s ailing property market and revive domestic consumption, China\u2019s stock market requires imminent and actionable measures from the government, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday citing a note by U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe U.S. Fed announces its interest rate decision on Wednesday with analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predicting a 98.9% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike this month.\n\nWith a rise in rates mostly priced into markets, the focus of attention will be comments by Fed chair Jerome Powell on how the central bank views inflation trends, offering some pointers on future monetary policies.\n\nThe current Fed under Powell has raised rates 10 times since March 2022 to tackle inflation that was running at 40-year highs last year. The annual inflation rate has since fallen to 3% in June from more than 9% last year.\n\nHowever, with inflation still above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%, economists forecast more potential hikes this year based on recent comments by Powell.\n\nOn the economic data front, the U.S. consumer confidence index hit a two-year high in July, according to the U.S. think tank Conference Board on Tuesday, \u201clikely reflecting lower inflation and a tight labor market.\u201d\n\nThe consumer confidence index, together with data on inflation, the housing market and retail sales, contributed to the optimism that the U.S. economy could avoid a recession in 2023, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section, adds fear and greed index in first section.)"

        "title": "'Elegant and ass-backward': Jameson Lopp's first impression of Bitcoin - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Jameson Lopp has been on the front lines of the battle between technologists and those who want to preserve Bitcoin as it is since the scaling debates of 2015\u20132017.\n\nThe topic arouses such passion that many suspect it was a disgruntled Bitcoiner opponent who called down an armed SWAT team to his home, leading him to famously go underground.\n\nLopp blamed the 2017 incident on the \u201csame old same old: Bitcoin philosophy and scaling debate arguments. A few of the more extreme cases think I\u2019m some kind of manipulative monster.\u201d\n\nDear anonymous coward who just sent dozens of cops w/ rifles to my house w/a false hostage situation report: I am not so easily intimidated. \u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) October 16, 2017\n\nLopp, who is currently the chief technology officer for decentralized wallet service Casa, is an advocate for cautious progress who commands respect among the Bitcoin community.\n\nSpeaking from an undisclosed location, Lopp says he worries the backlash against Ordinals NFTs might result in lower support for much-needed future upgrades. Ordinals were largely an unexpected result of the 2021 Taproot soft fork.\n\n\u201cThe problem that I see is that there\u2019s a lot of ossification proponents out there. And they\u2019re pointing at Ordinals and inscriptions and saying, \u2018You see, this is what happens when you change the protocol. It gets abused and used in ways that were not intended,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nBut Lopp says the alternative is every bit as risky. He has carefully considered the problem of Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cossification\u201d \u2014 where the network becomes so big \u201cit kind of gets crushed under its own weight and unable to change itself.\u201d\n\nJameson Lopp enjoys a beer bought with Bitcoin. (Twitter)\n\nLopp uses email as an example of an internet protocol that ossified in the 1990s, leaving it with little ability to deal with the massive volumes of spam that subsequently arose.\n\nInstead, corporations constructed expensive centralized reputation services on top to sort out spam from legit emails, and today, large numbers of emails that don\u2019t comply with the arcane rules of the systems simply disappear into a black hole. And users are still deluged with spam.\n\n\u201cAs of today, something like 90% of all email users are captured by five corporations. So, I think we have to ask ourselves: Is that the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin that we want to see? And if not, then what do we need to do to prevent that?\u201d\n\nFor Lopp, scaling Bitcoin \u2014 something he\u2019s been agitating for, for years \u2014 remains the big challenge as the Lightning Network is \u201cnot going to fix everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you talk to any of the developers, who\u2019re pretty deep into the protocol, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find any of them who think that we should ossify the protocol now. There\u2019s so much work to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know how much time we have left to do that.\u201d\n\nHistorically, Lopp\u2019s company Casa has been solely focused on Bitcoin, but last month, it outraged puritans on social media by adding Ethereum to its multisignature self-custody solutions. It highlights the fact Bitcoin has a fast-growing challenger snapping at its heels if it lets up the pace.\n\nYou can take the Bitcoiner out of the south, but\u2026 (Twitter)\n\nWho is Jameson Lopp?\n\nLopp grew up in a \u201cfairly typical Southern American conservative household\u201d in North Carolina, where his father\u2019s side of the family has lived since the 1700s. It was clear from early on that he was super bright, and his parents pushed him hard to achieve great things at school.\n\n\n\n\u201cI read probably several grades above my reading level, and I read all the time. I had a special exemption at the library to check out more books than you are normally allowed to just because I was going through such a high volume of them.\u201d\n\nPlaced into high-level courses, he often wound up sitting on his own doing separate assignments from the rest of the class, something of a \u201csocial outcast.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the social side, I would just get even more awkwardness and sort of abuse because I would sometimes use vocabulary that nobody else was using, and they were like, you know, \u2018Who is this alien guy?\u2019\u201d\n\nLopp ended up joining Mensa in 2010, mainly to see if he could pass the test requiring an IQ in the top 2%. Naturally, he set up a Mensa Bitcoin special interest group, though he says super-smart people don\u2019t necessarily get Bitcoin any faster than anyone else and points to the dismissive reaction to Satoshi\u2019s original announcement about Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe people who were responding to that email were not stupid. They were incredibly intelligent people. But if you\u2019re intelligent enough, you can always find reasons why something won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nJack Dorsey is slowly transitioning into 2017 Jameson Lopp. pic.twitter.com/WpHRGq8kAm \u2014 Brad Mills \ud83d\udd11\u26a1\ufe0f (@bradmillscan) June 4, 2021\n\nComing of age\n\nAfter school, Lopp headed to study computer science at the \u201cvery liberal\u201d University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Brought up to be a very conservative Republican, he says university \u201cswung my perspective a little bit more outside of the sort of family and household standards that I had been used to.\u201d He ended up voting for Obama in 2008, Libertarian in the following election, and now believes he can have more impact building decentralized financial infrastructure than voting.\n\n\u201cThese days, I view politics at a very arm\u2019s length amused perspective.\u201d\n\nHe worked in email marketing for years in one of the tech areas near Raleigh, moving up from working on the web app to large-scale data analysis. Like most people in tech, he read about Bitcoin a few times and dismissed it as \u201cnerd money that was going to end badly\u201d before finally reading the white paper in 2012.\n\n\u201cI was just blown away,\u201d he says, noting that Satoshi approached the double-spending and Byzantine generals problem from the exact opposite direction of the \u201cperformance and efficiency\u201d mindset Lopp had been taught.\n\n\u201cWhen I read the white paper and I saw the solution to the problem, I was amazed because it was both elegant and ass-backward,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe solution was to make everything really, really expensive in terms of resource usage. I was like, wow, I never in a million years would have thought to try that because it just goes against our nature as computer scientists.\u201d\n\nSupplied image of Jameson Lopp.\n\nBitcoiners back then were primarily libertarians, cypherpunks and crypto-anarchists, and the chance to find an alternate way forward was part of the appeal.\n\n\u201cWe can build alternative power structures, alternative systems that don\u2019t rely upon any of the existing infrastructure. And basically, we can create our own rules for how these systems should operate.\u201d\n\nLopp forks Bitcoin Core\n\nWithin two years, Lopp had created a fork of Bitcoin Core called Statoshi to \u201cbring more transparency and understanding to the internal operations of a Bitcoin node.\u201d He applied for a grant from the Bitcoin Foundation to work full time on the project but never heard back. Five years later, he discovered he\u2019d been successful, but the foundation fell apart before he received any money.\n\nLopp also applied to work at Coinbase in 2015 and \u201cnever even got an interview,\u201d but his work on Statoshi did land him a gig running the nodes for institutional custody and infrastructure provider BitGo. He also began to nurture his public profile, ramping up his research and writing \u2014 he\u2019s written for CoinDesk, Cointelegraph and Forbes \u2014 tweeting more often, organizing Meetups and presenting at events. He\u2019s now a regular at conferences around the world, but it wasn\u2019t easy to start.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely an introvert, though you wouldn\u2019t know it because I do all of these public speaking events. But that took a lot of practice to do.\u201d\n\nLopp was happy to lob the occasion grenade during the scaling debates. (Twitter)\n\nLopp says the block size wars (2015\u20132017) was the period when he started to become really well-known in Bitcoiner circles. Initially, he was on the big blocks side, writing an article in 2015 calling for an increase in the 1MB size of blocks to increase capacity and suggesting blocks may one day hit 10GB. He also supported the Bitcoin XT fork of Bitcoin Core, which ended up part of Bitcoin Cash.\n\n\u201cThat was really a result of what I had been doing as an engineer for the past decade,\u201d he says, adding that he\u2019d spend much of each year prepping for the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales because \u201cif you couldn\u2019t handle that, then it would be a bad user experience, you would lose customers, you would lose money, and the business would not grow as quickly.\u201d He didn\u2019t want Bitcoin to lose potential users through a bad experience with the slow, expensive blockchain.\n\nHowever, his perspective started to change when he realized the impact bigger blocks would have on his own work at BitGo, writing services that talked to the nodes.\n\n\u201cI started to see the opposite side of the argument,\u201d he explains. \u201cEven with these \u2018tiny\u2019 1MB blocks, it was quite challenging for me to write services that could ingest all of this blockchain data at a very fast pace.\u201d\n\nIt took weeks sometimes to get a new indexing service up and running from scratch, and doubling or tripling the block size would require exponentially more resources \u201cto the point where only the largest enterprises who had a lot of money to throw at this problem would even be able to run the nodes and the services on top of them.\u201d\n\nSo, while Lopp ended up strongly supporting SegWit as a practical solution and thinks Bitcoin is superior to any other cryptocurrency as \u201csound money,\u201d he also sees room for experimentation on other protocols, and on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cA lot of people get very ideological and, in some cases, puritanical about this stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cBitcoin is not a kitchen sink type of protocol there. There\u2019s a lot of things that you can\u2019t do on Bitcoin that you can do with other protocols.\u201d\n\nSu Casa, mi Casa\n\nLopp joined the decentralized Bitcoin self-custody service Casa in 2018 and was soon promoted to chief technology officer. He also has the title of co-founder. Casa is an alternative to centralized custodians and offers a range of multisignature wallet plans that enable users to avoid losing their funds in security incidents and to recover lost or stolen keys.\n\nCasa began support for Ethereum last month and claims it\u2019s the first company to enable self-custody of both Bitcoin and Ether with up to five keys for distributed security. ERC-20 and NFT support is in the works.\n\n\u201cObviously, there were a few clients who fell into the sort of extreme Bitcoin-only camp who went their own way,\u201d says Lopp, adding that this was expected. \u201cReally, it\u2019s this loud, tiny minority that can seem a lot bigger than they are if you\u2019re on social media. But in reality, I would say most of our clients and most Bitcoiners, in general, are pretty moderate and kind of apathetic about all of the drama.\u201d\n\nHe says the decision resulted from user demand because many existing clients \u201cdo have more diverse portfolios, and they want to have that same level of security for assets other than Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCasa Co-founder and CTO, Jameson @lopp, explains how Casa multi-key vaults provide the highest level of security for everyday savers. pic.twitter.com/2CnWWLyUwZ \u2014 Casa (@CasaHODL) July 3, 2023\n\nThe loud, tiny minority goes SWATing\n\nThe famous SWATing incident happened after his views began to evolve. A 911 caller claimed to be holed up at Lopp\u2019s house with hostages, having already shot someone.\n\n\u201cBy my voice, you can tell I\u2019m not in a mental health state right now. I\u2019m on drugs. I\u2019m all over the place. I don\u2019t know what to do. [\u2026] If I don\u2019t get $60,000, I\u2019m going to blow the whole fucking block up.\u201d\n\nHeavily armed cops arrived at his home, guns drawn. Lopp wasn\u2019t home at the time and arrived to find his neighborhood shut down and crawling with dozens of patrol units, a SWAT team, a mobile command post, a fire truck and a paramedic. He had a conversation with a cop to find out what happened, not realizing he was the suspect.\n\nLopp recounts a chat with a cop on his blog. (Cypherpunk Cogitations)\n\n\n\nFollowing the incident, Lopp tweeted a video of himself firing off an AR-15 rifle as a warning to anyone trying to find him.\n\nBitcoin security pro tip: protect your software with hardware. pic.twitter.com/R4KeRGRcTP \u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) October 26, 2017\n\nThe incident also inspired Lopp\u2019s radical privacy experiment to live off the grid and off the radar of the authorities. Apart from standard stuff like using VPNs, private mailboxes and using fake names, it also involved setting up a bunch of limited liability companies to apply for bank accounts and credit cards one step removed. He mainly spent cash, used burner phone numbers and even bought \u201cthe crappiest, cheapest hole in the wall I could find that has a physical mailbox\u201d as a physical address to get a driver\u2019s license.\n\n\u201cI determined that the amount of effort and especially money that is required to do it is going to price almost everybody out of doing this,\u201d he says, adding the fact that you have to lie to everyone was also likely to deter people from trying it.\n\n\u201cEveryone in my physical proximity, my neighbors, they only know my pseudonym. And you know, I have my backstory, and I literally had to create this whole alternate persona, but not so different, it would be difficult for me to make it believable. So, like, I\u2019m still a software engineer who knows a lot about security.\u201d\n\nLopp maintains a GitHub list of \u201cknown physical Bitcoin attacks,\u201d which spans from Hal Finney getting SWATed in December 2014 to a couple in Queens, New York who were mugged in mid-July by assailants disguised as FBI agents who stole their car, $40,000 in cash and their crypto.\n\nThe No. 1 lesson to take from the list is that the fewer people who know they can rob you of your crypto by threatening you with a $5 wrench, the better. So it\u2019s interesting to learn that prior to his SWATing, Lopp used to drive around in a flashy Lotus Elise with a BITCOIN license plate, basically inviting attacks.\n\nAlthough many people thought it was a Lamborghini, Lopp says that \u201cit was actually a salvage title car that I got for $20,000.\u201d He eventually sold it, but he has the BITCOIN license plate hanging on the wall behind him during our interview as a memento. These days, Lopp drives \u201cextremely common vehicles that are mass-produced by the millions.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin number plate has been retired. (Twitter)\n\nFuture progress for Bitcoin\n\nPushing for progress on Bitcoin while not destroying all of the things Bitcoiners hold dear has always been a thorny problem. Roger \u201cBitcoin Jesus\u201d Ver couldn\u2019t solve it and went off with the Bitcoin Cash camp, who then split off with Craig \u201cNo, I really am Satoshi\u201d Wright heading up Bitcoin SV.\n\nThere are also Bitcoiners trying to change it from within, like Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer, who have embraced Ordinals. Wall is also investigating scaling Bitcoin using the same zero-knowledge proof technology being used to scale Ethereum via Starknet.\n\nLopp says he\u2019s focused on a variety of improvements that can be made to \u201clet people start building more outside of the base protocol.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go through the same onerous process to develop on a second layer, you don\u2019t have to make these sweeping consensus changes that are really risky,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why I want to see a lot more second layers other than just Lightning. I want to see more sidechains, drive chains, rollups, so on and so forth. Because I think that that is going to enable more innovation, more experimentation.\u201d"

        "title": "The Investigation of Larry and Gary Harmon and the Helix Mixer - Chainalysis Blog",
        "content": "Within the span of a few years, two brothers from Ohio were imprisoned for cryptocurrency-related crimes. The first, Larry Dean Harmon, was arrested and charged for a money laundering conspiracy arising from his operation of Helix, a cryptocurrency mixing service operating on the dark web. Shortly after Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) seized Larry\u2019s Bitcoin wallets, his younger brother, Gary James Harmon, used Larry\u2019s passwords to steal a portion of the Bitcoin back from the seized wallets. In April 2023, Gary was sentenced to four years in prison for his theft from the government.\n\nWe\u2019re proud to share that Chainalysis tools helped in the investigation of these cases. Below, we\u2019ll describe the Harmon brothers\u2019 criminal activities and how blockchain analysis helped authorities recover some of the stolen funds.\n\nLarry Harmon\u2019s money-laundering operations\n\nAs the founder and primary operator of Helix, Larry Harmon was involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem for several years. He was also the CEO of Coin Ninja, where Gary was employed, and founded DropBit, the company\u2019s mobile Bitcoin wallet.\n\nHelix was a Bitcoin mixer, and was often used to hide proceeds from drug trafficking and other activities on the dark web. Between 2014 and 2017, Helix processed more than 350,000 Bitcoin (worth approximately $300 million at the time) on behalf of users. Larry regularly promoted Helix to darknet market users and partnered with AlphaBay, Evolution, Agora Market, Nucleus, Dream Market, and other darknet markets to grow Helix\u2019s customer base. Larry also ran Grams, a darknet search engine linked to Helix. In Chainalysis Reactor, we can see the relationship between Helix and these darknet markets:\n\nThese activities quickly attracted the attention of IRS-CI and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In the early stages of the investigation, an undercover FBI agent transferred Bitcoin from an AlphaBay wallet to Helix and confirmed that using the mixer reduced direct traceability to AlphaBay. Then, law enforcement used Chainalysis to identify 16 Bitcoin wallets which contained nearly 5,000 Bitcoin worth of proceeds from Helix\u2019s operation. When law enforcement searched Larry\u2019s residences in Ohio and Belize, they recovered multiple cryptocurrency storage devices linked to these wallets, and also found an accounting spreadsheet in his Google Drive that indicated ownership of more than $56 million worth of Bitcoin and other assets.\n\nLarry was charged in February 2020 and pled guilty in 2021 to money laundering conspiracy. He also admitted to partnering with darknet market vendors to provide Bitcoin laundering services. Shortly after, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) ordered Larry to pay a $60 million civil penalty \u2014 the first of its kind for Bitcoin mixing activities. He forfeited 4,400 Bitcoin and IRS-CI took custody of his wallets.\n\nGary follows Larry\u2019s footsteps\n\nAfter Larry\u2019s arrest in 2020, Gary was laid off from Coin Ninja and struggled financially. Sensing an opportunity to acquire funds from his brother\u2019s 16 wallets in custody, Gary used Larry\u2019s passwords to access several of them and transferred 712 Bitcoin (worth more than $5 million at the time) to eight new wallets. We can see those transactions below in Reactor.\n\nOnce complete, Gary deposited 68 Bitcoin as collateral for a $1.2 million loan from BlockFi, which he used to purchase a luxury condo in Cleveland, Ohio, and spent at strip clubs and on private jets. The below image shows Gary in a bathtub with cash at a nightclub, which investigators recovered on his phone. Additionally, text messages on the phone suggest he made extravagant purchases around the same time.\n\nIn July 2021, Gary was arrested and federal agents searched his Ohio residence. They found wallets which contained approximately $6,000 in Bitcoin at the time. In addition to his four-year prison sentence, Gary was ordered to surrender $20 million in virtual currencies and other property. He pled guilty to wire fraud and obstruction of justice.\n\nTracking criminals on the blockchain\n\nAlthough criminals like the Harmon brothers continue to launder money using blockchain technology, law enforcement is able to use tools like Chainalysis Reactor and Storyline, and employ other sophisticated strategies to track and recover stolen funds.\n\nIn 2022, IRS-CI announced that it had seized $7 billion worth of digital assets in the previous year. This included a record $3.6 billion from two individuals accused of laundering funds stolen from the 2016 Bitfinex hack, and $3.36 billion recovered from a theft of Bitcoin from darknet market Silk Road. These numbers suggest a crucial difference between investigations involving fiat versus those with cryptocurrency; on the blockchain, everything is immutable and transparent, ensuring that law enforcement will always have trails to follow.\n\nThe 2023 Crypto Crime Report Available now!

        "content": "Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has confirmed he purchased a significant amount of Bitcoin (BTC) earlier this year \u2014 buying two BTC for each of his seven children.\n\nSpeaking in a July 26 Twitter Space, Kennedy said the decision came after he received \u201ca lot of criticism\u201d from crypto industry pundits and the mainstream press in the wake of his pro-Bitcoin comments made at the Bitcoin Miami Conference in May.\n\nKennedy said he was critiqued for promoting a \u201cvolatile commodity\u201d while not having any skin of his own in the game.\n\n\u201cRight after that Bitcoin conference I got a big check and I said, okay, you know, I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and so I bought two Bitcoin for every one of my seven children.\u201d\n\nKennedy has six biological children, four sons and two daughters ranging in age from 22 to 38.\n\nPresumably, the seventh child comes from Kennedy\u2019s most recent marriage to actress Cheryl Hines, who had one daughter before the pair married in 2014.\n\nBREAKING: Democrat Presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. announces that he is a #Bitcoin holder. \u2014 Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) July 26, 2023\n\nAt the time of his speech at the conference \u2014 where he also announced that he would begin accepting campaign donations in Bitcoin \u2014 the candidate denied having any personal investment in the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cI am not an investor, and I am not here to give investment advice,\u201d he said.\n\nThis marks the first time that Kennedy has admitted to owning the cryptocurrency, and lines up with a leaked financial disclosure that revealed the candidate had\u201cbetween $100,001 and $250,000\u201d worth of Bitcoin at the end of June.\n\nHowever, if RFK Jr. had purchased a total of 14 Bitcoin for an approximate price of $26,800 in the days following the end of the conference, his total holdings at the end of June would\u2019ve surpassed $380,000.\n\nRelated: RFK Jr. elaborates position on CBDC, crypto: \u2018It isn\u2019t just criminals who want privacy\u2019\n\nAt the time of publication, the price of Bitcoin stands at $29,327, according to Cointelegraph price data, meaning that Kennedy\u2019s investment is now worth a total of $410,000.\n\nIn the interview, Kennedy reaffirmed his plan to back the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin as well as making the asset exempt from capital gains taxes if elected President.\n\nThis kind of thing partly explains the appeal of Bitcoin. Our freedom to transact and save should not be at the mercy of political enforcers. No payment platform should be allowed to discriminate against people for exercising their right to free speech. \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) July 26, 2023\n\nSaying that he sees Bitcoin as a vehicle for returning innovation to America, he added that any capital gains exemptions on Bitcoin conversions should only apply to smaller investors and businesses, as not to create huge windfalls for large companies like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nOpinion: GOP crypto maxis almost as bad as Dems\u2019 \u2018anti-crypto army\u2019"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether edge up after Fed raises interest rates as expected; Solana leads winners - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin gained Thursday morning in Asia, but not enough to break through resistance at US$29,500 after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by the expected quarter point. The bank left the door open for another increase in September. Ether moved higher with most top 10 cryptocurrencies. Solana led the winners as its trading volume more than doubled in the past 24 hours. Dogecoin led the losers as the meme token lost some steam after gaining over 11% for the week. The Forkast 500 NFT index traded flat and U.S. equity futures were mixed, reflecting the same performance on Wall Street on Wednesday.\n\nTop cryptos gain\n\nBitcoin rose 0.90% in the last 24 hours to US$29,459 as of 07:15 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still down 1.37% for the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency briefly breached US$29,600 early Thursday morning.\n\nEther moved up 0.88% to US$1,874, but remained 0.68% lower for the seven-day period.\n\nThe marginal gains followed the Fed\u2019s decision to raise benchmark lending rates in the U.S. to between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest in 22 years, to slow inflation. In a press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said another rate hike in September is possible, but said decisions will be determined by the data at the time.\n\n\u201cAn interesting time for crypto markets although you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell when looking at the price action. With macro markets timidly risk-on, BTC and ETH rose slightly to recoup levels lost earlier this week,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\nWith the exception of Dogecoin, all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher in the past 24 hours.\n\nSolana\u2019s SOL led the winners, jumping 9.51% to US$25.35, but still sitting on a 3.80% loss for the full week. The token\u2019s 24-hour trading volume surged more than 100% to over US$682 million, surpassing that of Ether and indicating investors are betting on a strong rebound.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cSOL\u2019s price increased by about 49% in the past month, primarily driven by the stable development and progress of Solana\u2019s blockchain and ecosystem, with steady growth in user base and restoration of reputation,\u201d said Greta Yuan, head of research at Hong Kong-based digital asset exchange VDX.\n\nDogecoin lost ground after being the darling of the week as the rebranding of Twitter raised speculation it could be part of a payments system on the social media network. It fell 3.52% to US$0.0784, though is still holding a weekly gain of 11.82%.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 0.85% in the past 24 hours to US$1.19 trillion, while trading volume rose 20.51% to US$30.91 billion.\n\nElsewhere, Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency and digital identity project founded by OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman, issued its controversial WLD token on Monday and prices soared. The token dipped 1.49% to US$2.28 on Thursday, but is up 36.30% since the launch.\n\n\u201cOpenAI co-founder Sam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin project might just be one of the most ambitious cryptocurrency projects in recent years,\u201d Louis Schoeman, managing director at Dubai-based trading information platform Forex Suggest, said in emailed comments.\n\n\u201cThe project\u2019s core offering, its World ID, requires users to prove via an iris scan that they are human, and not an AI bot. Those who sign up will receive Worldcoin\u2019s cryptocurrency token WLD,\u201d said Schoeman.\n\n\u201cThis sort of digital ID will be necessary in the development of AI, in order to tell the difference between humans and AI bots online. It\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish fiction from reality, which is a particular concern in the financial and democratic systems. Worldcoin wants to defend people from AI misinformation and make it clear who and what to trust online,\u201d added Schoeman.\n\nIn emailed comments on Worldcoin, Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at the U.S.-based crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, said: \u201cThe value of a real non-transferable, and cryptographically secure identity is potent as it could reduce digital fraud, help bank the unbanked, and even reduce the number of times I have to convince robots I\u2019m not a robot a day.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, the Worldcoin project signed up more than two million users during beta testing and is now expanding operations to 35 cities across 20 countries, but the US isn\u2019t yet one of them, said Schoeman.\n\n\u201cAltman made it clear the company didn\u2019t feel the US would make or break the project, but with North America said to account for around 18% of the total world crypto value received, breaking into the US market will be a major concern for Worldcoin,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA global digital ID enabling private identity verifications is undeniably revolutionary, however, it\u2019s certain to stir up controversy, with many already calling the exchange of biometric data for crypto tokens an outlandish bribe,\u201d said Schoeman.\n\nForkast 500 flat, Sotheby\u2019s NFT auction sells out\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up a slight 0.57% in the past 24 hours to 2,651.39 as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. It\u2019s still down 2.22% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana, Polygon and Cardano NFT market indexes all logged losses.\n\nWhile the overall NFT market remains in the doldrums, auction house Sotheby\u2019s NFT art collections are attracting buyers of so-called generative art, or the process of algorithmically generating art forms.\n\nThemes and Variations, an NFT collection of 500 generative artworks by artist Vera Moln\u00e1r, was sold out within an hour in a Dutch auction on Wednesday for 631 ETH (US$1.2 million). It is the first collection in Sotheby\u2019s Gen Art Program, which aims to spotlight three generative artists each year.\n\nWith secondary markets included, the trading volume of Themes and Variations has totaled over US$2 million, according to data from CryptoSlam, making it the top NFT collection by that measure in the past 24 hours.\n\n\u201cIn the future we\u2019re going to look back at this time in NFTs as a very special time for generative art,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs. \u201cArt is still the best use case for NFTs, and it\u2019s exciting to see so many collectors appreciating it even in a market like this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting to see a rather steady stream of higher-end generative art from Sotheby\u2019s, whose new generative art platform is using the Art Blocks Engine to produce these on-chain works,\u201d added Petscher.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dropped 5.16% in the past 24 hours to US$18.41 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Polygon, Bitcoin and Cardano blockchains fell, while Solana, Mythos Chain and Immutable X saw an increase in trading.\n\n\u201cMythos Chain and ImmutableX are also up 47% and 69%, showing yet again that gaming NFTs (from Gods Unchained, CS:GO, TF2, DOTA 2) are another perfect use case for NFTs,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nElsewhere, social media platform Reddit launched the latest series of its NFT collectible avatars on early Thursday.\n\nEntitled \u201cRetro Reimagined\u201d, the collection features designs from both independent artists and NFT developers like Cool Cats.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Wednesday to extend its longest winning streak in six years, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite logged losses.\n\nAs analysts expected, the Federal Reserve announced a 25-basis-point rate hike on Wednesday in its more than year-long quest to reduce the inflation rate. The benchmark rate is now in the range of 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest since January 2001.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes rose after the Fed\u2019s rate rise was in line with expectations. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged gains.\n\nIn a press conference following the Fed announcement, the chair Jerome Powell said his agency will keep focused on economic data for future discussions on rate adjustments, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.\n\nThe Fed typically has eight monthly meetings a year to decide on interest rates, with the next two-day gathering scheduled for September 19-20.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting, based on the totality of incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the balance of risks,\u201d said Powell in his statement.\n\nHe said the Fed remains committed to bringing the annual inflation rate to its long-term goal of 2%. The annual inflation rate in June sat at 3.0%.\n\nOn the U.S. economic data front, investors have Thursday\u2019s report on gross domestic product (GDP) for the second quarter, and Friday\u2019s personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index for additional insights into the state of the economy and inflation.\n\nAmazon, MasterCard and McDonald\u2019s are also set to release their second-quarter earnings on Thursday.\n\n(Updates with comment on Solana in first section.)"

        "content": "A Reddit user has become the latest example of why crypto users should be more careful when using wallet generators after the user lost a few thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) from their \u201csecure\u201d paper wallet.\n\nOn July 24, a Reddit user, r/jdmcnair, posted on the r/Bitcoin subreddit, asking for an explanation on how a hacker could have been able to steal over $3,000 worth of Bitcoin from their supposedly secure paper wallet \u2014 which was even generated on an offline computer.\n\nThe Redditor's Bitcoin wallet address shows an outgoing transaction of 0.12 BTC. Source: Blockchain.com\n\n\u201cI was doing self-custody, generated my key and printed it on paper on an offline computer, transferred my BTC to this offline wallet, and kept it stored in a safe that only I have the key for,\u201d the user wrote.\n\n\u201cI thought I was keeping it in one of the more secure ways possible.\u201d\n\nIn an update to his initial post, the Redditor revealed that they used the wallet creation tool walletgenerator.net to create their wallet\u2019s private keys, which some users highlighted have been infamous for vulnerabilities in the past.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, blockchain security firm CertiK\u2019s director of security operations Hugh Brooks said users should think twice before using a crypto wallet generator.\n\nSuch online wallet generators have served as a viable hacking tool for a while now, Brooks said:\n\n\u201cSome of these wallet generators could be straight-up scams. The website that the post claims returns an IP address in Russia. When looking at a tool such as Criminal IP, we can see that the address has several abuse reports filed against it.\u201d\n\nPaper wallet generators have been known to contain serious vulnerabilities since 2019, Brooks said, adding that if anyone has generated wallets using walletgenerator.net, it\u2019s likely \u201cthe same keys have been given to different users.\u201d\n\nThe Profanity wallet generator exploit was a textbook example of this security vulnerability which led to the $160 million hack on algorithmic market maker Wintermute in September 2022.\n\nThe solution is simple, according to Brooks. Users wanting safe crypto storage should use a \u201ctrusted hardware wallet provider such as Ledger and Trezor.\u201d\n\nRelated: Almost $1M in crypto stolen from vanity address exploit\n\nThe Redditor was baffled as to why the exploiter waited over 12 months to exploit the funds, prompting another to offer a possible explanation.\n\n\u201c[The hackers] wait for enough noobs to think they generated secure private keys, wait for them to deposit significant amounts, and then, one day, swipe all the funds, so there is no time to react to reports of the site being compromised.\u201d\n\nWith a sudden increase in long-dormant Bitcoin wallets waking up \u2014 many with funds in the millions \u2014 some pundits think it\u2019s due to wallet generators being hacked.\n\nUnpopular crypto opinion: the fact that wallet generators can be cracked and people can lose their funds with no recourse is terrifying.

        "content": "Share:\n\nBitcoin halving cycle is due in 2024, only a few months out to April or May 2024.\n\nWhile traders anticipate the cycle, miners are disconcerted.\n\nThe event, which may kickstart the next bullish phase for BTC, could have devastating implications for miners.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) halving is a narrative that cryptocurrency traders and investors highly anticipated because of its characteristic ability to kickstart a new phase of bullish momentum for the flagship crypto, surpassing the peak prices recorded in the previous cycle to record a new all-time high.\n\nAlso Read: XRP retail holders made biggest winners from Torres' decision, technology policy expert says\n\nBitcoin halving countdown continues\n\nBitcoin (BTC) halving countdown continues, around eight months out, but traders and investors alike remain on the edge of their seats waiting to see what the new cycle will achieve. In every cycle that has passed, the event brings a fresh start to the yearlong bullish market, with Bitcoin price recording a new all-time high, preceding another yearlong bear market.\n\nThe bear market is followed by a two-year recovery period as the price attempts to reclaim the all-time high. This is where the BTC market currently stands, and investors cannot wait.\n\nBitcoin Halving Cycle\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Halving?\n\nBitcoin halving is an event where the rewards for mining BTC tokens are cut in half. With every cycle, the impact of individual halving events continues to diminish as the block reward procedurally edges toward zero. The objective of a halving activity is to slow down the rate of generating new coins, thereby lowering the available amount of tokens in supply.\n\nThe previous Bitcoin halving event occurred on May 11, 2020, with the next one slated between April and May 2023. The final one is estimated for 2140, 117 years ahead. This estimate is based on the calculation that by this time, the number of BTC tokens in circulation will have attained the maximum supply of 21 million. The current circulating supply is 19,440,787 BTC, based on CoinMarketCap data.\n\nWhile traders anticipate the 2024 Bitcoin halving and its expected impact to pump BTC price, miners do not share in the same sentiment. On the contrary, BTC miners and mining companies' are feeling unsettled.\n\nThe miners, serving as validators to secure the network and process transactions, receive incentives to keep the operation running. These incentives are called block rewards. Specifically, by mining a single BTC token, the miner adds one block to the blockchain. The incentive for this single block is 6.25 Bitcoin tokens. Based on current rates ($29,210), this is approximately $182,562.\n\nPost-halving, miners will receive 3.125 Bitcoin tokens (half of 6.25) for every successful block added to the blockchain. This translates to about $91,281. The drop in mining rewards is part of the reasons why miners are fretting over the oncoming event, as it means their revenue source will suffer a 50% slash.\n\nWhy BTC miners are disconcerted over Bitcoin halving\n\nIt makes sense for a trader or investor to assume that a 50% slash in mining rewards is a reasonable sacrifice considering the event in itself serves to increase the value of Bitcoin. This means that even the 3.125 block reward could account for more than the rewards when incentives added up to 6.25 BTC tokens.\n\nHowever, from a miner or mining company's standpoint, it is a stark value loss, considering the operating expenses required to mine Bitcoin. The infrastructure required to mine Bitcoin has increased in price over time, with mining equipment costing more now, electricity rates going higher, and the fact that there are deliberations for a 30% mining tax to be imposed on miners in the US specifically.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin's hash power, the power that a computer or hardware uses to run and solve different hashing algorithms, is mostly concentrated in the US.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin price heedless as institutions that know markets better than anybody wager on BTC mining"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAs the race for the White House heats up, Democratic candidate for U.S. president Robert Kennedy Jr, has come out as a proponent of Bitcoin, and says he has proven that commitment by buying 14 Bitcoin last May.\n\nIn a Wednesday Twitter Spaces interview with crypto investor and podcaster Scott Melker, Kennedy called Bitcoin the currency of freedom, and said he decided to become a crypto investor after he was chided by media outlets for promoting Bitcoin but didn\u2019t own any.\n\n\u201cI bought two Bitcoin for each of my seven children,\u201d Kennedy said, noting he made the move \"right after\" his appearance at the Bitcoin Conference in May. \u201cNow I\u2019m a Bitcoin owner, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll now find a different way to come at me, but no one can say I didn\u2019t put my money where my mouth is.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKennedy and Melker also discussed how banks can shut down customer bank accounts without warning, and suggested political pressure may be behind the closure of the bank account of Joseph Mercola, described by the New York Times as \"the most influential spreader of coronavirus misinformation online.\"\n\nChase bank has shut down our business bank accounts along with the accounts of my CEO and CFO, as well as their family members (including spouse and child). They've refused to provide any reason for doing so, the oldest account has been active for 18 years.\u2026 \u2014 Dr. Joseph Mercola (@mercola) July 25, 2023\n\n\"Here we have a powerful banking interest that that has received all kinds of federal government support and it's utterly dependent on its on its relationship with the Fed and the federal government and it is shutting down one of its customers for political speech,\" Kennedy said. \"I think that incident alone should be one that all of us should be terrified about, and and it makes the the move toward Bitcoin, all the more important.\"\n\nDuring the annual conference held in Miami, Florida, Kennedy said covid-19 restriction led him to Bitcoin, and he claimed to be the first presidential candidate to accept Bitcoin donations through the Lightning Network. But he also said that he didn't own any, and wasn't there to give investment advice.\n\nCurrently, the price of a Bitcoin is $29,330 per coin, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of his speech at Bitcoin 2023, the price of a Bitcoin stood around $27,128. If Kennedy\u2019s claims are true, the Kennedy Bitcoin treasury would be worth around $400,000 today.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this month, a financial disclosure document obtained by CNBC showed Kennedy\u2019s Family held (at the time) between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of Bitcoin.\n\nHis conference address established his strong alignment with so-called digital gold.\n\n\u201cWhen I witnessed this cataclysm\u2014this devastating use of government repression\u2014I realized for the first time how free money is as important to freedom as free expression,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nKennedy added that the many environmental claims about Bitcoin are unfounded.\n\n\u201cI believe that the environmental arguments against Bitcoin are a smokescreen to obscure the real motives for suppressing Bitcoin,\u201d he said, citing the massive cost of endless wars and environmentally destructive projects.\n\nWhile Kennedy is not expected to win the Democratic party's nomination\u2014online wagering sites put his odds at around 11 percent\u2014he has drawn the support of fervent crypto fans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy for the support I\u2019ve gotten from the Bitcoin community,\u201d Kennedy said."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF race is on, and Wall Street behemoths like BlackRock and Fidelity are now battling for the title of first to offer a spot market product. But the winner will end up sharing that title with the partner that helps get it over the finish line.\n\nThat company could be Coinbase.\n\nWhen BlackRock announced it was stepping into the ring with its own spot Bitcoin ETF offering on June 15, it did so together with Coinbase. The $8.5 trillion asset manager designated the San Francisco-based crypto exchange as custodian for the fund\u2019s Bitcoin and later revised its filing to say Coinbase would also provide surveillance-sharing services, which allows the two to share information about trading, clearing activity, and customer identification to reduce the risks of market manipulation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Coinbase will likely be the go-to exchange in this regard,\" Bob Ras, co-founder of the asset-tokenization firm Sologenic, told Decrypt. \"Clearly, the big players regard Coinbase as a legitimate and critically important institution here.\"\n\nBlackRock wasn\u2019t the only Bitcoin ETF hopeful to turn to Coinbase to help shepherd its application with the SEC along. All five of the spot ETF Bitcoin applicants working with the Chicago Board of Exchange\u2014Fidelity, VanEck, Ark Invest\u2019s 21Shares, Valkyrie, and Invesco\u2014submitted revised applications that named Coinbase their surveillance partner of choice.\n\nThis parade of partnerships comes not long after the Securities and Exchange Commission hit Coinbase with a lawsuit accusing it of operating an unregistered securities exchange and dealing in unregistered securities through its staking service Coinbase Earn. The company rejects the charges, but the lawsuit has left a dark cloud over its head.\n\nYet with BlackRock and others seemingly shrugging off the SEC's charges, the vote of confidence appears to be validating Coinbase's approach to doing business. Several industry insiders told Decrypt that it was at best unclear what impact the SEC\u2019s lawsuit would have on its recent deals, but expressed doubt that the allegations\u2014even if they\u2019re found to be credible\u2014would affect Coinbase\u2019s ability to help launch an ETF.\n\nJoshua Frank, CEO of The Tie, an information service company for digital assets, said that Coinbase took \"a lot of shit\" for exercising a more cautious way of conducting business than some of its peers in recent years. The ETF deals, he said, show that Coinbase's more deliberate approach is paying off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI have 200 institutional clients, many in [traditional finance], who I speak to everyday, and every single institution I've ever spoken to is comfortable with Coinbase as a partner,\" Frank told Decrypt.\n\nThis confidence has also been good for Coinbase's stock value. On the heels of the BlackRock filing, Coinbase\u2019s stock began to steadily climb from $54 a share before surging ahead to $107 on July 13 after a federal judge ruled favorably against the SEC in its lawsuit against Ripple, finding that its XRP token was not a security except in certain transactions.\n\nThe stock last closed at about $98 a share at the time of writing, still above its place from when the SEC sued Coinbase on June 6.\n\nThis trust factor is also important at a time when more TradFi firms are showing an interest in wading deeper into crypto. Jeffrey Blockinger, the chief legal counsel at decentralized exchange Vertex Protocol, said that contacts in the world of traditional finance have expressed to him an interest in Bitcoin, but often have \"no interest\" in figuring out the technical side of handling their digital assets.\n\nThis is especially relevant given the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX last year. Authorities allege that the company founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, who now faces several criminal charges, mixed customer and corporate funds. The SEC alleged in a lawsuit filed on June 5 against Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by volume, that it too may be commingling customer funds.\n\nFor its part, Coinbase has said that it works to keep the separation of client and corporate funds intact. In an earlier interview with Decrypt, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal endorsed regulations in crypto to formalize that boundary.\n\nBlockinger said it was unlikely that BlackRock, Fidelity, or the other TradFi giants with their large due diligence teams would be inking deals with Coinbase if they felt their clients\u2019 assets would be at risk. \"They have a lot to lose,\" Blockinger told Decrypt. \"I think that they've gotten themselves comfortable with this institution that they feel they can do business with.\u201d\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that BlackRock invested $24 million in FTX. And for all the enthusiasm felt towards Coinbase between the Ripple decision and ETF deals, the threat of the SEC still looms large in the shadow of the company's recent rally.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMuch of the lift behind Coinbase's stock came from the rally in Bitcoin's price that followed the ETF deals though it has cooled recently. In an analysis included in BlackRock\u2019s ETF filing, Nasdaq estimates that 56% of the $129 billion in U.S.-based Bitcoin trading took place on Coinbase, where Bitcoin to U.S. dollar transactions are its highest volume trading pair, according to CoinGecko.\n\nDespite the spike in optimism from Coinbase after the Ripple decision, analysts at Berenberg Capital Markets caution that the celebration may be premature, and that the SEC\u2019s case posed fundamental problems for it.\n\nUnlike Ripple, Coinbase is being sued for offering unregistered securities through its staking service, something Coinbase is refuting. However, Berenberg analysts caution that the service, which lets users earn interest from Coinbase by staking their tokens, may fall outside the parameters set by the Ripple ruling.\n\nIn a July 17 research note, the Berenberg analysts warn that if the SEC or state regulators succeed in curtailing Coinbase's staking activities, it has the capacity to cut deeply into the company\u2019s financial condition by hitting the trading volumes it relies on so much.\n\nFrank from The Tie offered a broader warning for the industry. Though he praised Coinbase for running a trustworthy business, Frank noted that the market\u2019s reliance on Coinbase to fulfill so many roles \u2014from crypto custodian to exchange\u2014 is an unhealthy place to be. Pointing to the meltdown that followed FTX's collapse, Frank said it would be healthier for the market to grow more players than rely so heavily on any single firm.\n\n\"I think at the end of the day, we need more Coinbases,\" Frank told Decrypt. \"We need more if we want institutions to come on and ramp up for crypto. One isn't sufficient.\""

This means that the demand for charging points that support Bitcoin should follow as well."

Over the past three years, use cases for public blockchains have matured, allowing developers to create mainstream applications which enable new forms of value exchange with decentralized finance (DeFi), consumer engagement and loyalty platforms using non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and efficient payments with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and collateralized stablecoins. However, the emerging state of public blockchain tooling forces developers to spend time on undifferentiated work such as node operations and indexing data, instead of building value-added user experiences.\n\nAt a high level, there are three complex but undifferentiated tasks developers face with blockchain today:\n\nDevelopers must maintain specialized blockchain servers, known as nodes, in order to submit transactions or read the latest state of the blockchain. Developers have to keep up with a stream of node software updates through a labor-intensive process or risk losing the transactions they send to the blockchain. Scaling the node infrastructure with application usage also introduces operational risks. For example, new nodes can take days and multiple tries to sync with the blockchain before they can be used.\n\nDevelopers must maintain nodes for multiple blockchains to provide users with access to popular applications and cryptocurrencies on blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This further complicates the developer task, because each blockchain has its own language, hardware requirement, and software upgrade cycle to manage.\n\nDevelopers must transform raw blockchain data into formats that can be easily accessed by their applications to provide richer analytics for blockchain data, such as wallet balances and descriptions of NFTs. This is difficult because developers have to download terabytes of data from special archive nodes, standardize raw blockchain data with complex transformations, call smart contracts to get information such as token symbols, and store the data in application databases for fast querying. In addition, developers have to write special logic to handle historical data updates from the blockchain while new information continues to stream in.\n\nCapabilities of AMB Access and Query\n\nTo help blockchain developers with their undifferentiated tasks, we prioritized simplifying access to the foundational blockchain infrastructure and data components with these capabilities:\n\nServerless access \u2013 AMB Access extends the existing dedicated node offerings from AMB with serverless, scalable, and secure access to blockchain networks. AMB Access makes it even simpler for developers with instant availability to standard RPCs, removing the undifferentiated effort to configure dedicated infrastructure for blockchain resiliency and scalability, maintain blockchain nodes, or patch blockchain server software. In response to the institutional and retail demand our customers are seeing, AMB Access will support Bitcoin as its first serverless blockchain network through non-mining, full Bitcoin Core nodes. Our dedicated node offerings will continue to be available for customers who need a more hands-on approach to meet their resiliency and compliance requirements.\n\n\u2013 AMB Access extends the existing dedicated node offerings from AMB with serverless, scalable, and secure access to blockchain networks.

Multiple blockchains \u2013 AMB Access and Query provide access to the most popular blockchains in one place, starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum. With the addition of Bitcoin, AMB introduces the ease and instant availability of serverless APIs to complement its dedicated managed public blockchain offering for Ethereum. We will continue to listen to our customers for additional blockchains to support with AMB Access.\n\n\u2013 AMB Access and Query provide access to the most popular blockchains in one place, starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Straightforward data access \u2013 AMB Query will provide common application APIs to make data from multiple blockchains quickly available with response times that can meet the needs of interactive consumer applications. The complicated infrastructure setups, data transformation processes, and query statements required to provide common application requests, such as getting the wallet balance of all cryptocurrencies for the supported blockchains, are abstracted behind simple API calls.\n\n\u2013 AMB Query will provide common application APIs to make data from multiple blockchains quickly available with response times that can meet the needs of interactive consumer applications. The complicated infrastructure setups, data transformation processes, and query statements required to provide common application requests, such as getting the wallet balance of all cryptocurrencies for the supported blockchains, are abstracted behind simple API calls. Predictable pricing \u2013 AMB Access and Query provide a simple and transparent pay-as-you go pricing structure charged per remote procedure call (RPC) or API call. There is no utilization minimum and no need to translate abstract units into dollar costs.\n\nGeneral availability features\n\nAMB Access and Query offer the following features in our initial release:\n\nAMB Access for Bitcoin \u2013 Developers can connect to mainnet as well as testnet non-mining full Bitcoin Core nodes to access 28 commonly used JSON RPCs from the Bitcoin Core Client. AMB Access is available over the internet via the public endpoints or privately from their virtual private cloud (VPC) using AWS Private Link. Refer to our documentation for additional details. AMB Query for Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2013 Developers can access commonly requested on-chain current and historical data for address token balances and transaction history. With AMB Query\u2019s six initial APIs, developers can get data from Bitcoin and Ethereum mainnet in a standardized format. Refer to our documentation for additional details.\n\nUse cases\n\nAs foundational components, AMB Access and Query can help developers with every public blockchain use case. The following are two examples:\n\nCustodians and wallets \u2013 These applications can be considered the Web3 equivalent of traditional banking applications. Users of these applications expect similar experiences to their traditional banking applications, such as having their current and historical balances as well as transactions available at their fingertips. Regardless of whether they are centralized and operated by licensed operators or decentralized and self-managed by individual consumers, these applications serve the same basic purposes to store and transfer cryptocurrencies. While developers would still have to manage their own security to store cryptocurrencies, developers can have their applications interact with the blockchain RPCs through AMB Access so to transfer cryptocurrencies and read data from the blockchain quickly with AMB Query to display in the application.\n\n\u2013 These applications can be considered the Web3 equivalent of traditional banking applications.

Consumer engagement \u2013 The use of NFTs as a way to connect and increase engagement with consumers by enterprises such as Nike and Starbucks continues to grow. These NFTs serve as gating tokens that unlock exclusive benefits for the holders (such as access to real-world events), which can be used to incentivize specific actions (such as purchasing physical goods), and increase collaboration across brands (such as unlocking in-game digital goods from a popular brand). To enable these actions, applications must create, manage, and transfer NFTs using the RPCs on AMB Access, as well as quickly check ownership information with AMB Query. For example, to unlock an exclusive NFT for high-value customers, an application may need to check user wallets for ownership of an existing NFT issued on Ethereum and have holdings of greater than 1 BTC on Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cAmazon Managed Blockchain Access and Query provide friction-free access to blockchain networks and their data so developers can easily create their Web3 applications,\u201d said Saman Michael Far, VP of Financial Services Technology, AWS. \u201cI expect this easy to incorporate functionality will enable new mainstream applications ranging from interacting with digital assets to creating new ways of engaging consumers and their brands.\u201d\n\nAMB Access and Query are being used today by leading institutions for their digital initiatives.\n\n\u201cBrazil is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing cryptocurrency markets, with interest from the retail sector and among institutions, as well as supportive regulation from our government. Ita\u00fa is at the forefront of meeting this need as a trusted, and regulated entity, with a comprehensive cryptocurrency initiative. By using AMB Access we have accelerated our time to market by months which holds great strategic significance for Ita\u00fa\u2019s continued leadership across multiple businesses within a rapidly evolving market. Further, we are able to focus on delivering innovative products with the assurance of AMB\u2019s scalability, security, and reliability supporting our efforts. After seeing the benefits of AMB Access, we are looking at AMB Query to help us more quickly get the critical balance and transaction information that is stored on the blockchain.\u201d \u2013 Caio Cesar Lopes Gomes, CIO of Ita\u00fa digital\n\nSummary\n\nAMB Access and Query demonstrate the ongoing investment of AWS to help our customers in the growing Web3 and blockchain industry. Our initial offerings address the most common needs of customers for their foundational components with the performance, scalability, security, and reliability they expect. This foundation allows us to keep releasing new features regularly that simplify access to blockchain technology for enterprises and startups.\n\nAMB Access and Query can be accessed by customers using the AWS SDK, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS Management Console, or REST APIs. To get started, refer to our AMB Access and AMB Query product pages. The existing dedicated AMB services for Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum will be available under AMB Access.\n\nWe will explore in more detail the use cases and capabilities of AMB Access and Query in our upcoming deep-dive series.\n\nAbout the authors\n\nJohn Liu is the Head of Product for Web3 / Blockchain at AWS.

        "title": "Journeys: Herv\u00e9 Larren on Bitcoin, Apes and the psychology of 'blue-chip' NFTs - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "During a period of hyperinflation in 2013, \u201cmy Venezuelan mother asked me to send money to Caracas, the country\u2019s capital,\u201d Herv\u00e9 Larren recalls. However, bank transfers were not possible between the two countries.\n\nBusy with work in New York, he told a friend that he planned to fly to Caracas \u2014 carrying cash for his mother \u2014 and return the same day. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just send Bitcoin?\u201d his friend asked, which quickly led to a change of plans as Larren made his first Bitcoin transfer.\n\n\u201cMy first crypto transaction, in 2013, was to wire Bitcoin from the U.S. to Venezuela. Due to the economic collapse, there was no functioning banking system between these two countries.\u201d\n\nSwitching from a career with luxury goods company LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Larren co-founded a large-scale crypto mining operation and worked with Grayscale to bring crypto assets to old-school investors. He later became a key adviser to ApeCoin and the first person to bid a million dollars for a nonfungible token.\n\nFrom old to new\n\n\u201cWe were reporting to Nicolas Sarkozy, and he was coming to our meetings,\u201d Larren recalls of his time as the head of a high school student council in Neuilly-sur-Seine, the wealthiest old-money suburb of Paris, where he grew up.\n\nSarkozy served as the local mayor for 20 years before becoming the president of France. Larren\u2019s mother \u2014 from Venezuela \u2014 was a TV host and the first Latina model signed by the L\u2019Oreal cosmetics brand. His French father imported wine to Canada, where a third of the population is French-speaking.\n\nIn the late 90s, Larren began undergraduate business studies at Montreal\u2019s Concordia University. In 2019, Concordia labeled him \u201cThe Blockchain Maven\u201d as part of a \u201c50 Under 50\u201d alumni distinction. Upon graduation, he got a job at Mo\u00ebt Hennessy\u2019s New York office, where he worked on brand development of the firm\u2019s Hennessy cognac brand in the United States.\n\nLarren worked on his MBA at Columbia University part time while at LVMH, graduating in 2010 and entering the venture capital world with Peak Ventures, which \u201cwas involved in tech companies including Twitter.\u201d It was Larren\u2019s first experience in the technology sector, which he describes as very different from the old-world, intergenerational luxury goods industry.\n\nLarren quickly moved to accept Bitcoin at an e-commerce business he was involved with, a company that helped charities raise money by partnering with celebrities. In 2015, he formed crypto mining firm Global Crypto Ventures, which grew into an operation of nearly 3,000 machines composed primarily of Bitmain Antminer S9 miners in Las Vegas and Texas, where \u201cthe cost of infrastructure and electricity was cheaper.\u201d\n\nLarren at his mining facility. (Herv\u00e9 Larren)\n\nGrayscale Digital Large Cap Fund\n\nWhile speaking at the 2017 World Technology Forum in New York, Larren met Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert, who was talking right after him about the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, through which retail investors could get exposure to Bitcoin through their brokerage. He was also working on a new investment vehicle called Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC), which represented a weighted portfolio of cryptocurrencies, including Ether, MATIC, ADA and SOL, in addition to Bitcoin.\n\nAs a publicly traded investment instrument, it would require approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. One relevant matter would be to ensure that the fund could buy its digital assets from a trusted source, preferably from within the United States. Larren\u2019s mining firm was an ideal source, and having a ready buyer for mining proceeds made business smoother.\n\nThis opportunity represented Larren\u2019s first foray into crypto beyond Bitcoin, and it \u201cattracted me to a new space.\u201d\n\nWorking with the SEC was no easy task, Larren recalls. \u201cIt was a nerve-racking process. Though the company was very confident about getting approval, there was a lot of uncertainty because no such investment trust had been approved previously.\u201d\n\nHowever, the GDLC was approved, expanding the potential pool of crypto investors. Though many in the industry continue to preach the \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d mantra, Larren argues that just as with stocks, owning Bitcoin and other crypto assets through a financial instrument instead of on an exchange or cold-storage device is preferable for most of the public.\n\nThere is less risk of being hacked or losing access to keys, and regulated funds must meet stringent security policies and often carry insurance. He also notes that they are easier to manage on a portfolio basis, particularly regarding taxation and being more straightforward for accountants to understand.\n\nWill BlackRock\u2019s Bitcoin ETF be approved?\n\nThese advantages make it easy to see why heavyweights of the financial industry see an opportunity in offering Bitcoin investment vehicles accessible to retail investors. One of these is BlackRock, which recently applied to launch a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund in the United States.\n\n\u201cBlackRock offers the credibility to convince the SEC that the Bitcoin market can be operated safely and has much to offer investors,\u201d Larren says optimistically. He expects that with BlackRock\u2019s track record of 575 approved ETFs versus one denial, it will soon come online, with similar products expected in other markets.\n\n\u201cI think it would lead to an automatic rise in Bitcoin\u2019s price. I think many people are on the sidelines waiting for clarity, and that\u2019s a step in Bitcoin\u2019s institutional adoption.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a very long time, Grayscale had a premium on its shares\u201d compared with the price of Bitcoin, Larren notes, explaining that the security, certainty and convenience meant that more conservative investors were historically willing to pay more per BTC. BlackRock\u2019s ETF is unlikely to hold a large premium, which would serve to make the market more efficient.\n\nAll roads in Decentraland lead to Beeple\n\nLarren first heard about the metaverse through Decentraland\u2019s initial coin offering in August 2017. \u201cThey were selling 90,000 pieces of NFT land in the metaverse,\u201d he recalls, adding that he felt a proximity to the project\u2019s Argentine founders due to South America\u2019s shared currency issues. \u201cMy first NFT purchase was actually buying my name in the metaverse,\u201d he says, recalling how he spent 100 MANA to name his avatar.\n\n\n\nHe was also given a piece of land on which to build the Airvey art gallery, where Larren placed various NFTs for sale. When Christie\u2019s announced it would auction Beeple\u2019s \u201cEverydays\u201d piece in its first-ever NFT auction in March 2021 \u2014 a story previously covered by Magazine \u2014 the auction house contacted the Airvey gallery to invite bids.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be the first person in the world who bid seven figures on an NFT.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell that escalated quickly\u201d was Beeple\u2019s only comment when Larren\u2019s bid for $1 million came through, representing the first volley in a bidding battle that would see an anonymous buyer later revealed as Vignesh Sundaresan, also known as Metakovan, beat Tron founder Justin Sun with a record-setting bid of $69 million.\n\nBeeple posted his reaction to the $1 million bid on Instagram.\n\nBored Apes design ApeCoin\n\nWith a newfound passion for NFTs, Larren joined Horizen Labs in 2021, months before the firm began discussions with Yuga Labs, a small company where four founders were working on an NFT project involving monkeys.\n\nYuga contracted Horizen Labs to create ApeCoin, a large allocation of which was distributed to holders of Yuga\u2019s NFT collections \u2014 including Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club and Bored Ape Kennel Club \u2014 via massive airdrop.\n\n\u201cWe did everything from the white paper, tokenomics, to listing on exchanges. In less than 20 minutes, it became an $8 billion project,\u201d Larren says, referring to the token\u2019s undiluted market cap, now about $2 billion. In addition to the launch, Larren notes that Horizen Labs designed the token\u2019s staking mechanism, which will see \u201c100 million tokens distributed to the community over three years.\n\nAs Gucci and TAG Heuer began accepting ApeCoin as a form of payment, Larren\u2019s luxury contacts came calling back.\n\n\u201cI spent a week with Chanel\u2019s team at a castle in the English countryside, educating them on all aspects of Web3,\u201d including MetaMask and NFT drops. Larren observes that as he moved from \u201cthe most successful physical goods company, LVMH, to the most successful digital goods company, Yuga Labs, the thought process was the same.\u201d\n\nHe describes metaverse real estate and PFPs, which include Yuga\u2019s famous monkey pictures, as fitting into a broad category of \u201cconsumer NFTs\u201d that are purchased by individuals in a way not dissimilar to luxury goods. Indeed, he notes that many of LVMH founder Bernard Arnault\u2019s children \u2014 heirs of the world\u2019s second-richest man \u2014 are actively dabbling in them.\n\nLarren overlooking the Horizen Labs office floor in Milan. (Elias Ahonen)\n\n\u201cPeople want to feel that they are part of an exclusive community with like-minded individuals,\u201d he explains, relating the concept sold in luxury boutiques and exclusive events the world over. In the case of Yuga\u2019s NFTs, he argues that \u201cthere is value for many people in being members of a group that shares similar cultural references, whether it being digital or at concerts,\u201d referring to events like ApeFest, the next of which will take place in Hong Kong in November.\n\nCan an ape JPG really be a blue-chip NFT?\n\nNFTs that gain mass appeal as recognizable status symbols are often labeled as \u201cblue chip\u201d among the NFT community, a nod to a term typically referring to reliable stocks and originally derived from poker, where blue chips are traditionally the most valuable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a brand-building element as recognition of industry and buyers. Supply is far less than demand, and there is a strong fan and collector base. In traditional art, Picasso and Jean-Michel Basquiat are blue chips,\u201d he explains, noting that Bored Apes and CryptoPunks hold such a position within the PFP hierarchy.\n\n\u201cThe price is a result of the value that has been created. When you go to a Louis Vuitton store, the price is nowhere to be seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cHolding a BAYC can make sense because you can stake it to earn tokens, and it can act as a financial instrument because you can borrow against it,\u201d he notes, naturally enough, considering his company designed the staking mechanism.\n\nLarren poses in Milan with images of NFTs, including a Bored Ape and an Otherside land plot. (Elias Ahonen)\n\n\u201cThere are blue chips in other categories as well, such as metaverse land,\u201d he adds, cautioning that its value, \u201clike traditional real estate, will depend on the income generated with it.\u201d\n\nThis is because, in his opinion, people will not remain interested in vast spaces of empty metaverse land but rather in spaces that are built up and useful, like his art gallery. \u201cTraditional real estate involves buildings \u2014 the same will be true of metaverse land.\u201d\n\nWhere might we look for the next crop of blue chips?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m now passionate about building on top of Bitcoin with BRC-20s and Ordinals,\u201d Larren explains, hinting that something big is in the works. For him, the coming metaverse is a place and time \u201cwhen your digital life is more important than your physical life and where digital image matters more than physical image.\u201d In this new environment, he believes that the Bitcoin chain, with its newfound capability to host NFTs, will hold a key position as a central pillar.\n\n\u201cIn Web3, you need to anticipate how consumer taste will evolve and what the market will want in the next six months.\u201d"

        "content": "Sazmining, a hosted Bitcoin mining provider committed to 100% renewable energy, has set its sights on South America with the establishment of a new facility in Paraguay. Slated to commence operations on September 15th, the facility takes advantage of Paraguay's low electricity prices, offering hosting at an competitive rate of 4.7 cents per kWh \u2013 a far cry from the average cost of 16.1 cents per kWh in the United States.\n\n\"By harnessing surplus electricity, Bitcoin mining has ingeniously transformed Paraguay's previous losses into a profitable venture for the entire nation,\" stated Kent Halliburton, President and COO of Sazmining. \"Embracing this development, Paraguayan politicians and the local power provider, ANDE, are actively participating in electricity-for-Bitcoin transactions. Beyond immediate financial gains, Sazmining has a larger vision focused on creating a sustainable and forward-looking future by investing in electrical infrastructure that will benefit Paraguay for generations to come, extending well beyond the lifespan of any Bitcoin mining activities.\"\n\nAs a fully non-custodial service, Sazmining ensures customers' Bitcoin rewards are directly sent from the mining pool to their private wallets. Operating on a mutually beneficial model, Sazmining only earns when the customer does, incentivizing them to optimize the mining environment for maximum efficiency and the longevity of the miners.\n\nThe facility will provide customers with their signature white-glove, on-site maintenance, customer-service experiences, and a dedicated security team to ensure the highest standards of safety and performance.\n\nIn 1971, Brazil and Paraguay joined forces to construct the Itaipu Dam, generating 14 gigawatts of electricity. Under the agreement, Brazil financed the project, and in return, Paraguay received surplus electricity beyond its domestic needs. Initially faced with the challenge of handling this surplus, Paraguay started selling the excess power to Brazil, albeit at a financial loss. However, the advent of the Bitcoin mining industry has now presented a perfect solution to this situation, allowing Paraguay to not only profit from their surplus energy but also house advanced Bitcoin mining facilities.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

However, BTC20, an ERC-20 Bitcoin version also known as green Bitcoin, is making quite a huge splash and can easily outshine this controversial project.\n\n<<<Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nWorldcoin Price Prediction\n\nBefore diving deeper into the details of this project, let\u2019s first take a look at the price prediction table.\n\nYear Price (Min-Max) 2023 $3.5 \u2013 $4.8 2024 $3.8 \u2013 $5.2 2025 $4 \u2013 $6.5 2030 $7.4 \u2013 $9\n\nWorldcoin is a project founded in 2019 by Sam Altman, Max Novendstern, and Alex Blania. The project aims to create a \u201cdigital passport\u201d utilizing \u201cProof of personhood.\u201d In order to obtain a Worldcoin ID, users are required to undergo an in-person iris scan using the project\u2019s AI-powered scanners called orbs.\n\nAccording to data from Crunchbase, Worldcoin successfully raised $125 million through two funding rounds. The Series A round was initiated on October 21st, 2021, and it was led by Andreessen Horowitz, resulting in funding of $25 million. Following the Series A round, Worldcoin initiated an ICO, which raised $100 million through investments from Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures.\n\n<<<Buy The Best Coin Now<<<\n\nAs of the time of writing, the project is still in its infancy, having been launched on July 24th. After the launch, the price of Worldcoin significantly increased by more than 42%. Since then, the price has experienced some correction, and the current value of WLD stands at $2.38.\n\nAccording to the experts, the maximum price could go up to $9 by the end of 2030, but the question that bothers many people is, would this crypto really conquer the world? Could it overtake Bitcoin? Well, it is highly unlikely due to people\u2019s fear surrounding Al technology. Since Bitcoin hovers around $29k and is too expensive for most investors, most people turn to BTC20. Here is why!\n\n<<< Get BTC20 Now<<<\n\nBTC20 Poised to Leave Worldcoin Behind\n\nBitcoin has made a huge difference to the world as we know it. The recent launch of BTC20 has made it clear that BTC history can be recreated, and it was done with the goal of giving investors one more shot at getting it at the modest price of $1. This pricing pays tribute to Bitcoin\u2019s early days in 2011, infusing the project with a nostalgic touch.\n\nBTC20\u2019s straightforward plan has already proven to be a game-changer, yielding significant results during the ongoing presale aimed at funding marketing efforts and expanding the project\u2019s scope. But BTC20 goes beyond mere symbolism; it introduces an innovative passive income-staking feature akin to a modern version of Bitcoin\u2019s block reward mechanism. What sets it apart is its eco-friendly nature and accessibility for all.\n\n<<< Get BTC20 Now<<<\n\nCompared to WLD, it is easy to understand why people prefer investing in BTC20. The launch of Worldcoin\u2019s eye-scanning site in London on Monday raised eyebrows as people lined up to participate in the questionable \u201corbing\u201d process. This procedure involves scanning individuals\u2019 irises to verify their humanity and eligibility for a \u201cWorld ID\u201d on the Worldcoin smartphone app. As a reward for undergoing this concerning procedure, participants are handed roughly \u00a340 worth of the project\u2019s cryptocurrency, WLD.\n\nIt is concerning to note that this \u201corbing\u201d process is being rolled out in 35 cities across 20 countries, indicating a widespread invasion of privacy in the name of digital identification. However, it is notable that the rollout conveniently skips the United States, where regulatory concerns seem to be holding up the currency\u2019s introduction. One cannot help but wonder whether the absence of regulatory approval in the US is due to the potential ethical and legal implications of such a biometric identification system. At the same time, the presale of BTC20 is progressing extremely fast.\n\n<<< Get BTC20 Now<<<\n\nBTC20 Presale going strong \u2013 More than $2 million raised\n\nDuring the presale, 6.05 million BTC20 tokens will be available, just like the original token supply for BTC back in 2011. Any unsold presale tokens will be incorporated into the BTC20 staking contract before the official listing, ultimately capping the total supply at 21 million BTC20 tokens. This offers investment opportunities and enables active token holders to stake their assets and earn a portion of the staking rewards. The brilliance of this staking mechanism lies in its community-driven approach. As more people participate in staking, the collective rewards grow, leading to prosperity for everyone involved.\n\n<<< Get BTC20 Now<<<\n\nBy embracing staking with BTC20, the investors will not only tap into the inherent value of the tokens but also reap the rewards distributed through the staking contract. Following the original Bitcoin token release schedule, these rewards are released with each block confirmation, ensuring steady and sustainable growth in the long run. With a well-thought-out design intended to offer reliable returns for around 120 years, it\u2019s no wonder that BTC20 is being hailed as an absolute gem with the potential to yield remarkable returns for investors.\n\nIf you\u2019re seeking a project that combines a rich history, innovative features, and a community-focused growth strategy, BTC20 is undoubtedly an enticing opportunity worth exploring. Don\u2019t miss your chance to be part of this thrilling journey, where possibilities for substantial rewards abound!\n\n<<< Get BTC20 Now<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nThe world is facing many changes, and one of the biggest ones is the use of Al. Having a crypto that directly uses it raises many questions, which is why it may hardly achieve the desired results. On the other hand, BTC20 is an environment-friendly token that is a fresh opportunity for big gains, just like BTC brought to early investors in the past, making it easy to see why it is poised to outshine it!\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

First, you can find different types of bitcoins in India, and we\u2019ll discuss them in subsequent paragraphs.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency, like the Indian rupee, US dollar, or British pound, but it exists only in digital form. It is decentralised, meaning that no one person or organisation controls it. Any government or bank does not run it and can be used to buy goods and services online or to store value like an investment.\n\n\n\nHow to Buy Bitcoin in India\n\nBuying Bitcoin in India can be done in various ways. The most popular way is to buy Bitcoin through an exchange. An exchange is a platform that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. To purchase Bitcoin, users need to create an account on the exchange and then follow the steps to complete the transaction.\n\n\n\nThe second way to buy Bitcoin in India is through peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms, which are online marketplaces where individuals can buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly with each other. The process requires users to create an account and search for sellers offering Bitcoin. Once a suitable seller is found, the buyer can initiate the transaction and complete the purchase.\n\n\n\nA third way to purchase Bitcoin in India is through ATMs. There are several Bitcoin ATMs located in various cities in India. The process is relatively simple. All that is required is for the user to insert cash into the machine and then follow the instructions to complete the transaction.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Top 10 Cryptocurrencies to Invest in India\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Buying Bitcoin in India\n\nThe most popular form of digital currency today is Bitcoin.

There are various ways to get bitcoins in India, such as using a broker, buying from a Bitcoin ATM, and exchanging it with another person. It also allows users to make payments anonymously without revealing their identity.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are some drawbacks to buying Bitcoin in India:\n\nThe current number of bitcoins in India is limited, which means the price of bitcoins can be volatile. The government still needs to make regulations or laws regarding the use of cryptocurrencies, making it challenging to regulate the market. There is the risk of scams and fraud, as the government does not regulate them.\n\n\n\nHow to Store Bitcoin in India\n\nIndia is rapidly becoming one of the leading countries regarding Bitcoin adoption. If you are in India and are looking to store your bitcoin, there are several ways to get it done. One of the simplest ways to get Bitcoin in India is to purchase it from an exchange.\n\n\n\nSeveral reputable exchanges in India allow users to buy, sell and store Bitcoin. You can also use an online wallet to store your Bitcoin. There are several online wallets available that allow users to store their Bitcoin securely.\n\n\n\nFinally, if you want to store your Bitcoin offline, you can opt for a hardware wallet. A hardware wallet is a device that allows users to store their Bitcoin securely offline.\n\n\n\nTypes of Bitcoins in India\n\nAs of 2023, there are several types of Bitcoins in India, each with its unique characteristics and uses.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the first and most well-known type of cryptocurrency used for storing value and exchanging.\n\nOther types of Bitcoins exist in addition to BTC, including Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), and Bitcoin SV (BSV).\n\nEach type of Bitcoin has its own differences and applications.\n\nThe exact number of Bitcoins in circulation in India is difficult to determine, but it is estimated to be around 1 million.\n\nThe number of Bitcoins in circulation in India is subject to change as the popularity and usage of Bitcoin continues to grow.\n\nDifferent types of Bitcoins in India offer unique opportunities and risks for investors and users.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the differences between each type of Bitcoin and carefully considering their potential benefits and drawbacks before investing or using them is crucial.\n\n\n\nIndian Exchanges for Buying Bitcoin\n\nMultiple Indian exchanges offer to buy and sell Bitcoin. Although the Indian government has not yet regulated cryptocurrencies, buying and selling Bitcoin in India is still possible. However, the Indian exchanges are not as advanced as the global exchanges.\n\n\n\nThe most popular Indian exchanges for buying Bitcoin are WazirX, Unocoin, CoinDCX, and Zebpay. These exchanges provide a secure platform for buying and selling Bitcoin. They also offer other features, such as portfolio management and trading services.\n\n\n\nThe price of Bitcoin in India is also slightly higher than the global average. A single Bitcoin in India can range from around $7000 to $8000. Thus, if you are looking to buy Bitcoin in India, these are some of the best Indian exchanges to consider. They provide a secure and reliable platform for buying and selling Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin is a decentralised digital currency and it is the most popular cryptocurrency in the world. It has come to be recognised as a great investment option for those looking to diversify their portfolio and increase their returns.\n\nHowever, it is important to research and understand the risks of buying Bitcoin in India. With the emergence of new exchanges, buying Bitcoin in India has become much easier and safer. With the right knowledge and strategy, investors can make huge profits from buying Bitcoin in India.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe investment options and stocks mentioned here are not recommendations.

        "title": "Crypto news: Bulgaria holds more Bitcoin than the United States - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "Breaking News: Bulgaria turns out to hold a Bitcoin balance of more than 200,000, even surpassing the share held by the United States.\n\nThe Bulgarian government is playing its trump card to become one of the most economically established countries in the world, hoping that its $6 billion countervalue in cryptocurrency can multiply in the future.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the details of the news together.\n\nCrypto news: Bulgaria\u2019s balance of more than 200,000 Bitcoin\n\nThe latest crypto news talks about Bulgaria and the incredible discovery of a balance of more than 200,000 Bitcoin, with a countervalue of about $6.3 billion\n\nThe huge sum was acquired by the Balkan country through a cyber seizure that took place in May 2017.\n\nSpecifically,from an investigation called \u201cPRATKA/VIRUS,\u201d Bulgarian authorities were able to stop a criminal group organized in the infiltration of viruses into the country\u2019s customs computer systems.\n\nFrom the 28 arrests made there, a large amount of cash, computers, communications devices, tablets, and various equipment were confiscated, as well as a staggering 213,519 BTC, or about 1% of the currency\u2019s circulating supply\n\nThe criminal gang used cryptocurrency because of its anonymity component and the simplicity with which they could transfer value from one area of the continent to another, without incurring transportation risks.\n\nThe sum at the time was worth \u201conly\u201d $500 million but has now reached a significantly higher countervalue.\n\nIt is still unclear how Bulgarian law enforcement managed to seize the massive BTC stack, but some rumors in recent days claim that all the loot is still jealousy held by the country.\n\nIf that were the case, Bulgaria would rank hands down first as the state with the most Bitcoin in its possession, topping the US, which enjoys assets of 194,188 units of digital gold.\n\nIn this case too, the amount held by the US is the result of raids on cybercrimes: these include the cases of hacker James Zhong, the cyber heist of Bitfinex and the seizure of the Silk Road darknet marketplace.\n\nThe US government would have actually still been the world\u2019s leading entity in terms of Bitcoin holdings, were it not for the fact that in March 2023 it sold a part of it on Coinbase and through special institutional auctions.\n\nBulgaria\u2019s cryptographic future\n\nAfter the latest crypto news related to the discovery of Bulgaria\u2019s Bitcoin balances, we can go out on a limb and say that the Eastern European country may enjoy a rosy future in the coming years.\n\nIf the predictions of experts on the future price of Bitcoin turn out to be right, such as that of the consulting firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, which predicts a price of $200,000 by 2028, then Bulgaria may indeed have hit the jackpot.\n\nAt those figures, the country\u2019s cryptocurrency countervalue would amount to $42.6 billion, about half of Bulgaria\u2019s GDP according to 2021 figures, or three times the national debt according to 2019 figures.\n\nAt the moment, at current prices, the government would not be able to pay off even half of the liabilities it has on account.\n\nHence, the idea of Bulgarian heads of state preferring to hold the cryptocurrency in order to hopefully generate a condition of widespread wealth for the whole country rather than cover some patches today remains quite agreeable.\n\nThat said, the government should still look for less risky solutions in order to improve its economic fate, such as supporting the development of crypto- and blockchain-themed businesses, as is the case in Germany, Britain, Switzerland, and Portugal.\n\nThe future price of Bitcoin is very uncertain, and it may take longer than usual for the cryptocurrency to reach $200,000, hence it is always good to have an alternative plan that can exploit the potential of new technologies.\n\nThe Bitcoin standard and new decentralized infrastructures are spreading at a faster rate around the world than Bulgaria, with news reports of increasingly disruptive adoption, especially in less developed countries.\n\nHence, even with a fortune behind it, the Balkan country may be paying the price for lacking long-term foresight and taking a passive approach to technology development, losing out on several tens of billions of dollars in future profits."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price has experienced a short-term recovery, making attempts to secure substantial gains above the $29,000 level while the asset maintains a sideways trading pattern. As the market anticipates a potential price rebound beyond the $30,000 mark, historical data suggests that Bitcoin might encounter a bumpy ride in the upcoming months.\n\nIn particular, an analysis by prominent pseudonymous crypto market analyst Fiery Trading shared in a TradingView post on July 26 indicates that Bitcoin could be in for challenging months during the third quarter. The analysis suggests the asset has been facing bearish performance during its pre-halving phase.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the cryptocurrency has historically experienced a downturn during this time frame, with all three pre-halving years showing a significant price drop, surpassing 20% at some point.\n\nThe analysis indicates that a potential 20% drop from the current monthly open could result in Bitcoin\u2019s price declining to $25,000.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Trading View\n\n\u201cAs seen on the chart, Bitcoin\u2019s performance has ALWAYS been bad in the third quarter. During all three pre-halving years, the price dropped over 20% at some point. As of today, BTC is down a little over 4%. A 20% drop from the monthly open would bring Bitcoin back at $25,000,\u201d he said.\n\nBitcoin makes minor recovery\n\nAmid the analysis, Bitcoin made minimal gains, seemingly unfazed by the recent Federal Reserve decision to raise interest rates by 25 basis points. However, it still lags significantly behind its peak in July at $31,800.\n\nInterestingly, the cryptocurrency appears to remain relatively unaffected by macroeconomic events despite witnessing more significant price fluctuations over the past year due to such events.\n\nAs interest in Bitcoin\u2019s future performance persists, Finbold utilized Google Bard, a generative artificial intelligence (AI) platform, to predict the asset\u2019s valuation. The tool highlighted factors that could potentially influence Bitcoin\u2019s price following the 2024 halving event, known as a bullish factor.\n\nIn addition to the AI prediction, financial experts shared their projections for Bitcoin\u2019s price by the end of 2023. According to Finbold\u2019s report, these experts believe that Bitcoin might reclaim trading levels near the $40,000 mark.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was trading at $29,429 after making minor gains of over 1% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin is down around 1.5%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart.

        "content": "Although Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading sideways for the larger part of the previous week, zooming out on its chart demonstrates that the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset has been moving in a familiar pre-halving pattern, giving a general idea of when to expect the next all-time high (ATH).\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin is currently imitating the chart patterns from its previous pre-halving periods that preceded a massive bullish price rally for the maiden cryptocurrency, as observed by the pseudonymous crypto market analyst Stockmoney Lizards in a tweet shared on July 25.\n\nBitcoin pre-halving behavior analysis. Source: Stockmoney Lizards\n\nSpecifically, Bitcoin\u2019s behavior in 2023, including the recent price action, is reminiscent of the largest crypto asset\u2019s activities preceding the halving in 2016 and 2020, and the current trend suggests it will begin its stronger upward movement by the end of the pre-halving period, i.e., with the halving around May 2024.\n\nEarlier, the crypto trading expert pointed out that this could lead to a new record for Bitcoin, culminating with an ATH in 2025, somewhere in the areas of $110,000 and beyond, with its current price level acting as a base for this jump, as per the chart pattern analysis published in a tweet on July 25.\n\nBitcoin pre-halving and ATH chart. Source: Stockmoney Lizards\n\nInterestingly, the analyst\u2019s projections are in line with those shared by Google\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) tool, Bard, particularly those by the stock-to-flow (S2F) model by crypto expert PlanB and British multinational bank Standard Chartered, which have set the price of Bitcoin at $100,000 and $120,000 in 2024, respectively.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time changing hands at the price of $29,215, indicating a gain of 0.21% on the day, a 2.73% decline in the last week, and a drop of 3.90% over the previous month, according to the latest information retrieved on July 26.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart.

        "title": "Ethereum or Bitcoin: What is a Better Investment Option? - PC Tech Magazine",
        "content": "When it comes to cryptocurrencies and the cryptocurrency market, any person interested in them will, first of all, mention Bitcoin and Ethereum. The major cryptocurrencies have really changed the world, but which one is better for investment? Should I convert USDC to ETH now or is it better to buy BTC?\n\nWhat is the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nBitcoin was the first successful cryptocurrency and was created as an alternative means of payment, a decentralized digital currency. Although during its existence it has not yet become an alternative form of money, it is still evolving towards a means of payment and a means of storing value. Experts say that Bitcoin is acquiring more and more features that bring it closer to gold.\n\nEthereum is a multifunctional blockchain platform and cryptocurrency. Initially, the goal of creating Ethereum was to develop an improved version of Bitcoin, but today there are more differences between the main cryptocurrencies than similarities. Ethereum is multi-tasking and, above all, it remains a development tool. The massive emergence of new crypto projects and entire areas of the crypto industry is primarily the merit of Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin is more independent and decentralized and has more confidence from investors. There are fewer hard forks in its history, while Ethereum already boasts a whole bunch of individual options that are available for purchase, including on https://letsexchange.io/exchange/eth-to-btc on par with the original coin.\n\nOn the other hand, ETH has more applications. The platform\u2019s capabilities can potentially be used in logistics, finance, and audit. Another undoubted advantage of Ethereum is the high speed of transaction processing. To eliminate problems with the scalability of the blockchain, a transition was made to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. It is expected that after the phased introduction of additional updates, the throughput of the platform will increase by orders of magnitude.\n\nIn terms of the combination of characteristics and capabilities, Ethereum surpasses Bitcoin in terms of the increase in the volume of transactions and the number of active users. At the same time, Ether is more volatile than Bitcoin.\n\nAnother significant difference concerns monetary policy. The emission of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million units, and this creates the preconditions for an increase in the price of the asset. The supply of ETH coins is unlimited, although anti-inflationary measures are provided in the tokenomics.\n\nThe price of BTC is formed directly by the market, while the price of ETH is highly dependent on the platform itself and the pace of development of the DeFi industry. At the moment, the Ethereum blockchain is the leader in its segment, but the emergence of a worthy competitor is a matter of time.\n\nWhich coin to choose for long-term investment\n\nThe long-term prospects for Ethereum and Bitcoin depend on many variables. First of all, it is the functionality of each asset, the ratio of supply and demand, as well as pressure from regulators.\n\nEthereum firmly holds the second position in the ranking of the most capitalized cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is also consistently the flagship of the market and sets its overall dynamics. There are no prerequisites for moving ETH in the rating one line lower or higher yet.\n\nToday, we can confidently say that both assets are suitable for long-term investment. Bitcoin is more stable, less volatile, it has a more stable reputation. The adoption of Bitcoin as a means of payment increases its credibility of it, and institutional investors are investing in the coin.\n\nHowever, Ethereum is now cheaper and could potentially be more profitable. Therefore, it makes sense not only to follow the Ethereum rate but also to include it in an investment portfolio to diversify risks.\n\nALSO READ: INVESTING IN CRYPTOCURRENCY, TOO LATE TO THE PARTY?"
