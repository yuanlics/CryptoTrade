        "title": "Bitcoin and Geopolitical Rivalry - Geopoliticalmonitor.com",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the flagship stateless cryptocurrency, is a double-edged sword that can either strengthen or harm national power. As financial warfare becomes increasingly complex, this decentralized cybercurrency is acting as a versatile strategic instrument of statecraft that can play various roles under confrontational geopolitical circumstances. This under-researched subject matter needs to be clarified because it entails meaningful implications for national security, strategic intelligence, foreign policy and grand strategy, but also for the domain of high finance. In order to provide a sharper sense of situational awareness, the following article integrates strategic forecasts that attempt to predict the hypothetical usefulness of Bitcoin for conflicts with scrutiny of illustrative contemporary examples that point in a similar direction.\n\nAnalysis of Hypothetical Applications\n\nBTC circuits as conduits to bypass sanctions\n\nBitcoin can offer a potential lifeline for states under sanctions that need to ensure the continuity of their international economic exchanges. Since the BTC grid cannot be controlled by the coercive or restrictive power of national states, its borderless circuitry provides secondary financial arteries worth harnessing to bypass sanctions that limit the ability to carry out cross-border transactions and transfer wealth through more conventional platforms \u2012 anchored to major reserve currencies \u2012 that enable international payments. An additional advantage of decentralized virtual currencies for sanctioned states is their discretion. They offer covert gateways to engage formal financial systems or even to avoid them altogether if necessary. In other words, it is difficult to determine if sanctions are being neutralized through cryptocurrencies like BTC.\n\nFurthermore, despite their drawbacks \u2012 including wildly volatile exchange rates \u2012 nonstate cryptocurrencies like BTC are helpful to evade sanctions thanks to their growing transnational projection, their unsupervised channels, and their lack of centralized nerve centers that could be politically threatened, co-opted, or influenced. An academic essay written by US military officer Deane Konowicz for the US Naval War College identifies three strategies to use unofficial virtual currencies as asymmetric equalizers to diminish or overcome sanctions imposed by an enemy with superior financial firepower. Yet, the implementation of each comes with challenging caveats.\n\nThe theft of wealth through acts of cybercrime against cryptocurrency exchanges or ransomware attacks to demand payments denominated in cryptocurrency. This approach requires sophisticated cyberwarfare know-how.\n\nCryptocurrency mining on a large scale as an industrial activity which generates profits that do not flow through traditional financial networks. This pursuit demands investment, technological infrastructure, advanced hardware, vast amounts of energy, and technical expertise.\n\nThe encouragement of the sanctioned state\u2019s population and business community to freely carry out all sorts of transactions through cryptocurrencies. Said possibility comes with the risks of weakening the position of the country\u2019s official currency and the prospect of widespread economic instability, a phenomenon that could lead in turn to political turmoil.\n\nSome statesmen have also identified the potential usefulness of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to diminish the impact of sanctions through arteries that bypass the US dollar. For example, according to a report published by the Russian newspaper Kommersant, Sergei Glazyev \u2012 one of the Kremlin\u2019s chief geoeconomic masterminds \u2012 argues that the Russian Federation has an \u201cobjective need\u201d to rely on unofficial cryptocurrencies to circumvent Western sanctions. Nevertheless, BTC is no \u201csilver bullet\u201d that can completely defuse enemy sanctions. Its limitations are also being acknowledged. In a 2021 interview with CNBC, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted that Bitcoin is a valid means of payment, but he also mentioned that, even though Russia has been seeking alternatives to the dollar in international economic exchanges as a result of its weaponization by Washington, it was still too soon to anchor the exports of Russian energy and commodities to such cryptocurrency.\n\nYet, as a result of the Western backlash against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Moscow is seemingly reassessing its position and deliberating about the eventual pertinence of embracing BTC in several sectors to carry out international transactions that deflect American and European sanctions. In this context, Moscow is reportedly considering the possibility of accepting Bitcoin as payment for its energy exports. Since crypto-assets cannot be frozen or seized, they represent potentially attractive financial vehicles for states that seek to contest the interests of Western powers. According to the New York Times, in order to gather stockpiles of unofficial cryptocurrencies to carry out undetected international transactions, the Russians could even engage in ransomware cyberattacks and develop technical tools designed to mask the involvement of Russian entities in said transactions throughout blockchain-based financial environments.\n\nThese possibilities indicate that Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies can hypothetically operate as protective shields for states under sanctions. As such, they pose game-changing challenges for the effective implementation of sanctions as a tool of diplomatic coercion by the US and its allies, especially considering that such measures have become an increasingly common staple of Western foreign policy. Nevertheless, some analysts believe that measures like better regulations, collaborative information-sharing partnerships between governmental agencies and private entities, international cooperation, and increased oversight can prevent the evasion of sanctions through Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies.\n\nBTC as a potential asset to hedge the financial risk of geopolitical tensions\n\nBitcoin has been identified as an unconventional asset that could be helpful to hedge financial risks in case of conflicts or heightened geopolitical tensions. Some scholars hold that BTC can operate as some sort of \u201cdigital gold\u201d because it represents a potential safe haven that provides shelter from exposure to rising systemic geopolitical tensions. In fact, the value of Bitcoin seems to be positively influenced by the incidence of phenomena which trigger a perception of geopolitical turmoil, such as Brexit, the rivalry between Iran and the US in the Middle East, and the so-called \u201ctrade war\u201d between Washington and Beijing. These attributes make BTC attractive for national states, private companies and individuals.\n\nAn important advantage of Bitcoin as an alternative asset is its high resilience from both volatile market fluctuations and potentially hostile manipulations not motivated by economic interests. Plus, the horizontal Bitcoin system cannot be destroyed. As the American financier James Rickards explains, even though some of its material or digital nodes can be attacked, the dispersed structure of BTC organic networks contains no center of gravity. BTC also lacks centralized systemic records kept in physical servers which could be hit. The ability of the Bitcoin environment to withstand the impact of disruptions from external sources was demonstrated when China followed a heavy-handed approach towards said cybercurrency. Even though the \u2018Middle Kingdom\u2019 managed to evict Bitcoin from Chinese soil, the whole BTC ecosystem was not undermined, and China-based mining operations simply relocated to other countries with more flexible frameworks.\n\nHowever, a nuanced perspective shows that, despite its advantages, Bitcoin is far from being a suitable replacement for hard assets with intrinsic worth like precious metals. As Refk Selmi and other researchers point out, there are major differences that need to be highlighted: 1) Bitcoin\u2019s markets are smaller and less structured; 2) its supply is artificially limited by design; 3) the volatility of this cryptocurrency makes it convenient for short-term speculative purposes rather than as a long-term store of value; 4) whereas BTC is a nascent monetary item, the traditional role of gold as stable store of value is supported by the weight of history since the dawn of civilization; 5) Bitcoin\u2019s legal status is unclear in many jurisdictions.\n\nPotential weaponization of BTC\n\nBitcoin can also hypothetically act as a weaponized instrument that can be wielded in the practice of statecraft. Ironically, its anti-state properties mean that it can be employed by states against their rivals in offensive acts of hybrid warfare. As an article in the Small Wars Journal argues, The BTC landscape offers 1) asymmetric advantages to instigate monetary disruption in small nations with weak currencies, 2) covert channels to fund terrorist, insurgent, separatist, guerrilla or dissident groups whose militant activities fuel destabilization behind enemy lines and 3) subtle gateways to increase the resonance of psychological warfare, \u201csoft power,\u201d and propagandistic influence through the undisclosed purchase of an active presence in the overlapping platforms that undergird the transnational info-sphere. Potentially, BTC can even be engaged to hit heavier targets. Interestingly, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Peter Thiel, himself a strong supporter of BTC, has expressed his concerns about the potential weaponization of Bitcoin by Beijing against the US: \u201cI do wonder whether at this point [if] Bitcoin should also be thought [of] in part of as a Chinese financial weapon against the US where it threatens fiat money, but it especially threatens the US dollar.\u201d Paradoxically, the fact that China despises Bitcoin at home does not mean that it cannot be useful abroad as a spearhead against major strategic competitors.\n\nAnalysis of Empirical Realities\n\nInvolvement of BTC in predatory acts of cyber-financial warfare committed by North Korea\n\nBTC offers opportunities to engage in unconventional forms of economic predation. According to a report prepared by a panel of experts for the UN Security Council (2019), the North Korean military intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, has been responsible for acts of cyber financial warfare and cybercrime \u2012including malware and ransomware attacks against foreign corporate targets in South Korea and elsewhere \u2012 involving Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies. Said source claims that Pyongyang\u2019s presence in the cryptocurrency ecosystem also includes mining. It is estimated that the profits made by North Korea through these measures were worth $2 billion over a couple of years. The official report indicates that the resulting stolen wealth can then be used to undertake unsupervised international transactions, evade sanctions, and fund North Korean military expenditures, including its nuclear weapons programme. The American blockchain research firm Chainanalysis calculates that, in 2022 alone, North Korean entities stole $1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrencies through hacking. This aggressive behavior shows the problematic overtones of state-sponsored criminal activities related to crypto assets.\n\nBitcoin is more than a weapon for North Korean statecraft. It also helps Pyongyang compensate its lack of access to mainstream international financial channels and provides money to purchase food. According to a work of investigative journalism, North Korean policymakers regard cryptocurrency as a vital gateway to enhance the country\u2019s financial infrastructure and, despite Bitcoin\u2019s libertarian theoretical underpinnings, its adoption by this communist state is compatible with the strong emphasis of Juche ideology on the pursuit of self-sufficiency. Yet, tricky measures are needed to maximize its usefulness. As a report published by the National Committee on North Korea explains, the volatility of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies makes them unsuitable as permanent vehicles for international payments. Some North Korean partners might accept Bitcoin, but it would make more sense to exchange cryptocurrency for conventional hard cash \u2012 whose liquidity is much higher \u2012 first and then use it to pay for goods and services later.\n\nBTC donations to bankroll the military defense of Ukraine\n\nBitcoin can be used to bolster the military defense of a state in conventional conflicts. In the Ukraine War, it has been used by Kiev to prepare for the clash and to mitigate its consequences. Thanks to crowdfunding campaigns organized by both the Ukrainian government and private networks of volunteers through virtual platforms, Ukraine received donations denominated in cryptocurrency from foreign supporters. This digital war chest was helpful to increase Kiev\u2019s pool of resources before and during the 2022 Russian invasion. According to open sources, said funds were invested in the purchase of military equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles, medical supplies, and even facial recognition software to identify Russian soldiers, spies, and mercenaries.\n\nAlthough Kiev has received far larger sums of money through more traditional financial systems, the BTC grid turned out to be convenient channel for the direct reception of donations from overseas because it does not require the permission of institutional facilitators or intermediaries. Hence, this flow of money completely bypasses the formal paperwork and \u2012 perhaps more importantly \u2012 the restrictions of conventional financial channels that prevent remittances whose purpose is to fund military activities. Ironically, the specialized consulting firm Elliptic Intel notes that this course of action was inspired by the preceding crypto-asset fundraising undertaken for years by pro-Russian separatist militias in the Donbass.\n\nThis reality indicates that cryptocurrency has become not only a mainstream financial phenomenon, but also an instrumental digital asset in contemporary conventional warfighting. Considering that both Moscow and Kiev are actively resorting to decentralized cybercurrencies to gain an upper hand in this ongoing conflict, an article published by the Washington Post metaphorically described such confrontation as the world\u2019s first \u201ccrypto war.\u201d Yet, it is still unknown if cryptocurrencies will represent a game-changer that can decisively alter the facts on the ground in favor of either side.\n\nIn order to increase its war chest of crypto-assets, the Ukrainian government even courted the participation of large private cryptocurrency trading platforms, including FTX, Kuna, and Everstake. This involvement generated unexpected externalities. Specifically, the revelations that have uncovered the fraudulent criminal behavior of private cryptocurrency exchange FTX under the leadership of Sam Bankman-Fried \u2012 involving cyclical transfers of wealth as a scheme that was facilitated by powerful political and corporate connections \u2012 demonstrates that that these initiatives can also offer opportunities that encourage acts of corruption. The resulting fallout is problematic because it harms the public legitimacy of the crowdfunding efforts due to the fear of misappropriation of funds and also because at least some of the money sent by donors might not have reached its intended destination.\n\nIn the context of the Ukraine War, BTC has not just been used to optimize the defensive capabilities of Kiev\u2019s military forces in the operational theatres of engagement. The cryptocurrency has also helped civilians caught in the crossfire. As a response to the destruction of infrastructure, Ukraine\u2019s worsening macroeconomic trouble, the intermittent occupation of large urban areas by Russian forces, the exodus of millions of refugees, and the unreliability or unavailability of traditional financial services under such chaotic conditions, Ukrainian citizens are turning to BTC as a non-traditional monetary item to carry out safe and quick transactions whose purpose is to cover essential needs.\n\nIranian engagement in the BTC ecosystem to deflect the impact of sanctions\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has harnessed the Bitcoin landscape in an effort to deflect Western sanctions through unorthodox measures. According to the consulting firm Elliptic \u2012 involved in the scrutiny of blockchain analytics \u2012 Teheran is encouraging BTC mining in order to use the resulting profits to pay for imports, overcoming the coercive restrictions that limit its ability to participate in economic exchanges carried out through ordinary platforms. Since the process involves the \u2018alchemical\u2019 transformation of energy into cryptocurrency \u2012 a borderless monetary asset that circulates in an almost unrestricted way \u2012 on an industrial scale, it offers the Iranian state an opportunity to monetize its energy resources (oil and natural gas), an important advantage for an economy deprived of hard cash and access to conventional financial services in international capital markets. Furthermore, Teheran is engaged in negotiations with other states \u2012 including Austria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, England, France, Germany, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland \u2012 over the development of collaborative frameworks for the use of cryptocurrencies in cross-border financial transactions. Therefore, for Iran, Bitcoin represents a backdoor to access the world economy. As such, it bolsters its counter-hegemonic policy of \u201ceconomic resistance.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Iran\u2019s position towards stateless cryptocurrencies has zigzagged as the balance between costs and benefits has changed. Iranian authorities reversed their permissiveness towards Bitcoin mining due to rising electricity consumption, shortages of natural gas supplies as a result of the sanctions, Bitcoin\u2019s falling value, and the incidence of droughts which have diminished the operational capacity to generate hydropower. Tehran even launched a clampdown due to concerns over the prospect that widespread BTC mining could overload the country\u2019s power grid and provoke blackouts, a problem which could unleash socio-political unrest. Yet, there are signs which indicate that Tehran is revisiting its position once more. In August 2022, the Iranian Ministry of Industry, Mining, and Trade announced on social media that the Middle Eastern country had completed its first import order denominated in an unnamed stateless cryptocurrency, a transaction worth $10 million, adding that more operations like this will continue in Iran\u2019s international economic exchanges. Although still worried about the problematic consequences of mining for energy security, Iran has released hardware for BTC mining that had been previously seized.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nBoth strategic forecast and analytical assessments reveal that, in the strategic chessboards of 21st century \u201cconnectivity wars,\u201d the leading cryptocurrency can be wielded as a high-tech financial sword or shield by innovative practitioners of economic statecraft. Some predictions have already come true. Others anticipate conceivable possibilities that might come to fruition in the near future. In turn, reality itself has brought some unexpected, but not surprising, developments that had not been foreseen. The unchartered waters of the cryptocurrency ecosystem might bring even more exotic applications of Bitcoin and similar virtual currencies for economic warfare worth exploring that have not been identified yet.\n\nThe increasing weaponization of Bitcoin in conventional and unconventional battlefields is consistent with the transformational character of \u201chybrid warfare.\u201d A century ago, the historiographical German thinker Oswald Spengler explained that rather than an item that flows from one hand to another in economic exchanges, money is \u2012 for modern Faustian civilizations that favor the march of technological development, the pursuit of worldly power and economic dynamism in the quest for wealth \u2012 also an organic impersonal lifeform whose strength can be harnessed to project political force. The ongoing and eventual involvement of Bitcoin in several expressions of conflict shows that such an axiom is certainly valid in the digital age of FinTech."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency is going to the moon.\n\nPartnering with the planetary mobility firm Lunar Outpost, the California-based social intelligence company LunarCrush plans to deliver a treasure chest of 62 Bitcoins currently worth about $1.5 million to the surface of the moon.\n\n\"The Bitcoin bounty, dubbed Nakamoto_1, will be unlocked by the first space traveler to reach the moon and obtain the wallet's private key, which will be etched onto a Lunar Outpost MAPP rover launching into space later this year,\" a press release about the project states.\n\nRelated: How blockchain can change the space industry\n\nAnimation studio Golden Wolf, along with Bitcoin developer tools company Hiro, has collaborated with LunarCrush to conduct this extreme treasure hunt. These partners will sell an exclusive NFT collection to generate the money needed for the Bitcoin bounty, which is intended to inspire the next generation of interplanetary exploration. The sale began March 28 at lunarcrush.com/nakamoto1.\n\n\"When you put out a seemingly unachievable goal, the innovation that happens can be incredible. Our goal is to inspire people to build communities that will unlock a new era of exploration,\" LunarCrush CEO Joe Vezzani said in the press release.\n\n\"We envision classrooms, groups, companies and even DAOs [decentralized autonomous organizations] coming together to reach the moon and split the treasure chest's rewards,\" Vezzani added. \"It's like Willy Wonka's 'golden ticket' for the Web3 era, and we couldn't be more excited to see how it all unfolds.\"\n\nLunar Outpost's MAPP is scheduled to launch late this year atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The rover will touch down near the moon's south pole aboard Intuitive Machines' Nova-C lander.\n\nAfter MAPP hits the gray dirt, any ambitious citizen on Earth can devise a mission to reach it and unlock the golden reward.\n\n\"What may sound outlandish to some will open new frontiers that haven't been explored outside the mind in a long time. Future generations will look to us as pioneers of interplanetary exploration and adventure,\" Forrest Meyen, co-founder and chief strategy officer at Lunar Outpost, said in the press release.\n\n\"LunarCrush is using modern blockchain technology to deliver a treasure instead of organizing a prize committee. This structure incentivizes exploration while unlocking the best of human ingenuity,\" Meyen added. \"Lunar Outpost is proud to provide our first-in-history commercial lunar surface transportation to innovative projects like Nakamoto_1.\"\n\nPer the press release, 25% of each NFT sale ($250 each) will be applied toward funding the moon-bound treasure chest, and another 25% of the proceeds will help fund a general \"community marketing wallet\" to aid future Bitcoin core development and causes related to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education.\n\nGlobal animation and design studio Golden Wolf was contracted to conceive the NFTs and special imagery that range from static images to heavily animated collectibles to set the proper outer space tone.\n\n\"We loved the idea that the art could inspire a new generation of young people to look to the stars, like a contemporary version of an Apollo 11 poster on a bedroom wall,\" Ingi Erlingsson, founder and CEO of Golden Wolf, said in the press release. \"We wanted the aesthetic to feel modern and unique, with a hint of vintage sci-fi art.\"\n\nFollow us @Spacedotcom, or on Facebook and Instagram."

The regulator also proposed rule changes targeted at crypto firms operating as custodians.\n\nMcGlone stated he is still bullish on BTC but expects the price to go down again in step with other assets if a recession hits.\n\nBack in January, he warned BTC might not see the surge being predicted just yet, as there are challenging macroeconomic conditions and pressure from interest-rate hikes.\n\nAccording to McGlone, the April 2 decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to reduce daily oil output makes a recession more likely, as does interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to clamp down on inflation.\n\n\u201cWe had our morning call this morning and our economist Anna Wong said, Yeah, their base case is for that recession to kick in Q3,\" he said.\n\n\u201cOPEC is helping that. Fed tightening is helping that. So all assets have to go down. That means Bitcoin too. It\u2019s the fastest horse in the race. So I\u2019m overall, certainly relatively bullish.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitcoin likely to outperform all crypto assets following banking crisis, analyst explains\n\nIn McGlone\u2019s opinion, it\u2019s \"seriously silly\u201d to risk not having some exposure to crypto or trying to stand in its way.\n\n\u201cThe key thing I look at simplistically for Bitcoin is, if you\u2019re a money manager, why take the risk of not having some of this revolutionary asset, particularly because it\u2019s so controversial you want to have at least some in it because you don\u2019t want to look like an idiot over history,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe smart guys get it; we\u2019re not gonna be a Blockbuster or Sears, and we\u2019re going to be part of this technology.\u201d\n\nMagazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime"

        "content": "The price of a single bitcoin has recently rallied to over $28,000. That\u2019s approaching double its value at the end of last year, which was not a very good year for crypto.\n\nRecall that 2022 saw a string of major bankruptcies in the industry \u2014 most notably, for exchange FTX in November. But bitcoin and other digital currencies are riding a wave of momentum that started last month, around the time of Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s collapse, and the government\u2019s response.\n\nAt The Bagel Exchange in Alhambra, California, one of the first things you see when you walk in is a machine that sells bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nOwner Ryan Natividad says you can pay for your schmear with cash, credit or crypto \u2014 and not just bitcoin and the other big ones.\n\n\u201cWe accept Litecoin and Matic. Someone paid with apecoin the other day,\u201d he said.\n\nNatividad also has a giant stock ticker mounted to the wall, above four TV screens that play financial news and a livestream on Twitch.\n\nA stock ticker hangs above four television screens that display financial news and a Twitch livestream at The Bagel Exchange in Alhambra, California. (Lily Jamali/Marketplace)\n\nMaking a matcha green tea latte, Natividad said he paid for this place from his own crypto winnings and he\u2019s sticking with it.\n\n\u201cI still believe in Bitcoin and Ethereum. I feel like it\u2019s gonna be around for a while,\u201d Natividad said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bad news going around. Everybody just doesn\u2019t know where to put their money.\u201d\n\nBitcoin \u2014 the standard bearer of crypto \u2014 came out of a period when bad financial news was the norm: the Great Recession. The cryptocurrency came into being in January 2009 after a year of major financial failures.\n\nThis first wave of bank failures since then is a big test for crypto, said David Yermack, chair of the finance department at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business.\n\n\u201cMany of the larger banks appear to be vulnerable. Governments have not been particularly successful at bailing them out and shoring up public confidence,\u201d Yermack said. \u201cThis is exactly the kind of dynamic that the creators of Bitcoin were trying to play into.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s some validation in this moment, per Sheila Warren, CEO of the industry group Crypto Council for Innovation.\n\n\u201cI think people are really feeling like: \u2018This is what we\u2019ve been talking about for so long, guys, right? Look back at 2008 and 2009!\u2019 And now here we are. So I do think there is a quiet kind of recognition of that,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the same time, many crypto enthusiasts and investors worry that regulators are trying to keep money from escaping the traditional banking system right now.\n\n\u201cThere certainly seems to be a concerted effort of closing the exit ramps \u2014 closing the doors on crypto,\u201d said entrepreneur Adam Jackson, founder of Cambrian Asset Management, a cryptocurrency hedge fund, which he launched in 2017.\n\nJackson points to the regulatory clampdown that\u2019s intensified lately. Late last month, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, was sued by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission for running an alleged sham compliance operation. And Coinbase said it was put on notice about potential charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThese developments have only added to the view some have that the financial system\u2019s old guard is coming after crypto.\n\nPeople tend to look for information that validates how they already view the world, said Hilary Allen, professor at the American University Washington College of Law.\n\n\u201cI could see how someone who very much wants to believe that crypto is the successor to traditional finance might interpret what has happened over the last few weeks as confirming that crypto will take over,\u201d Allen said.\n\nRyan Natividad is the owner of The Bagel Exchange in Alhambra, California. He opened up his shop using earnings from his crypto investments. (Lily Jamali/Marketplace)\n\nBut while the latest banking crisis has shown that there are definitely problems in traditional finance, \u201cI think those problems are replicated and exacerbated in the crypto system,\u201d Allen added.\n\nBack at The Bagel Exchange, Ryan Natividad is having one of his regular chats about crypto with Richard Valenzuela, who owns the bar next door.\n\n\u201cI come in here to make fun of him all the time,\u201d Valenzuela said.\n\nEven after all their talks, Valenzuela said crypto makes no sense to him. \u201cPeople are like, \u2018Oh, maybe it is worth something.\u2019 But it\u2019s like, how could something with no intrinsic value appreciate so much? I don\u2019t get that,\u201d Valenzuela said.\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t really get it. But crypto seems to be rallying anyway, as many wait to see what\u2019s next for tech and the larger economy."

        "title": "Bitcoin's Correlation to Gold Tightened in March Amid TradFi Woes - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin behaved more like one of the world\u2019s most historic currencies in March, as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap exhibited a strong correlation to gold.\n\nThe value of the two assets moved in similar directions throughout the month, edging higher as a banking crisis reared its head in the U.S. and toppled several institutions like Silicon Valley Bank\u2014which eventually spilled over to shutter European giants like Credit Suisse.\n\nThe correlation between Bitcoin and gold currently stands around 50%, according to blockchain analytics firm Kaiko. It represents the strongest connection between the two assets in more than a year, Kaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cIt's a significant shift because over the course of 2022 Bitcoin and gold were mostly uncorrelated,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, it was not moving as a safe haven [asset] at all.\u201d\n\nOver the past month, Bitcoin has rallied 25% to around $28,000, notching its third positive month in a row despite regulatory headwinds. Meanwhile, gold has risen over 8% during the past month, nearing an all-time high of`$1,988 per troy ounce on Monday.\n\nBitcoin Is Pumping\u2014But It\u2019s Not Yet 'Decoupling' From Stocks, Analysts Say\n\nCryptocurrencies aren\u2019t typically viewed as a safe haven asset\u2014they\u2019re generally seen as risky investments like stocks. And these risk assets have been hammered over the past year as the Federal Reserve has aggressively raised interest rates to quell inflation.\n\nBut Aubert said it\u2019s possible for Bitcoin\u2019s status as a risk asset to shift somewhat as investors\u2019 perceptions of its strengths as a store of value change.\n\n\u201cFor now, people are trying to put Bitcoin in a very traditional framework,\u201d Aubert said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard because it can be a lot of things.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500\u2014a major index often used to gauge movements in the U.S. stock market\u2014fell significantly in March to 20%, adding on to a trend that\u2019s been building for months, said Aubert.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s correlation with equities has been going down since December, steadily, and it's now very low,\u201d she said, adding that 20% is essentially negligible.\n\nHowever, Aubert said that Bitcoin will remain influenced by factors that also impact stocks, such as the Fed\u2019s monetary policy. She also noted that Bitcoin is sensitive to changes in liquidity overall.\n\nIs Bitcoin Really Decoupling From Stocks? Experts Weigh In\n\nAs Bitcoin begins to behave more like a safe haven asset and less like a risky one, there are some fundamental similarities between Bitcoin and gold that are notable, CoinShares\u2019 Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt.\n\nOne element that the two assets have in common is that a finite supply supports their value, he said. Similar to how there\u2019s a limited amount of accessible gold in the world, Bitcoin\u2019s supply is capped at 21 million\u2014with the last Bitcoin expected to be mined sometime in 2140, according to projections.\n\n\u201cBitcoin, in fact, is technically a harder asset than gold because it's a finite supply, but [also] a very well-known finite supply,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cTheoretically, you could go out into the universe and find a ton of gold, bring it back to Earth, and flood the market.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the cultural overlap between Bitcoin and gold, perhaps there is evidence to suggest they are converging on that front as well.\n\nThe California-based rapper Snoop Dogg stepped into the ring at WrestleMania 39 yesterday and was seen sporting a golden hardware wallet like an expensive chain."

        "title": "Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Dakar, the capital of the West African nation of Senegal, now boasts an annual Pan-African Bitcoin conference, over 10 merchants accepting Bitcoin, a local peer-to-peer BTC exchange and a budding Bitcoin community.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the speed at which Bitcoin\u2019s progress is unwinding is staggering. The city hosted the DakarBTC Days conference just 10 months after the country\u2019s first \u201cin real life\u201d Bitcoin meetup. All of this is despite a brutal bear market that has put a big dent in Bitcoin adoption.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin bubbling in Senegal? Is this country on the path to \u201chyperbitcoinization,\u201d or at least more entrenched Bitcoin adoption and use? Could Senegal be the next country to follow in El Salvador\u2019s footsteps?\n\nI wanted to find out. I had missed out on the inception of Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador in 2019, so I wanted to explore what a bottom-up, Bitcoin-circular economy might look like in West Africa. This is that story so far.\n\nA colonial currency\n\nThe West African Economic and Monetary Union CFA franc is an awful currency. The French created it; they control its conversion rate; they even design and print the notes for use in Africa. A Frenchman sitting in the historic university town of Clermond-Ferrand conjures up the designs in use on CFA notes used by millions of Africans across 13 countries \u2014 despite the fact that they might never have set foot in Africa.\n\nThe CFA is currently pegged to the euro at a fixed rate of 655.957 to one. In 1994, the peg with the former French franc was slashed from 1:505 to 1:100. The currency devaluation, instigated by France and in collaboration with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, wiped out the savings of the Senegalese people. To cap it all off, French officials sit on regional central bank boards across French-speaking Africa and still hold substantial powers, including veto rights.\n\nAlex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation once explained, \u201cUnlike a typical fiat currency, the system was far more insidious. It was monetary colonialism.\u201d\n\nFrom Cuba to Turkey, South Africa to Serbia, I have never seen a greater demand or need for monetary emancipation than in Central or West Africa, and the most likely candidate for West Africa\u2019s economic and monetary freedom is Bitcoin.\n\nMaking lightning connections\n\nOn Twitter in January 2022, I noticed that a few bars in the ex-pat area of Dakar have begun accepting Bitcoin. You can pay for a cr\u00eape or a bissap (a refreshing local drink made with hibiscus flower) over the Lightning Network, at a spitting distance from the beach.\n\nMy thoughts immediately go to El Salvador\u2019s grassroots adoption initiative, Bitcoin Beach, the efforts of which culminated in Bitcoin becoming legal tender in El Salvador. I know at once that I must speak to the person behind these efforts.\n\nA tall, softly-spoken Senegalese man who spent a chunk of his professional life working in France, Nourou (not his real name), is a Bitcoin advocate like no other.\n\nNourou points to the wings of Africa during an interview.\n\nHe returned to Senegal in 2021 and was disappointed to see that his friends and even family members had lost money to \u201cPonzi schemes like Petronpay \u2014 things like that \u2014 or limo\u201d and other popular crypto scams in Africa. \u201cSo, we set up the Bitcoin in Senegal community,\u201d he tells Cointelegraph.\n\n\u201cI was the first one in our first e-meet on Clubhouse. We were maybe three or four, but I kept going with two sessions per week, then one session per week because we used to have 10, 20 [\u2026] sometimes hundreds of people listening in.\u201d\n\nHe arrived in Senegal at the onset of COVID-19. However, the pandemic chaos did not dash his dreams of making Bitcoin the go-to currency in his homeland.\n\nPeer to peer\n\nWhile traveling in Senegal in February 2022, I attended the country\u2019s first-ever Bitcoin meetup. Not only was this a milestone event in of itself \u2014 as previously meetups were conducted online or on the application Clubhouse \u2014 but the caliber of the guests in attendance is jawdropping.\n\nThe room is brimming with nonfungible token promoters, Bitcoin maximalists, entrepreneurs, central bankers and even professors from Dakar\u2019s most prestigious universities. The atmosphere is a stark contrast with the Bitcoin meetups I usually attend in Europe or America, where, to be frank, it\u2019s a bunch of white Millennial males preaching the fall of fiat currencies.\n\n\n\nSenegal\u2019s first in-person BTC meetup in February 2022. Nourou is second from right, while I am fifth from left (back row).\n\nI also see Nourou onboard three more restaurants onto the Bitcoin network. Interestingly, a lot of these merchants use Bitcoin in its purest form: a peer-to-peer cash system.\n\nThey accept Bitcoin-based or Lightning transactions, and they hold onto it with the intent of using Bitcoin as money in a circular economy. Nourou is building an app that allows merchants to cash out into local currency and offers a personalized service where they can get their hands on cash if need be.\n\nI left Senegal in March 2022 with a spring in my step. I felt inspired by the fact that, in the places that need it most, there are enthusiastic Bitcoin people devoting their time and efforts to educating others about money and, ultimately, Bitcoin.\n\nNow, fast-forward to August 2022, and I couldn\u2019t quite believe that Nourou is texting me, saying he had plans to host a Bitcoin forum in Senegal. It will be the first time that Bitcoiners from all over the world would assemble on the African continent to share their passion for Bitcoin and strategize how best to adopt the currency.\n\nI vowed to myself that I absolutely must attend. Not only is this a country that I\u2019m increasingly attached to but I fully want to observe, participate and report on the Bitcoin movements in Senegal and greater West Africa.\n\nDakar Bitcoin Days\n\nDakar Bitcoin Days gathered enthusiasts and economists from across Africa, in a pan-African celebration of magic internet money. From Cameroon to the Congo, Mali to the Ivory Coast and the Central African Republic, there were interested parties from all over the continent. As Nourou says in an interview while pointing at the continent of Africa, \u201cAfrica will fly if we all go together.\u201d\n\nWith Nourou backstage ahead of the start of the conference.\n\nFrance is the official language in Senegal, while Wolof is by far the most widely spoken. One of the unique and well-thought-out aspects of this conference is that there are Dakar Bitcoin Days talks in three languages \u2014 English, French and Wolof \u2014 with events in the latter attracting the highest attendance.\n\nThe conference features beginner-friendly seminars that touch on the economy, finance, security and Bitcoin fundamentals. For experts, panels on cryptography take place, while debates such as \u201cIs Bitcoin Halal?\u201d provide cultural insights into using Bitcoin in Senegal, a 97% Muslim country. Plus, the demographics skew incredibly young: The average age in the country is roughly 19 and the conference is brimming with students and young people.\n\nDuring the conference and in conversations, Nourou shares his vision for Senegal with me. Senegal will lead West Africa out of the darkness of currency colonization, he explains. However, there needs to be a level of decentralization in the messaging regarding Africa:\n\n\u201cI want the message to switch. Africa is not a country \u2014 it is a continent. That\u2019s why we call it Dakar Bitcoin Days: If you come to Senegal, you will meet Senegalese; if you go to Mali, you meet Mali people.\u201d\n\nThere might be some similarities, such as some shared histories and overlapping cultures in Africa, but he explains that Africa is just as varied or more than Europe. Much like Bitcoin, the movement is decentralized. Each region and area of Africa will eventually run with and adopt Bitcoin.\n\nThat\u2019s not to take away from the tremendous sense of Pan-Africanism that Africa benefits from. It\u2019s something that that Europeans or Americans as a continent may not relate to. I am British and European, but I do not relate with a Serbian the way that a Senegalese may relate to a Zimbabwean, despite being thousands of miles apart.\n\nBitcoin in Senegal\n\nDuring the conference, I also set out to interview merchants who accept Bitcoin. I speak to the owner of a French ex-pat bar that has recently begun accepting Bitcoin. Despite being completely new to decentralized currency, the proprietor, Gary, is happy to see new customers coming to his bar thanks to Bitcoin. While we were there, we managed to convince him to accept Bitcoin at his brand-new tattoo parlor.\n\nA tattoo parlor now accepting BTC.\n\nSenegalese surf team coach Ren\u00e9e Laraise managed Pra\u00efnha, the first restaurant to accept Bitcoin. As one of Senegal\u2019s best sporting exports after football (Senegal won the African cup of Nations in 2022), he\u2019s a leader and a trusted voice in the community.\n\nI also interview Mama Bitcoin, who has been trading Bitcoin for fish on the Atlantic coast for the past three years. It\u2019s a visionary move in a country where cash reigns king and banking services are generally for the financially privileged. Banks in West Africa charge high fees and incur strict user requirements: Withdrawing cash, for example, can cost a few dollars.\n\nThroughout my second trip to Senegal, I give out Bitcoin to more than 70 people. The process is simple: I ask them to download a Lightning wallet, usually Wallet of Satoshi, and they tap receive.\n\nThe wallet is custodial, meaning they don\u2019t actually hold the keys to their Bitcoin. As a result, they are trusting that Wallet of Satoshi will not perform a Sam Bankman-Fried and run off with the funds, but for newbies, I think it\u2019s a great place to start.\n\nI send them a few thousand satoshis, which is maybe a dollar or two in Bitcoin. I find it easy to hand out sats in Senegal in comparison with other countries to which I travel. People are eager to get hold of money, and they are eager to learn, trade or simply save with a currency that cannot be debased or stolen in the way that the CFA can.\n\nI give away free Bitcoin to conference-goers. As you can see from onlookers smiling away, it became part of the conference\u2019s entertainment.\n\nI gave away sats on the beaches, on the sidewalk, during the conference, in restaurants and bars, to taxi drivers, and in tips to the hotel staff.\n\nFor the most part, I give Bitcoin to young people, boys and girls aged anything from 16 upward and young men. Whereas the average age in the United States is about 40, Senegal is a very young population. It\u2019s no surprise that a mobile native, internet-based currency would fly if it was given the right to take off in Africa.\n\nIt makes me wonder, Why are people so keen to get hold of Bitcoin here? Well, it\u2019s because, in the West, we buy Bitcoin through exchanges; a select few individuals buy peer-to-peer, and a tiny slither of Bitcoin enthusiasts actually earn Bitcoin. In West Africa, it\u2019s very hard to get your hands on the coin.\n\nWorse still, it\u2019s very hard to secure Bitcoin. None of the established hardware wallets like Ledger, Trezor or ColdCard ship to Senegal. Ledger sponsored the conference and may start shipping to West Africa, but it\u2019s currently a serious pain point.\n\nIn light of these barriers and opportunities, it gives greater credence to the idea that a Bitcoin-circular economy could take off in Senegal. People want Bitcoin; there are no exchanges to buy from, and international tourists coming to Senegal can spend Bitcoin. Bitcoin could, therefore, tread a path to becoming peer-to-peer money, as its white paper intended, in the country.\n\nMobile money meets Lightning\n\nPlus, mobile money networks have taken root and flourished across Africa. First rising to fame in Kenya, where the globally recognized mobile money company M-Pesa was founded, mobile money companies have popped up across Africa like Apple Stores in European cities. Most Africans nowadays have a smartphone \u2014 they might not have regular electricity or access to free drinking water \u2014 but they can get online.\n\nFailing that, it is highly likely that individuals possess an SMS mobile phone: an old-style phone that can send and receive texts. Thanks to mobile money, users can send and receive payments much like a bank transfer. You can simply text your friend\u2019s phone with credit. In Senegal, the biggest mobile payments company is called Wave.\n\nThe Wave logo is found in taxi companies, restaurants, bars and caf\u00e9s. It\u2019s a bit like the Lightning Network, but it\u2019s slower, a lot more expensive, and it uses local currency.\n\nI try to track down an employee at Wave to orange-pill them \u2014 and introduce them to the Bitcoin network \u2014 and as luck would have it, I bump into one in a bar while watching the World Cup. I immediately ask him to download a wallet and sent him some Bitcoin. The internet connectivity was very patchy where we sat, so it wasn\u2019t the best, and it took a few seconds, cue \u201cNetwork Error.\u201d\n\nI connect to the bar\u2019s WiFi and send him the Bitcoin. He was impressed and said he\u2019d come along to the conference the following day, but I didn\u2019t see him again.\n\nThere was a funny moment during the interview with the marketing director from Wave. He shared that he met and hung out with Satoshi in Senegal. Apparently, he was a VC kind of guy who went around, drunk as a skunk, partying and investing in companies.\n\nThe face you make when someone says they know Satoshi.\n\nHowever, it gets me thinking \u2014 you have a country that is accustomed to transacting via mobile phone, using nothing but a mobile number. That\u2019s despite the fact that the UX for mobile money is quite clunky. Yet everyone and their goat (yes, I try to interview a goat about Bitcoin \u2014 see our documentary), knows how to use it.\n\nSenegal has a power-sapping currency, a young, digitally native population, Bitcoin leaders and mentors in respected positions in society, an annual conference, an increasing number of merchants accepting Bitcoin, and as evinced: It is culturally acceptable to send money via mobile phones.\n\nIt\u2019s another instrument in Africa\u2019s Bitcoin toolbelt and a way in which the continent could effectively leapfrog the developed world. Why can\u2019t we leapfrog mobile money with the Lightning Network?"

        "title": "Bitcoin's Stealth Recovery - Coinbase",
        "content": "Summary If a month ago someone had predicted that US$229B would be wiped off the value of US regional banks (threatening financial institutions on both sides of the Atlantic), our best guess would likely not have been bitcoin prices up by 18.5% and the total crypto market cap up 10.7% to $1.15T. The performance of US stocks (proxied by the S&P 500) was comparatively flat in March, dragging the correlation between stock and bitcoin returns from 58% at the start of the year to 25% (i.e. relatively uncorrelated) based on a 65-day rolling window. While the resilience of cryptocurrency returns has been impressive, it belies the impact that banking failures have had on the onramps (offramps) into (out of) the digital asset ecosystem. The loss of Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) and Signet have, for example, constrained market liquidity and widened price differentials across onshore and offshore exchanges that have been difficult to arbitrage away. On the upside, there are banks in the US (as well as the UAE and Switzerland ) that already seem poised to fill the gaps left by Silvergate and Signature. One peculiarity about crypto\u2019s recovery in March is that bitcoin outperformed other digital assets, including ether. We believe the \u201cflight to bitcoin\u201d partly reflects (1) investor concerns regarding the regulatory status of non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies, (2) fundamental arguments that favor digital assets as an alternative to the existing financial system, (3) the approaching end of the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle, and (4) relatively supportive technical factors.\n\nLet bitcoin be bitcoin From a performance perspective, March has mainly been a bitcoin story. Bitcoin has been outperforming its digital asset peers since mid February, but the move accelerated in early March, coinciding with the onset of the US banking turmoil. In a previous report ( \u201cBank mismanagement\u201d , published March 17), we discussed the asset-liability mismatches at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) that led the US government to take decisive action or otherwise risk a potential system-wide bank run among regional banks. In the weeks following that rescue, the gap between bitcoin and the top ten crypto assets by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and ether) has widened considerably (see chart 1). Bitcoin accumulation is evident in the remarkably strong buy ratios of 50-70% last month compared to only 35-50% for ETH, while bitcoin dominance as a percent of the total crypto market cap surged from 43.9% at the end of February to 47.8% at the end of March. Chart 1. BTC outperformance accelerated in March (Index 1 Jan 2023 = 100) On a risk-adjusted basis, bitcoin is outperforming many traditional risk assets too, including US stocks and G10 currencies. For example, bitcoin appreciation is 1.87 standard deviations above the 65-day rolling average compared to only 0.01 standard deviations for the S&P 500 (indicating relatively flat performance) or even a 1.34 sigma for the tech heavy Nasdaq 100. Moreover, the data suggests bitcoin\u2019s daily returns currently look relatively uncorrelated to the S&P 500\u2019s with a correlation coefficient of 25% over a 65-day window compared to 58% at the start of 2023 (or 70% in May 2022). In fact, our correlation matrix (table 1) shows that BTC/USD returns currently share very little relationship with anything other than ETH/USD returns, although its correlation to gold has been on the rise this year from 16% in early January to 26% now.\n\nFundamental resilience Such trends support fundamental arguments that bitcoin still functions as a relatively uncorrelated asset that exists as an alternative and solution to the points of failure witnessed in the existing financial system. In fact, we believe bitcoin has recently been operating as a hedge for some market participants against the vulnerabilities of fractional reserve banking and the potential risks of a more serious credit crunch. Indeed, we have seen bank depositors continuing to migrate their excess (uninsured) deposits from mid-tier regional banks like First Republic and PacWest to larger institutions, creating further centralization pressures. Consequently, we think the risk of shocks may not yet have fully abated. Additionally, the crisis has made banks more hesitant to make new loans or accumulate debt for fear of exacerbating their asset-liability mismatches, while the rotation into money market funds (currently $5.2T) has reduced bank reserves. The latter suggests that the Fed\u2019s reverse repo tool (RRP) is draining more than just the excess liquidity in the system. All of this suggests financial conditions are implicitly tightening, while both business and consumer sentiment deteriorates. That leaves the Federal Reserve much closer to the end of its monetary tightening cycle, which could be another reason why bitcoin has been strengthening as of late. Bitcoin tends to perform better when market participants anticipate looser monetary policy (as reflected by a pronounced drop in forward rates). Many also see the Fed\u2019s Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) as a form of monetary expansion \u2013 even if the majority of those newly created dollars will never enter the real economy \u2013 against which bitcoin could offer some protection. Chart 2. Value in money market funds has climbed to $5.2T Another reason for bitcoin\u2019s outperformance may be the increased regulatory uncertainty surrounding the status of non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies in recent weeks. The most prominent example of this was in a lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James on March 9 against crypto exchange KuCoin (for failing to register its platform in NYS). The lawsuit alleges that ETH (as well other cryptocurrencies including LUNA and UST) are potentially securities under New York\u2019s Martin Act. This coincides with more forceful language from SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a NY Magazine interview published February 23 that he believes \u201ceverything other than bitcoin\u201d are securities because \u201cthere\u2019s a group in the middle and the public is anticipating profits based on that group.\u201d He is scheduled to appear before a House Financial Services committee on April 18 to provide further details about his regulatory approach. On the other hand, CFTC Chair Rostim Benham said in a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing on March 8 that ETH and stablecoins are commodities.\n\nTechnicals and on-chain data Note that technicals have factored into bitcoin\u2019s relative outperformance as well. For example, in February, we discussed the constraints on available bitcoin supply with tokens locked up in government custody or cold storage wallets. This contributed to a deceleration in bitcoin\u2019s velocity from an average of 3.24 in October and November 2022 to 1.36 by December and January. (Velocity declines when more bitcoin are taken out of circulation rather than used for transactions on the network.) As of March, bitcoin velocity has only risen marginally to 1.49, while the number of transactions per active address on the network jumped by an impressive 16.2% last month. See table 1. Comparatively, the transaction count per capita only increased 7.8% on Ethereum, although the smaller increment may have also had to do with the anticipated airdrop of ARB tokens (on March 23), representing optimistic rollup Arbitrum. This led to relatively flat transaction fees on Ethereum relative to the average over the last 12 months and no change in the total value locked between February and March. (That said, ETH supply continues to contract at a 0.30% annualized pace.) In juxtaposition to that, the transaction fees earned by bitcoin miners in March were almost 2.5 standard deviations above the fees earned over the entire preceding 12 months \u2013 bolstered by a more developed trading environment for Ordinals (NFTs or \u201cdigital artifacts\u201d).\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price action was also driven by a massive option expiry on March 31 that accounted for 37.5% of the total open interest. There had been significant upside call buying from lower spot levels leaving dealers short gamma. The significant gamma hedging requirements likely perpetuated the squeeze higher as spot prices trended up. Moreover, the move was likely exacerbated by thin liquidity , driven not only by the effects of the US regional banking turmoil (which has affected all cryptocurrencies broadly) but also specifically by Binance\u2019s termination of its bitcoin zero-fee trading program as of March 22."

The Bitcoin maximalist supports the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s view on altcoins \u2014 that they should be regulated as securities. \u201cTo want to have security regulation for thee, but not for me, which is what the altcoin industry wants, [...] I think it is just hypocritical,\u201d he said.\n\nKlippsten welcomed the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s lawsuit against Binance, which he sees as a net positive for Bitcoin.

        "content": "Hedge fund manager Jesse Myers believes Bitcoin is on its way to a staggering $10 million per BTC.\n\nIn a new interview with Coin Stories, Myers breaks down the math and the timeline behind his big prediction.\n\nMyers says Bitcoin is emerging as a hard and scarce store of value in a world of ever-increasing debt and currency devaluation.\n\n\u201cWe have now entered an era where the value proposition of holding bonds or holding fiat money is very bad, because the national debt and the unfunded liabilities going forward are going to necessitate a level of printing that will outpace the nominal yield on holding bonds.\n\nThat\u2019s the only way out we have. We now have $31 trillion of national debt, $170 trillion of unfunded liabilities in the US alone.\n\nThen you\u2019re talking about $3 trillion a year in interest expense when we\u2019re already running a multi-trillion dollar deficit in our budget. So you\u2019re talking about something like $4 trillion dollars of deficit going forward that you have to print in order to make that up\u2026\n\nSo that\u2019s what Bitcoin is competing with as the lowest hanging fruit, I think in terms of where people have their value parked.\u201d\n\nMyers says Bitcoin is competing in an asset world that totals about $900 trillion in size, with a current level of global crypto adoption that is far less than some analysts believe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of how much can Bitcoin win, how much value can Bitcoin actually take here. It is currently a $400 billion asset in a $900 trillion ocean. That means it\u2019s 1/2000th of the world\u2019s value, and that means collectively the world has a 0.05% percent allocation to Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMyers says Bitcoin\u2019s maximum supply of 21 million BTC will create a massive supply shock as the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s rate of adoption increases.\n\nHe then breaks down the math that brings him to $10 million per BTC in today\u2019s dollar terms, which is centered on Bitcoin capturing half of gold\u2019s market cap as well as additional percentages of the world\u2019s top store of value categories.\n\nAs for his timeline, Myers says the key factor is how long it will take for the general public to gradually learn more about Bitcoin and understand its true value proposition. He believes his price target will become a reality within the next few decades.\n\n\u201cI think we have begun the Bitcoin era, where having BTC as a major if not primary pillar of your personal savings strategy is the winning formula. And it will take a generation for people to really get the picture.\n\nSo when I when I say Bitcoin has, I think, a conservative chance of becoming $10 million dollars a coin in today\u2019s dollars, that means going from 0.05% of the world\u2019s value to 25% of the world\u2019s value.\n\nBitcoin is just going to suck it in, ingest it like a black hole. That\u2019s what I think we\u2019ve embarked on now and it will only be really clear in hindsight that those are the mechanics that were playing out right before people\u2019s eyes while everyone was convinced that this was just Monopoly money.\u201d\n\nAs for the potential risks to Bitcoin\u2019s future, Myers says regulatory roadblocks are a top concern.\n\nHe also believes Bitcoin\u2019s virality is key to its future, and that it\u2019s imperative for those who understand its benefits to spread the word and educate the next wave of investors.\n\nYou can check out the full interview here.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Company mines 598 bitcoin in the month; Ends the first quarter of the calendar year with 1,871 bitcoin mined, up 22% from the prior quarter; 50MW Washington expansion on schedule\n\nExpansion of CleanSpark's Washington, Georgia, Bitcoin Mining Campus is On Schedule\n\nImage of CleanSpark's bitcoin mining facility expansion, currently under construction, in Washington, GA.\n\nExpansion of CleanSpark's Washington, Georgia, Bitcoin Mining Campus is On Schedule\n\nImage of CleanSpark's bitcoin mining facility expansion, currently under construction, in Washington, GA.\n\nLAS VEGAS, April 03, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CleanSpark, Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSK), America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122, today released its unaudited bitcoin mining and operations update for the month ending March 31, 2023.\n\n\u201cOur approach to proprietary mining gives us substantial control and flexibility over our destiny and the progress on our Washington expansion is a perfect example,\u201d said Zach Bradford, CEO. \u201cThe 50MW expansion is on schedule. The machines have already been purchased and shipping is expected to commence this month. Once those machines are racked and the expansion is energized, our hashrate is expected to increase to about 8.7 EH/s, giving us substantial progress toward our calendar year-end goal of 16 EH/s.\n\n\u201cIn this environment, a miner that is not growing is falling behind. As hashrate grows, we also need to grow. Growth takes substantial capital, just as it does in any commodities-based business, especially in the scaling stage. As we scale, we intend to continue to use all capital levers available to us, including equity and bitcoin, carefully balancing both to provide the highest rate of return for our shareholders. We are making the most of the bear market so that we are in position to take full advantage of the next bull market once it inevitably emerges.\u201d\n\nMarch Bitcoin Mining Update (unaudited)\n\nBitcoin mined in March: 598\n\nCY2023 bitcoin mined: 1,871\n\nTotal BTC holdings as of March 31: 196\n\nTotal BTC converted for operations and growth in March: 502\n\nCurrently deployed fleet of about 67,700 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a hashrate of 6.7 EH/s\n\nThe Company funded growth and operations through the sale of 502 bitcoins in March 2023 at an average of approximately $24,800 per BTC. Sales of BTC equated to proceeds of approximately $12.4 million. March daily BTC mined averaged 19.29 and reached a high of 20.25.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperational Update\n\nWashington Expansion. The Washington expansion is a passively cooled data center consisting of four primary buildings. Once fully complete, the expansion will hold about 15,000 Antminer S19j Pro+ machines. Total capacity in Washington is expected to be 86MW, the majority of which is sourced from low-carbon, on-grid energy. Building 1 is complete and ready for miners. Racks are currently being installed in Building 2. The foundation was recently poured for Building 3, while concrete deliveries are imminent for Building 4. Scott Garrison, vice president of business development, is leading the expansion.\n\n\u201cWe are on schedule in Washington,\u201d said Garrison. \u201cOne building is completely done and ready for miners, with the other buildings in various stages of construction, each advancing according to schedule. Our teams and partners, which include the utility, city, and various construction firms, are working hand-in-hand for the build. I\u2019m so proud of what we are accomplishing on the ground in Washington as we work to build some of the most efficient bitcoin mining infrastructure in North America.\u201d\n\nAbout CleanSpark\n\nCleanSpark (Nasdaq: CLSK) is America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122.

        "title": "Bitcoin soars amid banking panic - EL PA\u00cdS USA",
        "content": "The big winner so far this year is bitcoin \u2014 not stocks, gold or oil. In the first three months of 2023, it has jumped 70% in value. This rise has temporarily silenced critics who considered the cryptocurrency to be on its last legs after the chaos of 2022 \u2014 a year which saw the collapse of some of the main players in the crypto sector, including TerraLuna, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius, Voyager and FTX. But market sentiment has since turned around. And after recording constant falls and suffering from the rise in interest rates in the U.S., the cryptocurrency seems to have turned a corner. Bitcoin climbed to $28,000 last week, well above its record low of $15,700, which it recorded in November. The entire crypto universe is currently worth \u20ac1.1 trillion ($1.2 trillion).\n\nSome analysts believe crypto\u2019s rebound is due to the banking panic in March, sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the Credit Suisse takeover by UBS, its main competitor. \u201cConcerns about the centralized banking system increased confidence in decentralized cryptocurrencies, and risk assets were boosted by prospects for a faster fall in inflation and interest rates,\u201d argues Ben Laidler, a global market strategist at the investment platform eToro.\n\nMore information Crypto evangelists enter the Bukele government: The dark business of bitcoin in El Salvador\n\nOne of the side effects of the banking panic was that the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points, instead of the expected 50. Some investors interpreted this decision as a sign to return to the most volatile investments that promise the greatest returns, but come with the greatest risk.\n\nThe crypto community has welcomed this latest blow to financial institutions, considering it payback. For crypto investors, the banking panic in the U.S. and Europe confirms their belief that, in the future, all financial intermediaries will be gone and there will be a decentralized system, in which everyone can move their money without the need for banks.\n\nIn the wake of the panic, many crypto supporters took to social media to revel in the turn of events. \u201cI am old enough to remember when the Credit Suisse CEO said Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin was $7,000 then. Bitcoin is now $28,000. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse is getting acquired by a competitor and being bailed out by central banks,\u201d Gabor Gurbacs, the CEO of PointsVilleApp, posted on Twitter.\n\nKoh Onozawa, co-CEO of the cryptocurrency trading platform Bit2Me, attributes the rise in bitcoin to other factors. \u201cAdoption is growing,\u201d he told EL PA\u00cdS, pointing out that large companies such as Mastercard and Visa have created their own Web3 department, while certain neobanks, such as Revolut, are making cryptocurrency available to their customers. \u201cWith the fall of bad apples, it is more important than ever to use regulated entities,\u201d he said.\n\nBut there is an obstacle threatening to halt the rise of cryptocurrencies: the legal woes of Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange. Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao are being sued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for numerous alleged violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. For example, Binance did not require customers to provide any identity-verifying information. It also communicated with U.S. customers using a messaging platform that automatically deleted written communications, according to the news agency AP.\n\nThe market is now at a turning point. Some investors may opt to collect on their gains, given the uncertain economic context and growing fears of a U.S. recession. They may take a break and wait to see if cryptocurrencies continue on an upward trend. Other investors, however, may hang in rather than sell at a loss. Bitcoin is still worth half what it was in November 2021, when it peaked at $69,000. For those who bought bitcoin at that moment, selling now would mean remaining in the red.\n\nIn addition to recovering economically, cryptocurrencies are also hoping to restore lost confidence. The inflation crisis showed that investing in bitcoin \u2014 contrary to the claims of its supporters \u2014 was not a way to safeguard against rising prices. Now, the crypto community has come back with another argument: that the digital currency is a safe investment given the current problems facing the banking system.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

        "content": "A new daily all-time high has been recorded for the number of Ordinals inscribed on the Bitcoin (BTC) network due to a recently launched \u201ctoken standard\u201d for the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin Ordinals reached 58,179 inscriptions on April 2, smashing the previous all-time high of 31,692 on March 9 by 83.5%, according to Dune Analytics data.\n\nThe surge is believed to be driven by the recent creation of \u201cBitcoin Request for Comment\u201d (BRC-20) tokens on the Ordinals protocol by a pseudonymous on-chain analyst named Domo in early March.\n\nDaily count of Ordinals inscriptions shown in green. Source: Dune Analytics\n\nWhile Ordinals are nonfungible token (NFT)-like \u201cdigital artifacts\u201d which carry data in the form of text, JPEG images, PDFs, video and audio formats on the Bitcoin network, the BRC-20 token standard utilizes Ordinal inscriptions to deploy token contracts, mint tokens, and transfer tokens \u2014 similar to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token standard.\n\nYes. The spike has been primarily caused by the uptick in interest around BRC-20. \u2014 Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) April 2, 2023\n\nThe arrival of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens on Bitcoin were enabled by the Taproot soft fork, which took effect on Nov. 14, 2021.\n\nOver 55,000 of the inscriptions on April 2 came in the form of text-based Ordinals, many of which were represented by BRC-20 tokens, according to \u201cLeonidis.og,\u201d the host of an Ordinals-focused podcast.\n\nBRC-20 tokens \u2014 which are categorized as text-based Ordinals \u2014 are the most commonly inscribed Ordinal on Bitcoin. Source: Dune Analytics.\n\nLeonidis explained in a tweet that the spike on April 2 came on the back of new tools used to interact with BRC-20 tokens launched in the last few days.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of excitement around BRC-20 when it launched a month ago but eventually the hyped died down. During the lull, devs built tools to make interacting with BRC-20 much easier and now we're seeing ATH interest. I've said it before and I will say it again. UX matters!\u201d\n\nAmong those new tools include Ord.io, UniSat Wallet and BRC-20.io. According to BRC-20.io, 1,600 tokens have been created since the BRC-20 standard was created.\n\nAmong the most popular BRC-20 tokens include \u201cpepe,\u201d \u201cordi,\u201d and \u201cpunk,\u201d currently boasting respective market caps of $2.5 million, $2.1 million and $900,000.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals creator looks for fix after first instance of shock porn\n\nOver 42,700 BRC\u201320 tokens have been minted in the last 24 hours, mostly coming from the tokens wzrd, domo, BAYC, meme and pups.\n\nBitcoin tokens, through the BRC-20 standard, can now be bought and sold on marketplaces, similar to Ethereum ERC-20 tokens.

Proponents such as Dan Held suggest it offers more financial use cases on Bitcoin, while others say it\u2019s straying away from Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer cash system.\n\nMagazine: 4 out of 10 NFT sales are fake: Learn to spot the signs of wash trading"

        "content": "The United States Federal Reserve began its most aggressive quantitative tightening efforts in March 2022, raising benchmark interest rates in the year since from near-zero to 4.75% to 5% annually. While the central bank has successfully brought down inflation to some degree, the increasing interest rates are starting to cause cracks in the global banking industry.\n\nThe market expects the Fed to end quantitative tightening and provide favorable liquidity conditions to avoid a global financial crisis as the banks begin to fail. The shift in the Fed\u2019s policy should have significant implications for financial assets.\n\nJurrien Timmer, the director of global macro at Fidelity, discussed the likely impact of the Fed\u2019s dovish pivot on stocks, gold and Bitcoin.\n\nMarket expects the Fed to put an end to interest rate hikes\n\nThe Fed is largely expected to either maintain the interest rates at current levels or start cutting rates.

If the Fed plans to start lowering interest rates and the inflation levels stay elevated, it leads to negative real interest for investors. The earning rate is less than the inflation rate and is, therefore, repressive. Financial repression works more smoothly than raising taxes or cutting spending, but it brings losses for bondholders.\n\nTechnically, gold staged a bullish breakout above the previous peak in 2023, around $1,950. This level also formed a long-term resistance to gold prices, signaling active buyer interest.\n\nTimmer added, \u201cWhen you get all three (negative real rates and positive price and monetary inflation), it\u2019s a bullish trifecta for gold.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is a housing crisis underway? Why crypto investors should care\n\nThe latest Bitcoin rally has seen a rising correlation with gold and a dip in its correlation with the S&P 500 index. Bitcoin and gold are moving in lockstep with a correlation coefficient value of one compared to a low proportional relation of 0.13 with the S&P 500 index.\n\nCorrelation coefficient of Bitcoin-gold (top), and Bitcoin-S&P 500 index (bottom). Source: TradingView\n\nBitcoin is benefiting from the narrative around a potential global banking crisis, strengthening its position as a non-correlated asset like gold. The BTC/USD pair\u2019s positive breakout above $28,000 alongside gold further shows that buying activity is rising.\n\nThus, if the U.S. Fed pivots from the hawkish rate hike regime to a dovish stance, it could create bullish conditions for the market.\n\nWhile the outcome for stock markets hangs in the balance due to inflation risks, gold is expected to shine in the medium term. Given the positive correlation with gold, Bitcoin may also benefit from the macroeconomic setting.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

You\u2019ll be able to use your card immediately for ATM withdrawals. You may also avoid extra bank fees, including withdrawal and transaction fees.\n\nGuide: How to Withdraw Bitcoin to Debit Card\n\nWith so many platforms and methods of accessing your funds, spending your Bitcoin using a debit card may seem complicated. We\u2019re going to guide you through the entire process, from choosing a platform all the way to spending your hard-earned cash.\n\nSelect A Platform That Offers Debit Card Connection\n\nWhile withdrawing Bitcoin to a debit card is now offered through several platforms, not every exchange has this service. You\u2019ll have to check if your chosen platform has this option.\n\nBinance is a popular platform that offers a Sell-to-Card feature. Trastra and Coinbase Card are two alternative exchanges supporting the feature. It\u2019s worth shopping around to find the right platform for you. Be sure to check out the trading fees or other fees terms involved. Some platforms have a daily limit on the amount you can withdraw.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve selected a trading platform, it\u2019s time to create an account. You\u2019ll be asked to go through a verification process, and you may have to conduct an initial transaction.

With other methods available, it\u2019s crucial to include all elements when deciding.\n\nCard & Wallet Compatibility\n\nNot every card supports direct withdrawals. Many cards require you to transfer your fiat cash to your bank account before you can use the card. You\u2019ll have to check if your card is a Visa Fast Funds or MasterCard Send card and if your bank supports the transaction. It also depends on which country you reside in. If unsure, you can contact your bank or debit card provider to find out more.\n\nMany exchanges also only support using their hosted crypto wallets. If you hold your assets in a self-custodial wallet (meaning you hold the keys), you may have to transfer your assets to the exchange. Many crypto traders are wary of moving their assets out of a digital wallet they have complete control over to an exchange where a third party holds the keys.\n\nFees\n\nEach platform will have its own fees, including a conversion fee or on crypto transactions.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) market liquidity has dropped to a 10-month low, despite a bullish quarter in terms of price gain. The liquidity dry-up is partly attributed to the bank run in the United States and the ongoing regulatory actions against crypto companies.\n\nThe liquidity situation in crypto is worsening after the banking fears this month\n\n\n\nI dived into several liquidity metrics to give an update on all things crypto liquidity\n\n\n\nFirst, $BTC liquidity has dropped to 10 month lows as market makers lose access to USD payment rails pic.twitter.com/RwcBEJ8y5Z \u2014 Conor Ryder (@ConorRyder) March 23, 2023\n\nBTC\u2019s price has registered a 45% surge in 2023, making it one of the best-performing assets. The price gains come amid a looming financial crisis in the traditional financial market, with stocks and bonds seeing one of their worst years. As the financial crisis has worsened, several banks have collapsed.\n\nThe banking crisis has also directly impacted the crypto ecosystem. The collapse of crypto-friendly banks, such as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, removed important U.S. dollar payment rails for crypto, leading to a liquidity crisis, especially on U.S. exchanges.\n\nLiquidity on U.S. vs. non-U.S. exchanges. Source: Kaiko\n\nThe crunch in liquidity has also led to increased price volatility forcing traders to pay more fees in slippage. Slippage refers to the price difference between the expected price of a transaction and the price at which it\u2019s fully executed. For a $100,000 sell order, the slippage for the BTC/USD pair on Coinbase climbed by 2.5 times at the beginning of March. During the same time frame, Binance\u2019s BTC/USDT pair\u2019s slippage barely moved.\n\nUSD vs. USDT price slippage. Source: Kaiko\n\nThe liquidity crunch has also led to higher price volatility on U.S. exchanges, where the price discrepancy between BTC and U.S. dollar pairs has increased drastically compared with non-U.S. exchanges. For example, the price of BTC on Binance.US is more volatile than the average price across 10 other exchanges.\n\nBinance.US price difference vs. 10 exchanges. Source: Kaiko\n\nConor Ryder, research head of on-chain data analytics firm Kaiko, explained the drastic impact of the liquidity crisis on traders and the market. He noted that stablecoins are replacing U.S. dollar pairs, and although it lessens the impact of U.S. banking troubles, it has an adverse effect on liquidity in the United States. He added that it would indirectly harm investors there."

        "title": "This is what dedollarization would do to Bitcoin - FXStreet",
        "content": "Share:\n\nThe recent banking crisis dissipated the trust in USD, further fueling the long ongoing dedollarization discourse.\n\nBRICS looking into potentially developing their own rare earth metal-backed currency could decrease global economic dependency on the Dollar.\n\nBitcoin has been regaining its \u201csafe haven\u201d status, and dedollarization could escalate this narrative.\n\nDedollarization is a concept that has been around for a long time now but has only begun taking shape over the last few years. While Crypto was built to be a global currency, independent from other currencies, the devaluation of the US Dollar (USD) might play in its favor, making its aim a reality.\n\nDedollarization: What it is and how it matters\n\nDedollarization is the devaluation faced by the USD due to other currencies taking its place as the world\u2019s reserve currency used for trading Oil and other commodities. The eroding trust in banks and the Federal Reserve is driving countries away from the US Dollar, pushing them to use their own currencies instead. This discussion is heating up more at the moment due to the recent macroeconomic developments.\n\nUSD is becoming weaker by the day as rising inflation and declining geopolitical relations have sent people looking into other options. Many countries, for the same reason, have pulled away from using the Dollar for bilateral trades and have shifted towards their own currencies. China is the biggest country when it comes to using its national currency for trade, as it already has agreements with Australia, Russia, Japan, Brazil, and Iran.\n\nRecently BRICS member Russia\u2019s Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Alexander Babakov also stated that the member countries could create their own currency backed not by gold but land and rare earth metals. Adding to the possibility, Babakov said,\n\n\u201cMost likely, this will be done\u2026Neither the Euro nor the Dollar is backed by anything, and our countries can do what was destroyed by the Bretton Woods system.\u201d\n\nThis could result in USD losing its presence from a major chunk of the global economic activity, further weakening its strength as the use of the likes of the Chinese Yuan could see an increase in settling transactions between countries.\n\nHowever, apart from the Yuan, the weakening of the USD could also act as a boost for cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow Crypto stands to benefit from dedollarization\n\nAt the moment, the USD is the world\u2019s major currency and dedollarization would lead to a reduced circulation of the currency, resulting in lower liquidity. Consequently, the stock market could note a bearish period which usually also impacts the crypto market.\n\nThis is because following the Covid-19 crash, Bitcoin and Crypto\u2019s correlation with the stock market increased. The Nasdaq100 and S&P 500 dictated the digital asset\u2019s path, which took away BTC\u2019s inflation hedge status until the recent banking crisis.\n\nWith the Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate bank and Signature bank failing, Bitcoin decoupled itself from the stock markets and rallied to its current trading price of $28,200. With faith in banks decreasing and the Federal Reserve suggesting higher interest rate hikes going forward the TradFi market could see some bearish effects.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin\u2019s rising correlation with Gold is also rising by the day reaching 0.92 on April 3. Throughout 2022 this correlation stood far lower due to the volatility, but the current conditions strengthen the asset\u2019s safe-haven status, which could drive hyperbitcoinization.\n\nBeginning of hyperbitcoinization?\n\nHyperbitcoinization is known as the transition of Bitcoin into the world\u2019s most dominant form of currency, which many predict is not too far. One of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest supporters, former Coinbase Chief Technical Officer (CTO) Balaji Srinivasan, even went on to make a $1 million bet with pseudonymous Twitter speaker James Medlock on March 17 that BTC would be worth $1 million within the next 90 days.\n\nExplaining this bet, Srinivasan noted that this million-Dollar bet was not about winning or rallying Bitcoin price but about settling the ideological discussion surrounding USD inflation. He explained his statement by saying,\n\n\u201cI believe Medlock will agree that this is an ideological bet, like the Simon-Ehrlich bet, which resolved a famous difference of opinion between libertarians and progressives.\u201d\n\nWhile many consider this to be just a publicity stunt, Balaji himself stated that his declining faith in banks and belief in Bitcoin is what drove him to make the bet in the first place."

I promise funds r safe and they will clear soon \u2014 Ray Youssef (@raypaxful) April 4, 2023\n\nYoussef claimed that Paxful\u2019s senior staff were largely driven away from the company because of actions taken by the unnamed co-founder\u2019s legal team. Youssef added that the co-founder refused to pay some of Paxful\u2019s employees.\n\n\u201cHis litigation team was really nasty,\u201d he said. \u201cThey drove away all of our senior-level staff who just couldn't deal with this guy anymore.\u201d\n\nBy this past Friday, it had gotten to the point where there were no engineers, compliance team members, or security personnel left working at the company, Youssef said. Ultimately, he said he decided at that point to shut the company down due to security concerns.\n\nYoussef claimed he subsequently hired an engineering team to assume control of Paxful\u2019s digital wallet\u2014presumably still being used for safekeeping funds. He said it was the right thing to do, even though it conflicted with a court order that he\u2019s received.\n\n\u201cI've managed over the weekend to get an engineering team to secure everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to make an ethical decision.\u201d\n\n'Integrity Over Revenue' Says Paxful CEO After Booting Ethereum From Platform\n\nPaxful was originally founded in 2015, and it is the latest firm to succumb in the midst of crypto winter. The company is headquartered in New York and has offices in Estonia, the Philippines, and Russia, according to a press release.\n\nAt one point, the company allowed customers to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2014the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization\u2014along with the leading stablecoin Tether. But the company dropped support for Ethereum last December.\n\nYoussef said that Paxful was ultimately successful in the sense that it fostered Bitcoin adoption in West Africa and other areas of the Global South. According to Coin Dance, trading volume on Paxful totaled around $35 million in the past week, with users based in countries like Argentina, Kenya, and India."

        "title": "Bitcoin Volatility Index's Correlation With Price Flips Positive, Boosts Appeal of Bullish Call Options - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nCrypto options exchange Deribit's forward-looking bitcoin volatility index (DVOL) offers clues about the market's expectations for price turbulence over the next 30 days, just as the Chicago Board Options Exchange's volatility index, VIX, does for equities.\n\nA key difference has emerged this year. While the VIX continues to serve as Wall Street's fear gauge, rising during bouts of risk aversion, the DVOL has developed a positive correlation with the cryptocurrency's price. The 30-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin's price and the DVOL index flipped positive in early January and rose to a high of 0.85 last week. At press time, the coefficient was 0.72. That has made call options tied to bitcoin (BTC) more attractive than ever, according to observers.\n\n\"Since the start of 2023, bitcoin has displayed a strong spot/implied volatility regime of positive correlation. That has flipped 2022 on its head,\" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto data provider Amberdata, told CoinDesk. \"It's been rewarding call buyers with directional spot gains and increasing volatility gains.\"\n\nDVOL, introduced in early 2021, measures bitcoin's 30-day implied or expected volatility using Deribit's options order book. The VIX is based on the options prices of the S&P 500 stock index.\n\nOptions are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, a signal the holder has a bullish stance, while a put option gives the right to sell. Options prices are determined by several factors, including market direction as well as implied volatility, which is influenced by the supply and demand for options.\n\nDVOL's positive correlation with the cryptocurrency's price means call options stand to benefit from both favorable directional movement and an uptick in implied volatility. In other words, calls are likely to see faster price appreciation during bullish moves than puts during bearish moves.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Assuming the spot/vol correlation persists, this raises the appeal of owning calls as a call buyer can hit a 'double whammy,' winning on both Delta [directional gains] and Vega [implied volatility gains] in a sharply rising market,\" Spencer Hallarn, an over-the-counter trader at crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR, told CoinDesk.\n\nCaught off guard\n\nThe positive correlation is in stark contrast to last year, when bitcoin's turn lower after an 18-month bullish trend caught traders off guard, leading to panic buying of put options. At the time, DVOL spiked during notable price declines and puts saw faster price appreciation during bearish price action than calls during corrective rallies.\n\nCBOE's VIX index rises during bearish market environments and falls or holds steady when the market rallies. That's because stock traders tend to be long-term bullish and are quick to snap up puts for protection on the first signs of weakness in the stock market. Demand for protection dissipates when the market rallies, leading to a decline in the VIX. The net effect is that puts see faster appreciation in value during market swoons than calls do during risk-on trends.\n\nDVOL acted as a fear gauge in 2022, spiking during notable price sell-offs. The situation has changed this year with implied volatility moving in lockstep with the cryptocurrency's price.\n\nBitcoin rallied almost 70% in the first three months of the year, contradicting expectations for a continued market decline. According to OTC tech platform Paradigm, funds have been piling into bullish positions via options.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, could soon kick in, driving stronger demand for options and pushing DVOL higher.\n\n\"The crypto market can sometimes spike up and everybody then wants to be fully in it (FOMO, especially since we came down from the $68K level),\" Pierino Ursone, head of options at Deribit, said while explaining DVOL's positive correlation with the price. \"When extra demand for out-of-the-money higher strike calls kicks in for crypto, one should beware it can be really strong and persevering.\""

Of that, they say, one-fourth will go into the lunar stash; the same amount again will fund a \u201cCommunity Marketing Wallet\u201d dedicated to funding Bitcoin core development and STEM education-related causes (the destination of the other half of the total is left to our imaginations).\n\nIt's arguably something of a gamble to count on NFTs \u2013 a medium that is equally as famous for its flops and failures as its successes at this point. Worldwide interest in the once-Zeitgeisty tech has pretty much never been lower, with the average price dropping by close to 90 percent last year to well below the $250 price tag asked by LunarCrush.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile $1.5 million may sound like an enticing bounty, it pales in comparison to what a jaunt to the moon would likely cost, at least using current tech. It was less than a year ago that NASA boasted of how cheap its upcoming CAPSTONE moon mission was set to be \u2013 a trifle at just under $10 million. Even at that price tag, NASA isn't sending up any astronauts or rovers \u2013 just a single, microwave-oven-sized robotic probe that is only designed to orbit.\n\nOf course, the teams behind the Bitcoin campaign refuse to let a simple thing like the limits of current human progress cow their aspirations: \u201cWhen you put out a seemingly unachievable goal, the innovation that happens can be incredible,\u201d said Joe Vezzani, CEO of LunarCrush, in a statement for PR Newswire.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to inspire people to build communities that will unlock a new era of exploration,\u201d he said. \u201cWe envision classrooms, groups, companies, and even DAOs [decentralized autonomous organizations, referring to an organization running on blockchain] coming together to reach the Moon and split the treasure chest's rewards. It's like Willy Wonka's \u2018golden ticket\u2019 for the Web3 era, and we couldn't be more excited to see how it all unfolds.\u201d\n\nIt's a surprising comparison: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is pretty famously a rags-to-riches story about how the purity of heart can triumph over greed and determination. Should anybody end up winning the stash of Bitcoin, on the other hand, they\u2019ll need to be the kind of person or group able to drop at least seven figures on a pet project that will, perhaps, earn them back 10 percent of their spend.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSo, less Charlie, more Veruca Salt. And we all know how that ended up, don\u2019t we?"

        "title": "Bitcoin\u2019s Correlation to Gold Tightened in March Amid TradFi Woes - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin behaved more like one of the world\u2019s most historic currencies in March, as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap exhibited a strong correlation to gold.\n\nThe value of the two assets moved in similar directions throughout the month, edging higher as a banking crisis reared its head in the U.S. and toppled several institutions like Silicon Valley Bank\u2014which eventually spilled over to shutter European giants like Credit Suisse.\n\nThe correlation between Bitcoin and gold currently stands around 50%, according to blockchain analytics firm Kaiko. It represents the strongest connection between the two assets in more than a year, Kaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert told Decrypt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt's a significant shift because over the course of 2022 Bitcoin and gold were mostly uncorrelated,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, it was not moving as a safe haven [asset] at all.\u201d\n\nOver the past month, Bitcoin has rallied 25% to around $28,000, notching its third positive month in a row despite regulatory headwinds. Meanwhile, gold has risen over 8% during the past month, nearing an all-time high of`$1,988 per troy ounce on Monday.\n\nCryptocurrencies aren\u2019t typically viewed as a safe haven asset\u2014they\u2019re generally seen as risky investments like stocks. And these risk assets have been hammered over the past year as the Federal Reserve has aggressively raised interest rates to quell inflation.\n\nBut Aubert said it\u2019s possible for Bitcoin\u2019s status as a risk asset to shift somewhat as investors\u2019 perceptions of its strengths as a store of value change.\n\n\u201cFor now, people are trying to put Bitcoin in a very traditional framework,\u201d Aubert said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard because it can be a lot of things.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500\u2014a major index often used to gauge movements in the U.S. stock market\u2014fell significantly in March to 20%, adding on to a trend that\u2019s been building for months, said Aubert.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s correlation with equities has been going down since December, steadily, and it's now very low,\u201d she said, adding that 20% is essentially negligible.\n\nHowever, Aubert said that Bitcoin will remain influenced by factors that also impact stocks, such as the Fed\u2019s monetary policy. She also noted that Bitcoin is sensitive to changes in liquidity overall.\n\nAs Bitcoin begins to behave more like a safe haven asset and less like a risky one, there are some fundamental similarities between Bitcoin and gold that are notable, CoinShares\u2019 Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt.\n\nOne element that the two assets have in common is that a finite supply supports their value, he said. Similar to how there\u2019s a limited amount of accessible gold in the world, Bitcoin\u2019s supply is capped at 21 million\u2014with the last Bitcoin expected to be mined sometime in 2140, according to projections.\n\n\u201cBitcoin, in fact, is technically a harder asset than gold because it's a finite supply, but [also] a very well-known finite supply,\u201d Butterfill said. \u201cTheoretically, you could go out into the universe and find a ton of gold, bring it back to Earth, and flood the market.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the cultural overlap between Bitcoin and gold, perhaps there is evidence to suggest they are converging on that front as well.\n\nThe California-based rapper Snoop Dogg stepped into the ring at WrestleMania 39 yesterday and was seen sporting a golden hardware wallet like an expensive chain.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Toronto police investigators say they have recovered a portion of funds lost by a senior who fell victim to a bitcoin scam that cheated he and his wife out of $400,000.\n\nIn a news release issued Tuesday, police said the couple wanted to invest their savings and were allegedly approached online by a scammer who communicated with them over the phone.\n\nPolice say the scammer presented as \"professional and knowledgeable in the field\" and asked the man to invest in an online platform called \"cryptos-seed.com.\"\n\nThe couple was then persuaded to send funds via a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange to a cryptocurrency wallet provided by the scammer, according to investigators.\n\nPolice say the man was then provided with credentials for the scam website where it appeared his investment was growing \"significantly,\" when in fact, he had sent his money directly to the person in question.\n\nThe man eventually asked to withdraw his funds, but was met with multiple excuses and was told to invest more money or pay large fees to have the funds released, police say.\n\nInvestigators were able to recover a \"significant portion of lost funds\" and return them to the couple, though the news release does not state exactly how much money was lost.\n\nPolice say investigators are still trying to identify the suspects involved, who may be located in another country.\n\nInvestigators are appealing to anyone who believes they may have been a victim of a similar scam to contact police.\n\nTips on how to avoid being scammed\n\nDet. Const. Sean Vandecamp says scams like this are very common. He is urging the public to be cautious when solicited online for any investments.\n\n\"It is not likely that the funds are recovered via cryptocurrency, that's why this is such a great success story,\" he said in an interview with CBC Toronto.\n\nIt's not just crypto \u2014 a recent CBC Toronto investigation revealed that fraud reports in Ontario have skyrocketed over the last decade, with only a sliver of annual reports leading to criminal charges. Those scams include everything from Ponzi schemes, to romance scams and fraudsters selling people's houses out from under them.\n\nAndreas Park, a professor of finance at the University of Toronto, says crypto users are particularly vulnerable because they can hold their assets in self custody and, as a result, are free to send their money to anyone they want.\n\n\"With this great freedom that you have comes the responsibility \u2014 and the problem \u2014 that if you send it to the wrong person, it's just gone,\" he said.\n\nPark says the best way to combat the problem is with education around crypto scams.\n\n\"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,\" he said.\n\nVanessa Iafolla, a fraud prevention consultant and instructor at Wilfred Laurier University, agrees.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency is designed to be anonymous. It's designed to be something that's meant to be difficult to trace,\" she said.\n\n\"If you're not familiar with cryptocurrency, don't touch it. Educate yourself, speak with someone who's part of a legitimate organization.\"\n\nPark urges people to consider holding their assets with a registered investment company like Wealthsimple. If people decide to keep their assets in their own digital wallet, he encourages them to use what's known as a \"hard wallet\" \u2014 a psychical device that stores a person's private keys and allows them to securely access their cryptocurrency.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ontario Securities Commission has a list of registered and approved cryptocurrency exchanges that can be found on its website."

On-chain data indicates that in the medium term the upward momentum may be maintained although a correction after impressive gains in Q1 2023 seems likely.\n\nBitcoin's spot price is currently well above the average blockchain BTC purchase price i.e. Realized Price (around $19,800). According to Glassnode, the cryptocurrency market is currently in a key transition phase between a bull market and a bull market. The upper limit of this phase is marked by the Realized Price to Liveliness Ratio in the vicinity of $33,000, which could be an important resistance level. Source: Glassnode\n\nThe ratio compares the value of BTC held by long-term investors in one cycle (6m-2y) to short-term holders (1d-3m). The structure of the RHODL indicator indicates a sharp change in trend that began with the collapse of FTX, with BTC sold by long-term investors to a new group of buyers. The sudden drop in the index in earlier cycles was seen as a turning point. Source: Glassnode The indicator measures the change in supply based on the length of time BTC is held in portfolios. It is positive (green) when BTC 'ages' at a faster rate (low propensity to sell) and negative (red) when the rate of sales exceeds the accumulation and conviction rate of HODLers. The period of spending was relatively short-lived (the collapse of FTX) and we again see a green color advantage with more than 60,000 BTC added to HODLers' balances per month.

        "content": "What's driving the bitcoin ATM market? There are several factors to consider including security and accessibility. However, there are also issues holding it back. Let's take a look at both.\n\nBitcoin ATMs have quickly become a ubiquitous staple in many retail spaces. You can find them in places ranging from gas stations to supermarkets. In fact, there are now more than 37,000 machines in operation worldwide, according to CoinATMRadar.\n\nThere are multiple factors driving this growth, including accessibility.\n\n\"Bitcoin ATMs are still a popular investing avenue for consumers because they offer accessibility in an industry that otherwise still has high barriers to entry,\" Gabriella Kusz, CEO of the Global Digital Asset and Cryptocurrency Association, said in an email interview. \"As more people become interested in buying crypto with cash, the easy-to-use, familiar technology allows consumers to securely expand and diversify their portfolio. Bitcoin ATMs offer a safe alternative to buying cryptocurrency, taking various steps to mitigate fraud risk and implement safeguards for investors. As the demand for bitcoin ATMs continues to grow, we will likely continue to see them placed everywhere from bustling cities to quiet suburbs.\"\n\nBitcoin ATMs are also easier to use on the retailer's side as well, while also providing a profit.\n\n\"The regulatory environment for cryptocurrency varies from country to country, but in many places, there are few restrictions on bitcoin ATMs. This has made it easier for operators to set up new machines and expand their networks,\" Mark Fidelman, founder of SmartBlocks, said in an email interview. \"Bitcoin ATMs can be a profitable business for operators, as they often charge a percentage fee on transactions. As more people use bitcoin ATMs, the potential for profits increases, which can encourage more investment in the market.\"\n\nThe security side is also important as users can more easily make transactions on bitcoin ATMs and ensure the cryptocurrency stays on their own wallets, rather than having to go through an online exchange.\n\n\"Some people prefer to use Bitcoin ATMs for the privacy they offer. Unlike some online exchanges, Bitcoin ATMs do not require users to provide personal information, which can be appealing to those who want to keep their transactions anonymous,\" Fidelman said.\n\nHowever, there are also some issues within the bitcoin ATM industry. For one, the growth of bitcoin ATMs has slowed down significantly \u2014 in some cases many bitcoin ATMs being removed. On Feb. 28, for example, there was a net reduction of 1,061 bitcoin ATMs. In addition, the speed of installations has dropped, currently sitting at around three deployed per day, according to CoinATMRadar.\n\nThere have been several suggestions as to why the market is being held back. One is that despite it being simpler than some cryptocurrency companies, there is still a lack of regulatory clarity.\n\n\"While the regulatory environment for cryptocurrency is generally becoming more favorable, there is still a lack of clarity in some jurisdictions regarding the legality and regulation of Bitcoin ATMs. This can create uncertainty for operators and potential users of the machines,\" Fidelman said.\n\nOne example of this is the recent push by the Financial Conduct Authority of the U.K. to crack down on unregistered crypto ATMs. The authority is claiming cryptocurrency ATMs in the country are not registered, which can lead to money laundering. In the U.K., all cryptocurrency companies must register with the FCA.\n\nFidelman said other factors holding back the industry include limited acceptance of cryptocurrency, high transaction fees and security concerns.\n\nThere is also the issue of a major bankruptcy in the industry. Recently, Cash Cloud, the operator of Coin Cloud ATMs filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada. The company was in debt for an amount between $100 million and $500 million.\n\n\"The recent bankruptcy of Coin Cloud, a Bitcoin ATM operator, has raised concerns about the overall health of the Bitcoin ATM industry. Some industry experts suggest that the bankruptcy of Coin Cloud may be an indicator of a larger issue in the Bitcoin ATM market,\" Fidelman said.\n\n\"The industry is relatively new and rapidly evolving, with many operators lacking the experience, financial backing, or business acumen needed to succeed in a competitive market. Furthermore, the regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrency is often uncertain, presenting challenges to Bitcoin ATM operators. However, despite the challenges, the Bitcoin ATM market has continued to grow in recent years, with an increasing number of machines being deployed worldwide, and more people using them to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Thus, while the bankruptcy of Coin Cloud has raised concerns, some analysts view it as an isolated incident, rather than a reflection of broader issues in the industry.\"\n\nLastly, a major issue that needs to be addressed is educating the public on cryptocurrency. While it has become more mainstream, many businesses are unaware of the benefits of deploying a bitcoin ATM.\n\n\"Despite industry shakeups, investors are still interested in crypto but often don't know where to start,\" Kusz said. \"Even though bitcoin ATMs employ simple to use technology, companies still need to offer guidance and education within the crypto space to ensure that new investors are making educated decisions that align with their financial goals. In providing two-way communication and trustworthy customer support, companies can encourage return customers and increase participation in the DeFi community.\""

(Nasdaq: CLSK), America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122, today released its unaudited bitcoin mining and operations update for the month ending March 31, 2023.\n\n\u201cOur approach to proprietary mining gives us substantial control and flexibility over our destiny and the progress on our Washington expansion is a perfect example,\u201d said Zach Bradford, CEO. \u201cThe 50MW expansion is on schedule. The machines have already been purchased and shipping is expected to commence this month. Once those machines are racked and the expansion is energized, our hashrate is expected to increase to about 8.7 EH/s, giving us substantial progress toward our calendar year-end goal of 16 EH/s.\n\n\u201cIn this environment, a miner that is not growing is falling behind. As hashrate grows, we also need to grow. Growth takes substantial capital, just as it does in any commodities-based business, especially in the scaling stage. As we scale, we intend to continue to use all capital levers available to us, including equity and bitcoin, carefully balancing both to provide the highest rate of return for our shareholders. We are making the most of the bear market so that we are in position to take full advantage of the next bull market once it inevitably emerges.\u201d\n\nMarch Bitcoin Mining Update (unaudited)\n\nBitcoin mined in March: 598\n\nCY2023 bitcoin mined: 1,871\n\nTotal BTC holdings as of March 31: 196\n\nTotal BTC converted for operations and growth in March: 502\n\nCurrently deployed fleet of about 67,700 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a hashrate of 6.7 EH/s\n\nThe Company funded growth and operations through the sale of 502 bitcoins in March 2023 at an average of approximately $24,800 per BTC. Sales of BTC equated to proceeds of approximately $12.4 million. March daily BTC mined averaged 19.29 and reached a high of 20.25.\n\nOperational Update\n\nWashington Expansion. The Washington expansion is a passively cooled data center consisting of four primary buildings. Once fully complete, the expansion will hold about 15,000 Antminer S19j Pro+ machines. Total capacity in Washington is expected to be 86MW, the majority of which is sourced from low-carbon, on-grid energy. Building 1 is complete and ready for miners. Racks are currently being installed in Building 2. The foundation was recently poured for Building 3, while concrete deliveries are imminent for Building 4. Scott Garrison, vice president of business development, is leading the expansion.\n\n\u201cWe are on schedule in Washington,\u201d said Garrison. \u201cOne building is completely done and ready for miners, with the other buildings in various stages of construction, each advancing according to schedule. Our teams and partners, which include the utility, city, and various construction firms, are working hand-in-hand for the build. I\u2019m so proud of what we are accomplishing on the ground in Washington as we work to build some of the most efficient bitcoin mining infrastructure in North America.\u201d\n\nAbout CleanSpark\n\nCleanSpark (Nasdaq: CLSK) is America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nPeer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace Paxful has announced that it will shut down, directing users to retrieve their funds from its platform.\n\n\u201cThis will probably come as a shock to many,\u201d Paxful co-founder and CEO Ray Youssef wrote in a blog post. \u201cAll customer funds are accounted for. Please withdraw them and, if you can, self-custody.\u201d\n\nBitcoin peer-to-peer markets are getting getting a lot more pressure. @paxful just suspended its marketplace. pic.twitter.com/UKLkICZcfm \u2014 calle \u26a1\ufe0f (@callebtc) April 4, 2023\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe blog post cited \"key staff departures\" and \"regulatory challenges for the industry,\" but Youssef said during a Twitter space on Tuesday that the decision to close the platform was also influenced by a lawsuit brought by a Paxful co-founder who is suing Paxful and Youssef after being \u201ckicked out of the company\u201d more than a year ago.\n\n\u201cMy co-founder sued the company and sued me,\u201d Youssef said. \u201cI have a lawsuit over my head right now.\u201d\n\nThough he did not name the plaintiff explicitly, Youssef is likely referring to co-founder Artur Schaback, who filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against Youssef in January, according to a court docket hosted on CourtConnect.\n\nSchaback could not be reached for comment by Decrypt.\n\n\u201cPaxful is a nominal defendant in the litigation, so we cannot share much around the case,\u201d a Paxful spokesperson told Decrypt, also declining to identify the plaintiff. \u201cBut I can confirm that Artur Schaback is a co-founder and current board member of Paxful.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe announcement of Paxful\u2019s closure comes just days after Youssef promised to make Paxful Earn customers whole. The service had allowed Paxful customers to earn a yield on Bitcoin through a partnership with Celsius, a prominent crypto lender that filed for bankruptcy last July.\n\nThe Paxful spokesperson told Decrypt that, despite the company\u2019s impending closure, Paxful\u2019s wallet is operational, and \u201cusers can get their funds out safely.\u201d\n\nPaxful database is a bit overloaded now as everyone is withdrawing funds. It is making transfers slow. I promise funds r safe and they will clear soon \u2014 Ray Youssef (@raypaxful) April 4, 2023\n\nYoussef claimed that Paxful\u2019s senior staff were largely driven away from the company because of actions taken by the unnamed co-founder\u2019s legal team. Youssef added that the co-founder refused to pay some of Paxful\u2019s employees.\n\n\u201cHis litigation team was really nasty,\u201d he said. \u201cThey drove away all of our senior-level staff who just couldn't deal with this guy anymore.\u201d\n\nBy this past Friday, it had gotten to the point where there were no engineers, compliance team members, or security personnel left working at the company, Youssef said. Ultimately, he said he decided at that point to shut the company down due to security concerns.\n\nYoussef claimed he subsequently hired an engineering team to assume control of Paxful\u2019s digital wallet\u2014presumably still being used for safekeeping funds. He said it was the right thing to do, even though it conflicted with a court order that he\u2019s received.\n\n\u201cI've managed over the weekend to get an engineering team to secure everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to make an ethical decision.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPaxful was originally founded in 2015, and it is the latest firm to succumb in the midst of crypto winter. The company is headquartered in New York and has offices in Estonia, the Philippines, and Russia, according to a press release.\n\nAt one point, the company allowed customers to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2014the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization\u2014along with the leading stablecoin Tether. But the company dropped support for Ethereum last December.\n\nYoussef said that Paxful was ultimately successful in the sense that it fostered Bitcoin adoption in West Africa and other areas of the Global South. According to Coin Dance, trading volume on Paxful totaled around $35 million in the past week, with users based in countries like Argentina, Kenya, and India."

        "title": "Crypto could eliminate 97% of traditional remittance fees: Coinbase - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "A recent blog post from cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase indicates the vast majority of United States remittance fees for international transfers wouldn\u2019t apply to similar transactions conducted using cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to the exchange\u2019s research, \u201cThe US average fee rate of 6.18%, means Americans' average yearly spend is likely close to $12 billion on remittance fees.\u201d The post goes on to state that the average transaction time for such remittances ranges from one to 10 days, while similar cryptocurrency transactions usually take around 10 minutes.\n\nRemittance payments represent a sort of \u201cdouble whammy\u201d for international transactions as, typically, they require both a sending fee and a conversion fee to exchange between currencies.\n\nCryptocurrency transactions, however, tend to cost significantly less. According to Coinbase, Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees average approximately $1.50 and Ether (ETH) averages $0.75. Such fees are potentially much lower than traditional remittance fees, which, according to 6he World Bank, average 6.3%. By Coinbase\u2019s estimates, sending money via BTC and ETH is 96.7% cheaper than traditional remittance methods.\n\nWhile the report doesn\u2019t appear to have the rigor of a scientific study, it does illuminate some of the difficulties faced by the more than 1 billion people who rely on remittances and how global cryptocurrency adoption could change the financial landscape. U.S. senders, for example, were responsible for 94.9% of all remittances sent to Mexico in 2022, according to Wilson Center, a D.C.-based research institute.\n\nRelated: 9 years after the first Bitcoin ATM, there are now 38,804 globally\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that approximately 6% of U.S. adults currently hold some form of cryptocurrency with adoption rates continuing to rise since at least 2019 \u2014 with the exception of two quarters\u2019 worth of downturn at the end of 2022. If these rates can increase or maintain the status quo, a trickling exodus from traditional remittances to cryptocurrency-based international transactions could eventually disrupt how the global financial industry handles associated fees."

        "title": "Best and Worst Performing ETFs in March - Morningstar",
        "content": "Every month we check on how various exchange traded products (ETPs) are doing, and in March, the list of best performers was topped by Bitcoin Tracker One XBT Provider (0PTL).\n\nIndeed, shortly after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month, the price of Bitcoin soared above $25,000, reaching a threshold the digital currency hadn\u2019t touched since June. At the end of March, Bitcoin reached nearly $30,000, up 70% for the year.\n\nAs we explained in a recent interview, Bitcoin was among several cryptocurrencies profiting from the banking crisis, but other structural factors helped drive the rally too.\n\nEli\u00e9zer Ndinga, Director of Research at 21Shares, told us that the narrative of Bitcoin being an alternative to existing financial systems is emerging again due to rising interest rates and the fall in bond prices. Plus, cryptocurrencies are seeing additional use cases and applications like NFTs and smart contracts.\n\n\u201cThese two tailwinds really benefited the price action of crypto assets,\u201d Ndinga says.\n\nTop Performing ETFs\n\nAnother clear group winning out in March was ETFs exposed to gold and related mining stocks, with no less than eight trackers exposed to this sector within the Top 12.\n\nThe benchmark London spot gold broke through the $2,000-an-ounce level on March 20, the highest price seen in the past 12 months. There is a long-standing relationship between the economic crisis and the price of gold. When there is uncertainty in the economy, investors tend to turn to gold as a safe-haven asset, which drives up its price.\n\nBeyond events in the banking sector, this rally is arguably also associated with the uncertainty around the US Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hike moves. In this context, precious metal mining stocks tend to follow the direction of precious metal spot prices, usually amplifying its movements.\n\nWorst Performing ETFs\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the list of worst performing ETFs is topped by the iShares S&P U.S. Banks ETF (BNKS)\u2013which is exposed to the American banking sector. The panic following the collapse of two regional lenders Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank spread like wildfire among investors concerned about possible systemic consequences.\n\nNatural gas ETCs also suffered. Lower demand helped depress gas prices in Europe from an all-time high of \u20ac340 last August to \u20ac42 at the end of March. Moreover, the success the EU has had in lowering gas consumption has reduced the short-term call on US LNG to close supply gaps. The resulting price decline meant US-EU gas spreads collapsed and investors in Exchange-traded commodities sold out. To read more about this, read our recent analysis.\n\nFinally, the fact that UBS\u2019s Credit Suisse rescue deal included a write-off of CHF 16 billion in Additional Tier-1 (AT1) capital to zero, shook bond funds and ETFs exposed to the asset class. In the bottom performer list, we find Invesco AT1 Capital Bond ETF (AT1) and WisdomTree AT1 CoCo Bond UCITS ETF - USD Acc (COCB), which lost 16.7% and 15.2%, respectively.\n\nBiggest ETFs in March\n\nMonthly top and flop performers often coincide with very volatile and therefore risky products, which should play a satellite role in your portfolio. As such, we also include an overview of the biggest European-domiciled ETPs in terms of assets, which could be more appropriate to consider among core holdings. Performance in March 2023 range from 6.2% for the iShares Physical Gold ETC (IGLN), down to the iShares Core FTSE 100 UCITS ETF GBP Dist (ISF),which lost 2.5%.\n\nTab Biggest here\n\nMethodology\n\nAccording to Morningstar data, there are about 48 percentage points between the best and worst performing Exchange-traded products (ETPs) in March, with returns for the month ranging from 20.6% to -27.4%.\n\nWe have looked at the key trends in the third month of the year, excluding inverse and leveraged funds. These instruments, being purely passive products, reflect the evolution of the markets without the bias (good or bad) of an active manager."

        "content": "With Easter approaching, Bugatti is teaming up with Asprey and Metagood to create a one-of-a-kind luxury collection of metal object eggs, each paired with a digital NFT counterpart.\n\nAsprey Bugatti Egg Collection\n\nThe eggshell of the Royale Edition is made from carbon fiber and is encased within a sterling silver diamond weave lattice, gently angled downwards to a curved base portraying movement.\n\nThe surface of the egg itself displays a \u201cDancing Elephant\u201d motif, recreated in perfect detail from one of Rembrandt Bugatti\u2019s original sculptures. The intricate lattice and carbon fiber shell opens with a complex hinged diamond door to reveal a scene of the Chateau Saint Jean, the iconic home of Bugatti in Molsheim, France.\n\nThe NFT and the sculpture are linked by the equation of the egg shape of the actual sculpture.\n\nWiebke Stahl, Managing Director at Bugatti International, said the creation of the Asprey Bugatti Egg Collection is a wonderful homage to the company\u2019s history and the creations of Ettore Bugatti.\n\nAli Walker, Chief Creative Officer at Asprey Studio, said the generative art \u2013 coded by strategic partner and Bitcoin experts Metagood \u2013 using the equation of the egg shape of the actual sculpture as an NFT in Bitcoin is a new form of expression and art itself.\n\nThe Royale Edition of the Asprey Bugatti Egg Collection is inspired by Carlo Bugatti\u2019s quote: \u201cThe purest perfect shape of nature is the egg\u201d. The egg shape is also a significant feature of Bugatti\u2019s horseshoe grille, which was designed by Ettore in honor of his father\u2019s love of flowing curved shapes.\n\nAsprey Bugatti Egg Collection is backed by Bitcoin NFTs\n\nBugatti and Asprey have collaborated on a limited-edition collection of precious metal objet eggs \u2013 Asprey Bugatti Egg Collection. The Royale Edition of the Asprey Bugatti Egg Collection is produced using cutting-edge production techniques and materials from Asprey Studio, and is backed by Bitcoin NFTs.\n\nThe collection will be produced as both physical objects and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) generative artwork, with digital content inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain to ensure the artwork will last indefinitely. The collection is the first ever to be created by two luxury brands using this technique.\n\nThe egg collection coincides with the opening of Asprey Studio Gallery in Mayfair in April 2023.\n\nBitcoin NFTs are quickly becoming popular\n\nBitcoin NFTs are quickly becoming a popular choice among creators and collectors of digital collectibles. In a world where digital assets are becoming increasingly important, Bitcoin NFTs offer a new level of authenticity and ownership to the world of digital collectibles. Unlike traditional collectibles, which can be easily duplicated or forged, Bitcoin NFTs are uniquely identified and verified on the blockchain, providing an added layer of security.\n\nFurthermore, the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s robust infrastructure allows for scalability, meaning that it can handle an increasing number of NFT transactions without sacrificing speed or reliability. This is crucial for creators and collectors of NFTs who want to ensure that their assets are protected and easily transferable.\n\nOverall, Bitcoin NFTs are a promising addition to the world of digital collectibles, offering unparalleled security, stability, and scalability. As the popularity of digital assets continues to grow, Bitcoin NFTs will likely play an increasingly important role in the future of collectibles.\n\nYuga Labs has made a splash in the world of Bitcoin NFTs with the successful auction of its debut Bitcoin NFT collection, TwelveFold. The limited series proved to be a hot commodity, with 288 eager bidders snatching up pieces and spending a whopping $16.5 million worth of Bitcoin. The huge success of this auction is a testament to the growing popularity of Bitcoin NFTs as a valuable and unique asset class.\n\nThe Bitcoin NFT market is poised to experience tremendous growth in the coming years, with a forecasted value of $4.5 billion by 2025, according to a report by Galaxy Research. As the popularity of Bitcoin NFTs continues to grow, the report also predicts that a full ecosystem of supporting products and services will emerge by the first half of 2023.\n\nRead Also: How Luxury Brands Are Leveraging NFTs And Metaverse?"

        "title": "The Bitcoin Masterclasses Slovenia: The structure of distributed systems and searching for information - CoinGeek",
        "content": "width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nIn the third session of the second day of The Bitcoin Masterclasses in Slovenia, Dr. Wright delved deeper into the structure of distributed systems and addressed how we might link, index, and search for information on them.\n\nHow should distributed systems look?\n\nDr. Wright begins with a demonstration of how BTC works today. He shows how nodes do not transact in a truly peer-to-peer way but rather send information to ISPs that relay it on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a mesh network with multiple connections, but we can still do that,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat if one of our links goes down? We lose our connection. That\u2019s why we might want to have multiple links. Dr. Wright says the more links we have, the more it will cost, but the better the overall resilience will be.\n\n\u201cAs Bitcoin itself is distributed, your individual node can also be distributed,\u201d he says.\n\nLooking back to an earlier lecture, Dr. Wright reminded the attendees that we discussed applications in different locations, such as data centers and cities. This makes them far more resilient.\n\nAs well as the physical location of nodes and the infrastructure they run on, we must also think about how they connect to and communicate with each other, Dr. Wright says, adding to his diagram. In a three-node setup, we can use multicast, ensuring the information the main node broadcasts go to the other two.\n\nAs Dr. Wright said in his first Masterclass series in London, with User Datagram Protocol (UDP), if the information doesn\u2019t reach the other nodes, then it just doesn\u2019t reach it, and any detection of information being missed will have to be at the application level. However, with Reliable Data Protocol (RDP), the packets will be retransmitted (including by anycast) until the other nodes receive them. We have to think of all this when designing the systems that will act as part of a corporate network or as part of applications.\n\n\u201cIf we start thinking about a decentralized distributed system, it\u2019s not about avoiding legal responsibility [like the crypto bros]; it\u2019s about making something that will keep working, even allowing disaster zones to continue operating,\u201d Dr. Wright tells us. The most important thing to think about is how to structure them.\n\nLinking, finding, and searching for information\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, Dr. Wright says all of this could be the birth of a new type of data center. Perhaps Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) won\u2019t run everything in the future.\n\nWhen building applications and sorting information, we need to be able to find it, link it, etc. \u201cWhy do you think Google searches for information? What is it that Google is providing?\u201d Dr. Wright asks. It\u2019s an index.\n\nWhen we have these multicast groups we\u2019ve been speaking about, we will need to find ways of linking information between the groups so people know it\u2019s there. The groups will also have to have ways of responding and allowing people to join them. While we may have some traditional approaches, databases of databases are the likely outcome, Dr. Wright tells us. We\u2019ll have to leave behind the notion of there being \u201cone big Google out there.\u201d\n\nWhen we\u2019re talking about accessing all of this, that\u2019s where payments come in. Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) doesn\u2019t do what it does out of altruism; it\u2019s all about profit. Likewise, any alternative will be driven by the same profit incentive.\n\nDespite being the biggest search engine, Google isn\u2019t very good, and as a result, we have a \u201cterrible internet,\u201d according to Dr. Wright. He outlines how we could have searches that bring up only what we\u2019re looking for, such as the name of a band and its music, since the band will have paid to host their music on a node and will receive micropayments when it\u2019s played.\n\nWatch: Bitcoin Masterclass 2 with Craig Wright on Multicast & IP2IP\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

        "title": "Litecoin vs Bitcoin: Key Differences - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "In this article, we will explore the key differences between Litecoin and Bitcoin\n\nLitecoin and Bitcoin are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. While both are based on the same technology and share many similarities, there are several key differences between the two that set them apart. In this article, we will explore the key differences between Litecoin and Bitcoin.\n\nMining Algorithm- One of the key differences between Litecoin and Bitcoin is the mining algorithm used. Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm known as SHA-256, while Litecoin uses a PoW algorithm known as Scrypt. The Scrypt algorithm is considered to be more memory-intensive than SHA-256, making it more difficult to mine using specialized hardware known as ASICs. As a result, Litecoin can be mined using consumer-grade hardware, whereas Bitcoin mining requires specialized and expensive hardware. Transaction Speed- Another key difference between Litecoin and Bitcoin is the transaction speed. Litecoin has a faster block time than Bitcoin, which means that transactions can be confirmed faster. Litecoin has a block time of 2.5 mins, while Bitcoin has a block time of 10 mins. This means that Litecoin can handle more transactions per second than Bitcoin. Total Supply- Litecoin has a total supply of 84 million coins, while Bitcoin has a total supply of 21 million coins. This means that Litecoin will have four times as many coins in circulation as Bitcoin. However, both cryptocurrencies have a limited supply, which is one of the key reasons why they are considered to be valuable. Market Capitalization- Bitcoin has a much larger market capitalization than Litecoin. As of April 2023, the market capitalization of Bitcoin is over $1 trillion, while the market capitalization of Litecoin is around $10 billion. This means that Bitcoin is much more widely adopted and recognized than Litecoin. Adoption- Bitcoin has been adopted by more merchants and businesses than Litecoin. As a result, it is easier to buy and sell goods and services using Bitcoin. However, Litecoin has also been adopted by a growing number of merchants and businesses, and its adoption is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. Purpose- While both Litecoin and Bitcoin are cryptocurrencies, they have slightly different purposes. Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized digital currency that could be used to send and receive payments without the need for intermediaries such as banks. Litecoin, on the other hand, was designed to be a faster and cheaper alternative to Bitcoin, with a focus on enabling fast and low-cost payments. Community- Finally, the communities around Litecoin and Bitcoin are different. While both communities are passionate about their respective cryptocurrencies, the Bitcoin community tends to be larger and more active. This is partly because Bitcoin has been around longer and has a larger user base.\n\nIn conclusion, while Litecoin and Bitcoin share many similarities, there are several key differences between the two. Litecoin is designed to be a faster and cheaper alternative to Bitcoin, with a different mining algorithm, faster block times, and a larger total supply. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is more widely adopted and recognized, with a larger market capitalization and a focus on enabling decentralized payments. Ultimately, the choice between Litecoin and Bitcoin will depend on your individual needs and preferences.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Set Its Highest Weekly Close in 10 Months, Can BTC Breach $30K? - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin set the highest weekly close since June after closing the day at $28,283 on April 2. The big crypto was stable over the weekend after closing out March near $28,500, the highest in 10 months.\n\nBitcoin Price Weekly Chart\n\nBitcoin price was, however, flashing red on Monday, exchanging hands at $27,795. This was a 2.67% drop in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. A key resistance level is at the $28,500 mark. This is a historically significant barrier that is also playing out in the current halving cycle.\n\nNote that Bitcoin has been consolidating below this level for the last 10 months. Traders expected that a strong weekly close would cement the recent gains made by the flagship cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, the April 2 close fell short of the $28,750 that many had anticipated.\n\nHowever, the technical setup reveals that Bitcoin is still bullish.\n\nBitcoin Price Need To Reclaim $28,500 To Sustain The Uptrend\n\nBTC trades in a third straight bearish session on Monday as seen on the daily chart below. Apart from the 4.75% pullback being experienced at the moment from Thursday\u2019s high above $29,000 to the current price, the Layer 1 token has sustained a bullish outlook since March 9.\n\nFrom the chart below, BTC is trading below its weekly close of $28,283, the ascending but accelerated trendline, and the previous stubborn resistance at around $28,500, highlighted by the upper orange band.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is facing down and has sent a call to sell Bitcoin as seen on the same daily chart. This occurred on April 1 when the 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) \u2013 the blue line \u2013 crossed below the 26-day EMA \u2013 the orange line. This suggested that Bitcoin may continue correcting in the near term.\n\nAs such, a break below the lower orange band at $27,000 would spell doom for the largest crypto by market capitalization, with the first line of defense emerging from the $26,000 psychological level or the 50-day simple moving average around $24,900.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nConversely, the technical setup shows that Bitcoin is largely bullish. Note that the price sits above all the major moving averages, starting with the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) (the line in yellow), the 100-day SMA (the line in red), and the 200-day SMA (the line in purple), which is a bullish signal.\n\nBuyers are facing the toughest challenge at the moment, breaking the seller congestion level at $28,500, would likely pave the way for an upswing to $30,000. To do so, they must start by upholding support at $27,000 to avoid any chances of a pullback as described above.\n\nA break and hold above $30,000 is crucial for the continuation of the uptrend, and bulls must capitalize on the momentum created by the pioneer cryptocurrency since the beginning of the year to possibly bring $35,000 into the picture.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin literally \"to the moon\" - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "\u201cTo the moon\u201d is one of the slogans popular with those who believe that in the future the market value of Bitcoin may explode and skyrocket.\n\nBut there is one initiative in which \u201cto the moon\u201d referred to Bitcoin takes on a whole other, literal meaning instead.\n\nBitcoin \u201cto the moon\u201d: what happens?\n\nIt is an initiative of LunarCrush, i.e., a company that analyzes data and information about cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and social media actions.\n\nAs the official press release published a few days ago reveals, LunarCrush wants to send a 62 Bitcoin \u201ctreasure chest\u201d to Earth\u2019s natural satellite, namely the Moon.\n\nRight now 62 BTC have a market value of about $1.7 million.\n\nThe \u201ctreasure chest,\u201d named Nakamoto_1, will be opened by the first space traveler to reach the Moon and retrieve the private wallet key engraved on a Lunar Outpost MAPP Rover that will be launched into space by the end of 2023 by a SpaceX rocket. For security reasons, the exact launch date has not yet been revealed.\n\nOnce the Lunar Outpost MAPP Rover lands on the Moon, anyone can go to it to read the private key engraved on it, and thus unlock the 62 Bitcoin \u201ctreasure chest.\u201d\n\nThis initiative has been made possible through a partnership with Lunar Outpost, which will physically take care of sending the rover to the Moon.\n\nLunar Outpost is a company founded in 2017 that focuses on commercial space robotics, lunar surface mobility, and in-situ resource utilization. Lunar Outpost\u2019s flagship rover is indeed MAPP (Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform), which is expected to be the first commercial rover to reach the lunar South Pole.\n\nThe initiative also involves collaboration with animation studio Golden Wolf and Bitcoin developer tools company Hiro, which partnered with LunarCrush to bring Nakamoto_1 to life.\n\nThe mission will be funded through the sale of a specially created collection of NFTs.\n\nThe process of engraving the private key on the rover will be fully documented, so it will be transparent and ensure that no one, including the teams working on the project, will be able to acquire it prematurely.\n\nThe NFT collection\n\nTo fund the entire initiative, LunarCrush will sell a special collection of NFTs secured by Bitcoin: 25% of the sales will go to fund the treasure chest and another 25% will go into a \u201ccommunity marketing wallet that will go to fund grassroots development on Bitcoin.\n\nNFTs will be priced at $250 each. Any sales of these NFTs on the Gamma secondary market will further increase the value of the treasure chest sent to the Moon.\n\nAs is evident, this is an advertising initiative, and indeed those who will benefit the most will be the astronaut who can read on the lunar rover the private key to the address on which the 62 BTC will be deposited.\n\nGolden Wolf CEO Ingi Erlingsson said:\n\nComments on the initiative\n\n\u201cWe loved the idea that the art could inspire a new generation of young people to look to the stars, like a contemporary version of an Apollo 11 poster on a bedroom wall. We wanted the aesthetic to feel modern and unique, with a hint of vintage sci-fi art.\u201d\n\nLunarCrush CEO Joe Vezzani said:\n\n\u201cWhen you put out a seemingly unachievable goal, the innovation that happens can be incredible. Our goal is to inspire people to build communities that will unlock a new era of exploration. We envision classrooms, groups, companies, and even DAOs coming together to reach the Moon and split the treasure chest\u2019s rewards. It\u2019s like Willy Wonka\u2019s \u2018golden ticket\u2019 for the Web3 era, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited to see how it all unfolds.\u201d\n\nLunar Outpost co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer Dr. Forrest Meyen added:"

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) correlation with gold reached a multi-year high last week and is presently above 50%, exceeding its correlation with U.S. stocks.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin has withstood the current instability in the financial industry and mounting regulatory uncertainty very well, skyrocketing by over 70% YTD, greatly surpassing traditional asset classes as they see \u2018digital gold\u2019 as a potential store of value.\n\nTogether with on-chain statistics indicating a growing percentage of Bitcoin long-term investors, this may suggest that Bitcoin\u2019s appeal as a haven asset is on the ascent, according to data from Kaiko published on April 3.\n\nGold climbs 8% since March bank crisis began\n\nNotably, both the flagship digital asset and the precious metal suffered significant declines last year. However, gold has also seen a price increase of 8.6% since the collapse of Silvergate on March 8 brought about the banking crisis, bringing the price closer to its all-time high of $2,000, which was obtained shortly after the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWith Kaiko noting back in October:\n\n\u201cAfter benefiting heavily from the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the first quarter of the year, gold has lost all its gains and is currently down 10% YTD. Bitcoin has also declined double-digits this year dragged down by global monetary policy tightening.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, \u201cgold has failed to act as a safe-haven asset i.e., an asset that is expected to retain or gain in value during periods of economic downturn,\u201d in spite of \u201ccore inflation remaining persistently high.\u201d\n\nBitcoin and tech stocks\n\nMeanwhile, huge macro investors have already decreased their risk for the most part, which might explain the weakening connection with tech stocks.\n\nWhile the Nasdaq 100 has officially entered a bull market (up 20% or more from its December lows), volatility has decreased. After FTX\u2019s collapse, the disparity between crypto and U.S. stock market volatility has become wider and wider.\n\nAs market depth has been low for more than a month, increased BTC volatility may be attributed in part to a lack of liquidity. Since Binance, the biggest and most liquid exchange, faces regulatory restrictions that might increase risk aversion among market makers, this situation is not likely to change.\n\nKiyosaki says to buy Bitcoin and Gold\n\nAmid concerns over the potential economic collapse Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the best-selling personal finance book \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad,\u201d has warned about the state of the global economy, citing the United States Federal Reserve decisions as the catalyst for an imminent market crash.\n\nKiyosaki believes alternatives exist to cushion investors against the effects of a possible economic crash, highlighting Bitcoin and precious metals, such as gold and silver, are valuable assets to protect against mounting inflationary pressures.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin Office in El Salvador is born: all taxes on technological innovation in the country removed - The Cryptonomist",
        "content": "El Salvador, a well-known Bitcoin-friendly country, has just announced that all taxation related to technological innovations such as software programming, coding, app and artificial intelligence development, and computer hardware manufacturing will be removed.\n\nWill this be the prerequisite for El Salvador\u2019s growth and prosperity?\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at all the details of this together.\n\nNo tax in El Salvador to technologically innovate the country\n\nEl Salvador was the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nIt is now on the verge of accelerating the country\u2019s economic and technological growth by removing all taxation on software programming, code and app development, as well as hardware manufacturing.\n\nThis is a real turning point for the country: the introduction of Bitcoin as currency on 7 September 2021 was just the first move by President Nayib Bukele, who wants to harness new technologies to combat hyperinflation and poverty in the country.\n\nIndeed, it is well known that Bukele planned to leverage possible future capital gains from the purchase and sale of Bitcoin to modernize El Salvador.\n\nAs was promised by the president himself last week, he would send a bill to Congress proposing to abolish all taxes on income, property, and capital gains from technology-related activities.\n\nThe promise was kept: on 31 March Bukele tweeted the following:\n\nWhat will happen now? Will there be a successful transition of the country to a situation of economic prosperity?\n\nAt the moment, it is not possible to predict what the consequences will be on the economic front for El Salvador.\n\nCertainly these tax incentives will help the country\u2019s internal development and will also ensure opportunities for adjacent populations, who may decide to start businesses inherent in software, hardware and AI development while enjoying the tax breaks just described.\n\nIn addition, countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua may decide to follow in El Salvador\u2019s footsteps, effectively pushing the adoption of the cryptocurrency world throughout Central America.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you think that people from more prosperous countries such as the US, Canada, Germany, China, and Australia will move to El Salvador to start technology-based businesses, you are going about it the wrong way.\n\nIt is worth remembering that El Salvador is one of the most dangerous countries in the world: in 2022 the homicide rate was 12.6 inhabitants per 100,000.\n\nTo give you an idea, in Italy 0.6 homicides occur per 100 thousand inhabitants. This is about 20 times the rate.\n\nConsider that President Nayib Bukele only yesterday tweeted proudly saying that in April there were no murders for two days in a row.\n\nNo tweets today, hence there probably has been at least one murder: do your own thinking.\n\nSegundo d\u00eda de abril con 0 homicidios. Como se puede ver en la gr\u00e1fica, abril 2023 ya se compara con abril 2022, mes en el que ya estaba funcionando el R\u00e9gimen de de Excepci\u00f3n. https://t.co/BkzgkyssA2 \u2014 Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) April 3, 2023\n\nBitcoin office is born in El Salvador\n\nAccompanying the news of zero taxes on technology activities in the country is the announcement of the establishment of the \u201cBitcoin Association of El Salvador\u201d also known as the Bitcoin Office.\n\nThis body will be in charge of regulating initiatives among pro-Bitcoin entrepreneurs and companies.\n\nThe stated goal of the association is to \u201cposition the country in the world as a technological and economic powerhouse.\u201d\n\nBukele is trying hard to grow El Salvador using Bitcoin.\n\nEarlier this year he passed a bill that will allow the issuance of bonds backed by Bitcoin. This will be a somewhat risky financial product, but quite interesting to watch.\n\nThe president\u2019s attempts are not only about the country\u2019s technological financial environment but include activities to promote tourism, fight terrorism, and create regional economic entities.\n\nAyer tuvimos una reuni\u00f3n muy especial con la @bitcoinofficesv Las empresas de #Bitcoin y los reguladores llevan iniciativas conjuntas para aportar a\u00fan m\u00e1s a #ElSalvador Como miembro de @asobitcoin recibir\u00e1s este y muchos m\u00e1s beneficios exclusivos! pic.twitter.com/OFgzpO4GA6 \u2014 Asociaci\u00f3n Bitcoin de El Salvador (@asobitcoin) March 30, 2023\n\nEl Salvador: how the investment in Bitcoin is going\n\nHow is El Salvador\u2019s famous investment in Bitcoin doing?\n\nIn September 2021, in addition to declaring the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization legal tender, Nayib Bukele bought several Bitcoin on several occasions to make up for the country\u2019s poverty and decay.\n\nAccording to the available data, El Salvador currently holds 2,381 BTC, bought at an average price of $43,357: this is an expense of about $100 million.\n\nAs of today, considering that the price per Bitcoin is $28,140, the value of the investment is around $67 million.\n\nThis is a total unrealized loss of $33 million.\n\nAssuming that the Bitcoin have not yet been sold, hence the current value might change in time, we can still say that Bukele does not really represent a trader to be taken as an example.\n\nThe same thing can be said about the famous Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, a public company with the largest number of BTC on its balance sheet, namely 138,955.\n\nFor Saylor, the unrealized loss is around $240 million, well above El Salvador\u2019s loss.\n\nHowever, in this case the average purchase price for MicroStrategy is $29.817"

        "content": "A company called LunarCrush will be sending bitcoin to the Moon by engraving a passcode to a crypto wallet on its rover.\n\nBy Kevin C. Neece |\n\nA company called LunarCrush will be sending bitcoin to the Moon by engraving a passcode to a crypto wallet on its rover, set to launch to the lunar south pole. Gizmodo reports that later this year, a SpaceX rocket will carry the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform, aka MAPP Lunar Rover rover to the Moon, landing it there for a thankfully more scientific purpose than drawing cryptocurrency pirates into literal orbit: bringing the Internet to the lunar surface. The plan for the mission is to test mobile communications signals on the Moon\u2019s surface, as part of a bid to establish the first 4G network in space.\n\nThe rocket bringing bitcoin to the Moon was designed by Lunar Outpost, which has been making physical payload space and sponsorship opportunities available on its lunar lander for some time, and has also been attempting to commoditize space by selling NFTs. While this scheme might be a way to help fund the mission at present, crypto values vary wildly, so the 62 bitcoin in the wallet, currently stated to be worth $1.5 million, could tank in value or\u2014ahem\u2014skyrocket by the time of the launch, let alone by some future date when someone can get to the Moon to retrieve the passcode. For that presently incredibly fanciful goal to be cost-effective, of course, bitcoin would have to become basically the most valuable investment in existence.\n\nAs Gizmodo reports, Joe Vezzanni, CEO of LunarCrush, said the bitcoin launch to the Moon was planned as a way to encourage innovation in space travel by creating an \u201cunachievable goal.\u201d We think the real unachievable goal might be rescuing cryptocurrencies from their association with environmental irresponsibility, unpredictable instability, and financial crime, but any effort toward the advancement of space travel is a good thing, right? LunarCrush certainly hopes so as it works to bring wi-fi to our nearest neighbor in our solar system.\n\nThat might sound nearly as useless as putting bitcoin on the Moon at first blush, but it serves an important scientific purpose. As NASA continues its push to the Moon begun by the unmanned Artemis I a few months ago, it wants to improve communication on the lunar surface and between astronauts and mission control, with the 4G network allowing live video streams and real-time communication with Earth. This would be a leap forward in NASA\u2019s ability to communicate with its scientific exploration teams once human beings are again setting foot on the Moon.\n\nPutting bitcoin on the Moon might be a lesser goal, but we have to admit it\u2019s got us thinking and talking about the very real scientific and exploratory purposes of lunar missions. The Moon has lots to share with us, from strange glass beads that might contain water to the possibility of growing plants to, as Star Trek predicted, a place to live. We think all the research, exploration, and technological advancement involved in reaching the Moon is a lot more interesting and important than advancing crypto piracy to ridiculous levels, but if putting bitcoin on the Moon can in any way help scientific efforts, we say go right ahead."
