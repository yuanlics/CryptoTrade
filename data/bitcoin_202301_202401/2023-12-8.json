        "content": "It should be no surprise that Bitcoin sold for over $44,000 this week, more than double its March 13 price. Going back to 2014, it has taken the cryptocurrency an average of nine months and 21 days to double; the milestone came 28 days early this time.\n\nWhat is mildly surprising is that Bitcoin doubled without ever falling below its March 13 low. On average, it has dropped 27% between doublings (that is, if it starts from $1,000, it drops to $730 before trading above $2,000) and it has dropped as much as 83% (trading for $170 before going to $2,000)."

        "content": "Print this page\n\nBitcoin is booming again, just weeks after the downfall of two of the industry\u2019s biggest names. Bulls are hoping the prosecutions draw a line under the sector\u2019s troubled past and will allow it to tap billions of dollars of cash from Wall Street.\n\nThe price of the most actively traded cryptocurrency has soared about 160 per cent this year to a 20-month high of $44,000, leading the charge among digital tokens as the gloomy sentiment that has hung over the market fades and traders pile back in.\n\nIt comes only weeks after the US successfully secured criminal prosecutions against Changpeng Zhao and Sam Bankman-Fried, the former chiefs of the Binance and FTX exchanges respectively and two of the biggest names associated with the bubble market of 2020-21.\n\nSpeculators are now betting that the toughest regulatory punishments have passed and bitcoin will be embraced by large global fund managers and investment banks.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at the two biggest guys in crypto potentially both going to jail and yet crypto goes on . . the old guard is being replaced by fresh money,\u201d said Ed Hindi, chief investment officer at investment management firm Tyr Capital.\n\n\u201cEverything has been thrown at bitcoin and it\u2019s held up, whether you like it or not, it\u2019s going to command a place in portfolios.\u201d\n\nThe surge in bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, comes as investors place bets on growth stocks and riskier assets in anticipation that central banks will begin cutting interest rates next year.\n\nCK Zheng, co-founder and chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund ZX Squared Capital, said Fed rate cuts were just \u201cthe icing on the cake\u201d. \u201cThe fundamentals of the bitcoin price are driven by the introduction of highly regulated companies into the market. Wall Street is coming to adopt crypto,\u201d he added.\n\nThe crypto market, known for its booms and busts, has a particular spring in its step after 20 months of negative headlines and painful declines. From a peak of just over $69,000 in November 2021, bitcoin had slumped in value by three quarters to just $16,000 at the start of this year.\n\nIts steady recovery this year gained momentum in November, particularly after US authorities fined Binance $4.3bn for breaching money laundering and financial sanctions. Crucially, it did not shut down the world\u2019s most influential crypto exchange.\n\nThat decision has helped draw out the crypto bulls. This week El Salvador\u2019s authoritarian president Nayib Bukele, under whom bitcoin became legal tender in 2021, triumphantly posted on social media site X that the country\u2019s holdings of the digital currency were back in profit. Meanwhile, Brian Armstrong, chief executive of US exchange Coinbase, said he had been contemplating how bitcoin \u201cmay be the key to extending western civilisation\u201d.\n\nSome even see the beginning of a new supercycle. Bernstein, the US investment bank, last month predicted bitcoin could more than treble in value to $150,000 by 2025.\n\nKey to the optimism is approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission for exchange traded funds that invest directly in the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe market has long viewed a spot bitcoin ETF as a way to tap US retail investors, with a cheap but safe and regulated investment product. For a decade the SEC has resisted all applications, arguing bitcoin prices are set on unregulated exchanges and so it cannot give adequate investor protections.\n\nBut pressure has been growing on the SEC since it lost a court ruling last summer on its reasons for blocking an ETF application by asset management firm Grayscale. BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are among the well-known names that have filed applications, raising hopes they can bring vast numbers of US retail investors to crypto. A decision from the SEC could come as soon as next month.\n\n\u201cJust improving market access shouldn\u2019t really buoy prices, but I think it does because it\u2019s an explicit nod from the SEC that they approve of bitcoin, at least in some respects,\u201d said James Butterfill, head of research at investment group CoinShares.\n\nMany investors have already bought cryptocurrencies in anticipation that demand will continue to grow. According to data from CoinShares, there have been 10 consecutive weeks of inflows into digital assets products, a wave of investment that came shortly after Grayscale\u2019s court victory over the SEC.\n\nSpeculators hope US regulators\u2019 acceptance of bitcoin ETFs will provide more durable support to prices, in contrast to previous bitcoin rallies, such as 2013, 2017 and 2021, when prices surged quickly only to collapse just as violently.\n\n\u201cThis will be the first time there could be true recognition of bitcoin . . . I do think this signifies that, this time, the rally will be more sustained,\u201d Butterfill added.\n\nOptimists also point to a technical change in the production of bitcoin that, they argue, will sustain demand. In April next year the number of bitcoin that miners receive for verifying cryptocurrency transactions will halve, with the aim of reducing the supply of fresh bitcoins on the market.\n\n\u201cThis will be a very strong technical driver for the price of bitcoin as mining becomes more difficult and less profitable, and scarcity continues to increase,\u201d said Tim Frost, chief executive of Yield App, a crypto platform that offers customers yields on digital assets.\n\nIn spite of the renewed confidence, some doubts linger over the durability of bitcoin\u2019s rally. Two of the US\u2019s largest ETF providers, Vanguard and State Street, have not filed to list a spot bitcoin ETF. State Street told Financial News in the summer that \u201cthere was no investment case for crypto\u201d.\n\nUS authorities have said that scrutiny on illicit behaviour in sub-sectors such as the stablecoin market will continue next year.\n\nThe SEC has outstanding cases against Binance and US-listed Coinbase, alleging both marketplaces were unregistered exchanges and sold unregistered securities. Victories for the SEC could force many of them to register with the regulator and impose tougher surveillance and transparency on their markets.\n\nSome industry insiders also doubt that the SEC will break the habit of a lifetime and approve a bitcoin spot ETF.\n\nDavid Mercer, chief executive of LMAX Group, a currency trading venue, said that SEC approval of an ETF was already priced into the market but added that the bigger goal was turning traditional assets such as securities into digital tokens.\n\n\u201cThe end game is most of traditional finance being enabled by blockchain in the decades to come, so from that perspective, we\u2019re just at the start,\u201d he added.\n\nBut after months of negative headlines and a barrage of enforcement actions, some hope the rally can merely mark a break from the past, rather than kick-starting another bull run.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on breaking out of this orbit we\u2019ve been locked in the last 18 months rather than some astronomical price spike,\u201d said Michael Safai, co-founder of trading firm Dexterity Capital. \u201cThose days are over, or they should be,\u201d Safai added."

        "content": "Since its inception, Bitcoin (BTC) has been the leading light in the world of cryptocurrency. It has dominated the markets and has been the market-leading cryptocurrency by a country mile. However, since reaching the $60,000 price mark in 2021, it was on a freefall till it hit rock bottom at $20,000. The good news is it is making rapid strides again and breached the $44,000 mark on Tuesday, Dec 5.\n\nThis optimism about BTC has been centered around many top investment firms from the traditional marketplace starting to file for U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) approval of their Bitcoin ETFs. Investors are currently anticipating a spot Bitcoin ETF approval by the SEC as early as the first half of 2024. Many believe this could pave the way for a surge in institutional investment in the crypto sector.\n\nThe focus has also shifted to what the Fed's monetary policy will be in 2024. Currently, it is highly anticipated that the Fed will hold the interest rates at their current level in its Dec 13 meeting and start bringing it down sometime in first-quarter 2024. With interest rates coming down and investors getting more speculative, riskier asset classes like cryptocurrencies are well-positioned to benefit. In addition, the scheduled Bitcoin \u201chalving\u201d in April 2024 will slash the number of mined Bitcoins in what is expected to be a booming market for the benchmark crypto coin, thereby raising its price even further.\n\nAs of date, the price of the crypto behemoth has risen more than 150% in 2023 and constitutes 51.3% of the entire crypto market. Currently, it is on a steady march to cross the $50,000 level, and because of the factors mentioned above, it is expected to get further traction. In such an environment, it might be prudent to track stocks that are exposed to or directly linked to Bitcoin. Here are our choices.\n\nCboe Global Markets, Inc.

        "content": "2022 Price Changes 2023 Price Changes 2022 Volume Changes 2023 Volume Changes Sunday -0.27% 0.53% 3.86% 12.21% Monday 0.02% 0.12% 47.65% 59.56% Tuesday -0.06% 0.97% 3.69% 2.75% Wednesday -0.27% 0.06% 2.93% 11.49% Thursday -0.20% -0.37% -0.42% 0.67% Friday -0.64% 0.48% 7.34% 1.72% Saturday -0.21% 0.13% -31.11% -36.60%\n\nBitcoin's average price changes (by midnight) in 2022 tended to drop from the previous midnight, but you'll notice that Friday night's change was the most significant drop, while Mondays was the most significant increase.\n\nIt should also be remembered that 2022 was often called a \"crypto winter\" as prices continued dropping through the year, somewhat mirroring the stock market, influenced by downward market pressures. Bitcoin's prices tend to follow stock market trends but are much more exaggerated in the short term.\n\nDuring 2023, all but Thursday's average price changes were positive by midnight. Average volume changes for both years demonstrate that volumes tended to drop on weekends as professional traders stopped trading. On Sundays, some traders were active, increasing volume from the night before. Mondays suggest professional traders got back to work as average trading volumes rose significantly and continued to rise throughout the work week.\n\nInterpreting the Price and Volume Data\n\nIt's difficult to discern if volume changes occur for reasons other than the days of the week professional traders are working, but it's a good bet that traders of all kinds are taking some time off during the weekend.\n\nIt also appears that bitcoin's market price doesn't change much (percentage-wise) regardless of the changes in trading volume\u2014but given the price of one bitcoin, even a price change of 0.5% could be a few hundred dollars.\n\nSo, what does all this mean for weekend traders? Less volume usually means lower liquidity and fewer opportunities in a market already touted as less liquid than other markets. But there are opportunities to make large profits on the weekends trading bitcoin.\n\nThe image below shows prices on Saturday, Dec. 9, 2023, in one-minute increments. On this particular Saturday, there were some opportunities for large profits from increases but also some significant drops that could cause massive losses. Between 8:30 and 9:10, the price dropped from about $44,200 to $43,760\u2014about $440 in less than 40 minutes. Several hours later, it nearly recovered, then dropped again by a few hundred dollars.\n\nTradingView\n\nA trader who can take advantage of movements like these could walk away with a significant profit, but the chances of losing a large amount are just as high.\n\n\n\nIs It Good To Trade Bitcoin on the Weekends? Bitcoin prices are as volatile on the weekend as during regular trading hours, but there is much less volume. Trading Bitcoin is always risky, but weekend trading adds more risk. If you can tolerate the risk and stick to your strategy, you could still trade profitably on weekends.\n\nCan I Trade Bitcoin on the Weekends? Cryptocurrency markets are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so you can trade bitcoin on the weekend.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Go Up on the Weekends? There is no pattern of price climbs on weekends, but prices can rise and fall significantly within minutes.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCryptocurrency trading is an around-the-clock activity, giving you the flexibility to trade anytime. Weekends may be a good time to trade if you're busy throughout the week and don't have time to trade\u2014there are opportunities to profit.\n\nHowever, it is important to understand that trading volume was generally lower on weekends in 2022 and 2023 while prices continued rising and falling. Lower volume lessens liquidity in a market that is already somewhat low, and the cryptocurrency market can turn on a dime. But for the trader who can tolerate risks and stick with their strategy, Bitcoin weekend trading provides some excellent (but risky) opportunities.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "On Thursday, the government of El Salvador, alongside the stablecoin company Tether, announced a joint initiative called \u201cAdopting El Salvador Freedom\u201d that allows foreigners to obtain a Salvadoran passport in exchange for paying $1 million in Bitcoin.\n\nIn 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, mandating that businesses accept the leading cryptocurrency as a form of payment and rolling out a digital wallet called \u201cChivo,\u201d incentivizing citizens to partake with a $30 sign-up bonus in Bitcoin.\n\nThe venture proved controversial, with Salvadorans protesting the move\u2014alongside President Nayib Bukele\u2019s concerning autocratic shift\u2014and adoption was slow, with the vast majority of citizens sticking with cash. Meanwhile, Bukele\u2019s spending tens of millions in federal funds on Bitcoin proved disastrous, with its price plummeting from an all-time high of around $69,000 in November 2021\u2014when Bukele announced the development of a \u201cBitcoin City\u201d\u2014to under $17,000 at the beginning of 2023.\n\nStill, El Salvador has proved popular with Bitcoin acolytes from around the world, with the country\u2019s tourism minister announcing in May that travelers were flocking to the country in historic numbers, driven by its commitment to crypto. That included many of the international community\u2019s most prominent \u201cBitcoin maxis,\u201d such as the influential company Swan Bitcoin, which opened a house in El Zonte, a surf town largely credited for starting the country\u2019s Bitcoin experiment.\n\nA steep decrease in the nation\u2019s crime\u2014spurred by Bukele\u2019s contentious policy of locking up thousands of the country\u2019s alleged gang members\u2014has further incentivized Bitcoin supporters to flock to the country.\n\n\u2018Visionary individuals\u2019\n\nThursday\u2019s announcement represents a new phase for El Salvador\u2019s commitment to Bitcoin, buoyed by Bukele\u2019s unverified pronouncement that his investment in Bitcoin has turned profitable, thanks to a recent price rally.\n\nThe Bukele administration has long partnered with Bitfinex, an affiliated company of Tether\u2014the world\u2019s leading stablecoin, or a crypto asset pegged, in this case, to the U.S. dollar\u2014that has faced scrutiny over its lack of transparency and offshore jurisdiction. In April, Bitfinex became the first company to receive a license in El Salvador\u2019s new crypto regulatory regime, and the government tapped the firm to help launch a long-delayed Bitcoin-backed bond.\n\nAccording to a statement from Tether shared with Fortune, the new visa program enables participants to obtain a Salvadoran passport through a one-time payment of $1 million in Bitcoin, which the company is describing as an \u201cinvestment,\u201d although it is unclear where the funding will be directed. The program is seeking \u201cvisionary individuals,\u201d including \u201chigh-net-worth investors.\u201d\n\nTo start the process, applicants must pay a nonrefundable deposit of $999 in Bitcoin and Ether, followed by an unspecified \u201cknow your customer\u201d process. The statement includes a government link to an application page, with a banner that says \u201cPowered by Tether.\u201d\n\nThe program comes alongside concerns from Salvadorans that an influx of tourists, especially in coastal cities like El Zonte attracting the crypto crowd, is pushing out lower-income families. In late November, local publication Mala Yerba reported that 25 families were facing eviction in El Zonte for the construction of a public park called \u201cBitcoin Beach Club de Playa.\u201d"

        "content": "Considering the apparent lack of a fundamental value (Papsdorf et al. 2022), the exponential growth in the volume of transactions involving Bitcoin and in its price is certainly surprising. After an initial popularity among a small community of experts, the usage of Bitcoin has been subsequently driven by the black market of illegal goods and services and by gambling (Foley et al. 2019, Marmora 2021). More recently, however, the soaring popularity of cryptocurrency exchange markets and Bitcoin might have also been driven by speculative motives (Baur et al. 2018) or, possibly, by its potential use for cross-border transactions and transfers (Graf von Luckner et al. 2023, Makarov and Schoar 2021), although the high volatility of its price makes Bitcoin impractical as a medium of exchange (Baur and Dimpfl 2021). The popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has not been confined to few economies, but it has morphed into a global phenomenon, with emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) at the forefront of crypto adoption (Chainanalysis 2022).\n\nTo what extent is Bitcoin usage a global phenomenon driven by speculative demand? To what extent can country-specific factors explain the use of Bitcoin? These are important questions for policymakers, both to assess the potential risks from cryptoassets and to decide how to regulate the crypto ecosystem, that so far have received only partial answers (Makarov and Schoar, 2021, Kawashima et al. 2022), largely due to the difficulty to trace who owns and trades cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo answer these questions, in a recent study (Di Casola et al. 2023), we overcome the obstacle of limited country-by-country information on cryptocurrency analysing trading volumes of Bitcoin against the fiat currencies of 14 advanced economies (AEs) and the currencies of 30 EMDEs in the largest peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges (LocalBitcoins and Paxful), over the period January 2018 to April 2022.\n\nPeer-to-peer exchanges perform transactions outside the blockchain network (i.e. they are off-chain) in a decentralised manner, target mainly small retail users, and are usually not affected by the problem of market manipulation, such as wash trading, typical of centralised exchanges (Cong et al. 2023), thus making the transactions we analyse more reliable. Peer-to-peer exchanges have gained popularity in particular in emerging markets and developing economies, being more suitable for their currencies that do not have a large trading pool to be easily used in centralised crypto exchanges (Aramonte et al. 2022).\n\nA global crypto cycle driven by speculative motives\n\nIn our empirical analysis, we find that momentum and volatility in the crypto-asset market as well as global financial market volatility and liquidity do matter for Bitcoin trading against different fiat currencies, including those of advanced economies. However, our crypto-assets and global drivers fail to capture the full extent of co-movement in Bitcoin trading across currencies and over time. Indeed, our analysis identifies a single global factor that on average explains up to around 40% of the variance of Bitcoin trading across different currencies in the Covid-19 period. There is therefore suggestive evidence of a global crypto cycle in Bitcoin transactions, echoing the findings of the global financial cycle literature for traditional asset markets (Miranda-Agrippino and Rey 2022). This global factor, in turn, is correlated with the Bitcoin price, as shown in Figure 1. Trading across currencies and users around the world moves in tandem with fluctuations in the Bitcoin price, suggesting that Bitcoin is largely used as a speculative investment asset across advanced, emerging, and developing economies.\n\nFigure 1 A global factor in Bitcoin trading volumes against fiat currencies is correlated with the Bitcoin price\n\nNotes: The figure shows the first factor extracted from the trading volume of Bitcoin transactions against fiat currencies (blue line) and the change in the Bitcoin price (yellow line). Trading volumes and the Bitcoin price are detrended with the log difference with respect to the past 15-week moving average.\n\nIn emerging and developing economies, other factors do matter for Bitcoin trading\n\nBitcoin seems to offer also some transactional benefits, in particular in emerging markets and developing economies. The depreciation of the domestic currency of EMDEs \u2013 notably not of the currencies of advanced economies \u2013 induces more Bitcoin trading, in particular since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. This indeed suggests that Bitcoin, despite its wide price fluctuations, might have been appreciated also as a store of value or medium of exchange in countries which experienced a loss in the purchasing power of their domestic currency. In turn, this implies that macroeconomic instability may potentially spur greater cryptoasset usage. This result is important for the asset pricing theory of cryptoassets (Biais et al. 2023), suggesting that the fundamental value of Bitcoin may be substantially different between advanced economies and emerging and developing economies, since its transactional services are probably more elevated in the latter group of countries. Moreover, we find that proxies of banking depth and digitalisation are negatively correlated with the extent to which each currency loads on the global common factor in Bitcoin trading volumes, indicating that crypto-assets may offer a speculative alternative to traditional finance when this is not available, in particular in emerging and developing economies where the share of younger risk-prone population is higher.\n\nPolicy implications\n\nOur findings clearly point to potential financial stability risks in emerging and developing economies with low levels of financial development and unstable fiat currencies. The intrinsic price volatility of Bitcoin may discourage its use as a store of value or means of payment. However, in the future, other crypto-assets, such as stablecoins that pledge to ensure a parity to the US dollar or other reserve currencies, might become more widely used by individuals and firms in order to compensate for the lack of financial alternatives, raising the risk of cryptoisation, i.e. the substitution of the domestic currency with a cryptocurrency \u2013 representing a threat to the implementation of capital flow management policies in these countries (He et al. 2022).\n\nAuthors\u2019 note: The views expressed in this column belong to the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the European Central Bank.\n\nReferences\n\nAramonte, S, H Wenqian and A Schrimpf (2022), \u201cTracing the Footprint of Cryptoization in Emerging Market Economies\u201d, BIS Quarterly Review, March.\n\nAuer, R and D Tercero-Lucas (2021), \u201cDistrust versus speculation?

        "content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet approved an ETF that would hold bitcoin directly, though some expect that to soon change.\n\nThe regulator is set to rule on a proposal by Ark Invest and 21Shares \u2014 and potentially similar filings by a dozen others \u2014 by Jan. 10.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analysts have said they believe the chance of spot bitcoin ETF approval by that date is about 90% \u2014 an estimate former SEC executive John Reed Stark recently called \u201cabsolutely absurd.\u201d\n\nThe issuers hoping to launch these products range from the largest asset manager in the world, to smaller, more specialized firms. A Switzerland-based fund group threw its hat in the ring as recently as last week.\n\nA list compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s James Seyffart shows there are 13 proposed spot bitcoin ETFs currently in front of the SEC.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nLet\u2019s dive into each applicant and where their bids for a spot bitcoin ETF stand.\n\nGrayscale Investments\n\nGrayscale Investments\u2019 August court win over the SEC was one event that has catalyzed increased optimism around the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, according to industry watchers.\n\nJudges ruled at the time the regulator denying the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to an ETF \u2014 but allowing bitcoin futures-based ETFs to launch \u2014 was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The SEC opted not to challenge this ruling.\n\nGrayscale has said GBTC is ready to operate as an ETF upon regulatory approval, noting it would be \u201cworking collaboratively and expeditiously with the SEC.\u201d\n\nWhile the timeline for spot bitcoin ETF approval is \u201cinherently uncertain,\u201d Grayscale noted in a Dec. 1 blog post, the firm believes it is \u201ca matter of when, not a matter of if.\u201d\n\nIf Grayscale receives approval from the SEC, the company plans to immediately move GBTC from the OTCQX Market to NYSE Arca, Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm said in the post.\n\nThe simultaneous creations and redemptions \u2014 as a result of converting to an ETF \u2014 would essentially eliminate any discount or premium the shares have historically held and allow for the trust to more closely track BTC\u2019s value, the company has said.\n\nArk Invest, 21Shares\n\nThose watching the bitcoin ETF race have probably heard these firm names often. They first collaborated on a spot bitcoin fund proposal in 2021.\n\nThat application was blocked in March 2022, and the SEC denied a second attempt in January. But the companies\u2019 latest re-filing came in April, ahead of all subsequent applications by asset management giant BlackRock and others.\n\nThe SEC is expected to rule on the latest filing by Jan. 10, a date on which some segment observers believe the regulator will also decide the fate of similar proposals by other issuers.\n\n\u201cWe do think while we\u2019re first in line that a number of the firms will be approved at the same time,\u201d Ark CEO Cathie Wood said during a Wednesday webinar. \u201cDepending on exactly how they filed, it could be that more than a half dozen are approved in the first go.\u201d\n\nRead more: Spot bitcoin ETF would be \u2018final seal of approval\u2019 for institutions: Cathie Wood\n\nThe firms updated their bitcoin ETF application for a third time on Nov. 20, noting a sponsor fee of 0.80% of the trust\u2019s bitcoin holdings. The fund\u2019s shares would trade on the Cboe BZK Exchange with the ticker ARKB.\n\nBlackRock\n\nThey are the financial giant that manages $9 trillion or so in assets. The company\u2019s entrance into the spot bitcoin ETF race in June spurred many others to re-up their own bids for such a product.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s proposed iShares Bitcoin Trust would carry the ticker IBTC and trade on Nasdaq.\n\nThe company met several times with officials at the SEC\u2019s division of trading and markets last month. Its Nov. 20 meeting announcement included an outline of the difference between in-kind and cash redemption models.\n\nAuthorized participants for different ETFs engage in the creation and redemption of shares using two primary methods: in-kind or cash transactions.\n\nWith in-kind transactions, APs exchange ETF shares for a corresponding basket of securities that reflects the ETF\u2019s holdings. For in cash transactions, APs create or redeem shares in exchange for cash rather than securities.\n\nA document from Nov. 28 \u2014 a day in which another meeting took place \u2014 noted \u201cthe SEC has certain unresolved questions around the in-kind model.\u201d\n\nBlackRock\u2019s latest proposal amendment \u2014 filed on Monday \u2014 notes the trust would only accept in-kind creation and redemption requests from authorized participants and market makers that have implemented compliance programs.\n\nAmong other additions to the updated filing was the language around the firm raising $100,000 of seed capital for the fund.\n\nBitwise\n\nBitwise\u2019s latest S-1 amendment came the same day as BlackRock\u2019s. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF \u2014 formerly proposed to be named the Bitwise Bitcoin ETP Trust \u2014 would trade on the NYSE Arca under the ticker BITB.\n\n\u201cBoth the SEC and these issuers are working hard to iron things out,\u201d Seyffart said in a Monday X post. \u201cThese filings are likely the result of many conversations and a lot of man hours on/between both sides.\u201d\n\nBitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan has pointed to dialogue between issuers and the SEC as one reason \u201cit does feel different this time than it did a few months ago.\u201d\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETF saga reaches \u2018pattern break\u2019 as amendments pile up\n\nLike others, Bitwise has looked to launch a spot bitcoin ETF for several years.\n\nThe firm submitted a 100-plus page white paper in October 2021. This showed the CME bitcoin futures market led the spot market and unregulated bitcoin futures market. It published additional research demonstrating that a new bitcoin ETP is unlikely to predominantly influence CME bitcoin futures market prices.\n\nBitwise, in a September filing, addressed eight disagreements the SEC had with research included in the company\u2019s previous application.\n\nVanEck\n\nVanEck updated its S-1 form for its VanEck Bitcoin Trust Friday, marking its fifth amendment. The fund\u2019s ticker is set to be HODL, the disclosure notes.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nHODL would trade on Cboe. The latest disclosure does not disclose a fee for the proposed product.\n\nVanEck has named Gemini Trust Company as custodian of the ETF\u2019s bitcoin \u2014 a divergence from most others who are trusting Coinbase with that responsibility.\n\nMatthew Sigel, VanEck\u2019s head of digital assets research, said in June the SEC should approve all spot bitcoin ETFs at once.\n\nSigel and VanEck investment analyst Patrick Bush wrote Thursday they expect such products to be approved in the first quarter. They estimate inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs will amount to roughly $1 billion in the first few days and $2.4 billion within the first three months.\n\nWisdomTree\n\nWisdomTree re-filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in June in the wake of BlackRock\u2019s filing.\n\nThe firm, with roughly $98 billion in assets under management, said in the disclosure: \u201cthe bitcoin market has matured such that it is operating at a level of efficiency and scale similar in material respects to established global equity, fixed income and commodity markets.\u201d\n\n\n\nWisdomTree amended its bitcoin ETF application on Nov. 16. The fund\u2019s shares would trade on the Cboe BZK Exchange with the ticker BTCW.\n\n\u201cIt does seem like there\u2019s been some exciting momentum, [and] we remain very focused on a spot bitcoin ETF,\u201d Will Peck, WisdomTree\u2019s head of digital assets, said during the company\u2019s October earnings call. \u201cWe think it\u2019s the best execution for the asset class in the traditional channels in the US, and we\u2019re looking forward to continue engaging with regulators on it.\u201d\n\nInvesco\n\nInvesco also re-filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in June, following in BlackRock\u2019s footsteps. The proposed ETF would list on the Cboe BZX exchange. The application was filed in partnership with Galaxy Digital, mirroring a 2021 bitcoin ETF application the two filed.\n\nThe firm made amendments to its application earlier this fall, showing that it continues to have dialogue with the regulators as they continue to mull a decision.\n\nThe ticker would be BTCO, according to a listing on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation.\n\nFidelity\n\nFidelity joined the current spot bitcoin ETF race as a re-filer, similar to Invesco and Ark. One thing that makes the proposed bitcoin ETF stand out is its custodian: Fidelity Digital Assets Services. It would not, unlike some of its competitors, use Coinbase.\n\nFidelity Digital Assets has offered custodian and trade execution services since 2018, making it a clear option for the firm to custody in-house.\n\nThe proposal was first filed in late June, meaning it also followed BlackRock. Back in 2021, Fidelity filed for a spot bitcoin ETF, though it was blocked by the SEC in January of last year.\n\nThe fund would trade under the ticker FBTC, according to the DTCC listing. Like Invesco, it would list on Cboe.\n\nValkyrie\n\nValkyrie filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in late June, following \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 BlackRock. It did, however, beat Fidelity to the punch with its filing by a few days.\n\nThe firm has also filed multiple amendments to its proposal. Unlike some other applicants, Valkyrie seemed to have fun with its proposed ticker, BRRR \u2014 seemingly a reference to the sound of a money printer.\n\nThe ETF would be listed on Nasdaq alongside BlackRock\u2019s proposed ETF. The two are the only funds who went with the Nasdaq exchange. Coinbase is, unsurprisingly, listed as the proposed custodian for the fund.\n\nThe SEC last delayed the Valkyrie application at the end of September, and its next deadline comes after the golden window laid out by Seyffart.\n\nValkyrie Chief Investment Officer Steven McClurg, in an interview with Schwab Network, said he believes the price of bitcoin \u2014 with both the halving and potential spot bitcoin ETF launches \u2014 could go as high as $100,000 next year.\n\nGlobal X\n\nAnother re-filer. Global X filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in August after initially pursuing one in 2021.\n\nLike others, it plans to list on the Cboe exchange, with Coinbase as a custodian. The application originally filed with the SEC listed Coinbase as a surveillance-sharing partner, in a move seen to appease regulators.\n\nThe application was delayed back in November, with the SEC saying \u2014 to no one\u2019s surprise \u2014 that it needed more time to consider the application.\n\nPrior to its delay, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas posted on X that discussions between the SEC and possible spot bitcoin ETF issuers about adding in cash-creations to the proposed ETFs 19b-4 filings. The discussions, Balchunas said, is a \u201cgood sign.\u201d\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nHashdex\n\nHashdex filed its 19b-4 for its spot bitcoin ETF back in September, making it one of the later applicants.\n\nThe application, however, stands out from the rest because of its unique nature. Hashdex filed in late August to hold spot bitcoin in its bitcoin futures ETF. The application updated the name to the Hashdex Bitcoin ETF \u201cto reflect the Fund\u2019s updated investment strategy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of the few not relying on Coinbase as a surveillance sharing partner. It has instead opted to use CME\u2019s Market Exchange for Physical to \u201cacquire and dispose\u201d of bitcoin. It would also hold spot bitcoin, bitcoin futures contracts as well as cash and cash equivalents. It would list on the New York Stock Exchange alongside Grayscale if that fund is converted.\n\nThe updated fund would trade under its futures ticker DEFI.\n\nThe move, Seyffart posted at the end of August, \u201ccornered\u201d the SEC and commissioner Gary Gensler.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nFranklin Templeton\n\nFinancial services giant Franklin Templeton also entered the spot bitcoin ETF race in September. It seeks to list its fund on the Cboe BZX exchange. Like most of the other applicants, the firm tapped Coinbase as its custodian.\n\nThe proposed bitcoin ETF\u2019s comment period began at the end of November, leading some to believe that the SEC\u2019s move to start the period earlier than anticipated increases the possibility that bitcoin ETFs get a green light at the beginning of January.\n\nThe ETF, Franklin Templeton wrote in its initial proposal, would be a \u201cseries\u201d within the Franklin Templeton Digital Holdings Trust.\n\nPando Asset Management\n\nThe newest entrant to the spot bitcoin ETF race, Pando filed its proposal on November 29. The ETF, if cleared by the SEC, would list on Cboe \u2014 the exchange was picked by 8 of the 13 applicants.\n\nThe firm officially filed its 19b-4 earlier this week, officially putting them in the running for an ETF.\n\nThe Swiss asset manager has multiple crypto products trading on the SIX Swiss Exchange, but this would be its first US crypto offering.\n\nCoinbase would be the fund\u2019s custodian, and Pando tapped BNY Mellon as the trust administrator.\n\nWith its late entrance, it\u2019s unclear if Pando will be able to launch its ETF at the same time as, say, BlackRock or Ark if they get the go-ahead from the SEC.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Recession won't keep bitcoin from reaching new highs in 2024, VanEck predicts in yearly crypto forecast - The Block",
        "content": "Despite anticipating a long-forecast U.S. recession will finally hit next year, investment manager VanEck still sees expected spot ETF approvals and the upcoming halving event leading to new all-time highs for bitcoin by the fourth quarter, according to a new report.\n\nVanEck analysts Matthew Sigel and Patrick Bush expect the U.S. economy to succumb to a recession in the first half of 2024 as slowing economic momentum and cooling inflation leave it more vulnerable to shocks. However, the analysts also expect more than $2.4 billion will flow into U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in Q1 and keep prices elevated, if they're approved.\n\nVanEck believes the spot bitcoin ETFs would trade at around 0.1% spreads, with zero commission at many brokerages, catalyzing demand.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., having previously approved futures-based funds in 2021. The next deadlines for the SEC\u2019s decision to approve, reject or delay applications from firms including VanEck as well as BlackRock, Bitwise, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity and Valkyrie are expected to fall in mid-January. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart recently said the window for potential spot bitcoin ETF approval was looking like it would fall between Jan. 5 and Jan. 10.\n\nBitcoin's halving and all-time highs\n\nBitcoin BTC -5.50% \u2019s fourth halving \u2014 when the block reward gets cut in half \u2014 is expected to fall in April and is another potential catalyst, with prior halvings preceding significant run-ups for the cryptocurrency in 2016-2017 and 2020-2021. The VanEck analysts expect the event to pass with \"minimal drama,\" with bitcoin rising above $48,000 post-halving and miners seeing little distress thanks to much-improved balance sheets.\n\nThe analysts then expect bitcoin to climb a \"Presidential-sized wall of worry\" in the U.S. election year to reach an all-time high by November and an ultimate cycle peak of up to $160,000. \u201cIf bitcoin reaches $100,000 by December, we make a long-shot call that Satoshi Nakamoto will be named Time Magazine's 'Man of the Year,'\" they added.\n\nBitcoin currently trades at $44,006, up 165% year-to-date, according to The Block's price data.\n\nEther won\u2019t flip bitcoin, but solana will continue to outperform\n\nSigel and Bush said ether won\u2019t flip bitcoin\u2019s market cap in 2024, particularly with bitcoin's more apparent regulatory status, but it will outperform mega-cap tech stocks. Like past cycles, VanEck expects bitcoin to lead the rally next year, with ether not beginning to outperform until after the halving. But there will be no \"flippening,\" they said.\n\nTHE SCOOP Keep up with the latest news, trends, charts and views on crypto and DeFi with a new biweekly newsletter from The Block's Frank Chaparro By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy EMAIL Also receive The Daily and our weekly Data & Insights newsletters - both are FREE By signing-up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe ETH -5.98% :BTC price ratio is currently near its lowest level since July 2022 at around 0.05.\n\nThe analysts argued that ether will also lose market share to other smart contract platforms with less uncertainty surrounding scalability, such as Solana SOL +7.89% . They also expect Ethereum Layer 2s, such as Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism, to consolidate toward two or three dominant players by value and usage \u2014 with one achieving higher monthly DEX volume and Total Value Locked than Ethereum for the first time.\n\nVanEck anticipates solana becoming a top three cryptocurrency by market cap in 2024, behind bitcoin and ether, fueled by a rise in DeFi activity on the blockchain to join the \"spot ETF wars\" with the top two digital assets.\n\nBinance to lose top spot, and NFT activity rebound\n\nThe VanEck analysts also expect Binance to lose its throne as the top crypto exchange by spot trading volume in 2024 after the company\u2019s $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities and a year of regulatory issues for the platform.\n\nThe analysts argued one of OKX, Bybit or Coinbase would grab the top spot, though they also expect the decentralized exchange share of spot market trading volume compared to centralized exchanges to reach new all-time highs.\n\nAdditionally, Sigel and Bush anticipate a rebound in NFT activity to reach all-time highs next year as speculators gravitate toward top collections on Ethereum and new Bitcoin-based offerings. They also expect a breakout blockchain game to finally arrive.\n\nAmong VanEck's other expectations for the year ahead, its analysts saw the stablecoin market cap reaching a new all-time high as USDC reverses its market share losses this year and the DeFi industry reconciling with the idea of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) functionality on their front-ends.\n\nIt should be noted that VanEck may hold positions in any digital assets it mentions."

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Bitcoin This Year? Or Is This Just the Start of a New Bull Market for Crypto? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's hard to believe Bitcoin (BTC -5.55%) is up more than 50% in Q3, hit a new 52-week high of nearly $44,000, and is up more than 160% in 2023. By nearly every account, it seems that Bitcoin has shaken off the frost from a brutal crypto winter.\n\nYet, given the magnitude of the gains this year, is it possible that investors have missed the Bitcoin boat? The answer might surprise you, but several signs indicate Bitcoin's best days remain ahead for three key reasons.\n\nCyclical growth\n\nSimilar to the stock market, Bitcoin goes through phases. This isn't some novel insight. Cycles of growth, like we saw in 2021, are followed by periods of contraction. While those down periods can be painful, they are only natural.\n\nAt the start of 2022, a brutal crypto contraction began. Bitcoin fell by 65% at its lowest point in that cycle, and the overall crypto market cap slumped by 80%. But now, a new growth cycle is starting, and it is right on time with historical trends. There is some ambiguity when measuring the durations of bull and bear markets, but history shows that the average bear market lasts around 300 days or so. By most estimates, this most recent crypto winter was its longest ever at nearly 490 days. Put simply, based solely on the patterns of the past, we are a bit overdue for a recovery.\n\nIf this is the beginning of a new bull market, as it looks to be, it means there is still plenty of room for Bitcoin to run. In bull markets, it hasn't been uncommon for Bitcoin to increase exponentially, with momentum often lasting for the greater part of a year.\n\nAnalyzing short-term drivers\n\nIn April 2024, Bitcoin will undergo its fourth halving event. These events are hardwired into Bitcoin's code, and occur every time 210,000 blocks are added to its blockchain -- roughly every four years. At those points, the amount of new tokens that Bitcoin miners are paid for solving hashes and verifying transactions on the blockchain is cut in half -- reducing the effective \"inflation\" rate at which new tokens are produced. This is one of the primary features that preserves Bitcoin's sound monetary policy, upholds its finite nature, and makes it an effective store of value.\n\nIn Bitcoin's early days, its inflation rate was more than 10%. But with three halvings under its belt, its inflation rate has since fallen to just 1.75% today. Yet in four short months, it will be reduced again and sit at a measly 0.875%. This process will continue until all 21 million coins are mined (more than a century from now), at which point Bitcoin will enter unprecedented territory.\n\nThe upcoming halving holds significant importance for many reasons, but the most compelling for investors is how it will alter the dynamics around supply and demand. Historically, some of Bitcoin's most impressive gains have come in the months after a halving as the market attempts to find a new equilibrium. With the passing of each halving, even if demand remains constant, the reduction in additional supply typically leads to an increase in prices as would-be buyers compete for fewer available bitcoins.\n\nBreaking down the long-term perspective\n\nThe first two points focused more on the short term to highlight how it isn't too late now to buy Bitcoin. But considering a more long-term perspective, I would entertain the notion that it might never be \"too late\" to buy Bitcoin.\n\nWhile short-term factors are essential to consider in your investment planning, when it comes to Bitcoin, this is a long-term game. More so than any other asset, Bitcoin rewards investors who have time frames of decades, not just months or years. The true power of Bitcoin comes when investors let the effects of multiple halvings compound. The longer one holds one's tokens, and the more halvings that pass, the greater the returns Bitcoin provides as new tokens become harder to create.\n\nYet, the most attractive reason for holding Bitcoin over the long term is that it is still early in its adoption. It is difficult to quantify accurately, but estimates suggest that around 15% of the world's population has adopted crypto so far. Add in additional drivers such as interest from financial institutions, the continuous debasement of fiat currencies, and general trends in cryptocurrency use among younger generations, and demand for those 21 million coins looks like it will come under even greater pressure.\n\nWhen considering Bitcoin from this perspective, its short-term jumps hold less significance, which should reduce some of the FOMO that often accompanies Bitcoin bull markets. There are plenty of tailwinds forming that should drive the price higher over the long term, making today a great time to buy Bitcoin."

        "title": "'Number go up': bitcoin's startling surge is inexplicable as ever - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nIf you ever see me, in any forum, recommending that people should buy crypto, then one of two things has happened. Either someone has created a deep fake of me, or I have been kidnapped. In the latter scenario, \u201cbuy crypto\u201d would be my secret distress signal. Call the cops.\n\nNonetheless, it is hard to ignore the startling rally in bitcoin. Trust me, I\u2019ve tried. Somehow, despite a swirling hellfire of regulatory aggression and legal strife afflicting several of the key institutions in this space, the price of this token has risen by 160 per cent this year (not a typo) to $44,000, in a rally that has accelerated sharply over the past week or so. That comfortably eclipses any traditional asset class on the planet.\n\nTo be clear, if people want to buy these tokens, I bear them no ill. People spend money on Crocs sandals, real ale and other things I don\u2019t like all the time. Similarly, taking a punt on a crypto token is just as valid as buying a lottery ticket or putting a fiver each way on the 1.40 at Kempton racecourse. Nothing wrong with that. If you want to do this, knock yourself out. I hope it makes you rich. If it does, the last laugh will be yours, so please don\u2019t bother sending the usual all-caps emails telling me I\u2019m an idiot \u2014 they\u2019ll just go in the file with the others.\n\nStill, what are the circumstances under which this works as an investment strategy? What does the price rise really mean? When the asset class is, say, stocks or bonds, investors have broadly agreed metrics and assumptions to answer those questions. But this is bitcoin. Strap in for a dizzying exercise of partially sensible but largely circular arguments that lots of reasonable people sincerely believe.\n\nZach Pandl is one of those people, who left a career in macro strategy at Goldman Sachs for a role as an analyst at Grayscale, which operates crypto investment trusts. \u201cI believe in the future of this,\u201d he says. But at the same time, \u201cI\u2019m not an ideological person here\u201d.\n\nPandl generally looks at the value of crypto tokens through the same lens as major currencies, which are broadly (and I stress broadly) determined by real interest rates and fund flows. Pandl reckons bitcoin\u2019s latest violent ascent is really down to the US Federal Reserve and the assumption it is done raising rates and may even cut them soonish. \u201cGold has noticed that, bonds have noticed that, and bitcoin has noticed that,\u201d he says. So far so plausible: the very large drop we have seen in bond yields recently boosts the relative allure of non-yielding assets like gold and crypto. But for Pandl, this is about more than just that.\n\nInstead, he says bitcoin is the only \u201cobvious competitor currency\u201d in the event that the US dollar is \u201cdebased\u201d. The euro, sterling, yen and renminbi do not, for him, pass the test. This requires you believe two things: that dollar debasement is really a thing, and that it can be replaced in its central role as the world\u2019s reserve currency by a token you cannot yet use to buy a cup of coffee. It\u2019s a stretch.\n\nApart from interest rates, another key short-term trigger often cited for bitcoin\u2019s latest rally is that the manifold well-publicised failures of crypto projects over the past year, and in particular last month\u2019s $4.3bn fine on Binance, could have been worse. My thought here is \u201capart from that, Mrs Lincoln, how was the play?\u201d But for those crypto proponents who are not in jail, the fact Binance still exists at all is a positive.\n\nThe big one though is investor demand. I am yet to meet a single chief investment officer or portfolio manager at any institutional money manager who has any interest in bitcoin. Boosters insist bitcoin is bringing in this kind of money, but beyond a few hedge funds, venture capital firms and family offices, the evidence for this is scant at best. Wealthy individuals are probably aware of bitcoin\u2019s latest leap, but even there, sector advisers are sceptical. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing more demand from the client side,\u201d said Christian Nolting, chief investment officer at Deutsche Bank Wealth Management. \u201cI have enough volatility on the bonds side, I don\u2019t need crypto for the vol,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is possible that if US regulators approve the launch of cash bitcoin exchange traded funds by institutions such as BlackRock, that might tempt more investors to seek exposure to crypto through them. This could, potentially, really be a breakthrough moment but the true demand is yet to be seen and it could already be priced in.\n\nThis is just one of the contradictory arguments here, though. At the same time, we are told crypto is up because sovereign citizens want to avoid government and regulatory intrusion, and it is up because it may be about to gain greater regulatory oversight. It is apparently simultaneously a bet on inflation falling, and a hedge against inflation rising. It is a currency, but also a speculative asset.\n\nThese things can\u2019t all be true at the same time. The fact is, different people buy crypto for all of these different reasons and more, contradictions be damned. The only thing the latest price rise tells you is that an unknown number of people are buying this illiquid token more enthusiastically than they were before. Number go up.\n\nkatie.martin@ft.com"

        "content": "Key Takeaways JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said he would close down crypto if he was the government during a Senate hearing on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Dimon has made negative comments about Bitcoin since at least 2014, JPMorgan Chase uses blockchain technology in their JPM Coin offering.\n\nDespite concerns regarding crypto regulation, the bitcoin price has been booming as anticipation for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval builds.\n\nThis week JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon expressed his opposition for cryptocurrencies and bitcoin at a Senate hearing, albeit not for the first time.\n\nDimon's been making public comments about crypto since at least 2014. While he has made seemingly contrasting statements over the years, his general thesis has been unwavering.\n\nHere's what he has said over the years and some context around JPMorgan's blockchain foray to help understand where Dimon actually stands on crypto.\n\n\n\n2014: Terrible Store Of Value\n\nDimon has been sharing his thoughts on bitcoin (BTCUSD) and other related technologies since at least 2014.\n\n\"It\u2019s a terrible store of value, it can be replicated over and over. It doesn\u2019t have the standing of a government,\" he told CNBC in an interview.\n\n\n\n2017: \"Fraud\", \"Worse Than Tulip Bulbs\"\n\nIn September 2017, Dimon called bitcoin a fraud, going as far as labeling it worse than tulip bulbs\u2014a reference to Tulipmania or the Tulip Bulb market bubble.\n\n\"I\u2019d fire them in a second,\" Bloomberg reported Dimon saying of any JPMorgan trader trading bitcoin \"For two reasons: It\u2019s against our rules, and they\u2019re stupid. And both are dangerous.\u201d\n\n2017: \"God Bless The Blockchain\"\n\nJust a month later in October, JPMorgan launched its blockchain initiative to help make interbank payments.\n\nThree days prior to that launch, Dimon talked up the potential for blockchain technology\u2014the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"I could care less about bitcoin. I don\u2019t know why I said anything about it. The blockchain is a technology which is a good technology. We actually use it. It will be useful in a lot of different things. God bless the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies, digital currencies, I think are also fine. JPMorgan moves $6 trillion around the world every day, and we don\u2019t do it in cash, it\u2019s done digitally. If it can be done digitally with the blockchain, so be it,\" CNBC reported Dimon saying.\n\nDimon did issue a warning to investors putting money into bitcoin, however, calling them \"stupid.\"\n\n2018: \"Regret\"\n\nAt the beginning of 2018, just a few months after JPMorgan's blockchain was launched, Dimon expressed regret over his bitcoin fraud remark from the year before in an interview with Fox Business.\n\n2019: JPM Coin Appears\n\nJPMorgan as an institution was taking big strides in incorporating blockchain technology into the realm of traditional finance. It experimented with its own dollar-backed digital coin akin to a stablecoin called JPM Coin for payments between clients, CNBC reported in February 2019.\n\nThe bank also made key hires and worked has grown JPM Coin, which is now said to account for a billion dollars worth of daily transactions.\n\n2023: \"Close It Down\"\n\n\"I've always been deeply opposed to crypto, bitcoin, etc,\" said Dimon in response to a question from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren at a Senate hearing on Wednesday. \"You pointed out the only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money launderers, [and] tax avoidance . . . If I was the government, I'd close it down,\" he added.\n\nDuring the hearing, both Dimon and Warren made the point that a problem with crypto is that it lives outside the traditional financial system, which has several safeguards in place to prevent the proliferation of illicit finance.\n\nWhile lack of regulation remains a contentious issue, many traditional finance firms are beginning to put their weight behind bitcoin. Blackrock (BLK) and Fidelity have filed their applications for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, that is currently awaiting regulatory approvals. The optimism around the ETF has fueled a resurgence in bitcoin prices.\n\nBlackrock has come around after harboring views similar to Dimon on bitcoin investing in 2019."

It incorporates a secure hardware device and recovery tools in case of loss. To approve transactions, users will need to authenticate with both their fingerprint and phone. Coinbase and Cash App are among the initial global partners for Bitkey.\n\nBlock emphasized that Bitkey employs three keys to secure Bitcoin, requiring any two keys to work together for moving Bitcoin or authorizing security-related actions like recovery or modifying settings. The wallet, operating in a 2-of-3 multi-signature framework, ensures that Bitkey cannot access or move a customer's Bitcoin without their participation.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, Block reported impressive financial results, recording $5.62 billion in revenue driven by strong sales growth from payment processors Cash App and Square. The company also achieved a $44 million profit on its Bitcoin investments, benefiting from the recent price recovery of BTC. Furthermore, Bitcoin transaction gross profit reached $45 million, a 22% increase year-over-year, with Block selling $2.42 billion worth of BTC to customers through Cash App.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "The crypto winter is thawing, and some of the biggest tokens on the market have come to life in just the past week. There wasn't any major news out from the industry, but there seems to be a very big mood shift happening across crypto.\n\nAccording to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Bitcoin (BTC -5.55%) is up 13.6%, Ethereum (ETH -5.99%) has gained 12.8%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 1.41%) has popped 20.2% over the past seven days. And there doesn't seem to be any end in sight to the momentum.\n\nIs the crypto winter over?\n\nThere have been a number of catalysts for the crypto market lately. The bullish move in the stock market has been a very \"risk-on\" move which has typically translated to cryptocurrencies moving higher as well.\n\nAirdrops, or giving away tokens to wallets on the blockchain, have also added hundreds of millions of dollars in liquidity to the market, and that's pushing the values of the better-known tokens higher.\n\nCrypto can be a very sentiment-driven market, and traders are seeing a lot of reasons to be bullish right now with institutions and individuals pouring money into crypto after nearly two years of money flowing out of the industry. On top of that, interest rates are falling and growth investors are getting more bullish, which correlated with the rise in crypto in 2021.\n\nMore work ahead\n\nFor the momentum to continue, crypto needs to develop more use cases and ways to generate value than just trading. That's being done in a lot of areas including payments and decentralized financial products. But many tokens and airdrops are simply riding the hype cycle without knowing where long-term value is going to come from.\n\nI think the current state of crypto looks a lot like the fear of missing out and \"you only live once\" trading that happened during the pandemic. But this time around the market is much more well known, and bigger institutions are starting to get involved.\n\nWhat investors should be wary of is the market crashing again if the economy slows down and interest rates don't come down as fast as expected. This crypto rally isn't necessarily built on a solid footing of improving regulations and improved use cases; it's more about speculation.\n\nWhile I'm bullish on the future of the blockchain, I don't think these moves in some cryptocurrencies are sustainable. Many tokens have little use other than trading, and their long-term prospects ultimately may end in values falling and investors losing their money. There are more established tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum that have proven to be stores of value or a place where there's development, but I wouldn't take the rise in altcoins as a sustainable jump. After a great week and an even better month, it may be time to take some gains in crypto."

Indeed, it brings to mind the decision this year by BlackRock, the world\u2019s top asset management firm, to seek approval for a Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded fund.\n\n\u201cThe entry of Ita\u00fa is a watershed moment for the sector in Brazil,\u201d Alexandre Vasarhelyi, founding partner at crypto investment firm BLP Crypto, told DL News.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nTraditional institutions are poised to dominate the market. In Brazil, banks such as Ita\u00fa, which are already authorised to operate by the central bank, can easily get approval to offer new crypto services.\n\n\u201cConsidering that these institutions already have a very high level of internal compliance, which makes them trustworthy among the general public, there is a possible scenario in which banks like Ita\u00fa and others could lead the crypto economy in Brazil,\u201d Daniel de Paiva Gomes, a partner at Brazilian law firm Vieira, Drigo e Vasconcellos, told DL News.\n\nPaying tax bills with crypto\n\nBrazilians have long been enamoured with crypto. Taxpayers in Rio de Janeiro can pay some of their bills to the city in crypto. And Brazil\u2019s crypto startup scene is bustling with activity.\n\nAlong with the US and Australia, Brazil, with a population of 214 million, is on course to have one of the world\u2019s highest crypto adoption rates, according to HedgewithCrypto study.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\n\u2018Brazil, unlike other countries like the US, does not follow the \u2018regulation by enforcement\u2019 line.\u2019 \u2014 Daniel de Paiva Gomes\n\nNow Ita\u00fa's rollout of crypto services may spur Brazilian lawmakers to take a more supportive position on digital assets, said Helo Passos, founder and CEO of Brazilian blockchain gaming company Trexx.\n\n\u201cWith the effective entry of a banking giant like Ita\u00fa, the pressure on Congress will be even greater for next year\u2019s calendar to think in terms of regulation,\u201d she told DL News.\n\nNot that the government has done nothing. Brazil has already approved the type of tailored legislation US crypto leaders have been seeking in vain from Washington.\n\nIn December of last year, the Brazilian government approved the Legal Framework for Virtual Assets in Brazil, also known as the Cryptoassets Act.\n\nThe bill provides definitions for virtual assets and virtual asset service providers. \u201cA virtual asset is a digital representation of value that can be traded or transferred electronically and used to make payments or for investment purposes,\u201d the law says.\n\nIt also establishes new criminal penalties for operations involving fraud, money laundering, and organised crime.\n\nCentral Bank support\n\nMost importantly, the bill officially gives the central bank the authority to regulate the digital assets industry. And the institution\u2019s president, Roberto Campos Neto, is a defender of the sector.\n\nThe only exception is for crypto assets that are also securities, which fall under the jurisdiction of Brazil\u2019s Comiss\u00e3o de Valores Mobili\u00e1rios \u2014 CVM for short, the equivalent of the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u201cBrazil, unlike other countries like the US, does not follow the \u2018regulation by enforcement\u2019 line,\u201d said de Paiva Gomes, the lawyer at Vieira. \u201cWe can say that regulators, such as the Central Bank and CVM, are attentive to the evolution of new technologies and are seeking to accommodate the regulatory framework.\u201d\n\nThanks to the CVM, Brazilian investment funds for the general public can now allocate up to 10% of their holdings into digital assets, shares of local crypto funds, offshore crypto funds, or offshore crypto exchange-traded products.\n\nThe catch: They must get their exposure from companies either registered with Brazil\u2019s central bank or with a regulatory body abroad.\n\nRegistered funds\n\nThis leaves Brazilian funds with little choice.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, only a handful of Brazilian institutions registered with the central bank were offering crypto asset services, according to a report in Valor Globo, the largest financial newspaper in Brazil.\n\nAnd internationally, Coinbase is one of the few registered international exchanges with enough liquidity to meet Brazilian investment fund demand.\n\nThis is where Ita\u00fa's crypto development may have an impact down the line.\n\nWhile the firm only offers retail Bitcoin and Ethereum trading services at the moment, Guto Antunes, Ita\u00fa's head of digital assets, told Reuters that the bank plans to expand its range of available currencies in the future.\n\n\u2018Ita\u00fa\u2019s move marks a movement towards the institutionalisation of the crypto economy.\u2019 \u2014 Daniel de Paiva Gomes\n\nIta\u00fa already provides crypto custody services and is working on tokenizing financial assets.\n\nIta\u00fa's move \u201cmarks a movement towards the institutionalisation of the crypto economy,\u201d said de Paiva Gomes.\n\nIta\u00fa Unibanco was born out of a merger between Banco Ita\u00fa and Unibanco \u2014 two of Brazil\u2019s oldest banks, founded in 1945 and 1924 respectively. The bank counted roughly $169 billion in assets under management in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, Ita\u00fa CEO Milton Maluhy Filho said that crypto was not a fad and that the bank was \u201cmonitoring the area of digital assets, using this technology for an increasingly tokenizable world.\u201d\n\nTom Carreras is DL News\u2019 correspondent in Latin America.

        "content": "In our Chart of the Week, we compare the performance of the oldest and best-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, with the performance of the S&P 500. Over the last 10 years, Bitcoin has outperformed the S&P 500 close to 2,200-fold.[3] At the same time, Bitcoin's returns have been notoriously volatile, which is perhaps unsurprising, given its evolving ecosystem, the wide range of plausible scenarios for future applications of Bitcoin and the still unfolding potential of its underlying blockchain technology.[4] Thus, Bitcoin's outperformance appears less impressive on a risk-adjusted basis.\n\nEspecially noteworthy in the chart is the rolling last 12-month correlation between daily Bitcoin returns and equity returns. As can be seen in the chart, the correlation sharply fluctuated around a low level of less than 0.2 for most of the observation period. Investors were therefore able to cushion price fluctuations in equities by investing in bitcoin and, perhaps more importantly, vice versa. Only since the start of the Covid pandemic has there been a clear trend break. Since then, the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 has risen significantly. Reasons for the increasing correlation between equities and cryptocurrencies could partly lie in the increasing adoption by retail and institutional investors that gained access to the young asset class via for example crypto trading platforms and crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs).[5] However, it would be premature to read too much into the tighter correlations post pandemic, not least given recent declines. We believe that the main reason for the spike in correlation is simply the sharp fall in all risky assets during the covid pandemic. It is a well-known feature of markets that correlations spike in times of turmoil.[6]"

        "title": "BRC-20 tokens are presenting new opportunities for Bitcoin buyers - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "As the first blockchain and cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) paved the way for everything that\u2019s come since: nonfungible tokens (NFTs), smart contracts, tokenization, layer-2 solutions, and all the rest. Due to Bitcoin\u2019s value to the cryptosphere, forming the bedrock that supports the rest of the market, its protocol is rarely altered. With hundreds of billions of dollars and global trust in the decentralized network at stake, it doesn\u2019t make sense to meddle.f\n\nWhile the ossification of Bitcoin\u2019s codebase has brought stability and reliability, it\u2019s made Bitcoin a little\u2026 well, boring. Where once the Bitcoin ecosystem formed a hub of innovation and a hive of activity, that momentum has shifted to second- and third-generation chains whose architecture is better suited to supporting multiple use cases and applications. At least that was the case until the emergence of Ordinals, a technology that has sparked a new wave of innovation on Bitcoin.\n\nThroughout 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem developed rapidly. Emerging asset types, exemplified by Ordinals NFTs and BRC-20 tokens, have sparked widespread community enthusiasm, leading to a substantial increase in BTC miners' earnings.\n\nRelated: Expect some crypto companies to fail in the wake of Bitcoin's halving\n\nNow, tokens can be issued on the Bitcoin network by projects whose very security is anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain. And the best part? Ordinals haven't required changing a single line in Bitcoin\u2019s code. Furthermore, the BRC-20 standards are evolving rapidly, positioning them to become an indispensable new element within the BTC ecosystem in the future.\n\nOne coin spawns many tokens\n\nOrdinals is a protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Each Bitcoin can be broken down into 100 million units, known as sats. Each of these sats can be given a unique identifier using Ordinals and transferred over the Bitcoin network with this data attached. The Ordinals concept, developed by Casey Rodarmor, has proven phenomenally successful. It's opened the floodgates to a wave of Bitcoin-based NFTs. Because of it, a virtually infinite number of tokens can now be traded on Bitcoin.\n\nTrends in the $1.4 billion BRC-20 market as of Dec. 7, 2023. Source: CoinGecko\n\nAt first, Ordinals were latched onto by tech-minded Bitcoiners who could meet the high bar for minting and trading them. The process, after all, requires sending a sat to a Taproot-compatible wallet and inscribing metadata with the transaction. Initially, this required running a Bitcoin node and having familiarity with a command line interface, but code-free solutions have since emerged and have been responsible for mainstreaming Ordinals, particularly for the benefit of the Ethereum community.\n\nNFTs were the first use case for the Ordinals protocol, but the same technology can be used to issue fungible tokens, similar to the ERC-20 tokens that Ethereum supports. In fact, the token standard that\u2019s emerged for these Bitcoin-native assets even bears the same naming structure: BRC-20.\n\nAlready, there are BRC-20 projects springing up with Bitcoin-based tokens, forming a fledgling tokenized ecosystem that\u2019s coalescing around Bitcoin and Ordinals. Several of these tokens have captured the market\u2019s imagination, finding their way to tier-1 exchanges and spreading the word about the BRC-20 takeover in the process.\n\nFrom sats to SATS\n\nMany of the communities that have formed around Ordinals and Bitcoin are focused on fun, first and foremost. Gaming, collecting, speculating, socializing and interacting ahead of serious stuff like enterprise or institutional usage. $SATS is the perfect case in point. Bitcoin\u2019s very own memecoin, SATS is naturally a BRC-20 token, but it\u2019s also so much more.\n\nDaily Ordinal inscriptions by type from the day the first Ordinal was minted on Dec. 14, 2022, through Feb. 24, 2023. Source: Chainlink\n\nA total supply of 2,100,000,000,000,000 means $SATS is literally the Bitcoin supply times 100 million. In other words, there\u2019s a SAT for every sat. Projects like this may not be changing the world, but they\u2019re making Bitcoin fun again, and in the process, educating newcomers on key characteristics that are enshrined in Bitcoin\u2019s architecture.\n\nOther BRC-20 tokens have also carved out market share while bolstering the case for Ordinals on Bitcoin. The combined market capitalization of all BRC-20 tokens stands a little higher than $1.4 billion as of Dec. 7 \u2014 most of which can be attributed to ORDI \u2014 which suggests there is still plenty of room for growth.\n\nTaproot made tokens possible\n\nThe idea of issuing tokens on the Bitcoin network can\u2019t be found in the Bitcoin whitepaper: that use case hadn\u2019t been envisioned in 2008. In fact, it wasn\u2019t even possible to do so back then. It was not until the Taproot upgrade, which went live on the Bitcoin network in November 2021, that this became possible. Ordinals sprung up three months later, and the NFTs it spawned have been followed by an assortment of BRC-20 token projects.\n\nTaproot allows data to be added to block space, providing a means of minting tokens on Bitcoin. A single satoshi is minted and information concerning an entire set of fungible tokens is attached. This is done using JSON data where the token\u2019s name, ticker, supply and like qualities are added. Despite sharing the same naming structure as ERC-20, it\u2019s clear that BRC-20 tokens work very differently. This isn\u2019t surprising given that they are, technically, a workaround for a network that wasn\u2019t designed to support tokens.\n\nWhile the architecture may be unorthodox, the net result is the same. Just as communities formed around shared tokens and shared interests following the launch of Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 token standard, something similar is occurring on Bitcoin. BRC-20s aren\u2019t beloved by all Bitcoiners, it should be noted: some take exception to the block space the tokens take up, which can cause fees to spike. Others simply aren\u2019t interested in anything that isn\u2019t pure BTC.\n\nLook to the future\n\nWhen Ethereum launched, it had the ability to support a rich and diverse ecosystem of token-based projects \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what it did eventually. It took time for the communities to form and tooling to be built out, however. Bitcoin and the BRC-20 standard are currently where Ethereum was in 2017: full of potential that has yet to be realized.\n\nRelated: 3 theses that will drive Ethereum and Bitcoin in the next bull market\n\nKey infrastructure connecting Bitcoin tokenization to the EVM chains is being completed, with MultiBit the latest project to make headway here, launching a two-way bridge for BRC-20 and ERC-20 transfers. 12 months from now, what will the BRC-20 landscape resemble, and what opportunities will it have delivered to those bold enough to have gotten in early? The surge of ERC-20 tokens and ICOs in 2017 propelled Ether\u2019s (ETH) price thirtyfold within a year. While current market dynamics are different, the prospect of Bitcoin replicating Ethereum\u2019s success remains promising.\n\nFor a growing band of supporters who are tired of what they perceive as stagnation on Ethereum and who don\u2019t quite fit in with Bitcoin maximalists, Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens have made crypto fun again. To them, the movement represents a return to Bitcoin\u2019s experimental, creative roots. If there\u2019s a chance to make some money along the way, while advancing their understanding of Bitcoin and spreading memes into the bargain, all the better.\n\nGracy Chen is the managing director of the crypto derivatives exchange Bitget, where she oversees market expansion, business strategy, and corporate development.

        "content": "Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have been gleefully declared dead more than a few times during bear markets, but some experts say it would take a genuinely extreme set of events for it to truly die.\n\nAccording to 99Bitcoins \u2014 a website that, among other things, tracks how many times Bitcoin (BTC) has been declared dead by mainstream media outlets \u2014 the largest crypto by market cap has died 474 times since 2010.\n\nOften, the proclamation is met with cheering by crypto skeptics as evidence that BTC is not a viable asset, but it might not be so simple to kill off crypto \u2014 at least according to some experts in the space.\n\nA year ago #Bitcoin hit $69,000. One of the main reason for the spectacular rally was all the leverage that funded unprecedented #crypto advertising and speculative buying. The #FTX bankruptcy proves the entire rally was a fraud. It will never be repeated. Bitcoin mania is over. \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 11, 2022\n\nTomasz Wojewoda, head of business development at BNB Chain, is confident it would take more than a bear market or crypto winter to end BTC and the crypto market, even though it\u2019s been a particularly harsh downswing since the all-time highs of 2021.\n\nA bear market is when the value of crypto has fallen by at least 20% and continues to fall, while a crypto winter is a prolonged period of depressed asset prices in the market.\n\nWojewoda told Cointelegraph that, in his opinion, the only way BTC and the broader crypto market could die would be if something extreme happened, such as the underlying community losing interest and everyone exiting the space at once.\n\nHowever, he doesn\u2019t see this happening anytime soon. Regardless of fiascos like the FTX saga and other dramas in the space, Wojewoda believes there is always \u201cgoing to be demand for crypto.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe crypto market, like any market in the economy, moves in waves and trends upward or downward depending on market sentiment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market has been through multiple bear markets, but historically, we have seen the market recover from similar trends.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, 2013, 2017 and 2021, crypto saw huge spikes in value, only to come crashing back down to earth. So far, after each crash, the price has recovered years down the road.\n\nOverall, this bear market and crypto winter has been particularly savage. After reaching highs of over $69,000 in 2021, BTC lost more than 60% of its value in 2022, according to CoinGecko. As of 2023, it has recovered some, but BTC is still roughly 40% down since its all-time highs.\n\nAccording to Wojewoda, challenging times like these \u201ccan actually be positive for the industry\u201d and not a sign that crypto is dying, even though it may feel like it. Specifically, he thinks market crashes can help weed out bad actors.\n\nRelated: Security audits \u2018not enough\u2019 as losses reach $1.5B in 2023, security professional says\n\nHe also sees it as a time when \u201cstrong projects focus on building and improving the user experience.\u201d\n\nRegulation won\u2019t kill crypto\n\nBanking regulators appear to be trying to kill or dismantle the crypto industry, brandishing an array of lawsuits and an intimidating flood of regulatory measures. There are fears this could spell doom for the industry.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Chair Gary Gensler, has been particularly aggressive against crypto firms. According to Gensler, his agency has filed over 780 enforcement actions in 2023, including over 500 standalone cases.\n\n1/ Today Coinbase received a Wells notice from the SEC focused on staking and asset listings. A Wells notice typically precedes an enforcement action. \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) March 22, 2023\n\nCrypto and BTC have survived, though. Regulations have been slow to come and, in some cases, poorly created. Wojewoda thinks some form of regulation can ultimately be a good thing for the industry and will not be the reason it dies.\n\n\u201cGlobal regulations can impact the growth of crypto; however, with more countries embracing crypto worldwide, I don\u2019t think this will be a reason for crypto to \u2018die off,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRegulation in the industry is a good thing. It keeps users safe, and a clear framework enables the industry to build around it.\u201d\n\nSome crypto will probably die, but the industry will survive\n\nWojewoda is convinced the crypto market will reach the other side of this crypto winter and beyond. He thinks it will likely survive as a concept, but not all projects and currencies will make it long-term.\n\nAccording to Exploding Topics, there are over 10,500 different cryptocurrencies in existence as of November 2023. However, it\u2019s estimated that only 8,848 are still active in the space, with the others dropping off or dying.\n\n\u201cProjects that didn\u2019t have a real-life use case died off, but the ones that truly make an impact have not only survived but thrived,\u201d Wojewoda said.\n\n\u201cThere are many things that can impact the trajectory of crypto, such as sentiment, regulation and other factors \u2014 for example, the Bitcoin ETF filing and upcoming Bitcoin halving,\u201d he added.\n\nNew Research note from me today. We still believe 90% chance by Jan 10 for spot #Bitcoin ETF approvals. But if it comes earlier we are entering a window where a wave of approval orders for all the current applicants *COULD* occur pic.twitter.com/u6dBva1ytD \u2014 James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 8, 2023\n\nIn the long run, along with weaker hands dropping off, Wojewoda believes it\u2019s not \u201cout of the realm of possibility\u201d that some crypto will be replaced by new, better tech.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t think BTC will be among the casualties because its network effect and user base give it a significant advantage over other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cBitcoin will likely remain as the most popular crypto in terms of market share. Where I think we will likely see more movement in the ranks is among cryptocurrencies that offer real-world applications,\u201d Wojewoda said.\n\n\u201cThese projects have applications beyond digital currencies, and the tech is continuously evolving, finding new use cases and applications for the real world.\u201d\n\nRelated: Massive\u2019 crypto use cases to surface by 2030\n\nThese applications are one of the reasons Wojewoda thinks the market will endure long term. While not all will make it, the broader crypto market and BTC will survive.\n\nThe market will bounce back, with BTC still standing\n\nMarkus Thielen, head of research and strategy for digital asset investment firm Matrixport, is also skeptical that a bear market or crypto winter poses a genuine threat to the crypto market and BTC.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Thielen said that while many people exit the space during bear markets, it\u2019s a normal part of the process, not a sign of crypto\u2019s impending death.\n\n\u201cMany people have excited the crypto industry during the last year, as those firms have expanded near the top of the last bull market,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWithout sufficient revenues and additional capital injections from venture capital funds, those crypto firms have to right-size their companies.\u201d\n\nRight-sizing a company is the process of restructuring to make profits more efficiently and meet updated business objectives. Right-sizing usually involves reducing workforces, shifting around upper management and other cost-cutting measures.\n\n\u201cAs long as there is value being sent around electronically, crypto has a value proposition that is difficult to match with the traditional banking rails,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nSo far, there have been four bull markets \u2014 2011, 2013, 2017 and 2021 \u2014 and record numbers of people have entered the space each time, only to disappear when the bears strike. A bull market is characterized by rising prices and investor optimism.\n\nRelated: \u2018Strap yourselves in\u2019 \u2014 Bull market coming early 2024, say crypto exchange heads\n\nAccording to Thielen, each bull market is being built upon a new narrative, which will continue to be the case. He says there will likely be another narrative for a fifth bull market very soon.\n\n\u201cWith regulators approving Bitcoin futures in 2017 and potentially a Bitcoin ETF in 2024, the regulatory level playing field is cemented,\u201d Thielen said.\n\n\u201cI can not imagine Bitcoin ever disappearing, as the idea of Bitcoin plays into the hands of human fallacy.\u201d"

        "content": "As of early Friday morning, this week was shaping up to be a banner one for altcoins. Among many others, integration cryptocurrency Polkadot (DOT -1.90%) had advanced by 13% week to date by that point, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nMeanwhile, a pair of alternates to the top two coins -- Ethereum Classic (ETC -6.41%) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC -5.63%) -- also came along for the ride, S&P Global Market Intelligence figures reveal. The former was up 16%, while the latter had advanced by 12%.\n\nMany cryptos continued their sprint\n\nCryptocurrencies remain in the throes of a major and sustained rally. It just so happens that the dominant one, Bitcoin of course, seemed to be taking a pause by the end of the week. It dipped a little in price after hitting a recent peak of a hard-to-believe $45,000 on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThat was like the lead runner in a race slowing a bit to conserve energy. As Bitcoin cooled (along with its cousin Wrapped Bitcoin, which sits on the Ethereum blockchain), investment money found its way into other coins and tokens and they surged ahead.\n\nEthereum was one beneficiary, hence the pop in its origin blockchain Ethereum Classic. Polkadot, which has won kudos for the blockchain interoperability it facilitates, was another.\n\nThere was little material reason for the Bitcoin pause; it's likely that profit-taking was among the factors. Yet optimism abounds. Recent employment statistics are heating up speculation that the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates before long, reversing its recent habit. This compounds steeper-than-expected declines in inflation data.\n\nThat is encouraging for cryptocurrency investors because the sunnier the economic future seems to be, the more adventurous the market gets. That being said, however, there wasn't any new development on the macroeconomic front. The cryptoverse continued to be buoyed by the not-so-fresh news of previous days.\n\nThe hope of spot crypto ETFs\n\nOne potentially strong market-pusher currently on hold is the future of spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Last month there were several pieces of news tilting in favor of these securities, which have been concocted by some top names in the finance industry (like BlackRock with its proposed Bitcoin ETF).\n\nAlas, still none have yet been approved by the crypto-skeptical U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; the hot gossip is that this will occur very soon. But gossip isn't occurrence, and while the prospect of spot crypto ETFs is exciting, their future remains in limbo. Investors continue to hope for a slew of approvals, however, and that's helping to sustain the rally."

Has given back all the gains from the move up the other day,\u201d he wrote in the X post.\n\n\u201cIf it breaks and closes below 51.81 it would be the first lower low in over a year and an end to the uptrend, along with a likely top put in.\u201d\n\nBitcoin crypto market cap dominance annotated chart.

        "title": "12 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to hedge funds. If you want to skip our overview of the explosive cryptocurrency sector that continues to surprise, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\n\n2023 has been the year of artificial intelligence. It started with doom and gloom all around as investors were reeling from high interest rates and predictions of a recession. This environment does not bode well for high growth areas such as cryptocurrency, and naturally, these stocks were poor performers. In fact, 2022 was a bloodbath for the cryptocurrency industry and stocks, as high interest rates incentivized capital to flow into stable savings accounts and the money market, which left cryptocurrency in the dust.\n\nFor instance, the price of Bitcoin which is the world's premier cryptocurrency and a widely known benchmark for the sector, tanked to below $16,500 in November 2022. This time period was one of the worst for growth assets, as back then the Federal Reserve was pumping up interest rates by massive 75 point hikes a piece. At the same time, just as crypto was struggling to find its footing, calamity hit the cryptocurrency sector as cryptocurrency exchange FTX declared bankruptcy. While declaring bankruptcy itself is not particularly controversial as several firms go through the process, FTX's liquidation was far from ordinary.\n\nThis is because at the heart of the FTX saga was the question of legitimacy that cryptocurrency critics have continued to worry about. Since Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are not backed by any assets, their value is thought to be purely speculative and determined by market sentiment alone. In the case of FTX, it was revealed that the firm funneled customer deposits into speculative investments - including its own token - and when these investments crashed, it lost customer money. A fraud of epic proportions, it saw FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried face trial for exactly a year before being convicted on all seven counts that prosecutors had brought against him.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, while FTX is a thing of the past, Bitcoin surely isn't. After dropping to multi-year lows in 2022, the world's favorite cryptocurrency is basking in the evolving financial markets environment of 2023. Year to date, Bitcoin has gained a respectable 151% on the market, and its current price of ~$42,000 is the highest level at which it has been in 2023. There are several reasons behind this surge. One of these is the expected easing in financial conditions that has also fueled the flagship S&P 500 stock index and the NASDAQ indexes in November. Lower interest rates naturally fuel riskier assets as investors want alternative avenues for a return, and Bitcoin is perhaps the riskiest of all assets.\n\nApart from the financial conditions, the nature of Bitcoin's price is also at play these days, Since, unlike say for shares of the Cupertino, California technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reflect Apple's financial heft and future market potential, Bitcoin's price is a reflection of market sentiment, it appreciates when investors are optimistic. These indicators of optimism primarily revolve around the growing adoption and removal of regulatory constraints surrounding Bitcoin. Now, one of the biggest tailwinds for Bitcoin's price is a potential approval of an exchange traded fund (ETF) that would improve investor access to the cryptocurrency by allowing stock market participants to also trade in Bitcoin. The potential for this fund is no laughing matter since estimates show that should such a fund be approved by the S.E.C., then a whopping $3 billion could flow into it on the first day and up to $55 billion over the next five years.

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently met with Fidelity Investments to seek additional clarity on its spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) application.\n\nAccording to a filing published on Dec. 7, two Cboe BZX Exchange representatives, six SEC personnel and nine Fidelity personnel met to discuss the workings of the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust.\n\n\u201cThe discussion concerned Cboe BZX\u2019s proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust under Cboe BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4). Fidelity also provided the attached presentation.\u201d\n\nThe filing incorporated PowerPoint slides used during the meeting to illustrate the operational framework of the Bitcoin ETF.\n\nAP as agency model graph. Source: SEC\n\n\u201cArbitrage and hedge are more efficient with physical creations,\u201d the filing stated while proposing the most effective strategy to the U.S. regulator:\n\n\u201cAllowing for physical creation and redemption is critical to enhance trading efficiency and secondary market pricing for all participants.\u201d\n\nFidelity submitted a spot Bitcoin ETF application to the SEC on June 19, shortly after BlackRock and several other asset managers filed for the product.\n\nHowever, the SEC previously rejected Fidelity\u2019s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in 2022.\n\nThis comes after recent news that the SEC is meeting with spot Bitcoin ETF applicants to discuss various aspects of their applications.\n\nCointelegraph recently reported that based on industry insider knowledge, the meetings discussed \u201ckey technical details\u201d related to U.S. exchanges listing shares of a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nRelated: Fidelity seeks green light for Ethereum ETF, following BlackRock\u2019s filing\n\nHowever, memos released by the SEC in November showed the commission separately met with representatives of BlackRock and Grayscale.\n\nThere has been much speculation in recent times over when a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved.\n\nHashdex, one of the applicants among the 13 asset managers, anticipates seeing the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF by the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\u201cThe exact timing of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. remains unclear, but in 2023, the narrative around this product switched from a question of \u2018if\u2019 to a matter of \u2018when,\u2019\u201d said Hashdex\u2019s U.S. and Europe head of product Dramane Meite.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart remain confident that Jan. 10 will mark the simultaneous approval of all spot Bitcoin ETFs. This aligns with the SEC\u2019s deadline to either approve or deny ARK Invest\u2019s application.\n\nMagazine: Bitcoin ETF race has a new player, Binance ends support for BUSD, and more: Hodler\u2019s Digest: Nov. 26 \u2013 Dec. 2"

        "content": "Developers of Bitcoin side-chain MicroVisionChain (MVC) have unveiled a BRC-20 decentralized exchange (DEX) as part of its roadmap for Q1 2024.\n\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, MVC chief operating officer Jason Kwok claims to have developed a \u201c1:1 mapping relationship\u201d with Bitcoin on its sidechain. \u201cThis essentially creates a parallel version of your Bitcoin assets, such as BRC-20, on MVC,\u201d said Kwok, explaining that the bridge allows users to swap BRC-20 token assets on the MVC sidechain, thus bypassing the high transaction and gas fees required to deploy decentralized applications (DApps) on the Bitcoin mainnet.\n\n\u201cMVC shares the same underlying architecture as Bitcoin, which means the same mnemonic phrases and receiving addresses can be used across both. This significantly reduces the learning curve and enhances user-friendliness.\u201d\n\nIn keeping with the spirit of Bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, Kwok explains that MVC has no particular founders or corporate headquarters. Instead, the sidechain is a \u201ccollaborative endeavor\u201d involving many development teams that form the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nInvented by Web3 developer Rodarmor in January, BRC-20 tokens have surged in popularity as one of the largest technological advancements in a 15-year-old blockchain. Bitcoin Ordinals is a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each satoshi, or 1/100 millionth of a Bitcoin (BTC), enabling tracking and transfer. Combined with the inscription process, which adds a layer of data to each satoshi, users can mint unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe market cap of BRC-20 tokens has since exceeded $1.5 billion, led by memecoin Ordinals (ORDI), which is not associated with the Ordinals protocol.\n\nAs part of MVC\u2019s 2024 roadmap, Kwok says that the project is also developing a meta-contract integrated development environment (IDE) that would enable the migration of DApps from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to MVC\u2019s Bitcoin sidechain. \u201cThe meta-contract IDE is capable of compiling TypeScript, a high-level language, into the low-level op_code language on MVC. This process is a critical component in the development of MVC smart contracts and the expansion of BVM [Bitcoin Virtual Machine] DApps,\u201d he said.\n\nBVM aims to integrate the functionality of Turing-complete smart contracts into the Bitcoin architecture. Kwok said this is accomplishable by \u201cincorporating additional OP_CODES into Bitcoin\u2019s original structure and redefining the method of generating underlying transaction IDs.\u201d The process is also being adopted by developers Trustless Market, a Uniswap v2 fork that enabled $500,000 worth of swaps in its first three days.\n\nKwok stated that while current layer-2 solutions like the Bitcoin Lightning Network address issues related to scalability and low fees, they cannot onboard Bitcoin into the greater decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. \u201cBitcoin ecosystem applications, like wallets and NFT [nonfungible token] markets, can easily add support for MVC without requiring extensive additional development,\u201d said Kwok.\n\nMVC's roadmap for Q1 2024.

        "content": "Print this page\n\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\n\nHello and welcome to the latest edition of the FT\u2019s Cryptofinance newsletter.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t noticed, bitcoin is on a bit of a tear this month.\n\nIts 16 per cent gain in December alone takes the gains for the year to more than 160 per cent and the $44,000 price was last seen 20 months ago.\n\nLike Dorothy discovered in The Wizard of Oz, it was all a dream. The crashes, corporate failures, criminal charges and lawsuits that piled up on crypto in that period suddenly seem a distant memory.\n\nPeople such as Sam Bankman-Fried and Changpeng Zhao are no longer the top bosses but seen as the old guard on the way out and associated with past crimes and misdemeanours.\n\nAround the industry the confidence is tangible. Want to invest in a bitcoin private credit fund run by a start-up backed by Sam Altman? How about buying a crypto fund that is trading at as much as eight times its underlying value?\n\nThe tide is carrying in the future, in the form of a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund in the US. Mistakenly or not, the expectation is that it could come as soon as next month.\n\nThere is one unheralded aspect to this latest rally: the influence of Asia. The region has not been as forceful in clamping down on bad behaviour as the US.\n\nFor example, both South Korea and the US want to extradite Do Kwon, the entrepreneur behind the $40bn collapse of crypto token TerraUSD, to answer charges. But where South Korea wants to speak to him for allegedly violating capital market rules, the US has charged him with eight criminal counts, including securities, commodities and wire fraud.\n\n\u201cMuch of the regulatory crackdown we\u2019ve seen this year has happened firmly in the US. Singapore, Japan, South Korea, they\u2019re more hospitable to crypto,\u201d said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of investment adviser Lumida Wealth Management.\n\n\u201cThese markets are more speculative, and crypto subsectors like gaming are so much more popular out there,\u201d he added.\n\nSo much so that the main sovereign currency that people use to trade against crypto tokens is now the Korean won, not the US dollar.\n\nThe won accounts for 41 per cent of the market, according to CCData, up from 24 per cent in September. In the same period the US dollar\u2019s share of the market has fallen from 51 per cent to a tick under 40 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe fact that bitcoin broke through resistance in the Asian hours is a testament to how important retail volumes in that region, namely South Korea, are becoming,\u201d said Michael Safai, chief executive at trading firm Dexterity Capital.\n\n\u201cInstitutional grabs headlines, but retail flow is the lifeblood of the crypto markets,\u201d he added.\n\nThat resurgence is also shown in the market shares of OKX and Bybit, two of Asia\u2019s most popular exchanges.\n\nVolume in spot markets on OKX jumped to more than $71bn last month, more than double October\u2019s $33bn, and a height not seen since May 2022, CCData said. OKX\u2019s monthly derivatives volume also leapt to $659bn in November, up from $429bn in October.\n\nBybit\u2019s volumes are at a level last seen in February 2022. Last month it registered $56bn in spot volumes while derivatives volumes shot up to $375bn, up from the previous month\u2019s $262bn.\n\n\u201cA lot of crypto\u2019s speculative and retail firepower remains intact in Asia,\u201d Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex, told me.\n\nAnd notably, their gains have come at Binance\u2019s expense. OKX and Bybit started the year with a 4 and 1 per cent and Binance on 55. Now OKX has 8, Bybit 6 and Binance just 31 per cent.\n\n\u201cWall Street\u2019s crypto embrace doesn\u2019t just buoy institutions, it can reignite retail, including in other parts of the world, it\u2019s like a positive feedback loop,\u201d Solot added.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on bitcoin\u2019s recent rally and Asia\u2019s role in crypto markets? As always, email me your thoughts at scott.chipolina@ft.com.\n\nWeekly highlights\n\nLate on Thursday a US judge ruled that former Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao will remain in the US until his sentencing, which is due to take place in February. The judge said that, while Zhao offered a significant bail package, it was \u201cinadequate to ensure [Zhao\u2019s] return when considering the vast resources and assets at his disposal\u201d.\n\nKristin Johnson, commissioner at the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said the hefty $4.3bn penalty levied against Binance should serve as a warning to others. Speaking at the FT\u2019s Crypto and Digital Assets Summit, Johnson said: \u201cTake the hint, you could save yourself a lot in any number of different ways.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s third-largest bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale this week launched trading of its EUR CoinVertible stablecoin on crypto exchange Bitstamp, becoming the first major bank to launch its own dollar-pegged token on a crypto exchange.\n\nSoundbite of the week: You want answers?\n\nAt the FT\u2019s crypto summit on Tuesday I spoke to Richard Teng, Binance\u2019s new chief executive.\n\nHe\u2019s been in the role for just over two weeks since CZ stepped down as part of the DoJ settlement and has promised that Binance will learn from past mistakes. He\u2019d also stressed that users should feel confident in the strength, safety and stability of the exchange.\n\nWith this pledge in mind I asked the Binance chief some of the questions that have dogged the company in recent years, like where its company headquarters is or the status of an audit. Sadly, those questions still remain unanswered. At one point he said:\n\n\u201cWhy do you feel so entitled to these answers?\u201d And: \u201cIs there a need for us to share all of this information publicly? No.\u201d\n\nData mining: Hungry for more\n\nA decent indicator as to the durability of a rally is whether investors are buying a lot of something.\n\nNumbers shared by CCData suggest that may indeed be the case. Average weekly trading volumes across 25 of the top digital assets investment products, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust or ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, have hit the $3bn mark twice this quarter.\n\nVolumes are also showing some consistency and have sat comfortably over $2bn for four consecutive weeks, which suggests some real appetite out there.\n\nFT Cryptofinance is edited by Philip Stafford.

Also, BNB , Avalanche, Tron, Chainlink, Polkadot, Siba Inu, and Litecoin surged. On the other hand, XRP Dogecoin , and Toncoin declined.BTC encountered a dip to $43,000 during the day, pulling back from its swift ascent to nearly $45,000 earlier this week. This suggests that traders opted to secure profits after the largest crypto's breakout from $38,000 a week ago, said CoinDCX Research Team.On the flip side, ETH witnessed a 5% upswing over the same period, reaching $2,372, marking its highest level since May 2022. This upward movement also positively influenced the prices of other ETH-related cryptocurrencies, positioning them as the top performers of the day. Ethereum's upsurge is credited to heightened institutional interest and the hopeful anticipation of an ETF approval by the SEC, CoinDCX added.\"From a technical standpoint, BTC is currently situated at the $44,000 resistance level. The overall momentum remains positive, with no clear signals of a reversal or bearish trend. Minor pullbacks and corrections are considered healthy for the current scenario,\" CoinDCX said.Meanwhile, Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, said, \"The current phase of sideways correction is good for building steam for the next leg-up. If this trend continues, analysts predict the next stop for BTC will be $46,000.\"The total volume in DeFi is currently $8 billion, 10.77% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $65.78 billion, which is 88.55% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency , fell to $848 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 52.65%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours rose 7.91% to $28.25 billion."

        "title": "What Is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)? - Investopedia",
        "content": "What Is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)?\n\nCentral bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are a form of digital currency issued by a country's central bank. They are similar to cryptocurrencies, except that their value is fixed by the central bank and equivalent to the country's fiat currency.\n\nMany countries are developing CBDCs, and some have even implemented them. Because so many countries are researching ways to transition to digital currencies, it's important to understand what they are and what they mean for society.\n\nKey Takeaways A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is the digital form of a country's fiat currency.\n\nA nation's monetary authority, or central bank, issues a CBDC, which promotes financial inclusion and simplifies implementing monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nMany countries are exploring how CBDCs may affect their economies, financial networks, and stability.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)\n\nFiat money is a government-issued currency that has no backing from a physical commodity like gold or silver. It is considered a form of legal tender that can be used to exchange for goods and services. Traditionally, fiat money came as banknotes and coins, but technology has allowed governments and financial institutions to supplement physical fiat money with a credit-based model that records balances and transactions digitally.\n\nPhysical currency is still widely exchanged and accepted; however, some developed countries have experienced a drop in its use, and that trend accelerated during the pandemic.\n\nGovernments and central banks worldwide are exploring the possibility of using government-backed digital currencies. When and if they are implemented, these currencies would have the full faith and backing of the government that issues them, just as fiat money does.\n\nThe introduction and evolution of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have created further interest in cashless societies and digital currencies.\n\nGoals of CBDCs\n\nIn the U.S. and many other countries, many individuals don't have access to financial services. In the U.S. alone, 5% of adults didn't have a bank account in 2020. An additional 13% of U.S. adults who had bank accounts, instead used costly alternative services like money orders, payday loans, and check-cashing services.\n\nThe main goal of CBDCs is to provide businesses and consumers with privacy, transferability, convenience, accessibility, and financial security. CBDCs could also decrease the cost of maintenance that a complex financial system requires, reduce cross-border transaction costs, and provide those who currently use alternative money-transfer methods with lower-cost options.\n\nCBDCs would also reduce the risks associated with using digital currencies, or cryptocurrencies, in their current form. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, with their value constantly fluctuating. This volatility could cause severe financial stress in many households and affect the overall stability of an economy. CBDCs, backed by a government and controlled by a central bank, would give households, consumers, and businesses a secure means of exchanging digital currency.\n\nA CBDC also provides a country's central bank with the means to implement monetary policies to ensure stability, control growth, and influence inflation.\n\nTypes of CBDCs\n\nThere are two types of CBDCs, wholesale and retail. Financial institutions are the primary users of wholesale CBDCs, whereas consumers and businesses use retail CBDCs.\n\nWholesale CBDCs\n\nWholesale CBDCs are similar to holding reserves in a central bank. The central bank grants an institution an account to deposit funds or use to settle interbank transfers. Central banks can then use monetary policy tools, such as reserve requirements or interest on reserve balances, to influence lending and set interest rates.\n\n\n\nRetail CBDCs\n\nRetail CBDCs are government-backed digital currencies used by consumers and businesses. Retail CBDCs eliminate intermediary risk\u2014the risk that private digital currency issuers might become bankrupt and lose customers' assets.\n\nThere are two types of retail CBDCs. They differ in how individual users access and use their currency:\n\nToken-based retail CBDCs are accessible with private keys or public keys or both. This method of validation allows users to execute transactions anonymously.\n\nAccount-based retail CBDCs require digital identification to access an account.\n\nIt is possible to develop two types of CBDCs, wholesale and retail, and have them function in the same economy.\n\nIssues CBDCs Address and Create\n\nThe Federal Reserve has identified as critical requirements a CBDC meets, as well as matters that need to be addressed before one can be designed and implemented.\n\nIssues Addressed By CBDCs Free from credit and liquidity risk\n\nLowers cross-border payment costs\n\nSupports the international role of the dollar\n\nAims for financial inclusion\n\nExpands access to the general public Issues Created by CBDCs Financial structure changes\n\nFinancial system stability\n\nMonetary policy influence\n\nPrivacy and protection\n\nCybersecurity\n\nIssues Addressed By CBDCs Explained\n\nEliminates the third-party risk of events like bank failures or bank runs. Any residual risk that remains in the system rests with the central bank.\n\nCan lower high cross-border transaction costs by reducing the complex distribution systems and increasing jurisdictional cooperation between governments.\n\nCould support and protect U.S. dollar dominance; the U.S. dollar is still the most-used currency in the world.\n\n\n\nRemoves the cost of implementing a financial structure within a country to bring financial access to the unbanked population.\n\nCan establish a direct connection between consumers and central banks, thus eliminating the need for expensive infrastructure.\n\n\n\nIssues Created by CBDCs Explained\n\nIf the U.S. financial structure drastically changes, it's unknown how it would affect household expenses, investments, banking reserves, interest rates, the financial services sector, or the economy.\n\nEffects a switch to CBDC would have on a financial system's stability are also unknown. For example, there may not be enough central bank liquidity to facilitate withdrawals during a financial crisis.\n\nCentral banks implement monetary policy to influence inflation, interest rates, lending, and spending, which in turn affects employment rates. Central banks must ensure they have the tools needed to positively impact the economy.\n\nPrivacy is one of the most significant drivers behind cryptocurrency. CBDCs would require an appropriate amount of intrusion by authorities to monitor for financial crimes; monitoring is also important because it supports efforts to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n\nCryptocurrencies have been the target of hackers and thieves. A central bank-issued digital currency would likely attract the same crowd of thieves. Therefore, efforts to prevent system penetration and theft of assets and information would need to be robust.\n\nCBDCs vs. Cryptocurrencies\n\nThe cryptocurrency ecosystems provide a glimpse of an alternative currency system in which cumbersome regulations don't dictate the terms of each transaction. They are hard to duplicate or counterfeit and are secured by consensus mechanisms that prevent tampering.\n\nCentral bank digital currencies are designed to be similar to cryptocurrencies, but they may not require blockchain technology or consensus mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, cryptocurrencies are unregulated and decentralized. Their value is dictated by investor sentiments, usage, and user interest. They are volatile assets more suited for speculation, which makes them unlikely candidates for use in a financial system that requires stability. CBDCs mirror the value of fiat currency and are designed for stability and safety.\n\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies at a Glance\n\nCentral banks in many countries have pilot programs and research projects to determine the viability and usability of a CBDC in their economy. One example of a failed attempt is the United Kingdom's Britcoin, which existed between 2011 and 2019. As of March 2023, there were 11 countries and territories with CBDCs. They are the Bahamas, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, Monserrat, Dominica, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, and Nigeria. Eighteen countries now have a pilot program, including seven of the G20 economies, and 32 countries have a program in development. According to the Federal Reserve, the U.S. is one of those countries that is exploring whether a CBDC \"could improve on an already safe and efficient U.S. domestic payments system.\"\n\nIs CBDC a Cryptocurrency? Though the idea for central bank digital currencies stems from cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, CBDCs aren't cryptocurrencies. A central bank controls a CBDC, whereas cryptocurrencies are almost always decentralized, meaning they can't be regulated by a single authority, such as a bank.\n\nDoes the U.S. Have a CBDC? There is no U.S. CBDC. The Federal Reserve and its branches are researching CBDCs and ways to implement them in the U.S. financial system; President Joe Biden has ordered the development of a national strategy on digital currencies.\n\nIs a CBDC Based on a Blockchain? A CBDC can be based on a blockchain, but it doesn't need to be. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Digital Currency Initiative found in their research that distributed ledgers could hinder the efficiency and scalability of a CBDC.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nMany countries are developing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and 11 already have implemented them. A CBDC's main goal is to provide businesses and consumers with privacy, transferability, convenience, accessibility, and financial security. Many individuals throughout the world have no access to bank accounts, so a CBDC would give them a way to be paid, hold their money, and pay bills. CBDCs could also decrease the maintenance a complex financial system requires, reduce cross-border transaction costs, and give people who use alternative money-transfer methods lower-cost options."

        "title": "8 Crypto to consider buying now for the next bull run in 2024 - The Economic Times",
        "content": "Spotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Bitcoin recently hitting $44K for the first time since April 2022, time is running out to buy crypto\u2019s cheap before the bull run sends prices soaring. However, identifying the projects with the highest potential is challenging. We\u2019ve considered tokenomics, use cases, market trends, hype, and partnerships to provide the best eight cryptos to buy now. Let\u2019s explore each of them.Our top pick for the best crypto to buy ahead of the next bull run is Bitcoin ETF Token . Typically, Bitcoin-related tokens perform well alongside the market leader. However, the newly launched presale Bitcoin ETF Token offers a one-of-a-kind use case and is closely tied to the widely anticipated Bitcoin ETF approvals.The project features multiple tools to reward holders as the Bitcoin ETFs are approved. The most hyped is its deflationary mechanism, which drives scarcity and fear of missing out (FOMO) into the project, potentially skyrocketing its price.Bitcoin ETF Token\u2019s burn mechanism is two-fold. First, it has allocated 25% of its total supply to be burned across five key Bitcoin ETF Milestones. Second, it features a 5% burn tax on transactions, which will be reduced by 1% at each milestone.It also boasts a staking mechanism which currently offers a 97% APY. Presale buyers can start staking and compounding their investment immediately, but they must be quick as the rewards decrease as more people stake tokens.The project also offers Bitcoin ETF alerts via its website, updating users on the latest industry news. This will help foster and retain an active and engaged community.Bitcoin ETF Token\u2019s presale is quickly nearing its $4.9 million hard cap after raising $2.7 million in one month. Meme Kombat is a revolutionary meme coin-cross GambleFi token, providing an innovative use case, robust tokenomics, and a position at the cusp of two of crypto's most prominent trends.The project enables users to gamble on AI-generated battles between meme coin characters. It boasts numerous game modes, massive community rewards, and traditional odds mechanics, making for a truly immersive gambling experience.Essentially, this use case adds a gamified meme coin allure to the exciting crypto casino trend, which has seen significant success recently.Users must wager with the $MK token, creating a steady and predictable demand stream to help the price grow.On the other hand, much of the supply will be locked up in the project\u2019s lucrative staking mechanism. Currently, stakers can garner a 333% APY, this will decrease as the staking pool grows, similar to Bitcoin ETF Token.Another massively bullish factor is the project\u2019s security. It features a doxxed team, with its founder\u2019s details available on its website. Furthermore, blockchain security firm Coinsult recently conducted a smart contract audit , which found the $MK token is secure and not at risk of hacks or exploits.Investors can buy the Meme Kombat presale for $0.225, but they must hurry because its price will rise in just over one day.Avalanche is a scalable and decentralised layer 1 blockchain boasting a vast ecosystem. The project focuses mainly on DeFi and crypto gaming, two of crypto's most promising use cases.The AVAX price has recently begun a solid upward trajectory, currently trading at $26.26 and up 25% this week. As such, it has fared as the best-performing top 10 crypto, ahead of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and others, indicating a growing bullish narrative around the project.Moreover, AVAX has surged over 100% this month, solidifying its current trajectory. That said, there remains significant room for growth in the bull run, with its market cap at less than $10 billion.Avalanche could climb significantly higher in the upcoming bull run because its ecosystem is arguably expanding faster than any other. The project has seen adoption from leading financial institutions like JP Morgan and Citi. Meanwhile, tier-one games like Shrapnel, Blitz, and Off The Grid are all building on the network.This is significantly bullish for the AVAX coin since it is used for staking and will be the primary currency to transfer value and pay network transaction fees, providing significant demand as adoption grows.After a meteoric rise to become the third largest meme coin in the recent bear market, Pepe suffered a drawn-out pullback, dropping from highs of $0.000004354 on 6 May to $0.0000006446 in October.However, a renewed excitement surrounding the project caused its price to spike and break its bearish trajectory. Pepe reached highs of $0.000001141 on 10 November and then underwent another almost month-long consolidation.Yet, in recent days, the price has broken its consolidation resistance trend line, catapulting it 40% this week and making it one of the top-performing meme coins.$PEPE is currently up 8.5% on the last day, priced at $0.000001534, and could continue to recover during the Bitcoin bull run.Taking a long-term outlook, Pepe holds tremendous upside potential. It has a $640 million market cap, providing room for almost 3x growth to its ATH. Meanwhile, it presents room for nearly 8x to catch Shiba Inu by market cap and almost 20x to Dogecoin,opening the door to monumental gains for Pepe.Alongside its price increase, Pepe\u2019s trading volume has also surged recently. Currently, it is at $490 million. This is higher than Shiba Inu\u2019s, which is currently at $466 million and not far behind Dogecoin\u2019s $1.2 billion, despite a significantly lower market cap. TG Casino is a pioneering new crypto casino offering anonymous and secure gambling directly from the Telegram application, as seen on sites like Techopedia and Rakeback.com.Launching on Telegram provides various usability advantages, like a simplified betting process, end-to-end encryption, and access to Telegram\u2019s one billion users.Meanwhile, the project is KYC-free, and users only need to connect their wallets to start. This makes the Casino seamless, providing a massive advantage over market leader Rollbit, which is criticised for its complex signup process.The $TGC token also provides numerous advantages to holders, like free rewards, access to exclusive games and rooms, 25% cashback on losses, up to 200% rakeback, and a 173% staking APY.This creates a notable demand source that will push up the $TGC price. Meanwhile, it also features a cutting-edge buyback mechanism, repurchasing $TGC tokens from the open market with a portion of the casino\u2019s revenue.It will burn 40% of tokens and allocate 60% to staking rewards, making $TGC deflationary while rewarding holders in line with the casino\u2019s success.These factors amount to significant price potential, as highlighted by esteemed influencer Eric Cryptoman, who said it could be a \u201ctop runner\u201d once it launches on exchanges.Investors can buy TG Casino at presale for $0.175 but must hurry as its price will rise shortly.Another presale crypto offering a revolutionary use case is Bitcoin Minetrix . The project has raised $4.9 million in two months, indicating tremendous community interest.Bitcoin Minetrix enables users to mine Bitcoin by staking $BTCMTX on its Ethereum-based platform. Users stake their $BTCMTX tokens for mining credits, which they can burn for cloud mining power.This process enables anyone to mine Bitcoin, a tremendously powerful use case - especially considering the upcoming Bitcoin halving and anticipated price hike it will incur.Since it is based on cloud mining, users do not require hardware or specialist knowledge, and there are no overhead costs. Moreover, its decentralised and transparent $BTCMTX token eradicates the risk of cloud mining scams.Another advantage is there are no space or noise constraints for the user.All these factors provide immense value to Bitcoin mining, potentially moving the industry toward mass adoption, and $BTCMTX could therefore benefit from the next Bitcoin bull run.Moreover, the $BTCMTX token is central to the operation, with users requiring it for staking. This equates to a significant demand stream. Meanwhile, supply will be scarce since tokens will be locked for staking, and rewards will be paid out in mining credits, not $BTCMTX.IOTA is a well-established cryptocurrency that was deemed an Ethereum\u2013competitor in the 2017 bull run. However, it seemingly lost steam in the last bull market as its price failed to create a new ATH.Nevertheless, IOTA has gathered significant momentum recently, up 75% this week, with a $900 million market cap and price of $0.304.That said, it retains tremendous room for growth, currently 94% from its December 2017 ATH of $5.69.This could be a good crypto to buy ahead of the next bull run because its recent pump indicates a growing interest and potential trend reversal. Meanwhile, its upside potential is vast and boasts robust fundamentals.IOTA aims to build an \u201cInternet of Things\u201d leveraging a unique network architecture called \u201cThe Tangle,\u201d which makes the network more scalable as more people use it.It will integrate real-world items into the blockchain, providing a fast and secure distributed network where data can flow seamlessly and securely.There are infinite potential use cases for the project. Some of the most talked about are supply chain management, digital identities, and a \u201cdigital twin,\u201d which tracks the lifecycle of a real-life object such as a car, helping reduce the risk of fraud in the used car market.While many other top cryptos have experienced massive bullish momentum in recent weeks, XRP has remained relatively stable, up roughly 30% since October.It is currently priced at $0.617, with a $33 billion market cap.Yet, the exciting thing about the current XRP price is that it is just 20% higher than before its landmark partial victory over the SEC in its lawsuit.The currency was ruled not a security by the court, providing an unprecedented degree of legal clarity not present in any other crypto. Immediately, XRP\u2019s price spiked to upwards of $0.8 but pulled back after the SEC appealed the court\u2019s decision.Nevertheless, the court denied the SEC\u2019s appeal, but the price did not react as expected. Instead, it has consolidated between $0.58 and $0.62 while the rest of the market has soared.Given XRP\u2019s growing regulatory certainty, compelling use case as a global bridge currency for digital payments, and its market-leading partnerships, its price could be gearing for a tremendous pump in the coming weeks.This is furthered by its recent inactivity, increasing its upside potential relative to other cryptos that have already pumped."

        "title": "Bitcoin Bull Run Beckons: Unleashing The Potential Of 2024 Halving On Prices - NewsBTC",
        "content": "In the context of the constantly changing and complex cryptocurrency industry, Bitcoin is currently facing a critical point in its trajectory, as it confronts a range of heightened price pressures that pose significant challenges.\n\nThe upcoming halving event in 2024 has generated significant anticipation, drawing attention to the complex interaction of various elements that contribute to the value and destiny of the subject in question.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value has increased by 75% so far this year despite having to deal with regulatory scrutiny and fraud. The leading crypto in terms of market cap and widespread adoption has shown surprising resilience in the face of US Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions against key exchanges like Binance.US and Coinbase.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Price Performance\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is trading around $29,411, up a meager 0.2% in the last day, but managed to gain a decent 1.4% in the last week, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. Bitcoin is currently showing a neutral stance in the market and facing resistance as it tries to surpass the key $29,600 mark.\n\nBitcoin price flashing green in all timeframes. Source: Coingecko\n\nIf there\u2019s a bullish breakout above $29,600, it could potentially open up the path for Bitcoin to reach the $30,200 level. The top coin has already reached the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, which is at $29,200.\n\nBitcoin reached a market cap of $572 billion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin\u2019s price could change in a big way if it can break through the support level of $30,200. This accomplishment could act as a catalyst and push the value of the coin into a new range, which is thought to be between $30,600 and $31,000.\n\nSuch a breakthrough could make the market more hopeful and boost investor trust, which could set the stage for more growth.\n\nThe critical zones to watch are $29,800 and $30,200. If Bitcoin\u2019s price moves below these levels, it could indicate a bearish trend for the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction\n\nMeanwhile, Cypherpunk figure Adam Back has bet on Bitcoin hitting six figures by March 2024. He made the wager on Twitter, predicting that Bitcoin will surpass $100,000 before the March 31, 2024 halving. The bet is with the Twitter user \u201cVikingo,\u201d with the winner receiving 1 million satoshis (0.01 Bitcoin).\n\nthe bet is on\ud83d\ude80: i bet #bitcoin reaches or exceeds $100k between now and halving (31st Mar 2024) with @vikingobitcoin9 1million sats to the winner. https://t.co/Ij7iPEYjQW pic.twitter.com/PNpAaZvl8F \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) August 5, 2023\n\nFor Bitcoin to meet this target, it needs a 243% increase in the next eight months. Before the previous halving in May 2020, Bitcoin saw a range-bound period without major gains. The most significant price surge occurred about six months post-halving, initiating a bullish market trend in November of that year.\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin Halving\n\nBitcoin halving refers to the occurrence where miners\u2019 rewards for validating blockchain transactions are halved. This event takes place roughly every 210,000 mined blocks, which translates to approximately every four years.\n\nIntroduced by Bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, in 2009, halvings serve the purpose of regulating asset supply. The mining reward reduces by half every 210,000 blocks, aligning with Nakamoto\u2019s original vision as outlined in the white paper. This mechanism ensures the controlled creation of Bitcoin and maintains incentives for miners.\n\nThe historical trend of halvings driving price escalation underscores the intricate interplay between scarcity, demand, and Bitcoin\u2019s valuation, accentuating the anticipation surrounding the forthcoming halving\u2019s influence on prices.\n\n(This site\u2019s content should not be construed as investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin and Ethereum Fees Rise By Over 50%: Will BTC Conquer $69k? - NewsBTC",
        "content": "There is a spike in crypto on-chain activity if transaction fees lead. According to IntoTheBlock data on December 8, Bitcoin transaction fees are up by over 60%, while \u201cgas\u201d in Ethereum has climbed by nearly 50% in the past week.\n\nBitcoin And Ethereum Transaction Fees Rise By Double-Digits\n\nThis surge in activity can be pinned to multiple factors, mainly growing user interest and the ongoing crypto bull market. To illustrate, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are trending at 2023 highs above $43,500 and $2,300 when writing.\n\nEven so, the crypto community expects these coins to extend gains in the coming weeks and months, partly because of expected institutional capital, projected to be in their billions, flowing to the sphere.\n\nAccording to IntoTheBlock data, cumulative fees collected in Bitcoin this week stand at $43.8 million, up 61%. On the other hand, $83.3 million in fees has been accrued from Ethereum.\n\nLooking at the historical transaction fees trend, transacting on Ethereum, despite its relatively high transaction processing speeds (TPS), is more expensive than Bitcoin. This can be due to Ethereum\u2019s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible token (NFT) minting, and more. Bitcoin is a transactional layer and doesn\u2019t inherently support smart contracts.\n\nUsually, rising on-chain transaction fees are bullish for price and indicate that their respective ecosystem is thriving from increasing adoption. With transaction fees rising in the two leading blockchain ecosystems, more people want to interact with the project. Subsequently, this could support prices since BTC or ETH is used for paying transaction fees.\n\nWill BTC Ease Past 2021 Highs Of $70,000?\n\nAs BTC is currently trading above $43,500 and ETH recently broke above $2,300, the possibility of these coins retesting and easing past their all-time highs of $70,000 and $4,800, respectively, cannot be discounted. One of the key drivers of the surge in on-chain activity is the ongoing bull market.\n\nWith crypto rising, more people are looking to position themselves, hoping to profit from further price appreciation. This wave of fear of missing out (FOMO) has pushed higher fees and prices.\n\nThe demand for liquid and SEC-recognized digital assets will likely increase once the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) goes ahead and authorizes the first Bitcoin ETF. This derivative product will allow institutions to invest in Bitcoin confidently through a regulated solution.\n\nAs the odds of the SEC approving this product rose from early Q4 2023, BTC and ETH prices started rising in sync. Still, how prices will react once the spot Bitcoin ETF is approved remains to be seen. Once the SEC green-lights a spot Bitcoin ETF, the crypto market will begin looking at Ethereum and whether the agency will approve a similar solution.\n\nFeature image from Canva, chart from TradingView\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "The so-called bitcoin halving reduces the number of tokens that bitcoin miners receive to help cap supply at 21 million tokens. In each of the last three events, the coin hit a record.\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, cryptocurrency markets recorded a total market value of $US1.6 trillion ($2.4 trillion) on Friday, with bitcoin reaching a market cap of $US847.2 billion on a 24-hour trading volume of $US27.7 billion.\n\nThe oldest cryptocurrency has now rocketed 175 per cent in 2023 and is on track to be the best-performing major asset this year, thumping the returns on traditional assets such as stocks, gold and bonds.\n\nThe renewed appetite has been largely attributed to expectations the US Securities Exchange Commission will approve a bitcoin ETF in January, which will pave the way for Wall Street players such as BlackRock and Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest to market the funds to massive swaths of new investors.\n\nDumping Binance\n\nCaroline Bowler, chief executive of ASIC-regulated exchange BTC Markets, said Binance customers had withdrawn more than $US2.3 billion from the troubled exchange in seven days after the founder pleaded guilty to US charges that included allowing transactions with terrorist group Hamas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Zhao\u2019s guilty plea also followed the conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO of now collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, in a high-profile trial in October.\n\nBTC Markets CEO Caroline Bowler said the exchange trousered $6.5 million of inflows just from Binance clients in the week following its November 21 plea deal. Oscar Colman\n\nMs Bowler said BTC pocketed $6.5 million of inflows from Binance users alone between November 21 to November 28, with total crypto inflows to the exchange soaring 122 per cent on the prior comparable week in 2022.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t happy about what they heard from Binance,\u201d said Ms Bowler. \u201cThe Australian exchanges are now viewed by Australian investors as a flight to safety in times of uncertainty. We saw inflows in May of last year when Terra Luna collapsed and people are cautious after what happened with FTX.\u201d\n\nShe added that the federal government\u2019s proposal for cryptocurrency exchanges to obtain an Australian Financial Services License could make the sector more appealing to institutional investors and foster mainstream adoption.\n\nMs Bowler said the strong inflows had extended into December to elongate a steady upswing in crypto trading volumes and markets after a horror end to 2022, bookmarked by the collapse of FTX."
