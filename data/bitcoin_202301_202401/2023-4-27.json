        "content": "The 3,000-resident Salvadoran village of El Zonte was once a sleepy beach town. But it\u2019s quickly being transformed into a major surfing hot spot.\n\nKids play in the sand. Tourists watch the surfers out at the shoreline break. A woman sells drinks out of a little wooden shack.\n\nAlong a two-block sandy strip, there are lines of homegrown restaurants and new upscale hotels. One prominent feature on many signs is a big letter \u201cB\u201d and the words, \u201cWe accept bitcoin.\"\n\nBitcoin \u2014 the increasingly popular cryptocurrency \u2014 got its start in El Zonte, El Salvador.\n\nPeople at Bitcoin Beach in El Zonte, El Salvador. Credit: Michael Fox/The World\n\n\"Yes, I am very proud,\u201d said Reina Isabel, the owner of a corner store in town. \"This is Bitcoin Beach and bitcoin grew from here.\"\n\nBitcoin Beach was founded in 2019 by US surfer and entrepreneur Mike Peterson, who received a donation from a wealthy benefactor wanting to create a circular bitcoin economy in the coastal village. So, they started to pay local residents in bitcoins for local jobs.\n\nSalvadorans have become wary of accepting bitcoin as the value of the cryptocurrency fluctuates, El Zonte, El Salvador. Credit: Michael Fox/The World\n\nThe endeavor caught the attention of President Nayib Bukele, who soon became one of the greatest champions of the cryptocurrency, and El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt it as a legal tender.\n\n\"This is a law to benefit the population,\u201d Bukele told Salvadorans, when he announced the new Bitcoin Law in 2021. \"This is a law that puts us in the eyes of the world for something new and innovative. It\u2019s a law that only benefits and causes no harm.\u201d\n\nA volatile currency\n\nThere are more than 200 bitcoin ATMs across the country where people can pull out the equivalent of US dollars from their bitcoin accounts. And many Salvadorans have benefitted from the new currency. The whole idea behind bitcoin was to create a means for people to save and exchange currency outside of traditional financial systems \u2014 and hopefully, make money on the rising exchange.\n\nBut the bitcoin seas have been choppy.\n\nThe problem is its volatility. The cryptocurrency lost more than half its value in the first year of becoming legal tender in El Salvador. Today, it\u2019s still trading at 40% less than when it launched on September 7, 2021.\n\nRestaurants and new upscale hotels have cropped up along the sandy strip of Bitcoin Beach, El Zonte, El Salvador. Credit: Michael Fox/The World\n\nPeople with a lot of capital can wait it out, but that's harder for those who rely on it for their daily income.\n\nAs a result, even at Bitcoin Beach, many people say they won\u2019t take it.\n\n\u201cIt's up and down and if you pay me in bitcoin, I\u2019ve got to go right at the moment to turn the bitcoin into dollars,\u201d shop owner Marlin Flores said. He grew up in Texas, and now runs a store just off the beach.\n\n\"If I don't, it could fluctuate. It could drop.\u201d\n\nRestaurant owner Narcisa Lopez agreed.\n\nBitcoin Beach was founded in 2019 by US surfer and entrepreneur Mike Peterson, who received a donation from a wealthy benefactor wanting to create a circular bitcoin economy in the coastal village. So, they started to pay local residents in bitcoins for local jobs. Credit: Michael Fox/The World\n\n\"I don\u2019t use it or accept it,\u201d she said. \"I feel like they are trying to steal from us. They say that its value rises and falls and it\u2019s really hard for those of us who don\u2019t know much about technology.\u201d\n\nLopez said that only five people have asked her if she accepts bitcoin since she opened late last year. And that a close friend of hers lost thousands of dollars by investing in the cryptocurrency.\n\nShe said it reminds her of when the country dollarized the economy in 2001, dumping the national currency, the col\u00f3n.\n\n\"They told us everything would improve with the dollar,\u201d she said, \u201cbut now everything\u2019s just more expensive.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Beach was founded in 2019 by US surfer and entrepreneur Mike Peterson, El Zonte, El Salvador. Credit: Michael Fox/The World\n\nForeign investments\n\nOne group that has enthusiastically embraced El Salvador\u2019s bitcoin experiment is foreign cryptocurrency activists. They were behind Bitcoin Beach and they\u2019ve been selling El Salvador as a destination for wealthy expats to invest in, visit and live.\n\nThere\u2019s even a Bitcoin Beach podcast, hosted by founder Mike Peterson.\n\n\u201cWe are live from Bitcoin Beach, the bitcoin center of the world here in El Salvador and we are very excited to showcase the amazing things that are transpiring in this country,\u201d he said in the first episode published five months ago called, \u201cThis is why we are here.\u201d\n\nHe even emphasized at a recent bitcoin conference in France that \"it\u2019s going to be places like El Salvador that will drive bitcoin forward.\u201d\n\nHe may have the support of people like Bukele, but many Salvadorans fear they might not be able to catch the wave.\n\nRelated: \u2018It\u2019s a casino operation\u2019: As Turkish lira falls, some Turks turn to cryptocurrency"

It's been clear for years now that bitcoin is a commodity and not a security. Even the ultra-active current Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has been the most active and aggressive chairman I've seen in my professional career, admits that there is only one crypto asset that is clearly a commodity (and, by implication, not a security). He obviously means bitcoin. With or without him, the SEC will likely continue to pursue actions that imply the vast majority of digital assets are securities. None of this risk sticks to bitcoin."

        "content": "Cryptocurrency's most famous coin \u2014 Bitcoin \u2014 has been a big newsmaker recently, some good and some bad. It's still very new and relatively unknown. There's a lot of questions about cryptocurrency and debate about protection.\n\n\u201cMy opinion is that this is probably the biggest value driver that I've seen in my lifetime outside of the internet,\u201d said Jeremy Knopp, principal of CryptoHedge, a private hedge fund dealing in cryptocurrency, who helps institutions and accredited investors navigate this new world.\n\nOut of college, Knopp became fascinated with the idea of cryptocurrency and crypto assets, that it became his life.\n\n\u201cI fell in love with the technology side, as well as the investment capabilities,\u201d he added. \u201cI think there's a lot of people that don't know where to start, frankly, because the information is overwhelming.\u201d\n\nHis father-in-law, Doug DeMarche, is like many Americans. Maybe his neighbor or his friend made some money in Bitcoin, but other than that, he doesn't know much about it.\n\nSo DeMarche, who wants to get started in investing, is seeking Knopp's help.\n\n\u201cI think most people now realize the growth potential and the asymmetric upside risk. You know, there's also a lot of noise out there,\u201d Knopp said.\n\nSo Knopp suggests people start from the beginning and learn the basics. Think of it like a digital gold, he said. He believes most people have probably heard of a few of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Etherium, Dogecoin and, of course, Bitcoin.\n\nThey are digital coins that exist only online. They can be traded like a stock, and in some cases, can be used to make real-life purchases.\n\n\u201cThere has been, literally, no better investment that you could have made from 2009 to 2022 than Bitcoin,\u201d Knopp said.\n\nWhen you buy Bitcoin or any other crypto, you are actually buying a digital code that exists only on the Bitcoin blockchain. You access this code through a private key to a digital wallet that only you hold.\n\n\u201cI see blockchain technology and, you know, this kind of disintermediation of value as being that next wave of technology,\u201d he added.\n\nThe technology is known as blockchain, in essence, a digital accounting book, or ledger. Blockchain is an open source, decentralized, shared-with-everyone, digital ledger. It records transactions and tracks assets 24/7 and in real time. It is tamper-resistant, while also removing the nodes, the middlemen that we often see in finance and business, reducing the risk of foul play and fraud and also cutting the costs, the fees of that middleman.\n\nMany people who don\u2019t mine, use nodes \u2014 a third party \u2014 to acquire the coin.\n\n\u201cIt provides a lot of efficiency. It provides a lot of technological capability outside of what exists today,\u201d Knopp added.\n\nEfficiency that is now disrupting banking and finance, gaming and even music.\n\nCanadian rock band Our Lady Peace, who recently performed a private show in Syracuse, released its latest album as an NFT, a non-fungible token, a digital asset that allowed the band to skip the traditional record label, make the music it wanted to and sell the album \u2014 and extras \u2014 directly to fans and not pay the label fees.\n\n\u201cSo you remove all those middle layers, which has always been a hindrance to creators in terms of distributing, monetizing but also community-building,\u201d Our Lady Peace lead singer Raine Maida said, adding the blockchains ability to track asset transactions, allows creators to earn royalties every time an NFT or other creation on the chain sells from fan to fan.\n\n\u201cEspecially from new artists that are kind of unproven and trying to make a name for themselves. They have to accept terms that are not very advantageous for them,\u201d Knopp added.\n\nThat is what he means when he says changing the game.\n\nBut for as much as some love the idea of what crypto can be, others are not as certain. In the third part of this series, Spectrum News 1 takes a look at the questions many have, the scandals that have sprouted and the balance between a decentralized concept and a possible need for government regulation."

        "content": "Francesco Carta Fotografo | Moment | Getty Images\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrency like bitcoin , new investors are often motivated by friends to take the plunge, according to a new study. But that might hold traps for the unwary, experts warn. \"I don't imagine friends are talking about when they lost money,\" said Lee Baker, a certified financial planner and founder of Apex Financial Services in Atlanta. \"The sexy sells,\" added Baker, a member of CNBC's Advisor Council. \"The upside sells. \"But folks don't talk about the downside,\" he added.\n\nNearly a third \u2014 31% \u2014 of new cryptocurrency investors in 2022 used a friend's suggestion as their primary reason for buying in, according to a recent joint study published by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Investor Education Foundation and NORC at the University of Chicago. Friends' recommendations were the No. 1 motivating factor for new crypto buyers. That share compares with 8% of new investors in more traditional assets like stocks and bonds. The disparity indicates there is \"a social element to cryptocurrency investing not evident in equities or bond investing,\" according to the study. This isn't to say a friend's recommendation is necessarily a poor reason to buy into the digital assets.\n\nwatch now\n\nBut it can be a \"double-edged sword,\" said Gary Mottola, research director at the FINRA Investor Education Foundation and a co-author of the report. On one hand, crypto can be an on-ramp to more traditional investing \u2014 which is generally a good outcome, Mottola said. There's some evidence of this happening: 36% of new crypto investors said their purchase made them more interested in investing in the stock market, the study found. However, \"the friends recommending [crypto], the sources of information on social media, may not be reliable,\" Mottola said.\n\nTrust but verify\n\nThe fear of missing out can be a powerful driver of investment decisions. Bitcoin and other crypto assets rallied through 2021, a record year for the digital assets. Bitcoin jumped from roughly $10,000 in the summer of 2020 to a peak above $68,000 by November 2021. But the tide turned quickly during a so-called \"crypto winter,\" when investors lost more than $2 trillion in the year following the market peak.\n\nThe sexy sells. The upside sells. But folks don't talk about the downside. Lee Baker CFP and founder of Apex Financial Services\n\nCelebrities, like actress Lindsay Lohan and the rapper Soulja Boy, were recently fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for undisclosed endorsements of various cryptocurrencies. \"Unless they're some legitimately knowledgeable financial person, trust but verify,\" Baker said of information you may hear from friends or from \"pseudo experts\" on social media. One of the dangers of following a friend's advice: Investors may not understand the risks and volatility associated with crypto (or other investments), or how it fits within a broader, well-diversified investment portfolio, he said."

        "content": "Venmo soon will allow users to transfer their Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash to outside wallets\u2014as well as to other users of the popular payment app.\n\nThe feature will roll out starting in May, according to a statement from PayPal, which acquired Venmo in 2013. Users can also transfer crypto to their wallets at PayPal, which released a similar ability in 2022.\n\nCrypto transfers on Venmo will be irreversible, just like crypto transactions more broadly\u2014a function of cryptocurrency\u2019s use of blockchains, or immutable public ledgers. To roll out the transfer system, PayPal is partnering with Paxos, a crypto firm that specializes in stablecoins.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to connect Venmo\u2019s customers to the community, other wallets and exchanges, and we intend to continue to roll out additional crypto products and services in the year ahead,\u201d PayPal said in its statement.\n\nThe announcement from PayPal is one of the first drips of crypto updates from the payments giant since February, when it was reported that the publicly traded company was pausing work on its own stablecoin after reports that Paxos, its partner in the effort, was under investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services, a key player among U.S. cryptocurrency regulators.\n\nAt the time, a spokesperson for PayPal told Fortune that the company was \u201cexploring a stablecoin\u201d and that if and when the payments giant moves forward, it will \u201cwork closely with relevant regulators.\u201d\n\nBefore the onset of Crypto Winter and the recent regulatory crackdown on the industry, PayPal was one of the more public crypto boosters among legacy fintech firms.\n\nIn October 2020, the company announced that U.S. users of PayPal would be able to buy, hold, and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. One year later, the payments giant expanded the feature to Venmo customers.\n\nAmid the crypto bull market of 2021, PayPal continued to build out crypto offerings. It let users pay merchants with cryptocurrency, partnered with Coinbase to allow those with PayPal-linked debit cards and bank accounts to buy tokens on the exchange, and expanded its crypto service beyond the U.S. to other countries, including the U.K.\n\nAfter the collapse of several prominent crypto firms in 2022, PayPal noticeably rolled back its public rhetoric on cryptocurrencies. In February, longtime CEO Dan Schulman announced his intention to step down at the end of 2023.\n\nUpdate, April 28, 2023: This article has been updated to show that Paxos is partnering with PayPal to enable crypto transfers on Venmo."

        "content": "The United States government is one of the most significant Bitcoin (BTC) holders in the world, holding 205,514 BTC \u2014 worth $6 billion \u2014 according to Glassnode data.\n\nReflexivity Research co-founder Will Clemente noted that the U.S. government acquired its BTC through seizures.\n\nFor context, the U.S. Department of Justice seized $3.6 billion worth of Bitcoin connected to the 2016 Bitfinex hack last year. Before that, the government took 70,000 BTC from Ross Ulbricht when it brought down the Silk Road.\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s substantial BTC holding places it ahead of whales like MicroStrategy \u2014 which has spent over $4 billion to acquire 140,000 units of the flagship digital asset.\n\nMeanwhile, the largest BTC holder is the pseudonymous creator of the blockchain network, Satoshi Nakamoto, with 1 million BTC. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust follows him with 650,000 BTC. Others on the list include exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Bitfinex.\n\nWhat would the US government do with its BTC?\n\nJudging by its precedence, the U.S. government would likely sell off the digital assets in the next few years.\n\nIn March, the U.S. government filed a memo in the Southern District of New York showing it sold 9,861.17 BTC for $215.5 million. The memo revealed that the sold BTC was part of the assets it seized from the Silk Road marketplace.\n\nThe court filing further hinted that the government would still sell more BTC before the end of the year. Earlier this week, rumors emerged that the government was selling part of these assets.\n\nMeanwhile, many industry players have criticized the government\u2019s penchant for selling, pointing out that it could have made more money by holding. For instance, the U.S. government sold 29,657 Bitcoin for about $18 million in 2014. Today, the same asset would be worth almost $900 million.\n\nFeatured Data Partner\n\nMentioned in this article"

        "content": "Join the most important conversation in crypto and web3! Secure your seat today\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has historically moved in the opposite direction of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, including the euro.\n\nThe negative correlation has strengthened, reversing the brief let-up witnessed in late March, and indicating the possibility of accelerated gains in the cryptocurrency in the case of a continued dollar slide following the release of the U.S. gross domestic product data on Thursday.\n\nThe 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the dollar index has slipped to a two-month low of -0.70, according to data from charting platform TradingView. It had weakened to -0.11 four weeks ago.\n\nCorrelations are measured on a scale of -1 to +1. Values skewed toward -1 indicate that lower prices for one variable are associated with higher prices for the other.\n\nThe 90-day correlation coefficient of -0.70 suggests a notably strong negative relationship between the two assets. (TradingView/CoinDesk)\n\nBitcoin and the DXY have been mostly negatively correlated over the past three years, except in times where crypto-specific factors overshadowed the dollar trends. For instance, bitcoin fell in late 2022 as the collapse of crypto exchange FTX kept investors from cheering weakness in the U.S. currency. A similar breakdown was seen in the lead-up to Coinbase's (COIN) Nasdaq debut in April 2021 and the launch of a futures-based exchange-traded fund in the U.S. the following October.\n\nFocus on GDP\n\nAt 12:30 UTC, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its preliminary estimate of first-quarter GDP. The data is likely to show the world's largest economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.0%, a slower pace than the 2.6% growth in the fourth quarter last year, according to Reuters estimates published by FXStreet.\n\nSeveral economic indicators and bond market metrics have been warning of a recession for months. The dollar index has declined by over 12% since early October in the hopes that the Federal Reserve would halt its interest-rate hikes and resort to liquidity easing to support the economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nBesides, traders are back to pricing three interest-rate cuts by year end in the wake of issues at First Republic Bank (FRC), even though the Fed didn't cut rates and maintained a hawkish or anti-stimulus bias following the banking crisis episode of March.\n\nWith so much dovish expectations already in the air, the GDP figure might have to indicate a sharper-than-expected moderation in economic activity to trigger a deeper dollar sell-off and rally in risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt also means that a upbeat figure may see markets price out rate cuts and lift the dollar higher.\n\n\"The market eyes growth at 2% \u2013 shouldn't move markets too intently given the backward nature of the data point \u2013 would need to be a big beat/miss to the move rates expectations and the USD, gold, Nasdaq,\" Chris Weston, head of research at foreign-exchange brokerage Pepperstone, said in a tweet.\n\nAt press time, bitcoin was changing hands at $29,010, up 2% in the past 24 hours. The dollar index was little changed at 101.50."

        "title": "Better Buy: Ethereum or Bitcoin? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite a recent pullback in the crypto market, both Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) continue to be two of the best-performing cryptos. Bitcoin is up about 80% for the year, while Ethereum is up about 60%. On the surface, it would appear that Bitcoin is clearly the superior investment in 2023.\n\nHowever, two market indicators paint a different picture of what's happening in the crypto market right now. Here's a closer look at how Ethereum stacks up with Bitcoin on a relative basis.\n\nBitcoin's correlation with Ethereum\n\nCorrelations are incredibly important in the crypto markets. For example, any time the correlation of Bitcoin with gold tightens, it usually signals that investors are about to pile into Bitcoin as a safe-haven investment. Investors also use the correlation of Bitcoin with broad market indexes such as the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq 100 to gauge how the market currently views crypto as a risky asset. The tighter the correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq, the thinking goes, the more that investors are viewing Bitcoin as just a slightly riskier tech stock.\n\nBut there's another correlation that many investors are not talking about, and that's the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum. The conventional wisdom is that the correlation between the two is very close to 1.0, so it's not really worth tracking. However, Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) made waves earlier this month when it published a report showing how the correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum appears to be declining, from a level of 0.95 in mid-March to a level of 0.82 in mid-April. That might not seem like a big deal, but it is for institutional investors. It directly impacts risk management and sophisticated hedging techniques.\n\nThere are a number of different factors that might be responsible for this shift, including Ethereum's recent tech upgrade in March. If this trend persists, it could signal that Ethereum is finally uncoupling from Bitcoin and going its own way. That would be a net positive for Ethereum because it would fundamentally challenge the simplistic \"Bitcoin is gold, Ethereum is silver\" investment narrative.\n\nThe Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair\n\nSince both Bitcoin and Ethereum are digital currencies, it makes sense to evaluate them from the perspective of a foreign exchange trader. One way of doing this is by tracking the performance of the Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair over time. By doing so, you can immediately see when Ethereum is \"strengthening\" against Bitcoin and when it is \"weakening\" against Bitcoin. In much the same way, a foreign exchange trader could see when the U.S. dollar is strengthening or weakening against the Euro (or some other currency).\n\nData by Trading View\n\nAs can be seen from the chart above, the current value of the Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair is approximately 0.066. This is derived from dividing the current price of Ethereum ($1,915) by the current price of Bitcoin ($28,964). The value of the Ethereum/Bitcoin currency pair has traded, by and large, in a relatively narrow range of 0.06 to 0.08 since mid-2021. From a historical perspective, this value is actually quite high. In the period from 2019 to 2021, for example, the value typically ranged from 0.02 to 0.03. The big breakout came during the last crypto bull market rally when the number of possible use cases for Ethereum exploded. On the graph, it's possible to see a huge spike right around March 2021.\n\nPutting all this together, it's possible to create an investment thesis around Ethereum and Bitcoin. Ever since 2021, Ethereum seems to be gaining in value on a relative basis vs. Bitcoin. Another way to think about this is that as Ethereum continues to introduce new technological upgrades and expand its ecosystem, it is \"strengthening\" against Bitcoin and becoming a better investment. If you think about the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem as an economy, then this becomes intuitively clear. In the same way, one would expect the U.S. dollar to strengthen if the U.S. economy strengthens.\n\nDoes the data favor Ethereum?\n\nOverall, a case can be made that Ethereum is not just a better investment than Bitcoin right now, but that it's also becoming a better investment over time. Ethereum clearly has a more diversified blockchain ecosystem than Bitcoin and offers a whole range of products and offerings -- such as NFTs, blockchain gaming, metaverse worlds, and decentralized finance (DeFi) -- that Bitcoin simply can't match. Bitcoin is, first and foremost, a method of payment.\n\nThus, if you're a Bitcoin maximalist, you might want to take a closer look at the changing relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Right now, it looks like Ethereum after The Merge is stronger, better, and more diversified than it has ever been, and investors are starting to recognize this. At some point, say some crypto investors, Ethereum could eventually \"flip\" Bitcoin and become the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world."

        "content": "How Jack Dorsey\u2019s Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is fighting for the future of open source software It's not just the Bitcoin community that should be concerned\n\nA crypto wallet theft lawsuit brought about by a man who claims to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto could jeopardize the future of open source software development.\n\nThat\u2019s according to the Jack Dorsey-backed Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, which is taking on a case to defend 11 Bitcoin developers named in a lawsuit filed by Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist who emerged into the spotlight back in 2016 with a hotly disputed claim of being Bitcoin\u2019s founding father.\n\nThe crux of the case in question dates back to 2021 when Wright, through a Seychelles-based firm called Tulip Trading, launched a so-called \u201cletter before action\u201d against 16 Bitcoin software developers, in an attempt to regain access to \u00a34 billion ($5 billion) worth of Bitcoin he claims to own. Wright said that he lost access to private keys for 111,000 Bitcoins after his home network was hacked the previous year, and that it was the responsibility of key Bitcoin Core (the main version of the Bitcoin protocol software) developers to remedy illegitimate crypto transactions.\n\nAlthough the case was initially dismissed last year before it made it to court, a U.K. appeals court reversed that decision back in March, allowing the case to proceed with a trial expected some time in 2024. In his findings, Lord Justice Birss pointed to academic literature that questions whether public blockchains really are decentralized.\n\n\u201cIf the decentralized governance of Bitcoin really is a myth, then in my judgment there is much to be said for the submission that bitcoin developers, while acting as developers, owe fiduciary duties to the true owners of that property,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSo on Wednesday this week, 11 Bitcoin developers filed their defense with support from the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, a not-for-profit set up in 2021 by Twitter and Block (formerly Square) co-founder Jack Dorsey, Block\u2019s head of litigation Martin White and Chaincode Labs co-founder Alex Morcos. The fund now also includes chief legal officer Jess Jonas, who joined in January.\n\n\u201cMulti-front litigation\u201d\n\nThe fund\u2019s founders initially penned an open letter to Bitcoin developers last year to explain their raison d\u2019\u00eatre. They pointed to the \u201cmulti-front litigation\u201d that the Bitcoin community faces, including Craig Wright\u2019s efforts which they confirmed at the time it would be leading the defense for. While they noted that the main purpose of the fund was to defend developers \u201cfrom lawsuits regarding their activities in the Bitcoin ecosystem,\u201d they also noted that the ramifications extended far deeper into the broader open source realm.\n\n\u201cLitigation and continued threats are having their intended effect \u2014 individual defendants have chosen to capitulate in the absence of legal support,\u201d the trio wrote. \u201cOpen source developers, who are often independent, are especially susceptible to legal pressure. In response, we propose a coordinated and formalized response to help defend developers.\u201d\n\nA familiar story\n\nIn truth, the issue of the legal system interfering with open source software development has become a hot topic of late. In a letter to EU authorities last week, more than a dozen open source industry bodies said that the newly proposed Cyber Resilience Act, which seeks to codify cybersecurity practices for digital products sold in Europe, may have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on software development, as open source developers could be held personally liable for security slip-ups that happen in a downstream product. In other words, if the Act is to pass in its current form, developers might be less inclined to contribute to open source projects for fear of legal wrangles.\n\nElsewhere, some argue that the EU\u2019s upcoming AI Act, which seeks to govern AI applications based on perceived risks, could create burdensome legal liability for open source developers working on general purpose AI systems (GPAI), and give greater power to well-financed big tech companies.\n\nWhile the latest episode to emerge around Bitcoin is somewhat different, it gives rise to similar issues. The overarching story may well be about who does or doesn\u2019t get to control Bitcoin, and whether the project\u2019s core developer base should be forced to create some sort of \u201cback door\u201d to serve third-party access to private keys. But bubbling under the surface is something that\u2019s fundamental to the future of software, and whether open source developers should have a fiduciary duty to their users.\n\n\u201cWe believe that these lawsuits are frivolous, but we still have to oppose them vigorously,\u201d Jonas said in a statement.\n\nLegal responsibility\n\nPivotal to the defendants\u2019 case is the simple fact that Bitcoin was released under an open source MIT License, which bestows little in the way of any legal responsibility on those maintaining the software. The MIT License explicitly states:\n\nIn no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\nBut if, for whatever reason, a court was to rule on the side of Tulip Trading, this could effectively destroy one of the core tenets of the MIT License that underpins countless open source projects today, setting a dangerous precedent that compels open source developers \u2014 many of whom work in their own time on their own dime \u2014 to serve the end-user of that software, no matter what their demands.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund fights not just for Bitcoin but for the right of open-source developers to create and freely share their code with the world for the greater good,\u201d Morcos said in a separate statement. \u201cThe Tulip Trading case threatens not only the MIT License but also the very notion of freedom of speech. Our collective mission is to safeguard innovation by shielding developers from legal intimidation.\u201d\n\nWhile there are 16 defendants in total, the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is only representing 11 developers who worked on Bitcoin Core. There is a 12th Bitcoin Core defendant who has not sought help from the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, plus a further four defendants that have worked on various Bitcoin forks who are arranging their own counsel.\n\nSeparately, Wright has initiated a secondary case against other Bitcoin developer entities, with Wright claiming ownership of Bitcoin copyright and database rights on the basis that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. This case was thrown out back in February, but the lawsuit quickly reemerged in a revised form with the defendants filing their defense last month. The Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund is supporting two Bitcoin Core developers named in that lawsuit too.\n\n\u201cThe outcomes of these cases are important for everyone, even those who may not be interested in Bitcoin, because these lawsuits could have serious detrimental effects on open-source development writ large, which will negatively impact our lives in ways we may not even realize until it\u2019s too late,\u201d Dorsey added in a statement."

        "title": "What Pullback? Bitcoin Can Still Hit $100,000 - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Year to date, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is up 78%, and that's after a minor pullback that saw it lose nearly 10% of its value after briefly touching the $30,000 level for the first time in nearly 10 months. At the same time, Bitcoin continues to outperform just about every other major cryptocurrency.\n\nBut just how much higher can Bitcoin go? In mid-April, Standard Chartered Bank issued a new price target of $100,000 for Bitcoin for year-end 2024. At current prices, that would suggest a monster rally that sees Bitcoin more than triple in value in less than 20 months. So let's dive into some of the assumptions used to create that $100,000 price target.\n\nThe case for Bitcoin at $100,000\n\nA big reason Bitcoin might explode in value has to do with the current macroeconomic environment. According to Standard Chartered Bank, the \"crypto winter\" is officially over now, and people can go back to investing in crypto. Moreover, if you buy into the assumption that the Federal Reserve has finished tightening and will now leave interest rates alone or even cut them before too long, then that is obviously going to be a huge positive for the entire crypto market. Risk assets such as Bitcoin tend to flourish when rates are low or declining.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin is regaining its status as a \"safe haven\" asset that people put their money into when things look dicey in the broader economy. After the first stage of the banking crisis involving Silicon Valley Bank, some people rushed to take their money out of traditional banks and put it into Bitcoin, which they perceived as being a superior store of value. The same thing seems to be happening now with First Republic Bank (FRCB), with Bitcoin suddenly increasing in value after a brief pullback.\n\nBut can Bitcoin triple in value?\n\nOK, that all sounds great, but is it really enough to propel Bitcoin to $100,000? Keep in mind that the all-time high for Bitcoin is $68,789.63. So not only is Bitcoin going to face a tremendous amount of resistance fighting through the $40,000 level, the $50,000 level, and the $60,000 level, but it's also going to face an epic battle hitting a new all-time high at the $70,000 level. We've already seen a foreshadowing of this with Bitcoin at $30,000, when it immediately pulled back.\n\nI think the market is going to need a huge new catalyst to propel Bitcoin to stratospheric new heights. Standard Chartered Bank mentioned a few other factors that might help Bitcoin -- such as the increasing profitability of Bitcoin miners -- but all of these seem like minor, technical factors rather than big breakthrough catalysts.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving\n\nHowever, one factor that Standard Chartered Bank alluded to might just be big enough to propel Bitcoin to $100,000. This is an event known as the Bitcoin halving, and it takes place only once every four years. The next Bitcoin halving takes place in 2024 and is already being talked up in crypto circles as a huge opportunity for Bitcoin investors.\n\nIn a halving event, the reward for mining a block of Bitcoin falls by half. Right now, miners get 6.25 Bitcoins every time they add a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, in April 2024, that reward will fall to 3.125 Bitcoins. That might not sound like a big deal, but it actually has huge implications for how Bitcoin trades. After each halving, Bitcoin becomes more scarce and more deflationary. Both of these factors, theoretically, should boost its value.\n\nAnd, indeed, in past halving cycles, the results have been dramatic. Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital has modeled past Bitcoin halving cycles and found that Bitcoin tends to rise in value in the 477 days prior to the halving and then explode in value afterward. As a result, back in November, Pantera thought Bitcoin could hit $36,000 by early 2024 and then skyrocket to $149,000.\n\nCaveats\n\nJust remember that past performance is no guarantee of future performance. And the impact of each Bitcoin halving cycle appears to be diminishing, so it might not be realistic to expect the same types of gains that we saw in 2012, 2016, or 2020. And, finally, it's worth noting that Standard Chartered Bank actually predicted in December that Bitcoin might crash to the $5,000 level in 2023, so it's safe to say that nobody really knows what Bitcoin will do this year.\n\nBut if you're looking for a reason why Bitcoin might hit the $100,000 mark in 2024, I think it has to be the next Bitcoin halving cycle. Fed easing is going to make it more likely that Bitcoin gets initial lift-off. A better overall macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. economy could reduce friction enough for Bitcoin to hit escape velocity. But for Bitcoin to skyrocket to the moon, it is going to need the fuel provided by the halving. As we near the midway point of 2023, look for discussion of this factor to dominate any future predictions of Bitcoin price performance in 2024."

        "title": "7 Best Advantages Of Decentralized Currencies Like Bitcoin - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Do you know about Bitcoin and other cryptos that operate without a central authority? They provide advantages over conventional, centralized currencies. We\u2019ll look at the seven main benefits of Bitcoin and similar decentralized currencies to see why they\u2019re gaining popularity. Let\u2019s get started, so make yourself a cup of coffee.\n\nWhy Are Decentralized Currencies Gaining Popularity?\n\nBitcoin and other decentralized currencies are gaining popularity because of their many benefits over controlled currencies. The high level of protection and privacy it provides is a significant selling point. Using a decentralized currency allows for transactions to be documented on an unchangeable and publicly shared database called a blockchain. This eliminates the need to provide private information during a transaction, lowering the potential for fraud.\n\nDecentralized currencies save the time and cost of using intermediaries, allowing for quicker and cheaper transaction processing. They are more trustworthy since a single entity does not manage them. The transaction costs are often more affordable than conventional money\n\nDecentralized currencies are helpful for those needing access to conventional banking systems since they may be used by anybody with an internet connection, regardless of where they live or their financial standing. Last, some people see Bitcoin and other decentralized currencies as good investment options because of their growth potential.\n\nThe benefits of decentralized currencies are attracting more and more users and investors, and this trend is expected to continue in the years to come.\n\nThe 7 Advantages of Decentralized Currencies\n\nBecause of its many advantages over centralized currencies, decentralized ones like Bitcoin are quickly gaining popularity in the financial sector. Transactions in these digital currencies are recorded on a distributed ledger system known as a blockchain and are not subject to the oversight of any governing body or central authority. Users benefit from increased safety, privacy, and convenience, cheaper transaction costs, and the possibility of value appreciation. This essay will examine the rising popularity of decentralized currencies among users and investors by looking at their top benefits.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvantages of Decentralized Currencies:\n\n1. Financial Inclusion\n\nThe principle of financial inclusion is that all people, regardless of location or socioeconomic status, should have equal opportunity to use and benefit from the financial system. Banking, loaning, insurance, and other financial services may fall under this category. Sadly, many people need help accessing these services because of the significant obstacles to entry posed by conventional financial institutions, such as account minimums or credit score restrictions.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies provide a decentralized alternative to conventional banking systems, which may facilitate greater financial inclusion. In contrast to fiat money issued by central banks, decentralized currencies do not need a bank account or a credit history for their use. Instead, access to the internet and a digital wallet is required to make and receive financial transactions.\n\n2. Immunity To Inflation\n\nIt is often believed that decentralized currencies, such as Bitcoin, are unaffected by inflation resulting from either government policy or economic shocks. This is because the quantity of such currencies is usually capped or otherwise preset, protecting them against abrupt spikes in supply that would otherwise cause their value to drop.\n\nYet, traditional currencies often experience inflationary pressures. Inflation may result from governments and central banks increasing the money supply by printing more currency or reducing interest rates. As a result, people may find it more costly to acquire necessities like food and shelter when the value of their currency decreases due to inflation.\n\nIn many cases, the total quantity of money that one may generate is capped for decentralized currencies like Bitcoin. Because of its small supply, it is less vulnerable to inflationary pressures brought on by spikes in production.\n\n3. Transparency\n\nOne of the main benefits of decentralized currencies like Bitcoin is their openness. All transactions on the blockchain are open and available to the public. The system may gain confidence and responsibility from its users if all transactions are public and easily accessible.\n\nIt might be challenging to see who did what and when in conventional monetary systems. Nevertheless, unlike controlled currencies, decentralized currencies are entirely transparent. This might make it harder to verify the legality of a transaction.\n\nThe blockchain is a public database that records every Bitcoin transaction, including the sender\u2019s address, the recipient\u2019s address, and the amount sent or received. The system may gain confidence and responsibility from its users if all transactions are public and easily accessible.\n\n4. No Geographic Barriers\n\nBitcoin and other decentralized currencies benefit from being global. This eliminates the necessity for centralized clearinghouses like banks or financial organizations in all but minor transactions.\n\nGeographical obstacles in traditional financial systems may make using them more accessible for certain people. For instance, some people may need more accessible access to banking services because they live in a rural or economically disadvantaged location. They may require assistance shopping or apply for credit as a result.\n\nThe opposite is true with decentralized currencies, which anybody with access to the internet may use. This eliminates the need for centralized monetary authorities such as banks or other financial organizations, making it possible for people in economically disadvantaged regions to make transactions and access financial services.\n\n5. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)\n\nDAOs are intended to operate without the oversight of a single person or group or are \u201ccompletely autonomous and decentralized.\u201d Instead, they are governed by the blockchain\u2019s community of stakeholders in exchange for governance tokens.\n\nDecisions in a DAO are made using a decentralized voting system. Decisions are made based on the results of votes cast by everyone in possession of governance tokens for the organization. This eliminates strict hierarchies and permits a more democratic, bottom-up decision-making approach.\n\n6. Potential for Growth\n\nBitcoin and other decentralized currencies have tremendous room for development, which is one of their primary benefits. Its potential originates from the fact that decentralized currencies are not anchored to any one national or economic system and may therefore function outside of established monetary frameworks.\n\nDecentralized currencies are not managed by the federal government or any other single entity like conventional financial systems. They may be employed in nations where the currency is volatile or where there are stringent limitations on money movement.\n\nMoreover, decentralized currency usage helps protect against inflation and economic uncertainty. For instance, individuals in nations with significant inflation may prefer to keep their wealth in decentralized currencies like Bitcoin. This may provide some insurance against currency depreciation and inflation.\n\n7. Security and Privacy\n\nDecentralized currencies, such as Bitcoin, provide several benefits, including security and anonymity. Blockchain technology is one of the key reasons behind this.\n\nCryptography is used to increase security. Blockchain transactions are protected by elaborate mathematical procedures, making them difficult to hack. Since it is decentralized, the blockchain has no single vulnerable point. Because of this, it\u2019s harder for hackers and cybercriminals to break in and steal money.\n\nDecentralized currencies enable users to avoid disclosing their financial information and history to financial organizations, a requirement of conventional economic systems. Furthermore, decentralized currencies help protect users\u2019 anonymity. Because of this, more people are opting for trading bots like Bitcoin Loophole. Pseudonymity is preserved throughout blockchain transactions since users are known only by their public addresses, not their names or other identifying details. This allows for a degree of discretion and anonymity unavailable via more conventional means of exchanging money.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are several benefits to using a decentralized currency like Bitcoin rather than a centralized one. Many people and companies would benefit from using decentralized currencies because of their desirable features, including their potential for growth, security, privacy, and resistance to inflation.\n\nDecentralized currencies are an intriguing and promising new development in the world of money, even though they still present significant difficulties and dangers. Decentralized currency markets are poised for further expansion and innovation as blockchain technology undergoes constant refinement and new applications and use cases are created.\n\nDecentralized currency markets are poised for further development and innovation as blockchain technology continuously improves and new applications and use cases are made. Decentralized currency markets are poised for further growth and innovation as blockchain technology undergoes continuous refinement and new applications and use cases are created."

        "content": "On April 26, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill to increase the U.S. debt ceiling. This led analysts to weigh its potential impact on the price of Bitcoin (BTC), ranging from highly bearish to overly bullish.\n\nUltimately, U.S. dollar liquidity is the key to both of these opposing viewpoints.\n\n\u201cDeflationary recession\u201d to produce 2020-like BTC rally?\n\nSome analysts, including Jesse Meyers, the chief operating officer of investment firm Onramp, believe raising the debt ceiling would prompt the Federal Reserve to print more money, thus boosting capital inflows into \u201crisky\u201d assets like Bitcoin.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart vs. U.S. dollar liquidity. Source: TradingView\n\nThe debt ceiling represents the maximum amount of money the U.S. government can borrow to pay its bills.\n\nRelated: Fed balance sheet adds $393B in two weeks \u2014 Will this send Bitcoin price to $40K?\n\nRaising it means it can issue more debt to generate more capital. But since the Fed is not buying bonds anymore thanks to its \u201cquantitative tightening\u201d and the flow of available money crashing, U.S. government debt may find it hard to attract buyers.\n\nM2 money supply year-over-year flow versus stock. Source: Bloomberg\n\nIn other words, a deflationary recession is coming, with Meyers believing it will force the Fed to return to a quantitive easing policy.\n\n\u201cWhen the debt ceiling is lifted and credit-contraction leads to economic crisis... They will have to print money on a massive scale,\u201d he stated, adding:\n\n\u201cBitcoin was the winner during the last round of stimulus.\u201c\n\nDollar credibility blow would boost Bitcoin price\n\nThe government has already hit its $31.4 trillion debt ceiling in January 2023 and theoretically cannot generate more capital until the U.S. Senate passes the bill to raise the ceiling.\n\nU.S. public debt to date. Source: FRED\n\nHowever, it\u2019s unlikely to pass the Senate, with President Joe Biden also vowing to veto the bill.\n\nThe standoff could result in the U.S. government defaulting on its debt in June, which poses negative consequences for the U.S. dollar, according to Jeff John Roberts, crypto editor at Fortune.\n\n\u201cIf [Republicans] decide to go the kamikaze route during the current debt ceiling standoff, it will deliver another major hit to the dollar\u2019s credibility\u2014and a further boost to Bitcoin,\u201d he stated.\n\nMeanwhile, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers downplayed the fears associated with a potential debt default, saying the odds of it happening stand under 2%:\n\n\u201cI think the odds that we will default in the sense of insolvency, and over some interval people who hold bonds will not be able to get paid, are - assuming the absence of a major war - certainly under 2% over the next decade.\u201c\n\nFed won\u2019t do quantitative easing, bears argue\n\nPresenting a similar outlook, analyst TedTalksMacro says extending the debt ceiling would ensure that the Fed continues contracting its balance sheet through ongoing quantitative tightening (QT).\n\nThat points to lower liquidity and, in turn, more downside pressure for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cOne caveat to the liquidity down/sideways for the rest of 2023 would be the Fed winding up or slowing the current pace QT,\u201d TedTalksMacro adds.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Tim Draper, one of the most known Silicon Valley venture capitalists, has played a crucial role in the Draper VC dynasty. Not only because he was an early investor in tech firms like Tesla and Skype but also because he made a turn in the Draper family\u2019s path to Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn the latest episode of Cointelegraph\u2019s Crypto Stories, Draper tells the story of how the Draper dynasty became bullish on Bitcoin, the broader crypto market and blockchain technology.\n\nThe Draper family crypto story started years ago when he grew interested in ways to exchange virtual goods against fiat currency and vice versa.\n\n\u201cI met this great guy from Korea, and he said that he had to buy his son a sword, and it was for the son's birthday, and it was $40,\u201d Draper reminisced about his early crypto thoughts. The sword turned out to be not a real sword but a virtual one, which made Draper think about virtual stores of value versus traditional money. He said:\n\n\u201cSo people are buying virtual goods with fiat currency? And then I thought, \u2018Well, maybe there will be fiat currency to buy fiat goods.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter Bitcoin came along in 2009, Draper was already looking for something like BTC cryptocurrency, and he started accumulating BTC early. \u201cIt was the universal currency, it was the currency for our entire earth,\u201d he said.\n\nEven after losing 40,000 Bitcoin to the collapsed exchange Mt. Gox back in 2011, Draper didn\u2019t lose faith in Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s cryptocurrency. He continued buying Bitcoin, bagging 30,000 BTC from a state auction of BTC seized from Silk Road in 2014.\n\nRelated: Tim Draper recommends founders hold \u2019at least\u2019 two payrolls \u2018worth of cash\u2019 in crypto\n\nDraper\u2019s passion for cryptocurrency was naturally passed on to his sons, Adam and Billy Draper. A fourth-generation venture capitalist, Adam Draper in 2012 founded Boost VC, an early stage venture capital firm focused on crypto. The company raised $90 million for its third round in September 2022. Adam\u2019s brother, Billy, has also been vocal about the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAccording to Tim, both his sons became somehow involved in the crypto industry after he became a Bitcoin bull.\n\nTim, Billy, Bill, Adam and Eleanor Draper. Source: Draper Cygnus\n\n\u201cMy son was very enthusiastic about me doing it. Both sons actually were about to work with me and the other one started a Boost accelerator and he decided that after I bought that Bitcoin he would create an accelerator just focused on Bitcoin,\u201d Draper said.\n\nOn the other hand, Tim\u2019s father, Bill Draper, has remained skeptical about crypto no matter what. \u201cMy father was not enthusiastic about it at all,\u201d Tim said, adding his father has always advised him to stick with the U.S. dollar.\n\nFollow the full story: How Tim Draper made a fortune investing in Bitcoin | Crypto Stories Ep. 23"

        "content": "Gary Harmon, the brother of the man jailed for operating the Helix cryptocurrency mixer, was himself on Thursday jailed for stealing bitcoin his brother\u2019s operation had generated while it was subject to forfeiture.\n\nHarmon, 31, from Cleveland, Ohio, has been sentenced to four years and three months in prison for using the seed recovery words to recreate his brother\u2019s offline cryptocurrency wallet while it was in the possession of the FBI.\n\nLarry Harmon, Gary\u2019s brother, ran the Helix mixer from 2014 to 2017. He had partnered with various dark web markets \u2014 including AlphaBay, Cloud 9, and Evolution \u2014 to provide tumbling services to their customers.\n\nTumbling or mixing services generally charge a fee to pool together large amounts of funds from various owners, then \"mix\" the funds together and distribute them back out to destination addresses, which makes it difficult to trace digital coins to their original owners.\n\nProsecutors said over the course of its operations Helix moved over 350,000 bitcoins, amounting to more than $300 million at the time of the transactions.\n\nFollowing Larry Harmon\u2019s arrest in February 2020, law enforcement seized a range of assets from him including a Trezor Model One hardware wallet, which was found magnetically attached to the underside of a table at one of his properties.\n\nAlthough the cryptocurrency stored on this device was subject to forfeiture in the criminal case, due to \u201cadditional security features\u201d the FBI was initially unable to recover the digital assets.\n\nTo physically access the hardware, investigators would have needed to plug it into a computer and enter a passcode, but Trezor devices also allow users to create \u201chidden wallets\u201d that are protected by an additional passphrase, without which they are not only inaccessible but invisible on the storage system.\n\nAccording to court documents, the FBI only learned of these hidden wallets after recovering a spreadsheet from Larry Harmon\u2019s Google Drive account that stated he had more than $56 million in cryptocurrency assets in hidden wallets.\n\nWhile the FBI was attempting to break into the storage device, Gary Harmon \u2014 who was not at that point under arrest \u2014 effectively recreated the device\u2019s bitcoin wallets using the recovery seed words, including the 16 hidden wallets.\n\nGary Harmon then transferred more than 712 digital coins \u2014 valued at $4.8 million at the time, and over $20 million today \u2014 into new wallets. These transfers were observed by law enforcement\u2019s blockchain monitoring specialists.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, whoever was behind the transfers then \u201cfurther laundered the proceeds through two online bitcoin mixer services before using the laundered bitcoins to finance large purchases and other expenditures.\u201d\n\nThe FBI conducted a voluntary interview with Harmon at this stage, and he denied any knowledge of the transactions.\n\nHowever, despite being unemployed and living what court documents described as \u201ca modest lifestyle\u201d prior to the removal of the bitcoins, shortly afterward Harmon \u201cbegan making thousands of dollars in unexplained cash deposits into his bank accounts.\u201d\n\nThese purchases included a 2018 Audi S5 luxury automobile; flights by TapJets, a private charter jet company that accepts bitcoin as payment; and, on February 12, 2021, more than 16 million dogecoins.\n\nHarmon was arrested on July 28, 2021, at his \"luxury condominium unit\" in Cleveland. He pleaded guilty in January 2023 to wire fraud and obstruction of justice and agreed to forfeit more than 647.41 in bitcoin, 2.14 ethereum, and 17,404,400.64 dogecoin.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice stated that \u201cdue to the increase in market prices, the total value of these forfeitable properties exceeds $12 million.\u201d"

        "content": "Gary Harmon admitted to stealing the money after his brother, Larry, was caught running a massive crypto laundering scheme.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A Cleveland man will spend the next four years and three months in federal prison for his role in a multi-million-dollar cryptocurrency scheme.\n\nGary Harmon received his sentence Friday in Washington, D.C.'s U.S. District Court. The 31-year-old previously pleaded guilty to wire fraud and obstruction of justice after stealing more than 712 bitcoin, valued at roughly $4.8 million.\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice, the case has its roots in an earlier plot perpetrated by Harmon's older brother, Akron native Larry Harmon. Larry ran a crypto money laundering service known as Helix, and prosecutors say he used the dark web to pilfer more than 350,000 bitcoin that was worth upwards of $300 million at the time.\n\nLarry Harmon was arrested in February 2020 and had his assets seized, but during the proceedings, Gary Harmon purportedly used his brothers credentials to illegally transfer hundreds of bitcoin to his own pockets and hide the money from possible forfeiture.

        "title": "The Bitcoin transition: How hodlers can become changemakers and drive adoption - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "If Bitcoin (BTC) were a country, it might be one of the biggest in the world. That\u2019s according to Jeff Booth, general partner at Bitcoin venture fund Ego Death Capital and author of The Price of Tomorrow: Why Deflation is the Key to an Abundant Future. Cointelegraph spoke to Booth to better understand and visualize the Bitcoin movement\u2019s state in 2023.\n\nBooth sat down to enjoy a pint and a chat about Bitcoin in Bedford, a small suburban town that has attracted Bitcoin advocates and key opinion leaders from all over the world. Booth commented on the emergence and resilience of the Bitcoin community and how people can get involved personally in the decade ahead.\n\nJeff Booth (right) speaks to Cointelegraph\u2019s Joe Hall\n\nBooth suggested that the Bitcoin community could usher in a fundamental change to the world if its members dedicated more of their time to the cause. He said that change could be spurred \u201cif all of those people just said, I\u2019m moving and spending more of my time in this to massively step-change the adoption rate.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin hodlers \u2014 those that hold onto their Bitcoin in the hopes of the currency reaching mass adoption \u2014 are the backbone of Bitcoin. However, if more of those people could actively use their Bitcoin, the movement could pick up steam and reach its goal faster, Booth argues:\n\n\u201cIt would be staggering if the people that were just holding as a hedge decided, I\u2019m going to advance, I\u2019m going to spend more time in the world I want to see and move their time and attention there. The world would move there. I saw it in myself.\u201d\n\nFrom simple steps like asking if merchants accept Bitcoin to businesses choosing to accept Bitcoin as a preferred means of exchange, there are certain moves that people can make to further the cause. In-person Bitcoin meetups also contribute. Booth commented on the impact of the Bitcoin-themed Real Bedford football team as a way to introduce Bitcoin to a wider audience:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s [Peter McCormack] using this vehicle to advance a whole bunch of other stuff, which is really cool.\u201c\n\nPeter McCormack told Cointelegraph in a separate interview that the Bitcoin movement in 2023 covers far more than the currency: \u201cIt\u2019s Nostr, it\u2019s Bitcoin, it\u2019s mainstream media lies, it is poor governance and regulation.\u201d Nostr is a decentralized protocol championed by Bitcoin advocates. Nostr applications like Damus seek to compete with Twitter and other popular social media platforms.\n\nBooth shared that there are more and more ways to use and engage with Bitcoin since his \u201cinitiation\u201d into Bitcoin, sometimes referred to as taking the \u201corange pill.\u201d The Canadian observes that the payments network; the Lightning Network, and Fedimint; a solution for shared custody, present more ways for Bitcoin enthusiasts to get stuck in. Moreover, a lot of engagement and interaction with these Bitcoin subsets takes place online:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many friends that I\u2019ve actually never met, and I consider them close friends that over time you develop these relationships, these online relationships that you\u2019ve never met.\u201d\n\nBooth added, \u201cThere is something about meeting in person and spending that time going deeper doing this, and there\u2019s something about that that I don\u2019t think can be replaced online.\u201d Initiatives like McCormack\u2019s in Bedford help bridge that gap and encourage Bitcoiners to engage with the local community.\n\nRelated: What security? Bitcoin enthusiast cracks known 12-word seed phrase in minutes\n\nPlus, given that Bitcoiners are currently distributed across the globe, with communities popping up in Senegal, Guatemala and Vietnam, Booth sees potential for local network effects to develop.\n\n\u201cHow many Bitcoiners are actually just holding it and are waiting?\u201d he asked.\n\nIf the hodlers and those \u201cholding it [Bitcoin] as a hedge\u201d decided to spend more time in the world they want to see, and move both their time and attention there, then, as Booth concludes: \u201cThe world would move there.\u201c\n\nThis interview is part of an upcoming documentary about Bitcoin in Bedford shown on Cointelegraph\u2019s YouTube channel.

        "title": "How would a US debt default impact Bitcoin? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Macro Markets, hosted by crypto analyst Marcel Pechman, airs every Friday on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel and explains complex concepts in layperson\u2019s terms, focusing on the cause and effect of traditional financial events on day-to-day crypto activity.\n\nThe risks of a United States debt default are the first topic of this week\u2019s show, which comes from none other than Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Yellen warned of potential mass unemployment, payment failures and broad economic weakness if the U.S. failed to pay its debts. This issue emerges every couple of years, creating some tension within Congress, but at some point, they agree to raise the debt limit. So, no harm done, right?\n\nThat\u2019s partially true because if the government doesn\u2019t have a majority, which happens to be the case, the opposition has the upper hand to bargain their demands. In this case, Republicans want President Joe Biden to drop $4.5 trillion in unsound projects, such as letting go of some of the student debt or hiring thousands of Internal Revenue Service employees.\n\nPechman explains how the event, whatever the outcome, is bullish for Bitcoin (BTC) and discusses the odds of a government debt default and how the debt ceiling increase drives liquidity to the markets, favoring scarce assets.\n\nThe next segment of Macro Markets focuses on Tesla, the EV automaker controlled by Elon Musk. Firstly, he\u2019ll go over its importance for Bitcoin holders and the cryptocurrency sector then proceed to summarize the company\u2019s financial conditions and why the 9,200 BTC held by Tesla doesn\u2019t pose a risk for Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nThe show concludes by examining how short-selling works. Unlike futures contracts, to sell a stock on margin, one needs to borrow it from a holder. Typically, those rates are negligent, maybe between 0.3% and 3% per year. However, when there\u2019s excessive betting against the stock price and the demand for shorts increases, this rate can go as high as 50% per year or become unavailable.\n\nIn the semi-failed First Republic Bank\u2019s case, which saw net redemptions of $100 billion in the previous quarter, short sellers are having trouble borrowing the stock, but Pechman explains how that does not pose a problem to those interested in betting on the bank\u2019s stock price decline. According to Marcel, the bailout of First Republic Bank can further catapult Bitcoin above $30,000.\n\nIf you are looking for exclusive and valuable content provided by leading crypto analysts and experts, make sure to subscribe to the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.

        "content": "While all eyes are on Bitcoin\u2019s creep toward $30,000 and Ether\u2019s double-digit year-to-date jump, another cryptocurrency has quietly surpassed the gains of both since the start of the year.\n\nSolana, or SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, has shot up 133% since trading at just $10 on Jan. 1, continuing to shrug off any reputational hit from being associated with Sam Bankman-Fried. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is up 78% and Ether is up just over 50% over the same period.\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s market capitalization sank to $5.3 billion the day after FTX declared bankruptcy, it has since recovered 72% to $9.1 billion. It was up 3% over 24 hours on Friday afternoon, trading at $22.86. Bitcoin and Ether were both down about 1%, at $29,300 and $1,800, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe number of successful transactions on the Solana blockchain rose to 713 million in March\u2014the most since October\u2014according to data tracker FlipSide. The total number of transactions is still down year over year largely due to a lagging bear market.\n\nThe Solana blockchain, which backs the Solana cryptocurrency, pitches itself as a faster and cheaper alternative to the Ethereum blockchain, still the most popular for decentralized apps such as NFT marketplaces and financial applications.\n\nBut Solana\u2019s pitch as an \u201cEthereum killer\u201d has hit some snags, including a number of recent outages and slowdowns. In February, a performance disruption resulted in issues with transactions and caused validators, who verify transactions on the blockchain, to restart the network to resolve the problem. Solana also faced a setback in the NFT space earlier this year when two of its most popular collections, y00ts and DeGods, left the blockchain.\n\nAustin Federa, head of strategy for the Solana Foundation, previously told Fortune he wasn\u2019t concerned about the projects leaving.\n\nJust a month after losing those collections, a new project, Mad Lads, is bringing some excitement back to Solana NFTs. The collection, created by the Web3 company Coral\u2014cofounded by Solana developer Armani Ferrante\u2014launched this week and has already become the most traded NFT with the highest sales volume over the past seven days, according to Crypto Slam.\n\nCompared with $11.4 million for Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, Mad Lads generated $17 million in sales over the last seven days, according to Crypto Slam. The Mad Lads trading frenzy also helped the Solana blockchain stay just above Polygon in number of transactions over the past week, according to Crypto Slam, even as Starbucks and other big companies flocked to the latter blockchain.\n\nMad Lads is one of the first of a new type of non-fungible token called executable NFTs, or xNFTs. While most NFTs are tied to centralized websites to provide the experiences they promise, xNFTs allow for built-in functionality. It could allow a game developer, for example, to mint an entire game as limited-edition xNFTs. For Mad Lads, the pictures act as a chat room for users that\u2019s rendered entirely within the NFT, thanks to Coral\u2019s new crypto wallet, Backpack, Federa wrote in a blog post.\n\nFedera said Mad Lads\u2019 launch is proof that Solana\u2019s more flexible NFT technology is a boon for entrepreneurs and creators.\n\n\u201cNFTs on Solana has always been a little bit different than other chains,\u201d Federa told Fortune. \u201cThere\u2019s this sort of relentless innovation and a drive to experiment.\u201d"

I\u2019ll give you all 12 words but in no particular order. Standard derivation path m/84'/0'/0'\u2026no fancy tricks. GL.\u201d\n\nIt took just 25 minutes to unlock the 100,000 satoshis, worth just under $30. The incident serves as a timely reminder for Bitcoin users and crypto enthusiasts to take crypto security seriously.\n\nFraser cracked the code using BTCrecover, a software application available on GitHub. The software offers a range of tools that can determine seed phrases with missing or scrambled mnemonics and passphrase-cracking utilities. Over Twitter DMs, Fraser told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cMy gaming GPU was able to determine the correct order of the seed phrase in about 25 minutes. Though a more capable system would do it much faster.\u201d\n\nHe noted that anyone with a basic knowledge of running Python scripts, using the Windows command shell, and understanding the Bitcoin protocol\u2014particularly BIP39 mnemonics \u2014 should be able to replicate his success.\n\nCointelegraph queried Fraser about the security of 12-word seed keys. Fraser explained they are \u201cperfectly secure if the words remain unknown to an attacker or there is a passphrase \u201813th seed word\u2019 used in the derivation path of the wallet.\u201d\n\nMoreover, he emphasized the superior security of 24-word seed keys.\n\n\u201cEven if an attacker knew the out of order words of your 24-word seed key, they would never stand a hope of discovering the correct seed.\u201d\n\nFraser broke down the entropy calculations to explain the difference in security between the two types of seed keys. A 12-word seed has approximately 128 bits of entropy, while a 24-word seed boasts 256 bits. When an attacker knows the unordered words of a 12-word seed, there are only around half a billion possible combinations, which is relatively easy to test with a decent GPU. A 24-word seed, however, has roughly 6.24^24 possible combinations \u2014 and that\u2019s a lot of zeros.\n\nRelated: The worst places to keep your crypto wallet seed phrase\n\nEven the probability of an attacker cracking a 12-word seed phrase is borderline absurd. A 24-word seed phrase may be superior, but as Wicked pointe out in a post-mortem to the seed phrase challenge, \u201cit\u2019s not going to be hacked tbh.\u201d\n\nIn the off chance that someone finds your seed phrase cut up and out of order, then yes lol. \u2014 Wicked (@w_s_bitcoin) April 27, 2023\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s a timely reminder to readers to ensure seed phrases are never published or shared online. That means seed phrases should not be stored in a password manager or a cloud storage solution, and they certainly should not be typed out into a phone.\n\nFraser also stressed the importance of keeping seed keys secret and to take advantage of a passphrase that functions as part of the derivation path. As for the 100,000 sats that Fraser took home? Fraser tweeted that he spent them on dinner that night: chicken marsala. Talk about circular economy.\n\nCointelegraph Magazine: Bitcoin in Senegal: Why is this African country using BTC?"

        "title": "Bitcoin keeps wavering between a store of value and a high-risk asset. How investors square that with their traditional ... - CNBC",
        "content": "Investors aren't sure what to make of bitcoin right now. Since the beginning of the year, the cryptocurrency has behaved as both a risk asset and a hedge against uncertainty. That's been especially true since turmoil in the U.S. banking sector began in March and returned volatility to the market. Bitcoin has soared 77% this year. Volatility (and therefore uncertainty) is a key characteristic of cryptocurrencies \u2013 at least for now. Despite what looks and sounds like institutional adoption and mainstream advancement, it's still very early days for the industry, so getting comfortable with the unpredictability is step one to being a good investor in it, according to Tyrone Ross, president and founder of financial planning firm 401 Financial. \"If you make an investment into bitcoin, you understand that this is par for the course, it just is,\" he told CNBC. \"You can dollar cost average in and hold it. Traders who have used a lot of leverage and have gotten liquidated in shorts \u2013 those folks have a whole different set of issues than those that are really looking at it as an investment. These moves should not bother you if you are really an investor in bitcoin and understand it.\" \"Believe in the core reasons for which you put money in and hopefully there are some 'narratives' around that that you can hang on to when it gets really volatile like this,\" he added. Bitcoin spent much of 2022 being tied to stocks, with inflation data and Fed policy as its main price drivers. That correlation has been sliding since the beginning of this year, but bitcoin remains sensitive to the macro economy. Meanwhile, its correlation with gold spiked in early March when the banking crisis began. This week, just as crypto volatility had returned to pre-banking crisis lows , troubles at First Republic Bank reignited concerns about the health of U.S. banks and bitcoin rallied as much as 8% . Still, investors are holding their breath for the next policy decision by the Fed at its meeting next week \u2013 with many expecting a hard landing, and positioning for dollar debasement and interest rate cuts. Additionally, with so much liquidity having been drained from the market these past two months, investors aren't trusting any bitcoin rally to turn into the next great bull run. \"Because bitcoin takes on a lot of asset profiles \u2013 risk asset, store of value, VC-like nascent asset class \u2013 investing in it is actually really attractive,\" said Greg King, CEO of investment company Osprey Funds. \"Truly uncorrelated assets, with unpredictable behavior and a positive expected value, are rare jewels in terms of portfolio allocation.\" \"Being highly volatile means that even a small allocation of bitcoin to a portfolio is enough to make the investment noticeable,\" he added. A very early technology play Looking at the price path on short timeframes, bitcoin will and often does mimic high-risk assets. The volatility will go away though, as it has for other new technology advancements before it, according to Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian investment fund manager 3iQ. He pointed out that over the past 10 years, bitcoin has declined from 5x more volatile than the Nasdaq in 2015 to 3x in 2019, to just 1.8x at the end of last year. \"The qualities that make it an exponential grower bear out over periods of quarters and years,\" he said. \"It's declining its volatility profile at a greater rate relative to equities,\" he said. \"Mature assets don't have high adoption rates,\" he added. \"People already own all the equities they're going to own. We're not going to have another 20% of people buy equities because there aren't 20% of people around to buy equities \u2013 birth rates are down, portfolios are mature.\" Ross had a nuanced view, arguing that bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. BTC.CM= 1Y mountain Bitcoin over the past year For the past decade traders have tried to understand bitcoin's identity, sometimes with little patience for its newness and ability to morph from one thing to another. It was designed to be digital cash for those excluded from the formal financial system. New entrants to the market that came in the 2021 bull run were sold on the idea of a hedge against inflation. They've gotten used to it trading like a stock. \"Is it pristine collateral for some folks? Perhaps,\" Ross said. \"Is it a better currency for some folks? Yes. Is it an inflation hedge? It didn't seem like it was. Is it safety when First Republic Bank looks like it's on the brink of collapse? Sure. But it's a speculative asset that is highly volatile and benefits from a very liquid environment,\" he said. For Ross, it's also a technology bet. New crypto investors often overlook the Bitcoin technology, focusing instead on bitcoin the crypto asset. Ross is bullish on its ability to act as a financial system for those who can't access bank accounts. \"We have a venture capital investment essentially, with liquid pricing,\" Connors said. \"That's a combination we're not used to, so to have an understanding of it is job one. The second one is to size it appropriately so that you're not watching all the time.\" \"Volatility is a price you pay and, as people say, price is the least interesting thing about bitcoin \u2013 although that's a hard pill to swallow,\" Connors added."

        "content": "The University of Oxford estimates that they already consume 0.63% of the world's energy and result in higher electricity bills for households\n\nBy Miguel \u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda Vega\n\nIt is a young technology at barely 14 years old. It was meant to change the world. But, for the time being, it has become an energy problem. The shine of cryptocurrencies is far from sustainable. The most famous of the hundreds in existence, Bitcoin, consumes 127 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity per year. More than Norway in the same time period. According to The New York Times, there are 34 large-scale cryptocurrency mines in the United States alone, putting tremendous pressure on the power grid. What's more, their carbon footprint is the equivalent of having 3.5 million more cars on the country's roads, the tech NGO WattTime points out. In Texas alone, according to a study by the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, the increased energy demand has caused households' electricity bills to rise 5%. That is, some $1.8 billion per year. \"They are unsustainable,\" says Gavin Brown, professor of Financial Technology at the University of Liverpool (UK). He adds: \"Oxford University estimates that cryptocurrencies account for 0.63% of electricity usage worldwide. This figure is slightly higher than Pakistan.\u201d A single Bitcoin transaction takes ten minutes. By comparison, Visa processes 1,700 per second.\n\nThis all started in hopes of improving the planet, of course. In 2008, the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin. A decentralized currency. In other words, its use and validation would be independent of the central banks. Instead of relying on those institutions to safeguard money, its transactions are verified by a sort of huge public ledger called blockchain. With this technology, in theory, intermediaries and commissions disappear. If it had existed in Picasso's Paris, it would have been considered a libertarian coin.\n\nHowever, what initially almost seemed like a hobby has unexpectedly become a huge industry. The value of Bitcoin jumped from $1,000 in 2017 to $60,000 in 2021. Nevertheless, since that date it has fallen sharply. But there are two sides to every coin. \"Bitcoin is an algorithm, and whenever you want to add a transaction to a blockchain (set of operations), you need to solve a complex cryptographic equation; that's called proof of work,\" explains Enrique Dans, professor of Innovation at IE Business School. It's simple. The \"currency\" consists of deciphering this equation. The problem? Competition is growing exponentially, and numbers are getting harder to find. Because only one miner will win the race. 99.9% will lose and waste energy needlessly. The only option? Put hundreds of thousands of computers (known as farms) to work on calculations. It therefore takes a lot of electricity to find the solution quickly and earn digital money. Miners who discover that solution are rewarded in bitcoins. It's the new gold rush of the 21st century. \"I think they're exploiting the [electricity] system,\" warns Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, an expert on energy prices. \"But they will say, 'You know, the system was already there,' and I'm sympathetic to that in some ways.\"\n\nHowever, this is not a sentiment that everyone shares. China banned bitcoin mining in August 2021. The country declared it \"undesirable.\" Despite all this, clandestine mining is still underway. Golden technology continues to exist. In fact, it is controlled by the United States (38%), China (20%, despite the ban), Kazakhstan (13%), Canada and Russia, with 6% of the market. Thousands of people sift through numbers just as prospectors used to sift through river water, panning for gold. As if the competition were not enough, the number of bitcoins is finite: 21 million units. According to Enrique Dans, an estimated 97% has already been mined. The business will then be in the exchange of digital currency.\n\nBitcoin is certainly not the only cryptocurrency with a disproportionate energy expenditure. A single Litecoin transaction requires 18,957 kilowatts, and the Bitcoin Cash variant comes in at 18,522. It has inevitably come under fire from critics. \"Bitcoin will always live in some dark corner of the internet, just like a virus protected in a bunker. There is no way of getting rid of every trace. We just have to convince as many people as possible to give it up and never raise it from the dead again,\" advises Pete Howson, professor of Environmental Science at Northumbria University (UK).\n\nHowever, some might remember that passage from the Old Testament and the voice of Christ: \"Lazarus, come forth.\" Ethereum (ETH) is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin. Last year, it reduced 99% of the energy required to solve the equation by changing algorithms. Instead of using miners, it relies on validators. Anyone with at least 32 ETH attains the rank of validator. The platform randomly selects them to approve the creation of new blocks. That is, to verify that user transactions comply with network standards. This program, which has taken years of work, is called \"Merge.\" The advantages will include speed, cost and transaction capacity. And a smaller carbon footprint.\n\nWith this \u201cgreen zeal,\u201d some cryptocurrencies have introduced pre-mining to avoid IT waste. The system works in a similar way to fiat currency (the old banknotes) and stocks. A central authority creates a fixed amount of a currency and releases it carefully, depending on what is happening in the world or the economy. Other virtual currencies, such as Ripple, are generated from algorithms. This eliminates teams of miners searching for the solution at a tremendous speed with their thousands of polluting computers.\n\nWithin this unpredictable world, what experts call \"market sentiment\" is moving towards greener digital currencies. One option is charging a fee for the carbon generated whenever a bitcoin is acquired. The fact that Daniel Batten, one of the most popular (22,000 followers) climate activists on Twitter, is also an investor in this currency shows \"that emissions in the mining of this cryptocurrency are decreasing rapidly,\u201d notes Simon Peters, an analyst at the E-Toro brokerage house. Despite all this, Bitcoin remains far behind Ethereum on the path to sustainability. \"And it's unlikely to change anytime soon,\" Peters clarifies.\n\nThere are also those who are willing to admit the enormous energy expenditure of these currencies and the effort they are making to limit it and use increasingly renewable sources. But we can't ignore the fine print. \"It is urgent to reduce the energy consumption of industrial and production activity as a whole,\" says Albert Salvany, a consultant at PriorityGate, a company specialized in artificial intelligence. \"But it is surprising how, at times, this concern does not extend to other activities that are far more important in terms of total volume per kilowatt-hour,\" he points out. Perhaps the reason is that all these complex equations are a socially sensitive issue. Many young people assumed it was an easy way to earn money. And they forgot that there was a lot of gambling involved. They rolled the dice, and almost everyone lost. The volatility (ups and downs) of these currencies is almost instantaneous. This also contains a valuable lesson. Norman Foster, perhaps the most influential architect of the last 50 years, grew up in a working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Manchester (UK). His mother was a waitress. Someone once asked him: What did you learn from your parents? \u201cThree words,\u201d he replied. \"Work, work, work.\" There are no shortcuts in life, not even digital ones.\n\nMiguel \u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda Vega\n\nHe has been writing for EL PA\u00cdS for some 25 years, currently for Cultura, Negocios, El Pa\u00eds Semanal, Retina, Suplementos Especiales, and Ideas.

        "title": "Got liquidated with Bitcoin futures? Get 3.5x leverage using this options strategy - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin bulls might be disappointed after the $31,000 resistance proved stronger than expected on April 14. However, looking at a broader time frame, Bitcoin (BTC) has been the best-performing asset in 2023, gaining over 74% year-to-date at $29,000.\n\nPositioning for weaker dollar, debt ceiling\n\nIt is worth noting that gold is merely 4% below its all-time high, likely indicating a weaker United States dollar as investors increase the odds of recession and further fiscal turmoil for the world\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nBehind the bullish price momentum for Bitcoin is the weakness in the U.S. financial system, namely the $100 billion in quarterly net withdrawals at First Republic Bank, and the legislative effort to approve an increase to the national debt ceiling.\n\nFor Bitcoin investors, a financial crisis is a net positive, as it forces the U.S. Federal Reserve to expand its emergency funding programs and take out additional unprofitable long-term debt from the system.\n\nCryptocurrency traders are uncomfortable with the regulatory environment, and the April 25 statement from the New York Federal Reserve further added to the uncertainty. The guidelines disclosed could potentially hinder USD Coin (USDC) issuer Circle\u2019s access to the Fed\u2019s securities reverse-repurchase program, the safest vehicle to get yield on deposits.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no way to predict how the banking crisis will unfold or the timeline for regulatory actions against exchanges and stablecoin issuers. On the other hand, \u201ceasy money\u201d policies are well known to every investor as extremely beneficial for scarce assets.\n\nSuch a scenario explains why professional traders have been using the bullish \u201ciron condor\u201d strategy to maximize gains if Bitcoin breaks above $32,000 in May with limited risk.\n\nCall and put Bitcoin options to hedge the bet\n\nBuying Bitcoin futures pays off during bull markets, but the issue lies in dealing with liquidations when BTC\u2019s price goes down. This is why pro traders use options strategies to maximize their gains and limit their losses.\n\nThe skewed iron condor strategy can yield profits above $31,400 by the end of May while limiting losses if the expiry price is below $31,000. It is worth noting that Bitcoin traded at $29,730 when the pricing for this model took place.\n\nBitcoin options iron condor strategy returns. Source: Deribit Position Builder\n\nThe call option gives its holder the right to acquire an asset at a fixed price in the future. For this privilege, the buyer pays an upfront fee known as a premium.\n\nMeanwhile, the put option allows its holder to sell an asset at a fixed price in the future, which is a downside protection strategy. On the other hand, selling a put offers exposure to the price upside.\n\nThe iron condor consists of selling the call and put options at the same expiry price and date. The above example has been set using the May 26 contracts, but it can be adapted for other timeframes.\n\nRelated: Kraken asks San Francisco court to intervene against IRS demands\n\nModest 6% Bitcoin price gain needed for profits\n\nAs depicted above, the target profit range is $31,420 (6% above the current $29,730 price) to $36,000 (21.2% above the current price). To initiate the trade, the investor needs to short (sell) 1.5 contracts of the $33,000 call option and three contracts of the $33,000 put option. Then, the investor must repeat the procedure for the $35,000 options, using the same expiry month.\n\nBuying 4.8 contracts of the $31,000 put option to protect from an eventual downside is also required. Lastly, one needs to purchase 7.8 contracts of the $36,000 call option to limit losses above the level.\n\nThis strategy\u2019s net profits peak at 0.225 BTC ($6,685 at current prices) between $33,000 and $36,000, but they remain above 0.063 BTC ($1,750 at current prices) if Bitcoin trades in the $31,850 and $35,700 range.\n\nThe investment required to open this skewed iron condor strategy is the maximum loss \u2014 0.063 BTC, or $1,750 \u2014 which will occur if Bitcoin trades below $31,000 on May 26.\n\nThe benefit of this trade is that a wide target area is covered while providing a potential 357% return versus the potential loss. In essence, it provides a leverage opportunity without the liquidation risks typical of futures contracts.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Influencer and ex-kick boxer Andrew Tate and his brother\u2019s Bitcoin BTC/USD holdings were reportedly seized by Romanian authorities in mid-February. Tate was incarcerated in Romania facing charges of human trafficking and rape after being arrested.\n\nMateea Petrescu, a spokesperson for Tate and his brother Tristan told Decrypt that, in addition to the arrests, hardware wallets containing a combined 21 Bitcoins, worth approximately $467,625, were confiscated.\n\nPetrescu said Andrew Tate\u2019s wallet contained five Bitcoin \u2014 currently valued at around $111,339 \u2014 while Tristan\u2019s wallet held 16 Bitcoin. Authorities in Romania also seized millions of dollars worth of luxury cars, homes, and watches belonging to Tate.\n\nIt should be noted that Tate had been outspoken about Bitcoin and its potential.\n\nIn a podcast late last year with Anthony Pompliano, Tate said \u201cIt\u2019s one of the simplest ways to take charge of your finances and move money quickly and securely. \u201cWith Bitcoin, you can actually control and own your money,\u201d he noted. \u201cThink about how hard it used to be to move large sums of cash around \u2013 no problem with Bitcoin!\u201d\n\nTate in the same podcast also revealed returns he\u2019s earned from his crypto investments: \u201c[I] turned $600,000 into $12 million,\u201d he said.\n\nAndrew Tate first came to prominence when he appeared on Big Brother in 2016, but was removed from the programe after a video surfaced online wherein he was seen attacking a woman with a belt. Though he claimed that the video had been edited. He has built up a massive presence on social media, with approximately 6.4 million followers on Twitter alone.\n\nTate has been in the news since then due to his controversial comments and espousal of traditional \u2018manly\u2019 values, which have rubbed many in the mainstream press and \u2018woke\u2019 anti-masculinity zealots the wrong way."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin (BTC) may finally leave crypto winter behind and outshine the market in the coming months, according to a research report by Berenberg.\n\nSuch a possibility could be due to \u201ca combination of circumstances, evolution, and timing,\u201d reported the Hamburg-based multinational investment bank.\n\nNotably, analysts write, Bitcoin is practically the only digital asset to be characterized as a commodity rather than a security by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the decentralized nature of its blockchain protocol, as well as the upcoming Bitcoin halving that will see the rate at which new coins are produced and released into circulation cut in half, per the report author Mark Palmer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe halving cuts miner rewards in half. Currently, miners earn a reward of 6.25 Bitcoin; by next Spring, that figure will be 3.125.\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin halving events have been associated with a significant increase in the price of the asset, and Berenberg sees the next one as no different. Moreover, the next halving could also \u201cserve as catalyst\u2026 by extension,\u201d for MicroStrategy shares, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin reserves at about 140,000 BTC.\n\n\u201cIf history is any guide, then we believe the price of Bitcoin could rally ahead of and following this much-anticipated halving, with MSTR\u2019s stock offering a leveraged means through which investors can take advantage of that event,\u201d reads the report.\n\nWhile the price of Bitcoin rallied about 65% since the start of the year, MSTR is up almost 120% over the span.\n\nMicroStrategy stock closed the Thursday trading session at $318.64, with Berenberg covering MSTR with a buy rating and a $430 price target.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat is the Bitcoin halving?\n\nBitcoin halving is an event that occurs approximately every four years, with the protocol specifying that there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence. The halving is designed to gradually slow down the creation of new coins until the final one is mined in the year 2140.\n\nThe first Bitcoin halving took place in November 2012, when the mining reward was reduced from 50 BTC to 25 BTC per block. The second halving occurred in July 2016, reducing the reward to 12.5 BTC per block, and the third halving took place in May 2020, reducing the reward to 6.25 BTC per block.\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving is set to occur at block 840,000, which is estimated to happen approximately in April 2024, with the mining reward to be reduced once again by half.\n\nThe halving has important implications for Bitcoin's supply and demand dynamics. Slowing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, makes the asset slightly more scarce.\n\nOn the flip side, the halving makes mining less profitable for miners, as they receive fewer Bitcoins for the same amount of work. This can lead to a decrease in the network's hashrate and increased competition among miners.\n\nWhat other factors may boost the price of Bitcoin?\n\nBerenberg also argues that Bitcoin\u2019s recent appreciation can be seen \u201cas an indication that more investors are recognizing it as a sensible alternative not only among crypto tokens, but also within a global financial context.\u201d\n\nThe banking crisis earlier this year, the report reads, has also had a \"lingering impact\" on traditional finance, even arguing that investors have lost trust in the Federal Reserve \"due to its perceived mishandling of the interest-rate cycle.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bank said that these macro factors have led to concerns about de-dollarization\u2014the process of reducing or eliminating the use of the U.S. dollar in international trade and financial transactions\u2014and could potentially highlight the value proposition of Bitcoin as an alternative currency.\n\nThis is also what MSTR stock could benefit from \u201cif investors increasingly turn to Bitcoin as an alternative currency,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cAs such, we believe Bitcoin has emerged as a safe haven relative to other crypto tokens, and this advantaged position could spur demand for it,\u201d reads the report."

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin miner Bitfarms has hit a new milestone after growing operations in Argentina, the company said in an announcement to investors.\n\nOn Thursday, the group hit a hashrate of 5 exahash per second (EH/s), meaning 5 quintillion hashes per second were achieved.\n\nThe all-time high was attributed to the expansion of production at its farm in Argentina, which was first fired up last year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe facility, in Rio Cuarto, immediately boosted Bitfarms\u2019s hashrate to 4.1 EH/s from 3.9 when it went live in September.\n\nThis has continued to increase, as the business takes advantage of low energy costs in the region.\n\nThe most recent increase came as 2,100 new miners were energized earlier this week, while some existing miners who had been \u201cunderclocked\u201d were brought to full capacity.\n\n\u201cThis exciting moment reflects our team\u2019s hard work over the last two years resulting in our largest, most advanced, and lowest cost facility,\u201d said Geoff Morphy, CEO of Bitfarms.\n\nHe added that the business is now targeting a hashrate of 6 EH/s by the end of the year, as it takes advantage of further expansion opportunities.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nArgentina expansion plans\n\nThe company has already purchased another 6,200 new Bitmain and MicroBT miners, which chief mining officer Ben Gagnon said earlier this week would shortly be in transit and should bring the business\u2019s total hashrate to 5.7 EH/s once activated.\n\nEven more orders for new equipment are currently in the works.\n\nEnergy costs for the site are currently expected to be below $0.03 per KWh, Bitfarms CFO Jeff Lucas explained, giving Bitfarms a \u201cbest-in-class average cost of Bitcoin mined.\u201d\n\nBitfarms, which is listed on both the Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange, has a total of 10 mining facilities across Canada, the U.S., Paraguay, and Argentina.\n\nWhile the company uses hydroelectric power to mine Bitcoin at its other sites, the Argentina location uses natural gas.\n\nThe Argentina project was first announced in April 2021, with the initial contract due to last for eight years."

        "content": "Like Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV has large mining pools, each with a significant share of its SHA-256 hashrate. However, unlike the others, BSV has a nearly 44% majority who are \u201cunknown,\u201d according to data published by Coin.Dance.\n\nComparing the above to Bitcoin\u2019s same period chart, about 500% of the blocks in Bitcoin SV are mined by \u201cunknown\u201d compared to Bitcoin.\n\nThe situation led a Reddit user, who probably didn\u2019t notice that the \u201cunknown\u201d miner doesn\u2019t have to be a single outfit, to ask if an attack \u201cis developing. \u201d\n\nThree Pools Control Far More Than Anyone Else in Bitcoin SV\n\nPerhaps more interesting than the high amount of \u201cunknown\u201d miners able to find blocks on the nearly 1 exahash chain is the massive power of a few pools. SV Pool, Coingeek, and BMG Pool control more than unknown miners. A slight increase in their power could lead to them collectively having the 51% majority needed.\n\nNeed for what? An attack, of course.\n\n\u201cCollusion\u201d is yet another concern in scenarios like these.\n\nSV Pool is owned by Craig Wright, while Coingeek is owned by Calvin Ayre, both wealthy backers of the Bitcoin SV fork away from Bitcoin Cash. This is the genesis of a comment by a Redditor:\n\n[N]ah, it\u2019s still calvin/craig who operate more than 95% of the hash. They just switch up the distribution every once in a while to make it appear as more mining entities.\n\nClearly the comment is hyperbolic, in that SV Pool and Coingeek control around 35% between them. The comment does seem to suggest that many of the \u201cunknown\u201d operators are also Wright and Ayre, which would be difficult to verify.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/whbzIGML1qY\n\nCentralization and 51% Attack Concerns Loom\n\nIf you\u2019re still new to Bitcoin, a 51% attack, briefly, in part entails the power to \u201crewrite\u201d the blockchain. This involves the right to not-include or include transactions. The potential for fraud is high in such situations. It is generally an expensive endeavor, especially in networks with a great deal of hashpower, like any of the three Bitcoins.\n\nCCN.com recently reported that the Dash network was vulnerable to such an attack from a Nicehash miner. In the interim, the total network hashpower of Dash has gone up, while the power of Nicehash has gone down .\n\nCentralization concerns are ever-present in the minds of cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Any time a situation arises wherein one entity seems to have too much power, someone raises an alarm. People have raised alarms about Bitcoin in the past.\n\nBitcoin SV has the lowest hashrate of the three Bitcoin forks. It, therefore, makes for a nice use case for older mining hardware. Retired from service as the difficulty on the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash networks has grown exponentially, SHA256 hardware gets a second life on Bitcoin SV."

        "content": "What is the Bitcoin Whitepaper and why does it matter? Today we cover what it is.\n\nImagine a world where financial transactions are secure, fast, and free from intermediaries. A world where you have complete control over your money and can send it to anyone, anywhere, at any time\n\nIt sounds like a utopian dream, right?\n\nWell, guess what?\n\nThis dream has already become a reality thanks to a revolutionary invention known as Bitcoin.\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back and understand the foundation of this digital revolution: the Bitcoin whitepaper.\n\nIn October 2008, a mysterious figure named Satoshi Nakamoto released a nine-page document titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\u201d\n\nThis document, now commonly known as the Bitcoin Whitepaper, laid the groundwork for creating the first-ever cryptocurrency.\n\nTo this day, the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains a mystery.\n\nHowever, the revolutionary ideas presented in the whitepaper have profoundly impacted the worlds of finance and technology.\n\nThe Bitcoin whitepaper birthed the first cryptocurrency and sparked the entire blockchain industry, leading to over 4,000 unique cryptocurrencies.\n\nWe will examine the whitepaper\u2019s fundamental ideas, their significance in the crypto world, and their ongoing importance.\n\nSource: News18\n\nWhat is the famous Bitcoin paper? Key concepts explained\n\nYou might be wondering, \u201cWhat is the Bitcoin Whitepaper?\u201d\n\nSimply put, it is a document that details the technical aspects, philosophy, and purpose behind the invention of Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin whitepaper explains how Bitcoin works through decentralization, the blockchain, cryptographic hashing, and proof of work (PoW).\n\nDecentralization is key, as it removes the need for a central authority and instead relies on a network of nodes to validate and record transactions on the blockchain. This distributed system ensures resistance to censorship, fraud, and corruption.\n\nThe blockchain is a vital component of the Bitcoin system. It is a continuously growing ledger of transactions, grouped into blocks, and secured using cryptography.\n\nBlocks in the blockchain contain a list of transactions and unique identifiers. Each block\u2019s hash is linked to the previous block, creating an immutable chain.\n\nThis design provides tamper resistance, as changing a block requires changing all subsequent blocks, which is computationally infeasible.\n\nThe whitepaper also introduced Proof of Work, a consensus algorithm that uses miners to solve mathematical problems and validate transactions.\n\nThis process secures the network and ensures new coins\u2019 fair and transparent distribution.\n\nThe importance of a whitepaper in the cryptocurrency world\n\nNow that you know the answer to \u201cWhat is the famous Bitcoin paper?\u201d let\u2019s discuss the role of whitepapers in the broader cryptocurrency industry.\n\nA whitepaper is crucial to creating and launching any new cryptocurrency or blockchain-based project.\n\nIt is a comprehensive guide that provides potential investors, developers, and users with a clear understanding of the project\u2019s goals, technology, and roadmap.\n\nA well-written whitepaper should cover several key aspects, including the problem the project aims to solve, the proposed solution, the technology and architecture behind it, the tokenomics (i.e., the distribution, allocation, and use of tokens), the team and their qualifications, and the project\u2019s roadmap and milestones.\n\nBy providing this information, a whitepaper helps build trust and credibility, as it demonstrates the team\u2019s commitment to transparency and allows potential investors to make informed decisions.\n\nIn the fast-paced and often volatile world of cryptocurrencies, whitepapers play a vital role in helping investors and users differentiate between legitimate projects and scams.\n\nA poorly written or incomplete whitepaper may indicate that the project is poorly thought out or lacks the necessary resources to succeed.\n\nOn the other hand, a well-researched and professionally presented whitepaper can generate excitement and attract funding and community support, propelling the project toward success.\n\nSource: TechStory\n\nWhy is the whitepaper important in crypto? Its impact on the industry\n\nFirst, the significance of the Bitcoin whitepaper cannot be overstated.\n\nSecond, it has laid the foundation for the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and inspired countless innovations and new projects in the blockchain space.\n\nThe impact of the whitepaper is evident in the rapid growth and widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, which have the potential to disrupt various industries, from finance and supply chain management to healthcare and gaming.\n\nBy introducing the concept of decentralized, trustless systems, the Bitcoin whitepaper has challenged traditional financial institutions and paved the way for the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nAs a result, DeFi platforms leverage blockchain technology to offer financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading without the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors.\n\nThis can increase financial inclusion, reduce fees, and empower individuals to take control of their financial lives.\n\nMoreover, the whitepaper has inspired the development of various blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, that enable the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.\n\nThese innovations have expanded the use cases of blockchain technology beyond mere cryptocurrencies. They are opening up new possibilities for solving complex problems and driving efficiency across various sectors.\n\nConclusion: The ongoing significance of the Bitcoin whitepaper\n\nIn conclusion, the Bitcoin whitepaper remains influential.\n\nIt inspires new ideas in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries.\n\nIts principles are relevant in today\u2019s digital world.\n\nUnderstanding its technical aspects is essential to navigating cryptocurrencies and identifying promising projects."

        "title": "Bitcoin's Negative Correlation With Dollar Index Strengthens Ahead of U.S. GDP Data - Markets Insider",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has historically moved in the opposite direction to the dollar index (DXY), which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, including the euro.\n\nThe negative correlation has strengthened, reversing the brief let up witnessed in late March, and indicating scope for accelerated gains in the cryptocurrency in the case of a continued dollar slide following the release of the U.S. GDP data on Thursday.\n\nThe 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the dollar index has slipped to a two-month low of -0.70, according to data from charting platform TradingView. It had weakened to -0.11 four weeks ago.\n\nCorrelations are measured on a scale of -1 to +1. Values skewed towards -1 indicate that lower prices for one variable are associated with higher prices for the other.\n\nBitcoin and the DXY have been mostly negatively correlated over the past three years, except in times where crypto-specific factors overshadowed the dollar trends. For instance, bitcoin fell in late 2022 as the collapse of crypto exchange FTX kept investors from cheering weakness in the U.S. currency. A similar breakdown was seen in the lead up to Coinbase's Nasdaq debut in April 2021 and the launch of a futures-based exchange-traded fund in the U.S. the following October.\n\nFocus on GDP\n\nAt 12:30 UTC, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its preliminary estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP). The data is likely to show the world's largest economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.0%, a slower pace than the 2.6% of fourth-quarter 2022, according to Reuters estimates published by FXStreet.\n\nSeveral economic indicators and bond market metrics have been warning of an economic recession for months. The dollar index has declined by over 12% since early October in hopes that the Federal Reserve would halt interest rate hikes and resort to liquidity easing to support the economy.\n\nBesides, traders are back to pricing three interest-rate cuts by year-end in the wake of issues at First Republic Bank, even though the Fed did not cut rates and maintained a hawkish or anti-stimulus bias following the much severe banking crisis episode of March.\n\nWith so much dovish expectations already in the air, the GDP figure might have to indicate a sharper-than-expected moderation in economic activity to trigger a deeper dollar sell-off and rally in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nIt also means that a upbeat figure may see markets price out rate cuts and lift the dollar higher.\n\n\"The market eyes growth at 2% \u2013 shouldn't move markets too intently given the backward nature of the data point \u2013 would need to be a big beat/miss to the move rates expectations and the USD, gold, Nasdaq,\" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said in a tweet.\n\nAt press time, bitcoin changed hands at $29,010, representing a 2% gain on the day. The dollar index was little changed at 101.50.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Coindesk"

        "title": "Bitcoin Emerges As the King Of Assets,10X Growth Over Gold During US Banking Crisis - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Despite the volatile price action of Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency has outperformed every other asset, including gold. Although it is trading below its psychological milestone of $30,000 at $29,000, Bitcoin is expected to grow further in 2023, as it acts as a safe haven for investors amidst the US banking crisis.\n\nBitcoin Reigns Supreme As the Best-Performing Asset\n\nCapriole Investment, which provides research and analysis on cryptocurrencies, has reported that the current market cycle favors hard assets like gold, as indicated by the 200-week Gold-to-Stocks ratio. This classic indicator highlights when the market favors safe-haven assets like gold over riskier equity assets. Both gold and Bitcoin have generated some of their best returns during these phases.\n\nAs the market continues to favor hard assets, Bitcoin has emerged as the preferred safe haven for wealth amidst the US banking crisis and fiat currency weakness. During this period of high correlation, Bitcoin has outperformed gold by 10X in 2023, making it the best-performing asset of the year among major asset classes.\n\nThe strong positive correlation between Bitcoin and Gold has also increased significantly, making them attractive options for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and hedge against economic uncertainty. With unsustainable tightening, banking crises, and de-dollarization looming, the market is turning to these safe-haven assets to protect their wealth.\n\nAccording to the report by Capriole Investment, the current Bitcoin rally in 2023 is believed to be organic and spot driven. The report highlights a key metric showing total futures Open Interest as a ratio of the total Bitcoin and USDT market cap.\n\nThis metric provides insight into the market\u2019s leverage and shows that the crypto market leverage peaked with the FTX fraud in November 2022. Since then, this ratio has been on a one-way downtrend, despite Bitcoin\u2019s price rallying over 80% from $16,000 to $30,000. This indicates that there has been little speculation in the market this year.\n\nThe report suggests that until this ratio spikes or Bitcoin dominance peaks, the foundations for sustainable price appreciation remain in place. This means that the current rally is driven by organic demand rather than speculation, which is a positive sign for the long-term growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFurthermore, the report suggests that the decrease in leverage indicates a healthy market less vulnerable to sudden price drops. This is because a high level of leverage can often lead to market instability, causing sharp price swings and potentially resulting in a market crash.\n\nBTC\u2019s $30-32K Dilemma\n\nAccording to the report, Bitcoin is trading within the largest technical resistance block on the chart since $20,000. This region, which ranges from $30,000 to $32,000, represents the bottom of the 2021 range and the breakdown point into the bear market that began in 2022.\n\nAdditionally, it is a major weekly order block level and Fibonacci extension level from the prior cycle. $30,000 is also a major round number level, representing a 50% increase from the 2017 cycle all-time-high of $20,000, and $32,000 marks a 100% appreciation in Bitcoin since the FTX Fraud bottom at $16,000.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience in recent months, it is important to note that past performance is not an indicator of future results. However, according to Capriole\u2019s report, if Bitcoin manages to close above $32,000 weekly, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see a new trend carry its price into the $40,000 mark.\n\nFeatured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

However, some cryptocurrency analysts see this as a good sign and an indicator of a smoother ride toward a new all-time high (ATH) in 2023.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin spending a lot of time under the $30,000 mark before the next rally suggests less choppy movements around $40,000, $50,000, and even $60,000, with the possibility of an ATH this year, as observed in a tweet shared by crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto on April 26.\n\nHappy to spend as much time under 30k as possible before the next leg up starts.

On April 26, it seemed to be moving toward breaking the resistance again, as it briefly reached the price of $29,970, only to drop to $27,942 in a single hour but improving later on.\n\nMeanwhile, the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset was at press time changing hands at the price of $29,018, up 0.47% in the last 24 hours, as well as recording an equally modest increase of 0.64% across the previous seven days, adding up to the 6.75% gain on its monthly chart, as per data retrieved on April 27.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart.

        "content": "Thu 27 Apr 2023 \u25aa 8 min of reading \u25aa by Martin\n\nShould we unplug Netflix instead, or Bitcoin? The question may seem absurd. Yet the question of the social utility of BTC is often at the heart of criticism. But with the same power consumption, is Netflix really more socially useful than Bitcoin?\n\nThe social utility of bitcoin in question\n\nThe question of the social utility of Bitcoin regularly comes up in debates. Is it really worth it considering the energy consumed by the network? The question seems legitimate. But it should also apply to other digital services in our societies. \u201cFor someone who thinks that Bitcoin is a giant casino that just allows speculation, it is certain that Bitcoin will always consume too much energy,\u201d reminds Alexandre Stachtchenko to the media Numerama.\n\nBecause if we consider Bitcoin from the point of view of collective emancipation, it seems at first sight more \u201cuseful\u201d than a streaming entertainment platform. Bitcoin offers a decentralized currency, a bulwark against monetary policies that favor the markets, such as during the 2008 subprime crisis. The banks were bailed out with hundreds of billions (of public money) created via debt. It was this event that precipitated the start of Bitcoin in 2009.\n\nBitcoin was created in response to the excesses of the subprime crisis. Source: Unsplash\n\nFirstly, we have to recognize this: it is very difficult to evaluate the power consumption of services as vast as the Internet, Netflix, Bitcoin, or Google\u2019s online advertising. However, some estimates give us an idea of the energy costs of these digital services. So, streaming consumes energy. A lot of energy. According to the Shift Project \u201cWith 170 million subscribers worldwide, based on a consumption of 2 hours of Netflix per day, the platform represents an electricity consumption of about 94 TWh\u201d.\n\nThe huge consumption of Netflix (and streaming)\n\nHowever, there are other problems specific to streaming. Indeed, this practice encourages people to equip themselves with ever more powerful hardware: smartphones, televisions, processors\u2026 It is a whole industry that is extremely greedy in resources (and not only in energy) that is necessary for streaming. Because in reality, it is the manufacturing of electronic parts and components that consumes the most. And that\u2019s not counting the frantic race for audiovisual productions, the filming and its CO2 emissions\u2026\n\nFrankstream, a dive into the backstage of streaming and its global impact\n\nBut the same criticisms can be made of bitcoin. The network now depends on sophisticated mining devices, requiring high-tech graphics cards. Numerama, reports a study from Cambridge that the consumption of BTC to 95.42 TWh. A figure very close to the consumption of Netflix. However, bitcoin seems to be less energy intensive in terms of everyday use. All you need is an old PC to transfer bitcoins from one address to another. It is even possible to exchange BTC without the internet and without a smartphone, with just a phone. Bitcoin is not naturally high-tech. It does what it was designed to do: provide a secure and incensurable protocol for exchanging value, via the blockchain.\n\nNetflix, a company that seeks profit at all costs\n\nIn a way, Netflix consumers are unwittingly feeding a highly speculative system, which exploits streaming like any other business. As a multinational company, Netflix has to respond to very strong commercial logics. All the more so since its growth has only been made possible by an aggressive growth policy. When it was launched, the service was sold at a loss, at knock-down prices, to attract a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of customers, and by absorbing the competition.\n\nNetflix, a giant in the streaming industry. Source: Unsplash\n\nLittle by little, it was easy for Netflix to gradually increase its prices. The problem is that it must now pay back investors at all costs in order to meet production costs. Nevertheless, Netflix shows its good intentions and assures to take into account its ecological impact:\n\nNetflix exists to entertain the world, and that requires a habitable world to entertain. Which is why environmental sustainability is important to us at Netflix. Official website of Netflix\n\nIf we can congratulate ourselves for such a position, we should not be fooled. Which multinational company can say today that it does not give any importance to its impact on the planet?\n\nBitcoin and Netflix: two opposing models\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, is not a company. No leader or manager can claim ownership. Moreover, it is open source: the source code of the protocol is freely available. All over the world, developers contribute code, discuss, exchange and reach a consensus on the protocol. Some bitcoiners run nodes without any form of compensation, except for contributing to a truly decentralized network.\n\nOne could of course mention the fact that Bitcoin uses a good part of decarbonized energy, that it allows to valorize fatal energy (unused energy), for example by proposing to recover the losses from the methane industry. Or that bitcoin allows countries to finance their infrastructure, as is the case with dams or energy from volcanoes.\n\nBitcoin and Netflix: two opposing models. Source: Unsplash\n\nA sustainable currency?\n\nOne could also find this approach hypocritical, close to greenwashing. In fact, that is not the point. As we have seen, social utility is the argument that wins out. It is not necessarily measured in terms of operating costs, but rather in terms of benefits (difficult to measure), regardless of energy consumption. This is typically the case of the Internet, which is nowadays very little questioned: it is considered as a given, an indispensable basis, despite its far from zero ecological impact. Moreover, the Cambridge researchers behind the study on mining consumption remind us:\n\nBitcoin means many things to many people: some see it as a new store of value [\u2026]; others appreciate the underlying value transfer system that enables both payment and settlement functions [\u2026], resisting censorship; still others are primarily attracted to the incorruptible ledger function made possible by its tamper-resistant public ledger. Therefore, direct comparisons with other seemingly similar activities can only provide a partial, and therefore necessarily incomplete, picture. Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI)\n\nAfter all, one might also think that neither Netflix nor Bitcoin are worth the cost of running them. This is a very technocritical posture, of course, but it can be understood in light of the state of the world, and in particular the collapse of biodiversity and climate disruption linked to human activities.\n\nHowever, bitcoin also invites us to question the monetary functioning of our world. Available in limited quantities, bitcoin is not intended to exist in a world of infinite growth. A design that is the opposite of the euro or the dollar: currencies precisely designed for infinite growth of the economy and production. This is why Bitcoin can also be seen as the currency of degrowth, admittedly imperfect, but which proposes at least a step aside, a fork in the road on the monetary issues that guide the choices of our societies.

        "content": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin HODLers are currently displaying net accumulation behavior, as they grow their holdings by 15,000 BTC per month.\n\nBitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Accumulating Recently\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, these investors were previously aggressively distributing during the bear market lows. The HODLers, or more formally, the \u201clong-term holders\u201d (LTHs), make up a Bitcoin cohort that includes all investors that have been holding onto their coins since at least 155 days ago.\n\nThe LTHs make up one of the two main holder groups in the market; the other cohort is called the \u201cshort-term holder\u201d (STH) group and naturally includes only investors that bought their BTC less than 155 days ago.\n\nStatistically speaking, the longer a holder owns a coin, the less likely they become to sell it at any point. This means that the LTHs are the more resolute bunch of the two groups, which is why they are called the \u201cHODLers\u201d or the diamond hands of the market.\n\nAs these investors are an important part of the sector, their movements can be worth tracking. An indicator called the \u201cHODLer net position change\u201d measures the monthly rate at which these investors are buying or selling a net amount of Bitcoin right now.\n\nThe chart below shows the trend in this metric over the last few years:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have been green in recent months | Source: Glassnode on Twitter\n\nWhen the HODLer net position change has a positive value, it means these investors are receiving inflows into their holdings currently. On the other hand, negative values suggest a net number of coins are exiting the supply of the LTHs.\n\nAs displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin HODLer net position change had a deep red value during the bear market lows that followed the November 2022 FTX crash. This means that the LTHs had been selling during this period.\n\nThis sharp negative spike has been an exception to the long-term trend, however, as the HODLers have actually been showing an overall strong accumulation behavior over the past couple of years. The last time these investors participated in consistent distribution was during the bull rally in the first half of 2021.\n\nFrom the chart, it\u2019s visible that after the aforementioned brief period of distribution at the bear market lows, the LTHs switched back to accumulation just before the current rally began.\n\nThese diamond hands have continued to add to their holdings throughout the rally so far, showing that they haven\u2019t been allured by the profit-taking opportunity. This can be a bullish sign for the long-term sustainability of the rally.\n\nThough, very recently, the monthly amount that they have been adding to their holdings has been trending down. Nonetheless, the indicator\u2019s value still remains positive, as the Bitcoin LTHs are accumulating at a rate of 15,000 BTC per month currently.\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $29,100, up 1% in the last week.\n\nBTC has seen some heavy fluctuations during the past day | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Check out the list of the top 5 Bitcoin alternatives in the crypto space at the moment\n\nEven though Bitcoin isn\u2019t the only cryptocurrency option, the term \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d has almost become synonymous with it. There are several other options to think about if you are already investing in crypto or are considering doing so.\n\nFor those looking for the best cryptocurrencies, let\u2019s take a look at 5 Bitcoin alternatives in the crypto space.\n\nBe that as it may, a note before we make a plunge: digital currencies are incredibly unpredictable and not suggested over different types of ventures like stocks and bonds. But before we get into the best cryptocurrencies, let\u2019s first take a look at what\u2019s going on in the cryptocurrency industry right now if you\u2019re interested in making this high-risk investment.\n\nEthereum (ETH):\n\nSimilar to Bitcoin, Ethereum is an open-source network that is managed by users. It is the second most popular cryptocurrency. Notwithstanding, there are likewise a few huge contrasts. \u201cSmart contracts,\u201d written in computer code and uploaded to the blockchain, are how the network and other cryptocurrency function. Ethereum as of now doesn\u2019t sell as high as Bitcoin, with its value (as of Walk 2023) at US$1,641.82.\n\nRipple (XRP):\n\nAlthough many people like the concept of cryptocurrencies, they are concerned about the safety of their money in an unregulated online environment. Ripple aims to provide a portion of that security. Ripple is a global network that handles money transfers and currency exchange. Ripple, in contrast to the majority of other cryptocurrencies, does not require \u201cmining.\u201d\n\nLitecoin (LTC):\n\nLitecoin is very similar to Bitcoin, but one of its biggest advantages is that it speeds up transactions. Nonetheless, there has been a conversation concerning whether this speed makes Litecoin less secure. As of April 2023, the price of Litecoin is US$89.26, down 78% from its all-time high. The fact that LTC has been around since 2015 and is regarded as stable is one potential advantage of investing in it.\n\nCardano (ADA):\n\nCardano is a blockchain platform based on proof-of-stake. It is intended to be the next generation of the Ethereum network, featuring a scalable platform for running smart contracts and a flexible blockchain. Cardano was introduced as a useful Bitcoin alternative and an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d\n\nBinance Coin (BNB):\n\nThe Binance Coin serves as the medium of exchange for the entire network, making Binance one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. You can utilize your Binance Coin to exchange and pay expenses on the Binance digital money trade. You can likewise utilize BNB on the BNB Chain biological system.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "1. Understand the market conditions and invest in BTC: Bitcoin may appeal as an attractive investment option in the short term and can reach a new all-time high after its halving though it is unlikely to see the same growth as previous cycles due to increased market size and competition from other digital assets including ETH. Analysts believe that the next halving is already 50% priced in and BTC has the potential to reach $40-50,000 by April 2024. Also, the interest from institutional players in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainties has grown leap and bounds. However, a recession can temper the growth leading into the halving while its growth after can still be considerable. A tweet by popular account PlanB summarizes the strategy well \u2013 buy BTC 6 months before the halving (Nov. 2023) and hold for 2 years hence."

        "content": "On Monday, Standard Chartered suggested that Bitcoin may hit $100,000 by the end of 2024 as it emerges from what was commonly referred to as the \"crypto winter.\" According to Geoff Kendrick, the bank's head of digital assets research, several factors could contribute to the increase in Bitcoin's price, including the recent banking sector turmoil, the stabilization of risk assets due to the conclusion of the US Federal Reserve's interest rate hike cycle, and the increased profitability of crypto mining.\n\nAlthough some uncertainties persist, Kendrick believes that the path to the $100,000 mark is becoming clearer. After trillions of dollars were lost in the crypto sector in 2022, Bitcoin has rebounded this year, breaking $30,000 in April for the first time in ten months.\n\nIn the past, there have been numerous predictions of sky-high valuations during Bitcoin's rallies. A Citi analyst predicted in November 2020 that Bitcoin could climb as high as $318,000 by the end of 2022. Last year, however, it closed down about 65 per cent at $16,500.\n\nALSO READ: Why Bitcoin Is Seeing A Surge In 2023. What Investors Should Keep In Mind\n\nIn a note on Monday, Standard Chartered stated that Bitcoin's perceived relative store of value, status as a branded safe haven, and means of remittance have all contributed to its success. Furthermore, Kendrick believes that the European Parliament's recent endorsement of the EU's first set of rules to regulate crypto asset markets will provide a tailwind for Bitcoin.\n\nOn April 5, JPMorgan published a note stating that a technical change to the Bitcoin blockchain, known as its \"halving,\" in April 2024 could increase its price by making it more expensive to produce, resulting in a \"positive psychological effect.\" According to JPMorgan, cryptocurrency prices have already benefited from crypto enthusiasts interpreting the recent US banking crisis as a \"vindication of the crypto ecosystem.\" Stablecoins are thought to be \"less susceptible to runs,\" according to crypto supporters, according to JPMorgan.\n\nEXPLAINED: Crypto Winter: What Is It?

As per CoinMarketCap, a crypto price-tracking platform, the current market value of Bitcoin stands at $28,425.16 (April 26, 2023, 08:40 am IST) and Ether stands at $1,868.09(April 26, 2023, 08:40 am IST).\n\nInitially, both cryptocurrencies were made to store and preserve data in a secure manner. With time, people began to realise that more things could be done with the help of this programmable money. Vitalik Butalin, creator of Ethereum, realised that Bitcoin has limitations and so he created his own crypto Ether (ETH). Eventually, Ethereum opened a new way of working with digital currencies by using the working mechanism of Proof-of-Stake (PoS). In a conversation with FE Blockchain\u2019s Poulami Saha, Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, talks about currently which crypto is better to invest in. (Edited excerpts)\n\nWhat makes Bitcoin popular among other cryptos?\n\nDigital currency was introduced in the \u201990s. By then people already started experimenting with cryptocurrencies. However, in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced us to a digital currency that could provide safety and help solve many other problems. Bitcoin is considered as one of the oldest cryptocurrencies. What makes Bitcoin special is that Satoshi Nakamoto created it and left it for growing organically. Apart from that Bitcoin works in a decentralised manner which might not be easy to hack when it comes to safety. Also, its Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism adds to its security. Moreover, we can say that Bitcoin is popular for its authenticity.\n\nCan the working mechanism of Bitcoin affect its popularity, when it comes to the ability to adapt to changes?\n\nAdaptation to changes may need the involvement of many hands, which might affect the security of these networks. However, Bitcoin\u2019s decentralised working mechanism does not allow such involvement. Since its creation, nothing has changed and no one can control it. Probably, this makes it one of the safest networks in the blockchain. Therefore, Bitcoin has been able to provide some sort of assurance to its users which I guess contributes to its popularity.\n\nEthereum is supposed to be more versatile then why it\u2019s still in the second position?\n\nThe working mechanism of Ethereum which is Proof-of-Stake (PoS) makes it very adaptive to new technologies such as smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps) among others. But Ethereum is also considered just as a security network by many. It is a security network that might fluctuate due to its unknown scalability. However, Bitcoin has become more of a commodity. The users are more comfortable using Bitcoins due to their unchangeable monetary value. It is already known that there are about 21 million Bitcoins and its monetary policy can\u2019t be changed.\n\nWith the adoption of automatic technologies and smart contracts do you think Ethereum will lead the crypto market?\n\nThe future of cryptocurrency is quite unpredictable as crypto is a constantly evolving space and the popularity of these cryptocurrencies depends on the purpose that it is used for. Bitcoin promises strong security and storing values and Ether can be considered as the \u2018Future of the financial system\u2019. Reportedly, the current Shanghai upgradation seems to have contributed to the popularity of Ether. Experts believe that Ethereum with constant upgradation could create an impact in the long run.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn"

        "title": "'Wolf of Wall Street' J. Belfort shares 3 perspectives on Bitcoin's future - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Former stockbroker Jordan Belfort, famously known as the \u201cWolf of Wall Street,\u201d was once skeptical about cryptocurrencies. However, over time, his stance has softened, especially about the future of Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nAs a result, Belfort has made several predictions about Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory for the coming years. In this regard, Finbold has identified the following three key insights shared by Belfort on Bitcoin\u2019s outlook.\n\n#1 Regulations to be bullish for Bitcoin\n\nAt a time when various global jurisdictions have yet to establish concrete regulations for cryptocurrencies, Belfort sees this as a chance for Bitcoin to increase in value. As a long-time proponent for regulations in the crypto sector, Belfort believes that Bitcoin can flourish in an environment where laws are well-defined.\n\nIn this regard, Belfort has criticized market participants who view regulations as a hindrance to the growth of digital assets. He has pointed out that the absence of laws is the primary catalyst behind the proliferation of scams in the digital currency space.\n\n\u201cEveryone said, \u2018Oh no, the regulators are coming in! So I think it\u2019s a good thing\u2026the sooner that massive regulation comes into the market, the better it is for Bitcoin, stablecoins, and everything else,\u201d said Belfort.\n\n#2 Bitcoin is not going to zero\n\nBelfort\u2019s initial view of cryptocurrencies was cautious, as the former stockbroker regarded the sector as fraudulent. According to a Finbold report, Belfort believed that Bitcoin was destined to have zero value due to what he perceived as fraudulent properties of the maiden crypto.\n\nHowever, Belfort changed his mind after witnessing Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence from the crypto winter of 2018. Additionally, incidents like the Terra (LUNA) ecosystem crash further strengthened his faith in Bitcoin\u2019s reliability.\n\n\u201cAt the time that I really hated crypto, I stand by everything I said about crypto in 2017 except for one thing, I was wrong about Bitcoin going to zero, but I didn\u2019t look closely enough because I just said it\u2019s a scam because it just seemed like that because in all the ear markings of that. <\u2026> When it crashed, and it went down to $3,000, it was still like a multi-billion dollar market. I\u2019m like, wait for a second when things crash, they go like Terra that\u2019s what happens when they\u2019re supposed to go the way. That was the first thing that made me start looking closely,\u201d he noted.\n\n#3 Bitcoin to trade higher despite scams and crypto winter\n\nDuring the 2022 crypto winter, Bitcoin experienced a substantial drop in value, further compounded by high-profile incidents such as the Terra crash and the FTX crypto exchange collapse. However, Belfort emphasized that the turmoil in the crypto space should not lead investors to dismiss Bitcoin or Ethereum (ETH).\n\nNotably, Belfort had previously advised investors to focus solely on Bitcoin and Ethereum for their long-term crypto investments.\n\n\u201cBut just because FTX itself was a scam, that doesn\u2019t mean that you can disregard Bitcoin completely and say it\u2019s worthless or going to zero. The same thing goes for Ethereum,\u201d he noted.\n\nDespite Belfort\u2019s optimistic outlook, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that a range of factors, including regulations, adoption, and macroeconomic factors, will influence Bitcoin\u2019s prospects.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "title": "Coincidence? Bitcoin developer visited CIA, then Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Twelve years ago, Gavin Andresen, a former lead Bitcoin (BTC) developer, announced to the cryptocurrency community at the Bitcoin Talk forum that he was going to visit the headquarters of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which coincided with the disappearance of the Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIndeed, after first surfacing in 2008 with the publication of the Bitcoin white paper, Satoshi mysteriously vanished in 2011, at around the same time when Andresen intended to give a presentation about Bitcoin at the CIA headquarters, which he announced in a Bitcoin Talk forum post on April 27, 2011, exactly 12 years ago to this day.\n\nAndresen announces visit to CIA\n\nAccording to Andresen\u2019s post at the time, he had expected that his visit would spark conspiracy theories, which is why he wanted to \u201cget [it] out in the open\u201d that he was going to \u201cgive a presentation about Bitcoin at CIA headquarters in June at an emerging technologies conference for the US intelligence community.\u201d\n\nAs he said at the time, this was a good opportunity to discuss the advantages of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, which he believed would align with the government\u2019s goals:\n\n\u201cI think the goals of this project are to create a better currency, create a more competitive and efficient international payment system, and give people more direct control over their finances. And I don\u2019t think any of those goals are incompatible with the goals of government.\u201d\n\nWith a \u201cfull disclosure,\u201d Andresen revealed he would receive \u201ca one-time fee of $3,000 to cover expenses and pay me for my time,\u201d adding that he was \u201conly very slightly worried that talking about Bitcoin at the CIA will increase the chances they\u2019ll try to do something we don\u2019t want them to do.\u201d\n\nHaving said that, he also voiced his opinion that \u201caccepting their invitation and being open about exactly what Bitcoin is will make it less likely they\u2019ll see it as a threat.\u201d\n\nSatoshi truly gone?\n\nSince 2011, Satoshi has not made any statements or comments in public unless you believe Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist that claims to be him and who has recently accused Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) of copyright infringement over putting Bitcoin white paper in all devices featuring macOS Catalina or later (now removed).\n\nInterestingly, Andresen lost his commit access to Bitcoin Core on GitHub in May 2016 after he publicly backed Wright\u2019s claims that he was Satoshi (though without substantial evidence other than certain \u2018people\u2019 who could prove it). However, he later expressed regret over his involvement in the \u2018who was Satoshi\u2019 game, saying he made \u201ca mistake to trust Craig Wright\u201d in a footnote to his original claims.\n\nMeanwhile, Satoshi\u2019s brainchild, Bitcoin, is changing hands at the price of $28,785, down 3.51% on the day, as well as declining 0.17% across the previous seven days but still holding on to the 5.89% gains accumulated over the past month, as per data retrieved on April 27."
