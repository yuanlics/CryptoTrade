        "title": "Bitcoin climbs above $28,000 as investors shrug off regulatory crackdowns - CNBC",
        "content": "Bitcoin climbed sharply Wednesday as investors shrugged off initial fears surrounding U.S. regulators' crackdowns on industry giants and became willing to take some risk.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency rose 3.9% to $28,399.63, according to Coin Metrics. Bitcoin has retaken the $28,000 level after dipping below it on Monday following news that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission FTC's lawsuit against Binance. Earlier in the day it rose as high as $28,637.25.\n\nEther, the second-biggest digital coin, rose 1.7% to $1,808.29.\n\nBitcoin has been steadily rising this year after a brutal 2022 that saw collapses of major crypto exchanges and a sharp slump in prices. Investors have taken some comfort from the thought of a reversal in the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking moves, which put pressure on risk assets like stocks.\n\nThe reason for the jump Wednesday was not immediately clear. However, it comes amid a broad rise in U.S. stocks. Bitcoin has been known to follow movements in equity markets, with investors treating it like more of a traditional risk asset.\n\nU.S. regulators have sharpened their crackdown on crypto firms of late, with the CFTC suing Binance and its co-founder Changpeng Zhao for allegedly breaking trading rules by courting clients in the U.S. without authorization.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has also threatened to take legal action against Coinbase for alleged violations of securities rules.\n\n\"Broadly we are looking quite bullish here with Bitcoin reclaiming $28K and looking to target $30K next,\" Vijay Ayyar, head of international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC via email Wednesday.\n\n\"In general, when price action starts to absorb negative news this quickly, it indicates that the market is bullish and trending upward. The CFTC case against Binance, while quite important, doesn't seem to have affected the market that much.\"\n\nBitcoin had earlier gotten a boost from woes in the global banking system. Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse was recently rescued by its peer UBS in a government-backed, cut-price deal.\n\nU.S. tech-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank and crypto-oriented banks Silvergate and Signature have also failed.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has sought to cushion the blow of the banking crisis with a lending program known as the Bank Term Funding Program, or BTFP, which aims to help banks meet their obligations to depositors.\n\nProponents of bitcoin say it can serve as a store of value in times of economic distress and a form of money people can access without the need for a bank account.\n\nHowever, it is incredibly volatile and has been known to swing up or down 10% in a matter of hours.\n\n\"The market seems to be placing greater importance on macroeconomic factors and that the Fed has already begun a form of QE, now known as BTFP, but also that the interest rate pivot might happen sooner than later,\" Ayyar told CNBC.\n\n\"Against the bank failure backdrop over the past month or so and bitcoin's rise, this provides the perfect context for bitcoin to continue remaining bullish and move higher.\"\n\nWATCH: Crypto enthusiasts want to remake the internet with \u2018Web3.\u2019 Here\u2019s what that means"

        "content": "Will Bitcoin keep minting more millionaires or is this just a 'dead cat bounce'? Here's why Warren Buffett believes crypto 'will come to a very bad ending'\n\nAre you a fan of roller coaster rides? Have we got the investment for you: Bitcoin.\n\nDon\u2019t miss\n\nThrill-seekers and earnest crypto fans have spent the last few years watching the alternative investment rise and fall \u2014 sometimes with exhilaration and sometimes with that sinking stomach feeling.\n\nAfter hitting an all-time peak of around $69,000 per unit on November 10, 2021, the world's leading digital currency has since erased roughly 60% of its value, sitting at about $26,800 right now.\n\nTo be sure, bitcoin has rallied once again over the last several weeks, up nearly 62% so far in 2023.\n\nBut what would the world's most famous investor say to those who might be thinking of buying Bitcoin right now?\n\n\u201cIf you ... owned all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it,\u201d Warren Buffett told CNBC earlier this year.\n\nOther than Bitcoin's disappointing track record, here are three more reasons Buffett won\u2019t go near it.\n\n1. It has \u2018no unique value at all\u2019\n\nThe billionaire investor doesn\u2019t like Bitcoin because he considers it an unproductive asset.\n\nBuffett has a well-known preference for stocks of corporations whose value \u2014 and cash flow \u2014 come from producing things. But cryptocurrencies don\u2019t have real value, Buffett said in a CNBC interview in 2020.\n\n\u201cThey don't reproduce, they can't mail you a check, they can't do anything, and what you hope is that somebody else comes along and pays you more money for them later on, but then that person's got the problem.\u201d\n\nThough Bitcoin is intended to provide real value as a payment system, that use is still pretty limited. As Buffett sees it, Bitcoin\u2019s value comes from the optimism that someone else will be willing to pay more for it in the future than you\u2019re paying today.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. He doesn\u2019t think crypto counts as money\n\nBuffett has made his share of extremely cutting remarks about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency over the years: \u201cI don't have any Bitcoin. I don't own any cryptocurrency, I never will,\u201d he told CNBC back in 2020.\n\nAs a tradeable asset, Bitcoin boomed. But does it meet the three criteria of money? According to the most common definition, money is supposed to be a means of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account.\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nBut Buffett calls it a \u201cmirage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not meet the test of a currency,\u201d the billionaire said on CNBC in 2014. \u201cIt is not a durable means of exchange, it's not a store of value.\u201d\n\nHe adds that it\u2019s a very effective way of anonymously transmitting money. But: \u201ca check is a way of transmitting money too,\u201d he said. \u201cAre checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money?\u201d\n\n3. He doesn\u2019t understand it\n\nBuffett became one of the most successful investors in history by sticking with stocks he understands.\n\n\"I get in enough trouble with things I think I know something about. Why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don't know anything about?\u201d\n\nBut people like to gamble, he told CNBC after a 2018 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, which is another problem with nonproductive assets.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand it, you get much more excited than if you understand it. You can have anything you want to imagine if you just look at something and say, \u2018that\u2019s magic.\u2019\u201d\n\nHow does Buffett pick winning stocks?\n\nThe billionaire investor follows the value investing strategy \u2014 which focuses on buying undervalued stocks of strong companies and holding them for a long time.\n\nSimple, right?\n\nBerkshire Hathaway looks for companies with a good profit margin and those that produce unique products that can\u2019t easily be substituted. As Warren Buffett once said in a letter to his shareholders, \u201cIt\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\u201d\n\nBut Buffett\u2019s distaste for crypto stocks doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you shouldn\u2019t buy Bitcoin. Even the billionaire has come around on sectors he previously spoke out against.\n\nHe notoriously avoided tech stocks, even at the height of the dot-com bubble, and now his company\u2019s largest holding is Apple.\n\nAlternative alternative investments\n\nWith inflation still sitting at a steep 6.4%, many investors these days are aiming to fight inflation outside of the volatile stock market.\n\nBut if Buffett's wariness has put you off crypto, yet you\u2019re still keen to dip into investments outside of traditional stocks, you have options.\n\nHistorically, alternative investments have been the purview of institutional investors and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. But new platforms are demystifying niche markets and making it easier and cheaper to buy in, especially for non-accredited investors.\n\nThese platforms give retail investors access to a range of private market investments that typically have a low correlation to the stock market, with some requiring a minimum investment of just $500.\n\nThese include luxury vehicle finance, commercial real estate, fine art and even legal finance.\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "content": "Large Bitcoin miners may face new restrictions from the state as Texas tries to protect the state's electric grid from . On Tuesday the Senate Committee on Business and Commerce heard testimony on a bill that would also mandate virtual currency mining shut down during times of a power emergency.\n\noperates a large bitcoin mining operation in a 100-acre . It is such a power user that when electricity is in short supply ERCOT pays them to curtail their operations.\n\nwould ban that kind of arrangement. The bill\u2019s sponsor, State Senator Lois Kolkhorst from Brenham explained, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to produce all this new power. We\u2019re going to have a lot of this new power taken up by virtual currency mining. And then we\u2019re going to pay them to go off the grid at different times, which I believe is a part of their business model.\u201d\n\nSB 1751 would also require large customers to coordinate directly with ERCOT in a power emergency. But other electric providers want the bill go further. Julia Harvey with the Texas Electric Coop told the panel, \u201cWe would further support a provision that requires these facilities to be off during an emergency, so we ensure that they are shed prior to any residential customer.\u201d\n\nALSO |\n\nSB 1751 also seeks to control electricity demand from bitcoin mining by restricting the tax incentives to . \u201cIt bars virtual currency mining from tax abatements given that the large scale of growth in virtual currency mining is already projected to grow in the state,\u201d says Kolkhorst.\n\n\n\nRiot platforms\u2019 bitcoin mining is well established in Rockdale, but they worry the proposal could limit their expansion plans. VP Pierre Rochard says, \u201cThese abatements have helped attract bitcoin miners to Texas and they\u2019ve created hundreds of rural jobs. Bitcoin miners are the number 1 employer in Rockdale. Bitcoin miners are also the number 1 taxpayer to Rockdale ISD. Bitcoin mining is good for rural education.\u201d\n\nThe company recently broke ground on a facility in Corsicana near Dallas, and ERCOT approved it for one gigawatt of power.\n\nThat's even bigger than their operation in Rockdale."

        "title": "What You Must Know Before Investing in Cryptocurrency - Investopedia",
        "content": "When it comes to cryptocurrencies, one of the biggest challenges for investors is not getting caught up in the hype. Digital currencies have quickly risen to prominence in the portfolios of many retail and institutional investors. At the same time, analysts have continued to caution investors about the volatile nature and unpredictability of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIf you\u2019ve decided to invest in the cryptocurrency market, it\u2019s important, as with any other investment, to do your research. Below, we\u2019ll explore what you should know before you invest.\n\nKey Takeaways When it comes to cryptocurrencies, one of the biggest challenges for investors is not getting caught up in the hype.\n\nTake time to learn about the different currencies offered, in addition to researching blockchain technology such as consensus mechanisms.\n\nUnderstanding the differences between a hot and cold wallet; consider investing in both.\n\nThere are many primers on blockchain technology that are accessibly written for the layperson in addition to technical white papers.\n\nAs you begin moving money around networks, perform test transactions to ensure your transfers are successful.\n\n\n\nConsider Why You Are Investing in Cryptocurrency\n\nPerhaps the most fundamental question you should ask yourself before making a cryptocurrency investment is why you\u2019re doing it. There are myriad investment vehicles available, many of which offer greater stability and less risk than digital currencies.\n\nAre you interested simply because of cryptocurrency\u2019s trendiness? Or is there a more compelling reason for an investment in one or more specific digital tokens? Of course, different investors have various personal investment goals, and exploring the cryptocurrency space may make more sense for some individuals than for others.\n\nTo start, begin by taking a comprehensive approach of evaluating your personal risk appetite, investment goals, and portfolio diversification. You may be interested in cryptocurrency as an alternative asset to what you already hold. You may also be interested in potentially higher returns with the understanding that this reward comes with potentially higher risks. Before investing in cryptocurrency, gain a personal understanding of what you hope to achieve as this will help set the course for your actions.\n\nSecure Your Keys\n\nIn cryptocurrency, a private key is a secret alphanumeric code that allows a user to access and control their digital assets. In a way, it's basically just the password that grants ownership and control of the funds associated with a specific cryptocurrency address. Anyone who has access to the private keys of an address has access to all of the funds in that address. This is why it's essential to keep private keys secure and never share them with anyone.\n\nPrivate keys are typically generated by a cryptocurrency wallet, and your keys are automatically generated. It's important to note that if a user loses their private key, they'll lose access to their funds forever. Therefore, it's crucial to keep private keys safe and secure by storing them offline in a cold wallet or using a reputable custodial service.\n\nIn addition, keeping your cryptocurrency on exchanges in a simple way to keep your cryptocurrency liquid and easy to exchange. However, because exchanges technically have access to your keys in this case, you may be more susceptible to losing your funds should the exchange fail or be hacked. Consider solutions to safely storing your private keys such as writing them down using an old fashioned paper and pencil.\n\n\n\nYour keys are a series of words that are virtually impossible for hackers to guess. Never tell anyone your keys, and store them in a safe location.\n\nGet a Feel for the Industry\n\nIt\u2019s essential for investors\u2014particularly those who are new to digital currencies\u2014to develop a sense of how the digital currency world works before investing. Take time to learn about the different currencies offered. With thousands of different coins and tokens available, it\u2019s crucial to look beyond the biggest names like Bitcoin or Ether.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s important to explore blockchain technology to get a sense of how this aspect of the cryptocurrency world works. For example, every blockchain has a consensus protocol to ensure the integrity of the ledger. However, there are different types of consensus protocols. For example, proof-of-work protocols are those that require substantial mining set-ups to validate transactions. Meanwhile, proof-of-stake protocols reward holders with the highest stakes with validation rewards.\n\nUnderstanding different aspects of this may impact your investment. For instance, you may be able to stake your cryptocurrency to generate rewards and increase your holdings. On the other hand, proof-of-stake coins may be inflationary if the rewards given to validators is not closely monitored.\n\nYou can earn passive income from cryptocurrency via staking rewards.\n\nConsider Hot and Cold Wallets\n\nWhen you buy a cryptocurrency, you can store it in a cold wallet or a hot wallet. The main difference between a hot and cold wallet is their level of security and convenience. Hot wallets are convenient for frequent trading and spending of cryptocurrency but are more vulnerable to hacking and theft. Cold wallets are more secure but less convenient for frequent use.\n\n\n\nThe main difference is the connectivity to the wallet. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and can be accessed easily. Examples of hot wallets include online exchanges, mobile wallets, and software wallets. Though hot wallets are great for ease of transacting, hot wallets are also more vulnerable to hacking and theft. If a hacker gains access to your hot wallet, they can potentially steal all your cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nA cold wallet, on the other hand, is not connected to the internet. This type of wallet may be a hardware wallet or paper wallet. Though a cold wallet offers a higher level of security, they are more difficult to transact with. Though they are not vulnerable to online attacks or hacking attempts, it's harder to buy and sell securities from a cold wallet.\n\nAs you embark on your cryptocurrency journey, consider which wallet makes more sense to you. In many cases, investors have both and store more material values or more valuable cryptocurrency via their cold wallet. Then, any balances they may be willing to lose or wish to play with may be kept on the hot wallet.\n\n\n\nRead Cryptocurrency White Papers\n\nMore important than word of mouth, though, are the specifics of a digital currency itself. When you\u2019re considering an investment, take the time to find the project\u2019s white paper. Every cryptocurrency project should have one, and it should be easily accessible (if it\u2019s not, consider that a red flag).\n\nRead the white paper carefully; it should tell you everything about what the developers of the project intend for their work, including a time frame, a general overview, and specifics about the project. If the white paper does not contain data and specific details about the project, that is generally seen as a negative. The white paper is a development team\u2019s chance to lay out the who, what, when, and why of their project. If the white paper feels incomplete or misleading, then it might speak to fundamental issues with the project itself.\n\nIn addition, developers may issue updates to their white paper, especially as it surrounds their development road map. Be wary of projects whose timelines continually shift with minimal progress.\n\nPerform Test Transactions\n\nCryptocurrency is unlike banks in many aspects. One of the most vital reasons to understand this is should you accidently send money to the wrong place, it may be impossible (literally) to recover. In some cases, you may lose your money forever.\n\nAs you join the cryptocurrency world, understand the importance of test transactions. Test transactions are an essential step when sending cryptocurrency because they allow you to confirm that the transaction will be successful before sending a significant amount of funds. Though they result in higher fees, they very well may be worth preventing a large error.\n\nTest transactions involve sending a small amount of cryptocurrency to a test address. It is meant to simulate a real transaction without actually sending funds to another party. This allows you to test the sending and receiving process, confirm that your wallet is working correctly, and ensure that you have the correct address for the recipient. Once the test transaction has successfully been performed, you can copy the same transaction information for larger exchanges.\n\nA test transaction should be a small such as $1.00; once the transaction goes through, you'll know you can send larger amounts.\n\nPatience Is Key\n\nAfter diligent research, you have likely developed a feel for the cryptocurrency industry and may have determined one or more projects in which to invest. The next step is to time your investment. The digital currency world moves quickly and is known for being highly volatile.\n\nRemember that digital currencies are highly speculative. For every overnight bitcoin millionaire, many other investors have poured money into the virtual-token realm only to see that money disappear. Investing in this space means taking a risk. By doing your homework before making an investment, you help give yourself the best chance of success.\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology\u2014a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.\n\nIs Investing In Cryptocurrency a Good Idea? While analysts caution investors about the volatile nature and unpredictability of cryptocurrencies, some investors are willing to take the risk for the potential reward. It\u2019s critical to do your research beforehand to determine if investing in cryptocurrency is right for you.\n\nHow Do I Learn More About Crypto I Want To Buy? To learn more about cryptocurrencies, join an online community of cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts, such as that found on Reddit, to see what the community is discussing. Read the white paper that outlines specific details about the cryptocurrency project that you\u2019re considering. Every project should have an easily accessible white paper\u2014if it\u2019s not, consider that a red flag.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies, one of the biggest challenges for investors is not getting caught up in the hype. Analysts continue to caution investors about the volatile nature and unpredictability of cryptocurrencies. If you\u2019ve decided to invest in the cryptocurrency market, it\u2019s important\u2014same as with any other investment\u2014to do your research. Consider why you\u2019re interested in this particular investment vehicle, and familiarize yourself with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, to be more fully equipped to determine whether this type of investment opportunity is worthwhile for you.\n\n\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

With its continued support for Bitcoin, a digital currency with a large and growing climate impact, the company is undermining its ability to follow through on its climate promises.\n\nTo learn more about Fidelity Investments\u2019 role in Bitcoin\u2019s climate problem, read Greenpeace USA\u2019s Briefing Paper here: Financial Institutions Need to Support a Code Change to Cleanup Bitcoin\n\nRolf Skar, Greenpeace National Campaigns Director said: \u201cWe have tried to engage Fidelity Investments about addressing Bitcoin\u2019s climate impact but they have demonstrated no interest in even talking, much less taking action. That is why we are here. Bitcoin mining requires vast amounts of electricity, contributing to carbon emissions, harming communities, and exacerbating the climate crisis. But this growing problem can be fixed if companies like Fidelity step up to develop solutions that work for people, the climate, and Bitcoin\u2019s future in a warming world.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace USA is urging Fidelity to join the solution by encouraging Bitcoin to change its code to help mitigate the climate impact. Bitcoin\u2019s code relies on a process called Proof of Work to validate transactions on its digital ledger or blockchain which consumes massive amounts of electricity from fossil fuels. Globally, its largest single source of electricity is coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe action comes as part of an ongoing campaign to hold corporations accountable for their role in contributing to the climate crisis through investments in Bitcoin. Greenpeace USA is calling on companies to prioritize climate commitments and to pressure Bitcoin to come up with creative solutions to address its energy intensive code.\n\nContact: Gigi Singh, Greenpeace USA Senior Communications Specialist, [email protected], 631-404-9977\n\nGreenpeace USA is part of a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future. Greenpeace USA is committed to transforming the country\u2019s unjust social, environmental, and economic systems from the ground up to address the climate crisis, advance racial justice, and build an economy that puts people first.

        "title": "Bitcoin price holds its ground in the wake of CFTC case against Binance - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) fell 3.6% to $26,900 after Binance and CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao were sued by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission on March 27. To date, Binance has been investigated by the CFTC, Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and federal prosecutors.\n\nThe Bitcoin price correction may have been limited due to Silicon Valley bank\u2019s successful asset sale to First Citizens BancShares at a $16.5 billion discount, which received an extraordinary credit line from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to compensate for potential future losses.\n\nOil prices also increased by 5% on March 27 after Russian President Vladimir Putin escalated geopolitical tensions in Europe. As reported by Investing.com, Russia plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in neighboring Belarus, in a move designed to intimidate opposing countries over their support for Ukraine.\n\nFurther tension from the crypto industry arose after a U.S. Federal Judge decided to temporarily halt the proposed sale of Voyager Digital to Binance.US. on March 27. Judge Jennifer Rearden of the U.S. District Court in New York granted the request for an emergency stay.\n\nLet\u2019s examine Bitcoin derivatives metrics to determine the current market position of professional traders.\n\nBitcoin futures show no impact from the CFTC\u2013Binance case\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks, which typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement for a longer period.\n\nAs a result, futures contracts on healthy markets should trade at a 5%\u201310% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nThe Binance news had no effect on the Bitcoin futures premium, despite the fact that the exchange holds 33% of the $11.2 billion open interest. The two-month contract premium is 3.5%, which is less than the neutral 5% threshold. Had there been some panic selling using leverage futures contracts, the indicator would have quickly moved to zero or even negative.\n\nThe absence of demand for leverage longs does not necessarily imply a price decline. As a result, traders should investigate Bitcoin\u2019s options markets to learn how whales and market makers value the likelihood of future price movements.\n\nBitcoin options traders remain slightly optimistic\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign showing when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection. In bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 8%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -8%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nBitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nThe 25% skew ratio stands at -5, indicating that the protective put options are trading at a slight discount, confirming the Binance news\u2019 irrelevance. More importantly, the CFTC action had no effect on the 25% skew, so whales and market markets are not pricing in any meaningful market structure change.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin price will hit this key level before $30K, survey says\n\nWhat doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger\n\nThe fact that derivatives indicators were barely impacted could be the \u201cremote misses\u201d effect, as analysis and pundits evaluate the odds of Binance and CZ getting anything more than a million-dollar fine and some term of conduct adjustment.\n\nThis type of psychological distortion was first observed in London during World War II when survivors who did not face imminent losses became even more confident and less likely to feel traumatized.\n\nIt appears unlikely that the market will price in higher odds of extreme volatility until those whales and arbitrage desks face more than a 3.5% price correction.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "When El Salvador President Nayib Bukele made the controversial decision to make Bitcoin legal tender in his country, many people were skeptical and concerned about the potential risks.\n\nBukele announced on Twitter that the country would purchase one Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) each day starting Nov. 18, 2022. How is that going in 2023? The latest news out of El Salvador suggests that the government's bet on cryptocurrency is paying off.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: This Startup Built the World's First AI Marketing Platform That Can Understand Emotion and Some of the Biggest Companies on the Planet Are Already Using It\n\nAccording to Treasury Minister Alejandro Zelaya, the government has successfully repaid one of two outstanding $800 million bonds. This move is likely to allay concerns about a potential default, which had grown amid the country's adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nZalaya announced the news via Twitter on Jan. 23, highlighting the government's commitment to meeting its debt obligations and proving the skeptics wrong. Bukele tweeted, \u201cWell, we just paid in full 800 million dollars plus interest. But of course, almost no one is covering the story.\u201d\n\nThe government still owes $367 million plus interest on an additional bond set to mature in January 2025, but the successful repayment of the 2023 bond is a positive sign for the country's financial stability.\n\nWhat initially started as a largely controversial might be paying off as Bitcoin and many aspects of the blockchain-based asset market have began to rebound. Gamestop Corp.\u2019s NFT marketplace has seen a considerable boom. Some of the top NFT projects on the platform have seen volume spikes as high as 21,446%.\n\nSimilarly, leading NFT marketplace startup Gameflip recently crossed $900,000 raised from retail investors in their active equity crowdfunding raise. This comes after their announcement of hitting $160 million in lifetime volume on the platform earlier this month and a host of other milestones.\n\nBitcoin as Legal Tender\n\nThe small Central American country made headlines in 2021. The legislation required all businesses within the country to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for goods and services, granting it the same status as traditional fiat currencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nChivo Wallet, the wallet created by the government of El Salvador, said 2.2 million Salvadorans were onboarded just one month after Bitcoin became the country\u2019s legal tender. To encourage adoption, every user who successfully downloaded the app immediately received $30 in Bitcoin. By early 2022, about half of Salvadorans had downloaded the app.\n\nSee Next: Qnetic Unveils Revolutionary Flywheel Energy Storage System to Accelerate Renewable Energy Adoption\n\nThe \u201cBitcoin bet\u201d has been met with mixed reactions from international organizations and governments, with many expressing their concerns about potential risks that may arise from the use of cryptocurrency. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently issued a statement on El Salvador's decision to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, cautioning against potential risks associated with such adoption.\n\nAlthough there have not been any significant risks thus far following El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin, they noted it\u2019s important for authorities to be vigilant when providing government exposure to digital assets. According to the statement, crypto markets are still largely speculative and unpredictable in nature and should be approached with caution for El Salvador\u2019s economy to be safeguarded against potential losses.\n\nThe IMF also highlighted the importance of transparency when dealing with cryptocurrency transactions and emphasized that it is crucial for regulators to ensure they remain compliant with anti-money laundering laws and regulations. It advised El Salvador to develop effective regulatory frameworks aimed at mitigating financial stability risks associated with cryptocurrency use.\n\nEl Salvador appears undeterred by the IMF's recommendations. In January, its congress approved a digital securities law, paving the way for the country to raise funds through the issuance of the world's first sovereign blockchain bond. The law allows for the use of blockchain technology in the issuance, trading and clearing of securities, enabling greater efficiency and transparency in the process. The additional step forward for the country could potentially attract investment from tech-savvy investors looking for new opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nTo stay updated with top startup news & investments, sign up for Benzinga\u2019s Startup Investing & Equity Crowdfunding Newsletter\n\nEl Salvadorian Prosperity in a time of uncertainty\n\nWhile the U.S. market faces uncertainty around banking and a general decline in U.S. equities, El Salvador\u2019s bet looks to be paying off. While El Salvador began buying Bitcoin at a significant premium to the current price, they also announced a purchase of 80 Bitcoin at a price around the $19,000 mark in July of 2022. They have also committed to purchasing one Bitcoin per day, every day since November of 2022. At the time, the price of Bitcoin was below $16,000. Roughly 126 days have passed since then meaning the company is still pouring millions into the digital currency despite the controversy, much of which has been at a steep discount to its current price of over $28,000.\n\nSee more on startups investing from Benzinga.\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

He asked the caller where his wife had been summoned and was told 1301 Second Avenue in Conway. The closest Federal courthouse is in Florence. The call was then forwarded to the \u201cFinance Office\u201d for instructions on how to post bail. The \u201cfinance officer\u201d gave instructions to convert a $900 fee into Bitcoin and send them the code. The man told HCSO he asked the caller if he could pay in person at the courthouse, was told no and hung up the phone. A \u201ccaptain\u201d called the man back and said he was considered non-compliant, and the repercussions would be much greater. HCSO said he converted the money to Bitcoin, but before sending the code, listened to my gut and drove to the courthouse. It was there, he learned this was a scam.\n\nChief Deputy Tom Fox says calls like this are more than likely fake as the Sheriff\u2019s Office does not call people regarding jury duty.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t call people and ask for money. We don\u2019t call people and tell people we\u2019re going to arrest them, we knock on their doors if we\u2019re going to arrest somebody.

U.S. equities moved lower on Tuesday on broader worries about interest rates and the economy and as regulators proposed stricter rules on the U.S. banking industry.\n\nSee related article: Asia leads crypto regulations, innovation may leave the US, says Ripple\u2019s Long\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin edged up 1.29% to US$27,290 in the 24 hours to 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, posting a weekly loss of 2.76%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The leading cryptocurrency see-sawed so far this week after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Binance for alleged violation of trading rules. Bitcoin dropped from around US$28,000 to a low of US$26,677 on Tuesday, and bounced back above the US$27,000 mark early Wednesday.\n\nEthereum also regained ground, rising 4.09% to US$1,776, but still down 0.78% for the past seven days.\n\nXRP continued to lead the winners, jumping 10.04% to US$0.5215 for a rise of 12.92% over the seven days. The token continues to gain on expectations that Ripple Labs, whose crypto payment network is powered by XRP, may win a favorable ruling in a lawsuit filed against the company by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC charged Ripple with selling an unregistered security in the form of XRP.\n\n\u201cThe implications for the case are very broad-reaching for the crypto industry because we expect that this decision will ultimately set a precedent for how the U.S. government will look at categorizing crypto assets and regulating them,\u201d Ripple Labs President Monica Long told Forkast.News on Tuesday.\n\nCardano posted the second largest gain among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, jumping 6.68% to US$0.3678, but is still down 1.06% for the week.\n\nAdding to regulatory tensions, a U.S. judge ordered a hold on Binance\u2019s US$1.3 billion acquisition of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital, as requested by the Department of Justice that appealed an earlier court ruling to approve the sale.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 1.80% in the past 24 hours to US$1.15 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours dropped 6.00% to US$39.94 billion.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.34% in the past 24 hours to 4,006.47 as of 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving down 3.26% for the week. The index is a proxy measure of the performance of the global NFT market and includes 500 eligible smart contracts on any given day. It is managed by Forkast sister company, CryptoSlam.\n\nU.S. equities closed lower on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.12%, the S&P 500 edged down 0.16%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.45%.\n\nThe U.S. Congress held a hearing Tuesday on recent bank failures where regulators assured deposits in U.S. banks were safe, but said tighter regulations are required on the banking industry. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday he was confident the problems in the banking system were being resolved, but his administration would offer additional support as needed.\n\nThe U.S. consumer confidence index rose slightly in March, the Conference Board reported on Tuesday, suggesting more optimism in the economy than thought as the expectation was for a decline.\n\nOn inflation, analysts at the CME Group expect a 57.5% chance the Fed will keep rates between 4.75% to 5% at its next meeting on May 3. The chance of another 25 basis-point hike is at 42.5%, up from 41.7% on Tuesday.\n\nU.S. stock futures moved up as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged 0.27% higher, S&P 500 futures rose 0.34% and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.36%. Investors are now waiting for the data about U.S. pending home sales in February, where experts expect a 3% decline from the previous month, according to CNBC on Tuesday.\n\nSee related article: Bankman-Fried charged with paying millions in bribes to Chinese government officials"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) users will soon be able to use zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) to expedite the process of verifying individual blocks and, eventually, the entire blockchain.\n\nZeroSync Association, a Swiss-based nonprofit, is developing tooling which allows users to validate the state of the Bitcoin network without having to download the blockchain or trust a third party for verification.\n\nZeroSync was formed to develop and maintain open-source software that enables succinct ZK-proofs on the Bitcoin blockchain. The group uses StarkWare\u2019s proprietary Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge (zk-STARK) validity proofs to generate ZK-proofs for the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe tool promises to overhaul the process of verifying the Bitcoin blockchain, which still requires node operators to download a large amount of data to synchronize the correct state of the Bitcoin network.\n\nZeroSync is using ZK-proofs to eventually generate valid proof and verify the latest state of the blockchain almost instantaneously.\n\nZK-proofs have been a revelation for the Ethereum ecosystem, with various proof methods powering several layer-2 scaling platforms, including Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism and StarkNet.\n\nRelated: Polygon\u2019s \u2018holy grail\u2019 Ethereum-scaling zkEVM beta hits mainnet\n\nAn announcement from the ZeroSync Association highlights the promise of ZK-proofs for blockchain scalability and privacy by providing \u201calmost-fixed-size\u201d proofs verifying large computations.\n\nThe project\u2019s work pioneers the application of ZK-proofs for the Bitcoin network, with the organization describes Bitcoin\u2019s relative simplicity and the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model as a unique value proposition for applying recursive proofs.\n\nZeroSync notes that the ZK-Proof tools do not require consensus changes or additional trust assumptions for the Bitcoin network and its users. The organization is building a software development kit that will allow developers to generate custom validity proof for specific use cases without needing indepth domain expertise.\n\nZeroSync is in the process of building a client for fast initial block download as well as implementing the first complete proof of Bitcoin consensus. The client will allow users to sync a full node without making code changes to Bitcoin core.\n\nZeroSync is using the Cairo programming language, pioneered by StarkWare, to create STARK-provable programs for computations.\n\nZeroSync\u2019s tool is currently in a prototype state but has the ability to prove the validity of individual assumed valid blocks, which verify all Bitcoin rules except for scripts. The team also has a working in-browser demo verifier for STARK proofs of Bitcoin blocks.\n\nThe ZeroSync Association was initially funded by Geometry and StarkWare but is establishing a nonprofit entity to enable ongoing development and maintenance from stakeholders within the Bitcoin community.\n\nA statement from StarkWare president and co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson, who co-invented zk-STARKS, summed up the magnitude of ZK-proofs coming to the Bitcoin ecosystem:\n\n\u201cAfter years of frustration about slow syncing, users will be able to sync with the network much faster, and with less computation. It\u2019s a technological leap akin to the transition from slow dial-up internet to high-speed broadband.\u201d\n\nLightning Labs, the team behind the Bitcoin layer-2 Lightning Network payment system, is a contributing partner to ZeroSync\u2019s project.\n\nThe firm intends to use ZeroSync to power compressed transaction history proofs for its Taproot Asset Representation Overlay (Taro) protocol, which aims to power the issuance of digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain."

        "content": "An Irish dairy farmer has found an unusual way to make use of the excess energy produced on his farm \u2014 by turning to Bitcoin (BTC) mining. Tom Campbell, who runs a farm in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, produces renewable energy using a method called anaerobic digestion. This involves breaking down biodegradable material to a point where it creates methane gas, which can be used to produce electricity.\n\nCampbell primarily uses the electricity to power his farm, but when there is excess energy that cannot be exported to the grid, he uses it to mine Bitcoin. Mining involves using specialized computers to solve complex mathematical equations, with successful miners rewarded with BTC. Bitcoin mining requires a lot of energy, and Campbell\u2019s farm produces up to 700 kilowatts of electrical output, equivalent to powering nearly 12,000 households.\n\nThe Irish government has set a goal to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030. However, the agricultural sector in Ireland is responsible for over 35% of these emissions, with cows being the primary source. With 7.3 million cows in the country, managing their waste in an eco-friendly manner is crucial. Anaerobic digestion is a promising solution, potentially generating enough electricity for every home in Ireland if 41% of farms adopted the technology. This could make a significant contribution to achieving the country's greenhouse gas emission targets.\n\nCampbell\u2019s decision to mine Bitcoin may seem unusual, but it makes sense from an economic perspective. When grid demand is low, miners can use the excess clean energy. By doing this, Campbell can sell the excess electricity to the grid as renewable, green electricity while profiting from Bitcoin mining.\n\nWhile some farmers have raised concerns that meeting greenhouse gas emission targets could drive them into bankruptcy, Campbell\u2019s approach shows that it is possible to find innovative solutions that benefit both the environment and the farmer\u2019s bottom line. With renewable energy sources such as anaerobic digestion becoming increasingly popular, more farmers could turn to Bitcoin mining in the future to make use of their excess energy.\n\nClick below to watch Campbell\u2019s exclusive interview with Cointelegraph to learn how he\u2019s transforming cow dung into digital gold."

        "content": "Bitcoin mining stocks had a dull performance in March, with small moves here and there that followed BTC's price movement. While it is encouraging to see that most stocks held onto their impressive January gains, Bitcoin's price action will be crucial for the short-to-medium-term performance of these stocks.\n\nAdditionally, the expansion of the public Bitcoin mining sector in the U.S. continues as American miners reported one of the biggest ASIC imports in January 2023. The delivery of new machines and an increase in the Bitcoin (BTC) price led to a surge in the network\u2019s hash rate to new all-time highs. Miners\u2019 incomes, however, were subdued by the rising network difficulty.\n\nMining stocks are in wait-and-see mode\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s recent 18% rally, subdued performances of most mining stocks can be attributed to the uncertainty around the sustainability of Bitcoin\u2019s price rally and the increasing competition in the mining industry. The Hashrate Index, a proxy for Bitcoin mining stocks, increased 10% in March, going from 1,929 to 2,141 points.\n\nThe median monthly gain in the top ten mining stocks is 0.30%, with an average of 5.21%. Riot Platforms and Cipher Mining led the monthly gains across the sector with a 28.64% and 24.34% rise. CleanSpark, Inc. and Bitfarms Ltd. were the worst performers, with negative 6.52% and 5.79% moves.\n\nThe performance of the top ten Bitcoin mining stocks as of March 28.\n\nThe average Q1 2023 gains across the top ten Bitcoin mining stocks is 128%. These shares yielded the majority of their Q1 2023 gains in January. The following months, February and March, saw a muted performance from most mining company stocks.\n\nThe chart of Marathon Digital\u2019s stock perfectly illustrates the price action across the industry, with a tall candle in January, followed by small moves in the next couple of months.\n\nMARA/USD monthly price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nCurrently, mining firms are focused on expanding and sustaining their operations rather than profits. Marathon Digital increased its mining capacity by 30% in February. The firm\u2019s aggressive expansion will increase its production capacity from 9.5 EH/s to 23 EH/s by mid-2023.\n\nAt the same time, Canadian mining firm Hut 8 Mining Corporations announced a merger with the U.S.-based Bitcoin Corp to combine their resources and weather the downturn across the industry.\n\nThe network\u2019s hash rate soared as new ASICs flood the market\n\nThe Bitcoin network\u2019s hash rate increased to an all-time high of 348 exahash per second (EH/s) from 320 EH/s in the last week of March.\n\nThe revenue of miners jumped around 30% after the recent rise in BTC price, increasing from $65 per petahash per sec (PH/s) per day in Q4 2022 to around $85 per PH/s per day in Q1 2023. However, Bitcoin\u2019s price jumped over 60% during the same period.\n\nThe increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price is only part of the reason behind the hash rate surge. The discrepancy in miner incomes can be attributed to the increasing mining difficulty. It was mainly due to the delivery of new machines across America, which increased the network\u2019s processing power and difficulty.\n\nIn January, U.S. miners reportedly imported 1,555 tons of machines, which has propelled the network\u2019s hashrate to its current peak.\n\nRelated: Crypto mining in 2023 \u2014 Is it still worth it? Watch Market Talks\n\nBitcoin monthly estimate of miner shipments and the network\u2019s hashrate. Source: TheMinerMag\n\nThe rise in the network\u2019s hash rate has limited the revenue of miners, which may adversely affect miners\u2019 incomes if BTC prices were to fall from here.\n\nThere\u2019s a probability that the network\u2019s hashrate could plateau around current levels. The MinerMag report added:\n\n\"If there\u2019s no major uptick in the shipment gross weight in the rest of March and into April, the growth rate of bitcoin\u2019s network hashrate may gradually slow down.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price performance will continue to play a significant role in the growth of the mining sector, but BTC price must sustain its current level or move higher for positive revenues and a continued uptrend in public stocks.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Stabolut Launches New Bitcoin-backed, Decentralized Stablecoin, USDB - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Introducing a dollar-pegged, Bitcoin backed stablecoin, built without dependencies on banks. Becoming available on a private beta starting today, USDB, a stablecoin that has been built in a revolutionary approach that will reroute the crypto markets unlocking new opportunities for fast and simple trades to power exchanges, financial institutions, businesses, developers, and users.\n\nHONG KONG, March 29, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stabolut, a startup that is building a completely new worldwide payments ecosystem and the issuer of the USDB, today announced that it has just launched a fully decentralized, dollar-pegged stablecoin called USDB. Available as of today, March 29th, 2023, USDB is a stablecoin issued under a groundbreaking model that\u2019s built on decentralized pillars of trustless infrastructure and security that have made Bitcoin the world\u2019s most trusted and reliable cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n\n\nUSDB enters a very hot market, as stablecoins total 140 billion in capitalization, which is currently expected to grow to at least 1 trillion. Simultaneously, opinion leaders in crypto have been asking for a truly decentralized and privacy preserving stablecoin that everyone in the industry can trust, set up with verified and audited assets and invulnerable to shut downs.\n\n\u201cStabolut is setting the new industry leading standards for moving financial value across the internet and crypto markets with USDB,\u201d said Eneko Knorr, co-founder and CEO of Stabolut. \u201cThere\u2019s clear market demand from users for a reliable stablecoin choice, given the collapse of UST -Terra Luna\u2019s stablecoin-, as well as witnessing the recent instability caused by the de-pegging of USDC following the recent bank failures we\u2019ve seen this year. With USDB, Stabolut is helping to unlock a new era of transparent privacy-preserving, fast, inexpensive, secure and interoperable exchange across the globe.\u201d said Julian Beltran, co-founder and CTO of Stabolut.\n\nFor a truly decentralized economy, a decentralized currency is essential. In May 2022, Stabolut embarked on the development of USDB, a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin designed to reflect the value of the US Dollar through an innovative method: shorting Bitcoin via a Bitcoin inverse perpetual swap. Asset-backed USDB eliminates the need for bank accounts, ensuring immunity from crackdowns or frozen funds, and bolstering complete privacy and resilience. Fiat-backed stablecoins face centralization and regulatory hurdles, limiting access and innovation while increasing counterparty risk and reducing user privacy. USDB\u2019s approach aligns with Bitmex co-founder Arthur Hayes' Nakadollar (NUSD) concept.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOur solution addresses the limitations of fiat-backed stablecoins, which suffer from centralization and regulatory challenges. By mitigating counterparty risks and enhancing user privacy, we aim to expand accessibility and foster innovation in the stablecoin market.\u201d said Eneko Knorr.\n\nUSDB will power cross chain transactions and inter-chain exports across all the ecosystems and beyond, providing users and exchanges with a global stablecoin where they can take their power back from the western financial system and interact with their money on their own terms no matter where or who they are. USDB will work broadly with Bitcoin compatible wallets, protocols, and other blockchain services.\n\nTo learn more about the USDB stablecoin, visit the Stabolut website.\n\nAbout Stabolut:\n\nStabolut is a company that is building a complete ecosystem for payments around the globe. Started by serial entrepreneurs with a broad experience in tech and crypto, Stabolut is the issuer of the USDB stablecoin, a digital currency that is poised to solve all the issues and concerns other stablecoins have, with a clear goal to become one of the most widely used stablecoins. Stabolut received funding from the co-founders of Dextools.io, an ecosystem with 30 million monthly visits that allows traders to track information about all the decentralized markets.

        "title": "Mysterious entity may be collecting BTC users' IP addresses \u2014 Bitcoin developer - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "An unknown person or group may be collecting the IP addresses of Bitcoin (BTC) users and linking them to their BTC addresses, violating the privacy of these users, according to a blog post from pseudonymous Bitcoin app developer 0xB10C. The entity has been active since March 2018, and its IP addresses have shown up on several public posts from Bitcoin node operators over the past several years.\n\n0xB10C is the developer of several Bitcoin analytics websites, including Mempool.observer and Transactionfee.info. They have also been awarded a Bitcoin developer grant from Brink.dev in the past.\n\nAn entity I call LinkingLion, active since 2018 and on a Monero banlist, is opening connections to many clearnet Bitcoin nodes. Its presumably attempting to link transactions to node IPs. Maybe a chain analysis company trying to enhance its product?https://t.co/W4PDoln3p3 \u2014 0xB10C (@0xB10C) March 28, 2023\n\n0xB10C calls the entity \u201cLinkingLion\u201d because the IP addresses associated with it pass through LionLink network\u2019s colocation data center. However, ARIN and RIPE registry information reveal that this company is probably not the originator of the messages, according to 0xB10C.\n\nThe entity uses a range of 812 different IP addresses to open connections with Bitcoin full nodes that are visible on the network (also called \u201clistening nodes\u201d). Once it opens a connection, the entity asks the node which version of the Bitcoin software it is using. However, when the node responds with a version number and message stating that it has understood the request, the entity closes its connection about 85% of the time without responding.\n\nAccording to the post, this behavior may indicate that the entity is trying to determine if a particular node can be reached at a particular IP address.\n\nWhile this behavior isn\u2019t necessarily a cause for concern, it\u2019s what the entity does the other 15% of the time that may be a concern. 0xB10C stated that about 15% of the time, LinkingLion doesn\u2019t close the connection immediately. Instead, they either listen for inventory messages that contain transactions or send a request for an address and listen for both inventory and address messages. They then close the connection within 10 minutes.\n\nThis behavior would normally indicate that the user is a node trying to update its copy of the blockchain. However, LinkingLion never requests blocks or transactions, which implies that they must be pursuing some other purpose, the post said.\n\nRelated: Zero-knowledge proofs are coming to Bitcoin\n\n0xB10C stated that LinkingLion might be recording the timing of transactions to determine which node first received a transaction, information that can then be used to determine the IP address associated with a particular Bitcoin address. The developer explained:\n\n\u201cConnections that complete the version handshake and stay connected learn about our node\u2019s inventory, like transactions and blocks. The timing information, i.e., when a node announces its new inventory, is especially relevant. The entity is likely to first learns about our new wallet transaction from us. As the entity is connected to many listening nodes, it can use that information to link broadcast transactions to IP addresses.\u201d\n\nTo help protect the community from this privacy threat, 0xB10C has produced an open-source ban list that nodes can implement to ban LinkingLion from connecting to them. However, they also warned that the entity could get around this ban list by changing the IP addresses it uses to connect. In 0xB10C\u2019s view, the only permanent solution to the problem is to change the transaction logic within Bitcoin Core, which developers have so far been unable to do.\n\nIn a conversation with Cointelegraph, 0xB10C stated that the vulnerability doesn't just affect users who run their own nodes. Even users who rely on a third-party server through a wallet like Electrum or Mycelium can still be victims of this invasion of privacy.\n\n\"When using Electrum wallet, you connect to a remote Electrum server. You tell the server which addresses you are interested in and, when you send a transaction, you tell the server about the transaction. This is all linked to your IP address if you don't use Tor or similar,\" they said. \"All LinkingLion has to do is to run public Electrum servers and get people to connect to it. This has been suspected to be happening for years and it has been recommended to run your Electrum server connected to your own node.\"\n\nPrivacy has been a continuing concern for Bitcoin and crypto users over the years. Although Bitcoin addresses are pseudonymous, their transaction histories are entirely public. Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonopoulos has argued that Bitcoin will never be truly private. But Breeze Wallet has attempted to improve privacy on the network by utilizing offchain transactions and cryptographic puzzles.\n\nThis article was updated on March 30 with a comment from 0xB10C regarding users who don't run their own nodes."

        "content": "00:00\n\nIt speaks to the broader question out there right now, and thank you so much for joining us about after these collapses where crypto companies go to bank, is that still possible in the US? Well, look, regulators have certainly made it more difficult for of native companies to get access to banking. There are other regional banks that are stepping in selectively to fill the void. But the system is much less supportive than it used to be, and many are on the sidelines just waiting to see what happens. The fears around finance are also not helping, and many users are likely moving coins off the exchange and into cold storage was probably explains the lower volume these days. Well, speaking of things, moving is the end result of this just moving off shore. Is that something that digital is pursuing? Well, it's funny you ask. We actually that our entire fleet used to be in China. And we decided to move our entire fleet from China to the United States because we felt that it was just too much jurisdictional risk to stay in China and ask we're moving our fleet midway through. China announced a ban on bitcoin mining. So we just accelerated that entire movement of the fleet into the United States, into the United States, which we felt was a safer place. So we continue to see that the pattern continues. You know, China had a go on bitcoin. Nothing happened. Bitcoin is not something you can destroy. It's a decentralized asset. Banning an entire industry does nothing to Bitcoin. It has no effect. I mean, but we are looking at other jurisdictions now, other countries. And we have to part of our jurisdictional diversification to diversify our risk forces us to look at other countries. Is it possible to get to know jurisdiction? Because it seems like that's what financial is trying to do. And it feels like that's where Bitcoin really belongs, but it doesn't seem possible with all of these governments working together. Look, we're pro regulation, but we want regulation to be well communicated and it can't just be simply carried out by enforcement on ambiguous rules. Bitcoin mining, for example, comprises a point two percent of global energy use and over 60 percent of that is sustainable. But politicians are unfairly painting the entire industry as some sort of dirty energy and are threatening these unwieldy taxes and outright bans. Forcing bitcoin mining out of the United States would simply transport the industry elsewhere. And it would just decrease the US's ability to pollute to be a powerhouse in this new industry. That's not going away. Well, you know, a lot of times people are terrified of things they can't understand. Sam, let me ask you about the price action we've seen, because it's been pretty impressive. You know, even after the collapse of RTX, even with the threat right now, although it's only a civil threat, we want to remind our viewers to buy an ounce, not a criminal threat. Nonetheless, it's not a great look. We still have Bitcoin trading at twenty seven thousand dollars. Is that because of low liquidity? I mean, somebody still has to lift the offer. How do you explain the price action? Yeah. Well, the loss of Silver Gate's exchange network and signatures Signet has certainly reduced the liquidity as market makers use these banks for 24/7 settlement. So there is a technical reason for the volume. However, there is also a logical reason why bitcoin is going up, and that's because Satoshi is thesis about the financial system having too much control and just can censor transactions and just having as you could see, banks are falling apart again. That happened in 2008. That is exactly when Satoshi invented bitcoin because he saw that the financial system had way too many holes and there he wanted to create a system where it was completely decentralized and foolproof. Bitcoin is a fail proof system. And so he invented that in the last banking crisis. And here we are again, another banking crisis. You'll see Bitcoin going up. Eventually, Bitcoin will be seen by a lot of people as digital gold. It's the ultimate way to hedge against macro bets, inflation and this sort of thing that's happening today. Well, and just like gold, it has to be mined. So one final question on Bitcoin miners, many of which we have seen come into pretty serious financial trouble. All right. Is the Bitcoin mining industry through the worst of it? What challenges do you still face? I agree with you. A lot of our peers, unfortunately, drank their their own Kool-Aid and and levered up and took on debt on their balance sheet while Bitcoin was going up through the roof. I think past fifty thousand people were really getting greedy. We did not we did no such thing. We have a very healthy, pristine balance sheet. We have over sixty five dollars on the balance sheet. We have absolutely no debt, but digital has no leverage, no capital commitments. So we ran a pretty conservative and tight ship and we're even in the business of potentially even lending to people in the industry who need the money because we have such a great balance sheet. Having said that, this is a lesson to be learned in the future for there will be another bull run. And you know, the industry needs to to run a business and run a business means you can't just hope on the direction of Bitcoin. You've got to run your business regardless of the direction of where bitcoin is going. All right, so what we do."

It\u2019s why the phrase \u201ccrypto winter\u201d has become a top discussion among investors.\n\nWhile a bear market has scared away many individual investors and financial institutions, others are now laying the groundwork for the next bull run.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: This Startup Built the World's First AI Marketing Platform That Can Understand Emotion and Some of the Biggest Companies on the Planet Are Already Using It\n\nTwo of the world\u2019s largest and most respected financial institutions \u2014 BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments \u2014 recently dove headfirst into the cryptocurrency world. And with a combined $14 trillion in assets under management, it\u2019s something to pay close attention to.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Larry Fink Excited About The Future\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink shared his excitement about the future of cryptocurrency and digital assets as a whole.\n\n\u201cAt BlackRock we continue to explore the digital assets ecosystem, especially areas most relevant to our clients such as permissioned blockchains and tokenization of stocks and bonds,\u201d Fink wrote.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time BlackRock and Fink have made their intention clear about their involvement in the blockchain and emerging technology space. In 2022, BlackRock partnered with Coinbase to provide its institutional clients with access to Bitcoin. That was a bold move for an investment company with the size and reach of BlackRock, but it\u2019s been a welcome addition.\n\nTo stay updated with top startup news & investments, sign up for Benzinga\u2019s Startup Investing & Equity Crowdfunding Newsletter\n\nFidelity Joining The Crypto Revolution\n\nEarlier this month, Fidelity Crypto made its way to the public, allowing tens of millions of its retail customers to buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Adding to the excitement is the fact that all Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions on the app are commission-free.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget this: The investment manager filed three U.S. trademark applications at the end of 2022. The applications made mention of crypto trading, metaverse investment services, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and virtual real estate investing. All of these areas are primed for hypergrowth in 2023 and beyond.\n\nWhen companies like BlackRock and Fidelity take a step into the future \u2014 such as going all-in on cryptocurrency and digital assets \u2014 it\u2019s important to take notice. No one knows when the next crypto bull run will arrive, but when it does it\u2019s safe to say that BlackRock and Fidelity will be in a position to take full advantage.\n\nBanking Collapses as a Catalyst\n\nThe collapse of various regional banks has created a rebound in blockchain-based assets. While they are still off their all-time highs, they are considerably higher than their 2022 lows. The price of Bitcoin has rallied for several weeks now. Gamestop\u2019s NFT marketplace has seen a volume rebound and retail investors have begun increased funding of startups in the space. For example, Gameflip recently crossed $900,000 raised from retail investors in their current equity crowdfunding raise. While institutions previously might have been skeptical of blockchain-based assets, institutional interest might be rebounding following the lack of stability in the banking system, as institutions look for liquid places to store their cash.\n\nSee more on startups investing from Benzinga.\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

        "content": "Are cryptocurrencies commodities or securities? Depends on which US agency you ask Both the CFTC and SEC view bitcoin as a commodity for now, though\n\nIt\u2019s a confusing time to be a crypto company. The markets are volatile and trading activity is shaky right now, but the biggest problem for crypto firms seems to be that there\u2019s no clarity at the moment around the laws they\u2019re supposed to be in alignment with.\n\nTake, for instance, what the U.S. Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) considers crypto to be: In its lawsuit against the crypto exchange Binance and its CEO, the CFTC alleged the firm violated trading and derivative rules, and referred to the two largest cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ether, as commodities.\n\nPer the CFTC\u2019s filing against Binance, the regulator said certain digital assets, including bitcoin, ether, litecoin and \u201cat least two fiat-backed stablecoins,\u201d tether and the Binance USD, \u201cas well as other virtual currencies as alleged herein, are \u2018commodities.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe complaint also alleged that Binance and the respective parties charged \u201csolicited and accepted orders, accepted property to margin and operated a facility for the trading of futures, options, swaps and leveraged retail commodity transactions involving digital assets that are commodities.\u201d\n\nThis stance is \u201ca significant issue if the same company [and] exchange is sued by multiple agencies for the same tokens,\u201d Yankun Guo, partner at Chicago-based law firm Ice Miller, told TechCrunch+. \u201cThis stand is also a stark contrast to the position taken by the SEC and possibly weakens the SEC\u2019s argument that the tokens are securities.\u201d\n\nThe CFTC\u2019s viewpoint diverges from another major U.S. government agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which views most crypto assets (aside from Bitcoin) as securities.\n\nEarlier this month, SEC Chair Gary Gensler told Bloomberg that the crypto market, while smaller than capital markets, is \u201cnot necessarily compliant\u201d compared to traditional finance.\n\nAt the SEC, there\u2019s \u201cone goal,\u201d Gensler said: \u201cFor them to come into compliance. [\u2026] They can call themselves crypto exchanges or lending or staking as a service or other intermediaries. [Our goal is for them] to come into compliance and ensure that they don\u2019t mislead the public or commingle the funds or take the publics\u2019 funds and do things we don\u2019t allow in our financial markets.\u201d\n\nGensler compared it to how the SEC doesn\u2019t allow the New York Stock Exchange to play with customers\u2019 funds, make markets, run hedge funds or be in the clearing business. \u201cWe separate out those conflicts,\u201d he added.\n\nThe CFTC and SEC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nSo are cryptocurrencies commodities or securities? Well, it depends on who you ask. As someone who\u2019s been covering this space, I can empathize with firms offering crypto trading on this, as it feels wishy-washy. Almost like if your mom told you one thing, but your dad told you another. Who are you going to listen to?\n\nFor there to be fewer lawsuits, charges and so forth, there needs to be a concise stance from both agencies, but truth be told, I think that\u2019s unlikely for quite some time, given how slowly regulators in the U.S. move. It\u2019s a sticky position for companies to be in.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happening in the United States, overall, we are in an unprecedented situation,\u201d said Jason Allegrante, chief legal and compliance officer at Fireblocks, a digital asset custody platform. \u201cA picture is emerging where every major prudential and markets regulator in the U.S. is coming out with enforcement against crypto businesses.\u201d\n\nJust last week, the SEC announced charges against Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, alleging he orchestrated \u201cunregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.\u201d\n\nThe SEC said it was suing Sun, the Tron foundation, the BitTorrent Foundation and BitTorrent (now referred to as Rainberry) over the sale of two tokens: TRON, or TRX, and BitTorrent, or BTT. Both TRX and BTT were referred to as unregistered crypto asset securities by the SEC, further fueling the debate on whether cryptocurrencies are, in fact, securities.\n\nThis lawsuit also came around the same time the SEC issued a Wells notice to Coinbase.\n\nIn response to the announcement, Coinbase executives took to Twitter Spaces on Thursday to discuss the decision.\n\n\u201cI think it is easy to look at the situation right now and conclude that the SEC is trying to change the game,\u201d Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, said during the Twitter chat. \u201cWhat\u2019s actually happening is the SEC is trying to cancel the game after it\u2019s been played. And so we think it\u2019s very important to keep a focus on what this means [longer term for Coinbase and the industry].\u201d\n\nIn the Coinbase filing on Wednesday, SEC language appeared to indicate that staking through a third-party service can run afoul of securities law. But the Coinbase Wells notice, alongside charges on crypto companies from the SEC and other agencies alike, may lead to more regulatory confusion if the agencies don\u2019t coincide on what is a security, commodity or neither.\n\n\u201cFor crypto, this is the worst of both worlds: one company with an SEC allegation, Coinbase, and one with a CFTC allegation, Binance,\u201d Allegrante said. \u201cHow are we supposed to understand what rules do or do not apply? With unclear regulation coming from two different sides, I\u2019m not sure how people are supposed to figure out what set to comply with, if it\u2019s possible to receive banking services, or if it\u2019s possible to have a crypto bank.\u201d\n\nUntil the agencies make clear decisions together, waters will continue to rise.\n\n\u201cThere is growing tension around how the CFTC and SEC are classifying certain tokens,\u201d Guo said. There are also fears that, in the future, companies could use the legal interpretations of one agency against the other. For example, stating the SEC has \u201cno authority to regulate in this area because crypto is a commodity per the CFTC,\u201d Guo added.\n\nThe CFTC affirming that these cryptocurrencies are commodities also creates greater tension and room for arguments that the agencies are contradicting one another, according to Jeffrey Blockinger, chief legal counsel for decentralized exchange Vertex Protocol.\n\n\u201cIt feels like the CFTC is strategically undercutting Chairman Gensler, which is unprecedented, at least, as far as I can recall,\u201d Blockinger said. \u201cMore importantly, though, the CFTC\u2019s position supports those of us who have been calling on Congress to exercise their responsibility to settle this interagency dispute through legislation.\u201d\n\nThis further makes the point that indecision and infighting within the federal government are discouraging innovation, Blockinger said.\n\n\u201cRegulatory agencies should not be competing against each other; they should be working together to create a collaborative framework that fosters innovation and protects investors,\u201d he added. \u201cWe clearly need the clarity that everyone is asking for. By the time it comes, the U.S. may very well be left behind.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin ATMs Hacked, Millions in Crypto Stolen as Threat Actors Exploit an Upload Vulnerability - CPO Magazine",
        "content": "A vulnerability in the interface that General Bytes bitcoin ATMs use to upload videos was found and exploited by thieves, leading to the theft of at least $1.5 million in crypto from user accounts.\n\nGeneral Bytes has over 15,000 of these bitcoin ATMs in circulation in over 100 countries, recognizable by their yellow face plates or touch screens with a \u201cBitcoin ATM\u201d logo across the bottom. The final amount of stolen crypto is still being tallied as investigations continue, but about 56 BTC has been confirmed taken from 15 operators in total.\n\nUpload interface flaw allows attackers to steal private keys from bitcoin ATMs\n\nBitcoin ATMs replicate some of the functionality of traditional bank ATMs, allowing users to \u201cwithdraw\u201d funds by selling some of their crypto on the spot via an exchange at whatever the current market rate is. It is less clear why these bitcoin ATMs might have a video upload function, but it is possibly due to some sort of planned marketing feature.\n\nWhatever the case, the attackers were able to exploit this feature to upload malicious JavaScript code. The attackers targeted bitcoin ATMs running on Digital Ocean, the cloud hosting provider that General Bytes recommends to ATM buyers (standalone management is also an option). They were able to intercept the API private keys that secure \u201chot\u201d crypto wallets online, in turn gaining the ability to disable two-factor authentication, change exchange passwords and raid accounts for their funds.\n\nA statement from General Bytes appeared to pass the buck for the crypto theft to individual owners of bitcoin ATMs that were exploited, saying that the ATM servers are meant to be behind a firewall and VPN to be protected from attacks and that only operators that were not using a VPN were impacted. General Bytes instructed all ATM owners to only connect the kiosks to the internet via a VPN, and also said that it is issuing a security fix.\n\nThe company also said that it was still investigating the incident and did not have final numbers in terms of crypto theft amounts, but that at least 56 BTC was stolen (about $1.5 million) from the total of at least 15 operators that were hit. However, other forms of crypto were also stolen in the attacks, so this tally is extremely likely to increase before this incident is wrapped up.\n\nJason Kent, Hacker in Residence for Cequence Security, notes that theft of API keys is a more general trend and has become a focal point for hackers: \u201cAs you can see, APIs have once again played a part in a massive successful attack. Why? Well, if one has an API Key for a coin trading platform, especially a privileged one like an ATM service would use, the attacker now owns the system. The overall target for this breach was to get control of the wallets and move coins. The pivot from attacking to withdrawing occurred once they had the API Keys they needed. As Kerckhoff teaches, the most important thing is how the key is handled, everything within a secure crypto system can be known \u2013 except the key. Persistent keys, even if encrypted, should be avoided. API Keys often persist far too long and grant far too many privileges.\u201d\n\nCrypto weaknesses emerge in new and untested technologies\n\nWhether it is decentralized finance or bitcoin ATMs, the biggest vulnerabilities in the crypto space seem to be emerging in relatively new technologies that have not yet been proven stable. Platforms and services often learn their lessons by suffering thefts of multiple millions of dollars.\n\nIn this case, the lesson General Bytes seems to be taking is that bitcoin ATMs cannot be properly secured via cloud services. It has since issued a statement saying that it is shuttering this option, requiring ATM owners going forward to set up standalone management to connect their kiosks to the internet. The company says that it will provide technical support to ATM owners who will need to migrate their servers, including setting up firewalls and VPNs.\n\nThis is also not the first serious security incident in recent history for General Bytes, or the first to involve bitcoin ATMs being exploited by a zero-day. In August 2022 an attacker compromised the company\u2019s Crypto Application Server (CAS) and created an admin account that in turn routed transactions at two-way ATMs to their own wallet.\n\nManufactured in Prague, the General Bytes bitcoin ATMs support over 60 types of crypto. One feature that they do not have, and that is not yet supported by the industry at large, is the ability to interface with more secure \u201ccold\u201d wallets. The closest compromise is the use of a \u201cpaper wallet,\u201d supported by some ATM types, which allows users to generate a QR code from their own wallet which can then be scanned at an ATM. Paper wallets create their own security hazard, however, are private keys are generally printed on one side.\n\nThis particular incident seems as if it would have been readily avoided by having a system in place to ensure that uploads through the video system were in fact videos before being accepted; crypto consumers are likely left wondering if other bitcoin ATM brands also have this sort of \u201cfeature\u201d hidden in them. It also raises questions about the overall value of these machines, given that they generally cost the user anywhere from 7% to a whopping 20% in transaction fees.\n\nNick Percoco, Chief Security Officer of Kraken, notes that bitcoin ATMs are not the only option for funds access: \u201cIncidents like this reinforce the importance of promptly addressing attack vectors. Kraken Security Labs identified several hardware, software and backend vulnerabilities in General Bytes ATMs as early as 2021. We hope those impacted are not deterred from continuing their journey in the crypto ecosystem. For those continuing to access Bitcoin via retail outlets, we recommend transacting via trusted vendors. There are trusted alternatives to ATMs worth considering, such as digital asset trading platforms, that also provide secure access points to the crypto asset class.\u201d"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network may be inching closer toward mainstream adoption, as LDK\u2014one of the main implementations of the network\u2014sets forth on an ambitious new roadmap to improve functionality and accessibility for users.\n\nLightning Development Kit, also known as LDK, is a project from Bitcoin open-source development entity Spiral, which is funded by Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block. LDK plays a significant role on Bitcoin's Lightning Network, and the project\u2019s team recently showcased tech improvements during a Twitter Spaces that they plan to work on over the next year.\n\nIt\u2019s significant given the belief among Bitcoin supporters that if anything takes Bitcoin mainstream, it'll be the Lightning Network, which makes payments cheaper, faster, and more scalable. But though the Lightning Network is functional, it's rough around the edges and is not always easy for new users to send payments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor one, there\u2019s a difference between custodial and non-custodial mobile Lightning wallets. Custodial wallets require the user to trust the wallet provider with the funds, while non-custodial wallets give wallets sole control over their own funds.\n\n\u201cThe Lightning Network is a pretty good user experience today for custodial Lightning Network wallets. However, there remain substantial problems with UX, privacy, and scaling for non-custodial Lightning wallets,\u201d Spiral lead Steve Lee told Decrypt.\n\nThe LDK roadmap, compiled of a number of features, aims to tackle this problem\u2014with the goal of making the Lightning Network more appealing to mainstream users.\n\n2023 Lightning Development Kit. Source: LDK\n\nBitcoin UX improvements\n\nLDK is different from LND and C-lightning, the most-used software implementations of the Lightning Network. The LDK team aims to be more modular and flexible to make developers' lives easier when building (particularly mobile) Lightning wallets and apps. And there are two features on the roadmap, in particular, that are unique to LDK.\n\nThough LDK isn't a node per se, developers can build custom Lightning nodes that suit their needs with it. But the freedom LDK provides is too intimidating for developers who are newer to building on the network, Lee noted in the Twitter spaces.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA key feature on the roadmap is LDK Node Mobile, which offers an easier set-up for creating a node. Nodes are a key piece of any Lightning app. They connect the app to the rest of the network, allowing users to send and receive payments. Instead of it taking developers days or weeks to build a node with LDK, Lee argues LDK Node will shrink down this time to hours.\n\nAnother unique feature LDK is working on is what's called \"async payments.\" One of the irritating problems mobile users of Lightning face is if they try to send a mobile payment to a friend, the friend needs to be online to receive the payment, otherwise the payment will fail. Hovering over a phone to wait for a payment sort of defeats the purpose of Lightning-speed payments. Users don't have to deal with this issue when sending a Venmo payment, so why the need with Bitcoin?\n\nSpiral developer and long-time Bitcoin contributor Matt Corallo released a proposal for dodging this problem in 2021. And as the LDK roadmap shows, putting async payments into practice is a chief focus for the LDK team over the next year.\n\nLightning's decentralized future\n\nThen there's a slew of other changes LDK developers are working on that will boost usability of the payment system. If you've been following the whirlwind of Bitcoin and Lightning Network development, you might have heard of some of them, since other implementations are also adopting these changes to make them more widespread.\n\nLDK is working on adopting BOLT 12, a proposal for making it easier to invoice and accept Lightning payments. It's a mishmash of features with uncomfortably technical names (like \"onion messages\" and \"blinded paths\"). But the short of it is that BOLT 12 will allow for a better user experience where users can reuse Lightning invoices to accept payments. BOLT 12 also boosts privacy. With \u201cblinded paths\u201d a user can accept payments without revealing their identity. Normally, the sender knows the public key, which is the identity of the node they are sending a payment to. But with blinded paths, this information is shielded.\n\nAnother big win is coming support for privacy feature Taproot. In 2021, Taproot was Bitcoin's largest upgrade in years. Slowly, the effects of Taproot are rippling out to Bitcoin projects like Lightning. Taproot will shield Lightning transactions, giving them invisibility so that they look exactly the same as normal Bitcoin transactions. If you look on a block explorer to see all Bitcoin transactions ever made, Lightning transactions usually stand out, since they use a technique called \u201cmulti-sig.\u201d This can typically be detected since the data will look more complicated than a normal Bitcoin transaction.\n\nThat\u2019s just scratching the surface of the roadmap. \u201cThere is no doubt it is an ambitious roadmap,\u201d Lee told Decrypt, noting that time estimates for development projects can be \u201ctricky.\u201d But it provides an accurate window into what Lightning Network developers will be working on in the near-term.\n\nLightning developers have plenty of work ahead of them. Improvements to the network are as sprawling as the network itself. But with every change they make a piece is put into place to transform Bitcoin into an easier to use payment system.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nTexas-based Bitcoin mining companies may soon be without the financial incentives that have let the industry gain a strong competitive advantage in the Lone Star State.\n\nIntroduced earlier this month, Senate Bill 1751 seeks to protect the state\u2019s electric grid during peak loads, with one proposed measure being the utility-scale.\n\nA key provision of the bill is that it would restrict Bitcoin mining companies from participating in a state-run demand response program. This program rewards miners for giving power back to the grid when demand threatens to overwhelm the system unless the anticipated demand for electricity \u201cis less than 10 percent of the total load required by all loads in the program,\u201d the bill reads.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bill would also bar \"virtual currency mining from tax abatements given that the large scale of growth in virtual currency mining is already projected to occur in the state,\u201d said the bill\u2019s sponsor Senator Lois Kolkhorst during Tuesday's testimony, adding that there\u2019s no need to subsidize that growth.\n\nThe Texas senator insisted that the bill is not a \u201cpunitive\u201d one, but rather \u201crightsizes for the industry\u201d that doesn\u2019t need that kind of assistance.\n\nSharing portions of his speech made during the same testimony with Decrypt, U.S. Blockchain Corp.'s chief commercial officer Matt Prusak said that his firm understands \"that the goal of SB1751 is to ensure the responsible growth of the bitcoin mining industry in Texas. While we share this goal, we believe that the current proposal may have unintended consequences that could negatively impact both the mining sector and the broader energy market.\"\n\nRiot Blockchain, one of the largest Texas-based Bitcoin mining companies that recently rebranded to Riot Platforms, has been a large beneficiary of the current incentives in Texas. Last Summer, it earned as much as $9.5 million in power credits after suspending operations during the heatwave.\n\nRiot\u2019s Rockdale Bitcoin mining facility, which is believed to be one of the largest in North America, has a total power capacity of 750 MW. The firm has also kicked off development for a large-scale 1 gigawatt (GW) development to expand its Bitcoin mining and hosting capabilities in Navarro County, with the initial 400 MW of capacity expected to begin in July 2023.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBitcoin miners' electricity use grows\n\nAccording to a recent Reuters report citing the Texas Blockchain Council president Lee Bratcher, Texas-based Bitcoin miners currently consume about 2,100 megawatts of the state's power supplies, up 75% over the last year.\n\nMoreover, the latest power usage metric was almost triple that of the prior year, said Bratcher.\n\nData by ERCOT also shows that the Texas Bitcoin mining industry\u2019s power demand accounts for nearly 3.7% of the state\u2019s lowest forecast peak load this year.\n\nThose opposing the bill and taking part in the testimony included the Texas Blockchain Council president Lee Bratcher and the organization\u2019s director of Business Development Kristine Cranley, as well as Riot\u2019s VP Pierre Rochard.\n\nIn Austin today testifying in the Senate Business and Commerce Committee to ensure Texas remains a place for innovation, business expansion and prosperity!

        "content": "Cointelegraph has released Episode 8 of its Crypto Trading Secrets podcast, featuring an interview with trader, investor, podcaster and YouTuber Chris Dunn, who touts experience in mainstream markets as well as about 10 years of activity in the crypto space. The trader and investor answered questions asked by host Benjamin Pirus during the episode\u2019s March 14 recording, giving his opinions on the role Bitcoin (BTC) plays as an asset and why he thinks people are willing to buy the coin, plus much more.\n\nDunn mentioned that he thinks COVID-19 got mainstream, non-crypto folks to ponder the United States money system, including questioning how the government can create trillions of dollars and whether or not to trust the U.S. dollar.\n\n\u201cThen kind of the second thing is, okay, we\u2019ve got some bank failures happening right now. We\u2019ve got inflation going through the roof, and people are getting squeezed,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nOver the course of 2022, inflation hit significant levels across the globe. In March 2023, Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Bank all went under. These three players all had involvement in the crypto sector. Dunn explained:\n\n\u201cMillennials and younger are going, \u2018Hey, I make a good income, I work really hard, but why can\u2019t I afford the average house in my town or city?\u2019 and \u2018What happened there, and what can I do to build my wealth? How can I beat this inflation monster?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where Bitcoin comes in. At least so far, it\u2019s proven to just really have a great compound annual growth rate,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cIt\u2019s outpaced inflation really, really well,\u201d he continued. \u201cWill that happen into the future? That\u2019s yet to be seen, but it\u2019s proven itself so far over the past decade-plus to be a great store of wealth, even taking into consideration the depths of the bear markets.\u201d He added:\n\n\u201cAdjusted for volatility, Bitcoin is still one of the best-performing assets on the planet. So, I think people are waking up to the idea that maybe fiat isn\u2019t the best form of money and maybe there is a better way to store our wealth.\u201d\n\nSince its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has increased in price from less than $1,000 to more than $65,000 per coin at its peak, but it has also suffered dramatic drawdowns. In 2017, BTC increased in price from around $1,000 all the way to nearly $20,000 \u2014 and then plummeted down below $5,000 in 2018. It then surged past $65,000 in 2021 before falling back below $20,000 in 2022, according to Cointelegraph\u2019s Bitcoin price index. This type of turbulence makes the question of whether or not it\u2019s a store of value a point of argument, given that buying at the wrong time could lead to significant losses.\n\nDunn also gave his take on a number of other questions during the episode and talked about his background.\n\nCheck out this and other episodes from Cointelegraph\u2019s Crypto Trading Secrets podcast on Cointelegraph\u2019s podcast page, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts or TuneIn.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

        "title": "Africa: The next hub for Bitcoin, crypto adoption and venture capital? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency space has no shortage of skeptics. While many people criticize the environmental impact of proof-of-work blockchains or the proliferation of scams, one particular argument against crypto often stands out: Blockchain has no real use cases.\n\nEvery two weeks, Cointelegraph\u2019s The Agenda podcast breaks down this critique and explores the various ways blockchain and crypto can help everyday people.\n\nOn this week\u2019s episode of The Agenda, hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond chat with Elisha Owusu Akyaw, Cointelegraph\u2019s own social media specialist and host of the Hashing It Out podcast, to break down how Africans are using crypto to strengthen financial inclusivity and potentially turn countries into hubs of technological innovation.\n\nHow crypto is helping everyday Africans\n\nAccording to Akyaw, crypto offers a more convenient, affordable way to send money both regionally and around the world. \u201cWestern Union, MoneyGram and all of these money transaction firms or rails have made millions from Africa for so long\u201d by charging high fees, said Akyaw, whereas the cost required to send money via crypto is significantly lower.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) also offers a better store of value for most Africans than local fiat currencies, Akyaw argued. Speaking on his own experience of living in Ghana, he said that \u201cyou can buy Bitcoin and keep it for the next one year or six months. It\u2019s a better hedge against inflation than keeping the Ghanaian cedi.\u201d\n\nFinally, the crypto industry is opening up new opportunities on the continent. \u201cAt every point of development, Africa has been left behind,\u201d said Akyaw. But the global nature of the industry and the fact that it\u2019s still in its early development present a unique opportunity to participate and benefit from its growth.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the first times where there is a big shift happening and Africans are able to contribute. Africans are able to benefit directly from the shift that is happening without it having to pass through an intermediary, which is usually the state. And I think it\u2019s an amazing thing.\u201d\n\nThe next Silicon Valley?\n\nWhen asked about what it would take for countries in Africa to become \u201cmagnets for crypto builders or a new kind of Silicon Valley,\u201d Akyaw pointed to two factors that need to be improved for developers, startups and fintech companies to want to make the continent their home: regulation and infrastructure.\n\nUmm. So I met @jack at the @AfroBitcoinOrg Conference.\n\n\n\nI have been smiling since pic.twitter.com/SJKjkU6nAb \u2014 Elisha | GhCryptoGuy (@ghcryptoguy) December 5, 2022\n\nThe majority of African countries lack proper regulation, according to Akyaw, while also condemning the use of crypto. This means companies are often unable to obtain licenses to set up shop and residents are dissuaded from interacting with Web3 protocols and firms:\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get a license. You can\u2019t work with a bank in the country. You can\u2019t do a lot of things. So, it makes no sense for you to come in.\u201d\n\nThe other thing that needs to change, said Akyaw, is that electric grids need to be more stable and internet needs to be more reliable. \u201cIf you want a lot of Big Tech companies to come in, they must have great, 24/7 electricity. Internet must be awesome because a lot of what we do in the crypto space is virtual.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Akyaw\u2019s conversation with The Agenda \u2014 including his backstory, whether outside funding has any negatives and the potential near-term future of crypto in Africa \u2014 listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph\u2019s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

        "content": "The crypto market fell in the wake of the CFTC\u2019s action against Binance. Meanwhile, the market faces a liquidity crisis triggered by the shutdown of Silvergate\u2019s SEN and Signature\u2019s Signet network in early March. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s happening in the market.\n\nBitcoin Liquidity at 10-Month Low\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s stellar performance this year, investors may still be wary due to its low market liquidity. An indicator tracking the ease of buying and selling Bitcoin has dropped, hitting a low not seen in the past ten months.\n\nEvaluating the buy and sell orders in the market maker\u2019s order books, with a 2% maximum deviation from the token price on either side, is crucial in calculating this metric.\n\nBesides, the drop in market liquidity can be traced to a lack of dollar-payment methods available to firms dealing in cryptocurrency trading.\n\nWith market observers on high alert for further repercussions or turmoil, the ebb in liquidity has happened as Silvergate Capital Corp. and Signature Bank, which had close ties to the crypto industry, collapsed in recent weeks. These financiers had provided banking services to many digital asset companies, and exchanges had used them for real-time transfers, among other things.\n\nInvestors are on tenterhooks as they await the fate of Bitcoin\n\nNonetheless, even though the market has proven resilient in the past, the current liquidity crisis poses a serious threat to its stability. It\u2019s unclear whether the current Bitcoin momentum will last or give in to the turmoil.\n\nMoreover, low liquidity in financial markets tends to result in high volatility, which can impact prices in both directions. It is because prices have reduced support both on the downside and the upside.\n\nThe post-FTX decline in volume, or the \u201cAlameda Gap,\u201d illuminates how crypto market liquidity vanished in the absence of one of the major digital asset market movers. Following the Silvergate and Signature banking crises, which cut off market makers from vital USD payment rails, that liquidity gap has not recovered and keeps falling to new lows.\n\nFortunately for investors, a surge in purchase demand brought on by the banking confidence crisis has driven the price up. However, the absence of support on the upswing also holds true on the downside, so we must be equally wary of an oversized move downward in the upcoming weeks.\n\nBinance Hit With $218 Million Outflow Amid CFTC Legal Action\n\nThere have been accounts of sizable capital outflows following the news of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) lawsuit against Binance, the leading CEX. Since the CFTC announced the legal action, there have allegedly been withdrawals of $218 million from the exchange.\n\nMoreover, users have expressed worry after the CFTC charged Binance with breaking U.S. trading and derivatives regulations.\n\nThe market frequently experiences token withdrawals, which can be a standard component of the ebb and flow of trading activity. However, the timing of these withdrawals is notable as it relates to the proceedings surrounding the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s lawsuit and the legal steps taken against the CEX.\n\nRegarding inflows, Binance has noticed a rise in deposit activity in certain areas like Asia. It appears that some users are taking advantage of the market volatility by buying tokens at reduced prices while others are withdrawing their funds from the exchange.\n\nEthereum: Is It a Security or a Commodity?\n\nBinance was charged on March 27 by the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) for breaking federal laws. Notably, the governing authority asserted that Ethereum is also a commodity in its case.\n\nThis lawsuit occurred weeks after the Securities and Exchange Commission closed down Kraken\u2019s crypto-staking service, wherein they classified ETH as a security.\n\nThe conflicting opinions on whether Ethereum belongs in the category of a security or a commodity are to blame for the industry\u2019s lack of regulatory clarification.\n\nThis incident is not the first; earlier this year, SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the CFTC Chair reaffirmed that ETH should be treated like a commodity.\n\nAccording to their definition, \u201csecurity\u201d is a financial commodity or instrument with a worth that can be purchased, sold, or traded. Stocks, investments, etc. are examples of the same. Contrarily, a \u201ccommodity\u201d is a tangible product exchanged on exchanges whose worth is based on supply and demand.\n\nSince staking is a necessary component of using Ethereum, it falls more into security than a commodity. On the other hand, Bitcoin, which has financial similarities to gold, is more akin to a commodity than a security.\n\nHowever, if Ethereum is deemed a \u201csecurity,\u201d it will affect the platforms that intend to list it. These platforms and exchanges must file with the SEC as a \u201csecurities\u201d broker-dealer or delist ETH to avoid trading securities illegally. As a result, it would affect both centralized trades and decentralized exchanges.\n\nFurthermore, this development could further shake the already dwindling trust in exchanges.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nOn March 27, users transferred their ETH to self-custody wallets or staked it, dropping the Ethereum volume on exchanges to just 10.3%. It is the lowest supply level since the cryptocurrency\u2019s inception in 2015.\n\nMoreover, the collapse of FTX has left ETH holders\u2019 trust in these exchanges unsettled, resulting in a decrease in the amount of ETH held by exchanges to below 12.5 million ETH ($25.4 billion).\n\nBattle for Stablecoin Dominance Heats Up\n\nAs the war for stablecoin shares rages on, which stablecoin will prevail, USDT with a 44.60% market capitalization or USDC with a 43.78%?\n\nThe fall of the USDC stablecoin is one of the repercussions of the banking crisis in the United States, which is at its height right now. Its market capitalization declined by 7.06%, while the USDT stablecoin grew by 6.2%.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nBesides, the \u201cold money\u201d USDT currently has a greater chance of winning the battle for the leading global stablecoin. We should support market rivalry in general, but a secure stablecoin is what we need.\n\nIn Web3, stablecoins are digital assets pegged to the value of fiat money or other commodities like gold or oil. Compared to other cryptos, which are subject to substantial market price changes, stablecoins are more stable.\n\nThe two stablecoins currently most in demand are USDC and USDT. Both stablecoins enjoy a sizable portion of the cryptocurrency market valuation, indicating strong investor demand.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nCurrently, USDT has a slight edge over USDC because it is not losing market capitalization share. However, there are benefits to USDC as well, such as increased operational transparency and frequent financial statement audits.\n\nIn any case, the rivalry between these two stablecoins is advantageous for the cryptocurrency market as it encourages product improvement and higher user security standards among developers.\n\nThe stablecoin race may thus go on for a very long time, but eventually, the winner will be the one who offers the finest product tailored to the market\u2019s needs.\n\nWhales Exiting?\n\nAnalysis of Bitcoin addresses by their holdings reveals a notable trend: smaller investors are increasingly accumulating while the number of more prominent investors, or \u201cwhales,\u201d is declining. This trend appears to have accelerated following the recent collapse of FTX, which has seen a sharp drop in the number of whales holding over 1,000 BTC.\n\nMoreover, the decline in whale numbers suggests that these investors seek to diversify their holdings across multiple custodians and addresses or are considering exiting the Bitcoin market altogether.\n\nSource: Galaxy Research\n\nIn contrast, smaller investors with 10 BTC or fewer holdings have consistently accumulated approximately 30,000 BTC per month, exceeding the network\u2019s issuance of around 900 BTC/day.\n\nThis data suggests that smaller investors are becoming a significant force in the Bitcoin market, accumulating a growing share of the crypto and potentially exerting a more substantial influence on its price trajectory.\n\nTradFi Worries Drive $160m Inflows to Crypto\n\nFor the first time since July 2022, investments in digital asset assets saw inflows totaling US$160 million. After US$408 million in withdrawals over the previous six weeks, this is a dramatic reversal. Nevertheless, compared to the overall crypto market, the inflows arrived relatively late; this might be because investors are growing more concerned about the stability of the traditional financial sector.\n\n\n\nSource: CoinShares\n\nMoreover, the fact that the deposits came from numerous nations suggests a general upsurge in the positive outlook for the asset class. The most significant outflows, totaling US$69 million, US$58 million, and US$26 million, respectively, were from the U.S., Germany, and Canada.\n\nMoney is pouring into money market funds as investors worry about the security of the financial system and as tighter monetary policies are causing liquidity woes for banks in the United States and Europe. Due to their high liquidity and low risk, money market funds are popular among investors during economic instability. These funds are currently offering some of the best returns in years due to the consistent interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve to combat inflation.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Realized Price and Market Dynamics\n\nRealized Price represents the average cost base of all bitcoins in circulation. Its calculation involves dividing the worth of all bitcoins at the purchase price by the total number of bitcoins in circulation. The concept of Realized Price is founded on the notion that each UTXO is valued at the price it was last moved between wallets.\n\nDuring bull markets, the Realized Price of Bitcoin usually rises because buyers who purchase tokens at greater prices are more prevalent. The average price per coin increases in a parabolic fashion until Bitcoin reaches all-time highs. As soon as this occurs, the Realized Price usually forms a flat plateau.\n\nDuring bear markets, the Realized Price may marginally fall. For instance, the Realized Price declined from its December 2021 value of $24,500 to lower levels (gradually from levels around $24,500 to levels below $20,000) during the most recent bear market in January 2023.\n\nThe cause for this decline is that long-term holders acquire Bitcoin at reduced rates, which lowers the Realized Price (LTH realized price). Besides, the Realized Price of Bitcoin reached its lowest point of the bear market during the recent 25% drop in Bitcoin\u2019s market price, which occurred this month and brought its value to $19,800.\n\nSource: CryptoQuant\n\nMoreover, the high demand pressure on Bitcoin led to massive accumulation as its price dipped below $20,000, which caused the Realized Price to reach $19,700, indicating a turning point.\n\nAn inflection point in the Realized Price usually marks the shift from a bear market to a bull market. Due to rising demand, there is a good chance that the Realized Price of Bitcoin will surpass the $20,000 mark and return to its ATH values.\n\nBitcoin the New Safe Haven?\n\nIn the past few months, the correlation between Bitcoin and equities has decreased after remaining at an elevated level for 18 months. Notably, since the onset of the banking crisis, Bitcoin\u2019s correlation to equities has dropped, while its correlation to gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, has significantly increased. This trend suggests that, at least in recent times, Bitcoin has been behaving more like a safe-haven asset than a high-risk asset.\n\nSource: Galaxy Research\n\nSource: Galaxy Research\n\nWith the current crisis testing the limitations of the fractional reserve banking system, Bitcoin\u2019s fundamental characteristics can offer a safe haven for investors if custody or self-custody is appropriately managed. These correlation data demonstrate that Bitcoin has unique properties that can differentiate it as a safe port in a storm.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f For more cryptocurrency news, check out the Altcoin Buzz YouTube channel.\n\n\u2b06\ufe0f Our popular Altcoin Buzz Access group generates tons of alpha for our subscribers.

        "title": "Difference between Bitcoin software, network, and protocol - CoinGeek",
        "content": "Something that people don\u2019t normally consider: when someone says \u201cBSV\u201d or \u201cBTC\u201d what is it that you think of? Is it the coin which is traded on an exchange? Is it the platform, upon which people develop blockchain applications? Is it the peer-to-peer network of nodes? Or is it the software that runs said nodes?\n\nWell if you are not sure, then rest-assured you are probably part of the vast majority. It is the hope of this article to clear some of this up, as the \u2018crypto\u2019 industry is rife with many misunderstandings and misdirections, of which this is one of the most common. After we have cleared up the differences between these, I wish to turn to the issue of chain splits (sometimes called \u2018forks\u2019), which may occur when the nodes of the network do not come to majority consensus on what the ledger state should be. Why is this relevant? Well, as we all know, chain splits are very disruptive to blockchains, leading to splitting of the developer community, and battles over which side gets to keep the standing token ticker symbol. Why is understanding chain splits important? Well, because as blockchains in general become integrated into the common law of society, we need to arm ourselves with the knowledge on how the implementation of law will affect the operations of blockchains.\n\nUp until this point, the narrative that has been pandered is that blockchains, due to their decentralized nature, live completely supra-legal, and outside of the reach and understanding of common laws. This cannot be further from the truth, as given enough time, laws has a way of catching up with whatever technology or society can invent. There were no airline safety laws before the time of the Wright brothers, nor were there laws against using radioactive radium in toothpaste at the turn of the century, but would it have been reasonable for scientists to argue that laws surrounding the harm done by invisible forces such as radiation poisoning could never be devised? Well by that same reasoning crypto proponents have been claiming for years that laws could never be enforced against a decentralized network such as those employed by blockchains\u2026 and people to this day still believe it. And this is relevant and topical considering the upcoming clash between the \u2018common wisdom\u2019 of crypto and the law in the cases surrounding Craig Wright\u2019s claim for his stolen bitcoins. But first, let\u2019s clear up some terminology.\n\nWhat is BSV, BTC?\n\nBSV is a ticker symbol that represents a protocol, and the Bitcoin SV node is simply software for a node which is compatible with that protocol. Similarly BTC is a protocol, and BTC-Core is node software that adheres to the BTC protocol. Of the protocols, BSV is the closest to the original Bitcoin protocol as described in the original Bitcoin white paper, as it does not include any of the changes that were pushed into the BTC or BCH protocols in order to support different higher layer protocols and platforms1 such as Lightning Network. The BSV protocol function by function is closest to what Bitcoin was in 2009. With that understanding, Bitcoin SV is just what happens to be the most prevalent node software available presently, but it is by no means the only one. In fact, there are several other node softwares available for those who do not wish to use the official version, including ones implemented in Go, Rust, and an upcoming one called Teranode, which promises to be able to process terabyte sized blocks. No matter the node software you run, however, as long as it adheres to the open protocol of BSV, BTC, or BCH, your node will remain in sync or \u2018in consensus\u2019 with other nodes that run on that protocol.\n\nSeen in this light, chain splits are just a simple matter of some servers falling out of consensus with each other, and not being able to follow the chain. If they fail to upgrade their software to the version that the miners (henceforth referred to as \u2018block producers\u2019) are running, then they simply never receive any new blocks, and to them, the blockchain will have essentially stopped. They may see plenty of transactions and traffic on their network, but blocks will simply never come. Listening-only nodes have no ability to cause a chain or ledger to split. They have no power whatsoever, as they are listen-only.\n\nA chain split is when the block producing nodes don\u2019t all agree on the rules. When a significant proportion of the producing nodes are running incompatible software, with incompatible protocol rulesets, then a potential for chain split exists. This is what happened twice in the past\u2014first, when BTC split away from Bitcoin with the introduction of the \u2018SegWit\u2019 change, and then later, when BCH introduced a change to enable tokens which the majority did not accept. In each of these past splits, the protocol which remained the closest to the original ruleset had to change the ticker symbol of their token, due to the fact that the exchanges where tokens were traded were confused over which of the token ledgers would use the existing ticker symbol, and which would be given a new one. However, generally speaking a chain split is unlikely (because it is costly2) to result when a majority of the block producers are in agreement with which version of the node software they will run, and therefore which ruleset they will support.\n\nFrom the perspective software, BSV, BTC, and BCH node software is simply a set of protocol rules to follow, and different block producers running different software will result in seeing different versions of the ledger. The effect of this is that with every ledger split, a new token is created3 or \u201cairdropped.\u201d This is how the current situation came to be, with 3 major tokens all claiming to be Bitcoin. But it is only upon the examination of the protocol and ruleset that they enforce that one can start to form an opinion of which is the closest match to what \u2018bitcoin\u2019 truly is. Contrary to popular belief, it is not necessarily the ledger token that the exchanges have decided to award the legacy ticker symbol to. The exchanges, after all, do not get to decide what a product is.\n\nTherefore, if \u2018bitcoin\u2019 is just a protocol, and not the network, or a coin, then the BSV node is just the version of software that you run, and what software you run determines what version of the ledger you see. What this means is when the time comes for law enforcement to effect the freezing of coins, whether it be to stop the proceeds of criminal activity or to recover lost funds, all that is required is for a majority of block producing nodes to be running the version of software that will honor the confiscation of frozen coins. And given that any sort of confiscation transaction cannot be created unless a majority of block producers agree on the status of the coins in question, there will be nary a chance for a chain split. The current method for effecting the freezing and re-issuance of coins by court order while implemented only in the BSV node software, was written to be compatible with BTC node software, so it is conceivable that block producers could contract developers to patch the BTC node software with the necessary changes in order to comply with the asset recovery process. Whether or not authorities will be able to compel a majority of the block producers to upgrade their software, will be a different matter, and an issue that will be played out in the real world, and not on the blockchain. But that, is for the lawyers to worry about. Not the technologists, or the users.\n\nJerry Chan\n\nWallStreetTechnologist\n\n***\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Arguably because they were tooted as a solution to the false \u2018scaling problem\u2019 of bitcoin, which BSV solved simply by reverting to the original bitcoin rules.\n\n[2] in order to support a chain split, the minority side must constantly burn cash in producing blocks which may have no future value, perpetually.\n\n[3] although which is the new token and which is the old token is indeterminate and up for endless pointless debate.\n\nWatch: Here\u2019s how Bitcoin works as a base layer for other blockchains\n\nwidth=\"562\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to blockchain?

The rally was partly fueled by a weaker dollar as well as a rise in both liquidity and volatility seems to have run out of steam.\n\nAs the fallout from the banking turmoil continued to roil markets BTCUSD reached a 9-month high as market participants could have viewed bitcoin and cryptocurrency as an alternative to cash storage. This would come as somewhat of a surprise given last year's public failure of FTX as well as the ongoing scrutiny of the crypto industry, particularly in the US. Hard wallet crypto storage does however have a sense of appeal and mitigates such risks in these somewhat uncertain times and crypto prices seem to have benefitted.\n\nTrade Smarter - Sign up for the DailyFX Newsletter Receive timely and compelling market commentary from the DailyFX team Subscribe to Newsletter\n\nJPMorgan bank said the US banking crisis has opened up opportunities to increase market share for those exchanges offering banking services. Whether adoption will be smooth and swift though remains to be seen given some of the public scandals in 2022 and increased regulatory scrutiny. Nasdaq has also announced its plans to launch cryptocurrency storage services by the end of Q2 2023. Whether these developments will support crypto and bitcoin prices in the months to come remains up for debate.\n\nBreaking news just a while ago regarding Binance the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, and its CEO Changpeng Zhao were sued by the US CFTC for allegedly breaking trading and derivative rules. This could further weigh on prices as more information is released on the matter supporting the narrative of lower prices in BTCUSD.\n\nTECHNICAL OUTLOOK\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Bitcoin has been in a state of consolidation for the best part of 10 days since breaking above the $28000 mark. On the 4H chart below we can see the triangle pattern in play with a break and candle close below the triangle likely opening up a retest of the 100-day and 200-day MAs resting at $26000 and $24400 respectively. Given that we are currently breaking out with a bit of momentum a retest of the triangle breakout may be the smarter play and provide a better risk-to-reward opportunity for potential shorts.\n\nChanges in risk sentiment may play a role on any potential move and may be something to keep an eye on. The Banking sector turmoil remains far from over while geopolitical risks have reared their head over the weekend and could propel BTCUSD higher if they do escalate.\n\nBTC/USD Four-Hour Chart \u2013 March 27, 2023\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nRecommended by Zain Vawda The Fundamentals of Breakout Trading Get My Guide\n\nWritten by: Zain Vawda, Market Writer for DailyFX.com\n\nContact and follow Zain on Twitter: @zvawda"

        "title": "Crypto heaven! As Bitcoin price skyrockets, bulls eye $51,000 mark - HT Tech",
        "content": "Bitcoin price rally over the last few days has bulls once again eyeing levels the coin hasn't seen since the start of the year. The largest cryptocurrency by market value rose nearly 4% at one point Monday, reaching $47,881. That's its highest level since the start of the year and the propulsion rounds out its year-to-date gains to around 3%. Elsewhere, the MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 100 index -- which tracks tracks the performance of some of the largest digital assets -- was up more than 5% as of 12:04 p.m. in New York.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies had been, up until the last few weeks, mired in a similar downtrend as other riskier assets, like U.S. stocks. But a weekend rally above $45,000, a key level watched by chartists, helped garner momentum for a bigger breakout. The coin has added 15% over the past week.\n\n\u201cIt's been a choppy start to the year, not just for crypto, but across all asset classes. So I think certainly, it's an exciting morning in the crypto community to see that year-long, so far, of losses erased, and also seeing Bitcoin break out above that psychological $45,000 level,\u201d Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. He added that \u201cwhat we're seeing is a couple of native crypto buyers like Terra buying for their own reserves,\u201d which could help support prices.\n\nDo Kwon, the co-founder and chief executive officer of the firm behind the Terra blockchain, confirmed that it has purchased more than $1 billion in Bitcoin since the end of January, Bloomberg News reported on Monday. Analysts are also pointing to other developments for the renewed optimism around crypto, with some citing comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who said in a March 25 interview with CNBC that despite her own skepticism about the asset class, \u201cthere are benefits from crypto and we recognize that innovation in the payment system can be a healthy thing.\u201d\n\nThe rally has brought Bitcoin into technically overbought levels, based on its Relative Strength Index (RSI) score of 71. Assets are considered overbought if its RSI crosses above 70 and oversold if it falls below 30. Overbought levels tend to bring out projections for a short-term breather, though strategists at Bespoke Investment Group say it's not always been the case that those conditions lead to a downturn and can instead portend further gains.\n\nMatt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., says he's looking at Bitcoin's 200-day moving average, which is currently around $48,270 -- that could provide some short-term resistance. But beyond that, chartists will be focused on $50,000 \u201cbecause it's a big round number.\u201d He's also looking at $51,000, which represents a late-December high.\n\nBitcoin remains about 30% below the record high of around $69,000 reached in November."

        "title": "Bitcoin Now The Best Performing Asset, Dogecoin Surges Amidst News of Twitter Integration While Big Eyes Coin ... - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "As per Bitcoin Analysis, Goldman Sachs, one of the most prominent firms in global investment banking and finance, highlights Bitcoin (BTC) as the best-performing asset in the first quarter of 2023, surpassing Nasdaq. 100, Gold, S & P 500 and other investment assets and sectors.\n\nAlong with BTC, Dogecoin (DOGE) also shows price surges after a bearish phase as news of Elon Musk integrating Twitter with DOGE came to the surface. The new meme coin in the crypto arena Big Eyes Coin (BIG), captivates the hearts of cryptocurrency enthusiasts with its new 250% bonus code.\n\nBitcoin To Reach $ 1 Million in 90 Days\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has gained 51% in YTD absolute returns, leaving behind IT (16%), Communication services (15%), Consumer Discretionary (11%), Russell 1000 Growth (10%), Gold (4%) and S & P 500 (4%). The coin\u2019s price rise is ascribed to the US Federal Reserve letting go of its intrusive monetary policy.\n\nIt has increased by 35% since March 10th, when Silicon Valley Bank shut down.\n\nIn contrast to 2022, the price of the primary digital asset has skyrocketed from $16500 on January 1st to $27901 at the time of writing.\n\nDigital Currency news says this might begin a new bull run for BTC. Ryan Selkis, CEO of Crypto Intelligence, Messari, forecasted its valuation to rise to $100,000 in the coming year. However, Balaji Srinivasan, Coinbase\u2019s former CTO, wagered $2 million against Twitter user James Medlock that BTC would be worth $1 million in 3 months.\n\nDogecoin: Acceptable Form OF Payment On Twitter\n\nElon Musk has filed for Twitter to be a money service business, meaning it could send cryptocurrencies and other fiat payments back and forth. Musk has always been a DOGE supporter and has been the raison d\u2019etre for Dogecoin\u2019s popularity. With the news of the altcoin\u2019s integration with Twitter surfacing, the price of DOGE surged by more than 50%.\n\nIn his usual style, Elon tweeted a picture of the Shiba Inu dog wearing a T-shirt with the Twitter logo and a wink emoji. Dogecoin is already an acceptable form of payment at other companies he runs- SpaceX and Tesla. Last year he also revealed that Dogecoin is one of the three cryptos he has ever invested in, along with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). DOGE remains the only crypto meme coin that his companies accept.\n\nBig Eyes Coin Offers 250% Bonus\n\nThe new meme coin Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is now on the final countdown to its launch. At stage 12 of a super successful presale, the cute coin has already raised $32.4 million.\n\nA coin centred around its community, and Big Eyes had always brought a spark to its presale right from stage 1 when the BIG token was worth $0.0001 to $0.00049 at present.\n\nThis means investors who purchased BIG during stage 1 earned 390% ROI. With rewards, bonuses and promo codes, BIG ensures every investor gets equal financial growth opportunities.\n\nWith its Loot Boxes that give 1000% ROI to the latest BULLRUN250 promo code, Big Eyes Coin is high on giving crypto enthusiasts a chance to make big money. This limited-time promo code offers a 250% bonus upon purchase of BIG tokens or the look boxes. The Loot Boxes can be bought for as low as $10 but can make you a millionaire overnight.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin seller loses lawsuit over deal involving $320k in cash - The Straits Times",
        "content": "SINGAPORE - A face-to-face transaction to sell $320,000 worth of Bitcoin went awry when a quarrel broke out over who was entitled to the cash after the buyer denied having received the cryptocurrency, despite the Bitcoin network confirming the transfer.\n\nMr Christofle Rio, who had transferred 12.14 bitcoins to a digital wallet, eventually left the Tanjong Pagar apartment without the cash and bereft of the cryptocurrency.\n\nHe then sued Mr Malcolm Tan Chun Chuen, the man who transacted with him, for breach of contract for failing to pay the agreed price.\n\nBut Mr Tan argued that his company, Qrypt Technologies, was merely a middleman that facilitated the sale of Bitcoin from Mr Rio\u2019s company, GCXpress Commerce (GCX), to the actual buyers.\n\nHe contended that he cannot be liable, nor does Mr Rio have the legal standing to sue, simply because the agreement was not between them as individuals, but between their respective companies.\n\nMr Rio\u2019s lawsuit was dismissed last Wednesday, after the High Court found that both men were not the proper parties to the contract as they were acting on behalf of their respective companies, and not in their personal capacities.\n\nMr Rio set up GCX in 2019 as a cryptocurrencies trading business, while Mr Tan, a disbarred lawyer, was the managing director of Qrypt, a digital assets and blockchain company.\n\nAccording to Mr Tan, he was contacted on Dec 1, 2020 via messaging app Telegram by someone identified as \u201cKenneth\u201d, who asked to buy more than $300,000 worth of Bitcoin.\n\nMr Tan then contacted Mr Rio, who said he had $320,000 worth of Bitcoin to sell. They arranged to conduct the transaction at Mr Tan\u2019s office at 18 Spottiswoode Park Road that afternoon.\n\nMr Tan then informed Kenneth about the meeting. Kenneth said he would be present at the office with his staff, and emphasised that all communication should be done via Telegram.\n\nAt 4.10pm, three men, who identified themselves as Kenneth, Eric Foo and Chua Hong You, arrived at Mr Tan\u2019s office. Mr Foo took cash out of a bag and placed it on a table in the room.\n\nMr Tan asked Kenneth for his identity card to allow Qrypt\u2019s compliance manager to complete the checks to comply with Monetary Authority of Singapore regulations.\n\nKenneth declined and asked Mr Chua to provide his identity card instead. Mr Chua was cleared to proceed with the transaction.\n\nSome confusion was caused when a second buyer showed up, also carrying $320,000 in cash. The buyers had apparently arranged for him to wait downstairs. He was told to leave the premises."

        "title": "ChatGPT joins crypto hype, sets Bitcoin price at $300,000 by 2030 - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "After venture capitalist and former CTO at cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase Balaji Srinivasan made a shocking claim that Bitcoin (BTC) could reach the price of $1 million in the following three months, many in the crypto community became intrigued, wondering if his prediction could truly materialize.\n\nAs the guesswork continued en masse, some analysts have turned to OpenAI\u2019s text-based artificial intelligence (AI) platform ChatGPT for suggestions, so the Finbold team decided to give it a shot as well, and the results were indeed bullish, although far from the $1 million touted by some individuals.\n\n$300,000 in cards?\n\nAs always, upon being asked to offer hypothetical average Bitcoin predictions for each year in the 2024-2030 period, ChatGPT warned it was only an AI language model and, as such, could not \u201cpredict future Bitcoin prices with certainty or accuracy,\u201d but it ultimately did manage to deliver some interesting rounded up numbers.\n\nAccording to the figures provided by the AI tool, Bitcoin is expected to reach the price of $150,000 in 2024, adding around $25,000 every following year until it (speculatively) hits a very enticing number of $300,000 in 2030, as per the query posted on March 29.\n\nBitcoin 2024-2030 average price predictions. Source: ChatGPT\n\nAlthough this prognosis is indeed very optimistic, others have gotten even more bullish responses from ChatGPT. Specifically, Twitter user Priced in Bitcoin had earlier shared an exceptionally optimistic prediction reportedly retrieved from the chatbot, which sees the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset changing hands at the price of $1 million by 2030.\n\nI asked #chatGPT to predict the price of #Bitcoin by 2030, the results are staggering \ud83d\udc47\n\n\n\n2024: $28,571\n\n2025: $90,909\n\n2026: $400,00\n\n2027: $111,111\n\n2028: $166,667\n\n2029: $500,000\n\n2030: $1,000,000\n\n\n\nMight want to buy some in case it catches on\u2026 pic.twitter.com/TpRokjqu2o \u2014 Priced in \u20bfitcoin \u221e/21M (@PricedinBTC) March 28, 2023\n\nAs a reminder, this is the same number envisioned by Balaji Srinivasan, albeit on a much longer time scale. Having said that, Finbold was unable to replicate this same response by ChatGPT despite using diverse and numerous prompts.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin is at press time trading at the price of $28,425, up 5.11% in the last 24 hours and 0.57% across the previous week, adding up to the gains of 20.75% on its monthly chart, as the maiden cryptocurrency is nearing the $30,000 level and recording a \u2018strong buy\u2019 sentiment.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nIt should also be noted that Bitcoin has added nearly $30 billion to its market capitalization in a single day, although the Chief Market Strategist at InTheMoneyStocks.com, Gareth Soloway, believes that it could drop below $13,000, possibly even as low as $9,000 in 2023 before another rally begins.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has shown resilience in the face of heightened regulatory scrutiny, driven mostly by its flagship asset \u2013 Bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 which has added nearly $30 billion to its market capitalization over the course of a single day, indicating a positive momentum that could push its price toward $30,000.\n\nAs it happens, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap has gone from $519.76 billion to $548.60 billion in the last 24 hours, which means that it has grown by $28.84 billion or 5.6%, according to the latest data retrieved by Finbold from the cryptocurrency monitoring platform CoinMarketCap on March 29.\n\nBitcoin 24-hour market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nDuring this time, the price of the maiden decentralized finance (DeFi) asset has gained 5.28%, at press time changing hands at $28,364. Its current price also represents an increase of 0.35% over the last week, adding up to the monthly boost of 20.49% and over 70% since the year\u2019s turn, as charts indicate.\n\nBitcoin 24-hour price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin is demonstrating a \u2018strong buy\u2019 sentiment at 16 at its one-day technical gauges over at the crypto and finance tracking platform TradingView. This sentiment is summarized by the oscillators standing in the \u2018buy\u2019 zone at 2 and moving averages (MA) pointing at a \u2018strong buy\u2019 at 14.\n\nBitcoin 1-day sentiment gauges. Source: TradingView\n\nIt should be mentioned that Bitcoin\u2019s odds of a bullish rally are also increased by its break out of the relative strength index (RSI) downtrend, as the asset holds the $27,200 level despite the chart pattern behavior that could be described as choppy.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s break out of RSI downtrend. Source: Matthew Hyland\n\nMoreover, venture capitalist and ex-CTO at crypto trading platform Coinbase, Balaji Srinivasan, has projected that Bitcoin would reach $1 million within the next 90 days as the U.S. economy enters hyperinflation. Although his prediction has been rebuked by Matthew Kratter, founder of the Trader University YouTube channel, he does agree it is \u201cdirectionally correct.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Finbold has reported on Bitcoin\u2019s market cap surpassing that of traditional finance behemoths such as payment platform Visa (NYSE: V) and banking giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), as well as outperforming the year-to-date (YTD) returns of 97% of all S&P 500 companies in 2023.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
