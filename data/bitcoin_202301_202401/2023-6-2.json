        "title": "3 Cryptos That Are Better Buys Than Bitcoin or Ethereum - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Many crypto investors will likely assert that no cryptos are better buys than Bitcoin (BTC-USD) or Ethereum (ETH-USD). To some extent, when measuring for risk-adjusted returns over the long-term, that argument holds water, as there are several high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin worth considering.\n\nHowever, not all investors are looking at crypto with the same investing time horizon or frame of reference. Over the near-term, a number of other top tokens have performed very well, and may outperform these top two cryptos over time.\n\nAmidst the backdrop of a domestic banking crisis and looming concerns over a U.S. debt default, investors are increasingly considering cryptocurrencies as potential safe haven assets to navigate the economic challenges ahead. This shift in thinking marks a significant departure from just six months ago when the prevailing belief was that the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d would persist well into 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut, the question arises: Are there any genuinely secure cryptocurrencies to invest in at present? If so, which ones should investors consider adding to their portfolios this month? Here are three cryptos on the top of my list of projects that could potentially outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum over the next 2-3 years.\n\nSymbol Cryptocurrency Price XMR-USD Monero $145.68 AVAX-USD Avalanche $14.44 SOL-USD Solana $20.50\n\nMonero (XMR-USD)\n\nA concept coin for Monero (XMR) has a sparkly gold background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIntroduced in 2014, Monero (XMR-USD) is a decentralized cryptocurrency and blockchain network that prioritizes privacy. With its advanced features like stealth addresses and ring signatures, Monero ensures user anonymity. Nonetheless, this commitment to privacy has also attracted heightened regulatory attention globally. This makes it one of those high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin.\n\nMonero is a leading privacy coin, offering complete anonymity and untraceability for its blockchain transactions. By employing advanced technology, Monero conceals the sender, recipient, and transaction amount, providing a high level of privacy. Encapsulating its ethos, with its motto \u201csecure, private, untraceable,\u201d Monero has garnered global user appeal. The rising demand for privacy coins has propelled XMR\u2019s price up by 16% over the past six months.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother key point is that despite regulatory and legislative scrutiny due to its potential involvement in illicit activities like international money laundering, Monero remains popular among users who are undeterred by such criticisms. The usage and value of XMR have consistently increased, with a remarkable 76% rise since 2017. Crypto enthusiasts believe that the ongoing regulation of cryptocurrencies will further drive users toward the privacy provided by Monero, indicating promising prospects for continued growth.\n\nMonero relies on Proof-of-Work for decentralized consensus and offers private, secure, and untraceable transactions through an opaque blockchain. With a default privacy setting, Monero utilizes ring confidential transactions, ring signatures, and stealth addresses. As a fungible and secure digital currency, Monero prioritizes user privacy, leading to a promising future ahead.\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD)\n\nGraphic of various cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum resting on a United Kingdom Union Jack flag\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rawf8\n\nAvalanche (AVAX-USD) started May 2023 on a bullish note, trading at $16.66. Despite the bears maintaining a price of $14 since May 18, Avalanche is now edging toward the $15 mark, aiming to regain its positive price trend. The surge in trading volume indicates increased activity on the network.\n\nRecently, Avalanche has established significant support at the $14.29 price level, acting as a pivotal point for the asset. Currently, it is trading above this immediate resistance level. However, the presence of bearish market forces persists, aiming to prevent AVAX from surpassing the next resistance level at $15.21. Despite its bearish nature in the short-term, it\u2019s still one of those high potential cryptos better than Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the integration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine sets Avalanche apart as a favored platform. Developers can now create decentralized applications on a broader scale while leveraging the advantages of a faster and more economical blockchain. The Avalanche Bridge further enhances convenience and accessibility by facilitating seamless asset transfers across multiple blockchains.\n\nThe bottom line is that Avalanche stands out as a superior choice in terms of security compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Its unique feature of subnets allows the creation of both private and public blockchains, adding versatility to its network. With practical applications in the real world, Avalanche exhibits immense potential for value and growth. Despite facing a significant downturn in the 2022 bear market, Avalanche has made a remarkable recovery in 2023, positioning itself as a compelling contender in the realm of decentralized finance.\n\nSolana (SOL-USD)\n\nSolana logo on phone screen stock image. Solana price predictions.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) empowers the development of decentralized applications (DApps) through its distinctive hybrid consensus model. By merging proof-of-history (PoH) with underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, Solana achieves exceptionally fast transaction processing. Furthermore, this speed makes it appealing to individual traders as well as institutional investors seeking efficient blockchain solutions.\n\nSolana, launched by the Solana Foundation in March 2020, stands out as an unconventional cryptocurrency project. It prioritizes functionality and operates on an open-source framework, utilizing blockchain technology to drive decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Notably, Solana excels in both transaction speed and cost-efficiency, ensuring scalability and rapid processing. However, the network has faced intermittent outages, impacting its value and ambitions. Some critics also raise concerns about its tokenomics favoring venture capital investors. Nonetheless, Solana remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency realm.\n\nIn summary, Solana has seen a remarkable 100% surge this year, solidifying its position as an innovation powerhouse. In addition to this, their latest breakthrough, the Saga crypto phone, has the potential to revolutionize the crypto landscape. The Saga is an Android-powered mobile device designed to simplify and enhance crypto activities. With its pioneering Seed Vault technology, it streamlines the process of using your phone as a crypto wallet, eliminating common challenges faced by conventional phones. Experience a new level of convenience and efficiency in managing your crypto assets with the Saga crypto phone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in ETH, SOL.

        "content": "Bitcoin price predictions are always absolutely everywhere. Everyone who pays attention to crypto, whether for investing, building or entertainment, cannot avoid reading daily wild headlines about where the price of BTC is heading.\n\n\u201cThe Fed May Have Just Triggered a $100 Billion Bitcoin Price Boom as Ethereum Surges Back,\u201d \u201cBitcoin Price Drops Below $28,000 Post Labor Day \u2013 Rough Road Ahead,\u201d and \u201cBitcoin at $100,000? Insiders Say the Cryptocurrency Could Test New Highs This Year,\u201d are some of my recent favorites.\n\nFrom $1,000,000 price bets to the proverbial \u201cimminent crash,\u201d those who have been around long enough in this space have either learned to tune predictions out or play into their hyped narrative themselves.\n\nWith the next bitcoin halving event less than a year away, it\u2019s a given that prices will move, maybe even wildly. So it\u2019s time we stop predicting the price of bitcoin like it\u2019s something interesting, useful, or even, frankly, predictable at all.\n\nInstead, there\u2019s an argument to be made that a new challenger to the bitcoin price prediction has entered the room \u2014 a contender for new predictions that could actually bring some useful insight to the community.\n\nThe challenger? Bitcoin transaction fees.\n\nIf we were able to provide more insight about bitcoin transaction fees, our predictions could actually be useful instead of hollow headline grabbers \u2014 we could help users find the lowest fee moments to dive into new use cases on Bitcoin, or help builders develop and scale Bitcoin layers more efficiently.\n\nBitcoin was meant to scale\n\nInterest surrounding all aspects of the Bitcoin blockchain has hit record levels, as Ordinals, Stamps, BRC-20 tokens and other new protocols have sprouted up this year. Bitcoin\u2019s average daily transactions over seven days reached record highs, the first time it\u2019s done so since December 2017. We\u2019re entering this era where people actually want to do something more with Bitcoin than just point out its price.\n\nGlassnode reported that the average transactions reached 586,704.42 throughout May. The average transaction fee reached as high as seven dollars, as Ordinal inscriptions surpassed three million in May 2023.\n\nThe thing we have forgotten is Bitcoin was always meant to scale. Low fees were always going to be temporary. That\u2019s why Bitcoin layer-2 solutions exist. As is the case with every other major layer-1 blockchain, when the base layer began to bloat, layer-2s were designed to efficiently scale usage and reprioritize where demand went toward the base layer.\n\nRead More: Ron DeSantis Posturing On Bitcoin Is Just Performative Politics\n\nThe Bitcoin builders community has talked about the idea of DeFi and other use cases coming back to Bitcoin from other layer-1s for years, and now we are seeing that prediction become a reality. This revival of activity for Bitcoin means that the day-to-day price of transaction fees is going to matter more for many users than the daily moving average cost of one BTC.\n\nI\u2019ll go first with this new prediction model.\n\nI predict that we will see another 10x from here in transaction fees.\n\nAs the Bitcoin thesis continues playing out, and as layer-1 apps grow and scale into layer-2s, we will see multiple spikes in the daily transaction price that will worry some and excite others. Ultimately, the higher fees will benefit the entire Bitcoin community.\n\nNow, it\u2019s your turn.\n\nRena Shah is the Head of Operations and Strategy at Trust Machines, a company building the largest ecosystem of applications on Bitcoin.

        "content": "The Company\u2019s bitcoin holdings grew 44%; Bitcoin mined increased 16% in May, to 609 BTC\n\nLAS VEGAS, June 02, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CleanSpark Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSK), America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122, today released its unaudited bitcoin mining and operations update for the month ending May 31, 2023.\n\n\u201cWe achieved a significant milestone during the month of May,\u201d said Zach Bradford, CEO. \u201cNot only do we continue to increase the amount of bitcoin in our treasury, but we also surpassed $100 million in revenue for our fiscal year to date. Importantly, we achieved this milestone with the bulk of our expansion expected to come later this year.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the amount of bitcoin we mined this month exceeded expectations, largely due to increases in operational efficiency and a brief, albeit significant, increase in transaction fees. For about five days in May, fees were elevated because of increased interest in ordinals on the blockchain. At its peak, our bitcoin production jumped to nearly 30 bitcoins in a single day, almost double our normal daily production of about 18 bitcoins. Since then, transaction fees have normalized.\u201d\n\nMay Bitcoin Mining Update (unaudited)\n\nBitcoin mined in May: 609\n\nCY2023 bitcoin mined: 3,004\n\nTotal BTC holdings as of May 31: 451\n\nTotal BTC converted for operations and growth in May: 471\n\nCurrently deployed fleet of about 67,196 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a hashrate of 6.7 EH/s\n\nThe Company funded growth and operations through the sale of 471 bitcoins in May 2023 at an average of approximately $27,400 per BTC. Sales of BTC equated to proceeds of approximately $12.9 million. May daily BTC mined averaged 19.6 and reached a high of 29.6, due to a brief period of unusually high transaction fees.\n\nOperational Updates\n\nWashington. The 50MW expansion continues to track according to projected timelines, despite a series of rain delays that temporarily slowed down progress. Miners are arriving daily with all units expected to be at the facility by the end of the month. Racking has begun and energization is expected to begin in the second half of June.\n\nStory continues\n\nSandersville. Crews are making headway in prepping the land for the Company\u2019s expansion at its Sandersville site. The planned expansion will add over 6 EH/s to CleanSpark\u2019s mining operations. Additional updates about the expansion are posted from time-to-time on the Company\u2019s Twitter feed, @CleanSpark_Inc.\n\nAbout CleanSpark\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK) is America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122.

        "content": "Bitcoin \u201cconsolidation\u201d could end by July, new research predicts as optimism over a BTC price breakout returns.\n\nIn its latest market update on June 2, trading firm QCP Capital revealed a bullish bias on both Bitcoin (BTC) and the largest altcoin, Ether (ETH).\n\nQCP Capital: Bitcoin consolidation \u201cplayed out perfectly\u201d\n\nBitcoin price has been ranging between $26,000 and $31,000 since mid-March, but analysts are increasingly calling time on the sideways action.\n\nQCP Capital is among them, predicting a change of course as soon as the end of the month.\n\nThis, it argues, is thanks to the United States debt ceiling \u201csideshow\u201d vanishing, leaving Bitcoin closely mimicking its consolidation and breakout phase from 2020.\n\n\u201cWith the passage of the Debt ceiling bill through the House and Senate that extends the ceiling until Jan 2025, we can now all move on and not have to worry about any political sideshow again until next year\u2019s US Presidential elections,\u201d it wrote.\n\n\u201cThis means we now return to our regular programming of proper macro and crypto narratives.\u201d\n\nFor QCP, the price levels may be different, but the underlying behavior is the same in 2023 as at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBack then, the Federal Reserve unleashed a giant $4 trillion worth of liquidity, buoying risk assets and ultimately sending Bitcoin to new all-time highs.\n\n\u201cIn March 2020 we were on the verge of a massive price breakdown below 5k when the Fed unleashed the liquidity tap, resulting in an exponential price increase as we approached the halving cycle the following year,\u201d it wrote, quoting a previous edition of its \u201cJust Crypto\u201d newsletter series.\n\n\u201cSimilarly in March 2023, we were about to break below 20k on BTC as a result of the banking crisis risk-off, when the Fed again unleashed the liquidity tap to drive us back above 30k, as we head into the next halving cycle next year.\u201d\n\nShould the relationship continue to play out, the next phase is obvious: a dramatic exit of the trading range, with QCP positioning long options plays.\n\n\u201cThis consolidation has played out perfectly so far, but we expect that we are soon coming close to the end sometime this month. As a result, we recommend positioning for an upcoming big move through long 3m and 6m strangles here, with a bias to the long call side,\u201d it added.\n\nAn accompanying chart showed the month of June as a hotspot for both BTC and ETH volatility from 2019 onward.\n\n3-month \u201cat-the-money\u201d volatility chart for BTC, ETH (screenshot).

During the timeframe, major economies like the United States contributed to the dwindling numbers, but Australia, Poland and Spain increased crypto ATM installations.\n\nA histogram chart shows the net change of cryptocurrency machine numbers installed and removed monthly. Source: Coin ATM Radar\n\nThe chart above shows that, in the first four months of 2023, the net crypto ATMs worldwide declined by 5,850. In May, however, 1,397 machines were added back to the global crypto ATM network, confirming data from Coin ATM Radar.\n\nWhile Bitcoin ATMs do not contribute to the growth of the Bitcoin network, it serves as a physical gateway for people to exchange their fiat currencies for crypto. In 2023 alone, Australia installed a total of 233 ATMs, climbing up the ranks to become the third-largest crypto ATM hub in the world.\n\nDespite a poor year-long reduction, the United States maintains a leading position \u2014 representing 84.7% of crypto ATMs worldwide, followed by Canada at 7.6%.\n\nRelated: Australia ranks 3rd in crypto ATM installations after US and Canada\n\nAt the time of writing, 35,069 ATMs remain operational worldwide.

        "title": "Europe\u2019s right-wing political groups find cause in crypto - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The European crypto scene has gained significant traction over the past few years, with a surge in the interest in and adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. While the crypto industry is often associated with decentralization, innovation and financial freedom, it is not immune to various political ideologies and influences, and right-wing movements are no exception.\n\nThe attraction of cryptocurrencies for right-wing politicians in Europe can stem from several factors. Right-wing ideologies often prioritize individual freedoms and limited government intervention. Cryptocurrencies, with their decentralized nature, offer the potential for financial sovereignty by allowing individuals to have control over their money without relying on traditional financial systems or government regulations.\n\nRight-wing politicians also may perceive cryptocurrencies as a way to challenge the existing financial establishment and its perceived biases or control. Bitcoin (BTC), in particular, emerged after the 2008 financial crisis, a crisis that led many to lose trust in traditional financial institutions and governmental monetary policies.\n\nIn addition, many became concerned about central banks and their influence on monetary policy, and Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature appealed to those who advocate alternative monetary systems outside of central bank control.\n\nBitcoin as an \u201calternative for Germany\u201d\n\nFor example, a German exit from the euro and a return to the Deutschmark (the country\u2019s former currency) is a well-known demand of the right-wing populist political party Alternative for Germany (AfD). Although there is no official or clear strategy within the anti-euro party regarding cryptocurrencies, some members have clearly expressed their positive attitude toward Bitcoin.\n\nFor instance, AfD leader Alice Weidel has attended several Bitcoin conferences, called herself a \u201cBitcoin entrepreneur\u201d and wanted to launch a Bitcoin startup. Even Aaron Koenig, a German entrepreneur and the founder of the brick-and-mortar crypto exchange Bitcoin Exchange Berlin, was on the stage with Weidel, and both presented their view of \u201cmoney without a state.\u201d\n\nThe AfD\u2019s prioritization of crypto is also evident in its behavior in the Bundestag, Germany\u2019s parliament. On several occasions, the AfD has submitted \u201cKleine Anfragen\u201d (literally, \u201csmall requests\u201d) to the government. This instrument of parliamentary procedure requires an official response from the Bundestag and is often a way for opposition parties to demand accountability for specific actions or inquire as to why other measures were not taken.\n\nFor instance, the party asked a \u201csmall question\u201d about crypto donations for Ukraine, how a cryptocurrency could replace the previous currency, what effects this would have on the banking system, and how much Bitcoin German federal authorities own. AfD also opposed a proposed Bitcoin ban during discussions among European lawmakers last year.\n\nThe concept of cryptocurrency is, in some places, being linked to the right-wing \u2014 and, in part, radical \u2014 positions of the AfD.\n\nFor years, some experts, such as David Golumbia \u2014 a digital studies professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who researches the politics of cryptocurrency \u2014 have warned that blockchain could be hijacked by right-wing and libertarian groups.\n\nRecent: Does the US have a crypto \u2018tax loophole\u2019 problem?\n\nIn Golumbia\u2019s view, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies could be the realization of their vision of a world without government control. As a former member of the Hayek Society, Weidel belongs to the radical economic liberal wing of her party. The Hayek Society is named after Austrian economist Friedrich August von Hayek, who was an advocate of an unfettered market with as little government intervention as possible.\n\nSupport for crypto among Europe\u2019s right-wing parties\n\nIt\u2019s not only German right-wing politicians who have voiced interest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology as potential disruptors of traditional financial systems, with the leaders of the Dutch right-wing parties Party for Freedom (PVV) and Forum for Democracy (FvD) \u2014 Geert Wilders and Thierry Baudet, respectively \u2014 also speaking positively on the subject.\n\nBaudet even wants to make the Netherlands a Bitcoin hub and released two NFT series on the theme of his fight against World Economic Forum founder and CEO Klaus Schwab. Baudet is a fierce critic of the WEF, which he believes is leading the world in the wrong direction and causing serious threats to individual freedom.\n\nPolish politician Jaroslaw Gowin and his center-right party, Agreement \u2014 formerly known as Poland Together \u2014 were part of the ruling United Right coalition from 2015 to 2021. For most of that period, Gowin served as deputy prime minister, as well as being a member of parliament.\n\nWhen Gowin was the leader of the Agreement party, he expressed a positive attitude toward cryptocurrencies, acknowledging their potential to promote financial innovation. The politician also consulted with many people from the industry about cryptocurrencies and blockchain. For example, the party held a meeting where Prime Minister Gowin listened to the recommendations of industry experts, including economist Krzysztof Piech and Filip Pawczynski, president of the Polish Bitcoin Association.\n\nNigel Farage, a prominent figure in British politics and former leader of the right-wing pro-Brexit UK Independence Party, has also shown interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn a 2022 interview with Cointelegraph, Farage \u2014 also a former member of the European Parliament \u2014 said he first became aware of Bitcoin 10 years ago and shared his perspective on the potential future of Bitcoin adoption in Europe: \u201cWhat happens in America first happens here [in Europe], too. There\u2019s going to be a very, very big change here over the next two or three years, and it [Bitcoin] will become a trusted means of exchange.\u201d\n\nFarage also believes that Bitcoin has gained appeal as an alternative to the existing financial infrastructure, noting the latter\u2019s inefficiency, high costs and slow speeds.\n\nOther right-wing politicians haven\u2019t made specific statements about cryptocurrencies but are still taking steps to embrace digital currencies. Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the prime minister of Hungary and leader of the right-wing Fidesz party, and his government are currently considering the potential benefits of launching a central bank digital currency. Hungary also appears to be warming up to crypto across the board, with the government revealing plans in 2021 to cut taxes on crypto trading from 30.5% to 15% as part of an economic recovery program.\n\nRight-wing extremists rely on crypto payments\n\nNot only have right-wing politicians discovered cryptocurrencies, but right-wing extremist movements have also been utilizing crypto. In 2022, the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) published a report on the massive increase in the use of crypto payments by right-wing extremist groups in recent years.\n\nCrypto payments are not a new tool for ultranationalists and European extremist groups proclaiming the superiority of the \u201cwhite race\u201d and advocating for a \u201cwhite\u201d Europe and North America. In fact, they are among the early adopters of the technology, accepting BTC donations as early as 2012, according to the MEMRI.\n\nThe United States-based Southern Poverty Law Center has further compiled a list of extremist groups accepting crypto donations.\n\nUltranationalist and extremist groups are actively using cryptocurrencies not only for reasons of convenience and ideology \u2014 and because they are being shut out of traditional and mainstream online banking systems \u2014 but also because funds held in crypto cannot be accessed or seized by anyone.\n\nSo, is crypto a right-wing movement, then?\n\nDoes this all mean that crypto in Europe is a right-wing thing? Not really.\n\nWhile crypto itself is not inherently Right or Left, it is not without ideology, nor is it completely free of political positions \u2014 even if its political relations are indirect. Politicians can like it or hate it, regardless of their political persuasion, and support for cryptocurrencies among politicians is not limited to those leaning toward the Right. For example, the German liberal, pro-free market Free Democratic Party also advocates for a friendly policy toward cryptocurrencies.\n\nRecent: Increasing number of divorce proceedings involve crypto\n\nWhile the European crypto scene is not inherently right-wing, there are notable instances of right-wing influence within the community, according to the MEMRI report, which also states that it is crucial to address these concerns by fostering education, implementing regulations and ensuring that the crypto space remains inclusive, transparent and aligned with democratic principles.\n\nMEMRI further stated that social media platforms and online communities need to take proactive steps to curb hate speech, misinformation and extremist content, while also promoting healthy, constructive dialogue."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nWhile El Salvador attracts more tourists, American lawmakers are still pushing for a risk report on whether the Bitcoin-friendly nation is a potential threat to the US.\n\nLast month, senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), ranking member and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, reintroduced a bipartisan bill asking for a State Department report on El Salvador\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin and potential impacts on bilateral economic relations and law enforcement cooperation.\n\nThe bill, the Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador (ACES) Act, was first introduced back in February last year by Risch, Menedez and Bill Cassidy (R-La.).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGiven U.S. interest on prosperity and transparency in Central America, we must seek greater clarity on how the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender may impact El Salvador\u2019s financial and economic stability, as well as El Salvador\u2019s capacity to effectively combat money laundering and illicit finances,\u201d a Foreign Relations Committee blog post says.\n\nThe lawmakers want an analysis of El Salvador\u2019s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender and \u201cthe risks for cybersecurity, economic stability, and democratic governance in El Salvador.\u201d\n\nEl Salvador made headlines in 2021 when it became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender.\n\nPresident Nayib Bukele has bought large amounts of the cryptocurrency and businesses in El Salvador now have to accept Bitcoin by law if they have the technological means to do so.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPresident Bukele\u2019s Bitcoin experiment has been praised by those in the cryptocurrency world, but criticized by institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World bank.\n\nSaifedean Ammous, author of \u201cThe Bitcoin Standard,\u201d this week became the newest economic advisor to El Salvador\u2019s National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC)\u2014an entity managing \u201call matters relating to cryptocurrency\u201d in the country.\n\nEl Salvador, once one of the most murderous countries on the planet, now has a low homicide rate following the Bukele government\u2019s crackdown on street gangs.\n\nThe dramatic drop in crime is helping draw tech bros and surfers to the Central American nation but human rights groups have criticized the regime\u2014alleging its mass incarceration of criminals is authoritarian.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. seems to be cracking down on Bitcoin: since the collapse of mega digital asset exchange FTX in November, American regulators have made it harder to do business for crypto companies in the world\u2019s biggest economy. (The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has said Bitcoin is a commodity.)\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2014and the cryptocurrency industry\u2014is a hot topic for next year\u2019s presidential election. Florida governor and hopeful Ron DeSantis has voiced his love for Bitcoin."

        "content": "Solana\u2019s secondary non-fungible token (NFT) sales dropped nearly 50% in May, to US$44.9 million from US$85.7 million in April. The Forkast SOL NFT Composite, a measure of NFT activities in the Solana blockchain, also decreased by 12.13% throughout May.\n\nThe dip in Solana\u2019s NFT market coincides with a surge in Ordinals, a type of NFTs on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin\u2019s monthly NFT sales volume skyrocketed by 474% in May, reaching over US$189 million, according to CryptoSlam data. This boost positioned Bitcoin as the second most popular NFT chain, a title often held by Solana.\n\n\u201cThe single reason for the major change in the Solana ecosystem is simply the impact of Bitcoin NFTs,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs. \u201cSince Bitcoin NFTs launched at the end of January you can see Solana\u2019s numbers steadily decreasing. Sellers, buyers, total transactions, are all 50% or less than they were prior to Bitcoin NFTs.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s monthly NFT sales multiplied by more than six-fold, growing from US$32 million in April to US$195.7 million in May. The Bitcoin blockchain recorded its 10 millionth Ordinals inscription on Monday, Dune Analytics data showed.\n\n\u201cPeople who use Solana are likely already Bitcoin users, but it doesn\u2019t work the other way around. I would assume that many who use Bitcoin don\u2019t touch other chains other than Ethereum. The point here is that the Bitcoin blockchain appeals to every single crypto and NFT trader, and the same can\u2019t be said for Solana,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nThe recent surge in memecoins has also factored into Solana\u2019s falling NFT sales, according to Brian Boisjoli, product manager at Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cThe majority of people were trading memecoins instead of NFTs,\u201d said Boisjoli, who has also traded memecoins over NFTs in the recent fad. \u201cIt suggests people are going to chase the hot item and leave the last shiny [NFT] in the dust.\n\nInterest in memecoins surged in April, led by tokens like Pepe and Floki that were listed on major crypto exchanges like Binance. Pepe rose nearly 7,000% in two weeks after it launched on April 17 and is up over 2,100% since its launch, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe number of unique NFT buyers on Solana dropped to 56,729 in May from 83,241 in April, according to CryptoSlam.\n\n\u201cWhen memecoin season settles, I\u2019m sure the capital will come back to NFTs,\u201d Boisjoli added.\n\nWill Bitcoin reach Ethereum\u2019s NFT sales volume?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s May NFT sales of US$195.7 stood at nearly half of Ethereum\u2019s monthly total of US$356 million, which is the largest blockchain by NFT sales volume. Monthly NFT sales volume decreased by 21.98% on Ethereum, and the Forkast ETH NFT Composite fell 4.35%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s monthly sales volume increased by 377.25% in the same period, according to CryptoSlam.\n\n\u201cPeople should really pay attention to how significant, and how disruptive Bitcoin NFTs are. Especially if you are of the mind that Bitcoin NFTs volume could eclipse Ethereum\u2019s in the future. At that point, will there be any demand for blockchains other than Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ethereum\u2019s layer 2s,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nHe added that Bitcoin will continue to capture market share from alternative chains to reshape the NFT landscape.\n\nThe new BRC-721E token standard launched on Monday enables Ethereum-native NFTs to be transferred to Bitcoin. The new standard permanently burns the ERC-721 NFT on Ethereum, allowing users to claim the recreated version of the NFT on Bitcoin as a BRC-721E inscription.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin and Ethereum: Two titans battle for NFT supremacy"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) miners in the United States can breathe a sigh of relief after a proposed tax on crypto mining did not make it into a bill to raise the U.S. debt ceiling that appears set to pass.\n\nThe Digital Assets Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax proposal sought to charge crypto miners a tax equal to 10% of the cost of the electricity they used for mining in 2024, before scaling up to 30% in 2026.\n\nThe tax was highly controversial, with critics arguing that it had the potential to increase global emissions as a result of miners being forced to go overseas where countries may produce more emissions during energy production.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin miners seek out cheap energy, and as one of the cheapest sources of energy is excess renewable energy, Bitcoin miners can actually incentivize its production by providing utilities with a buyer for energy that would otherwise be wasted.\n\nThe news broke after Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms vice president of research Pierre Rochard noted on May 28 that the proposed bill did not include any mention of the DAME tax, which Representative Warren Davidson replied was \u201cone of the victories\u201d of the bill.\n\nYes, one of the victories is blocking proposed taxes. \u2014 Warren Davidson (@WarrenDavidson) May 29, 2023\n\nDead and buried or set to return?\n\nWhile much of the online discussion around the news suggested the proposal was \u201cdead,\u201d others, such as Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter, highlighted that it was only temporarily defeated, alluding to the possibility of it being included in future bills.\n\nBitcoin mining \"DAME\" tax defeated (for now)\n\n\n\nBiden CEA, specifically Heather Boushey, hold this L https://t.co/hJgZ7oUGub \u2014 nic carter (@nic__carter) May 29, 2023\n\nCarter suggested later in a May 29 Twitter thread that the administration would likely attempt to sneak it into some omnibus bill and would already have done so if it had the political currency to do so.\n\nBut bills are required to pass both through Congress and the House, and considering the Republican party is generally opposed to increases in taxes and currently controls the House, it seems unlikely such an omnibus bill would be able to make it to the president\u2019s desk.\n\nWhile speaking to Chamber of Digital Commerce founder and CEO Perianne Boring during a May 20 fireside chat at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, Senator Cynthia Lummis assured viewers that the DAME tax \u201cisn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d\n\nLummis added that ensuring Bitcoin mining firms remain in the U.S. was important for both national security and energy security, highlighting how Bitcoin mining can both reduce gas flaring emissions and help stabilize the energy grid.\n\nCointelegraph contacted the White House asking whether it planned to continue pursuing the DAME tax but did not receive a response.\n\nIs the damage already done?\n\nIn response to questions from Cointelegraph, Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings CEO Fred Thiel suggested that, regardless of whether President Joe Biden\u2019s administration decides to keep pursuing the DAME tax, it will continue its anti-crypto agenda, saying:\n\n\u201cI think it is clear that this administration will continue to broadly oppose the crypto sector, and even if this specific tax is no longer on the table, it is likely not the last of misguided, targeted efforts to bring this industry down.\u201d\n\nMany from within the crypto industry and even some U.S. lawmakers agree with this take, arguing that, among other measures, the U.S. government is making a coordinated effort to discourage banks from working with crypto firms \u2014 aka Choke Point 2.0 \u2014 under the guise of ensuring the financial system remains stable and safe.\n\nWhen businesses make long-term decisions, they generally seek to reduce risk. So, given the choice of operating in a region with clear, crypto-friendly policies compared to one where regulations are unclear, and there is a greater potential for policies that hurt the competitiveness of U.S.-based activity, firms will generally choose the former.\n\nThiel highlighted how the actions of the U.S. government and regulators weigh in on business decisions while speaking to Cointelegraph, saying, \u201cRegardless of the DAME tax\u2019s likelihood of passing, Marathon has already begun diversifying the locations of our operations.\u201d\n\nAsia Express: Yuan stablecoin team arrested, WeChat\u2019s new Bitcoin prices, HK crypto rules\n\nThiel added that \u201cwith regulation around mining being so nebulous,\u201d his firm has made the strategic decision not to concentrate its footprint in the U.S. but rather diversify its operations.\n\nHe pointed to a May 9 announcement from his firm, which said it would be building two new mining facilities in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAbu Dhabi is a region that has made a concerted effort to attract crypto-related investment via its clear regulatory regime, which has been hailed as pro-market."

Gox.\n\nIn December 2017, when Bitcoin hit highs of nearly $20,000, Bitcoin once again took the lead in search interest.\n\nThe third and most recent occurrence took place in February 2021, as Bitcoin soared above $43,000 following the news that Tesla had bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, and its decision to start accepting Bitcoin payments.\n\nThe country banned cryptocurrencies in 2021, and shortly after, it was reported by Cointelegraph\u2019s staff in China that online searches for several major cryptocurrency exchanges were returning zero results.\n\nRelated: Australia asks if \u2018high-risk\u2019 AI should be banned in surprise consultation\n\nMeanwhile, China has seen searches for \u201cAI\u201d hit their all-time high of 100 in April 2023.

        "title": "Blockchain: the balancing act between efficiency and security - Santander",
        "content": "There are currently all types of combinations, depending on block size and the rate at which new blocks are added. In Bitcoin's blockchain, for example, the block is usually two megabytes (2 MB) in size, but can very between 1 MB and 4 MB, and the blockchain is designed to take 10 minutes to add a block to the chain. As a result of these restrictions, the Bitcoin network has been criticised for having low scalability), but the speed of payments under this system is beginning to be addressed through Lightning Networks. Other blockchain networks that emerged after Bitcoin have a larger block size (Bitcoin Cash, BCH; has blocks 8 MB) or can add a new block to the network in less time (this is the case of Litecoin (LTC), where a new block is added every two and a half minutes, four times faster than Bitcoin).\n\nAlthough adjusting these parameters (size and time) can improve network efficiency (more transactions could be conducted per unit of time). However, doing so could compromise network security, as this is based on the computational effort required from the nodes (proof-of-work consensus algorithm).\n\nIncreasing the block size and slashing the time it takes for a block to join the network would inevitably result in higher demand on the computational capacity of the nodes involved in blockchain mining. It is now quite common to find clusters of computers working together as a team, in what are known as \u201cmining farms\u201d, attempting to complete the proof of work (process for determining the entity that will add the next block to the blockchain).\n\nAs the number of Bitcoin network users increases \u2013 the more people attempting to solve the proof-of-work puzzle, the easier it is to solve, meaning that in order to maintain the 10-minute cadence, the difficulty must be increased.\n\nIn extreme circumstances, a small group of mining farms could even come to dominate the network. One of blockchain's security fundamentals stems from the existence of a high number of nodes that individually ensure that the network functions properly: accurate information, non-corruption and immutable information. If a smaller cluster of nodes is in control, this could prevent the blockchain network from working properly. A 51% attack refers to a type of attack on a blockchain network that allows a malicious miner, who holds more than 50% of the computational power (hash rate), to take control of the mining. This way, mining farms agree on which information (or transactions) are written (or executed) on the Blockchain.\n\nThe more nodes there are, the more decentralised the blockchain becomes. Increasing the number of blocks per unit of time or increasing the size of the block in the pursuit of efficiency ends up increasing the cost of maintaining the node, meaning that nodes fall in number and the network therefore becomes less decentralised.\n\nUltimately, the violation of the principle of decentralisation and the potential for the emergence of oligopolies in the pursuit of greater efficiency may diminish the security of the blockchain compared to that which was initially established. As is often the case, the fact that a technology is born based on the improvement of existing systems does not imply that it can be used other than initially intended. The need to regulate or create legislation and case law on blockchain is also currently under debate, though this will have to be done based on the different uses derived from this technology."

        "title": "'There needs to be a health warning': How crypto trading can lead to addiction - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nIn the circle of a therapy session in an 18th century Scottish country house are half-a-dozen recovering addicts. Many recall, at their lowest points, battling chronic depression and contemplating suicide.\n\nThe patients, all male, share harrowing stories of dealing with a newfangled addiction: compulsive crypto trading. Some say their crypto addiction combined with an alcohol or drug habit, while others say they began by treating trading digital tokens much like gambling.\n\n\u201cI spent eight hours a day on Reddit reading [crypto] white papers, thinking I\u2019m making an intellectual decision . . . it was just ridiculous,\u201d said one patient.\n\nTheir plight goes to the heart of a dilemma for politicians around the world as they try to grapple with the impact of cryptocurrencies on their populations. Many lawmakers and companies are calling for it to be designated as a financial service, which would demand tough regulatory standards but offer consumers legal protections.\n\nIn an effort to establish London as a \u201chub\u201d for financial markets innovation, the British government has set out a sweeping framework for crypto that would bring it into line with established regulations for financial services.\n\nBut in the UK last month a report from a powerful cross-party group of MPs said crypto should be regulated like gambling; people were trading assets that had \u201cno intrinsic value\u201d and \u201cno discernible social good\u201d, it said.\n\nFor those treating the 70-odd patients at the private Castle Craig rehab centre outside Edinburgh, the change in emphasis cannot come soon enough.\n\nCrypto addicts describe their experience \u201cas any gambler would describe their gambling addiction\u201d, said Anthony Marini, Castle Craig\u2019s senior specialist therapist. \u201cSo, for me, should it be regulated as gambling? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nMore than 300 patients suffering from a form of crypto addiction have come through Castle Craig\u2019s doors since it opened up to crypto traders in 2018, calling itself the world\u2019s first specialist crypto addiction centre.\n\nAll hands went up during the group session when Marini asked if any patients had experienced symptoms such as suicidal ideation, chronic depression or hopelessness.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a health warning [on crypto exchanges] just like any gambling site,\u201d Marini said. \u201cPeople have lost families, people have lost their jobs, people have embezzled . . . there needs to be warnings and education that this can actually kill people.\u201d\n\nCentral to the report from the Treasury select committee were concerns that handing oversight of crypto to the UK\u2019s main markets regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, would give the impression that crypto is \u201csafer than it is\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was seeing crypto more as an investment, so in my head I wasn\u2019t gambling at first . . . but I don\u2019t think it really works like that,\u201d another gambling addict told the Financial Times.\n\nDuring the therapy session at Castle Craig, patients described using crypto trading apps that were built to encourage them to invest compulsively and chase a quick profit, echoing the rougher tactics of the early online betting industry, which has been tamed to some extent by more fines being meted out by the Gambling Commission.\n\nGaming companies are now compelled to offer customers access to self-exclusion technology, while crypto trading apps are not. UK online betting platforms will soon have to impose stake limits and conduct basic affordability checks on users, although how this will work is still subject to consultation.\n\nThe prospect of regulations that borrow from the gambling playbook would likely \u201ccut against\u201d the UK government\u2019s ambitions to become a hub for the sector, argued Paige Berges, anti-corruption and international risk counsel at law firm Ropes & Gray.\n\nCrypto companies have also hit out at its findings, saying it underplays crypto\u2019s potential benefits for the economy and consumers. British lobbying group CryptoUK calls the select committee report \u201cnot helpful\u201d.\n\nTrading venue GFO-X said: \u201cAll investors \u2014 whether retail or institutional \u2014 deserve access to orderly markets which establish price discovery, in the same way as other financial instruments or commodities. The rhetoric around crypto assets being classed as gambling is extremely unhelpful and provides worse customer outcomes.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the UK Treasury, responsible for developing the rules, has privately indicated it will not be swayed by the report.\n\n\u201cRisks posed by crypto are typical of those that exist in traditional financial services and it is financial services regulation \u2014 rather than gambling regulation \u2014 that has the record in mitigating them,\u201d said a recent email from the Treasury to the crypto industry and seen by the FT.\n\nBut there is growing evidence that the lines between crypto trading and gambling are blurred, and the worst consequences of overuse look strikingly similar.\n\nA 2019 study from researchers at Rutgers University that looked at 876 gamblers who bet at least once a month found that increased problem gambling severity among the cohort was \u201cstrongly associated\u201d with trading crypto.\n\n\u201cYour emotions are so attached to what the graph is doing, especially with crypto because it\u2019s 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I\u2019d be checking my phone at 3am, you lose sleep over it,\u201d said one patient at Castle Craig.\n\nDuring the week when the Terra stablecoin collapsed last May, the US National Council on Problem Gambling registered a record 19,000 users, the same number as a typical month. A 2023 study by the Blockchain Research Lab found that crypto users who also gamble tend to be \u201cyoung, male, well-educated and well-off\u201d.\n\nThe NHS National Problem Gambling Clinic, which launched in 2008, will hold its first clinic solely focused on addicted retail traders this month, and half of the dozen patients complain of compulsively trading crypto.\n\n\u201cThe three impacts we see from gambling are on mental health, finances and on relationships. In crypto trading, what we\u2019re seeing is exactly the same,\u201d said Anna Hemmings, chief executive officer of gambling support organisation GamCare.\n\nBut putting crypto in one legal basket and not another also brings problems. Berges at Ropes & Gray points out that treating it as gaming could have the result of \u201cputting crypto outside the scope of traditional financial services regulations\u201d.\n\nKahlil Philander, assistant professor at Washington State University who researches the crossover of crypto and gambling, said not maintaining some oversight by the FCA would be a mistake as crypto is \u201cpretty clearly a commodity or a security\u201d.\n\nAnother is that the Gambling Commission, the body that would be charged with overseeing crypto, is less well-resourced than the FCA, which has more than 4,000 staff.\n\nFor years, safer gambling campaigners have complained that the Gambling Commission\u2019s \u00a374mn budget and 300 staff are toothless in the face of the \u00a314bn UK gambling industry.\n\n\u201cThe gambling sector is large and growing in this country . . . so I think in the short term it would be very challenging for the Gambling Commission to take on crypto,\u201d said Hemmings.\n\nBut the two regulators are conscious that technology is blurring the lines between them and have pledged to work together. That was prompted two years ago by the failure of Football Index, an online betting company that styled itself as a stock market for football. It fell into administration, leaving thousands of customers unable to access their funds.\n\nThe Football Index collapse \u201ccould have been avoided not by the FCA replacing the Gambling Commission as the regulator, but by them working together\u201d, said Matt Zarb-Cousin, the director of Clean Up Gambling. \u201cThe same applies to crypto.\u201d\n\nBut for many addicts the regulatory turf war is a moot point and too late. As one patient at Castle Craig said: \u201cPut gambling and crypto side by side, look at the repercussions of both of them, look at the severity of both of them, and tell me they\u2019re not the same.\u201d"

Within a week of closing the acquisition, an order was subsequently placed to acquire 240 new bitcoin mining machines (Bitmain S19J Pro+) where were contracted to be delivered by the end of February. Due to manufacturer delays, those new machines were delivered just two weeks ago. After clearing customs and remitting required taxes and import duty fees, the new machines are in the process of being installed in two recently acquired containers that are currently being retrofitted for installation of these 240 new bitcoin mining machines.\n\nAt the same time, annual planned maintenance is being performed on the turbines and the six generators located at the Toro hydroelectric dam. The current timeline for full operations is scheduled to begin within two weeks on or about June 15, 2023.\n\nMr. Gary C. Evans, Chairman and CEO of Evergreen Sustainable Enterprises, Inc. stated, \"We are very anxious to get our first bitcoin mining operation up and running within the next two weeks. We have coordinated with our 20% equity partner to complete all planned annual maintenance of machinery at the hydroelectric dam during this down time period. This also coordinates with the end of the \"dry season\" in Costa Rica. We believe our new mining operations will be some of the lowest cost with the highest margins in the business due to controlling our power costs at approximately $0.02 per kWh. Based upon current financial modeling, our breakdown Bitcoin price is $10,145 whereas the bitcoin price is trading in the $27,000 range. When we made this investment back in January, Bitcoin prices were in the $16,000 range.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOur management team is continuing to negotiate additional site locations both in the U.S. and Costa Rica at sites where power prices are significantly below historical norms.\n\nAbout Evergreen Sustainable Enterprises, Inc. (f/k/a Generation Hemp, Inc)\n\nEvergreen Sustainable Enterprises, Inc. is a Dallas/Fort Worth based sustainable [green energy] asset company with operations in both the Bitcoin mining industry and the hemp industry.

        "content": "Bitcoin and other crypto tokens were back in the green on Friday on the back of optimism in the global economy after the progress in the US debt ceiling. Also, hopes of a standstill interest rate by the US Federal Reserve pushed the risk sentiments up among the traders.\n\nBitcoin was back in green on Friday as the largest crypto token was slightly up, flirting with the $27,000 mark during the day. Similarly, its largest peer, Ethereum, rose about a per cent as it regained $1,850 levels. A majority of altcoins were also trading higher, rising in tandem.\n\n\n\nCrypto markets have been range-bound in the last 24 hours. The crypto fear and greed index took a 2-point hit yesterday and remains in the neutral zone with 52 points. Investors continue to take a cautious approach toward crypto markets, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures.\n\n\n\n\"In other news, Nike Virtual Studios and EA Sports are partnering to bring Nike NFTs from its SWOOSH platform to the EA Sports gaming ecosystem. This is set to provide the audience with a more immersive experience and new levels of customization within the EA Sports ecosystem,\" he said.\n\nBarring the Shiba Inu and US dollar-pegged stablecoins, all other top crypto tokens were trading higher on Friday. Litecoin topped among the gainers with a more than 5 per cent rise, while Polygon, Avalanche and XRP gained 2 per cent. Cardano and Dogecoin were other top gainers.\n\n\n\nThe global cryptocurrency market cap was trading sharply higher, rising to $1.14 trillion-mark as it increased more than a per cent in the last 24 hours. However, the total trading volumes dropped over 15 per cent to $29.64 billion.\n\n\n\nWith the price dipping below the $27,000 mark. On-chain data reveals an interesting trend as smaller Bitcoin investors, known as 'shrimps', with wallet balances of less than 1 BTC have aggressively accumulated the largest crypto. Over the past month alone, the supply held by shrimps has risen by 24,600 BTC, reaching an all-time high of 1.31 million BTC, said CoinDCX Research Team.\n\n\n\n\"The European Union (EU) has taken a significant step towards regulating the crypto industry by signing into law the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework. Introduced in 2020, this framework aims to establish a robust regulatory system for crypto assets within the EU region. The law is set to go into effect in 2024, heralding the beginning of regulation for crypto firms operating in the EU,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech View by Giottus Crypto Platform\n\nPolygon (MATIC) is in a bearish trend though a rebound is likely with the asset holding support in longer timeframes. It is trading near $0.9 currently. The MATIC price trend is in a falling wedge pattern and is looking for a breakout, ideally back above $1.00 and its 200-day MA.\n\n\n\nIts RSI also has made a comeback in the past week and is moving upwards indicating an upcoming rally. However, like all altcoins, MATIC\u2019s price action depends on performance of BTC and financial markets. If MATIC fails to withhold the $0.82 support level, it could encounter renewed selling pressure.\n\n\n\nMajor Levels:\n\nSupport: $0.75, $0.82\n\nResistance: $0.95, $1.05\n\n\n\n\n\n(Views and recommendations given in this section are the analysts' own and do not represent those of Business Today.

        "content": "Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer\u2019s opinion.\n\nThe U.S. overwhelmingly passed the recent debt ceiling deal, giving markets a breather. But Bitcoin\u2019s [BTC] bearish sentiment persists after failing to flip bullish on the higher timeframe chart. It closed May in red, sustaining about 4% loss in monthly performance.\n\nDespite the price pump seen last weekend, BTC recorded $11 million outflows in short-Bitcoin in the same period. The trend marks the sixth consecutive outflow totaling over $270 million, according to Coinshares\u2019 Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly report.\n\nWhile this underscores the prevailing negative sentiment, declining volumes were also worrying.\n\nBTC\u2019s trendline resistance roadblock\n\nBTC price action has been making lower highs after price rejection at $31k in mid-April. A trendline resistance (white) has become a key roadblock on the daily chart, preventing BTC from flipping to bullish.\n\n\n\nA recent bullish breakout on 28 May faced rejection at the trendline resistance, setting BTC to retrace to the previous mid-range of $26.8k. Below the mid-range lies the 111-day MA (Moving Average) of $26.5k.\n\n\n\nThe 111-MA has checked three major drops so far. One in mid-March and two in May, making it a key dynamic support level. A breach below the MA and range low of $26.0k could offer sellers more upper hand, denting the bullish sentiment further.\n\nThe two support levels to watch out for in such an extended plunge are $25k and $24k.\n\nConversely, BTC could rebound at the mid-range, which aligns with $26.6k, a key support level in late March/April after the U.S. debt ceiling news.\n\nHowever, bulls must clear the trendline resistance roadblock to gain leverage. Northwards, resistance levels lay at $28.5k, $29.8k and $31k.\n\nCVD spot declines\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the BTC Profit Calculator\n\nTowards the end of May, CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) spot took a nosedive, declining steadily from 29 May to 1 June (as of press time). It reinforces the sellers\u2019 leverage seen in the past few days.\n\nWith the US debt ceiling out of the way, the focus now turns to the FOMC meeting in mid-June. In addition, the $28k level has been marked level by long-term BTC holders in profit and could remain a key obstacle for a while."

        "title": "How Long Does it Take to Mine 1 Bitcoin? - Bitcoin Australia",
        "content": "As a newcomer to the world of crypto, you may have heard about the process of Bitcoin mining and wondered how long it takes to mine 1 Bitcoin. In this blog post, we will delve into the fascinating world of Bitcoin mining, explore the inner workings of the Bitcoin network, and discover why Bitcoin mining remains an integral part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency that operates on a decentralised network, meaning it is not controlled by a central authority like a traditional bank or government. Instead, it relies on tens of thousands of computers around the world, known as nodes, to validate and secure transactions.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin:\n\nAs the popularity of Bitcoin continues to grow, so does its value. Bitcoin prices have been known to fluctuate, with some experts predicting that one Bitcoin could be worth millions of dollars in the future. This potential for growth has captured the imagination of investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nUnderstanding the Blockchain:\n\nThe blockchain is a public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions, ensuring transparency and security. Each block in the chain contains a list of transactions, which are verified by miners before being added to the blockchain.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Mining?\n\nBitcoin mining is the process of using powerful computers, called miners, to validate and secure transactions on the Bitcoin network. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems, and the first one to find the solution adds a new block to the blockchain, earning block rewards in the form of bitcoins.\n\nHow does Bitcoin Mining work?\n\nMiners earn rewards in two ways: block rewards and transaction fees. When a new block is added to the blockchain, the miner who successfully adds it receives a fixed amount of Bitcoins, known as the block reward. They also collect transaction fees from users who want to prioritise their transactions. While solo mining is possible, it is highly unlikely for a solo miner to successfully mine a block on their own. As a result, most miners join the largest Bitcoin mining pools to increase their chances of earning rewards.\n\nRisks of Bitcoin Mining:\n\nMining operations come with their own set of risks, such as the high electricity cost and the environmental impact of using non-renewable energy sources. Many crypto-mining facilities have started to explore renewable energy options, like solar or wind power, to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nWhy Do Bitcoins Need to be Mined?\n\nThe mining process is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the Bitcoin network. Without miners, transactions would be left unverified, and the decentralised nature of the network would be compromised.\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Mine 1 Bitcoin?\n\nThere are several factors that affect how long it takes to mine one Bitcoin. These include the mining hardware you\u2019re using, the mining difficulty, and whether you\u2019re part of a mining pool or operating solo. In general, it can take anywhere from several months to years for a mining operation to mine 1 Bitcoin, depending on these factors.\n\nMining Difficulty:\n\nAs more miners join the network and contribute their computing power, the Bitcoin network adjusts the mining difficulty to maintain a consistent rate of new blocks being added to the blockchain. The higher the mining difficulty, the more hash rate (or hashing power) is required to successfully mine a Bitcoin block. This means that as the network grows and more miners join, it becomes increasingly difficult for individual miners to compete and successfully mine a block.\n\nDifficulty of Bitcoin mining over the last 3 years (https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/difficulty)\n\nMining Hardware:\n\nThe type of mining equipment used can have a significant impact on how long it takes to mine one Bitcoin. High-performance mining hardware, such as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) miners, are designed specifically for mining and provide much greater computing power than traditional Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) miners. Consequently, miners with more powerful hardware have a higher chance of successfully mining a single block, reducing the time it takes to mine one Bitcoin.\n\nMining Pools:\n\nMining pools are groups of miners who combine their computing resources to increase their chances of mining a block. By working together, miners in a pool have a higher likelihood of finding a solution to the mathematical problem and receiving block rewards. The rewards are then split among the pool members according to the mining pool fees and their individual contributions. While mining pools increase the chances of success for miners, they also reduce the amount of Bitcoin each miner receives, potentially extending the time it takes to mine one Bitcoin.\n\nMining Software:\n\nEfficient mining software can help optimise mining performance, allowing miners to utilise more computing power and increase their chances of successfully mining a block. This can help reduce the time it takes to mine one Bitcoin, especially for miners with limited hardware resources.\n\nIs Mining Bitcoin in 2023 Profitable?\n\nDetermining whether Bitcoin mining is profitable in 2023 depends on factors such as the cost of electricity, mining hardware, and mining difficulty. As the price of bitcoin continues to fluctuate, so does the potential for profit. However, increasing mining difficulty and competition have made it more challenging for individual miners to turn a profit.\n\nImportant Bitcoin Mining terms:\n\nHash rate: The hash rate is a measure of the computational power used by miners to solve the mathematical problems required to mine a Bitcoin block.\n\nHash: A hash is a fixed-length output generated by a cryptographic function from input data (in this case, transaction data).\n\nPrevious block: In the blockchain, each block contains a reference to the previous block, creating a linked chain of blocks.\n\nMining rig: A mining rig is a specialised computer designed for mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nMining pool: A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their resources to increase their chances of mining a block and receiving block rewards.\n\nFAQ:\n\nHow do Bitcoin miners get paid?\n\nMiners are paid in two ways: block rewards, which are a fixed amount of bitcoins awarded to the miner who successfully mines a block, and transaction fees, which are collected from users who want to prioritise their transactions within the blockchain.\n\nHow many computers do you need to mine 1 Bitcoin?\n\nThe number of computers required to mine one Bitcoin depends on factors such as the mining hardware, mining difficulty, and whether you\u2019re mining solo or as part of a mining pool. In general, more powerful mining hardware and participation in a mining pool can increase the chances of successfully mining one Bitcoin.\n\nCan I mine Bitcoin on my laptop?\n\nWhile it is technically possible to mine Bitcoin using a laptop, most miners use specialised mining hardware, such as ASIC miners, which provide significantly more computational power. Mining on a laptop is not recommended, as it is unlikely to yield any significant rewards and can cause damage to your device due to overheating.\n\nCan you Mine Bitcoin for Free?\n\nThere are no truly \u201cfree\u201d methods of mining Bitcoin, as mining requires specialised hardware and consumes a significant amount of electricity, both of which come with associated costs.\n\nDo I get Taxed on Bitcoin Mining?\n\nTax regulations regarding Bitcoin mining vary by jurisdiction. In most countries, Bitcoin mining is considered a taxable event, and miners are required to report their earnings as income. It is essential to consult with a tax professional or research your local tax laws to understand your obligations as a Bitcoin miner.\n\nRemember, the world of cryptocurrencies is always changing, and staying informed is the best way to ensure you make informed decisions when it comes to investing, mining, or using digital currencies like Bitcoin. Good luck, and happy mining!"

        "content": "As Bitcoin experiences its first monthly loss in 2023, it\u2019s crucial to explore the similarities and differences between Bitcoin and another emerging cryptocurrency that is taking the crypto world by storm \u2013 Big Eyes Coin (BIG).\n\nWhile Bitcoin has long been the face of the crypto market, Big Eyes Coin aims to revolutionize the industry by combining meme coin appeal with a focus on community-driven utility and environmental protection. Not to forget that it plans to build a full-fledged ecosystem just like Bitcoin. In this article, we will delve into the key aspects of both Bitcoin and Big Eyes Coin, analyzing their goals, mechanisms, and potential impact on the crypto space.\n\nBitcoin (BTC): Pioneer Of The Cryptocurrency Realm\n\nBitcoin, often referred to as BTC, stands as the pioneer of cryptocurrencies. Introduced by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, Bitcoin has gained immense popularity and market dominance. It operates on a decentralized network called blockchain, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries.\n\nWith a limited supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin holds significant value and serves as a store of wealth for many investors. Its decentralized nature, coupled with strong security protocols, attracts individuals seeking financial sovereignty and protection against inflation. Despite facing market volatility, Bitcoin has consistently rebounded and demonstrated resilience, fostering trust among its user base.\n\nThe BIG Bridge Between Memes, Community, And Sustainability\n\nBig Eyes Coin, on the other hand, takes a unique approach to the crypto industry. This meme-inspired cryptocurrency combines the allure of meme coins with a strong emphasis on community engagement and environmental conservation. The project revolves around Big Eyes, a cat with big eyes, who embarked on a global journey to raise awareness about ocean conservation and blockchain.\n\nBy leveraging non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and a crypto casino, Big Eyes Coin aims to create an ecosystem that fosters rapid growth while offering exclusive content and events to its community. Members are rewarded with tokens, NFTs, and early access to news and updates, promoting active participation and ownership within the ecosystem. Moreover, the project\u2019s commitment to charitable causes further amplifies its appeal, resonating with individuals who seek meaningful investments.\n\nThe Showdown: Bitcoin Vs. Big Eyes Coin\n\nWhile Bitcoin and Big Eyes Coin operate within the same cryptocurrency realm, they have distinct features and objectives. Bitcoin, as the market leader, primarily focuses on establishing itself as a decentralized digital currency and a long-term store of value. Its limited supply and proven track record attract both institutional investors and individual enthusiasts seeking to secure their wealth.\n\nIn contrast, Big Eyes Coin positions itself as a community-driven meme coin with a strong emphasis on environmental protection and charitable causes. It aims to engage users through exclusive content and events, leveraging the appeal of its mascot \u2013 the Big Eyes cat. By combining meme culture with a purpose-driven approach, Big Eyes Coin seeks to capture the interest of meme coin lovers and investors looking for both entertainment and utility.\n\nAs Bitcoin faces its first monthly loss in 2023, it\u2019s essential to explore alternative cryptocurrencies that offer unique value propositions. While Bitcoin remains a prominent player in the crypto market, Big Eyes Coin introduces an innovative approach by merging meme coin appeal with community engagement and environmental protection. Both Bitcoin and Big Eyes Coin cater to distinct audiences, each with its own investment preferences and objectives.\n\nBy examining the dynamics of these cryptocurrencies, investors and meme coin enthusiasts can make well-informed decisions, considering factors such as market trends, utility, and long-term sustainability. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, understanding the similarities and differences between cryptocurrencies becomes crucial for navigating this exciting and rapidly changing landscape.\n\nBig Eyes Coin (BIG)\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: Telegram: Contact @BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/BigEyesCoin/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "As Bitcoin (BTC) is still trying to move closer to the psychologically important level of $28,000, the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset is starting to show slightly positive signs, suggesting further move up could be in store by the end of June.\n\nIn this context, Finbold has consulted the machine learning algorithm over at the cryptocurrency analytics and forecast platform PricePredictions, which has set the price of Bitcoin for June 30, 2023, at $27,540.35, according to the information seen on June 2.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price forecast. Source: PricePredictions\n\nIf these projections, based on indicators like moving average convergence divergence (MACD), average true range (ATR), Bollinger Bands (BB), and others, are to materialize, the predicted price would represent a 1.59% increase to the current price of Bitcoin, which at the time of publication was changing hands at $27,110.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nIndeed, the price of the maiden crypto asset at press time suggests a daily gain of 0.96%, as well as climbing 2.28% over the previous seven days, as it records a loss of 5.42% across the past month, according to the latest charts retrieved on June 2.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAt the same time, the technical analysis (TA) gauges on the finance and crypto market analytics platform TradingView are somewhat mixed, with an optimistic 1-week sentiment that suggests a \u2018buy\u2019 at 11, as moving averages (MA) point at a \u2018buy\u2019 at 9 and oscillators are in the \u2018neutral\u2019 area. On the other hand, 1-day gauges indicate a \u2018sell.\u2019\n\nBitcoin technical analysis 1-week gauges. Source: TradingView\n\nAll things considered, Bitcoin\u2019s capability to reach the projected price will depend on multiple factors and indicators. For instance, the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA), support and resistance levels, 200-day EMA, and the 0.382 ratio Fibonacci level suggest that the price of Bitcoin could drop to as low as $23,000, as Finbold reported on June 1.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
