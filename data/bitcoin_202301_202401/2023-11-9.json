        "title": "Bitcoin approaches $38,000 and Ethereum crosses $2,000 as ETF fever continues to buoy the crypto market - Fortune",
        "content": "The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization continued to push past year-long highs, as Bitcoin approached $38,000 late Thursday morning, an approximately 7% increase in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Its peak of $37,935 was the highest the coin has reached in more than 18 months.\n\nEther, the token for the Ethereum blockchain and second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was also up, crossing the $2,000 mark for the first time since July on the back of an 8% day-over-day price upswing.\n\nThe market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies increased approximately 5.4% day-over-day to $1.45 trillion, as some of the other largest coins on the market saw large gains as of Thursday morning, including Cardano (8.2%), Solana (9.9%), and Chainlink (12.7%). The movements in the crypto markets far outpaced the stock indices, with the NASDAQ and S&P 500 basically flat over the past 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent upswing is mainly due to \u201coptimism around a near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approval and a resulting short-squeeze,\u201d Brian Rudick, a senior strategist at crypto trading firm GSR, told Fortune, referring to a Bitcoin-based financial product that traditional investors can trade. And on Thursday morning, BlackRock registered the name \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust\u201d in Delaware, an indication \u201cthat it is likely to file a spot ether ETF application soon,\u201d he added.\n\nDavid Lawant, head of research at crypto brokerage and trading platform FalconX, echoed Rudick\u2019s assessment. Bitcoin \u201ccontinues to perform well as the market focuses on the U.S. spot ETF approval process,\u201d he told Fortune, adding that the \u201cbig star of the day\u201d has been Ethereum, following news of BlackRock\u2019s registration of the \u201ciShares Ethereum Trust\u201d name.\n\nThe rapid rise in the prices of major cryptocurrencies continues a month-long rally in the digital assets market. The total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies has rocketed about 30% since Oct. 9, rising alongside optimism over the likely approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, or exchange-traded fund.\n\nTraditional investors, who manage trillions of dollars in capital, are largely constrained by the investment products available on portfolio management platforms like Vanguard or TD Ameritrade. If the Securities and Exchange Commission were to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, which lets traditional investors trade on current Bitcoin prices, crypto industry boosters are betting that tremendous amounts of capital would flow into the Bitcoin\u2014and crypto\u2014markets.\n\nWhile the industry has repeatedly tried and failed to convince the SEC to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, filed an application for its own spot Bitcoin ETF in June. Since then, the crypto markets have rallied, and other financial institutions have filed their own ETF applications, hoping to cash in if the SEC were to approve the application from BlackRock, which has a sterling record of past ETF approvals.\n\nAnd starting Thursday, a brief period for the SEC to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF opened, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts, who believe that, even if approvals don't come in November, there is a 90% chance of approval by January.\n\n\"There is significant hype surrounding the recent comments from Bloomberg regarding the ETF 'window,'\" James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, told Fortune. \"Admittedly, it is always a little worrying when prices rise so sharply. That said, as we enter into this new bull market, it is worth reflecting on the point that we remain well below the all-time-highs seen in 2021.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin's Lightning Network: 3 Possible Problems - Investopedia",
        "content": "The Lightning Network is a second layer added to Bitcoin's network, enabling transactions between parties off the main blockchain\u2014called off-chain transactions. Lightning Network has often been advertised as a game-changer in the cryptocurrency's evolution. It is designed to speed up transaction processing times and decrease the associated costs of Bitcoin's blockchain. The lightning network was conceived by two developers, Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon in 2015.\n\nAlthough the Lightning Network has experienced growth and development since its inception, challenges remain. Bitcoin's price fluctuations have prevented the crypto from becoming a widespread payment method for consumer and business transactions. Also, there are costs involved in using Lightning Network.\n\nHere, we highlight what the Lightning Network is designed to solve and three problems that it faces. Also, we review recent developments that could impact and improve the network in the future.\n\nKey Takeaways The Lightning Network is a second layer added to Bitcoin's network, enabling transactions to be done off of the blockchain.\n\nThe Lightning Network is designed to speed up transaction processing times and decrease the associated costs of Bitcoin's blockchain.\n\nHowever, the Lightning Network still has costs associated with it and can be susceptible to fraud or malicious attacks.\n\nBitcoin's price swings may prevent the crypto from becoming a popular payment method, limiting the use of the Lightning Network.\n\nUnderstanding the Lightning Network\n\nAs Bitcoin gains transaction volume, more are processed on its blockchain network. This presents problems because the blockchain, in its current state, isn't designed to scale or process the volume of transactions being made.\n\nBitcoin's Scalability Issue\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain and network are designed to process one block about every 10 minutes. Transactions are sent into a work queue, where they are prioritized by how much the user paid in fees. The more transactions there are, the larger the queue is.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin has faced a scalability issue, meaning there are challenges when the network tries to process more transactions simultaneously. For Bitcoin to process more data, the network needs to scale, allowing more transactions to be processed quicker and more efficiently.\n\nThis network latency has led to higher transaction fees as miners take longer to validate transactions because users pay more to prioritize them.\n\nWhat It Is Designed to Do\n\nThe Lightning Network is a separate blockchain that works in conjunction with Bitcoin's blockchain. In a nutshell, the Lightning Network allows participants to transfer bitcoins between one another much quicker using payment channels. Channels can remain open for further payments or closed when a transaction is complete. Instead of waiting for the main network to get through its work queue for the payment to transfer (sometimes taking more than an hour), the Lightning Network lets users send and receive payments in seconds.\n\n1. It Does Not Solve Bitcoin\u2019s Transaction Fee Problem\n\nLightning Network is often touted as a solution to the problem of Bitcoin\u2019s rising transaction fees. Its proponents claimed that transaction fees, one of the direct consequences of Bitcoin\u2019s clogged network, would come down after the technology took transactions off the main blockchain.\n\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s congestion is among several factors influencing its transaction fees. When the Lightning Network was integrated in 2018, expectations for reduced costs and faster transactions were high among users\u2014but as the graph below shows, average Bitcoin transaction fees increased. There could be many reasons for this, but it demonstrates how ineffective the Lightning Network was at reducing fees.\n\nBlockchain.com\n\nLightning Network Fees\n\nIn addition to standard on-chain transaction charges, users are charged for opening a channel with a routing node. The routing node operator charges fees for providing the Lightning channel to the main network. Fees consist of a base fee and a rate, both chosen by the operator. The base fee remains consistent unless manually changed, and the rate is a percentage of the transaction value.\n\nSo, a node operator could set the base fee at one satoshi and the rate at 0.1%. If a user wanted to send 1,000 satoshi via this node, they would need to pay 2 satoshi to the node (fees on the Lightning Network can be measured in increments of milli-satoshi, so the payments can actually be very small).\n\nLightning fees are generally low because hosting a node is a competitive endeavor. Fees must be low enough to attract users but high enough to bring some benefit to the host. If they are too low, there might be no reason to operate a node\u2014if they are too high, users will likely choose a lower-priced node.\n\nInterestingly (and regardless of node fees), by design, the Lightning Network incorporates fees to try and lower overall fees.\n\n2. Remaining Online at All Times Makes Nodes Susceptible\n\nNodes on the Lightning Network are required to be online at all times to send and receive payments. Since the parties involved in the transaction must be online and use their private keys to sign in, it's possible that the coins could be stolen if the computer hosting the node was compromised.\n\nOffline Transaction Risk\n\nGoing offline creates its own set of problems on the Lightning Network. According to Dryja, it is possible for one of the two parties from a payment channel to close the channel and pocket funds while the other is away. This is known as a Fraudulent Channel Close. There is a period to contest the closing of a channel, but a prolonged absence by one of the parties could result in the expiry of that period.\n\nMalicious Attacks\n\nAnother risk to the network is congestion caused by a malicious attack. If the payment channels become congested, and there's a malicious hack or attack, the participants may not be able to get their money back fast enough due to the congestion.\n\nAccording to Dryja, \"forced expiration of many transactions may be the greatest systemic risk when using the Lightning Network.\"\n\nIf a malicious party creates numerous channels and forces them to expire simultaneously, which would broadcast to the blockchain, the congestion caused could overwhelm the capacity of the block. A malicious attacker might use the congestion to steal funds from parties who are unable to withdraw their funds due to the congestion.\n\n3. Bitcoin's Price Fluctuations\n\nThe Lightning Network is also supposed to herald Bitcoin's viability as a medium for daily transactions. Customers are able to open payment channels with businesses or people they transact with frequently. For example, they can open payment channels with their landlord or favorite e-commerce store and transact using bitcoins.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin has less traction as a mainstream payment method than as an investment instrument. The increase in transaction volume is primarily attributed to a rise in trading volume. In other words, Bitcoin's popularity with traders and investors increases its volatility\u2014or price fluctuations\u2014as well as congesting the network and influencing fee increases.\n\nRecent Lightning Network Developments\n\nThere remain challenges with Bitcoin's Lightning Network and its ability to boost scale while simultaneously lowering transaction fees. However, the technology's core team has incorporated new use cases and has been researching additional features. As a result, there have been significant developments that attempt to improve the network.\n\nLarger Payments Via Lightning Network\n\nLightning had initially limited channel size to a maximum of 0.1677 BTC, but in 2020, it was announced that the constraints would be removed so clients could have larger channels. These \"Wumbo\" channels are designed to increase the usage and utility of Lightning Network for consumers and businesses.\n\nCrypto Exchanges\n\nOne of the most promising initial use cases involves cryptocurrency exchanges and financial services platforms. For instance, Kraken and Block's Cash App have integrated the Lighting Network. In September 2023, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced the exchange would integrate the Lightning Network. As one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, this is a significant development for the network.\n\nWatchtowers\n\nWatchtowers are third parties that run to prevent fraud within the Lightning Network. For example, if Sam and Judy are transacting and one of them has malicious intent, they may be able to steal the coins from the other participant by closing the channel.\n\nSo, say Sam and Judy put up an initial deposit of 10,000 BTC, and a transaction of 3,000 BTC has taken place in which Sam purchased goods from Judy. If Judy logs off her system, it is open to possible fraud. Sam could broadcast the initial state, meaning they both get their initial deposits back as if no transactions were done. In other words, Sam would have received 3,000 BTC worth of goods for free.\n\nThis process of closing the channel based on the initial state versus the final state in which all of the transactions have been done is called a fraudulent channel close. The watchtower monitors transactions and prevents fraudulent channel closes by forcing a close on the offending party. It broadcasts a revocation transaction and causes them to forfeit their channel balance to the other party.\n\nIs the Lightning Network Part of Bitcoin? The Lightning Network is a layer 2 (a blockchain that assists a primary blockchain) for the Bitcoin blockchain. It was integrated with Bitcoin in 2018.\n\nHow Do You Use the Bitcoin Lightning Network? To complete transactions using the Bitcoin Lightning Network, you will need to use a Lightning-compatible wallet.\n\n\n\nHow Fast Is the Bitcoin Lightning Network? The Lightning Network can reportedly process millions of transactions per second. The main Bitcoin blockchain can process around seven a second.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Lightning Network is a tool that could make a significant difference to Bitcoin's blockchain. However, the network might not solve all of the challenges Bitcoin faces. While improvements are being made, there's the potential for new problems within the cryptocurrency's ecosystem because it remains an ever-evolving technology.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Here's Why Bitcoin and Ethereum Are Back From the Dead - New York Magazine",
        "content": "Is bitcoin back? Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer\n\nFor the entirety of crypto\u2019s existence, a large part of digital currency\u2019s appeal was how strange it all was. From its 2008 inception, bitcoin was this new kind of anti-government money, perfect for someone to buy drugs with online anonymously, even as it was susceptible to getting lost or thrown out on garbage day. There were the copycat fads \u2014 the \u201cinitial coin offering\u201d bubble of 2017, the shitcoin mania of 2021 \u2014 as well as the truly weird and dumb stuff, like the NFTs of monkeys that were, briefly, fodder for the art world. Whatever your opinion of all these things, they made many people very, very rich \u2014 at least for a little while, on paper. This year, though, has been different. After last year\u2019s market collapse and last week\u2019s conviction of crypto-fraud kingpin Sam Bankman-Fried, what\u2019s weird about it all isn\u2019t some new trend or some new offense to good taste. On Thursday, crypto had one of its best days in 18 months, and it has everything to do with abandoning its rebel origins and getting approval from Wall Street giants and government regulators.\n\nA single bitcoin rose briefly to nearly $38,000 on Thursday, the highest that it\u2019s been since the early days of the total market collapse triggered by the vaporization of two of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrencies, terraUSD and luna, in early 2022. Why did it rise from the dead all of a sudden? Crypto investors have a big new story to tell \u2014 and since the price of bitcoin isn\u2019t tied to a physical asset, like oil, or the economic might of a country, like the U.S. dollar, it lives and dies by how persuasive its story is on any given day. This time, the narrative seems to be about crypto growing up and getting a haircut, a suit, and a real job \u2014 on Wall Street. Specifically, the Securities and Exchange Commission appeared to be getting closer to green-lighting an exchange-traded fund from investment behemoth BlackRock that would allow investors to buy bitcoin as easily as they buy the S&P 500. (An ETF trades just like a stock but can represent an index or commodity or a nearly endless variety of other financial bets.) And it wasn\u2019t just bitcoin. Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-most-popular crypto, was also reaching highs not seen since April, topping $2,000 per token, after BlackRock registered a corporate entity in Delaware for an ethereum ETF.\n\nBitcoin is at $37,000 and no one is talking about it. Nobody is saying anything!\n\n\n\nHas anyone checked the price?\n\n\n\nWhy is no one tweeting about crypto?\n\n\n\nHello?\n\n\n\nBitcoin is up a lot!\n\n\n\nDoesn\u2019t anyone see it? \u2014 Zack Voell (@zackvoell) November 9, 2023\n\nFor Wall Street to finally start trading ETFs of bitcoin or ethereum would truly begin a new era in the world of cryptocurrencies. ETFs are part of the finance industry\u2019s lifeblood, and an industry unto itself that, as of last year, was worth $6.5 trillion. At its core, a crypto ETF would make it easier for financial institutions (your pensions, mutual funds, hedge funds, and the like), and the average 401(k) holder, to easily trade and profit from the digital currencies without having to worry about encryption keys, or getting hacked, or anything like that. (At least, not directly. If BlackRock got its bitcoin hacked, though, that would be very bad.) Bitcoin ETFs have largely been a pipe dream for the last ten years, since the Winklevoss twins first tried to get government approval for one. (The SEC rejected it four years later.) What changed recently was a lawsuit from Grayscale, a company owned by Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group, a big (if currently troubled) player in the crypto space. In August, an appeals court ruled that the SEC had arbitrarily denied Grayscale\u2019s application for its own ETF, which would have used many of the same market-surveillance and safety protocols that other funds used. Last month, the SEC said it wouldn\u2019t appeal the decision, making the appearance of an ETF all but assured. \u201cThis was fully expected in my eyes and was just a matter of when, not if,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said. \u201cBut BlackRock\u2019s name is obviously huge and just seeing this registration in Delaware sent ether prices skyrocketing.\u201d\n\nAll this appears to fly in the face of what made crypto so \u2026 crypto-y. This was, after all, the money that was most closely associated with Occupy Wall Street and that Jamie Dimon has called a \u201cfraud.\u201d The spike in prices is of the kind that would typically come from secret, anonymous Telegram \u201cpump\u201d groups that would disappear just as soon as they made their profits. That its value is getting pumped because regulators are now okay with it and the likes of BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion in assets, are getting in on it, is deeply weird and hilarious \u2014 not only because it\u2019s the opposite of what it symbolized for so long, but because \u2026 what\u2019s the difference? For most people who own a bitcoin, what matters is that the price is going to go higher (a.k.a. \u201cnumber go up\u201d), not any of the high-flying rhetoric about its ability make each holder a sovereign wealth fund unto themselves. Maybe this is why Gary Gensler, the SEC chair and chief antagonist of the crypto markets, came out recently and suggested that FTX could soon get relaunched as a crypto exchange, now that Bankman-Fried is no longer a threat. After his remarks, the price of FTX\u2019s digital currency, long assumed to be dead by most investors, spiked by 90 percent \u2014 one of its best days ever."

However, its mid-week surge hasn\u2019t seen the momentum loss of previous rallies this year, he added.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of breakout move that frequently leads to an even bigger advance before long,\u201d Maley said.\n\nTo be sure, bitcoin and the crypto markets are heavily driven by derivatives trading and that can exaggerate market activity in either direction.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, crypto trading volume has doubled to $87 billion as of noon New York time. For the same period, $132 million in trader positions shorting bitcoin have been liquidated, according to crypto derivatives source Coinglass.\n\nThe size of total short liquidations is far smaller than past so-called short squeeze fueled rallies that bitcoin has experienced this year, suggesting that more investors are directly buying the underlying/spot asset.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for the latest crypto news, updates, values, prices, and more related to bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin, DeFi, and NFTs\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

The rise in bitcoin price triggered a wave of short liquidations overnight, which propelled crypto prices higher, said Clara Medalie, head of research at crypto data provider Kaiko.\n\nThe website for Delaware's Division of Corporations showed that an iShares Ethereum Trust was registered on Thursday. A similar notice for the iShares Bitcoin Trust came on June 8, one week before BlackRock's filing for a bitcoin ETF. BlackRock declined to comment on the matter.\n\nEther was last higher by nearly 7.48% at $2,037.61, according to Coin Metrics. Meanwhile, bitcoin added 2.67% to trade at $36,574.83. Earlier, it climbed as high as $37,970, its highest level since May 2022.\n\nThe price of ether jumped Thursday, topping the key $2,000 level for the first time since April, after BlackRock took initial steps toward filing for a spot ether ETF.\n\n\"Over the past year, crypto markets have been desperately searching for a catalyst amid a sea of bad news, and the ETF news have been a welcome respite,\" she said. \"Should [an ETF approval] come, we may see another big surge, or we could be witnessing the extent of it right now. Ultimately, it is too early to tell if the rally has legs, but things look promising.\"\n\nHowever, with the exception of ether, prices across the crypto market retreated midday. Ryan Rasmussen, analyst at Bitwise Asset Management, noted that leverage and open interest ballooned on the sharp move towards $38,000 and then evaporated almost instantly on the pullback.\n\n\"That's a reflection of traders on both sides \u2014 bulls and bears \u2014 getting whipsawed by the sharp price movements,\" he said. \"Any time leverage builds like that in either direction, it's at risk of getting wiped out. I think it's fair to expect more volatility as prices rise \u2014 bull markets don't go up in a straight line.\"\n\nBitcoin has seen $134.41 million in short liquidations over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass, and $41.12 million in long liquidations in the same period.\n\nOther crypto assets rode the bitcoin price wave Thursday, also coming off their highs of the day. Solana , one of the biggest outperformers in crypto this year, added 2.69% after jumping 11% earlier. Most other tokens gave back earlier gains and ended the day flat.\n\nSeparately, FTT, the token tied to the now defunct FTX, spiked by 51% after SEC chair Gary Gensler told CNBC a revival of the exchange could work if new leadership does so with a clear understanding of the law.\n\nIn equities, shares of crypto services provider Coinbase and bitcoin proxy Microstrategy gained 5.1% and 4.1%, respectively. Among the bitcoin miners, Marathon Digital was up 8%, while Riot was flat. Both stocks gave back double digit gains.\n\n\u2014CNBC's Jesse Pound contributed reporting.\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\n\nCorrection: The price of bitcoin topped $37,000 for the first time since May 2022. An earlier version of this story misstated the time interval."

        "title": "Bitcoin and Global Hegemony - Geopoliticalmonitor.com",
        "content": "Both empirical realities and existing predictions show the usefulness and potential of Bitcoin as an instrument of national power in the practice of statecraft and also as a versatile element that could serve various roles under confrontational geopolitical conditions. However, it is unclear at this point if BTC and similar nonstate cybercurrencies could influence the fate of global hegemony. The historical record shows a strong symbiotic connection between the architecture of international monetary systems and political realities related to the global balance of power and the systemic structure of polarity. Specifically, major reserve currencies have always been issued by hegemonic great powers and underwritten by the strength that those superior positions confer. Such has been the case since the days of the Athenian drachma, the Roman denarius and the Byzantine solidus to the US dollar. In this regard, could the disruptiveness of unofficial cryptocurrencies like BTC have implications for the evolution of hegemony and the redistribution of the global correlation of forces in the coming decades? Admittedly, there is no hard conclusive evidence at this point but, from a long-range perspective, their existence is a relatively recent phenomenon, and the ultimate extent of their conceivable geopolitical ramifications remains unknown. After all, the arc of the so-called longue dur\u00e9e brings both predictable cyclical patterns and wild cards whose behaviour is hard to anticipate. Therefore, the formulation of an answer requires the practice of strategic foresight to assess multiple hypothetical possibilities and to determine how each could reshape hegemony. In order to do so, the present analysis integrates the scrutiny of forecasts, scenarios and perspectives. In particular, it seeks to identify the plausible implications of said cybercurrency for the hegemonic position still held by the United States as the leading superpower and the supremacy of the US dollar as the world\u2019s top reserve currency.\n\nBTC\u2019s potential as a major reserve currency\n\nThe idea of a major global reserve currency not controlled by any national state is not new. In the context of the Bretton Woods conference, British economist John Maynard Keynes proposed the idea of launching a supranational monetary unit, called \u201cBancor,\u201d which would be backed by gold, a plan that was \u2012 unsurprisingly \u2012 not welcomed by Washington. No sane statesmen would have missed the opportunity to achieve global monetary and financial superiority as a war booty. In the post-Cold War era, the rise of Bitcoin endorses once more the hypothetical scenario of a de-nationalized global currency that cannot be unilaterally controlled in accordance with the particular interests of a single state. Hence, some observers believe that the dollar\u2019s hegemonic position will not be inherited by another national currency, but by an unconventional new generation of monetary assets and \u2012 as the most emblematic cybercurrency \u2012 Bitcoin could become one of the largest reserve currencies. In fact, since it was created, Bitcoin\u2019s staunchest supporters have entertained the libertarian dream of a borderless currency that is freely available to everybody as an alternative to fiat money, seen as inherently inferior and problematic in all meaningful respects.\n\nThe introduction of stateless cryptocurrencies like BTC represents a potential catalyst for the renewal of the global monetary order or, at the very least, for a growing diversification. In theory, a virtual currency like Bitcoin could evolve and potentially act as an item that performs all the roles associated with money on a global scale: medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value. In fact, Bitcoin\u2019s promoters contend that it represents a game changer that offers many advantages over traditional currencies and even gold: algorithmic programming, transnational circuits and apolitical governance. Furthermore, as its organic financial ecosystem has grown, it has attracted the involvement of mainstream economic agents \u2012 including online retail business platforms, start-up companies, traditional financial firms and exchanges \u2012 increasing its projection well beyond the narrow confines of marginal sectors. At some point, BTC could gain a much higher degree of traction for all sorts of cross-border payments, even though it would have to face meaningful regulatory obstacles. Such development would challenge not just the dollar\u2019s hegemony, but also the legitimacy of other economic paradigms such as fiat money and fractional reserve banking.\n\nYet, the idea that BTC will become a major reserve currency should not be taken for granted. There are reasonable doubts motivated by technical, economic and political obstacles. Since Bitcoin\u2019s structural design determines that no more than 21 million units can exist, this limited money supply does not offer the volume that a reserve currency would need to play a much larger role in international commercial or financial transactions through systemic platforms. Despite the hype around them, unofficial cryptocurrencies are innovations still in their developmental infancy and none of them has been technically designed to act as a universal currency. Another important factor is the volatile fluctuations of Bitcoin\u2019s exchange rates. Said instability is problematic because rather than an item that performs reliably as international money, Bitcoin behaves more like an unstable speculative asset with no intrinsic worth that is traded for quick profits and usually exchanged for more traditional forms of wealth. Notably, its sceptics even argue that Bitcoin might trigger a speculative bubble whose eventual collapse would mirror the proportions and trajectory of the \u2018tulipmania\u2019 speculative frenzy that took place in the Dutch Golden Age, back when Amsterdam operated as the world\u2019s top financial nerve center.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most important difficulty is that BTC lacks the political support of a powerful state. In order to reach a much higher degree of international projection, it would require a measure like its adoption as some sort of anchor for a hard currency, either national or regional. Without such ingredient, its strength would be feeble. No currency in world history has become dominant on a global scale without the active backing of a great power. In contrast, as the American private intelligence firm STRATFOR observes, the dollar is underwritten by the full national power of the United States, including its military capabilities, manpower, economic wealth, infrastructure, institutional systems, land, culture and infrastructure. Needless to say, Bitcoin does not have anything even remotely comparable. In addition, most national states are unlikely to relinquish the benefits that come with their sovereign ability to control the implementation of their own monetary policies.\n\nIn a nutshell, the predictions about a widespread global adoption of Bitcoin are, at best, premature. The potential of any first-generation cybercurrency \u2012 including BTC \u2012 to become a major reserve currency in the near future is regarded as negligible by most experts. Specifically, Bitcoin is no suitable candidate to overtake the American dollar any time soon. In the best-case scenario, BTC could be a minor reserve currency. However, the prospect of their increased international presence in the long run could incrementally downsize the strategic advantages that the US gets as a result of the dollar\u2019s hegemonic position and even provide an instrument of statecraft to advance a partial de-dollarization. As such, their potential condition as alternative or secondary reserve currencies is worth considering, especially in an environment of heightened financial and geopolitical turmoil.\n\nBTC as a vector of a counter-hegemonic grand strategy\n\nThe growing international projection of decentralized cybercurrencies like Bitcoin is a trend that could create a much more fragmentary, horizontal and plural global monetary order. Another important systemic trajectory that needs to be highlighted is the rising great power competition in the strategic chessboard of money and finance. Considering their disruptive nature, crypto-assets have the theoretical potential to challenge the position held by the dollar as the hegemonic currency since Bretton Woods and the collective West\u2019s ability to implement coercive sanctions. They could therefore be harnessed strategically by revisionist great powers that seek to encourage de-dollarization, further multipolarity and develop parallel monetary and financial systems. Some observers warn that the next major hegemonic confrontation might not involve military conflict in traditional battlefields, but competing financial structures. In turn, certain experts hold that, despite its ideological hostility to BTC\u2019s libertarian background, China might attempt to manipulate BTC in as an unconventional weapon in an attempt to target the dollar\u2019s prestige and challenge American global financial leadership. Such possibility has evident implications for American national security. These concerns are shared by prominent members of US high finance elite. American hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio has warned about an eventual \u201ccapital war\u201d as one of the facets of the increasingly complex rising rivalry between China and the US.\n\nInterestingly, Professor Nicholas Ross Smith argues that, as a great power that intends to rewrite the architecture of the global system, Russia could also be interested in the counter-hegemonic properties of Bitcoin as an instrument of statecraft that might foster a more multipolar correlation of forces. Moscow cannot directly compete with the US in the field of money, but it can rely on stateless cryptocurrencies as weaponized asymmetric vectors of grand strategy to diminish the international strength of the greenback. Said measure would reduce the power and influence of the US in the system of global financial and monetary governance and worsen American financial imbalances, including unsustainable levels of indebtedness. Moscow could even become a hub for independent cryptocurrencies like BTC. Moreover, it has been noted that the reassessment of Russia\u2019s initial reluctance to embrace cryptocurrencies towards a more permissive attitude is likely related to the Kremlin\u2019s strategic interest in alternatives worth leveraging to weaken the dollar. Another strategic advantage of nonstate cryptocurrencies for Russian national interests would be their pragmatic applications for compensating the prospect of an overreliance on Chinese financial platforms connected to the renminbi.\n\nHowever, it is not entirely clear is such course of action could achieve the expected outcome. There are limits that China and/or Russia would have to be overcome in order to sponsor a much larger presence of Bitcoin in cross-border payments, including the need to develop an accompanying financial infrastructure. Another disadvantage for Bitcoin to achieve a much stronger international role is this cryptocurrency\u2019s high levels of financial volatility. Although this strategy could be helpful to avert financial and monetary arteries controlled by the United States, it is unlikely to displace the dollar. At best, it could partially erode its position, but not sink the greenback.\n\nBTC as an element that could strengthen \u2018Pax Americana\u2019\n\nIn an article for Bitcoin Magazine, Luke Mikic puts forward the counterintuitive forecast that, rather than weakening it \u2012 as conventional wisdom would suggest \u2012 the growing monetization of BTC will actually extend the lifespan of the US dollar as the hegemonic reserve currency. In a context shaped by both the accumulation of structural financial problems and the rising assertiveness of revisionist states which actively seek to undermine the greenback\u2019s global supremacy, it would make sense to back the dollar with the leading cryptocurrency in order to hasten the renewal of the global monetary order with a dollar supported by BTC under Washington\u2019s leadership. Said analyst argues that a bitcoin-backed dollar would be able to overcome the challenge posed by the monetary alternatives being developed by China and, to a lesser extent, Russia. A report published by the Bitcoin Policy Institute states that BTC offers strategic advantages worth harnessing to strengthen the US position as the leading superpower. This source specifies that, rather than trying to suppress it, Washington should rely of BTC as an asset to support the development of technological innovation, expand capital markets, counter Beijing\u2019s efforts to boost RMB internationalization through its digital currency and FinTech projects, project the \u2018soft power\u2019 of American values and even finance opposition to hostile regimes. This course of action would reshuffle the global monetary order \u2012 with Bitcoin as its cornerstone, much like gold during the Bretton Woods era \u2012 in a favorable way for the US national interests. In this way, perhaps Washington could try to avert a hegemonic transition. If successful, such event would be a major \u2018black swan,\u2019 a surprising event whose impact would be felt for generations.\n\nBTC proliferation as a mirror that reflects a declining US hegemony\n\nBitcoin\u2019s symbolical significance has not gone unnoticed. It has been noted that its creation, in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, was a phenomenon driven \u2012 to a certain extent \u2012 by concerns about the trustworthiness of the dollar as the dominant reserve currency. According to Financial Times columnist Rana Foroohar, the rise of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies is a systemic trend that should not be interpreted as a temporary financial bubble. Instead, said commentator explains that, from a long-range perspective, the proliferation of such cybercurrencies represents a perception of growing skepticism about the US dollar \u2012 as a result of mounting levels of indebtedness and unsound monetary policies \u2012 and also as a symptom of a tectonic shift that favors an increasing geopolitical multipolarity. In other words, BTC symbolizes that a new global monetary and geopolitical order might be underway. Not long ago, Credit Suisse analyst Zoltan Pozsar anticipated that BTC will benefit from a new Bretton Woods, an era that will likely be shaped by a weaker dollar, a stronger renminbi, intensifying financial volatility and the growing presence of \u201coutside money,\u201d including gold and other commodities whose hardness is underpinned by their intrinsic value. In this interpretation, BTC and similar nonstate cybercurrencies herald a Zeitgeist of rising pluralism, both monetary and geopolitical.\n\nBTC as a source of inspiration to develop alternatives to the USD\n\nAs explained in a previous section, the potential of Bitcoin to overtake the US dollar is limited. However, its introduction could inspire a chain reaction that leads to the creation of later generations of virtual currencies \u2012 perhaps underpinned by monetary connections to hard assets such as gold and linked to their own digital financial infrastructures \u2012 intended to challenge the dollar\u2019s hegemony. For instance, James Rickards anticipates that China or Russia could hypothetically link BTC with gold as a measure to hasten the demise of the dollar. Interestingly, a report published by the Valdai Discussion Club, an influential Russian think tank, states that since cryptocurrencies are promising vehicles for cross-border settlements and payments, it is a matter of time before their current drawbacks are addressed through projects which offer innovative improvements. In a French book about the geopolitics of cryptocurrencies Nancy Gomez and Patrick Pasin even explore several hypothetical prospects of multilateral digital currencies for the BRICS bloc, the Russophone areas of the post-Soviet space under Moscow\u2019s leadership, the Latin American members of ALBA and even for nations of Turkic heritage, amongst others. In such a way, the intellectual influence of BTC could indirectly give birth to the design of alternative creations that do have the critical mass to compete with the greenback. Based on the extrapolation of current trends, it looks like the projects of the BRICS states, ASEAN nations and Middle Eastern oil exporters \u2012 along with other members of the so-called \u201cGlobal South\u201d \u2012 to de-dollarize their international economic exchanges are likely to take off in the coming years and newer generations of cutting-edge digital currencies could be involved in such pursuit. Regardless of what its creators intended and even if it cannot reshuffle the global balance of power by itself, BTC may have helped release the genie from the bottle and now there is no way to put it back. Yet, it is too soon to determine categorically if the monetary Rubicon has been crossed.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nAnticipating what the future might bring is always a challenging intellectual endeavor, but the analysis of plausible developments and scenarios to identify their potential strategic ramifications and assess their feasibility can be done based on historical precedents, a multidisciplinary worldview and the extrapolation of rising trends. Together, these exploratory predictions and perspectives give credence to the prospect that BTC and nonstate crypto-assets might be consequential in more than one way for the evolution of global hegemony.\n\nHowever, it would not be wise to overestimate the weight of their direct or indirect influence. By themselves, Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies lack the critical mass to alter the global balance of power. Yet, their pivotal significance in the eventual redefinition of the global order might be substantially increased if the international system\u2019s major powers (including both those that support the current status quo and those that harbor revisionist interests) harness them in their ongoing strategic competition. After all, money is \u2012 as German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche defined it \u2012 \u201cthe crowbar of power\u201d so it remains to be seen if stateless crypto-assets play a role as chess pieces in the greatest of all games: the pursuit of hegemony.\n\n**This article was originally published on April 11, 2023"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Price Predictions Are Unreliable - Investopedia",
        "content": "It's a phenomenon familiar to anyone who follows the cryptocurrency industry. A prominent figure\u2014the CEO of a digital currency exchange, a key developer or researcher, a successful cryptocurrency investor\u2014makes a dramatic prediction about the price of Bitcoin or the general movement of the digital currency sphere.\n\nAs is usually the case in the financial world, sometimes these predictions come to pass. But more often than not, these predictions never come to fruition. Nonetheless, many analysts and experts continue to make price predictions for Bitcoin and other digital currencies, and investors still seem to take heed.\n\nBelow, we'll explore why any cryptocurrency investor should take a price prediction with a good degree of skepticism.\n\nKey Takeaways Cryptocurrency investors should take a price prediction with a good degree of skepticism.\n\nOne of the major problems with many price predictions about bitcoin is that they lack sufficient analytical support to back up their claims.\n\nSome prominent figures in the industry who push for sky-high prices are doing so for reasons that may not be linked to fundamentals.\n\nBitcoin prices are mostly influenced by traders unless there is an event that triggers exuberant or panic investing.\n\nEasy to Believe\n\nOne of the major problems with many price predictions about Bitcoin is that they lack sufficient analytical support to back up their claims. An outlandish price point, particularly one in the upward direction, is always going to be tempting to investors; someone holding a cryptocurrency currently priced at $100 can easily be swayed to believe that the token will skyrocket to $10,000 simply because they want it to be true and it has happened in the past. However, the issue is that many predictions are delivered without evidence and proper analysis to support them.\n\nHype, Not Fundamentals\n\nIn many instances, cryptocurrency is overhyped by notable figures, business owners heavily invested in digital assets, or others who have an interest in profiting if prices rise. However, there are no fundamentals behind most cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo be fair, there are some bonafide businesses or other entities that have created blockchain solutions. These have tokens that are used for specific purposes on these blockchains, but they tend to make their way onto exchanges in hopes of quick riches. But these blockchain solutions also have a company behind them, possibly with stocks trading on a traditional exchange or over the counter. They'll have assets like equipment, people, and intellectual property that add value.\n\nInvesting in these companies may have better results in the long run if they have a blockchain product or service that is truly useful. For example, the banana farm in Loas funded by a cryptocurrency sale, with coins redeemable in Loatian bananas? Not so useful. A blockchain with a native token designed to increase traditional finance transaction times, cross-border payments, and stability? Possibly useful.\n\nA cryptocurrency issued for the sake of being a cryptocurrency and hoping for a return is genuinely worthless.\n\nStubborn Stances\n\nIn many cases, the forecast may come from an \"analyst\" with a \"permabull\" stance. These forecasters may turn out to be right\u2014anyone can plot a trend line on a graph and make a prediction. Eventually, someone will be right, and they'll be touted as the latest expert to listen to. You've likely seen a headline like \"Analyst that predicted a price of XYZ and was right, now forecasts ABC!\"\u2014and some will listen.\n\nSome might take an opposing stance, predicting that the markets will fall to a certain price. There is a chance that it will happen, and that person will be lauded as the one who knows\u2014and again, some will listen.\n\nSome analysts use the broken clock method\u2014even a broken clock is right twice a day\u2014to make predictions. At some point, they will be right.\n\nSpeculation\n\nIt's true that a significant number of cryptocurrency millionaires are out there who made lots of money from early investments in the space. But this was pure speculation at that point. Even though prices are continually rising over time, like the stock market, Bitcoin and many cryptocurrencies remain speculative to this day because they are driven by emotion and desire.\n\nMedia and News\n\nLike analysts, many media outlets want to be the ones that \"were there\" in the trenches with the traders and investors. Being the first to report is a big deal, so when there are whispers or speculation about a development, it is quickly disseminated to the masses. Case in point\u2014in October 2023, an employee at an outlet accidentally published a social media post about a Bitcoin Spot ETF, something many investors, brokerages, and financial management firms have been clamoring for. Bitcoin's price spiked more than $2,000 over several hours before dropping when fans realized it wasn't true, and the outlet released an apology.\n\nTradingView\n\nThis is a prime example of what happens in speculative investments. Investors (in reality, those who buy and hold bitcoin are speculators) succumb to the fear of missing out (FOMO) on an opportunity for large and quick profits.\n\nTrading\n\nCritical to prices is volume, and bitcoins are traded at an average of $24 billion per day. Trading activity is guided by price speculation on the part of traders\u2014people using bitcoins in transactions generally don't create any influence on prices because there isn't enough buying volume or enough payments being made to affect demand and supply. So, realistically, analysts use price data influenced by traders and investors to create predictions.\n\nWhat Will $100 of Bitcoin Be Worth in 2030? It is difficult to tell how much 1 BTC will be worth because its price varies so often and wildly. Between 2017 and 2023, its average price has slowly trended upward amidst large swings in both directions. So, it might go up or down\u2014if it is even still around.\n\nHow Much Is Bitcoin Worth in US Dollars? On Nov. 10, 2023, 1 BTC was worth $37,311.86, up nearly $21,000 from January 2023.\n\nHow Much Did Bitcoin Cost in 2010? In 2010, 1 BTC was worth between $0.1 and $0.2.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTaking a step away from issues with forecasters themselves, a cryptocurrency investor should always keep in mind that the cryptocurrency industry itself is inherently challenging to analyze. Even the developers of the top digital currencies in the world have a difficult time keeping tabs on all of the latest coins, tokens, companies, and developments.\n\nAnd, even assuming that one person could manage to successfully filter out the useful information in an ever-growing pipeline related to the digital currency space, the fact that the industry is so young and largely untested means that there is little by way of prior proven models, theories and strategies in place to help assess where things have been and where they're going.\n\nEven when a price prediction makes use of analysis in a sophisticated and appropriate way, there are always going to be many factors that the cryptocurrency community simply does not know about yet. This can, of course, be said for investing in general, but it is arguably even more of a concern in the nascent digital currency space. All of this is to say that investors in virtual currencies should keep a healthy dose of skepticism when news of the latest price prediction becomes available.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

That increasingly-dominant group of Big Tech stocks is up 95% year-to-date, by Insider's calculations.\n\nThose gains have come after a nightmarish 2022 for the entire digital-asset space. As well as the failure of FTX, crypto prices were rocked by the collapse of other big firms including stablecoin issuer Terra, lender Celsius Network, and the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.\n\nETF expectations\n\nSteadily growing speculation about the Securities and Exchange Commission potentially approving a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund has powered bitcoin's comeback.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts estimated there was a 90% chance that such a vehicle \u2013 which would allow big US-based institutional investors to buy crypto \u2013 would be approved before January 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile dozens of big-name firms have filed spot ETF applications with the SEC, perhaps the highest-profile has been BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with more than $9 trillion under management.\n\nBitcoin has jumped over 40% since BlackRock applied to have its ETF approved on June 15. CEO Larry Fink has said he believes a successful spot fund would help \"democratize crypto\" and make it cheaper to trade the token.\n\nAnother factor driving bitcoin's comeback is low supply available on the market, with long-term investors holding onto their stashes as they wait for prices to climb higher. The amount of bitcoin in circulation is currently extremely low, according to data from Glassnode.\n\nBullish predictions\n\nTraders are also gearing up for a so-called \"halving\" event that's expected to happen mid-2024. Industry veterans believe that event \u2013 when the number of bitcoins awarded to miners is cut in half \u2013 could push prices beyond $100,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it's not just crypto bulls getting excited about bitcoin's rally.\n\nSome big banks have started to issue headline-grabbing price predictions once again in recent months, after shrugging off the token's rally for much of this year.\n\nIn July, UK-based lender Standard Chartered predicted that bitcoin would surge to $120,000 next year with miners likely to cling onto their holdings, while last week Bernstein shared a $150,000 price target.\n\n\"You may not like bitcoin as much as we do, but a dispassionate view of bitcoin as a commodity suggests a turn of the cycle,\" Bernstein managing director Gautam Chhugani said in a report. \"A good idea is only as good as its timing.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FTX fiasco took its latest sorry turn earlier this month when Bankman-Fried was found guilty of seven counts of fraud \u2013 which could land the exchange's founder up to 110 years in prison.\n\nBut rather than falling from grace alongside the disgraced former billionaire, bitcoin's price has steadily risen \u2013 in a sign that even one of the biggest financial frauds in US history hasn't killed crypto."

The crypto has gained roughly 122% this year and 134% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe rally follows months of start-stop momentum surrounding the Securities and Exchange Commission's talks with financial firms over the potential approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. Late Wednesday, reports emerged that the regulator had opened fresh talks on the matter with Grayscale, a digital asset company that recently secured a legal victory against the SEC in its attempt to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.\n\nStrategists at Bloomberg Intelligence forecasted a 90% chance of approval for a spot ETF in the US by January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcitement over a spot ETF has been building all year, and applicants from fund management giants like BlackRock are waiting in the queue for approval by the SEC.\n\nMeanwhile, CoinDesk reported Thursday that a four-hour period in early Asian trading hours showed short-sellers liquidating nearly $50 million in bitcoin positions, sparking a \"short squeeze\" that helped the day's rally gain steam.\n\nAlso helping to drive the price higher is a low supply of bitcoin currently on the market. The supply of bitcoin in circulation is extremely low, according to Glassnode, with long-term investors holding onto their stash as the wait for prices to rise further. One figure suggests the amount of held bitcoin in wallets with minimal spending history recently hit a record of over 15.4 million.\n\nFurther out on the horizon, bitcoin's so-called \"halving\" event is expected to occur sometime in the middle 2024, which some industry veterans have said could eventually push the token's price above $100,000. \"Halving\" in crypto happens when the number of bitcoins rewarded to miners is cut in half.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach of the prior three halvings were followed by new all-time highs within 12 months."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged past $37,000 early Thursday, its highest level in 18 months. The cryptocurrency's gains come amid speculation that the SEC may finally approve a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nYahoo Finance Senior Reporter Jared Blikre analyzes the factors behind bitcoin's rise, observing patterns in other cryptocurrencies as the digital asset market aims to stage a recovery from recent crashes.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nSEANA SMITH: Well, Bitcoin is climbing higher today, hitting its highest level that we've seen in about 18 months, sitting just shy of 37,000 on renewed hopes of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre standing by on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the latest. Jared.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Yes, 37,000, really impressive. Let's go to the Wi-Fi interactive and talk about this Grayscale Bitcoin, which is about to become an ETF. The SEC lost that court case and there are a bunch of other spot ETFs-- spot Bitcoin ETFs that are just waiting to come into the market from BlackRock and a bunch of different ETF providers. So lots of hype surrounding that.\n\nAnd if we take a look at the chart, you can see 37,500 and change here. We have really accelerated off of this base here. So not much was happening for a few months. And then, suddenly, we got what some people are calling a God candle that would be right here. And now, we're clearing resistance. 35,000 was a big number. Now we're up to 37,000.\n\nLet me just show you a three-year chart so we can see where some of the price memory is. We're really in the thick of it right now at the lower end down here. But you can see tons of price memory all the way up to about 65,000-70,000. So the short story is there's a long way to go.\n\nBut, if Bitcoin is emerging finally from this crypto winter then there's lots of enthusiasm behind it, and perhaps we can clear a lot of these major hurdles. It was only yesterday, I was talking about the FTC's, perhaps, rising from the ashes, there are a number of potential suitors there. Three of which are leading the negotiations. One of which is headed by Tom Farley, who used to be the President of the New York Stock Exchange right here.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut back to the Wi-Fi interactive. Let me just show you what's happened over the last three days so you can really appreciate some of the outsized move that we've seen from some of the smaller tokens. FTT token. That's up 75%.\n\nLet me show you a one year chart. And it kind of looks like a sinusoidal pattern here. Periodic bouts of enthusiasm. I guess not worried that it's going to go to zero at least. We've seen this play out over the last year.\n\nBut if I put a three-year chart, you can really see the damage that was done to this token. It's basically down over 90% over the last two years. There you go, 96%-97%. All told here. It's looking good for the risk market it's not just Bitcoin and crypto, which is being seeing a lot of love.\n\nLet me go to some of our leading markets. If we go over the last three days. Actually, let me pull it up for the last seven that's going to take us back to, I believe, last Wednesday's Fed announcement, which really started the risk engine juice. ARK Invest is up 17.6%.\n\nCannabis up 12%. Gambling up 10%. So this is really all about risk on. And Crypto is just kind of participating, although, it admittedly does have its own fundamentals here, guys."

        "title": "Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin Were Up Today - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The crypto industry is once again moving higher, and three of the biggest cryptocurrencies are leading the way. As of 2 p.m. ET Friday, Bitcoin (BTC -4.07%) was up by 3% from where it traded when the stock market closed Thursday, Ethereum (ETH -3.87%) was up 4%, and Dogecoin (DOGE 0.69%) was up 5.3%.\n\nCryptocurrencies have been volatile over the past year, but have been charging higher since mid-October.\n\nBehind the rise in cryptocurrencies\n\nThe biggest news out relating to crypto Friday is that BlackRock (BLK -1.99%) is pursuing an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), just as it has been trying to get permission to launch a Bitcoin ETF. There are already ways for investors to buy crypto on traditional exchanges, but they're not as efficient as ETFs, which is why BlackRock and others are trying to get ETFs approved.\n\nIn theory, more options for investing in crypto will lead to more money pouring into tokens, which will drive prices higher. That's why traders are getting out in front of any ETF approvals, and they could bid values higher.\n\nRight now, the barrier preventing such ETFs from reaching the market is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has neither approved crypto ETFs nor laid out rules around cryptocurrencies in general. That has left the industry in limbo, and Congress has yet to agree on a regulatory framework for crypto either. Based on BlackRock's involvement, many investors speculate that ETFs could be the one way to make crypto more mainstream as the SEC and Congress wait to act.\n\nThe interesting thing is, it's not just Bitcoin and Ethereum that are moving higher on the speculation about Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs -- all of the major cryptocurrencies are moving higher as investors expect there will eventually be a flood of crypto ETF products.\n\nGrowth on the blockchain\n\nDespite the drop in crypto prices over the last couple of years, the industry continues to develop, and businesses and developers are creating more meaningful projects on blockchains. Visa is testing using blockchains to complete payments, and so are Shopify and MercadoLibre. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of other projects underway at companies around the world.\n\nThis is the kind of activity that's going to drive value to cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, but investors are currently just speculating about possible future value creation. I tend to think there will be value, but the moves recently aren't necessarily indicative of long-term value.\n\nWhat I would watch for is where developers are building on the blockchain. It's not Bitcoin or Dogecoin that are getting activity -- it's blockchains like Ethereum and Solana that are built for utility and more activity that will ultimately benefit.\n\nI would also expect to see the jump in value subside even if ETFs are approved, based on the \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" pattern. That's why I'm not jumping in on the crypto bounce right now. But I will hold on for the ride as this industry matures."

Short squeezes occur when the price of an asset jumps higher than expected and short sellers are forced to cover their positions, driving the price higher still. Exchanges with a large Asian presence such as BitMEX, OKX and Binance accounted for large chunks of the exited positions. Bitcoin's bullish momentum followed reports late Wednesday that the U.S. SEC is beginning talks with fund manager Grayscale, with whom it has been engaged in a legal fight over the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF."

        "content": "The cryptocurrency rally, which had abruptly stalled over the past couple of months, has regained momentum this month, with Bitcoin (BTC) trading above $36,600 on Nov 8. The rally comes amid a spate of developments and soaring optimism around the overall crypto market.\n\nThe bullish trend is expected to continue in the last two months of the year as well. The cryptocurrency market staged a solid turnaround in the first seven months of the year after a disappointing 2022.\n\nHowever, the rally stalled in early August, and prices have been rangebound since then. The fresh rally comes on the heels of some positive news and upbeat investor sentiment following the Fed\u2019s decision to keep interest rates unchanged in the range of 5.25-5.5% in its September and November FOMC meetings back-to-back.\n\nAlthough the Fed said that inflation is still way above its 2% target, which has kept it open for another 25-basis-point interest rate hike this year, fresh jobs data hinted at a cooling labor market.\n\nThis has raised expectations that the Federal Reserve may be done with its monetary tightening campaign.\n\nHigher interest rates typically have a negative impact on growth sectors such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrency. Hence, the Federal Reserve's decision to pause rate hikes bodes well for the cryptocurrency space.\n\nThis was all major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) rebounding this month.\n\nAnother factor behind the rally is soaring expectations among investors that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is just on the anvil of approving a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe expected approval by the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF is likely to boost demand, allowing conventional investors to access Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through regular stock markets.\n\nAdditionally, it's expected to attract new investments into the crypto industry, potentially resulting in heightened demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin has now more than doubled this year, and the rally is expected to continue.

Indeed, Bitcoin's pseudonymous inventor likely knew this creation was novel and innovative, but who could have imagined that it would usher in a new era of finance?\n\nAs its 15th birthday passes, it's time to take a closer look at why Bitcoin has taken the world by storm, how it has evolved, and where it could be headed.\n\nStarting the crypto movement\n\nThere are thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation today, but it's important to remember that without Bitcoin, most of them wouldn't exist. Bitcoin's creation and open-source code provided developers with a blueprint and starting point to create new cryptocurrencies. Although the cryptocurrency asset class has grown from one to many thousands, Nakamoto's creation remains the clear leader, not only in price but also in technology.\n\nAlthough newer cryptocurrencies often tout features that provide greater scalability or revamped security models, Nakamoto's elegant yet simple design has proven to be the most robust, resilient, and capable blockchain. Boasting a track record of zero hacks and the highest levels of decentralization, Bitcoin remains the quintessential cryptocurrency in a class of its own.\n\nBitcoin's historical evolution\n\nNakamoto created Bitcoin for various reasons in response to the Great Recession. One of the primary motivations mentioned in the white paper was to establish a decentralized payment system that does not require intermediaries, such as banks. While initially designed for transactions and still technically able to be used in this fashion, Bitcoin has evolved to become a preferred option for storing wealth in a decentralized system. Unlike fiat currencies that are subject to devaluation, Bitcoin provides another way to store wealth. Thanks to Bitcoin's sound monetary policy and finite supply, Nakamoto's creation has become a viable means for holders to preserve value.\n\nNot only have Bitcoin's use cases evolved with time, but so has the code itself. While Nakamoto would still recognize the original Bitcoin, there have been a series of upgrades known as Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) implemented over the past decade and a half that have enhanced Bitcoin's functionality. Two of the most popular BIPs have been dubbed SegWit and Taproot.\n\nWith the release of SegWit in 2017, Bitcoin transactions became faster and cheaper by changing how data is stored. Building off of SegWit, the Taproot upgrade was approved in 2021 to enhance privacy and smart contract capabilities by making all transactions appear uniform on the blockchain, a long sought-after feature. Best of all, even after all the improvements, Bitcoin still retains its fundamental features of decentralization and security, all while becoming more capable and efficient.\n\nLooking ahead: Bitcoin's ongoing journey\n\nIt has been a long and historic journey for Bitcoin -- and yet it is likely only beginning. What was once an obscure cryptocurrency used by tech enthusiasts has gone from processing just a few hundred daily transactions to more than 700,000. This extraordinary rise in adoption is now garnering attention from Wall Street juggernauts like BlackRock and Fidelity as they vie for approval for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Not to mention, countries like El Salvador have embraced Nakamoto's creation as an official form of currency.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is breaking through barriers in traditional finance, developments are occurring on a new frontier that could increase Bitcoin's prominence. In May 2023, Bitcoin got another new use case with the introduction of Ordinals. As a way for users to essentially mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Ordinals signify the growing interest in Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi). With the current DeFi economy worth more than $43 billion today, Bitcoin has been unable to participate in this burgeoning market due to limitations in its code. But with Ordinals and other technological developments such as Layer-2 blockchains like Stacks, the likelihood of Bitcoin entering DeFi is increasingly likely and could unleash pent-up capital in novel ways.\n\nSupply, demand, and Bitcoin's ascent\n\nAs more individuals, institutions, and even countries adopt Bitcoin, the demand for its limited supply of 21 million coins is intensifying. This trend makes it difficult to predict an exact target price for Bitcoin. However, one thing is clear -- the simple supply and demand dynamics suggest that the value of Bitcoin will rise.\n\nRather than speculating on Bitcoin's exact price target, it is best to focus on its significance, which may well be greater than any projection. With each passing day, Bitcoin is proving its resiliency, discovering new use cases, and filling gaps in the financial system. Therefore, the next 15 years could be even more revolutionary for Bitcoin than the first 15, as Nakamoto's invention paves the way for a new era of financial innovation."

        "content": "Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz has told investors that 2024 will be headlined by institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, which will be driven by the pending approval of Bitcoin (BTC) spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nDuring Galaxy Digital\u2019s third-quarter earnings call on Nov. 9, Novogratz highlighted the firm\u2019s belief that approving several ETFs \u201cis now not a matter of if but when.\u201d The fund manager filed its spot Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) ETF applications with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in partnership with Invesco in Q3 2023.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin briefly tops $37K amid market optimism for pending spot ETF approvals\n\nInvestors\u2019 sentiment has turned bullish in November 2023, with prominent ETF research analysts predicting the SEC will have approved 12 major Bitcoin spot ETF applications by January 2024.\n\n\u201c2024 literally is going to be a year of institutional adoption, primarily first through the Bitcoin ETF, which will be followed by an Ethereum ETF,\u201d Novogratz said during the Q3 earnings call.\n\n\u201cAs institutions get more comfortable, if the government gives its seal of approval that Bitcoin is a thing, you are going to see the rest of allocators starting to look at things outside of that. And so, money will flow into the space.\u201d\n\nNovogratz added that institutional investment could come to a head in 2025 as investments \u201cin tokenization and wallets\u201d ramp up. The Galaxy Digital CEO added that a key focus for the U.S. landscape should be ensuring that dollar-backed stablecoins remain a central cog in the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\n\u201cWe are going to continue to be dollar-dominant. We better have a dollar-backed stablecoin that reflects our values and is taken up around the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Novogratz, a Bitcoin ETF will bring a measure of institutional confidence and a significant amount of funding to the cryptocurrency space.\n\n\u201cThis ETF is giving us all breathing space, putting life in the system. That brings in capital that allows the rest of the stuff to flourish. But I think if you look at the crypto long-term plan, it\u2019s on target,\u201d he added.\n\nThe potential influence of an Ether spot ETF was also brought up during the investor call. Galaxy Digital\u2019s CEO said its possible approval might not be as well received as a Bitcoin ETF, given that Ethereum\u2019s validating model is based on a staking model and staking yields.\n\nRelated: CME overtakes Binance to grab largest share of Bitcoin futures open interest\n\n\u201cUnless they can figure out an ETF that actually passes through the staking rewards, it will be kind of a subpar product from just owning Ethereum with someone like us and having it staked,\u201d Novogratz explained.\n\nHe added that the technical difference would be significant if investors were looking at yields between 4% and 7%, depending on the method of staking. Utility remains an important factor, with Novogratz stressing that different blockchains and their native tokens need to \u201cserve a purpose\u201d and have \u201cstuff built on them\u201d to sustain long-term value.\n\nMagazine: Exclusive: 2 years after John McAfee\u2019s death, widow Janice is broke and needs answers"

In the past month, bitcoin has surged 32% as the SEC appears closer to approving the first bitcoin spot ETF in the US. Investing giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity are leading the efforts to establish such funds.\n\nBut while crypto-enthusiasts have touted the ETFs as a way to acquaint Wall Street's more traditional investors with bitcoin, JPMorgan analysts are unconvinced that this would inject fresh capital into the space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, the spot ETFs would attract investment from existing bitcoin products, such as Grayscale's bitcoin trust, future ETFs, and bitcoin mining companies, which tend to amass the token.\n\n\"We envisage this shift as a relative value trade as several of the above bitcoin products trade at a premium or much reduced discount relative to the past,\" the note said.\n\nAs for new investors, spot ETFs existing in other countries have failed to attract impressive interest, JPMorgan noted. The biggest physically-backed bitcoin fund, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, has been relatively flat since its launch in 2021.\n\nAnalysts also noted that SEC authorization for spot ETFs \u2014 which the agency first challenged in court \u2014 doesn't signal a complete regulatory reversal towards the crypto industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While this year's Ripple vs SEC and Grayscale vs SEC court rulings represent legal defeats for the SEC, it is far from clear that the regulatory tightening of the crypto industry will lessen significantly going forward given how unregulated this industry is,\" the note said. \"US crypto industry regulations are still pending and we do not believe US lawmakers would shift their stance because of the above two legal cases, especially with the memories from the FTX fraud still fresh.\"\n\nUnder Chairman Gary Gensler, the agency has taken a heavy-handed approach in supervising the sector, characterizing it as rife with \"fraud\" and \"hucksters.\"\n\nWhatever the outcome on Wall Street, crypto markets are also getting a boost from bitcoin's upcoming halving cycle in April. This predetermined event lowers the amount of tokens awarded to miners, putting pressure on future supply and inducing a further price rally.\n\nWhile this has historically happened at each halving, JPMorgan says that the halving price is already priced in at bitcoin's current level."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough crypto markets are rebounding in the face of promising developments like the approval of the first US spot bitcoin ETF, the sector continues to suffer the same fundamental defects, famed short-seller Jim Chanos said.\n\nIn a new interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking, the Chanos & Company founder laid out how the crypto sphere can be an avenue for financial fraud, challenges facing Tesla, and his views on the nascent artificial intelligence space.\n\nHere are the legendary short-seller's best quotes from the interview:\n\nCrypto and the dark side of finance\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You have to understand that the crypto ecosystem is well-suited for the dark side of finance for a lot of reasons. It's perfect for facilitating money laundering and illicit transactions. But also, there's the nature of the unregulated domiciles for a lot of this activity where someone can go to basically defraud customers, whether it's NFTs or ICOs or all the various types of digital flimflammery out there \u2013 it's perfect.\"\n\nBitcoin spot ETFs\n\nIn Chanos' view, recent efforts by investing giants to establish the first US bitcoin spot ETFs are another iteration of flimflammery, with the hope of profiting from crypto's high transaction fees.\n\n\"[Retail investors] think the asset price is going to go up. It's like a Nasdaq stock, not a currency. So they'll pay, and Wall Street wants the fees. The cost structure in crypto is quite high and so the fees are really high. You need retail investors because institutions aren't going to be paying 4% per round trip to buy and sell Bitcoin. Mom and Pop are, so Wall Street needs to keep the public interested in the crypto space.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla's biggest challenges\n\n\"When you look at the actual numbers, which is what we do, it's a car company. [Elon Musk's] margins are car company margins, his returns are car company returns. That's the dichotomy: the challenge of running a real global auto company vs. the hype of going to Mars or selling you a robot to do your household chores.\"\n\nChanos also noted that the recent United Auto Workers strike against Tesla competitors didn't benefit the EV-manufacturer, even though it afforded pay increases to union workers.\n\n\"It's interesting, if you actually look at employment cost per vehicle, the good news is that based on the latest UAW contract, the hourly salary or wages per Tesla employee is about half the UAW, but this is the paradox: He has many more employees per vehicle produced than the American companies do. The American companies are actually more automated than Tesla. So the labor cost per vehicle isn't much different.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe price of AI\n\n\"Growth in the 10 years prior to the advent of the internet, 1989-1999, was higher than in 1999-2009. While the internet created a lot of businesses and wealth, it also destroyed a lot \u2014 creative destruction. Businesses we took for granted are no longer with us because of the digitization of products. I suspect AI will be similar.\"\n\nChanos offered an example: \"When the AI hype got going in the spring, the IBM CEO said something to the effect of, well, we're looking at all of our employees to see if AI will make any of them redundant. I joked that they better hope their customers don't say the same thing. IBM is consulting! You have to think through all the iterations.\""

        "content": "Oversized crypto critic Nouriel Roubini\u2019s fix for crumbling US dollar hegemony is a cryptocurrency: Atlas, a portfolio safe haven from persistent inflation and fiery global conflict. One that will outperform the US dollar in perpetuity.\n\nBut for all of Atlas\u2019 pomp, Roubini\u2019s pitch can be boiled down to the following: We\u2019ve devised an AI-powered trading bot that will beat the dollar and accelerate green investments.\n\nWhat Atlas proposes is nothing new \u2014 similar projects were popular around the 2017-2018 ICO boom with none seeing long-term success. It\u2019s likely Atlas will be no different.\n\nFunnily enough, on the surface Atlas (full name the Atlas Capital Team Index, or ACT) actually sounds just like bitcoin (BTC), of which Roubini is a staunch skeptic. But in execution, ACT more resembles stablecoin Tether (USDT), which Roubini has previously labeled a massive fraud illicitly pumping crypto prices.\n\nRoubini\u2019s constant crypto negging makes his token project a soft target. But his conversion should hardly surprise: Tether says it\u2019s earning $700 million in profits every quarter due to ballooning yields on its $50-billion-plus stash of Treasurys backing USDT.\n\nWhat\u2019s more frustrating is the way in which Roubini, via Atlas, has adopted the worst habits of crypto marketing so readily.\n\nIn presentation, ACT reminds me of the worst initial coin offerings of cycles past: Inane techno-finance jibber-jabber addled with meaningless buzzwords.\n\nThe project\u2019s website lacks a formal whitepaper, or any real technical details (which blockchain will be used is still a mystery). Its \u201cexecutive summary\u201d is more a collection of lofty promises slotted between bullish charts all pointing to one thing: ACT tokens going up.\n\nRoubini, a grumpy economist who found mainstream fame when his incessant doomposting finally correlated with widespread market meltdown (the 2008 global financial crisis), became notorious in crypto for celebrating price corrections as if they were cataclysmic Black Swan events.\n\nLoading Tweet.. Bitcoin has negative value, according to Roubini\n\nCritics like Roubini often say BTC can never be \u201cdigital gold\u201d \u2014 a precious metal alternative for terminally online millennials \u2014 as it\u2019s not backed by anything physical. Gold can at least be smelted into jewelry, coins or toilets; something intrinsically valuable. Good luck doing that with BTC.\n\nRather, bitcoin is only valuable due to supply and demand \u2014 whether as an investment or a censorship-resistant cash network. Roubini seems certain that demand will dry up any day now, sending the whole industry to zero.\n\n\u201cBitcoin falls more than 40% from its peak in less than one month,\u201d Roubini posted in 2021, as BTC was retreating from record highs. \u201cWhich institutional investors are reckless enough to invest in such a risky and volatile pseudo-asset with no intrinsic value? They should be fired on the spot if undertaking such a reckless speculative gamble!\u201d\n\nRoubini now marketing his own special blend of tokenized speculation is surely ironic, but he probably wouldn\u2019t agree. Atlas, of which he is a co-founder and chief economist, would sell a token at least backed by a basket of real-world assets \u2014 mostly gold, US Treasurys, bonds from Gulf countries and exposure to real estate in regions marginally affected by the climate change Black Swan.\n\nInflation-hedging aside, Atlas\u2019 overall structure really does mirror USDT. Tether fractionalizes exposure to a carefully managed portfolio of real-world assets (like Treasurys and bonds), and sells that exposure to crypto users, one dollar token at a time.\n\nAtlas says it has back-tested its AI-powered strategy and found it \u201cprovided positive annual returns in 48 of the last 51 years, and has consistently outperformed 10-year treasuries, typical 60/40 portfolios, and repeatedly delivered greater returns vs the S&P 500.\u201d\n\nAtlas will also sell tokenized fractional exposure to its own basket of assets, But rather than the US dollar, ACT tokens track an ETF tied to an index of Atlas assets. And Atlas purportedly tweaks its index so masterfully (with the help of machine learning and AI) that it easily outruns inflation and \u201cpreserves the purchasing power of financially vulnerable members of Emerging Market economies.\u201d\n\nAtlas says it \u201cuses machine learning and artificial intelligence to track and measure price performance and volatility of the underlying assets used in Atlas investment products.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsing this underlying technology, Atlas can select and allocate assets to offer optimal inflation-protected returns. The proprietary asset management algorithm analyzes market signals and macro data in a systematic and impartial manner to construct resilient portfolios of sovereign bonds, commodities, and REITs that maximize risk-weighted returns.\u201d\n\nSo, where Tether helps those in economies wrought by currency devaluation preserve their wealth by jumping into a dollar-pegged token, Roubini\u2019s Atlas wants to go one step further by breaking them free from the greenback once and for all.\n\n(For what it\u2019s worth, crypto thought leaders including Coinbase\u2019s Brian Armstrong and Balaji Srinivasan have previously opined about the potential for so-called \u201cflatcoins\u201d \u2014 stablecoins pegged to inflation rather than the US dollar \u2014 to one day disrupt USD-linked tokens in much the same way.)\n\nIf only those ravaged by inflation in Turkey or Argentina had bought fractionalized exposure to Roubini\u2019s LLM\n\nHang around crypto fans long enough and Gandhi will appear. \u201cFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.\u201d If crypto mass adoption were scaled to that quote, Roubini\u2019s participation in Atlas signals victory.\n\nAlthough at this rate, it\u2019s sadly just another opportunity for them to laugh.\n\nDavid is an Editor based in the Netherlands focused on data-driven journalism.

If you're going to keep up with the Magnificent Seven you're going to have to grow your revenues and cash flows at 20% a year or faster ad infinitum,\" Saylor said in a Fox Business interview earlier this week. \"There's seven companies that generate all the shareholder returns. There's 7,000 companies that can't keep up. What we did in August of 2020 was recognize that there's no way we're going to outgrow Google and Microsoft and Apple Computer as a mid-sized software company.\"\n\nSaylor explained that his company began to seek out a \"high-growth digital monopoly\" to invest in, and decided bitcoin was the most promising asset.\n\n\"We realized bitcoin is like a high-tech dominant digital network growing at 40% or 50% a year, and so we bought it,\" he said. \"It's kept growing at 40% to 50% a year, and now we're using our balance sheet to grow the company.\"\n\nBitcoin has rallied sharply in 2023 but can push even higher once regulators approve financial firms' bitcoin spot ETF products, in Saylor's view. Bloomberg Intelligence strategists forecast a 90% chance of approval by January 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"[Bitcoin's] supply and demand are in balance right now, but after the halving in April, the supply gets cut in half,\" Saylor maintained. \"And after the spot ETFs come online, the demand's going to at least double. So the only thing that's going to adjust there is the price in order to get the market to clear.\"\n\nOther players in the digital asset sector have predicted that bitcoin could soar beyond $100,000 as a result of the halving. Each of the prior three halving events for bitcoin were followed by new record-highs in the subsequent 12 months.\n\n\"The next 12 months are pretty auspicious for the asset class,\" Saylor said."

        "content": "Bitcoin Group SE (ETR:ADE) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 11% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last three years have been less than pleasing. In fact, the share price is down 21% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return.\n\nNow let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Bitcoin Group\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nBitcoin Group saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 16% per year, over the last three years. In comparison the 8% compound annual share price decline isn't as bad as the EPS drop-off. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have previously priced some of the drop in. With a P/E ratio of 65.60, it's fair to say the market sees a brighter future for the business.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nWe know that Bitcoin Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Bitcoin Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 9.1% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 3% per year over the last half decade. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Bitcoin Group has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on German exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

The timing of it overtaking Binance, a crypto-focused exchange, is poignant. Wall Street firms like BlackRock are increasingly steering the narrative around bitcoin and the rest of crypto, by trying, for instance, to introduce bitcoin and ether (ETH) ETFs in an attempt to open up crypto investing to a broader group of people. Such financial heavyweights are accustomed to doing business on a highly regulated exchange like CME, as opposed to Binance, which has run into trouble with U.S. regulators."

        "title": "3 theses that will drive Ethereum and Bitcoin in the next bull market - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "After 2021, we entered an era in cryptocurrency where people stopped talking only about financial decentralization and started to broadly discuss the tokenization of everything, thanks in part to nonfungible tokens (NFTs).\n\nThis shift represents a critical perspective that is set to guide three theses for the upcoming bull market. To fully grasp these theses, it is crucial to understand that everything is data. Money is data. Your engagement with a brand is data. Your credentials are data. The ticket for your favorite show is data.\n\nSince 2021, the ecosystem has increasingly started to store a large part of this data in the form of fungible tokens, NFTs, and timestamps on the blockchain, which acts as a data repository in this context.\n\nRelated: Expect new IRS crypto surveillance to come with a surge in confiscation\n\nWhile not all data needs to be on the blockchain, the ability to place data on the blockchain radically transforms how we store, share, and utilize data for automated and secure instructions and transactions.\n\nAnd it seems that this prospect of tokenizing everything is coming to Bitcoin. This gives rise to the first thesis.\n\nOrdinals and similar protocols continue to grow, while Bitcoin becomes a network for multi-assets (or multiple data types)\n\nIn January 2023, Casey Rodamor publicly released the Ordinals protocol, which, in short, allows for the permanent insertion of any file type into the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIn less than a year, the community has already conducted experiments in which music, artwork, journalistic articles, and even video games are being inscribed on the world's leading blockchain.\n\nThe Ordinals protocol was not the first to allow this, but it has gained the most traction. And everything indicates that this is a flame that will not go out.\n\nMore than just a technical protocol, a culture and a mindset have been created where more and more builders see Bitcoin as a canvas for the creation of other projects and applications, and nothing can stop well-established cultural movements.\n\nBut remember: not everything needs to be stored 100% on-chain, as this is expensive and, for some applications, inefficient.\n\nTherefore, protocols such as Taproot Assets \u2014 which enable the creation of other assets \u2014 on the Bitcoin network but in a way that keeps most of the information off-chain, will be essential.\n\nSpeaking of storage costs on layer-1 blockchains, it looks like layer-2 blockchains are set to shine.\n\nCrypto will break out of its bubble and finally reach the everyday person through layer-2 blockchains\n\nThose who were active during the 2021 bull market recall that $50 for a transaction fee on Ethereum was almost the norm, not to mention the spikes, like during the minting of the Otherside NFTs by Yuga Labs, where users paid up to six Ether (ETH) per transaction.\n\nIt's simple: if the blockchain isn't invisible, it won't reach the mainstream. And expensive and slow transactions make the blockchain highly noticeable.\n\nThat's why layer-2 blockchains \u2014 designed to scale layer-1 blockchains \u2014 will be so crucial for the next bull market.\n\nAlthough they've been around for years, neither they nor the market was mature enough to build on them in the last cycle. On one hand, many companies and developers weren't convinced that layer-2s were stable enough to handle a significant influx from the mainstream. On the other hand, there was also the issue that, in the excitement of the moment, people acted without studying and understanding much.\n\nThe number of projects unnecessarily on Ethereum was significant, and the reasons varied: it was cultural, because some companies didn't even know what secondary layers were, or simply because everyone was building on Ethereum.\n\nNow, with all the lessons learned and the calm that has settled in with the bear market, it's clear that the mentality for building is much more mature, and the 'jobs to be done' by blockchains have become much clearer to those who are building.\n\nAnd the cherry on top will be the implementation of EIP-4844, which is expected to happen in a few months on the Ethereum network, and will further reduce the transaction costs of layer-2 networks, making them even more invisible and robust to attract and retain the mainstream audience.\n\nComparison of gas fees before and after EIP-4844. Source: IntoTheBlock\n\nBut it's useless for the infrastructure to be invisible if people can't connect to it and companies can't build on it. However, the solution is already here!\n\nAbstraction solutions will be the main gateway and retention mechanism for users and large traditional companies on Web3\n\nThe big issue is that with the tokenization of everything, in some cases decentralization is more of a hindrance than a help.\n\nIf the topic is Bitcoin (BTC) custody, the topic of decentralization is pertinent. However, when the subject shifts to tokenized tickets or a company's loyalty credentials, the value does not lie in the system's decentralization. Therefore, simplifying the user's experience by abstracting complex processes \u2014 such as creating a semi-custodial wallet with social login or eliminating concerns about gas fees \u2014 makes total sense and it's necessary.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin beyond 35K for Christmas? Thank Jerome Powell if it happens\n\nAbstraction solutions were the missing bridge so that the crypto universe does not continue to be a technical environment exclusive to technically skilled people willing to face various challenges and complex journeys. But now, they are ready to shine!\n\nAnd It's not about ending decentralization, it's about having an option. Those who want to remain 100% decentralized can do so, but those who don't now have an option. This way, it avoids the crypto ecosystem dying in the famous chasm of innovation. Because magnificent infrastructures are pointless if people cannot connect to and navigate them easily in everyday life.\n\nThe Technology Adoption Life Cycle highlighting the chasm between early adopters and the mainstream market. Source: \"Crossing The Chasm\" by Geoffrey A. Moore\n\nSomething that's not often discussed is how important these abstraction solutions are for traditional companies to effectively join Web3 too. How many companies currently have a team of developers who can program in blockchain languages, like Solidity? Making it easier for builders to get started is also crucial.\n\nBreaking down the blockchain journey to mainstream into four phases, we could say that the account abstraction solutions, along with the advancements mentioned in thesis two, will propel Web3 into its penultimate phase \u2014 with improved infrastructure, fewer technical builders and brands join the game, and the number of applications, projects, and use cases multiply, attracting mainstream attention.\n\nAs of today, it seems that major blockchains will be increasingly viewed as platforms for multi-asset consensus in the next market cycle and less as currencies. The crowning gem will be the quest for scalability, which will make the layers more invisible and less complex for users to navigate and for businesses to integrate.

Source: James Seyffart\n\nWhile the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is in no way guaranteed, both Seyffart and Balchunas predict a 90% chance of an approval sometime before Jan. 10 next year.\n\nGrayscale in talks with SEC over GBTC conversion\n\nWhile market pundits eagerly await the SEC\u2019s decision, crypto asset manager Grayscale has reportedly initiated discussions with the regulator concerning its application to convert its trust product GBTC into a spot Bitcoin ETF, according to a Nov. 9 report from CoinDesk.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, Grayscale has been in contact with both the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets and the Division of Corporation Finance since winning its court battle with the regulator on Aug. 29.\n\nAs the perceived odds of a Bitcoin ETF being approved have increased, so too has optimism in the crypto market, with the price of Bitcoin gaining more than 30% in the last 3 months. Bitcoin\u2019s outsized rally has buoyed price activity in other major assets as well.\n\nRelated: Spot Bitcoin ETF hype reignited zest for blockchain games: Yat Siu\n\nIn the past month, Solana (SOL) gained a staggering 93% amid scaling improvements, while Ripple (XRP) and Ether (ETH) grew 36% and 20% respectively.\n\nWhile many within the industry are confident an approval will kickstart the next bull market, other analysts aren\u2019t convinced that the rally has staying power.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market \u2014 Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

        "content": "China to protect NFTs\n\nIn a surprise move, the Chinese government has guaranteed legal protection for NFTs.\n\nIn response to a series of often conflicting judicial opinions on the state of cryptocurrency in the country, the Chinese government has officially issued a legal commentary on dealing with cases of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) theft and their status as virtual property protected by law.\n\nAccording to a Nov. 9 publication by China\u2019s state-controlled Southwest University of Political Science and Law (SUPL), digital collectibles such as NFTs \u2014 unlike ordinary online images \u2014 conform to the characteristics of online virtual property due to their non-tamperable features, unique codes and detailed transaction information.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis highlights the scarcity of digital collections, which have both use value and exchange value,\u201d jurists write. \u201cAccording to Article 127 of the Civil Code, it can be seen that from the perspective of civil law, online virtual property is regarded as an object of rights that \u2018is different from property rights, creditor\u2019s rights, intellectual property rights, etc. and is protected by civil law\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn addition, jurists state that the theft of NFTs, therefore, carries applicable criminal penalties, which can be evaluated in conjunction with related offenses committed during the course of the theft, such as hacking into computer systems or data theft.\n\n\n\n\u201cDigital collections have technical characteristics that cannot be copied, indicating that the holder has exclusive control. If the digital collection is stolen by others, the holder loses exclusive control,\u201d jurists from SUPL say.\n\n\u201cAlthough our country has not yet opened the secondary circulation market for NFTs, consumers can rely on the trading platform to complete operations such as purchase, collection, transfer, and destruction, and achieve exclusive possession, use, and disposal rights.\u201d\n\nChina has seen a rise in civil disputes this year involving cryptocurrencies, with some courts ruling that virtual assets are protected by law and others saying they are not. Last month, Chinese government-owned newspaper China Daily announced a 2.813 million Chinese yuan ($390,000) grant for third-party contractors to design an NFT platform. In May, Chinese prosecutors announced they would crack down on \u201cpseudo-innovations\u201d within its NFT market.\n\nA Chinese judge explains that according to current laws, parties in a crypto lending contract are not entitled to judicial protection.\n\nBitget\u2019s to invest in India\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Bitget will invest $10 million over five years in startups primarily based in India.\n\nAccording to the Nov. 7 announcement, startups will have the opportunity to pitch to Bitget and venture capitalists including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, and Draper Labs, during the BUIDL for Web3 multichain summit in India.\n\n\n\n\u201cBitget aims to identify valuable and promising projects in the crypto space and provide them with comprehensive support, accelerating innovation in emerging technologies,\u201d the exchange says. To qualify, projects must have a minimum viable product and hold multiple layers of security functionalities with auditing transparency.\n\nGracy Chen, Bitget\u2019s managing director, says that India is \u201cthe most wanted place to invest in Asia,\u201d citing its constant advancements in blockchain and overall entrepreneurial spirit. The exchange\u2019s previous investments in Indian Web3 startups include AI-based script generator Grease Pencil, AI resume generator HAIr, and AI dermatological app Derma360.\n\nLinekong\u2019s $15M Bitcoin Fund\n\nLinekong Interactive, a Chinese tech firm listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HKEX), will kickstart a $15 million fund dedicated to revitalizing the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem.\n\nAccording to founder Wang Feng, the new fund is dubbed \u201cBTC Next\u201d and will accelerate novel projects developing asset issuance, exchanges, virtual machines, NFTs and GameFi protocols on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n\n\n\u201cBTC NEXT will participate in the research and investment of Bitcoin network ecological assets as early as possible, publish crypto investment portfolios regularly, and update the list of Bitcoin ecological crypto assets participating in investment,\u201d Wang writes.\n\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem has expanded greatly this year with the invention of Ordinals and Inscriptions, two novel data storage methods that, together, allow users to mint unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. The market cap of Bitcoin tokens minted on the BRC-20 standard, mirrored after the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, has surpassed $1.4 billion since inception.\n\nLinekong was founded in Beijing in 2007 with a focus on video games and cinema. In 2018, Wang Feng resigned as CEO of Linekong to focus on blockchain, founding several projects in the nonfungible tokens, decentralized finance, and Bitcoin mining space. He returned to Linekong as CEO in 2022 after an invitation from the firm\u2019s board of directors to better integrate Linekong products with Web3.\n\nThe Ordinals timeline. (Originals Bot)\n\nSEBA Bank approved in Hong Kong\n\nSwiss fintech SEBA Bank has received a license from Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\n\nThe license permits SEBA Bank to conduct regulated activities in Hong Kong and distribute virtual asset-backed securities, advise on crypto assets, and manage crypto investment accounts on behalf of clients. It also permits SEBA Bank to distribute, manage, and advise on traditional securities, such as stocks.\n\n\u201cHong Kong has been at the center of the crypto economy since Bitcoin\u2019s inception, and we are very pleased to have added this Hong Kong license with the full approval from the SFC to our existing licenses in Switzerland (FINMA) and Abu Dhabi (FSRA),\u201d comments SEBA Bank CEO Franz Bergmueller. Meanwhile, Amy Yu, the firm\u2019s Asia-Pacific CEO, praised the SFC for creating a \u201cfacilitative\u201d environment during the licensing process.\n\nCointelegraph previously reported that SEBA Bank launched institutional Ethereum staking services in September.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nA bot that\u2019s designed to stifle the creation of new BRC-20s re-emerged on the Bitcoin blockchain. Its pseudonymous creator, @rot13maxi on Twitter, told Decrypt that he didn\u2019t do it. But he did share the code with someone else yesterday.\n\nDubbed the Sophon, the bot looks for incoming Bitcoin transactions that involve Ordinals and \u201csnipes\u201d certain ones before they can become fully processed. Paying a fee to effectively jump the line in Bitcoin\u2019s queue, the bot foils fresh BRC-20s by frontrunning their ticker names.\n\n\u201cI think that there is a copy of the Sophon out there running, and it's not me, which is great,\u201d @rot13maxi said, adding that he is \u201cgoing back and forth\u201d on sharing the bot\u2019s code publicly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLaunched earlier this year, Ordinals is a protocol that allows for the creation of NFT-like assets on Bitcoin by \u201cinscribing\u201d it onto individual satoshis, which are equal to 1/100,000,000 of a whole Bitcoin. That data has so far included art, profile pictures, and text.\n\nPioneered by the pseudonymous on-chain data analyst Domo in March, BRC-20s are fungible tokens on Bitcoin realized through Ordinals.\n\nBRC-20s are created using text-based inscriptions, which comprise JSON code. \u200b\u200bAmid surging interest in BRC-20 tokens in May, Bitcoin transaction fees skyrocketed to multi-year highs as hundreds of thousands of text-based Ordinals inscriptions flooded Bitcoin\u2019s mempool daily.\n\nShort for memory pool, Bitcoin\u2019s mempool is a backlog of transactions waiting to be verified by miners and added to the Bitcoin network's next block. In addition to Bitcoin\u2019s block rewards, miners receive transaction fees tied to each transaction. If a user inputs a higher fee, miners are incentivized to act quickly.\n\nHow the Sophon Works\n\nThe Sophon snuffs out new BRC-20s using this mechanic, @rot13maxi said. For a BRC-20 to exist, it needs to be deployed first using a text-based inscription. The bot seeks out these transactions, copies the token\u2019s ticker name, and stops a BRC-20 dead in its tracks by paying a higher fee and setting its total supply to one\u2014all in a fraction of a second.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was kind of a proof of concept to demonstrate this design flaw,\u201d @rot13maxi said of the Sophon. \u201cIf you want to have a global namespace\u2014that's first come first serve [...]\u2014then you have to account for the fact that anybody can see that you're in the mempool, and anybody can come and take [a token\u2019s name] from you.\u201d\n\nThe Sophon was activated on October 3, and text-based inscriptions plummeted 72% to 13,700 from 49,000 the day before, according to a popular Dune dashboard. And a day after the bot\u2019s funds were depleted on October 23, text-based inscriptions jumped 540% to 74,300 from 11,500.\n\nIn total, @rot13maxi said the Sophon derailed the deployment of around 275 fledgling BRC-20s, with a 75% success rate. He said he spent about 0.013 Bitcoin ($500 in today\u2019s prices) to keep the bot running for a few weeks in October.\n\n\u201cWhen it ran out of money, I just decided I'm not going to keep pumping money into this if nobody cares,\u201d @rot13maxi said. \u201cSo, I turned it off. And now everybody is clamoring for it back.\u201d\n\nYes! But we need sophon back @rot13maxi \u2014 raph (@raphjaph) November 6, 2023\n\nOf the people on Twitter calling for the Sophon\u2019s return on Monday was @raphjaph, Ordinals\u2019 pseudonymous lead maintainer, who took over the day-to-day oversight of the protocol in May after its creator, Casey Rodarmor, signaled he was taking a step back from the project.\n\nWhile the figures may sound small, a single transaction deploying a BRC-20 can result in thousands upon thousands more, as speculators rush to snatch up its predetermined supply, Charlie Spears of Bitcoin mining firm Luxor Technologies told Decrypt.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the primary driver of BRC-20 volume [...], the vast majority of BRC-20 events are mint functions,\u201d Spears said, estimating that 80% to 90% of BRC-20 transactions are people claiming created tokens, or \u201cjust minting and speculating on the price.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs of this writing, Spears said about 20 BRC-20s had been deployed with a supply of one over the past day, suggesting that some form of the Sophon came back online on Wednesday.\n\nMonsters in the Mempool\n\nSci-fi fans may already be familiar with the name Sophon. @rot13maxi\u2019s bot is named after an antagonistic supercomputer in Remembrance of Earth's Past, a three-part series by Chinese writer Liu Cixin. It's likely best-known for its first novel, \"The Three-Body Problem,\" which is set to debut as a televsion series on Netflix in 2024. In the tale, an alien civilization releases the Sophon on Earth, crippling its scientific progress using its small size.\n\n\u201cThe Sophon was this little supercomputer that was the size of a proton, that would fly in front of particle accelerators and block them\u201d in Cixin\u2019s books, @rot13maxi said. \u201cSo my bot flies in front of the BRC-20 deployments and blocks them.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Sophon is not infallible, he noted. Someone trying to create a BRC-20 could always skate by unscathed by paying a higher fee, @rot13maxi said. Or, they could also ask the Sophon\u2019s operator to turn it off\u2014part of his reasoning for considering a public release.\n\n\u201cI feel like that's not really keeping with the spirit of this thing,\u201d @rot13maxi said of keeping the bot in the hands of a few. \u201cYou have to assume that there are monsters lurking in the mempool that will come and eat your protocol if they're vulnerable.\u201d"

        "title": "The History of the Mt Gox Hack: Bitcoin's Biggest Heist - Blockonomi",
        "content": "At the beginning of 2014, Mt Gox, a bitcoin exchange based in Japan, was the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, handling over 70% of all bitcoin transactions worldwide. By the end of February of that year, it was bankrupt.\n\nAnyone who was using Mt. Gox lost access to their assets, and it has been a cautionary tale for crypto investors. While the assets weren\u2019t all lost, anything that was left has been frozen for years.\n\nNow, it looks like things might be turning a corner, but there are still many unknowns. Before we talk about how there could be a resolution on the horizon, let\u2019s look at how we got here in the first place.\n\nThe victim of a massive hack, Mt. Gox lost about 740,000 bitcoins (6% of all bitcoin in existence at the time), valued at the equivalent of \u20ac460 million at the time and over $3 billion at October 2017 prices. An additional $27 million was missing from the company\u2019s bank accounts. Although 200,000 bitcoins were eventually recovered, the remaining 650,000 have never been recovered.\n\nThis post will discuss the rise and fall of Mt. Gox, the aftermath of the hack and the resulting (and ongoing) investigation and will consider whether it could happen again.\n\nFor a long time it looked like the creditors of Mt. Gox could be left empty handed, but there have been some new developments that may mean a return of capital to crypto traders who were left holding the bag when Mt. Gox went bust.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nMt. Gox was the largest bitcoin exchange handling 70% of transactions in early 2014\n\nIt was hacked in 2014 resulting in the loss of 740,000 bitcoins worth $3B+\n\nOnly 200,000 bitcoins have been recovered leaving 650,000 still missing\n\nMt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in 2014\n\nInvestigations found the exchange was hacked as early as 2011\n\nThe hack drained the hot wallets and cold storage\n\nCEO Mark Karpeles was arrested in 2015 but has pleaded not guilty\n\nA new civil rehabilitation process began in 2019 to repay creditors\n\nThe repayment deadline has been extended to Oct 31, 2024\n\nThe Rise of the Mt Gox Exchange\n\nLaunched in 2010 by US programmer Jed McCaleb (who later went on to found Ripple), Mt Gox expanded rapidly to become by far the most popular bitcoin exchange in the world after being purchased by French developer and bitcoin enthusiast Mark Karpel\u00e9s in March 2011. Rather bizarrely the name Mt Gox stood for \u201cMagic: The Gathering Online eXchange\u201d.\n\nIn June 2011 the Mt. Gox exchange was hacked, most likely as a result of a compromised computer belonging to an auditor of the company. On that occasion, the hacker used their access to the exchange to artificially alter the nominal value of bitcoin to one cent and then transfer an estimated 2,000 bitcoins from customer accounts on the exchange, which were then sold.\n\nIn addition, an estimated 650 bitcoins were purchased from the exchange at the artificially low price by Mt. Gox customers, none of which were ever returned. As a result of this hack Mt. Gox took a number of security measures, including arranging for a substantial amount of its bitcoin to be taken offline and held in cold storage.\n\nIn spite of the June 2011 hack, by 2013 Mt. Gox had established itself as the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, in part as a result of increased interest in bitcoin as the price of the coins increased rapidly (jumping from $13 dollars in January 2013 to a peak of more than $1,200).\n\nHowever, behind the scenes all was not well.\n\nThe Struggles behind the scenes\n\nAlthough Mt. Gox had quickly expanded to become the largest bitcoin exchange in the world by 2013, behind the scenes it was struggling.\n\nSince its collapse, a number of Mt. Gox employees have spoken about how Mt. Gox was operating, with a picture being painted of a disorganized and discordant organization, with poor security procedures, serious issues relating to the source code of the website and a number of serious issues arising in relation to the operation of the business.\n\nIn May 2013, a former business partner of Mt. Gox called Coinlab sued the company for $75 million, claiming breach of contract. The two companies had signed an agreement under which Coinlab would take over Mt. Gox\u2019s American customers but, according to Coinlab\u2019s lawsuit, the deal failed to materialize due to Mt. Gox breaching a clause of the contract.\n\nIn addition, the US Department of Homeland Security was investigating claims that a subsidiary of Mt. Gox operating in the US was not licensed and was therefore operating as an unregistered money transmitter. As a result of this investigation, more than $5 million was seized by the US government from the company\u2019s bank accounts.\n\nAs a result of the US investigation, Mt. Gox had announced a temporarily suspension of withdrawals in US dollars. Although this suspension only nominally lasted for one month, many customers were experiencing delays of up to 3 months in withdrawing cash from their accounts and few US dollar withdrawals were being successfully completed.\n\nAll these delays resulted in Mt. Gox losing its place as the largest bitcoin exchange in the world by the end of 2013, falling to third.\n\nHowever, as it turned out, these issues were the tip of the iceberg. Underneath the hood, Mt. Gox had much bigger problems than it realized. It had been the victim of an ongoing hacking for over two years.\n\nThe Mt. Gox hack\n\nOn 7 February 2014, Mt. Gox stopped all bitcoin withdrawals, claiming that it was merely pausing withdrawal requests \u201cto obtain a clear technical view of the currency process.\u201d\n\nAfter a number of weeks of uncertainty, on 24 February 2014, the exchange suspended all trading and the website went offline.\n\nThat same week, a leaked corporate document claimed that hackers had raided that Mt. Gox exchange and stole 744,408 bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox customers, as well as an additional 100,000 bitcoins belonging to the company, resulting in the exchange being declared to be insolvent.\n\nOn 28 February Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan, and in the US two weeks later.\n\nSubsequent investigations have shown that the massive hack of Mt. Gox had begun as early as September 2011.\n\nAs a result of all this, Mt. Gox was operating while technically insolvent for almost two years and had practically lost all of its bitcoins by mid-2013. Additional evidence has suggested that Mt. Gox was already missing up to 80,000 bitcoins from its exchange even before Mark Karpel\u00e9s purchased the exchange in 2011.\n\nAlthough it remains an ongoing investigation and the facts remain unclear at this time, it is presumed that most of the bitcoins that were stolen from Mt. Gox were taken from its online (or hot) wallets, including all of the currency being held in cold storage, due to a \u201cleak\u201d in the hot wallet.\n\nAn online cryptocurrency wallet is a web-based wallet used to store secure digital codes, known as private keys that show ownership of a public digital code, known as a public key, that can be used to access the currency addresses and it is this information that is stored in a wallet.\n\nPrior to September 2011, the Mt. Gox private key was unencrypted and it would appear that it was stolen via a copied wallet.dat file, either by hacking or perhaps through an insider.\n\nOnce the file was hacked, the hacker(s) were able to access and cipher bitcoins gradually from the wallets associated with Mt. Gox\u2019s private keys without the hack being detected.\n\nThe shared keypool of the copied file led to address re-use, which meant that the company appeared to be oblivious to the theft, with the Mt. Gox systems interpreting the transfers as deposits apparently being moved to more secure addresses.\n\nWhenever the wallets emptied, the Mt Gox system\u2019s interpretation of the theft as deposits resulted in an additional 40,000 extra bitcoins being credited to multiple user accounts.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nIn March 2014, Mt. Gox reported on its website that it had found 200,000 bitcoins in old-format digital wallets that had been used by the exchange prior to June 2011. These bitcoins remain held on trust for creditors while the company remains under bankruptcy protection.\n\nMark Karpel\u00e9s was arrested in Japan in August 2015 and charged with fraud and embezzlement, although none of these charges directly relate to the theft. He was imprisoned until July 2016, when he was released on bail.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his trial is ongoing.\n\nMt. Gox remains under bankruptcy protection, with the case still being under investigation. In addition, the litigation with CoinLab remains outstanding and distribution to creditors cannot occur until that lawsuit is settled.\n\nWhere did the money go?\n\n650,000 bitcoins remain unaccounted for as a result of the Mt. Gox hack. A number of online theories have been developed as to where the missing coins are.\n\nSome have suggested that Mt. Gox never had the amount of coins that it claimed, and that Karpel\u00e9s had manipulated the numbers to make it appear that Mt. Gox held more bitcoin than it in fact held.\n\nIn respect of how the hacker was able to access the bitcoins that Mt. Gox held in cold storage, the theories range from suggestions that the storage may have been compromised by an individual with on-site access to suggestions that the cold storage coins were gradually deposited into the Mt. Gox exchange system when a hot wallet ran low, and that a lack of accountability among staff simply meant that there was no awareness that the wallets were being drained by hackers.\n\nIn July 2017, a Russian national named Alexander Vinnik was arrested by US authorities in Greece and charged with playing a key role in the laundering of bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox. In additional Vinnick was charged by Greek authorities for laundering of approximately $4 billion in bitcoin.\n\nVinnick is alleged to be associated with BTC-e, a well-established bitcoin exchange, which was raided by the FBI as part of the investigation.\n\nThe BTC-e site has been shut down and the domain & web hosting accounts seized by the FBI, the first time the US government has seized a foreign exchange on foreign soil.\n\nInvestigations by Wizsec, a group of bitcoin security specialists, had identified Vinnik as the owner of the wallets into which the stolen bitcoins had been transferred, many of which were sold on BTC-e.\n\nWith the trial of Mark Karpel\u00e9s ongoing in Japan and the indictment against Vinnik, it would appear that the separate strands of the investigation into the Mt. Gox hack are finally coming together.\n\nWhether any of this will result in the recovery of all or any of the stolen bitcoins remains to be seen, but it does appear that we will have at least some clarity into the Mt. Gox hack in the near future.\n\n\u201cGoxRising\u201d-A New Path Forward\n\nIn February of 2019, TechCrunch reported that a movement called GoxRising was working to pursue an alternative to bankruptcy for Mt. Gox.\n\nThe idea behind GoxRising is simple: instead of use the bankruptcy courts to hand over Mt. Gox\u2019s assets to the owners of the company, it is using civil rehabilitation law to return the most it can to the creditors of the company.\n\nIt would appear that GoxRising has been successful in its efforts, as Tokyo lawyer Nobuaki Kobayashi has been appointed by Japanese courts to handle the civil rehabilitation process. This is good news for anyone who lost their assets in the Mt. Gox failure, as they will likely gain much more as a result of civil rehabilitation.\n\nThere is also another potential upside for Mark Karpeles, the embattled CEO of Mt. Gox.\n\nIf the bankruptcy process had continued to move forward, it is likely that Karpeles would\u2019ve ended up with a lot of Mt. Gox\u2019s assets. He owned around 80% of the company when it went bust, putting him in pole position for a massive payout under Japanese bankruptcy law.\n\nKarpeles knows that if he ended up with most of the Mt. Gox stash, his life would be in limbo. First, he would face a barrage of civil suits from Mt. Gox creditors who had lost everything to him. Bitcoin prices are much higher today than they were in 2014, which would just add insult to injury.\n\nAlso, jilted investors may not be satisfied with simply suing Karpeles. People have been killed for far, far less than what Karpeles would have done, if he ended up walking away with a massive pile of Bitcoins after everyone who trusted him got burned.\n\nNeedless to say, the civil rehabilitation process seems like a winning idea for everyone involved, and it looks like it is moving forward. Kobayashi was put into his position earlier this year, and the civil rehabilitation is expected to take 3-5 years, according to reports in the media.\n\nCivil rehabilitation is still a time-consuming process, but it does look a lot better than bankruptcy!\n\nLessons Learned\n\nThe pivot to civil rehabilitation is emblematic of how much different the crypto world is from the established financial system. Bankruptcy law was a terrible framework to address the failure of Mt. Gox, and would\u2019ve created an unjust situation that may have led to massive amounts if litigation, and potentially illegal acts.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that Karpeles was actually planning to defraud people who were using Mt. Gox, and his life has been rough since the exchange went belly-up. He has faced multiple lawsuits already, can\u2019t leave Japan, and also did some jail time before getting released into the land of the rising sun on a limited basis.\n\nNot a lot of fun for anyone!\n\nNow, it looks like there is a way forward that would get Karpeles out of his unenviable situation, and make sure anyone whose assets assets were frozen in 2014 got them back.\n\nThe clear lesson to the crypto community is that there need to be better structures in place for when the worst happens, as it is absurd that people are still waiting to gain access to their property.\n\nThe Centralized Crypto Exchange Dilemma\n\nCrypto assets lend themselves to decentralized networks. Despite that, the exchanges that offer the best prices and deepest liquidity are almost universally centralized. While the centralized nature of the exchanges isn\u2019t inherently an issue, the fact they they act as custodians isn\u2019t ideal.\n\nOnce an entity takes ownership over an asset, the potential for a Mt. Gox-esque scenario exists. Given the kind of laws that govern bankruptcy in the established financial system, the way cryptos are traded does appear to be less-than-perfect.\n\nThere are decentralized exchanges that offer a wide range of trading services, but they are unlikely to be able to match centralized crypto exchanges, especially when it comes to inter-exchange interface.\n\nThe ability to trade directly with other centralized crypto exchanges is a big advantage, and it is difficult to see how that could happen without custodianship.\n\nA Horror Story for Institutional Investors\n\nCustodial issues are one of the biggest issues for institutional investors when it comes to cryptos. Far from being paranoid speculation, the Mt. Gox situation gives any money manager who is being pressured to invest in cryptos a terrible example that could scare anyone out of the sector.\n\nThe idea that a hack could turn an entire exchange illiquid and keep any of the traders from accessing their assets isn\u2019t going to win cryptos many proponents in the investment banking community. If cryptos are going to grow, the \u2018Custodial Question\u2019 has to be addressed.\n\nUnfortunately, the crypt world grew out of boot-strapped platforms and business structures that were never intended to appeal to the world of high-finance. Now that more people are interested in cryptos, these sub-par systems are holding back the industry in a big way.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how professional a trading interface looks, the back office is what really matters when it comes to attracting the big money. If chain-of-custody and ownership can\u2019t be established quickly, and by an outside auditor, nothing else really matters.\n\nCould it happen again?\n\nThe short answer is that yes, it could.\n\nThere are many bitcoin exchanges operating at present, some of which are more reputable than others. Popular exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance are relatively transparent about their operations, as well as offering insured deposits, and are backed by reputable venture capitalists.\n\nHowever, they are also going to be the targets of the best hackers, who will be only too happy to exploit any security gaps.\n\nDecentralized exchanges generally don\u2019t act as a custodian for you assets, which means Mt. Gox couldn\u2019t happen to you.\n\nIn addition, there are many smaller exchanges currently trading that aren\u2019t as clear about how they operate. That does not mean that such exchanges are operating a hack or disreputable in any way.\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrency trading, it is recommended that you use the more reputable exchanges, if only for your own peace of mind, unless you have the means to absolutely guarantee the legitimacy of any smaller exchange that you are dealing with.\n\nAnd if the above isn\u2019t enough to scare you, my one last word of advice would be to make sure that you don\u2019t store your bitcoins on any exchange. See our post on cryptocurrency wallets for more details on how to store your bitcoins.\n\nMT Gox Update 2023\n\nAs of 2023, The long-running Mt. Gox saga continues, as trustees for the hacked cryptocurrency exchange have announced a deadline extension for repaying creditors. Originally ordered to finish distributions by October 31, 2023, the trustee now has until October 31, 2024 to complete the repayment process.\n\nThis marks the second major deadline extension, as creditors have waited nearly a decade to recoup losses from the infamous 2014 hack.\n\nWhile around 200,000 of those coins have since been recovered, creditors are still owed around 650,000 BTC from the hack. With bitcoin\u2019s value exponentially higher now compared to 2014, that stolen sum is worth close to $23 billion today.\n\nThe Tokyo-based trustee managing distributions cites technical and administrative delays as reasons for pushing the deadline back another full year. This includes time spent hunting for more of the missing bitcoin and organizing the process for evaluating creditor claims.\n\nThe repayment is slated to proceed in both BTC and fiat currency at creditor\u2019s request. Analysts expect the release of tens of thousands of bitcoins may impact prices to some degree, though markets are much more liquid today.\n\nFor Mt. Gox victims, the deadline extension provides closure on any hopes of receiving funds in 2023. But it also promises progress by finally making creditors whole after years of waiting.\n\nWe will update as the story progresses."

        "content": "Despite the impressive performance of bitcoin this year, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise Asset Management, believes that the widely expected approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is not yet priced in.\n\nRecent data from CoinDesk Indices revealed that the price of bitcoin (BTC) briefly reached $36,000 before paring some of the gains during Asian trading hours on November 9.\n\nBitcoin has experienced a 30 percent increase in the last month and a remarkable 93 percent increase over the past year. Other major digital assets, including ether (ETH), have also seen positive gains, with ETH up 20 percent in the last month.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nDespite the impressive performance of bitcoin this year, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise Asset Management, believes that the widely expected approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is not yet priced in.\n\nHe explains that potential ETF buyers are not aware that it is coming or expect it to be approved until 2025 or later. Therefore, if these buyers do not anticipate its approval in the next two months, it cannot be considered priced in.\n\nHougan emphasises the significant role that ETFs will play in expanding cryptocurrency investments to a broader range of investors, particularly financial advisors who manage a substantial portion of the U.S.' wealth. Currently, only 20 percent of self-directed retail investors have bought crypto, while 80 percent of America's wealth is controlled by financial advisors and institutions who require an ETF to access crypto.\n\nHe compares the potential impact of a bitcoin ETF to the launch of gold ETFs in the early 2000s, which led to a prolonged period of gold price increases. Hougan suggests that BlackRock's filing for a spot bitcoin ETF in June had a significant psychological impact on the market, dispelling the negative sentiment caused by the FTX collapse.\n\nAlso read: Bankman-Fried's trial exposed crypto fraud but Congress has not been eager to regulate the industry\n\nMoreover, coincidentally, an anonymous source recently revealed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is engaged in with Grayscale Investments. The talks are regarding their application to convert Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThis development holds significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry. The approval of an ETF application by the SEC is highly anticipated as it has the potential to make digital assets more accessible to everyday investors.

The talks are ongoing and remain confidential at this time."

        "content": "Bitcoin has more than doubled in value in 2023 after a turbulent ride over the past few years.\n\nHaving reached a record high price of $69,000 in late 2021, the cryptocurrency's value subsequently plunged by over three-quarters in the following 12 months.\n\nBut bitcoin has soared by around 121 per cent to beyond $37,000 in 2023, despite high-profile examples of financial crime in the cryptocurrency world, and concerns about its environmental impact and utility.\n\nTurbulence: Having reached a record high price of $69,000 in late 2021, bitcoin's value plunged the following year. But during 2023, it has more than doubled its price\n\nThere have been four major spikes in the digital currency's value since the year began, with the first happening during mid-to-late January when a group of large investors - known as 'whales' - bought bitcoin in significant quantities.\n\nThat coincided with markets predicting interest rates would start to go down after central banks hiked them continuously the previous year to try and reduce inflation.\n\nBitcoin surged again in March as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank triggered major turmoil throughout the American and European banking systems, with Credit Suisse having to be rescued by rival UBS.\n\nThe uncertainty saw more retail investors decide to plough their money into perceived safer havens, including gold and larger cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBy the end of March, bitcoin had risen to about $28,500, 71 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year.\n\nOver the next three months, the currency enjoyed a couple of mini-bumps before trending downwards, partly due to Chinese regulators banning financial institutions from supporting Bitcoin.\n\nSurging value: Bitcoin has soared by around 121 per cent to beyond $37,000 in 2023\n\nYet it shot up in mid-June when BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, filed an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nUnlike a future-based ETF, a spot-bitcoin ETF is an investment vehicle that directly owns some bitcoins through which investors have exposure without actually having to hold them.\n\nThe SEC has been reluctant to sanction such funds under the chairmanship of Gary Gensler, partly due to bitcoin's volatility and its widespread use by fraudsters.\n\nBut in October, it decided not to contest a court decision saying the watchdog was wrong to turn down an application by Grayscale Investments to convert its crypto fund into an ETF.\n\nThat set off bitcoin's fourth and final big rally in 2023. It has now climbed by more than a third in the past month.\n\nSoon after the SEC chose not to appeal, BlackRock's iShares ETF turned up on the website of clearing house Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation before being taken down just hours later, then reappearing soon afterwards.\n\nThe BlackRock ETF is one of 12 that the SEC could approve in a 'window' lasting until 17 November, according to Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas.\n\nAhead of this, investors have been putting money into alternative cryptoassets, such as ethereum, BNB and dogecoin, further uplifting Bitcoin's prices.\n\nIf any spot bitcoin ETFs get the thumbs up, this could send bitcoin's price further skyrocketing as pension funds, retail, and institutional investors are more likely to invest in cryptocurrency.\n\nShould none get accepted, Seyffart and Balchunas have said 'there's a 90 per cent chance' of one being approved before 10 January."
