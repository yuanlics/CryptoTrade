        "title": "Bitcoin NFTs: What Makes BTC JPEGs so Extra-Ordinal? - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Whether you call them Bitcoin NFTs, digital artifacts, or Ordinals, these new JPEGs are brewing up a storm and making waves across the crypto space. With Bitcoin Punks selling for upwards of 1.1 BTC (17.50 ETH), non-fungible tokens on the bitcoin blockchain are not to be ignored.\n\nSince when has the Bitcoin network become the hottest place to trade NFTs? What does this mean for BTC transaction fees, and why is the Bitcoin community against all this newfound interest?\n\nMost importantly, which Bitcoin NFT collection will be the next Bored Apes, and how can I buy these trending digital assets?\n\nWhat Are BTC Ordinals?\n\nThe Ordinal protocol allows users to inscribe data, like an image or file, onto an individual satoshi. In the same way that 100 cents make up one dollar, 100,000,000 satoshis = 1 BTC. Casey Rodarmor, the founder behind the protocol, claims that these digital artifacts \u201creflect what NFTs should be.\u201d\n\nWhile upgradeable NFT standards and enforceable royalties have become popular on other blockchains, Bitcoin NFTs are truly immutable, permissionless, and censorship-resistant. This leads to some creative use cases, as speculated by the wider Bitcoin community:\n\nBitcoin NFTs are slightly different from their cousins over on Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Ordinal NFTs store the entirety of the inscribed data directly on-chain instead of simply linking a JPEG to a non-fungible token.\n\nAll this was made possible following a loophole Casey Rodarmor discovered in the latest Bitcoin Taproot upgrade. Limited only by block size, data can now be stored on-chain on the world\u2019s most decentralized blockchain. What\u2019s more, the protocol doesn\u2019t really on any smart contracts. While this arguably streamlines the protocol, it complicates future utilities like DeFi integrations.\n\nAre Ordinals the First Bitcoin NFTs?\n\nDespite what the newer generation of cryptocurrency enthusiasts might believe, this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen NFTs on the bitcoin network. Crypto veterans will remember NameCoin NFTs, which, while not quite resembling today\u2019s Apes and Punks, are widely considered the first non-fungible tokens.\n\nIn 2015, the Counterparty network hosted NFT trading card games and the now-iconic RarePepe Card Collection. While these early NFTs are technically considered Counterparty NFTs, they used bitcoin network functions to anchor references on the original blockchain, giving them their place in Bitcoin history.\n\nBitcoin Community and JPEGs: More Controversy\n\nLike any revolutionary new technology, Bitcoin NFTs have divided the Bitcoin community into two camps. Bitcoin maximalists have shunned Ordinals from the outset, arguing that BTC is a financial instrument. They believe that adding Ordinal NFTs into the mix only corrupts the network and dilutes the value of the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin NFTs have arguably brought renewed interest to the network and raised the ceiling on potential use cases for Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals add an additional layer of culture and history to the bitcoin archives, while also benefitting BTC miners thanks to boosted transaction fees. Network congestion leads to limited block space and a spike in BTC gas.\n\nComplications with Bitcoin NFTs\n\nBefore strapping on your FOMO boots and diving into the non-existent Bitcoin Metaverse, there are a few things you need to know. The Ordinal NFT ecosystem is still in its infancy and demands a high level of technical knowledge to navigate effectively.\n\nFirst of all, there is no NFT marketplace on the bitcoin network. All Ordinal NFT trades are completed through trusted peer-to-peer trades in Discord servers and telegram channels. As is often the case, these trading environments attract plenty of scammers and nefarious actors.\n\nIf you\u2019re trading Bitcoin NFTs OTC, do your due diligence and use a reliable middleman or intermediary.\n\nAs if the barrier to entry wasn\u2019t already high enough, things just get more complex. You can\u2019t sell, transfer or trade a native Ordinal NFT unless you\u2019re running a full bitcoin node on your computer. Setting up a node isn\u2019t easy, and syncing it up with the bitcoin network can take up to three days.\n\nFortunately, there is an easier way to create a Bitcoin NFT. Sites like Ordinals.bot and Gamma.io simplify the process but severely limit your BTC transactions. Unless you\u2019re running a node, you still won\u2019t be able to sell or transfer your NFT.\n\nFinally, you can currently only hold one Ordinal NFT per bitcoin wallet. What\u2019s more, if you accidentally send the satoshi that your Bitcoin NFT is inscribed on, you\u2019ll lose it forever, even if you\u2019re sending it to a trusted crypto exchange like Binance.\n\nDiving into the world of Bitcoin NFTs is a bit of a jungle. The high barrier to entry has only added to the scarcity and FOMO surrounding these digital artifacts, which have been exploding on crypto news platforms. Thankfully, there are a few workarounds that make things easier.\n\nHow to Trade BTC Ordinals on Ethereum\n\nThere is a solution if you\u2019re itching to get your hands on a Bitcoin NFT but don\u2019t have the technical knowledge or time to go through the exhausting Ordinal onboarding process.\n\nEmblem Vaults are a unique approach to NFT trading that allows users to package data from other chains like Bitcoin and Dogecoin into an Ethereum NFT. Each Emblem Vault contains private keys for data, like NFTs, that are stored on other blockchains. Emblem Vaults make it possible to trade NFTs from other networks like Bitcoin and Solana as if they were Ethereum NFTs.\n\nOne could argue that this represents peak irony in the crypto space. Even after all these years and all the progress the industry has witnessed, we\u2019re still generating Ethereum-native punk art on other chains. This isn\u2019t a new idea, but this is the first time we\u2019ve started repackaging these outsider punks to resell them on Ethereum.\n\nAs always, buying Emblem Vaults on Opensea carries an element of risk. Because anything can be coded into an Emblem Vault, it\u2019s difficult to know if the vault you\u2019re looking at contains a genuine Bitcoin Punk. Seeing the same Ordinal NFT listed three times in a row undoubtedly raises some red flags.\n\nIt\u2019s recommended to always conduct thorough research before buying any Emblem Vaults claiming to contain Bitcoin NFTs. Otherwise, you find yourself chalking up more capital losses on your crypto taxes.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nOrdinal NFTs are the latest gold rush in the crypto market; however, the high barrier to entry makes it difficult to navigate and gives scammers and bad actors a platform to take advantage of unaware users.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nBitcoin NFTs are increasing network congestion on the Bitcoin network. While this is great for Bitcoin miners, regular users suffer from higher transaction fees and network congestion.\n\nFAQs"

        "title": "The impact of Ordinals on Bitcoin mempools & transaction size - CryptoSlate",
        "content": "The introduction of the Ordinals Protocol, which enables the development of Bitcoin-based NFTs, has coincided with significant changes to mempool activity and transaction size, new data by CryptoSlate and Glassnode show.\n\nWhat are Bitcoin Ordinals?\n\nThe ability to mint non-fungible tokens directly onto Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain with all associated content, such as images and videos, is made possible by Ordinal NFTs, also known as digital artifacts or inscriptions.\n\nLaunched in January 2023, the Ordinals protocol allows users to interact with and exchange individual satoshis that may contain unique inscribed data. This new approach to creating NFTs on Bitcoin takes advantage of changes included in the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade. It involves placing the complete content of the NFT directly on-chain, providing a novel way to explore, transfer, and receive such tokens.\n\nWhen combined with the SEC\u2019s decision to exempt Bitcoin from the \u201csecurity\u201d classification, some experts say a bullish outlook for Bitcoin begins to emerge, which could positively impact the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nQuantitative analysis\n\nAccording to recent Glassnode data sourced in conjunction with CryptoSlate, the aftermath of Ordinals has positively impacted Bitcoin. However, the data suggests there are factors to consider in relation to the \u2018health\u2019 of the Bitcoin network. For example, the mean size of transactions increased by over 100%, from 600 B (bytes) to 1100 B.\n\nHowever, the below chart illustrates that Ordinal transactions have low satoshi fees (purple color dominant).\n\nThe total fees (USD Value) of transactions waiting in the mempool in different size (vByte) cohorts have increased since FTX collapsed, and inscriptions have lifted the baseline fee from 1 \u2013 4 satoshis. The congestion within the mempools was raised partly due to an increase in space needed to store Ordinals inscriptions compared to standard transaction data. In addition, a surge in Bitcoin usage during the FTX saga, as investors led an exodus in exchange-held crypto, played a role in the November spike.\n\nGlassnode data shows that Bitcoin\u2019s mean block size upper range has increased significantly since the launch of Ordinals, rising from 1.5-2.0 MB to 3.0-3.5 MB within a few weeks. The increase correlates with not only images but larger files such as audio and video starting to be stored as Ordinals.\n\nNotably, on Feb. 1, Inscription 652, the first piece in the Taproot Wizards collection, set a new record as the largest block and transaction in the history of Bitcoin, reaching 4 MB in size. Additionally, on Feb. 17., CryptoSlate reported on a fart that had been uploaded to the Ordinal network, inscription 2042.\n\nQualitative analysis\n\nGlassnode shows that while the Ordinal network has had a significant impact on Bitcoin transaction hash size and cost, qualitatively, this may be connected to a broader crackdown on proof-of-stake mechanisms.\n\nThe majority of other layer-1 crypto protocols, which refer to base-layer blockchains having their own native tokens, are built on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, including Ethereum.\n\nHowever, with the SEC\u2019s crackdown on Kraken\u2019s staking service in the United States, which suggests that only highly sophisticated retail investors can partake in validating networks of such blockchains, it appears that investing in ETH and similar tokens could become the exclusive domain of institutional players, leading to improvements to the Ordinal network.\n\nAs a result, the Ordinals Protocol is being hailed as a game-changer for the Bitcoin blockchain. By enabling the creation of Bitcoin-based NFTs, it has given the world\u2019s most famous cryptocurrency a new purpose beyond just facilitating peer-to-peer transactions. This is particularly significant, given that the mainstream appeal of Bitcoin has arguably been hindered by factors like banking system regulations and its volatile price swings.\n\nAs evidenced by data from Glassnode, intense bullish activity appears to be forming around the Ordinal network.\n\nFeatured Data Partner\n\nMentioned in this article"

By driving up transaction fees, the creation of Ordinals will incentivize miners to secure the network while the revenue from mining rewards will decrease with each Bitcoin halving.\n\n\u201cBecause the block space is scarce and because there\u2019s demand for stuff like inscriptions, there\u2019s a lot of hope that we will get enough people who want to pay fees in order to keep the Bitcoin network secure,\u201d Wertheimer explained in a recent interview with Cointelegraph.\n\nAlso, Wertheimer noted, Ordinals provide a new use case to make building on Bitcoin commercially profitable.\n\n\u201cWith all of that interest around Ordinals and inscriptions, I expect that there is going to be a very big ecosystem that is built around that,\u201d he said.\n\nWertheimer dismisses the notion held by some Bitcoin core developers that creating NFTs is not an appropriate use case for Bitcoin. According to him, in recent years, Bitcoin core developers \u201chave ignored what actual Bitcoin users want.\u201c\n\nTo learn more about Ordinals and how they impact the Bitcoin network, watch the full interview on our YouTube channel and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!"

        "content": "A popular crypto analyst just unveiled his long-term target for Bitcoin\u2019s current cycle \u2013 and it\u2019s a big one.\n\nThe pseudonymous trader, whose alter ego is Filbfilb, tells his 85,000 Twitter followers that his target for the top cryptocurrency is now $180,000.\n\nThe analyst points to Bitcoin\u2019s halving, which is now about a year away, as the key catalyst.\n\nThe halving, which happens every four years, will reduce the amount of new BTC entering the market from 6.25 Bitcoin per block to 3.125 Bitcoin per block.\n\nThe tightening of supply has historically coincided with major moves in Bitcoin\u2019s price, and the trader believes this time will be no different.\n\n\u201cBitcoin halving is due for March 2024.

        "content": "Although it's possible to buy cryptos like Bitcoin with a credit card, you should think very carefully before you do.\n\nWhile a credit card might seem like a convenient payment option, there are some serious downsides you need to consider, including excess fees and the risk of your payment being blocked. And, it can be tricky to find a crypto trading platform that accepts credit card payments.\n\nThis is not an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering. It is not a recommendation to trade or use any services.\n\nHow to buy Bitcoin with credit card\n\nIf you've decided to buy Bitcoin with credit card from an exchange, there are a few steps you will need to follow.\n\nChoose a platform that accepts credit cards First you will need to find a platform that actually accepts credit card payments. There are a small number of platforms including crypto exchanges, investment apps and brokers that may let you pay by card. Create an account Regardless of which service you use to buy Bitcoin with a credit card, you will need to create an account. At a minimum, this requires you to sign up with an email and password. Additionally, most exchanges will require you to pass a Know Your Customer (KYC) process which involves photo ID. Make your purchase The next step is to actually purchase Bitcoin with your credit card. This requires you to provide your full credit card details. Depending on the service provider, they will also ask for billing details such as the associated address, along with the name on the card. Once the details of the credit card have been entered, then you can choose the amount of Bitcoin you would like to purchase. Remember \u2013 you can purchase less than 1 whole BTC. Store your crypto Trading platforms typically offer an in-built wallet to hold your Bitcoin on your behalf. If you don't plan on trading frequently, it's a good idea to consider transferring most of your funds to a personal crypto wallet for added security.\n\nPurchasing Bitcoin with a credit card might seem convenient but it carries a lot more risk than using funds in your bank account. Using a credit card means you are taking on debt which is going to compound rapidly if you don't pay it off immediately. Taking on debt to invest in anything \u2013 especially a volatile asset like Bitcoin \u2013 is particularly ill-advised because you could wind up losing more than your initial investment.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for the third consecutive week but Bitcoin (BTC) price decoupled and is on track to close the week near the strong overhead resistance at $25,211. This suggests that the wider crypto market recovery is on a strong footing.\n\nAfter Bitcoin\u2019s sharp rally from the lows, analysts remain divided in their opinion about its next move. Some traders believe that the current Bitcoin rally will turn down once again, while others expect the momentum to continue, starting a new bull phase.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nChances are that Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies will continue to rally until a vast majority of the bears turn bullish. After that happens, a sizable dip is likely. That could shake out several weak hands and give an opportunity to the stronger hands to add to their positions. A higher low followed by a higher high may confirm the end of the bear phase and signal the start of the next bull market.\n\nMeanwhile, select altcoins are looking strong and they may follow Bitcoin higher in the near term.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the charts to determine the critical levels to keep an eye on.\n\nBTC/USDT\n\nBitcoin is trading near the stiff overhead resistance at $25,211. The small trading range days on Feb. 18 and Feb. 19 indicate that bulls are not hurrying to book profits and the bears are wary of shorting at the current levels.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought territory indicate that bulls are firmly in command. A tight consolidation near a stiff overhead resistance usually resolves to the upside. If buyers catapult the price above $25,250, the BTC/USDT pair could accelerate to $31,000, as there is no major resistance in between.\n\nConversely, if the price dumps from the current level, it could find support at the 20-day exponential moving average ($23,115). The bears will have to pull the price below $22,800 to break the bullish momentum. The pair may then collapse to $21,480, which is likely to act as a strong support.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears aggressively sold the rally to $25,250 but they could not tug the price below the 20-EMA. This suggests that the sentiment remains strong and the bulls are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.\n\nBuyers are likely to have another go at the overhead resistance. If they manage to drive the price above $25,250, the next leg of the uptrend could begin.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-EMA. That will embolden the bears who will then try to sink the price to $22,800.\n\nFIL/USDT\n\nFilecoin (FIL) soared above the immediate resistance level of $7 on Feb. 17. This shows the intention of the bulls to start a new up-move.\n\nFIL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAfter a brief consolidation on Feb. 18, the bulls continued the up-move on Feb. 19. This strong rally indicates aggressive buying by the bulls. There is a minor resistance at $9.53 but that is likely to be crossed.\n\nThe FIL/USDT pair could then take aim at $11.39. This level is likely to act as a major obstacle, but if bulls do not allow the next pullback to dip back below $9.53, the uptrend may continue. The next resistance is at $16.\n\nThis positive view could negate in the near term if the price turns down from the current level and plummets below $7.\n\nFIL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears tried to stall the up-move at $8 but the bulls did not allow the price to slip back below the breakout level of $7. This indicates aggressive buying on every minor dip. The rally picked up pace and reached the overhead resistance at $9.53.\n\nSellers may mount a strong defense at this level but the upsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If bears want to stop the rally, they will have to yank the price back below $8.\n\nOKB/USDT\n\nWhile most cryptocurrencies are languishing far below their all-time high, OKB (OKB) has been consistently hitting a new high for the past few days. Any asset that hits a new all-time high possesses strength.\n\nOKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe OKB/USDT pair turned down on Feb. 18, indicating profit booking above $58. In a strong uptrend, corrections usually do not last for more than three to five days. If the price turns up from $50, the bulls will try to propel the pair above $59. If they succeed, the pair could start its journey toward $70.\n\nAnother possibility is that the pair corrects sharply and retests the support at $45. If buyers flip this level into support, the pair may consolidate between $45 and $58 for a few days. The bears will have to sink the price below $44 to gain the upper hand.\n\nOKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that buyers bought the dip to the 20-EMA but the rebound lacks strength. Although the moving averages are sloping up, the RSI is showing a negative divergence. This indicates a weakening bullish momentum. If the 20-EMA cracks, the pair could slide to $47.50 and then to $44.35.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns up and breaks above $55, the bulls may have another go at the all-time high at $58.84. If this level is cleared, the pair may resume its uptrend.\n\nRelated: 5 ways to monetize your digital art with NFTs\n\nVET/USDT\n\nVeChain (VET) successfully held the retest of the downtrend line and thereafter broke above the overhead resistance, indicating that the bears may be losing their grip.\n\nVET/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have turned up and the RSI is near the overbought zone. This suggests that bulls have the upper hand. If buyers flip the $0.028 level into support during the next pullback, the VET/USDT pair may surge toward the next overhead resistance at $0.034.\n\nBuyers are expected to protect this level with vigor because a break above it could indicate the start of a new uptrend. The pair may then rise to $0.05. This positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA ($0.025).\n\nVET/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls kicked the price above the overhead resistance, indicating the start of the next leg of the up-move. If bulls sustain the price above the breakout level, the pair may pick up momentum and quickly rally to $0.032 and then to $0.034.\n\nContrarily, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-EMA, several aggressive bulls may get trapped. That could start a deeper correction as longs bail out of their position. The pair may then slide to $0.022.\n\nRPL/USDT\n\nRocket Pool (RPL) has been in an uptrend for the past few days. The price has not broken below the 20-day EMA ($45) during pullbacks, indicating strong demand to buy at lower levels.\n\nRPL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe inside-day candlestick pattern on Feb. 18 and 19 shows that bears are trying to stall the uptrend near $56 but the bulls are not willing to surrender their advantage. If buyers thrust the price above $57, the RPL/USDT could march toward the next target objective at $74.\n\nOn the downside, the first support is at the psychological level of $50. If this level gives way, the pair may slip toward the 20-day EMA ($45). This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it may signal a trend change in the short term.\n\nRPL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that bears are trying to defend the $56 level but the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that buyers are holding on to their positions as they anticipate a break above the overhead resistance. If that happens, the pair could rise to $61 and thereafter to $74.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls have given up and are booking profits. That may result in a deeper correction to the 50-day simple moving average and then to $38.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "The economics of cryptocurrency mining: Costs, revenues and market trends - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Mining refers to the process of verifying and adding new transactions to a blockchain network, such as in the case of Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies. The economics of mining refers to the economic incentives and costs associated with the mining process, as well as its impact on the broader economy.\n\nThe economics of crypto mining are driven by a variety of factors, including cryptocurrency prices, mining difficulty, hardware costs, energy expenses, block rewards and transaction fees. This article will explain economics of mining, including costs, revenues and market trends.\n\nCryptocurrency mining costs\n\nThe costs associated with cryptocurrency mining can be broken down into several categories:\n\nHardware costs: The price of specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), for example, can have a big impact on the profitability of mining.\n\nEnergy expenses: Since mining uses a substantial quantity of electricity to run the computing equipment, energy consumption is one of the highest costs involved. Therefore, the profitability of mining can be significantly impacted by the cost of power in a particular area.\n\nCooling costs: The heat produced by mining equipment needs to be dispersed to keep the machinery in good condition. Costs associated with cooling can be high, particularly in hotter areas or in large-scale mining operations.\n\nMaintenance and repair costs: For mining equipment to operate at its best, constant maintenance and repairs are necessary, and these expenses can mount over time.\n\nTransaction fees: Miners may receive transaction fees in addition to block rewards for processing network transactions. The profitability of mining may be impacted by the level of transaction fees, which may change depending on network activity and other elements.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin miners as energy buyers, explained\n\nCryptocurrency mining revenues\n\nThe amount of cryptocurrency that a miner is able to produce over a specific time period is often used to determine how much mining revenue a miner generates. The revenue is determined by multiplying the value of the mined cryptocurrency by its current market price.\n\nConsider a scenario in which a miner employs mining equipment that can produce 1 BTC every 10 days. The miner\u2019s profit for each block produced would be as follows if the market price of BTC is $50,000:\n\nHowever, the amount of revenue made from mining cryptocurrencies fluctuates based on a number of variables, such as the price at which the cryptocurrency is currently trading on the market, the difficulty of the mining process, the price of power and the effectiveness of the mining equipment being utilized.\n\nFor example, in the early days of Bitcoin mining, it was possible to generate significant revenue with relatively simple hardware. The revenue per unit of computer power did, however, decline as mining complexity and the number of miners rose.\n\nRelated: How to build a cryptocurrency mining rig\n\nCryptocurrency mining market trends\n\nIn recent years, the cryptocurrency mining market has experienced significant growth and has become an increasingly important part of the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem.

        "content": "Bitcoin price is consolidating after finding strong resistance at the $25,000 level. This year, the primary cryptocurrency\u2019s price resurgence has been the major talking point, moving from $16k to $24k in a few weeks.\n\nThis trend continued as Bitcoin surpassed the $25k mark for the first time since August 2022 this week, and some experts had predicted that the $30k could be the next resistance point. However, this was not the case, and Bitcoin was quickly rejected at $25k.\n\nBitcoin Price Experiences Slight Correction At $25,000\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $24,478 and has been unable to break the $25,000 level decisively. Given the strong rejection at $25k, analysts believe Bitcoin may enter a period of consolidation before making a fresh move.\n\nRelated Reading: Dollar (DXY) Reaches Inflection Point, Critical Level For Crypto Continuation\n\nThe technical indicators also support a sideways movement in the near term as the two arms of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remain above the midpoint of 50. It should be noted that the most recent price action coincides with a surge in bitcoin\u2019s network activity which is near its all-time high.\n\nThis corresponds well with some bullish market sentiment and shows that a good portion of the recent rally is based on strong fundamentals. However, given the current market conditions, a new narrative may be needed to propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high.\n\nBitcoin will likely remain in a consolidation phase until more investors take a fresh look at the asset\u2019s potential. This suggests a balance in the buying and selling pressures and signals an indecisive market. As such, Bitcoin will likely remain in a tight range, only breaking out when a strong catalyst arrives.\n\nMoving forward, if bitcoin breaks the $25,000 level, it could trigger further upside momentum. On the other hand, if it fails to break through, it could mean that the rally has ended, and bitcoin will be at risk of a correction. Therefore, it is important that traders monitor the $25,000 resistance for any potential breakouts or breakdowns.\n\nBitcoin Network To Experience Growth With Ordinal NFTs\n\nThe Bitcoin network has continued to experience growth with the rise in the trend of NFTs minted on its blockchain. Ordinal NFTs began to be marketed through social networks at the beginning of the year.\n\nSo far this year, more than 130,000 NFTs, mostly images and text files, have been minted on the Bitcoin network, according to data from Dune. Although it is unknown how many total sales were made of these NFTs, some documents estimate that collections like Ordinal Punks have already grossed millions of dollars. This, supposedly, is through sales organized in private groups.\n\nRelated Reading: $212 Million Flushed In Crypto Futures As Bitcoin Surges Above $24,000\n\nAll this has brought disagreement among some bitcoiners who disapprove of the fact that this type of asset is being uploaded to the network and believe it could have detrimental effects in the future.\n\n-Featured Image from Unsplash.com, chart from TradingView.com"

To help you determine if bitcoin mining is suitable for you, this post will go through the ins and outs of the process, including the potential benefits, drawbacks, and how to get started.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Mining?\n\nBitcoin mining is a computationally and technologically sophisticated process verifying Bitcoin transactions on the network. It\u2019s quite similar to verifying a block on the chain network in exchange for Bitcoin payment.\n\nThose who work in this industry are referred to as \u201cminers.\u201d Because there is a fixed supply of Bitcoins, just like gold or oil, acquiring them is \u201cmining.\u201d There is a maximum of 21,000,000 Bitcoin in circulation. Bitcoin mining requires electricity as its source of energy to create Bitcoin.\n\nEven while mining Bitcoins may sound hard, it\u2019s relatively simple once you get the hang of it. A hash is a complicated integer consisting of 64 digits, and miners compete by trying to predict it. So the term \u201chash mining\u201d may be used to describe the process.\n\nMiners utilise high-powered computers to make predictions about the hash as rapidly as feasible. The first miner to guess the number accurately is rewarded with newly created Bitcoins. Remember that the machine is making all the number guesses here. The more powerful a computer is, the more predictions a miner can make each second, and the better their chances of succeeding.\n\nBitcoin mining is mainly done to validate ongoing transactions and bring new coins to circulation, eliminate counterfeiting and double-spend and maintain the ledger in a decentralised manner.\n\nMany Bitcoin miners opt to work together in \u201cmining pools,\u201d or organisations that pool resources and divide the reward. By joining a pool, you can increase your chances of adding a block to the blockchain, but doing so will reduce your payment.\n\nPros & Cons of Bitcoin mining\n\nYou should only enter the Bitcoin mining industry with careful consideration. Although the investment of time, effort, and money is high, it may be well worth it. Here are some of the benefits and drawbacks of bitcoin mining for you to make up your mind.\n\nBenefits of Bitcoin mining\n\nProven track record. PoW has been around for 13 years. Since then, there hasn\u2019t been a major security breach in the Bitcoin network. Many in the field attribute this to the massive amount of computer power needed to achieve such a high hash rate. While it\u2019s true that hackers have successfully brought down smaller PoW networks in the past, the same is hard for large PoS networks.\n\nPotential earnings. Dollars per terahash (TH) per second are the standard unit of Bitcoin profitability. In 2017, bitcoin mining produced $3.39/TH per second. Towards the year\u2019s conclusion in 2022, it was closer to $0.104/TH per second.\n\nCryptographic security. While hackers have compromised smaller PoW networks in the past, larger ones like Bitcoin have remained secure thus far. PoW might be the safest option when entrusting a network with substantial funds.\n\nRisks of Bitcoin mining\n\nUpfront costs. The upfront cost is the main negative of bitcoin mining. You need a specialised computer (a \u201cmining rig\u201d) to compete for block rewards. Even those parts of a mining pool require the right mining hardware. The expense of power must also be factored in. The mining machines consume a lot of energy, so if you\u2019re considering getting into Bitcoin mining, you should be prepared for a high monthly electricity expense.\n\nPrice volatility. There is uncertainty with Bitcoin, as there is with other digital currencies. When bitcoin prices drop very low, mining profits might become negligible. Since its inception in 2009, the value of bitcoin has seen significant fluctuations. It ranged from about $60,000 to less than $20,000 in the past year of trading. It is difficult for miners to determine if the potential benefit of their efforts is worth the significant expenditures involved when the crypto price fluctuates so wildly.\n\nRegulation. Many governments have met virtual currencies like Bitcoin with scepticism since any central bank or other governing body does not back them. Mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be outlawed by governments in the future, as happened in China in 2021, due to concerns over financial stability and increasing speculative trading.\n\nWhat Are Incentives For Bitcoin Miners?\n\nSince miners are greatly driven by the prospect of receiving free Bitcoins and transaction fees for their efforts, they verify transactions and solve the complex mathematical problem that underlies Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Miner Payment= Block Reward + Transaction Fees\n\nBitcoin miners have their payouts cut in half every four years. In 2009, when Bitcoin was originally mined, a single block could be mined for a reward of 50 BTC. This was reduced to 25 BTC in 2012, then cut in half again to 12.5 BTC by 2016. In 2020, the reward halved again to 6.25 BTC.\n\nBy 2040, the block reward will be down to less than 0.2 BTC, and just 80,000 BTC will be available for mining. Mining will truly end once the last Bitcoin is mined, somewhere around 2140.\n\nIs Bitcoin Mining Profitable?\n\nMining for bitcoins may appear to be lucrative, but is it? Bitcoin\u2019s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, designed the system so that the more influential the mining network, the harder it is to solve the mathematical issue. The whole network mining power is factored into the difficulty adjustment process.\n\nTo put it another way, if more miners join the fray, the difficulty of the challenge rises. This system was implemented to ensure continuity and a consistent stream of new Bitcoins to control inflation. With the current mining difficulty, a new block is generated around every 10 minutes.\n\nPeople are motivated to employ Bitcoin mining for substantial financial gain because of the rewards in the mining process itself. However, turning mining into a viable venture is sometimes a walk in the park. In light of this, it is essential to take into account and verify the following elements, all of which significantly affect mining profits:\n\nHash rate\n\nMining difficulty\n\nBlock rewards\n\nMining pool fees\n\nPower consumption expenses\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market price\n\nHow to Start Bitcoin Mining\n\nIf the benefits have convinced you to start mining, keep reading for a primer on getting set up to mine Bitcoin.\n\nSet Up Bitcoin Mining Hardware\n\nPick out the Bitcoin mining hardware to use first. You can use any computer, but you probably won\u2019t make any money unless you have a robust system built for Bitcoin mining. To cut costs, consider searching online for second-hand mining equipment.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that most mining rigs use the Linux OS and need a high level of computer expertise to set up and run. It\u2019s important to factor in more time for learning and fixing problems if you\u2019re unfamiliar with high-level computer systems.\n\nCreate a Dedicated Bitcoin Wallet\n\nYou\u2019ll need a working wallet if and when you validate a Bitcoin block. You need to set up a unique wallet to keep your cryptocurrency mining earnings apart from your other Bitcoin holdings.\n\nBitcoin wallets come in various ways, each with ease of use and security. If you\u2019re serious about protecting your Bitcoins, set up a hardware wallet, as it\u2019s the most secure type.\n\nConfigure Your Mining Equipment\n\nTo earn Bitcoins, you\u2019ll need to get mining gear, store your currency in a Bitcoin wallet, and set up your mining program. Like the previous step, this one calls for technical know-how if you want to enhance your Bitcoin mining capacity by joining various hardware miners.\n\nSome mining hardware has a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables the device to be configured using a mouse. Another sophisticated computer skill typically used by programmers and developers is familiarity with the command line, which is required to use some mining devices. Choose the Bitcoin mining program for your gear after carefully considering your needs.\n\nStart Bitcoin Mining Process\n\nOnce you have a local copy of the blockchain for the cryptocurrency you wish to mine, you may begin mining immediately. Your mining is now underway, and you may take a break. Your mining gear is what mines the cryptocurrency for you. You don\u2019t have to do anything more, but you should check in on your rig repeatedly to ensure it\u2019s still mining. Your mining hardware can mine cryptocurrency 24/7, even if you are at work or asleep.\n\nIs Bitcoin mining legal?\n\nConsidering the adoption by many countries, the answer to the question of whether Bitcoin mining is legal or not is yes. For example, Enigma (located in Iceland) developed one of the world\u2019s most massive Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nIn Israel, crypto mining is regarded as a commercial activity that must pay corporate income tax. On the other hand, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in the United States classifies cryptocurrency miners as money transmitters, which means they may be subject to the regulations governing such activity.\n\nFurther, El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele declared in November 2021 that a new \u201cBitcoin city\u201d will be constructed in the shape of a coin near the base of the Conchagua volcano. Geothermal energy will supply the city\u2019s Bitcoin mining operations. With the support of crypto infrastructure provider Blockstream, El Salvador plans to issue a billion-dollar \u201cBitcoin bond\u201d to fund the city\u2019s building.\n\nBut Bitcoin mining is illegal in Algeria, Nepal, Russia, Bolivia, Egypt, Morocco, Ecuador, and Pakistan. Find out if Bitcoin mining is legal where you reside by looking into the relevant local laws and regulations.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nHow long does it take to mine one Bitcoin?\n\nAbout once every 10 minutes, a new block is added to the Bitcoin blockchain, and with it comes the creation of one Bitcoin. Approximately 900 Bitcoins are mined each day, with the average amount of Bitcoins mined every block expected to decrease as more Bitcoins are distributed. Bitcoin blocks are generated around 144 times daily, each containing 6.25 newly produced Bitcoins. By that measure, a new Bitcoin is generated every 1.6 minutes.\n\nHow much does it cost to mine Bitcoin?\n\nMiners must constantly spend money on mining hardware, the internet, and energy. Investing in new mining hardware might consume thousands of dollars, depending on your needed tools. Power and data connection fees change based on factors including distance and consumption. Thus, Bitcoin mining may either bring in profits or cause losses.\n\nCan you get rich by crypto mining?\n\nDue to the high value of cryptocurrencies, mining has become highly competitive. Several coins might have been mined annually in the early days of crypto, but today\u2019s mining difficulty and competition mean that only large-scale mining operations can generate a profit. However, it is feasible to earn several hundred dollars monthly by mining bitcoins.\n\nHow do you mine Bitcoin without hardware?\n\nCloud miners use the services of a cloud provider to mine Bitcoin without needing specialised mining hardware. Cloud miners forgo the upfront expense of mining gear in favour of a subscription fee charged by the cloud mining service provider.\n\nIs Bitcoin Mining Right for You?\n\nPeople often view Bitcoin mining as a lucrative business opportunity. It\u2019s important to remember that Bitcoin mining is not a get-rich-quick scheme and requires a high level of technical expertise and sophisticated hardware. Massive expenditures in costly technology, along with plenty of computing power, dependable connectivity to the internet, and plenty of energy, are also needed. Therefore, before committing significant funds, it is prudent to do your own research."
