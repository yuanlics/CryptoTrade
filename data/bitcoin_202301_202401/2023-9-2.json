        "title": "Two years of bitcoin in Bukele\u2019s El Salvador: An opaque experiment with a little-used currency - EL PA\u00cdS USA",
        "content": "Two years ago, El Salvador stunned the world by becoming the first country to make bitcoin an official currency. Journalists from around the world traveled to the Central American nation of 6.3 million people, known for its beaches and its diaspora in the United States, to document the new monetary reality. September 7, 2021, when the new cryptocurrency law came into effect, was an atypical moment in which a small country briefly held the attention of the entire world.\n\nInterest has waned, but the experiment continues. It is tempting to classify the Bitcoin Law \u2014 the name for the legislative project that made the digital asset legal tender \u2014 as a success or a failure. But nothing is so simple in President Nayib Bukele\u2019s El Salvador. The country\u2019s decision to make bitcoin an official currency is difficult to analyze because it is an opaque experiment with several different objectives: financial inclusion, revenue for the public treasury and building the reputation of the president.\n\nThe experiment began with several bitcoin purchases by the Bukele government. The exact amount of bitcoin that El Salvador has in its international reserves is not known, since the government does not keep a public record. The closest thing that exists to a purchase announcement are Bukele\u2019s brief posts on social media. The website nayibtracker.com maintains its own account and estimates that El Salvador has lost 37% of the value of its investments in bitcoin, since the cryptocurrency began to fall in 2021. That\u2019s the equivalent of $45 million. It is estimated that El Salvador currently has $76.5 million worth of bitcoin. As often happens in the crypto world, the website does not include information about the bitcoin owners or who manages the assets.\n\nA protest against bitcoin in El Salvador on June 1. Alex Pe\u00f1a (Getty Images)\n\nWhen introducing the currency to the population, the idea was that it be used in all types of transactions: from buying street food to a property. With this goal in mind, the government opened a digital wallet called Chivo, and gave every citizen the equivalent of $30 in bitcoin. But hundreds of the Chivo accounts were hacked, and the money was stolen along with the account owner\u2019s identity.\n\nThis perhaps scared many in El Salvador. One of the benefits of cryptocurrencies is the speed with which remittances can be sent from abroad \u2014 an advantage that was promoted by the Salvadoran government. But so far this year, only 1.3% of remittances have been transferred using digital wallets that use cryptocurrencies, according to the most recent data from the central bank. In comparison, 4% of remittances sent to Mexico are made through cryptocurrencies, according to the specialized firm Chainalysis.\n\nLast week, an investment research firm called Ark Invest made waves on social media when it published a report claiming that bitcoin adoption in Argentina surpasses that of El Salvador. \u201cUnderstandably, the citizens of El Salvador prefer to transact in USD, which became legal tender in El Salvador in 2001 and has protected purchasing power from the inflation and devaluations that have ravaged other countries in the region,\u201d stated the report signed by analyst David Puell. \u201cIn contrast, the price of bitcoin has been quite volatile in the face of growing pains as it endeavors to evolve into a monetary system with increased liquidity and global adoption.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis news makes a lot of sense,\u201d said M\u00f3nica Taher, vice president at RocketFuel, a global cryptocurrency payment processing company. Until October, Taher was the director of technology and innovation for the Bukele government\u2019s business promotion agency, InvestSV. In addition to the size difference between Argentina and El Salvador, a cluster of technology companies has been growing organically in Argentina for at least two decades, and today are industry leaders, explains Taher.\n\nDuring her time in the government, she was in charge of attracting and guiding companies interested in operating in El Salvador. \u201cAn avalanche of companies came \u2014 we didn\u2019t know what to do with them all,\u201d recalls the former official. \u201cEveryone was excited, especially the first year, and it was very nice to see a kind of reverse migration: it wasn\u2019t the Salvadorans who were migrating to the United States, now it was foreigners from every country in the world there were who decided to move.\u201d\n\nSeeing the interest of companies in El Salvador, the Central African Republic announced in April 2022 that it would make bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies legal tender. But their experiment failed, and less than a year later Congress reversed the legislation.\n\n\u201cThe goal, for me, of using bitcoin in El Salvador is to increase people\u2019s economic freedom so that there are no intermediaries and, within that, to empower women to control their own finances,\u201d said Taher. But \u201cif there is no coherent educational process, mass adoption will take a long time in the country,\u201d she warned.\n\nA few months ago, the Bukele government granted Bitfinix \u2014 a company founded in Hong Kong in 2012 \u2014 the country\u2019s first license for digital assets, such as equities and bonds. Bitfinix and its sister company, Thether, had to stop operating in New York in February 2021, when the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office declared that they \u201crecklessly and unlawfully covered-up\u201d losses of $850 million. A few months later, U.S. regulators fined Tether Holdings $41 million for making untrue or misleading statements by claiming that its token was a stablecoin, with its value pegged to a fiat currency.\n\nThe move to bitcoin has been an undeniable success for El Salvador, says Andr\u00e9s Engler, a journalist specialized in cryptocurrencies and former editor for Latin America of the crypto website Coindesk. \u201cIn terms of press, it put Bukele in the headlines,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is indisputable. With respect to the crypto industry, El Salvador today is a strong figure. If you ask anyone in the industry about El Salvador, they will recognize it and will probably name Bukele straight away. From that point of view, it seems to have been effective.\u201d\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition"

        "title": "Bitcoin flat below US$26,000 as rate hike woes cool down - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin edged up on Monday morning in Asia but remained below the US$26,000 resistance level, giving up much of last week\u2019s gains from a favorable court ruling on Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund application. Ether also stayed range-bound at around US$1,650, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with XRP leading the winners and Dogecoin the losers. U.S. stock futures edged down Monday morning after Wall Street closed the week higher on a cool-off in the U.S. labor market that soothed the concerns for more interest rate hikes.\n\nBitcoin gave up gains from Grayscale\u2019s victory\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.30% in the last 24 hours to US$25,958.25 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong and traded 0.46% lower for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency lost control of the US$26,000 support level on Friday and fluctuated around the mark over the weekend.\n\nBitcoin briefly reached a weekly high of over US$28,000 last Tuesday on a court ruling that required the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to review asset manager Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin ETF application, but soon gave up all the gains after the SEC delayed all pending ETF applications on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhile investors might be looking at the Grayscale v. SEC developments, it feels like the recent price action is linked to activity from the FTX wallets, igniting fear of a potential dump as some (or all) of these assets would be liquidated into fiat for expenses, repaying investors,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\nA Solana-based cold wallet owned by collapsed crypto exchange FTX transferred over US$10 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including LINK, SUSHI, LUNA and YFI, to Ethereum addresses from Aug. 31 to Sept. 2, according to Arkham Intelligence data cited by blockchain journalist Colin Wu.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ether\u2019s prices are below their 50-day moving averages of US$28,299 and US$1,789, indicating bearishness in the prices, Markus Thielen, head of research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in a Monday report by Matrixport.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the past month, the world\u2019s leading stablecoin USDT has lost US$1 billion in market cap and consistently traded below the 1:1 peg with U.S. dollars, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\n\u201cThe decline in (USDT) market cap was first associated with a move into Bitcoin on August 8 when US$400 million was moved from USDT into BTC. But then another US$500 million appeared to have been redeemed when Bitcoin prices crashed around August 18. Liquidity leaving the ecosystem, is always negative,\u201d said Thielen.\n\nEther inched 0.17% higher to US$1,635.19 and was down 1.27% over the past seven days.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours and moved no higher than 1%. The exception was XRP, which led the winners by gaining 1.07% in the past 24 hours to US$0.5048, but remained 3.46% lower for the week.\n\nDogecoin led the losers, dropping 0.62% in the past 24 hours to US$0.06315 and stayed flat for the seven-day period.\n\nToncoin, the native token of Ton network, surged 23.86% in the past week, boosted by the network\u2019s launch of its new smart contract programming language Tact on August 22.\n\nTON stands for \u201cThe Open Network,\u201d a layer-1 blockchain originally developed by messaging service provider Telegram that withdrew from the project in 2020. TON launched the beta of its own crypto wallet service TON Space on August 10, which was integrated into the Telegram application at the very start.\n\n\u201cWith Telegram boasting a user base of 700 million, the platform presents a substantial opportunity for the distribution and onboarding of new users into the Toncoin ecosystem,\u201d said John Stefanidis, chief executive officer and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure foundation Balthazar DAO.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.09% to US$1.04 trillion. Trading volume dropped 10.77% to US$19.78 billion.\n\nU.S. stock futures flat after Wall Street booked weekly gains\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nMain stock indexes across Asia went higher on Monday morning, as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong kong. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, Japan\u2019s Nikkei and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all logged gains.\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading mixed with Dow futures and S&P 500 futures inching down while Nasdaq futures were edging higher. Wall Street closed varied at the end of regular session trading Friday, but all three major U.S. indexes booked weekly gains as Friday\u2019s labor market data eased rate hike worries. The U.S. stock market closes this Monday and will open on Tuesday,\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate rose to 3.8% in August, the highest reading since February 2022, according to the Labor Department on Friday, which could mitigate the concerns about further increases in the U.S. interest rates.\n\nGiven the uptick in unemployment rate, moderated job gains and wage growth, as well as an increase in labor force participation, \u201cthe U.S. August jobs report increases the probability that the highly data-dependent Fed will not hike again in this cycle,\u201d Mohamed A. El-Erian, an adviser to Germany-based financial services firm Allianz, tweeted on Friday.\n\nAdding to the optimistic outlook of the U.S. central bank\u2019s battle against inflation, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic said on Thursday that \u201cinflation is conclusively on track toward 2% over a reasonable time frame,\u201d and that the Fed\u2019s monetary policy \u201cis already restrictive enough to get us there.\u201d\n\nThe Fed raised its interest rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% in July, the highest level in 22 years. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said following July\u2019s meeting that the central bank will take a \u201cdata-dependent\u201d approach when deciding how to reduce the country\u2019s annual inflation below its long-term goal of 2%.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 93% chance the Fed will maintain the current rate at its next meeting on September 20, up from 88% on Friday.\n\nInformation to notice in the week ahead includes the S&P\u2019s August U.S. services purchasing manager index (PMI) on Wednesday, as well as a series of Fed official speeches on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index logged its biggest weekly gains in over a month last Friday, as the country ramped up the policy supports for its ailing post-Covid economic recovery, according to Reuters on Monday. China\u2019s economic revival kit includes alleviating home-purchase restrictions in an attempt to stablize its wavering property market, as well as the country\u2019s top banks paving ways for more interest rate cuts.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "Members of the Sinaloa Cartel prepare capsules with methamphetamine in a safe house in Culiacan, Mexico, April 4, 2022. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini\n\nWhat\u2019s the context? Crypto is being used for money laundering and to sell drugs online, posing a tough challenge for police fighting organized crime\n\nCryptocurrency use growing among drug traffickers\n\nBitcoin the most common payment in online drug sales\n\nMany law enforcement agencies lack crypto literacy BOGOTA/MEXICO CITY - For decades, drug traffickers carried their cash in suitcases to dodge banking controls, and the police. Today, many are also using virtual cryptocurrency wallets installed on their cellphones. When the U.S. Justice Department announced charges in April against four sons of jailed Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, the indictment said they had used \"untraceable cryptocurrency\" to launder the profits of their U.S. fentanyl smuggling operation. Known as the \"Chapitos\", the leaders of the Sinaloa cartel are accused of procuring chemicals from China to manufacture fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, in clandestine labs in Mexico for distribution in the United States. On the same day in April, U.S. authorities also announced the arrest in Guatemala of a wanted money launderer who they say worked for the cartel, accusing him of collecting $869,000 in drug profits and depositing the cash in cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nThe cases highlight how drug cartels and crime gangs in Latin America have taken up virtual currencies to launder money, receive payments and sell drugs on the darknet because law enforcement authorities are finding it harder to detect the deals, researchers and officials say. \"The technology is basically getting better and better which is making it even more difficult for law enforcement to go after these bad actors because this process provides and allows for anonymity,\" said Gretta Goodwin, a director in the Homeland Security and Justice team at the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), a congressional watchdog. Criminals use cryptocurrencies because it is an easy and efficient way to do business, particularly across borders, said Kim Grauer, a data scientist and cryptocurrency researcher. \"Cryptocurrency is really just used because it's a fast and instantaneous payment,\" said Grauer, head of research at Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics firm. \"We are seeing a lot more cases popping up,\" she said. Cracks in regulation It is a trend organised crime groups in Brazil and Central America are also tapping into, according to a report published in the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs in March. The MS-13 criminal gang that operates in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala has been using bitcoin as a way for victims to hand over extortion payments and as payment for transporting cocaine to Mexico, the report found. It said organised crime groups are \"discovering growing cracks in the regional anti-money laundering architecture that make the switch to cryptocurrencies increasingly attractive.\" The report's co-author Douglas Farah said using cryptocurrency for laundering drug money was easier in countries with lax crypto regulation or where bitcoin is classified as a legal tender, such as El Salvador. \"Dollars can come in and out of bitcoin with no traceability ... there's zero control on bitcoin transactions, but there's no monitoring, no attempt to do anything about it,\" said Farah, who heads IBI Consultants, a U.S.-based security consulting firm, in reference to El Salvador.\n\nRepresentations of cryptocurrency exchange Binance and hard drugs are seen in this illustration taken, May 23, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Representations of cryptocurrency exchange Binance and hard drugs are seen in this illustration taken, May 23, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nTo move money through cryptocurrency platforms, criminals are taking advantage of unregulated exchanges that do not require proof of identification or registration information, said crypto intelligence company CipherTrace. In Mexico, to stop transactions being detected by authorities - who require registered cryptocurrency trading platforms to report transfers above 56,000 pesos ($3,300) - criminals buy and launder small amounts of bitcoin, found a 2021 report by the International Narcotics Control Board. Criminals operating in Latin America also hire the services of \"tumblers\" who, in exchange for a commission, mix identifiable crypto with illegal funds to make them harder to trace, according to CipherTrace. Yet most countries in the region have not updated their anti-money laundering regulations to include cryptocurrencies, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Countries with few or no compliance requirements around money laundering are proving attractive for criminals using cryptocurrency, said Goodwin from the GAO. \"They can use that to evade detection and identification by law enforcement, and we found that to be a major challenge,\" she said. 'No frontiers' The adoption of cryptocurrency in the narcotics trade also goes hand-in-hand with the rise of drug sales on the darknet - a hidden part of the internet, according to a 2021 UNODC report. It said Latin America and the Caribbean have experienced a \"sustained growth\" in the online trafficking of synthetic drugs and opioids, mostly using bitcoin - the first cryptocurrency to enter the market in 2009. In May, U.S. authorities said \"Operation SpecTor,\" which spanned three continents and aimed to disrupt fentanyl and opioid trafficking on the dark web, resulted in the seizure of $53.4 million in cash and cryptocurrencies. Drug traffickers have taken advantage of more people being online, and they also advertise drugs on dating sites and apps, such as Grindr and Tinder, the UNODC report says. Once sellers and buyers connect, communications tend to move to encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram. It is a trend that increased during the COVID-19 pandemic when online platforms selling drugs grew as people were stuck at home, said Mariana Kiefer, UNODC's cybercrime Regional Coordinator for South America. \"Most online activities involved in drug trafficking are through cryptocurrencies. This is appealing to drug traffickers as they can reach more people online. The internet has no frontiers,\" said Kiefer. Crypto literate? Many virtual currency transactions are permanently recorded on public blockchains, which show all transactions between wallets, meaning police and researchers can trace transactions provided they have the right tools, software and expertise. In a 2021 study, Chainalysis was able to identify cryptocurrency addresses associated with suspected China-based fentanyl precursor sellers. It found the addresses had received more than $37.8 million worth of cryptocurrency since 2018.\n\nA breakthrough often hinges on whether it is possible to access the right cryptocurrency address that has received a payment allowing researchers to follow the money. \"We are making progress in how we are identifying these cryptocurrency addresses ... once you do, your world blows up with cryptocurrency because you have every single transaction that that address is ever associated with,\" said Grauer. But a key challenge is ensuring U.S. law enforcement and drug agencies are literate in cryptocurrencies so they understand \"what they are actually looking at,\" to build an investigation from complex databases, she said. U.S. law enforcement agencies are partnering with other experts to trace cryptocurrency payments as criminals adapt and use new technology to avoid detection, said Goodwin. \"It requires really sophisticated computer software programs, and some of the law enforcement agencies don't really have the in-house expertise that they would need,\" she said.

In addition to declaring it legal tender and investing in Bitcoin mining, the country now allows Bitcoin to serve as collateral for mortgages.\n\nTwo major banks in El Salvador, Cuscatlan and Agricola, have announced that they will now accept Bitcoin for loan payments. Customers can use Bitcoin to settle credit card debts or loans directly, eliminating the need for fiat conversion. This groundbreaking move was revealed through a tweet by Volcano Energy, a key player in El Salvador's emerging crypto landscape.\n\nThe announcement aligns with El Salvador\u2019s broader strategy to integrate cryptocurrency into its financial infrastructure. This is not just another step for Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador, but a significant move that could set precedents for the banking industry globally.\n\nLegal Tender and Bitcoin Mining\n\nIn a landmark decision that garnered international attention, as reported by Blockchain.News, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele announced in June 2021 that the nation would be the first to make Bitcoin legal tender. Prior to this, Bitcoin had largely been regarded as a speculative asset, notorious for its price volatility.\n\non June, 2023, Volcano Energy, known for its renewable energy ventures, appears to be broadening its ecosystem to financial services that facilitate cryptocurrency transactions. The company has previously announced a $1 billion investment in a Bitcoin mining startup. This was part of a renewable energy initiative backed by Tether , aimed at making El Salvador a global hub for sustainable Bitcoin mining.\n\nWhile the announcement focuses on financial transactions, the sustainability angle offered by Volcano Energy shouldn\u2019t be ignored. El Salvador is already utilizing renewable resources for Bitcoin mining, and the same sustainable approach could be adopted for transactional services. As the nation attempts to make its financial system more resilient and self-reliant, sustainability may serve as a cornerstone.\n\nRegulatory and Financial Implications\n\nEl Salvador has been a forerunner in cryptocurrency adoption since it made Bitcoin legal tender in September 2021. However, this announcement from Cuscatlan and Agricola Banks, facilitated through Volcano Energy, could have far-reaching implications. It is yet to be seen how international bodies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and even US Federal Reserve will respond to El Salvador's banks incorporating Bitcoin payments for loans and credit cards.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nAs cryptocurrency becomes increasingly integrated into El Salvador's financial and energy sectors, the acceptance of Bitcoin by Cuscatlan and Agricola Banks marks a significant stride. This could pave the way for broader financial inclusivity and innovations in banking transactions, powered by renewable energy and blockchain technology. While it is too early to predict the full impact of this development, it surely positions El Salvador as a testbed for a new form of banking that incorporates cryptocurrencies.\n\nImage source: Shutterstock"

        "content": "Share:\n\nPopular strategy analyst Benjamin Cowen has forecasted a bearish month for Bitcoin this September.\n\nIn his opinion, the month has proven gloomy for BTC historically, characterized by negative averages incomparable to any other month.\n\nWith this, Cowen predicts a 10% slump to test the $23,000 psychological level.\n\nRegarding altcoins, he anticipates a recovery inspired by a confluence of macro tailwinds to steer the market into 2024.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has historically hurt traders that take long positions in September, with strategy analyst Benjamin Cowen predicting double-digit losses this month, potentially testing levels last seen in February.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Weekly Forecast: BTC correlation to DJIA hits 2021 peak levels amid ETF hype.\n\nBitcoin could fall 10% in September\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price could fall at least 10% in September, according to Cowen, a strategy analyst who explored the bearish outlook displayed by BTC historically during this month. With the flagship crypto back in the $25,000 range after the US Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) delayed decisions on spot BTC Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) filing, the analyst says:\n\nSeptember just tends to not be a great month for crypto. Bitcoin \u2013 you can see \u2013 it averages negative in September, by a long shot, much worse than any other month.\n\nThe analyst retraced the \u201cseasonality of Bitcoin,\u201d highlighting that momentum indicators add credence to his analysis. In his opinion, the fact that BTC closed the month of August below the $27,000 psychological level increased the odds for a deep correction to $23,000 in September.\n\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart\n\nWhat about altcoins?\n\nRegarding altcoins, the analyst predicts this class of assets \u201ccoming back to life,\u201d possibly driven by a confluence of macro factors that would bode well for the altcoin category in 2024.\n\nCowen\u2019s thesis for altcoins in 2024 sprouts from the Bitcoin halving, expected in early 2024. The halving season is characterized by volatility, which could go higher considering the US Elections, defined by massive market uncertainty. For one, incumbents looking to stay in power are likely to inject political pressure as a campaign strategy to entice voters with less stringent monetary policies, hence volatility.\n\nThe analyst also bases his postulate on the ongoing \u201crate-hikes,\u201d with the Federal Reserve showing more aggression this cycle than ever.\n\n\u2026at this rate, we are likely to start seeing the labor market show noticeable effects from all these interest rate hikes by the end of this year, early next year.\n\nA weakening labor market coupled with easing inflation as chatter about a recession lingers will likely influence the Fed to pause the rate hikes to help companies stay afloat. This could pave the way for a \u201cquantitative easing return\u201d in the market, possibly allowing altcoins to thrive."

        "title": "Real Bedford \u2014 Bitcoin, football and the bear market - Forkast News",
        "content": "The team in bright orange, a skull and crossbones on their chests, walked onto the field of play, their anthem \u2014 \u201cKnow Your Enemy\u201d by U.S. rap metal band Rage Against the Machine \u2014 drowning out the cheers of the 150 or so fans in attendance.\n\nIt was a suitably rock-n-roll start to a first round cup game for Real Bedford, the world\u2019s first Bitcoin-funded football team. The club, based in Bedford, a market town with a population of 170,000 in Bedfordshire, England, is the passion project of local owner and Bitcoin evangelist Peter McCormack.\n\nThe host of the \u201cWhat Bitcoin Did\u201d podcast \u2014 a Bitcoin-based current affairs show that positions the cryptocurrency as a remedy for socioeconomic issues such as rising inflation and state debt \u2014 spoke animatedly on the day of the match about the changes the club has seen under his ownership, and the role that Bitcoin has played in it.\n\n\u201cTeams should care about something,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery club has a history of where it came from. It\u2019s usually the community they were in.\u201d His ownership has brought with it the international reach and decentralized philosophy of Bitcoin \u2014 a \u201cglobal community that cares about hard working people not having the fruits of their labor debased by government mismanagement of money,\u201d he added.\n\nBut financial reliance on a cryptocurrency brings with it certain complications \u2014 including market volatility and industry implosions beyond the Real Bedford owner\u2019s control.\n\nBear market\n\nMcCormack completed the purchase of Real Bedford \u2014 a South Midlands Division One side then known as Bedford FC \u2014 in April 2022 on the back of various business ventures linked to Bitcoin. He said at the time of the takeover that, with Bitcoin-backed financing, he wants to put the club in a position to rise nine tiers to the Premier League \u2014 the pinnacle of English football.\n\n3/ So what is the plan? To get our club into the Premier League, 9 promotions\u2026\n\n\u2026I am a bitcoiner, we aim big. If we can separate money and state, we can get a football club into the Premier League. pic.twitter.com/uQu4i0l90v \u2014 Peter McCormack\ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f (@PeterMcCormack) December 16, 2021\n\nHe started the process of buying the club in December 2021, near the peak of the last crypto bull market. But in March 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. Then in May that year, stablecoin platform Terra-Luna collapsed, followed by the FTX cryptocurrency exchange in November. A bear market mentality settled over the crypto industry as investors shied away from riskier assets, including Bitcoin. Prices dropped, while over US$2 trillion was wiped off the wider market.\n\nFrom a high of almost US$70,000, Bitcoin\u2019s price plummeted to less than US$16,000 by the end of 2022. While it recovered some of that ground to trade within the US$26,000 range as of early September, analysts expect macroeconomic concerns to continue to weigh on the token\u2019s price \u2014 at least in the short term.\n\n\u201cThe main headwind for crypto is rising real interest rates,\u201d said Samuel Lee, founder of U.S.-based SVRN Asset Management, an investment advisory firm. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll see a sustained resurgence until interest rates drop back down again and people forget about the trauma and folly of the last bubble.\u201d\n\nCould an extended period of crypto winter combined with further declines in the price of Bitcoin impact Real Bedford?\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t worry me because I fundamentally believe there\u2019s a far higher chance of the pound failing than Bitcoin,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cI think a more important question is: is the club sustainable if we don\u2019t keep winning?\u201d\n\nLocal link\n\nAs the referee blew his whistle for the start of last week\u2019s game at McMullen Park, the realities of ninth-tier English football set in. With the music off, the fans quietened down, their cheers replaced by the sound of the wind blowing through the trees lining the ground and a motorway running opposite. It was a long way from the glamor of the Premier League.\n\n\u201cBedford isn\u2019t really known for anything,\u201d said McCormack, 44, who has lived in the town most of his life. \u201cIf a tourist comes to the U.K., most people go to London or Manchester or Bath. There\u2019s no reason to come to Bedford.\u201d\n\nMark Anderson, a local software engineer who volunteers at the club on Saturdays, was more direct. \u201cBedfordshire is basically the arse-end of the nice bits,\u201d he said, referring to the county\u2019s location north of Greater London on the periphery of some of Britain\u2019s most desirable real estate.\n\nBut it is McCormack\u2019s connection to the local area, the Real Bedford owner said, that gives him an advantage over other sporting ownership models backed by digital assets.\n\n\u201cThis has meaning to me because it\u2019s my town,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most important thing I\u2019m doing. The town of Bedford should have a team in the Football League.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to fourth-tier English football team Crawley Town \u2014 bought by U.S. crypto consortium WAGMI United in April 2022 \u2014 as an example of an ownership model without a link to the local community. WAGMI, like McCormack, promised to take the club to the pinnacle of English football. But rather than Bitcoin, they planned to use sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to build Crawley\u2019s brand and establish an international fan base.\n\nThe project got off to a promising start, earning \u00a33.5 million (US$4.4 million) from its first NFT drop. But against the backdrop of last year\u2019s turbulence in the crypto market, the new owners became increasingly involved in day-to-day footballing operations \u2014 including a brief stint on the coach\u2019s bench for co-owner Preston Johnson. The club went into a tailspin, suffering its worst finish in twelve years in the football league and narrowly avoiding relegation.\n\nWhile WAGMI United didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, Reuben Watt, Chair of the Crawley Town Supporters Alliance, said that by the end of last season, confidence in the group\u2019s ownership was at an \u201call-time low.\u201d He worried that the owners had consistently focused on pleasing NFT holders over local fans.\n\nConcern among fans appears to have sunk in. WAGMI appointed Sam Jordan, a member of the Supporter\u2019s Alliance, to the board of directors in August.\n\n\u201cI think the appointment of Sam to the club\u2019s board is a huge turning point for the club,\u201d said Watt. \u201cHad WAGMI got in someone with knowledge of English football straight away and put a fan on the board, then we would\u2019ve been in a better situation.\u201d\n\nMcCormack didn\u2019t hold back in his criticism of the Crawley owners. \u201cI think they bought it as a toy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey bought a toy under the hype, probably watched a bunch of Ted Lasso and got excited. They\u2019ve done a terrible job.\u201d\n\nHe also identified issues with the WAGMI group\u2019s association with crypto assets like meme coins and NFTs \u2014 which are fundamentally different, he said, to Bitcoin \u2014 as another flaw in its business model.\n\n\u201cThey basically want to just get people to buy crap that will lose value \u2014 which has been proven historically \u2014 whereas for us, Bitcoin is a monetary asset,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis war we see between Bitcoin and crypto is reflected in the ethos of how we run our clubs. Bitcoin is in our DNA, but we\u2019re also about building that feeling around the town that this is a community thing,\u201d he added.\n\nBitcoin backers\n\nLast season, Real Bedford won its division at a canter, earning promotion to the South Midlands Premier Division. Much of the financing behind that run came from large-scale sponsorship. The club has partnership agreements with a host of Bitcoin companies, including Iris Energy, a sustainable Bitcoin mining firm; Galaxy, a crypto firm dealing in corporate finance; and Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nAccording to the club\u2019s records, sponsorship provided \u00a3387,900 (US$491,000) out of the club\u2019s \u00a3549,507 (US$696,000) revenue in the 22/23 season \u2014 a significant amount given that ninth-tier clubs typically only have sponsorship deals in the four to five figure range.\n\nThe revenue brought in through tie-ups with the likes of Gemini \u2014 who, according to a spokesperson, view the Real Bedford partnership as a form of Bitcoin-backed community building \u2014 allows the club to make improvements to its facilities and player welfare in a way unmatched by the league\u2019s other teams.\n\nAnd while the sponsorship revenue gives the club a huge advantage in its ability to attract players, the Bitcoin connection also acts as a magnet for attracting supporters from further afield \u2014 football fans who may not otherwise have chosen Bedford as a place to spend their Saturday afternoons.\n\n\u201cOver the last year, over 100 people have come in from other countries to watch the games here,\u201d McCormack says. \u201cWe had 12 come in from Slovakia! That\u2019s insane! And they\u2019re spending money in the hotels, in the bars, in the restaurants \u2014 that money supports our local economy.\u201d\n\nThe 256% rise in matchday attendances since the takeover has put a strain on facilities unready for the increased level of interest. The club were averaging just 40 attendees per week when McCormack took over, whereas CEO Emma Firman wrote in the week\u2019s program notes that the club is now working with local businesses to expand its designated parking for the game.\n\n\u201cOur match days are getting busier, which is exciting for everyone here at the club as more people recognise our exciting project at McMullen Park,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSustainable growth\n\nBut for all the club\u2019s progress, the club\u2019s ownership model is reliant on Bitcoin-affiliated sponsors impacted by the ongoing bear market.\n\nThe club still sits five rungs below McCormack\u2019s medium-term target of the Football League \u2014 tiers 2 to 4 \u2014 where budgets of newly promoted sides are \u00a31-3 million. Getting there will require sustained success for the next half-decade \u2014 not just for the team, but for Bitcoin-backed sponsors who will have to weather any further market volatility and declines in the token\u2019s price.\n\nCompanies across the sector have been forced to push through large-scale layoffs over the past year, with Real Bedford\u2019s main sponsor Gemini undergoing three consecutive rounds of job cuts between July 2022 and January 2023. Their spending on TV and digital advertisements alone fell from US$3.8 million to US$478,000 between May and November 2022, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cCrypto sponsor\u2019s rich marketing budgets depended on the huge crypto bubble that allowed them to raise money effortlessly,\u201d said SVRN\u2019s Samuel Lee.\n\n\u201cWith the collapse in crypto prices and waning interest in crypto, money is unsurprisingly tight. I think crypto companies are starting to realize that the payoff for expensive sports sponsorships isn\u2019t as high as they thought,\u201d Lee added.\n\nMcCormack said that he personally has little concern for a Bitcoin price drop. The U.K. economy and the pound are more vulnerable to volatility in light of the government\u2019s debt burden, he said. But he did stress the importance of achieving stability beyond a reliance on Real Bedford\u2019s Bitcoin backers.\n\nOne way to do that, he said, is by growing crowds through a brand of football fans can engage with. That starts with the club\u2019s skull-heavy rebrand as The Pirates and a ramped up social media presence that leans heavily into the idea of the world\u2019s first Bitcoin-backed team as rock-n-roll disruptors.\n\n\u201cYou give people a brand of football they can support,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cWe have skulls. Skulls are f\u2013king cool. We play heavy metal when they come on the pitch. And have you seen our tunnel?\u201d\n\nBitcoin in the community\n\nThe team\u2019s brand also involves strong connections with the local area, not just through the men\u2019s team, but through community initiatives, youth and women\u2019s football. The recent FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand drew record global audiences and McCormack said he sees potential for women\u2019s football as a growth market for Real Bedford.\n\nThe club began its expansion in this area by completing a merger with Bedford Ladies and Girls FC in June. McCormack has raised the budget for the women\u2019s team, and is aiming for commercial parity with the men\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a commercial reason to do that because the town will recognize it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might come and watch, or bring their daughters to come and watch. Some people might say, \u2018oh, that\u2019s so woke\u2019 or whatever. But no, it\u2019s a commercially astute decision.\u201d\n\nMcCormack\u2019s emphasis on community building signposts a potential route for the club through the crypto winter and continuing Bitcoin bear market.\n\nUnlike Crawley, where the division between crypto backers and footballing matters has dissolved to the detriment of the club, McCormack maintains that a solid distance is kept between Real Bedford\u2019s Bitcoin financing and the team.\n\n\u201cIf you just want to come for the football, you can just have a full football experience and not have [Bitcoin] forced down your throat,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cThere\u2019s even an article on our website that says why you should not buy Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIn the short term at least, Real Bedford\u2019s focus is on growing the crowds and their fan base. And that means continuing to win, regardless of where the financing comes from.\n\n\u201cThe team\u2019s job is not to care about Bitcoin; the manager\u2019s job is not to care about Bitcoin, their job is to win games,\u201d McCormack said.\n\nAt last week\u2019s game, everyone played their parts to perfection.\n\nREAL BEDFORD 9 \u2013 1 ROTHWELL CORINTHIANS."

A bullish revival, involving a reclaim of $26,000 and continuation for a Q4 higher low, was \u201cless likely,\u201d Skew predicted.\n\nBitcoin \u201cbearadise\u201d threat remains\n\nSummarizing last week\u2019s events, Keith Alan, co-founder of monitoring resource Material Indicators, cautioned over categorical pronouncements on how bullish or bearish Bitcoin really is.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin lines up RSI showdown as BTC price slips toward new 2-week low\n\nVolatility up and down, respectively, had come from Grayscale\u2019s legal victory over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), followed by the latter\u2019s delaying a decision on the first U.S. Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nUnder the hood, however, Bitcoin market structure has not undergone any fundamental overhaul, Alan argued.\n\n\u201cOn the the first day of the September Monthly candle volatility continues as traders who seem to have forgotten \u2018the trend is your friend\u2019 are clinging on to hopium and fighting over BS narratives that fit their bias,\u201d he wrote in part of an X post on Sep. 2.\n\n\u201cThe reality is NOTHING HAS CHANGED, because neither a breakout nor a breakdown has been technically confirmed or invalidated.\u201d\n\nRepeating an existing theory, Alan continued that $24,750 was the support zone to watch, with Bitcoin \u201cbearadise\u201d at risk of entering should it fail.\n\nAn accompanying chart showed the BTC/USD order book on Binance, with buy liquidity increasing immediately below spot price at the $24,750 zone of interest.\n\nBTC/USD order book data for Binance.

In August, the unemployment rate edged up to 3.8%, its highest level in over a year, contrary to economists\u2019 expectations of it remaining at 3.5%.\n\nAdditionally, average hourly earnings only increased by 4.3% year-over-year, falling short of economists\u2019 projected 4.4% increase as the economy continues to slow down and pricing pressures ease. While job growth in August exceeded expectations with the addition of 187,000 jobs, it\u2019s worth noting that the job numbers for June and July were revised down by a combined 110,000.\n\nGold, Silver Or Bitcoin: What Is The Best Hedge Against Inflation?

Bitcoin\u2019s dominance serves as an indicator of the strength or weakness of altcoins. In addition to that, it is important to note that the best investment decisions are often made when one feels the least confident about them. This seems to be the case right now.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth mentioning that Bitcoin dominance is not continuing its upward momentum, but rather declining.\n\nPseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital said on X about the imminent risk of Bitcoin breaking down from a bearish double top pattern. According to his analysis, if a sell-off event occurs with significant trading volume, it could potentially trigger the breakdown process.\n\n\"BTC is on the cusp of validating its double top formation. A breakout on seller volume and a convincing loss of ~$26,000 followed by turning it into new resistance would confirm the breakdown.\"\n\nRekt Capital notes that Bitcoin\u2019s current price action is reminiscent of its late 2021 pattern, when it experienced a breakdown from a double top formation, signaling the end of its previous bull market.In 2021, BTC formed two distinct tops, similar to a double top, before eventually reaching a third top at a lower high.\n\nCrypto Tony said before we will see Altcoins pump 100x or 200x in the next bull run, they will tend to lay dormant for a while after putting in lows, which he expects later this year. \u201cOur job is to identify the accumulation zones and get in before the next big moves begin.\u201d"
