        "title": "Bitcoin prices have doubled in 2023; highest point in nearly 18 months - The Associated Press",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Bitcoin is having another moment. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency soared to almost $35,000 this week, marking its highest point in nearly 18 months \u2014 and more than double the price seen at the start of 2023.\n\nThe cryptocurrency rocketed from just over $5,000 each during the start of the pandemic to nearly $68,000 in November 2021, according to FactSet, during an era of massive tech growth. Prices came back down to earth during an aggressive series of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve as it battled inflation, and then the collapse of one of the biggest companies in crypto, FTX.\n\nWhen 2023 began, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000 after losing more than 75% of its value. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers this year as inflation started to cool. And the collapse of prominent tech-focused banks actually led more investors to turn to crypto as they bailed out of positions in Silicon Valley start-ups and other more risky bets.\n\nNow, bitcoin is getting another boost on the prospects of creating a much larger pool of investors. Industry advocates say a new way to invest in bitcoin at spot prices, instead of futures, could make it easier for anyone to enter the cryptoverse while lowering some of the well-documented risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere\u2019s rising optimism about the possibility of bitcoin exchange-traded funds \u2014 a pooled investment security that can be bought and sold like stocks \u2014 potentially being launched.\n\nA green light from federal regulators hasn\u2019t arrived yet, but recent wins for some crypto fund managers with applications for bitcoin spot ETFs have improved odds for approval, perhaps in the coming months.\n\nThe District of Columbia Court of Appeals recently ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission to reconsider the ETF for Grayscale\u2019s bitcoin fund, for example, after the company sued the regulator last year for rejecting its application over concerns about investor protections and other issues. The SEC did not appeal the decision.\n\nEdward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda, also points to the listing of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which clears market trades, gaining attention online Monday. That may have contributed to this week\u2019s Bitcoin surge, he said.\n\nIShares Bitcoin Trust appeared to be temporarily removed Tuesday, but was back online as of Wednesday. In a statement to The Associated Press, a DTCC spokesperson noted that both active and potential ETF securities appear on this list. iShares was added back in August, the spokesperson said.\n\nSocial media chatter, as well as misinformation, can make notable impacts on crypto trading, Moya and others note. Kaiko Research points to a brief spike in the price of bitcoin last week, for example, after crypto news outlet Cointelegraph erroneously posted about the SEC approving iShares\u2019 spot bitcoin ETF on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. That post was soon retracted.\n\nStill, the most recent surge bitcoin goes beyond single developments or participants, Kaiko research analyst Riyad Carey notes \u2014 crediting \u201cmore of a broad market rally\u201d around spot bitcoin ETF prospects.\n\nDespite the recent excitement around bitcoin, crypto is still a risky bet. Experts like Moya call it \u201cthe most volatile asset class,\u201d pointing to wildly unpredictable fluctuations in value. In short, investors can lose money as quickly as they make it.\n\nThe collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX also \u201cleft a big scar\u201d on the public\u2019s confidence in the crypto industry and crushed retail investors, Moya said \u2014 noting that institutional money, like hedge funds, are behind the bulk of crypto investing today.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing interest is coming back into the space, but it\u2019s not the same as it was before,\u201d he said, adding that he\u2019s watching how future regulation unfolds.\n\nAnd a lot is uncertain. While the price of bitcoin \u2014 as well as the stocks of crypto players like Coinbase and MicroStrategy \u2014 has risen amid prospects of spot ETF approval, it\u2019s not clear if it will stay that way. A regulatory green light doesn\u2019t promise continued gains.\n\n\u201c(In the case of approval), are we going to see sustained interest? Are we going to see the trading volumes with this ETF? If it disappoints, then bitcoin\u2019s going to struggle,\u201d Moya said. \u201cI might be more short-term bullish until we get the actual confirmation.\u201d\n\nAs of around 12:30 p.m. ET Wednesday, the price of bitcoin stood at $34,789."

        "content": "Data: CoinGecko; Chart: Axios Visuals Bitcoin is tantalizingly close to breaking past its price from just before the terra usd stablecoin melted down in May 2022. Why it matters: It's a sign that the world's biggest cryptocurrency may have shaken off the bad news. And as the bellwether for the whole crypto industry \u2014 when bitcoin rises, every other coin and token tends to rise with it.\n\nBy the numbers: As of Thursday afternoon, bitcoin is trading at $34,122. It briefly touched $35,000 Monday on CoinGecko, but it has largely hovered just below.\n\nCoinGecko is putting its seven-day rise at 18.4%.\n\nTo recover from Terra, though, it will need to hold a level near $37,000 (where it stood just before Terra's collapse). It's not there yet.\n\nWhat's happening: The consensus is that people are anticipating a spot bitcoin ETF finally getting approved.\n\nGold ETFs coming in 2004 were a game changer for that asset's price, as Matt Hougan of Bitwise noted in a social media post.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"Rumors are flying since the appearance of BlackRock's bitcoin spot ETF ticker on a list at the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), including that the world's largest asset manager has already started purchasing bitcoin for the fund,\" Stefan Rust, CEO of data aggregator Truflation, said in a statement.\n\nYes, but: James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares, pointed in a recent blog post to more muted inflows of capital into bitcoin, compared to prior rounds of ETF excitement.\n\nGo deeper: Open interest in bitcoin derivatives are piling up\n\nEditors note: This story has been corrected to reflect the proper attribution of the inflows data."

        "content": "KEY TAKEAWAYS The bitcoin price crossed $35,000 for the first time since May 2022, as market speculators anticipate the impending approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S.\n\nMore than $250 million in bitcoin short positions were liquidated in the past three days.\n\nAccording to Deutsche Digital Assets Head of Research Andr\u00e9 Dragosch, a short squeeze was a key contributing factor to the recent bitcoin price spike.\n\nThe Bitcoin Dominance Index as calculated by TradingView, also reached 54.26%, which is its highest level since April 2021.\n\nAs bitcoin's dominance over the crypto market increases, a report from Kaiko indicates crypto asset delistings from exchanges are happening at the fastest rate in history.\n\nBitcoin's price briefly surged past the $35,000 mark this week and some analysts think that growing small-investor participation may bode well in the coming weeks, but the rise in the cryptocurrency hasn't helped the rest of the market.\n\nTrading related to the news of a potential approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) intensified, pushing up the price above $30,000 and squeezing shorts, according to Deutsche Digital Assets Head of Research Andr\u00e9 Dragosch. The short squeeze led to more than $250 million liquidation of short positions over the past three days, according to data from Coinglass.\n\nAt the same time, the Bitcoin Dominance Index (BDI)\u2014a measure of bitcoin's share of the overall crypto market\u2014reached heights not seen since April 2021.\n\nBitcoin Dominance Index at Highest Levels in Two Years\n\nWhile a rising bitcoin tends to lift all crypto assets, the rest of the market has not been able to keep up with bitcoin this week. In fact, this has been the trend for nearly a year, as the BDI has seen a steady increase since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. Today, BDI is about 54.4%\u2014 its highest level since April 2021.\n\nTradingView\n\nIndeed, the darlings of the previous crypto bull market have not fared well relative to bitcoin over the past year. For example, the native crypto asset of Ethereum, ether, is up only 14% in the past year as opposed to a roughly 66% gain for bitcoin.\n\nAt the same time, Bloomberg reported that crypto tokens are being delisted from exchanges at a rate never before seen in the industry's history, according to data from Kaiko. Nearly 3,500 crypto token delistings have either already taken place or are expected to take place in 2023, and Coinbase (COIN), which is currently being sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, is said to have delisted 80 trading pairs this month alone.\n\nSmall Investors Laying Groundwork For Bitcoin Bull Market?\n\nDragosch observed increased bitcoin wallet activity for both small and large invetsors, but there was one number that stood out. An increase in \"median value of transfer volumes on the Bitcoin blockchain\"\u2014an indicator of small-investor participation\u2014could hold some clues about the price direction for bitcoin.\n\n\"Small-investor participation is a necessary condition for a sustained bull market in crypto assets,\" Dragosch wrote.\n\n"

        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nBitcoin is a speculative investment but the returns on CDs are locked in from the start. Getty Images\n\nYou've likely heard of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. You may have even been enticed to buy some with hopes of striking it rich. Why not try to get in before the next spike? That move, however, could be a dangerous one.\n\nThe truth is that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly speculative assets with several significant hurdles to any real-world utility. Rather than throwing money into an emerging technology that may or may not be worth anything 10 years from now, you may be better with a CD to lock in today's impressive returns.\n\nOpen a CD now to lock in today's impressive returns.\n\nWhy you should cash in your bitcoin for a CD\n\nThe Federal Reserve has raised the target federal funds rate more than 10 times since early 2022. As a result, CDs are offering better returns than investors have seen in years. However, that's not the only reason you may want to ditch cryptocurrency and dive into a CD.\n\nCDs are stable while bitcoin is volatile\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile investments, meaning these assets see sporadic and unpredictable swings in value. When more people buy bitcoin, the price of the cryptocurrency rises and when more people sell it, the price falls. The problem here is that nearly any news can cause significant swings in either direction.\n\nOn the other hand, CDs are stable investments with predictable returns.\n\nWhen you purchase a CD, you're not purchasing some high-risk asset hoping you'll make money in the long run. Instead, you know the exact return the CD is going to generate when you buy it. That's because when you purchase one, you lock in whatever rate CDs might be paying on that day. That's good news in today's high interest rate environment.\n\nBring stability to your finances with a CD today.\n\nCDs are a more straightforward investment\n\nIt's important to form a detailed understanding of anything you invest in. That may be difficult when it comes to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin because they're complex technologies in an emerging market. The world likely doesn't even know about some of the challenges bitcoin may face if it is ever used as a mainstream currency.\n\nOn the other hand, CDs are a more straightforward, easy-to-understand, investment option.\n\nDoug Roller, investment advisor representative and owner of Crossroads Financial Group in Fort Wayne, Indiana, says, \"CDs are relatively simple and straightforward investments.\" He went on to explain that CDs \"don't require much active management or monitoring,\" making them easier to manage for the average investor than high-risk investments.\n\nCDs promote better saving habits\n\nCDs are also a great way to improve your saving skills. Roller says, \"CDs promote disciplined saving habits, as they often have penalties for early withdrawal.\" That's good news because early withdrawal penalties can \"discourage impulsive spending and help you stick to your savings goals.\"\n\nRather than promoting sound spending habits, bitcoin can require a riskier approach.\n\nIf you purchased bitcoin, you probably did so based on stories you've read, watched or heard about people who have made millions investing in cryptocurrencies. Your hope is that bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency you invested in makes another run for the top, turning a few thousand dollars into a few million. While that may or may not be possible, the returns on a CD are definitive, promoting better saving habits and less risky investor behavior.\n\nDon't accept the risk. Lock in today's impressive CD interest rates now.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIf you want to try your chances with bitcoin, do so cautiously. On the other hand, if you want to make real returns on your idle cash without having to worry about volatility, security, or other concerns, dive into CDs. Get started here today."

        "title": "Investing in Cryptocurrency ETFs: Bitcoin Futures vs. Ether Futures - Investopedia",
        "content": "Bitcoin and ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) enable retail and other investors exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding them. These ETFs offer shares in baskets of either Bitcoin or ether futures contracts.\n\nInvestors can buy shares of these ETFs on traditional stock exchanges\u2014a regulated and convenient, though indirect, way to speculate on the price moves of these cryptocurrencies.\n\nKey Takeaways Bitcoin and ether futures ETFs deliver exposure to the price of these cryptocurrencies by holding futures contracts that track their currency price.\n\nKey differences between Bitcoin and ether futures ETFs include the underlying blockchain technology, the specific purposes of each cryptocurrency, and the amount of liquidity.\n\nSeveral advantages of Bitcoin and ether futures ETFs include their accessibility, their place in regulation markets, portfolio diversification, and institutional adoption.\n\nKey disadvantages of Bitcoin and ether futures ETFs include their reliance on futures contracts, tracking errors, increased volatility, and lower liquidity.\n\nBitcoin and ether futures ETFs are different from spot ETFs, which directly own the underlying cryptocurrency.\n\nThe ETFs derive their value from the performance of bitcoin and ether futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and investors can have a stake in their price direction without holding the physical assets. These ETFs offer a more familiar investment product for traditional market participants.\n\nWhat Are Bitcoin Futures ETFs?\n\nBitcoin futures ETFs seek to track the performance of Bitcoin futures contracts traded on the CME. Importantly, the fund does not hold bitcoins. The ETFs enable investors to speculate on Bitcoin\u2019s future price moves without directly owning the cryptocurrency.\n\nUnlike spot Bitcoin ETFs, which hold the asset, futures-based ETFs use contracts where investors agree to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price in the future. This introduces an element of leverage and risk, as gains or losses are magnified based on the price trends of the underlying futures contracts.\n\nThe first bitcoin futures ETF to gain regulatory approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) on Oct. 15, 2021.\n\nBelow are the three largest bitcoin futures ETFs in terms of assets under management (AUM).\n\nProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO)\n\nPerformance over one year: 81.03% (as of Jan. 18, 2024)\n\nExpense ratio: 0.95%\n\nAnnual dividend yield: 8.79%\n\nThree-month average daily volume: 19,448,875\n\nAUM: $1.85 billion\n\nInception date: Oct. 18, 2021\n\nIssuer: ProShares\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF)\n\nPerformance over one year: 77.3% (as of Jan. 18, 2024)\n\nExpense ratio: 0.66%\n\nAnnual dividend yield: 0.18%\n\nThree-month average daily volume: 39,940\n\nAUM: $50.94 million\n\nInception date: Nov. 15, 2021\n\nIssuer: VanEck\n\nSimplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF (MAXI)\n\nPerformance over one year: 86.3%\n\nExpense ratio: 11.18%\n\nAnnual dividend yield: 273%\n\nThree-month average daily volume: 16,645\n\nAUM: $33.4 million\n\nInception date: Sept. 29, 2022\n\nIssuer: Simplify\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first 11 bitcoin spot ETFs in January, 2024. Unlike futures ETFs, these funds invest directly in the underlying cryptocurrency. As of Jan. 2024, the SEC has yet to approve an Ethereum spot ETF.\n\nWhat Are Ether Futures ETFs?\n\nEther futures ETFs are structured like Bitcoin futures ETFs: They both aim to track the performance of cryptocurrency futures contracts traded on the CME, not the underlying asset. Ether funds enable investors to speculate on ether\u2019s price fluctuations without directly owning the digital asset.\n\nLike Bitcoin futures ETFs, ether futures ETFs involve agreements to buy or sell ether futures contracts at a predetermined price in the future, which may magnify profits or losses. Ether futures ETFs furnish a regulated means for investors to gain exposure to ether without the hassles or expense of storing the cryptocurrency securely.\n\nBelow are the three largest ether futures ETFs in terms of AUM.\n\nVanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT)\n\nPerformance over one year: N/A\n\nExpense ratio: 0.66%\n\nAnnual dividend yield: N/A\n\nThree-month average daily volume: 19,111\n\nAUM: $19.1 million\n\nInception date: Oct. 2, 2023\n\nIssuer: VanEck\n\nProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH)\n\nPerformance over one year: N/A\n\nExpense ratio: 0.95%\n\nAnnual dividend yield: N/A\n\nThree-month average daily volume: 48,094\n\nAUM: $24.9 million\n\nInception date: Oct. 2, 2023\n\nIssuer: ProShares\n\nBitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH)\n\nPerformance over one year: N/A\n\nExpense ratio: 0.85%\n\nAnnual dividend yield: N/A\n\nThree-month average daily volume: 5,248\n\nAUM: $4.3 million\n\nInception date: Sept. 29, 2023\n\nIssuer: Bitwise Asset Management\n\n\n\nWhat Are the Key Differences Between Bitcoin Futures ETFs and Ether Futures ETFs?\n\nBitcoin and ether futures ETFs enable investors to have an indirect stake in digital assets through futures contracts. However, they differ in terms of their underlying assets and blockchain networks. Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, while ether futures ETFs are tied to Ethereum\u2019s native token, ether.\n\nEach varies in terms of its underlying blockchain technology and purpose. Bitcoin serves primarily as a decentralized digital currency and store of value, while Ethereum is a versatile blockchain that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nAdditionally, the ETFs differ in risk and volatility because of their distinct characteristics. Bitcoin, often considered a digital kind of gold and a hedge against inflation, tends to attract different investor sentiment from ether, which is essential for the Ethereum network\u2019s functionality. From a trading standpoint, Bitcoin futures ETFs turn over substantially more volume than ether futures ETFs, given Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance.

Factors such as contract expiration, rollover procedures, and the potential for leverage are among those to keep front of mind. Tracking errors: Bitcoin futures ETFs may face tracking errors, which occur when the fund\u2019s share values deviate from the spot price of Bitcoin because of fees or an imperfect replication of futures contracts. For instance, if the ETF sets out to mirror a 2% daily return on Bitcoin, it may only achieve a 1.5% return when considering these discrepancies.\n\nAdvantages Regulatory compliance\n\nDiversification\n\nAccessibility\n\nLower operational risks\n\nInstitutional adoption Disadvantages Price volatility\n\nUse of futures contracts\n\nTracking errors\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Ether ETFs\n\nAdvantages\n\nRegulatory compliance : Ether futures ETFs are offered within the regulatory frameworks of their markets, making them more palatable to institutional investors.\n\n: Ether futures ETFs are offered within the regulatory frameworks of their markets, making them more palatable to institutional investors.

Institutional adoption: Ether futures ETFs make it easier for institutional investors to obtain stakes in futures that track Ethereum, potentially encouraging wider participation and adoption.

Not only did these ETFs debut later than Bitcoin futures ETFs, but they also were listed during a cryptocurrency bear market, making it more difficult to attract investor inflows. Lower liquidity can hinder the ease of buying and selling ETF shares, potentially leading to higher bid-ask spreads and increased price slippage.\n\n: Since ether futures ETFs launched in October 2023, they have had far less trading volume than their Bitcoin counterparts.

Liquidity can vary significantly between these two types of ETFs. Bitcoin has been around longer and has broader market adoption. Thus, it has had higher liquidity. Since their debut in October 2023, trading for ether futures ETFs has been far more muted than those for Bitcoin.\n\nWhere Can Investors Acquire Ether and Bitcoin Directly? You have many avenues for buying Bitcoins and ether. Platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance are well-known choices for purchasing them, and you can do so via bank transfers, credit cards, or other cryptocurrencies. You can also seek out decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap or SushiSwap for peer-to-peer trading of ether.\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency? Crypto is a digital form of currency that deploys cryptography to produce secure financial transactions and control the supply of new tokens. Traditional currencies, like the U.S. dollar and the euro, are issued by governments or central banks, but cryptocurrencies operate on a technology called blockchain, which is a decentralized network spread among different networks and systems. Bitcoin, created in 2009, is still the best-known cryptocurrency, but thousands of others exist, including ether. Cryptocurrencies, like their government-issued counterparts, are a medium of exchange with vast uses, including buying goods and services, transferring money within and across borders, smart contracts, and further applications in decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nHow Does Futures Contract Expiry Impact Ether Futures ETFs and Bitcoin Futures ETFs? Both kinds of ETFs need to manage the rollover of their futures contracts, which occurs when expiring futures contracts are replaced with others with later expiry dates. However, the ether market is less mature and has less trading volume than Bitcoin futures ETFs. Thus, the process of rolling over ether futures contracts could involve higher costs, affecting the ETFs\u2019 performance.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin and ether futures ETFs enable investors with regulated exposure to cryptocurrency markets by holding futures contracts that set out to track the underlying assets. They are structured as traditional ETFs, providing a familiar investment product for those who want to speculate on the price fluctuations of Bitcoin and ether without having to own and store them.\n\nThe ETFs for each cryptocurrency may differ in risk, volatility, and returns because of their distinct characteristics. Before investing in either, you should consider the funds\u2019 specific market changes to ensure they meet your risk profile and investment goals.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "JONESBOROUGH, Tenn. (WJHL) \u2014 Washington County commissioners will consider a proposed settlement Monday in their lawsuit against BrightRidge and Bitcoin mine operator Red Dog Technologies, a wholly owned subsidiary of GRIID Infrastructure.\n\nAn agenda for the called 6 p.m. meeting shows that after a presentation of a proposed settlement agreement, the commission will enter a closed executive session. Certain matters related to the lawsuit, filed in November 2021, can be discussed without the presence of the public or media.\n\nAfter that, members of the public who sign up to address the settlement agreement issue will each have three minutes to speak. The only other item is discussion of the status and potential settlement of the lawsuit. GRIID, which gets about half its Bitcoin from the Red Dog site, lost $61 million in 2022 and $22 million in the first six months of 2023.\n\nLocated next to BrightRidge\u2019s Bailey Bridge Road substation in Limestone, the \u201cmine\u201d \u2014 where hundreds of high-powered computers perform complex equations to \u201cmine\u201d the cryptocurrency or validate its transactions \u2014 has been the subject of controversy since May 2021. That\u2019s when neighbors in the rural community began complaining about noise coming from the fans that are needed to cool the computers.\n\nBy late summer, commissioners learned that Zoning Administrator Angela Charles and County Attorney Allyson Wilkinson both believed the mine\u2019s function did not comply with the A-3 (agriculture business) zoning designation. BrightRidge had requested the property be rezoned from A-1 (general agriculture) to A-3 in February 2020 for what it described as a \u201cblockchain data center.\u201d\n\nThe rezoning request, which county commissioners approved unanimously, did not mention a Bitcoin mine or an operator other than BrightRidge.\n\nThe commission demanded that BrightRidge shut the operation down in September 2021. When that didn\u2019t happen, the commission filed suit.\n\nBefore the suit went to trial, Red Dog, BrightRidge and the county agreed to work toward a settlement. In June 2022, the commission approved a settlement that called for Red Dog to pay penalties totaling more than $200,000, relocate to the Washington County Industrial Park in Telford by the end of 2024, purchase the site for the new mine, and agree to penalties for decibel readings above 60 decibels.\n\nThe deal drew fresh public opposition from people living around the industrial park, and before it had time to be voted on in final form, a countywide election had changed the complexion of the commission. A follow-up vote on Nov. 28, 2022 failed 13-2, and early this year Washington County Chancery Court Judge John Rambo set a trial for Feb. 5-7, 2024.\n\nRed Dog parent co. lost $22 million first 6 months of 2023\n\nThe county will be negotiating with a wounded company that once had massive growth plans and hopes of going public. GRIID entered an agreement in late 2021 with a special purpose acquisition company, Adit EdTech, to take it public. There was much talk of a $3.3 billion value and growing from about 50 megawatts of capacity to more than 1,000.\n\nNone of that happened, and when the price of Bitcoin plummeted in the spring of 2022, the company \u2014 with roughly half its production capacity in Limestone \u2014 found itself unable to pay its creditors. It restructured its loan and as of late 2022, owed more than $57 million.\n\nThrough the first six months of 2023, GRIID posted an operating loss of $9.4 million and a total loss of $22 million according to Adit EdTech SEC filings. The public offering has continued to be delayed, and the prospects of GRIID having the capacity to construct a new mining operation in Washington County would depend on the appetite of Blockchain Access, GRIID\u2019s primary lender, to spend additional capital to stand up a new facility."

        "content": "This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin and ether. We\u2019ve also included XRP, as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia, a cryptocurrency is \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.\u201d Cryptocurrency is a young asset class that has developed a reputation for price volatility; however, there are ETFs that could help mitigate risk for those investors seeking crypto exposure.\n\nBitcoin was the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide. Ether is another cryptocurrency, run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three with its launch in July 2015. XRP, which is owned by Ripple and launched in 2012, was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. We\u2019ve included it here for reference.\n\nThe third-largest market share of cryptocurrency, tether, is a token \u201cbacked by actual assets\u201d which includes one U.S. dollar, one euro, or loans to affiliate companies, and is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex. It\u2019s a controversial cryptocurrency due to its alleged manipulation of crypto pricing. It is called a \u201cstable coin\u201d because it was designed to always be worth $1.00. We do not chart it because its price rarely changes.\n\nFor a better understanding of crypto market cycles, read more here.\n\nThe Latest Crypto Data (through October 24, 2023)\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price surged this past week, reaching its highest level since May 2022. BTC is now up over 100% year to date. Some market observers are optimistic that the digital currency can continue to build on the recent, modest gains as well as provide some protection against inflation.\n\nXRP\u2019s price also jumped this week, reaching its highest level in over two months. XRP is currently up ~62% year to date.\n\nEther\u2019s price rose to its highest level since August and is now up ~48% year-to-date.\n\nAn index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. Ether tops the chart, i.e., the price of an ether has changed the most out of all three cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs associated with cryptocurrencies include: ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI).\n\nby Jennifer Nash of VettaFi | Advisor Perspectives, 10/25/23\n\nOriginally published on Advisor Perspectives.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel."

        "content": "An advertisement for bitcoin cryptocurrency is displayed on a street in Hong Kong on Feb. 17, 2022. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency soared to almost $35,000 this week, marking its highest value in nearly 18 months.\n\nCryptocurrency bitcoin breached the $35,000 mark briefly Wednesday for the first time in 18 months and is riding a 20% value surge over the last week. The token was trading around $34,675 later in the day.\n\nBut why the sudden bounce?\n\nMounting evidence suggests bitcoin, and potentially other cryptocurrencies, could be getting close to entering a more mainstream investment window via exchange-traded funds that can be bought and sold on a stock exchange.\n\nAccording to a breakdown by Investopedia, an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is a type of pooled investment security that operates much like a mutual fund. Typically, ETFs will track a particular index, sector, commodity or other assets, but unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same way that a regular stock can. An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities, per Investopedia.\n\nA spot bitcoin ETF, which is simply an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of bitcoin, opens the door for, in this case, bitcoin investing without having to manage a crypto account or crypto wallet.\n\nA move by investment giant BlackRock is powering up the hype around bitcoin ETFs after financial services provider Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation posted BlackRock\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF on an eligibility list, even though the fund is still awaiting approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. And some investors are seeing the move as a sign that SEC approval could be forthcoming.\n\n\u201cThis listing in the DTCC does not mean that the fund has actually been launched or that this will inevitably happen,\u201d Samer Hasn, market analyst at online brokerage XS.com, told CNN. \u201cHowever, it may appear as part of BlackRock\u2019s preparations to launch the ETF soon.\u201d\n\nEarlier this summer, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned an SEC decision to reject a spot bitcoin ETF application from crypto asset management firm Grayscale, in a ruling that noted the regulator had failed to adequately explain why it rejected the firm\u2019s application, per CNN.\n\nAll signs appear to be pointing to crypto investment having a new presence via ETF opportunities and that collective vibe is helping drive the current rise in valuations.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant development and shows that U.S. institutions and U.S. investors are embracing the news that a U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded-fund (ETF) appears imminent,\u201d wrote Markus Thielen, head of research at crypto services provider Matrixport, according to a report from CoinDesk."

Its inhabitants spend winter in a cold, still darkness but enjoy 11:00 pm sunsets in summertime.\n\nHelsinki Cathedral at sunrise, after a night of partying. (Elias Ahonen)\n\nMajor population centers are nearby, with both Tampere and Turku reachable in two hours via road or rail. There are regular ferry services across the Baltic \u2014 including to Estonia\u2019s capital of Tallinn, which can be reached in two hours by sea, and there are also plans to link the cities via an undersea tunnel. The nearby Helsinki-Vantaa airport is the country\u2019s main international gateway and serves as a transfer hub for Asia.\n\nFinland has been ranked the happiest country in the world for six consecutive years by the World Happiness Report. Its income tax rate tops out at 56% \u2014 one of the highest in the world \u2014 and the tax data of every resident is public. Helsinki played host to the 1952 Summer Olympics. The country joined the European Union in 1995 and adopted the euro as its currency in 1999. In 2023, Finland became a member of NATO.\n\nAs the capital, Helsinki\u2019s crypto events draw participants from across the country, making it the natural meeting place for the industry. For that reason, projects and companies from nearby cities like Tampere and Turku are also included here.\n\nThe area was first settled around 5000 BC as the ice age retreated. Vikings raided the established settlements, as did Swedish crusaders in the 10th and 13th centuries. The city was formally established in 1550 as a Swedish trading post, defended by Suomenlinna (Finland\u2019s fortress), the largest sea fort in Europe. Later, under Russian control as the Grand Duchy of Finland, the emperor moved the capital from Turku to Helsinki, which was closer to St. Petersburg. Finland became independent in 1917, after which it resisted Soviet occupation in the 1940 Winter War.\n\nThe Finnish Parliament. (Elias Ahonen)\n\nHelsinki\u2019s claim to crypto fame rests with Martti Malmi, a software developer who in 2009 sold 5,050 BTC for a $5.02 PayPal transfer, marking the first time that Bitcoin was exchanged for fiat currency. It occurred before the much better-known May 22, 2010, \u201cPizza Day,\u201d when Bitcoin was first used to purchase a physical good. Eventually, Malmi used most of his Bitcoin to purchase a studio in the metro area. If he\u2019d hung on to it, it\u2019d be worth $171 million today. The Bitcoin was used to seed an exchange called New Liberty Standard, which established the first BTC price of 1,309.03 BTC for $1.\n\nFound the first known bitcoin to USD transaction from my email backups.

In 1991, Linus Torvalds began working on what became Linux at the University of Helsinki. It is also home to many video game companies, with local firm Rovio\u2019s Angry Birds achieving global fame in 2009. Helsinki is also the home of Aave founder Stani Kulechov, though he has moved abroad with the company.\n\nIn 2019, a then-staunchly Bitcoin maximalist group called Konsensus organized the translation of Saifedean Ammous\u2019 2018 book The Bitcoin Standard into Finnish, and later also translated The Little Bitcoin Book by The Bitcoin Collective. According to one member, the organization has since become more accepting of other cryptocurrencies and blockchain use cases.\n\nThe \u201ccrypto community\u201d in Helsinki and Finland is somewhat disorganized and divided, with many enthusiasts being interested in one facet \u2014 be it Bitcoin, NFTs or Web3 \u2014 without embracing the whole, and thus having few common threads. Still, a certain grassroots energy is evident.\n\nThe founding meeting of The Finnish Bitcoin Association in Helsinki on May 6, 2023. (Elias Ahonen)\n\nPaying with Bitcoin is not common in Finland, where card and app payments dominate. One notable exception is the restaurant Faro, at which a few people are likely to buy a burger and beers with sats at the monthly Bitcoin meetup.\n\nOn the bar side, Taudo Baari and Time Bar also accept crypto. There is also the Osuva shooting range.\n\nSamuel Harjunp\u00e4\u00e4, CEO and co-founder of hardware startup Xellox and regular at the Faro Bitcoin meetup, tells Magazine about the state of Bitcoin acceptance:\n\n\u201cA few restaurants and bars have already been \u2018orange-pilled\u2019 \u2014 the biggest obstacles are the payment infrastructure and bookkeeping.\u201d\n\nToday, Helsinki has a vibrant tech and startup scene with many coworking spaces. The city is also host to the annual Slush startup conference, which draws 25,000 participants.\n\nWeb3 Helsinki is a student-run organization that organized its first event on April 20, 2020, with about 150 people in attendance, making it perhaps the largest single crypto event of the year.\n\n2023\u2019s events have included the Web3 Bash in late April, followed by the Aurora Nordic Web3 Conference in June. On June 6, the BRIDG3 Blockchain summit was held at Tampere\u2019s Nokia Arena, focusing on Web3, the metaverse and decentralized autonomous organizations.\n\nThe Aurora Nordic Web3 Conference, held in Helsinki on June 6, 2023.

Upon the conclusion of formalities, the saunas of the hosting coworking space were fired up.\n\nFor those interested in NFTs, Fungi is a platform advertising a no-code solution that lets organizations build NFT-based communities. One of these was a metaverse island called Cornerstone for VR studio ZOAN, where 100 plots could be purchased as NFTs.\n\nHABBO NFT, operated by the local creators of the 23-year-old online chat room game HABBO Hotel, has dropped an 11,600-piece avatar collection on OpenSea and is currently developing an NFT-based game. A group called The Future of Art has also dedicated itself to promoting digital art and runs an NFT gallery.\n\nThe Finnish Web3 Landscape, according to Tampere-based The Good Cartel, which exists to support Finnish Web3 startups.

It was founded circa 2012 and installed the country\u2019s first Bitcoin ATM at the Helsinki railway station in December 2013.\n\nThe company was also a distributor of Casascius physical Bitcoin and eventually made its own line of \u201cDenarium\u201d wallets. The parent company, Coinmotion \u2014 based a few hours north in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 \u2014 now operates a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nAnother major Finnish exchange called Northcrypto can be found in Turku.\n\nA euro stablecoin has also been developed in the city. Membrane Finance\u2019s EUROe was launched in February 2023 and is designed to be an \u201cEU-regulated full-reserve stablecoin\u201d that is compliant with recent legislation.

(Elias Ahonen)\n\nIn 2018, the Finnish customs service planned to auction 1,666 BTC that it had seized in a drug case, but decided not to proceed \u201cdue to concerns that the virtual money would return to the hands of criminals,\u201d displaying a rather negative official view of cryptocurrency. In July 2022, the state eventually auctioned nearly 2,000 BTC for $47 million, with proceeds being donated to Ukraine.\n\nThe Finnish Government decided on significant additional aid to #Ukraine.

In 2022, a Helsinki watch dealer fell victim to a common crypto scam, handing over Rolex watches worth $400,000 after mistakenly believing that he had received a Bitcoin transaction.\n\nCryptocurrency, often adjacent to scams in the news, has come to be viewed with a relatively high degree of suspicion across most of society. Commenting on the decision to halt the 2018 customs seizure sale, Pekka Pylkk\u00e4nen, head of finance at the Finnish Customs Service, highlighted concerns about money laundering, telling national broadcaster YLE that \u201cthe buyers of cyber currency rarely use them for normal endeavors.\u201d\n\nNational media regularly interview outspoken cryptocurrency critic Aleksi Grym, head of fintech for the Finnish Central Bank, as an authoritative expert without seeking alternative pro-cryptocurrency views, though coverage has been improving.\n\nAs one may notice from this article, the term \u201cWeb3\u201d is preferred, presumably due to its distancing from the negative stereotypes of cryptocurrency.\n\nNeither the country\u2019s political establishment nor any major party or other large grouping of the population could be described outright as being \u201cpro-crypto.\u201d\n\nOne reason for this could be Finland\u2019s stable, highly functional, and high-trust society, in which most people do not see the need to \u201cdisrupt\u201d or fix something with cryptocurrency. Bank transfers are free and near-instantaneous across the EU, with cash use increasingly rare. Virtually nobody is unbanked, and the most trusted institution is the police, with 95% public support. Harjunp\u00e4\u00e4, whose startup is working on solutions to protect private keys, explains the disconnect:\n\n\u201cMany people don\u2019t understand Bitcoin and think it\u2019s something between criminal money and a pyramid scheme.\u201d\n\nIt is also notable that the \u201cmoon\u201d mentality and dreams of quick wealth found in many cryptocurrency investors are generally seen in a particularly negative light, with Malmi noting that he never set out to make money with Bitcoin, \u201cperhaps owing to Finnish culture\u201d and his idealistic mentality.\n\nIn the same vein, cryptocurrencies are seen by some as drivers of inequality in a country where large differences in wealth are often considered taboo.\n\nThe Finnish Innovation Fund, or Sitra, has stated it as a priority to accelerate the local development of Web3 services, saying that \u201cit\u2019s in Finland\u2019s interest to play an active role in ensuring that the metaverse is created in line with European values.\u201d\n\nThe fund has also worked with the Finnish National Gallery to create The Finnish Metagallery, an art gallery in the Decentraland metaverse whose building is modeled from the Finnish Pavilion as it appeared at the 1900 Paris World Fair.\n\nJohanna Eiramo from the Finnish National Gallery presenting The Finnish Metagallery in Helsinki at Web3 Bash on April 27.

        "content": "With optimism around eventual spot bitcoin ETF approval ramping up, the exact impact such a product will have is hard to pinpoint.\n\nBut the impact gold ETFs had on the products\u2019 underlying asset could foreshadow the effect of yet-to-be-seen bitcoin fund launches, some industry executives say.\n\nBitcoin ETFs could see $14.4 billion of inflows in their first year of trading, according to a Tuesday report by Galaxy Digital research associate Charles Yu. The price of bitcoin could increase by 74% in the 12 months following approval, he added.\n\nYu\u2019s flow estimate comes from an assumption that BTC is adopted by 10% of total assets across three wealth management channels, with an average allocation of 1%. Assets managed by brokers-dealers, banks and registered investment advisers (RIAs) total roughly $48 trillion, according to the report.\n\nThe Galaxy research associate then looked to the gold market as a point of comparison to determine the impact of bitcoin ETFs on BTC\u2019s price.\n\nRead more: AllianceBernstein calls bitcoin a \u2018safe haven asset,\u2019 more attractive than gold\n\nThe price of gold has roughly quadrupled since State Street Global Advisors launched the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) in November 2004.\n\nLoading Tweet..\n\nGold ETFs held $198bn in assets under management, as of Sept. 30 \u2014 representing about 1.7% of the gold supply, according to World Gold Council data. The value of bitcoin held in investment products amounted to $21.7 billion at that time, or roughly 4.3% of total issued supply.\n\n\u201cWith gold having an estimated ~24x larger market capitalization and 36% less supply held in investment vehicles compared to bitcoin, we assume a dollar-equivalent amount of fund inflows having a ~8.8x greater impact on bitcoin markets compared to gold markets,\u201d according to Yu.\n\nBy applying the year-one estimate of bitcoin ETF inflows into the historical relationship between gold ETF fund flows and the change in gold\u2019s price, Galaxy Digital predicts a 6.2% price jump for BTC in the first month that a US bitcoin fund is offered, he adds.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price increase could gradually decline to 3.7% by the last month of the first year, the report states \u2014 resulting in a potential 74% rise in those 12 months.\n\nThe year-one bitcoin price increase estimate was from its price of $26,920 at the end of September. The BTC price has risen substantially since then, hovering around $34,000 Wednesday morning.\n\nGabor Gurbacs, director of digital asset strategy at VanEck, noted in a September X post that bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization of roughly $500 billion at that time is about a quarter of what gold\u2019s market cap was in 2004.\n\n\u201cIn my view, upon the approval of a US spot bitcoin ETF, bitcoin\u2019s price trajectory could follow gold\u2019s blueprint from 2004 and the years after just much faster,\u201d Gurbacs wrote, noting bitcoin\u2019s \u201csystematic scarcity\u201d via halving schedules.\n\nAfter estimated year-one inflows of $14.4 billion, Galaxy predicts nearly $27 billion and $39 billion of inflows into bitcoin ETFs in the second and third year, respectively.\n\nRead more: An approved spot bitcoin ETF could be \u2018one of the largest launches in history\u2019\n\nBitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan said during an August webinar earlier that his firm estimates US spot bitcoin ETFs could $55 billion in net flows in their first five years on the market. He noted at the time that he believes the ETF sector could ultimately reach the level of assets under management seen in gold ETFs.\n\n\u201cETFs were a game-changer for gold because they brought new investors and new demand into a market with relatively fixed supply,\u201d Hougan said in a Tuesday X post. \u201cSound familiar?\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Should You Buy Bitcoin While It's Down? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The rally in Bitcoin (BTC -3.20%) may not count as a bull market as it tries to shake off the frost from a brutal crypto winter, but the world's most valuable cryptocurrency has more than doubled in 2023. Helping to add to a solid year, over the last few days, Bitcoin mustered enough momentum to break through the $30,000 mark and surge to a new yearly high. Yet even with a fresh rally, sentiment remains overwhelmingly bearish as Bitcoin's price is still more than 50% off of its all-time high.\n\nFor now, Bitcoin is teetering between the depths of a bear market and potentially preparing for a resurgence. As it continues to navigate this fine line, there are two reasons investors should treat this as a buying opportunity in preparation of looming unprecedented pressure on Bitcoin's finite supply.\n\nA supply scarcity game changer\n\nBitcoin's halving events, which occur roughly every four years, have been instrumental in its transformation into a scarce digital asset and ascension to the most valuable cryptocurrency. The principle is straightforward: After every 210,000 blocks, the rewards granted to miners are cut in half. This automatic mechanism reduces Bitcoin's supply growth rate and makes it scarcer with each passing event. Currently, miners receive 6.25 bitcoins for their efforts, but in just 172 days, this figure will drop to 3.125.\n\nThis simple supply-and-demand dynamic has been a driving force behind Bitcoin's historical price surges, especially in post-halving years. As the next halving approaches, the growth in Bitcoin's supply will slow, potentially amplifying its value -- provided demand remains steady.\n\nYet this halving might be unlike any seen before. When observing data related to the number of Bitcoins on exchanges, there is a clear trend of an increasing supply until March 2020, when supply peaked at nearly 3.2 million coins. However, since then, it has been a different story. Currently sitting at 2.3 million, the number of coins available today is at levels last seen in the spring of 2018.\n\nThere are likely a handful of reasons behind this, but the most straightforward explanation is related to the reduction of Bitcoin's supply growth. Up until March 2020, the supply growth of Bitcoin seems to have outpaced demand, at least enough to cause Bitcoins to pile up on exchanges. But after the most recent halving in May 2020, the situation changed as the available supply of coins significantly diminished.\n\nThe institutional floodgates are opening\n\nOver the course of Bitcoin's evolution, there has been a widespread belief that it would one day mature enough to be sought after by mainstream institutional investors. Yet after the token went on a historic run in 2021 en route to an all-time high of nearly $69,000, the number of deep-pocketed institutions clamoring for Bitcoin exposure remained minuscule, with just a handful of companies including Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Block leading the way. But that might finally be changing.\n\nJune of this year marked a turning point as BlackRock (BLK -2.12%), the world's largest asset manager, applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for approval to create a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The potential approval of a spot ETF could revolutionize institutional adoption, opening doors to clients with retirement plans, IRAs (individual retirement accounts), pensions, and more. Following BlackRock's filing, an array of Wall Street giants, including Fidelity, Invesco, Ark Invest, and VanEck, also entered the Bitcoin ETF race.\n\nWhile spot Bitcoin ETF applications have been submitted here and there since 2013, all have been denied thus far. But there's growing optimism that this time will be different due to the prominence of these firms and the recent legal battles between the SEC and crypto defendants tipping in favor of the accused.\n\nQuantifying the impact an approval would have, Steven Schoenfeld, former managing director for BlackRock, surmised that approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the SEC is a near certainty at this point and would bring $200 billion to Bitcoin in the short term. More optimistic estimates claim that approval of the ETF could unleash $600 billion into the Bitcoin market. Considering Bitcoin's current market cap hovers at about $650 billion, these numbers could easily move its price.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nIn the short term, it's easy to understand bearish sentiments surrounding Bitcoin, especially when comparing its current price to the all-time high. However, when looking at the bigger picture, there's a compelling case for a resurgence. The combination of an imminent halving, diminishing available supply, and billions of institutional dollars knocking on Bitcoin's door is coalescing to drive the price up.\n\nInvestors who maintain a long-term perspective, understanding that this is a marathon, not a sprint, are poised for the most lucrative rewards. With Bitcoin's price still significantly below its peak, those who invest now have the potential to reap substantial gains in the coming years as Bitcoin enters a new chapter of its success story."

Canada and the EU already have their own spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nQuartly-Janeiro notes to CCN that if investors can access the major cryptocurrencies through ETFs in one place cheaply, then \u201cwhy wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d In his view, exchanges would struggle to compete against \u201chuge asset managers, some of which are several times larger than G10 economies.\u201d The migration of users would likely be gradual, but could accelerate if no compelling reasons remain to stay on exchanges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the reason why people use certain supermarkets; convenience, price, and choice,\u201d explained Quartly-Janeiro.\n\nTo stay competitive, exchanges need to take action.\n\nQuartly-Janeiro advises they should increase transparency, leverage their established user base, expand offerings, pursue growth, engage in [mergers and acquisitions] activity, build international brands, and aggressively enter new markets. The goal, he said, is to ensure individuals and institutions alike view them as viable options.\n\nWhilst markets are abuzz with excitement, additional spot ETFs beyond Bitcoin could be a death blow, with Ethereum ETFs inevitably following Bitcoin. With the top 20-40 cryptocurrencies completely dominating total market capitalization, most activity could shift to ETFs if they were approved.\n\nTraders could simply buy and sell the ETFs instead of using exchanges. As Quartly-Janeiro asks, \u201cwhy pay more\u201d on exchanges when you can access the major cryptocurrencies more cheaply?\n\nA Big If\n\nAt that point, exchanges must provide unique trading pairs and improve offerings to attract activity. But this is also a challenge for smaller cryptocurrency projects if the large caps consolidate power within ETFs. Quartly-Janeiro likens it to smaller equity markets in Europe, where liquidity and interest wane if you aren\u2019t listed on the main exchange.\n\nOf course, whether or not large capitalization crypto ETFs could drain liquidity and volume from exchanges depends on their approval. That, in turn, depends on who occupies the chairmanship of the SEC, an agency that has dragged its heels on spot Bitcoin ETFs for over a decade. After all, the first application for a spot Bitcoin ETF was filed all the way back in 2013 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Both are now owners of the cryptocurrency exchange, Gemini.\n\nTo compete with ETFs, crypto exchanges would also benefit from an improved user experience outside of their platforms, including more user-friendly wallets on and off their exchanges. That, by and large, is out of their control."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s surge toward $35,000 has helped lift a number of altcoins, some of which have recorded double-digit percentage gains over the past week. Although smaller meme tokens often see a jump following a Bitcoin rally, more established altcoins have joined the party.\n\nSolana, branded by some as an \u201cEthereum killer,\u201d has shaken off a slump caused by frequent mentions in the first weeks of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s ongoing trial. The token notched a gain of 40% over the past week, and as of Wednesday afternoon Solana was trading at $33.28, up 8.3% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe token has been the most popular altcoin for investors in major exchange-traded products so far this year, according to a report by CoinShares. Last week alone, investors poured $15.5 million into the token, an inflow of capital that trailed only Bitcoin\u2019s. Last week\u2019s investment puts year-to-date inflows to Solana at $74 million, according to the report.\n\nOther winners from this week\u2019s rally included lesser-known tokens such as Chainlink and Aptos, as well as the meme token Pepe.\n\nChainlink, a coin with close ties to the decentralized oracle network of the same name, jumped 56.6% over the past week and was trading up 11.7%, at $11.12, on Wednesday afternoon, according to CoinGecko.\n\nAptos was just behind Chainlink, with a 35% weekly gain. The token was up 6.1% on Wednesday.\n\nAnd although its valuation is based mostly on hype, the Pepe coin had one of the best weekly performances, gaining 88%\u2014and about 24% over the past 24 hours.\n\nPartly fueling the rally across the board is a bet by investors that the Securities and Exchange Commission will soon approve a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. TradFi giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have already filed applications, and analysts at Bloomberg put the odds of a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved by January at 90%."

        "title": "Bitcoin: Store of Value or Currency? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Satoshi's Vision\n\nAccording to the white paper \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\u201d published by the pseudonymous figure Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, Bitcoin was created as a response to the flaws in the traditional financial system. Nakamoto\u2019s primary motivation was establishing a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. Bitcoin aims to enable secure, transparent, borderless transactions while addressing concerns related to the \u201cdouble-spending problem\u201d (where the same digital token is spent more than once).\n\nRegardless of where you stand on Bitcoin, it\u2019s tough to argue that it hasn\u2019t been a raging success and probably has blown up more than Nakamoto ever dreamed. For example, in late 2009, the first recorded exchange of Bitcoin for dollars pegged one Bitcoin\u2019s value at $0.00099. Today, that number has ballooned to ~$35,000 per coin, and if Bitcoin were a stock, it would be in the top 10 in terms of market value ($668B USD). Today, we will do our best to illustrate unbiased arguments and data for Bitcoin as a currency or store of value:\n\nArguments for Bitcoin as a Currency\n\nProponents of Bitcoin as a currency highlight its potential to revolutionize the traditional banking system. They argue that Bitcoin transactions are fast, borderless, and offer low transaction fees compared to traditional banking systems or international money transfers. Evidence is starting to mount that citizens in hyper-inflation plagues countries are using Bitcoin as an alternative currency. Did you know Bitcoin\u2019s price recently notched an all-time high versus three hyperinflation-plagued nations? (Nigeria, Turkey, Argentina) Impressive when you consider that Bitcoin is far off of its highs of $69,000 versus the US Dollar.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nPictured: Bitcoin vs. Turkish Lira\n\nSpin: Currently, it is hard to argue that Bitcoin\u2019s primary function is as a currency. However, in inflation-plagued countries like Nigeria, Turkey, and Argentina, desperate citizens are turning to Bitcoin as a way of escaping the financial prison that is rampant inflation. For countries like the United States, Bitcoin does not make sense to use as a currency as the US Dollar offers far more stability.\n\nStory continues\n\nArguments for Bitcoin as a Store of Value\n\nBitcoin advocates argue that it serves as a store of value akin to gold. Benefits of Bitcoin include its limited supply (only 21 million coins will ever exist) versus traditional currencies that can be printed in unlimited quantities, leading to inflation. Proponents also argue that Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity and the decentralized nature of blockchain technology make it a reliable store of value. Amidst geopolitical escalations, rampant global inflation, and volatility in equities, Bitcoin is up more than 100% in 2023. In the past, Bitcoin has not only survived but thrived in situations like the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the 2020 Covid-crash. In recent months, Bitcoin and Gold (universally thought of as the main store of value) have decoupled from the equity markets and gained ground.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Miles Deutscher\n\nPictured: Bitcoin (orange) decouples from traditional assets.\n\nSpin: With the US National Debtencroaching on nearly $50 trillion (and likely to grow due to geopolitical escalations in the Middle East and Europe), it\u2019s tough to argue against an alternative that has a limited supply and has held its value since its inception in 2009. The comparison chart between gold and Bitcoin provides further evidence.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThere is much more to the Bitcoin bull move than the hype surrounding a potential ETF approval. Evidence is mounting that Bitcoin is not only a trading vehicle but is becoming a real-world currency and a store of value.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "US spot Bitcoin ETFs \u2014 crypto's silver bullet? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "One approval and the dominoes will fall. That\u2019s the dogma driving expectations for a U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). If only the industry\u2019s bogeymen at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would approve that one application, approvals will snowball, institutional cash will flood in, and all will be right in the world of the blockchain.\n\nThat goal appeared to edge a step closer Monday. The SEC confirmed it will not contest a court decision in favor of digital asset investment firm Grayscale\u2019s right to convert its GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) into a spot Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin was up over 19% for the past seven days on the back of the news, sitting above the US$34,000 support level as of 2.30 p.m. Wednesday in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The coin briefly broke US$35,000 during Tuesday trading, its highest level since May 2022.\n\nA Grayscale spokesperson said that the company now hopes to \u201cwork constructively\u201d with the SEC on its efforts to convert GBTC \u2014 currently the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fund with US$16.7 billion in assets under management \u2014 into a spot Bitcoin ETF. \u201cGBTC is operationally ready, and we intend to move as expeditiously as possible on behalf of our investors,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Grayscale investors who are waiting for a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF. The financial instrument \u2014 which would allow investors a way to invest in the coin on a traditional exchange \u2014 is seen as a way to open up the still marginal world of crypto investment to traditional finance.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a lot of people getting into crypto by the way of an ETF,\u201d said Jack Jia, head of crypto at payment platform Unlimit. He said the primary benefit of a spot Bitcoin ETF is that it improves the user experience (UX) for would-be crypto investors.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t need to use account abstraction or a custodial wallet because their UX is their broker,\u201d Jia added. \u201cThey\u2019re telling their customers or their clients to buy Bitcoin. So that is going to be the onboarding process, if you will.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nOther than Grayscale, a range of institutional investors, from BlackRock to Fidelity to Ark Invest, have applied to the SEC for permission to create a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S., the world\u2019s largest economy. The SEC has so far either rejected or delayed making a decision on the applications, citing fears about a lack of liquidity and price manipulation in crypto markets.\n\nBut Vivian Fang, a FinTech expert and professor of finance at Indiana University, said she sees various signs that the SEC is now \u201cwarming up\u201d to the idea of approving a spot Bitcoin ETF. She pointed to recent comments coming out of the regulator that it now considers the Bitcoin market to be of a sufficient size to resist market manipulation.\n\nThis, Fang said, has made her feel \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the SEC will approve at least one spot Bitcoin ETF application by the end of this year.\n\nBullish behavior\n\nAccording to research released Oct. 16 by blockchain data firm CryptoQuant, an SEC decision to allow the creation of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the seven largest asset managers with pending applications could bring up to US$155 billion into the Bitcoin market. Based on their analysis of the coin\u2019s past bull run behavior, CryptoQuant calculated that would increase Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization by US$450 billion to US$900 billion, adding US$1 trillion to the wider crypto market along the way.\n\nThe Next Wave of #Bitcoin Institutional Adoption:\n\nThe Launch of Spot ETFs\n\n\n\n\u2013 SPOT ETFS AS THE NEW WAY OF INSTITUTIONAL ADOPTION.\n\n\u2013 IMPLICATIONS OF ETF APPROVALS FOR BITCOIN MARKET CAPITALIZATION.\n\n\n\nPrepared by Our Head of Research, @jjcmoreno.\n\n\n\nLink\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/dKyd5GJJdT pic.twitter.com/ECEWMpkf0g \u2014 CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 16, 2023\n\nThe crypto market has, over the past week in particular, shown a wholehearted desire to buy into that narrative. Crypto media picked up on a social media post Oct. 16 saying the SEC had approved BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF application. The crypto market blew up. The price of Bitcoin soared nearly 10%, rising to around US$30,000 before falling back down to the US$28,000 range.\n\nThe news, it turned out, was fake. Regardless, there was around US$100 million in BTC liquidations in the first 30 minutes following the story. Cointelegraph, the media organization that first reported on the misleading post, issued a clarification statement apologizing for the error. But the damage \u2014 or the improvement, depending on which way you look at it \u2014 was done.\n\nWhether or not the original post was a legitimate attempt to manipulate the market or simply a prank gone too far, the fake news attracted a flood of interest and mainstream media attention to the ongoing ETF discussion.\n\nBlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, once a vocal skeptic of the crypto industry, appeared on a Fox Business broadcast, saying that the Bitcoin price rally to US$30,000 was more than just investors buying the rumor. Rather, he said, it was \u201can example of pent-up interest in crypto\u201d trading as a \u201cflight to quality\u201d during a time of geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nOn Monday, Oct. 23, as the market digested the likelihood the SEC would forgo an appeal on the Grayscale decision, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence highlighted that BlackRock had listed its spot Bitcoin ETF on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website.\n\nA bullish sign that the ETF could soon see approval from the SEC, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF specialist Eric Balchunas posted to X (formally Twitter) that this was \u201canother step in the process of launching.\u201d\n\nNote: Seeding is typically not a lot of money just enough to get ETF going. So I wouldn't read this as 'omg Blackrock is buying a ton of bitcoin' at all but more the fact they doing it and disclosing it shows another step in the process of launching. \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 23, 2023\n\nRoad bumps\n\nWhile the road ahead for one, if not multiple spot Bitcoin ETF approvals appears to be growing smoother, there are potential road bumps ahead. For Adam Berker, senior legal counsel at global payment platform Mercuryo, the principal obstacle remains the potential for lawsuits against the SEC.\n\n\u201cIf the regulator were to accept the ongoing application from BlackRock, it may be criticized in the future over why it gave a green light for a large institutional player from the [traditional finance] sector while raising so much fuss over younger and smaller crypto projects,\u201d Berker said via a note.\n\nThe past 18 months in the crypto industry have been characterized by corporate failures and capital flight resulting in a two-thirds drop off in the value of a once US$3 trillion industry. From the perspective of many crypto advocates, much of those losses were caused by increased scrutiny and so-called \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d from the SEC and fellow regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nThe two regulators have sued a number of crypto firms throughout that period, including cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Coinbase, alongside blockchain software firm Ripple. They have also prevented some cryptocurrency-related financial products such as a spot Bitcoin ETF from taking off. Finance professor Fang described the spate of lawsuits as part of an ongoing \u201cturf war\u201d between the two regulators as to who gets to regulate the crypto industry in future.\n\nThe lack of clarity on that issue, Fang said, adds to a number of other uncertainties hanging over crypto and potentially hampering the creation of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Chief among those is the question of whether or not cryptocurrencies are securities.\n\n\u201cIf they are, then the SEC must regulate them as it regulates stocks and bonds, but I am not sure the SEC can or has resources to (even if it wants to),\u201d Fang wrote in an email. \u201cFor example, can the SEC demand all investors of Bitcoin be registered (the KYC rule)?\u201d\n\nWith regulators unwilling to adopt a particular position on those issues, Fang added, the prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF appears less like a silver bullet for the crypto industry and more like a stop-gap measure as the different regulators get their houses in order.\n\n\u201cI view a spot Bitcoin ETF as a bone that the SEC is willing to throw to the industry after taking a tough stance against many crypto exchanges,\u201d Fang said."

        "title": "Bitcoin mining stocks are poised for a fall if the cryptocurrency hits this key level - CNBC",
        "content": "Now that bitcoin has pushed above its key resistance level of the year, the pressure is on for mining stocks, some of which could be in trouble if the cryptocurrency doesn't reach $50,000 by the second quarter of 2024. Earlier this week bitcoin climbed as high as $35,000 at one point, after being stuck under $30,000 for several months. But the Bitcoin halving is expected in the spring and it will likely reduce companies' revenue. That means the cryptocurrency may need to rally another 60% by then to lessen the suffering of some high-cost miners. \"Bitcoin prices holding steady at ($28,000-$32,000) is not tenable for a number of crypto companies, and especially not for high-cost miners,\" Needham's John Todaro said in a note this week. \"We anticipate material stock upside for Coinbase and low-cost miners if bitcoin prices surpass $45,000-$50,000 by the anticipated halving date of April 15, 2024, and material weakness if prices cannot sustain $45,000+ post-halving, in particular for high-cost miners.\" \"Post halving, lower-cost miners will take market share while higher cost producers will need to cut hash power contributed to the network until bitcoin prices rise,\" he added. Bitcoin's price is currently sitting just below $34,000, and chart analysts expect higher lows as well as higher highs over the next few months, with some anticipating it reaches $40,000 by the end of 2023. The Bitcoin halving event is highly anticipated event by crypto investors because it historically has set the stage for new bull runs. It takes place every four years when the reward for mining bitcoin \u2013 which makes up a significant portion of mining companies' revenue \u2013 is cut in half. That reduction is mandated by the Bitcoin code to reduce the supply of the cryptocurrency over time. \"The bitcoin mining industry is at a crucible moment as management teams (and investors) weigh the prospects of a bitcoin ETF, which may catalyze a rally, against record hashrate increases and the looming block reward halving that threaten industry revenues and profitability,\" JPMorgan analyst Reginald Smith said in an Oct. 11 note. \"With that as a back drop, we think discipline and timing are paramount and favor operators that offer the best relative value in light of their existing hashrate, operational efficiency, power contracts, funded growth plans and liquidity.\" Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms are the largest mining stocks by market cap. Marathon famously has the highest energy costs and lowest margins, while Riot has relatively low power costs but shares are expensive. CLSK YTD mountain Cleanspark shares year to date CleanSpark is the only mining stock in JPMorgan's coverage universe with an overweight rating, though its price target implies a 12% decline from current levels. Needham highlighted Riot and Cipher as its favorites, noting that their diversified revenue exposure could make impact from the halving more muted. Lower revenue, higher costs Generally, the mining stocks benefit from bitcoin price increases because those translate into higher mining revenue for the company. Riot shares have risen more than 10% over the past week, while CleanSpark climbed 12%, Marathon added 17% and Cipher jumped 40%. But their performance is more complex than that. In addition to their revenue from block rewards about to be cut in half, miners are also facing a steady rise in the network hash rate \u2013 which measures how much computing power the Bitcoin network uses to process transactions and is a key indicator of the network's health. The Bitcoin hash rate has been hitting new all-time highs consistently throughout the year, which is good for the health and security of Bitcoin but tends to hurt miners' revenue. \"There's been more miners that have come to the market with hardware and more people are competing for these coins today than ever before, and that makes the economics for the entire industry challenging,\" Smith said. When it comes to costs, the main one for miners is electricity. Some have a contract with a power producer where they buy a certain amount of power annually at a fixed price. Miners who buy power at spot prices stand to lose from any spike in power prices, often in the summer or winter. Another big cost: hardware. Some miners use older, less efficient mining equipment and may not be able to invest in newer equipment as they juggle other costs and variables. That could be challenging for companies as the halving approaches, but a big enough rally could help. \"If bitcoin goes up or doubles between now and the halving, these machines that I think will be uneconomical at the having could still be economical, and so it really depends on what happens with the price of bitcoin,\" Smith said. \"Roughly 20% of the network is powered by machines that just won't be economical to the next halving so those machines will have to come offline. Depending on who runs them and whether or not that entity has faster machines somewhere else, they may get forced out of the out of the market.\" \u2014CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "content": "Stefan Thomas, the former chief technology officer of Ripple, holds 7,002 bitcoins, currently valued at $244 million, in a hard drive he can no longer access because he misplaced the digital keys.\n\nThe programmer received these bitcoins in 2011 as payment for an educational video he created about bitcoin, only to lose the access code later that same year.\n\nCrypto security specialists at Unciphered have now thrown Thomas a potential lifeline.\n\nThe firm penned an open letter to him on Oct. 25, claiming they have the technical ability to outsmart Thomas\u2019s \u201cIronKey,\u201d the encrypted USB device, and help him gain access to his bitcoin fortune.\n\nYears ago, Thomas misplaced the paper containing his IronKey password, a device that permits only 10 attempts before permanently encrypting its contents.\n\nAfter fruitlessly trying eight of his go-to passwords, he\u2019s down to his last two guesses.\n\nThe drama gained attention in 2021, following a New York Times article detailing how the programmer had just two shots left to reclaim his crypto stash.\n\nUnciphered has claimed it successfully recovered data from an IronKey similar to Thomas\u2019s, also notably accomplishing this feat for digital culture publication Wired.\n\nThey utilized a \u201csecret cracking technique\u201d over months, permitting them more than the standard 10 attempts, Wired reported.\n\nPooling their resources, the company\u2019s founders reportedly assembled a team called Project Everest, comprising roughly 10 members, including staff and external advisors.\n\nNotably, several team members had previously sharpened their skills at the National Security Agency or similar high-profile government entities.\n\nUnciphered is keeping its research methods and the specific technique used to bypass the IronKey\u2019s guess limit under wraps, citing the potential risk associated with exposing such vulnerabilities.\n\nThe firm says this secrecy is necessary since the outdated IronKey models they breached can\u2019t be updated and might still hold sensitive data.\n\nThomas has so far declined Unciphered\u2019s help, per Wired.\n\nBlockworks has reached out to the former Ripple chief technology officer for comment.\n\nHe is said to have already struck a deal with two other cracking teams \u2014 cybersecurity firm Naxo and independent researcher Chris Tarnovsky \u2014 promising them a reward for unlocking the drive.\n\nYet, Naxo\u2019s progress remains uncertain, and Tarnovsky is waiting for some payment from Thomas to continue.\n\nDespite no success so far from the two parties, Thomas appears to be sticking to his original pact, giving the initial teams more leeway before seeking new aid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the current team could decide to subcontract Unciphered if they feel that\u2019s the best option.

        "title": "How Important Would a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF be for the Crypto Industry? - Finance Magnates",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency community has been buzzing over the idea of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset management businesses. An ETF would provide investors with a more convenient and regulated way to obtain exposure to Bitcoin, potentially opening the door to institutional and retail involvement.\n\nBlackRock is a financial powerhouse:\n\nAccording to the most recent available data, BlackRock is a giant in the asset management sector, managing approximately $9 trillion in assets. It has an impact on traditional asset classes such as equities, fixed income, and alternative assets. Given its stature, every move by BlackRock into the crypto field is closely watched and anticipated.\n\nBTC\u2019s Price Action\n\nThe recent surge in Bitcoin's price is captivating the cryptocurrency world, with the digital currency breaking through the crucial $35,000 threshold. After a relatively lackluster performance in early October, Bitcoin's total gains for the month are now approaching an impressive 29%. While BTC is still a long way off from its all-time high of over $69,000 in November 2021, these price spikes have generated significant excitement in the crypto space.\n\nWhat's driving this bullish sentiment? It's primarily tied to the optimism surrounding the potential approval of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by U.S. regulators. Last week, Grayscale filed an application that could enable its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product to operate as a spot Bitcoin ETF. Currently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has only approved cryptocurrency ETFs based on futures contracts, which derive their value from the expected future price of an asset like Bitcoin.\n\nKeep Reading TradingView Enhances DeFi Tools on Polygon via QuickSwap Partnership\n\nIn July, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals made a significant ruling in favor of Grayscale Investments, rejecting the SEC's opposition to turning GBTC into an ETF. Crypto enthusiasts believe this legal victory may open the door to spot Bitcoin ETFs from not only Grayscale but also other financial giants like BlackRock.\n\nThese positive developments have ignited hopes that Bitcoin's extended crypto winter could be thawing. Since the spring of 2022, the crypto market has weathered challenges, from bankruptcies to regulatory hurdles, causing significant turmoil. Now, investors are pondering whether this surge in Bitcoin's price signifies the end of the crypto winter or if it's merely a temporary respite before further price fluctuations.\n\nThe Search for a Bitcoin ETF:\n\nFor years, the notion of a Bitcoin ETF has been circulating, with many proposals from various businesses submitted to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). So yet, however, none have been approved. A Bitcoin ETF would allow investors to purchase shares that symbolize Bitcoin ownership without having to own the cryptocurrency directly. This format appeals to traditional investors who may be wary of the intricacies and security issues associated with holding digital assets.\n\nWhy BlackRock is Important:\n\nBlackRock's entry into the Bitcoin ETF market would be significant for multiple reasons:\n\n1. Credibility and trustworthiness:\n\nBlackRock has a well-established reputation for risk management and adherence to regulatory regulations. The firm's presence in the crypto market would almost certainly give the industry with the credibility and confidence it desperately needs to attract institutional investors. Because of worries about market integrity and regulation, many institutions have been cautious to invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\n2. Broad Adoption:\n\nBlackRock's ETFs have a proven track record of drawing large quantities of cash. A Bitcoin ETF backed by BlackRock has the potential to bring Bitcoin and the larger cryptocurrency market into the mainstream, making it more accessible to a broader variety of investors. This may result in increasing adoption and acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class.\n\n3. Price Discovery and Liquidity:\n\nETFs are well-known for their liquidity, and a Bitcoin ETF would most likely be no different. Increased liquidity may result in better price discovery in the Bitcoin market, decreasing the volatility that has put some investors off. As a result, Bitcoin may become a more appealing alternative for portfolio diversification.\n\n4. Regulatory History:\n\nIf the SEC approves a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, it will set a major regulatory precedent. Other asset managers and financial institutions are likely to follow suit, resulting in an explosion of bitcoin ETFs. This could be a watershed event in the evolution of the cryptocurrency sector.\n\n5. Risk Reduction:\n\nSecurity issues are frequently cited by investors as a barrier to participation into the cryptocurrency market. Investors might acquire exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated and custodied vehicle with a BlackRock-backed ETF, eliminating the risks associated with self-custody and private key management.\n\nUncertainties and Challenges:\n\nWhile the benefits of a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF are obvious, there are several hurdles and unknowns:\n\n1. Regulatory Obstacles:\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has been hesitant in issuing Bitcoin ETFs, citing worries about market manipulation and investor protection. To get approval, BlackRock's proposal would need to address these concerns.\n\n2. Impact on the Nature of Bitcoin:\n\nSome believe that the adoption of an ETF will change Bitcoin's core essence, transforming it from a decentralized digital money to a more controlled and institutionalized asset.\n\n3. Market Influence:\n\nThe issuance of a Bitcoin ETF may result in large price volatility in the cryptocurrency. Investors should brace themselves for possible turmoil.\n\n4. The competition:\n\nIn the battle to develop a Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock will face competition from other financial behemoths such as Fidelity. In this competitive environment, the first-mover advantage could be critical.\n\nThe Verdict: A Game Changer?\n\nA BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has the potential to transform the cryptocurrency industry, ushering in a new era of institutional involvement and widespread adoption. However, it must also manage regulatory obstacles and uncertainty.\n\nUltimately, whether or not a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is approved, the crypto industry is on an unstoppable path toward more acceptance and integration into the regular financial world. The likelihood of a major entity like BlackRock entering the market demonstrates the rising acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class. This breakthrough will be eagerly watched by the crypto community, investors, and regulators alike, as it has the potential to transform the future of finance."

        "content": "Volatility across the crypto derivatives market leaped to fresh local highs this week following a surge led by major blue chip asset bitcoin (BTC).\n\nA two-month period of relatively muted market activity had placed the world\u2019s largest digital asset in relative stasis, trading within a $2,000 range. But on Monday, the market sprang to life, with a 14% rise in the asset\u2019s price topping out at just above $35,000 on Tuesday.\n\nThat activity caused a flush of large leveraged short positions, creating a short squeeze \u2014 short sellers closing out their positions \u201cen mass\u201d \u2014 Bradley Duke, chief strategy officer at ETC Group told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cOnly hindsight will be able to tell us if this rally actually has legs, but it feels like enthusiasm for bitcoin is starting to return,\u201d he said.\n\nOpen interest for bitcoin futures initially tanked on the back of those liquidations, wiping roughly $1 billion from the market. That has since retraced, indicating new contracts are being opened post-rally, according to Aditya Jalan, APAC trading manager at FalconX.\n\nInterestingly, open interest in listed BTC options on Deribit has increased to $13 billion and is now at the highest level in USD terms since the bull market of Q4 2021, Jalan said.\n\nBlockworks was told by several analysts that options trading tends to attract a more professional audience compared to futures trading, leading to fewer retail investors participating in this segment of the crypto market.\n\nConsequently, the incidence of liquidations and declines in open interest are less frequent in options trading compared to futures, crypto algorithmic trading firm Auros said.\n\nImplied volatility over a 30-day period for bitcoin options contracts shows the rally has also pushed the value to its highest point since the end of June, at just above 59%, data from T3\u2019s Bitcoin Volatility Index shows.\n\nTo put that into context, the index has only crossed over that level five times this year.\n\nContributing factors\n\nAccording to Mark Connors, head of research at 3iQ, the recent volatility in the crypto derivatives market can be attributed to a combination of factors.\n\n\u201cHistorically low cold coming into this week and favorable developments in spot BTC events combined to ignite a chase by some market makers to get longer gamma,\u201d Connors said.\n\nThis means that changes in market sentiment occurred more quickly than market makers could adjust their hedges, leading to a shift in open interest across different derivatives vehicles, he said.\n\nConnors emphasized these factors contributed to the surge in BTC price but were not the primary driver behind it.\n\n\u201cWe do not think the options positions drove the spike to $35,000, rather they augmented the move somewhat,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the same time, BlackRock\u2019s proposed iShares Bitcoin ETF, carrying the ticker IBTC, reappeared on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation website after disappearing early on Tuesday.\n\nThe initial listing on the Depository website was attributed by analysts as a catalyst for continued bullish fervor surrounding a potential greenlight of a US bitcoin ETF in the year ahead.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "Bitcoin seems to have emerged from the 2022\u20132023 crypto winter stronger than most, and people are probably wondering, \u201cWhat happens to Bitcoin in 2024?\u201d To which we reply, \u201cBitcoin\u2019s halving event.\u201d\n\nThis handy guide covers pertinent issues such as the next Bitcoin halving dates, is Bitcoin halving good or bad, will Bitcoin halving increase price, and whether halving leads to a Bitcoin supply reduction.\n\nIntroduction to Bitcoin halving\n\nTo get to the bottom of this event, it calls for a comprehensive examination of creating Bitcoin (BTC). Since Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, anyone can generate Bitcoin through the digital mining process.\n\nIt involves using powerful computers to decipher complicated mathematical problems or an encrypted hash via the proof-of-work (PoW) process, which verifies a transaction and adds it to the blockchain. Successful miners receive a pre-established amount of Bitcoin rewards in return.\n\nIn essence, the block subsidy reward received by miners is reduced by 50% as a result of the Bitcoin block reward halving event.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto introduced halving events to keep the Bitcoin inflation rate in check. Reducing the mining rewards reduces the incentive to mine for more, increasing Bitcoin scarcity and raising the stock-to-flow ratio. Furthermore, creating BTC scarcity makes it more precious and aids in retaining and appreciating in value over time, especially if demand continues to rise.\n\nThe history of Bitcoin halving\n\nWhen the Bitcoin network went live in 2009, the mining reward, or Bitcoin mining subsidy, stood at 50 BTC per block. Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, hard-baked the miner rewards reduction protocol into the Bitcoin code as part of its monetary policy.\n\nTherefore, the block subsidy halving code will execute automatically on completion of every 210,000 blocks, slashing rewards granted to miners for the next four years.\n\nSince its launch in 2009, there have been three halving events, with the first occurring in 2012, followed by 2016, and the most recent one in 2020. The fourth halving will, therefore, happen in 2024 at a block height of 840,000, with the fifth projected to materialize in 2028.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving cycle\n\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to determine an exact date or time when the next halving event will occur because it depends on completing 210,000 blocks. Since confirming or adding a new block to the Bitcoin network takes about 10 minutes, the halving schedule is approximately once every four years.\n\nTechnological significance of the Bitcoin halving 2024\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving cycle is significant, as it fosters innovation and resilience in its native cryptocurrency, setting it apart from fiat currency.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving event of 2024 is significant, as it will have an impact on the rate at which new BTC is introduced into the market. The event will result in a decrease in rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, potentially prompting miners to enhance their efficiency. In order to maintain profitability, miners must find ways to optimize their operations as the rewards decrease. This can fuel technological advancement in mining hardware, resulting in the creation of mining rigs that are both more energy-efficient and more powerful.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s capped supply policy ensures no more than 21 million BTC can exist, unlike fiat currencies that are without limit.\n\nEconomic significance of the Bitcoin halving 2024\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving events have historically precipitated the market scarcity of cryptocurrencies, causing upward pressure on prices, explaining the bull runs witnessed after every halving event.\n\nBased on past occurrences, popular social media expert commentator BitQuant predicted that Bitcoin\u2019s price could reach an all-time high before or after the halving event in 2024. This assertion is hardly surprising, considering all past events preceded all-time price highs for Bitcoin. BitQuant speculates that the price could hit an astronomical $250,000 \u2014 nine times its current value.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving timetable in 2024 is crucial after the 2022 crypto winter and the 2023 economic downturn. By slowing BTC creation, it restricts Bitcoin supply over time. Gold-like scarcity applies here. Bitcoin\u2019s deflationary feature attracts investors trying to retain their capital in a world where inflation devalues traditional currencies.\n\nHalving events are predefined, transparent and predictable, unlike central banks\u2019 discretionary judgments in traditional monetary systems. Investors feel secure in this regularity, especially in unpredictable economic times. Bitcoin\u2019s tight monetary policy, enforced by halvings, appeals to people apprehensive of central banks\u2019 actions and policy shifts.\n\nMany gold aficionados perceive Bitcoin as a valuable asset. Gold has always protected against inflation and provided a safe refuge during economic downturns. Bitcoin, in its digital form, has similar traits. Gold investors prefer Bitcoin halvings because they reduce the supply, which is akin to gold mining. The notion of \u201cdigital gold\u201d suggests Bitcoin might serve a comparable role in the digital era. Bitcoin halving occurrences are notable for long-term gold investors since both Bitcoin and gold are deflationary.\n\nImpact of the halving cycle on Bitcoin\u2019s price\n\nSince halving reduces the incentive to mine Bitcoin, it creates scarcity and raises the apt question: Will Bitcoin\u2019s halving increase BTC\u2019s price?\n\nLooking at historical figures from past halving events offers valuable insights, as they\u2019ve all followed a similar pattern. This is mainly due to the decrease in mining rewards and inflation caused by the reduced introduction of new Bitcoin.\n\n1. Amassing phase\n\nBitcoin users typically accumulate BTC pre-halving, causing a stagnation or slight uptrend in Bitcoin prices. This phenomenon preceded the first, second, third and current halving events, lasting between 13 and 22 months.\n\n2. Bull run phase\n\nPast halving events triggered bull market phases lasting 10\u201315 months, with the price rising steadily and attaining all-time highs afterward. Only once (in 2016) did Bitcoin suffer a brief pullback, but it recovered and followed the characteristic bull phase trajectory.\n\n3. Bear run phase\n\nAll the previous bull runs ended in a pullback or price correction phase that lasted about 600 days, although the last one only ran for about a year.\n\nImpact of Bitcoin halving on miners\n\nMining Bitcoin is resource- and energy-intensive. By some estimates, it takes 1,449 kilowatts per hour of electricity to complete a single Bitcoin transaction. That\u2019s the same amount of energy a typical American household will use in 55 days. Halving the rewards for mining Bitcoin will impact miners, as the mining cost remains high, while the rewards dip.\n\nThe industry standard for measuring profitability is in dollars per terahash (TH) per second, which refers to the money generated by a mining rig producing a trillion hashes per second. One can utilize mining calculators to find the hash rate and gauge profitability.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s price is volatile, mining Bitcoin at its peak in 2017 fetched $3.39 per TH/s, but by mid-2022, it had dropped to $0.104 per TH/s. Halving the rewards will further eat into miners\u2019 profitability, so most miners can only hope to make a profit during a bull run.\n\nIs Bitcoin halving good or bad?\n\nBitcoin halving has its pros and cons. For instance, halvings affect the issuance rate of new BTC, creating scarcity, which could drive BTC price appreciation. This comes at the cost of short-term Bitcoin price volatility, which is driven by the uncertainty created by the halving event.\n\nOn the other hand, the Bitcoin halving reduces profitability, meaning miners will earn half of what they were making to confirm new blocks while spending the same amount on computing and energy costs.\n\nThe halving might also negatively impact Bitcoin network security, as fewer miners will be incentivized to continue mining due to reduced profitability. That could theoretically expose the network to a 51% attack, as mining power would consolidate among fewer participants.\n\nWritten by Tanuj Surve"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nUnciphered claims to have developed a method that can crack into IronKey encrypted hard drives.\n\nThe company now wants to demonstrate its technique on a drive owned by f ormer Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas.\n\nThomas famously lost the password to his IronKey, which contains the keys to BTC worth around $240M today.\n\nSo why has he declined Unciphered\u2019s offer?\n\nImagine leaving $240M in a safe only to forget the combination. Now imagine that the safe explodes destroying whatever\u2019s inside it after ten failed attempts at the code. Former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas found himself in precisely this situation when he forgot the password to an IronKey encrypted hard drive that held the private keys to a crypto address containing 7,002 BTC.\n\nNow, more than a decade since his story was first publicized, Unciphered, a company that specializes in helping people just like Thomas, claims to finally have a solution to his exploding safe dilemma.\n\nNo Back Door To IronKey Encryption\n\nFirst developed thanks to a $1.4 million grant from the Department of Homeland Security, IronKey drives are used by government and military officials, intelligence agencies, private businesses, and anyone in possession of valuable secrets for whom data security is tantamount.\n\nGiven the USB drives\u2019 reputation for strong encryption, they have also proven popular among cryptocurrency investors like Thomas, who use them to protect their keys from prying eyes.\n\nDo you require military-grade security? \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f The #KingstonIronKey D500S USB Flash Drive features flagship military-grade security that makes IronKey the most trusted brand to safeguard your classified data. \ud83d\udd10#KingstonIsWithYou pic.twitter.com/h3Hg5cihuJ \u2014 Kingston Technology (@KingstonTechBiz) September 22, 2023\n\nBack in 2021, a spokesperson for Kingston Technology, the company that makes IronKeys, confirmed to TechRadar that even they couldn\u2019t help Thomas recover his private keys.\n\nA company spokesperson explained that Kingston\u2019s complete range of encrypted USB flash drives permits a maximum of 10 password attempts. Beyond this limit, the encryption key erasion occurs, making the data irretrievable. Thomas has already made 8 unsuccessful attempts to guess the code.\n\n\u201cThere is no backup password or alternative method, other than the original password that was set up by the user to retrieve the data,\u201d the Kingston spokesperson said.\n\nUnciphered Wins Race To Crack Digital Safe\n\nSince the company was founded in 2021, Unciphered has already made a name for itself by cracking into popular crypto hardware wallets, including the OneKey and Trezor T models.\n\nBut if breaking into those devices was impressive, there\u2019s a reason the team dubbed their efforts to crack the IronKey \u201cProject Everest.\u201d\n\nMarking a milestone in the history of digital safecracking, Unciphered now claims to have developed a method that allows it to bypass IronKey\u2019s ten-attempt limit, rendering its encryption susceptible to brute-force attacks.\n\nIn an open letter to Thomas, the firm said its technique is the result of months of research by its team of engineers and cryptographers, who have offered to break into his device and recover the $240M Bitcoin keys.\n\n\u201cWe started by reverse engineering all of the inter-chip communication protocols, then the firmware of the controller and cryptographic implementation details, and ultimately pieced together all aspects of how your device works,\u201d the letter stated.\n\nBefore reaching out to Thomas, Unciphered first enlisted the help of a Wired journalist to verify that their method worked.\n\nLo and behold, the company was able to break into an IronKey S200 and gain access to a secret phrase the reporter had stored on the device in order to prove they had done it.\n\nThomas Declines Offer To Unlock $240M Worth Of Bitcoin\n\nWhile most people would leap at the opportunity to unlock $240M worth of Bitcoin, according to Wired, Thomas declined the company\u2019s offer before they even got around to discussing fees or commission.\n\nApparently, the former Ripple CTO has already made a deal with two other cracking teams and has promised to split a portion of the locked-up Bitcoin between them if they succeed in breaking his IronKey\u2019s encryption.\n\nFor now, it seems as if Thomas is happy to honor his word and wait to unlock his private keys. But his story teaches an important lesson: just because a security challenge is insurmountable today, doesn\u2019t mean it will be forever.\n\nWhen Thomas was first locked out of his IronKey, the Bitcoin it controlled access to was worth $140,000. No small sum, but significantly less than its current value. Thankfully, he kept the drive safe for all those years and may soon be able to reap the rewards of his patience."

        "content": "Bitcoin Dominance Surges to 54% as Halving Approaches\n\nBitcoin's market dominance has reached a 30-month high of 54%, indicating the top cryptocurrency's growing strength leading up to the halving event in April 2024.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving occurs every four years, reducing the mining reward per block and lowering the influx of new Bitcoin into the market. With the next halving, the reward will be cut from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.\n\nAs Bitcoin's supply growth slows while demand rises, its dominance increases. Bitcoin maintained over 80% dominance in the 2017 bull market, but it fell to the 50-60% range in the 2021 bull run.\n\nNow, ETF excitement and the halving event have brought its dominance back up to 54%, the highest level since April 2021. The rise coincided with Bitcoin rallying above $30,000 amid news of a potential spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the US.\n\nNoelle Acheson, a market analyst, says Bitcoin's safe-haven appeal and ETF momentum have helped boost its dominance over altcoins like ether. She notes Bitcoin tends to lead in early market cycles before investors get more comfortable with higher-risk assets.\n\nWith Bitcoin beating most altcoins in recent performance, its bullish momentum could signal an eventual altcoin rally once money begins flowing from Bitcoin into other crypto assets. For now, its dominance reflects its strength as the crypto market awaits the next major catalyst."

        "content": "The Bitcoin (BTC) rally, which had stalled two months back after making a solid turnaround earlier this year, once again rebounded on Oct 24. The cryptocurrency jumped nearly 6% to $34,872 to hit its highest level in almost one-and-a-half years on growing speculation that Blackrock\u2019s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) will soon be a reality.\n\nTuesday\u2019s rally followed a 10% surge in Bitcoin on Oct 23, when it crossed the $35,000 mark. The enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin sent other related stocks and major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) on a rally. Ethereum prices jumped 4.5% on Oct 23 to $1,786.30, hitting its highest level since August.\n\nInvestors Optimist about Bitcoin ETF\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to boost demand as it would enable more conservative investors to own Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies via traditional stock markets.\n\nThe approval is also likely to attract new investments into the crypto sector, which could further boost demand.\n\nCryptocurrencies made a solid rebound in 2023 after suffering majorly last year as the Federal Reserve launched an aggressive monetary tightening campaign to curb multi-decade high inflation, which saw the central bank hiking interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022.\n\nMoreover, a couple of unfortunate events, the Terra Luna crash and a major fraud leading to the bankruptcy of FTX, saw a slump in the crypto market.\n\nCryptocurrencies staged a solid rebound this year, with Bitcoin hitting $31,000 in early July before the rally came to a halt. Bitcoin price has since been rangebound and hovering around the $25,000 mark as investors struggled to gauge the Fed\u2019s next move with its interest rate hike policy.\n\nHowever, renewed optimism among investors sent Bitcoin prices up last week after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decided not to appeal its loss against Grayscale Investments in the D.C. Circuit court.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeculation is now rife that the modification made to the Registration Statement for the Ishares Bitcoin Trust, submitted to the SEC on Oct 18, suggests that Blackrock might buy Bitcoin this month to provide initial capital for its upcoming spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis definitely bodes well for the crypto market.\n\nOur Choices\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is a phenomenal success story. The numbers behind it are truly eye-popping. For example, between 2010 and 2022 Bitcoin provided average annual returns of 1,576% and a total return of 18,7912%.\n\nIts market capitalization of $602 billion accounts for approximately 60% of the total capital in the entire cryptocurrency market. Despite some spectacular scams, crypto is here to stay and many incredible projects that will solve real problems are currently being built.\n\nThus, crypto investors are bound to continue to search for \u201cthe next Bitcoin.\u201d To find those returns look for utility and integration into the wider financial system. That\u2019s the key.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQuant (QNT-USD)\n\nThe logo for the Quant cryptocurrency network is displayed in white on a black background.\n\nSource: Zeedign.com / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuant (QNT-USD) has defined utility as the focal point of its development. It is working to facilitate interoperability between multiple blockchains. In essence, Quant connects individual blockchains through decentralized applications (dApps). dApps are Web 3.0 apps in a sense and allow users to interface with blockchains. Quant is facilitating a big idea that\u2019s difficult to fathom completely but remains one that is hugely important nonetheless.\n\nAnother thing to note about Quant and the other cryptos listed below is that all are ISO 20022 compliant. ISO 20022 is a global standardization body that governs commercial and industrial standards. In this case, those related to financial system integration. By 2025, all financial institutions must be able to process ISO compliant payment transactions. Quant is going to be mainstream and investors should realize that and act accordingly.\n\nInteroperability is the name of the game. Cryptocurrency is still in its Wild West phase but ISO 20022 compliance and integration will bring those that meet the standard into the mainstream of finance.\n\nHedera (HBAR-USD)\n\nConcept tokens for Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) on a black keyboard.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHedera (HBAR-USD) has established an important first-mover advantage that makes it part of the conversation to identify the next Bitcoin. It has become deeply associated with enterprise utility. Corporations moved into crypto during the pandemic to varying degrees and continue to integrate crypto today. Hedera is among the first names that enterprises will think of as crypto opportunities increase. When it comes time to add functionality, Hedera has that opportunity because it laid the groundwork.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is also ISO 20022 compliant which only strengthens that narrative. Larger financial institutions are developing crypto businesses in house. Hedera may not have a great opportunity to break into those enterprises. However, SMEs don\u2019t have as many resources as the big banks do. Sooner or later, they\u2019re going to seek crypto integration and functionality en masse. That is among the best reasons to invest in Hedera overall. The project is preparing for fintech opportunities that are being established by the day. Hedera\u2019s ISO 20022 compliance is a crystal clear example of its goals and direction and shouldn\u2019t be ignored.\n\nCardano (ADA-USD)\n\nCardano crypto logo\n\nSource: RuskaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nCardano (ADA-USD) has also ticked the ISO 20022 compliance box. Cardano is being developed with the goal of long-term success as its primary purpose. Long-term success means a reliance on computer science and empirical evidence to guide its development. Unsexy stuff at its heart. Perhaps that\u2019s why Cardano doesn\u2019t get much attention overall. It\u2019s the polar opposite of meme coin nonsense and aims to build utility first and foremost.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine that the developers at Cardano understand that the game is really about wider integration. Cardano, and any other long-term winners, are going to win by being part of the evolution of money. That means development ultimately is evolution and integration into the financial system, not a wholesale replacing of the financial system. I\u2019m sure that the empirical evidence draws similar conclusions. Cardano is sure to listen and that\u2019s why it\u2019s got a great chance of winning in the long term.\n\nIt may not exactly fit the ideal frame of \u201cthe next Bitcoin\u201d in that Cardano\u2019s value can\u2019t realistically increase to $28k. It currently trades for less than 30 cents. However, it does have the potential to grow over the next decade like Bitcoin did from 2010-2020.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Bitcoin soars amid buzz of potential ETF approval: Is a crypto renaissance on the horizon? - Forkast News",
        "content": "In this issue\n\nETF price pump Ethereum NFTs on the up Working blues\n\nFrom the Editor\u2019s Desk Dear Reader, It\u2019s not like it came out of nowhere. We\u2019ve known for some time about the potential for a spot Bitcoin ETF bounce and the buzz it can bring back to the crypto industry. But what many were unprepared for was the huge surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price over the past week. Briefly topping US$35,000 during Tuesday trading, Bitcoin is up around 23% for the past 7 days as we go to print. It started Oct. 16. Crypto media picked up on a post claiming the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved an application by investment giant BlackRock to create a spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund for the U.S., the world\u2019s largest economy. Bitcoin\u2019s price shot up nearly 10% to around US$30,000 before tracing back the gains when it was revealed the post was a fake. But the buzz was real. Confirmation of a win for digital asset investment firm Grayscale over the SEC then filtered through on Monday, Oct. 23, electrifying the market. The SEC, the regulator announced, will not contest Grayscale\u2019s right to convert its GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) into a spot Bitcoin ETF. SEC head Gary Gensler confirms that the regulator is currently considering \u201ceight to ten\u201d of these spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Among those are applications from some of the biggest investment names out there. The consensus is that once one application is approved, the rest will follow. While obstacles remain \u2014 not least that the SEC may well find another way to oppose the creation of a spot Bitcoin ETF as a new financial instrument \u2014 the Grayscale announcement was seen as a major win for crypto. And don\u2019t we all need a win about now? A spot Bitcoin ETF will allow investors to trade the coin on regular stock exchanges. That\u2019s a big deal. Many think it will open the door for a multibillion dollar inflow of institutional cash into the Bitcoin market. But those gains aren\u2019t in the bag yet and we should temper our excitement over what is still a complicated process. Even if a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF is approved and the bounce returns to the market\u2019s step, the wider industry needs to capitalize and make the most of that momentum. Perhaps then, after what has been a truly rough 18 months, the industry can return to its previous heights and beyond. Until the next time, Angie Lau,\n\nFounder and Editor-in-Chief\n\nForkast.News\n\n1. ETF price pump\n\nBitcoin surges past $35,000 after Grayscale\u2019s GBTC conversion gets a nod. Image: Canva\n\nWith one announcement Monday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may have inched closer to green-lighting a U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The belief is that once one such ETF is approved, others will follow, catalyzing institutional investment in the blockchain industry.\n\nThis sentiment was bolstered as the SEC announced it won\u2019t challenge Grayscale\u2019s conversion of its GBTC into a spot Bitcoin ETF. The news contributed to a 10% spike in Bitcoin\u2019s price, briefly sending the coin above US$35,000 for the first time since May 2022.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s GBTC, with assets worth $16.7 billion, is currently the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fund. Following the SEC announcement, the company expressed its readiness and eagerness to transition GBTC into a Bitcoin ETF, emphasizing a commitment to its investors.\n\nThe introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF is expected to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the relatively niche cryptocurrency market. As Jack Jia of Unlimit highlighted, such ETFs will streamline the investment process for potential crypto investors, making the onboarding process smoother via traditional brokers.\n\nHeavyweight financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest are also in the queue, having submitted their applications to the SEC. Historically, the SEC has shown reluctance to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, voicing concerns about crypto market liquidity and potential price manipulation.\n\nVivian Fang, a finance professor and fintech expert, feels the SEC is becoming more receptive to the idea, especially given its recent acknowledgments of the Bitcoin market\u2019s resilience to potential manipulation.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? There is a certain irony that the SEC is now \u201cwarming up,\u201d as Vivian Fang put it, to the idea of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The Grayscale announcement arrived only a week after the fake BlackRock ETF news originally sent Bitcoin\u2019s price skyrocketing after months of losses and inactivity across crypto. The SEC\u2019s reasoning for now entertaining the idea of a spot Bitcoin ETF is that the Bitcoin market is sufficiently mature and large enough to protect investors from manipulation and overnight fluctuations in price. But the fake BlackRock announcement has, to some extent, shown that argument to be porous. Total transaction volume in the wider crypto market is still way down from its bull market heights, while Bitcoin\u2019s dominance of that market is now 53%. Whether or not the fake news post about BlackRock\u2019s successful ETF bid was a deliberate attempt at market manipulation, or simply a prank gone wrong, the effect was still a manipulation of the market. To the tune of US$100 million in BTC liquidations over the course of 30 minutes, to be exact. Will that now impact the SEC\u2019s thinking? Is governance and general reporting standards surrounding crypto robust enough to justify a spot Bitcoin ETF \u2014 a financial instrument expected to finally entice the mountains of institutional cash we\u2019ve all been waiting for into the industry? The moneypeople holding the purse strings seem to think so. At least \u201c8 to 10\u201d major investment funds are, according to Gary Gensler, in line to make that bet. BlackRock, it was revealed on Monday, has had a ticker for its spot Bitcoin ETF listed online since August. However, in the days since the ticker\u2019s existence was first discovered, the listing has been taken down, only to then be restored. While this may be nothing, and the existence of a ticker itself could just be part of the application process rather than anything concrete, what it does show is that we shouldn\u2019t take anything for granted.\n\n2. Ethereum NFTs on the up\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT Index is up 6.28% in the past seven days. Ethereum NFT sales volume is up 43.40%, hitting US$45.6 million in the week.\n\nAverage Sale price of Ethereum NFTs climbed to US$389.74 on Oct. 24, the highest it\u2019s been since average sale prices reached US$429.36 on July 13.\n\nIt was a 63-day high for Ethereum NFT sales, its highest mark since Aug. 22, when sales reached US$8.9 million.\n\nETH price climbed 13.70% in the past seven days to US$1,788.29, helping to drive up the price of NFTs on the network, which are denominated by the cryptocurrency.\n\nForkast.Insights | What does it mean? Many cryptocurrencies are reaching yearly highs this week and Ether seems to be on its way to similar heights. The sudden increase in Ether\u2019s price has brought the value of NFTs up along with it, and the excitement surrounding the movement is also driving sales volume. Traders who believe that crypto prices will continue to climb may be tempted to purchase some of the top NFT collections, most of which have been at all-time low prices. In the past seven days, multiple collections saw their floor price climb considerably. That includes Doodles (+34%), Nakamigos (+27%), CloneX (+23%), Milady Maker (+22%), and Azuki (+19%). So-called profile picture (PFP) collections benefited the most from this surge in trading. Bored Ape Yacht Club (US$6 million), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (US$2.5 million), and CryptoPunks (US$2.4 million) NFTs claimed 3 of the top 4 spots in the NFT collection rankings by sales volume on CryptoSlam.io. NFT sales and value increasing on Ethereum also has a correlation to declining sales on the social finance platform, Friend.tech. On Oct. 24, over US$7.6 million worth of keys were sold on FriendTech, the same day Ethereum NFTs hit their 63-day high of US$8.01 million in sales. With Yuga Labs\u2019 Ape Fest 2024 taking place in Hong Kong next week, hype around NFTs will be in full force in the Asia markets. Anticipation that the SEC may approve a U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF should also continue to drive NFT trading action. Many traders are now hoping to see sustained growth throughout the rest of the year.\n\n3. Working blues\n\nAmid a 63% plunge in global crypto market cap, major blockchain firms like Parity, announce workforce reductions. Image: Parity/Canva\n\nParity Technologies, the developer of the Polkadot blockchain, is cutting around 30% of its workforce, primarily targeting marketing and business development sectors.\n\n\n\nParity CEO Bj\u00f6rn Wagner told Bloomberg via a spokesperson that the company aims to allow affected employees to continue contributing to Polkadot. Wagner said that Parity\u2019s financial health and regulatory engagement \u201cremains robust.\u201d\n\nPolkadot\u2019s DOT token has a market value of US$5.35 billion and is ranked 15th in market cap among cryptocurrencies.\n\nThis wave of layoffs comes as the global crypto market capitalization plunged 63% from its all-time high. Widespread staffing reductions have become a trend in the crypto sector throughout this year, reflecting continued bear market conditions.\n\nEarlier in August, blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis announced it is shedding 15% of its 900 staff members, marking its second round of layoffs this year.\n\nBinance.US, the American subsidiary of global cryptocurrency exchange Binance, announced last month that it had cut one-third of its workforce.\n\nBlockchain and cryptocurrency developers like Polygon Labs and Circle have also announced job cuts over the course of the past year."

        "title": "Bitcoin is now worth over $34,500 \u2014 but will it hold? - TechCrunch",
        "content": "The price of bitcoin has always been a closely monitored datapoint in the world of digital currencies given that it\u2019s pretty much the touchstone for cryptocurrencies. And this week, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price shot above $34,500 per token, further cementing its position at the top of the pile.\n\nAt the time of publication, one bitcoin was worth around $34,800, up 23.4% on the week and 109% from $16,625 at the beginning of the year, according to CoinMarketCap. On Monday, the cryptocurrency almost reached $35,000, marking its highest price since May 2022, when the Terra/LUNA collapse led to a sharp decline in the value of most digital tokens.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price had been rising \u201cvery smoothly for eight weeks, suggesting an accumulation phase, and early last week, it fired off several important bull market transition signals at once,\u201d Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro senior market analyst, told TechCrunch+. \u201cThese signals provided an opportunity to break through the 50-day moving average . . . These bullish victories attract a wide range of investors and traders to focus on these signals.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is cheering these gains, though. The recent run has been the \u201cperfect storm\u201d for market participants who have been shorting bitcoin, John Glover, chief investment officer at Ledn, said.\n\nWhat is driving the hike?\n\nThe primary driver of this week\u2019s price moves has been the anticipation and \u201chigh likelihood of the approval\u201d of a bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at Alt Tab Capital.\n\nThere has been ample market speculation around a possible bitcoin spot ETF and the potential such a fund holds for unlocking new demand for bitcoin itself. More demand could lead to rising prices since the supply of bitcoin is limited, and some traders may be working to get ahead of any future value gains.\n\nMany traditional financial players aren\u2019t allowed to trade spot market cryptocurrencies yet, due to regulation and compliance matters. So they do it through other regulated products like bitcoin futures.\n\nThere is a belief that a bitcoin spot ETF will allow for much pent-up institutional interest to flow in through these ETFs, Bradley Duke, chief strategy officer at crypto ETP provider ETC Group, said. \u201cThis will put upward pressure on the price of bitcoin.\u201d\n\nStill, the road to a bitcoin spot ETF has been bumpy. Last week, a false report surfaced of BlackRock\u2019s ETF application being approved, which caused a slight pump in the value of bitcoin.\n\nAnd earlier this week, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, posted on X (formerly Twitter) that BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust was listed on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which clears NASDAQ trades. While this seemed like a new development (and helped drive bullish sentiment), the ticket has actually been posted on DTCC since August; most people just didn\u2019t notice it until recently.\n\nOn Monday, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals closed the June 2022 suit between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and digital asset manager Grayscale, with a final ruling that ordered the government agency to rescind its rejection of the firm\u2019s bitcoin spot ETF application. The court of appeals had ruled in favor of Grayscale back in August, calling the SEC\u2019s denial of the product \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d\n\nAccording to Stefan Rust, CEO of independent inflation data aggregator Truflation, the ETF futures trading volume on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has been going up as a result of investors betting on the spot ETF being approved.\n\nThere are other factors at play, too\n\nWhile a potential bitcoin spot ETF is the most obvious factor driving up the cryptocurrency\u2019s price, there\u2019s more going on here. Some traders anticipate bitcoin\u2019s price to increase in line with historical patterns leading up to bitcoin halving, which happens roughly every four years and is due in about late April 2024.\n\nThe institutional market has also increasingly been accepting of bitcoin \u2014 outside of pending spot ETF approvals. Earlier this week, FTSE Russell launched a joint crypto index business with Grayscale to help grow institutional education and adoption in the space, Fiona Bassett, CEO of FTSE Russell, and Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale, shared at a private dinner on Monday that TechCrunch+ attended.\n\nStill, all this excitement around bitcoin spot ETFs is somewhat reminiscent of what happened in 2017, when the expansion of crypto products and services to institutions did not translate into a price spike, Kuptsikevich said. \u201cAnd now, it could be that the influx of new money into cryptocurrencies from launching a new instrument is overrated, and many companies interested in bitcoin already have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe market positioning \u2014 a lot of outright shorts coupled with a lot of negative gamma \u2014 was a big contributor to this [moving] higher in price,\u201d Glover said.\n\nIn simple terms, negative gamma is a result of traders selling options. As the spot bitcoin price moves higher, those with negative gamma will be forced to buy bitcoin to hedge themselves, and those who don\u2019t will be liquidated on an exchange, Glover added.\n\n\u201cOnce the market began to recognize the size of positions of those who are outright short or had negative gamma, we started to see sustained buying in the market,\u201d Glover said. \u201cThis was exacerbated by the retail participants coming back in as the posts of the likelihood of a sooner-rather-than-later approval for all of these BTC ETFs started hitting the market.\u201d\n\nGoing forward\n\nAs with any asset class, it is always hard to know what is simply short-term bullish sentiment or a sustainable bull run, Duke said. \u201cOnly time will tell.\u201d\n\nBut any time the market has moved upward sharply, some retracement is likely, Silberberg said. \u201cThat remains true in this case. However, we expect to continue to see higher lows during price fluctuations, as overall market enthusiasm has increased.\u201d\n\nIn the near term, market players think bitcoin\u2019s price is likely to retract within the next week or two, unless more bullish news comes out regarding spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing people say that this is the beginning of the bullish cycle,\u201d Glover said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a bull cycle since November of last year, when BTC hit sub-$16K. This is just the next leg up in the cycle.\u201d\n\nGlover believes this upward movement is sustainable given the recent historical data over the past 11 months, and expects bitcoin to hit $45,000 in the coming months based on his weekly technical analysis. Still, he noted that \u201cmarkets never move in a straight line and we will see pullbacks in the price action.\u201d\n\nRust feels this is the beginning of a \u201ccrypto spring\u201d that will give the market a signal to move on from the prolonged winter it has been foundering in."

        "title": "10 Easy Ways to Get Bitcoins in 2024 - Influencer Marketing Hub",
        "content": "Developed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, Bitcoin is the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency. It has increased in value from $0.30 to $16,811 today, with its highest recorded value being $69,000 in November 2021. Only 21 million bitcoins exist, and currently, there are 19 million bitcoins in circulation.\n\nAs exciting as Bitcoin may sound, it is a very risky investment. Its value is highly speculative and extremely volatile. So before investing in or acquiring bitcoins, make sure to learn as much as you can about it and understand the risks involved.\n\n10 Easy Ways to Get Bitcoins in 2024:\n\nWhere to Get Bitcoins\n\nThere are two main ways to get bitcoin: buy them or earn them.\n\nWhen buying bitcoins, you exchange real-world money (called fiat currency) for cryptocurrency. To do so, you can purchase bitcoins via these channels:\n\nCryptocurrency Exchanges\n\nInvestment Brokerage Firms\n\nPayment services like Paypal\n\nOffline services like Bitcoin ATMs\n\nPeer-to-peer exchanges\n\nThere are also numerous ways to get bitcoins without spending actual money. You only need to trade your time and use computer resources. Here are some quick ways to get bitcoin for free:\n\nPlaying mobile games that pay in bitcoins\n\nMining Bitcoins\n\nAccepting bitcoins as payment for rendered services\n\nWriting about Bitcoins and becoming a topic expert\n\nUsing a bitcoin faucet.\n\nUnderstanding the Bitcoin Wallet\n\nBefore you can start buying and spending bitcoins, you need to have a bitcoin wallet. It\u2019s like a physical wallet where you keep actual currencies. In reality, bitcoin wallets only store the encrypted keys of your bitcoins. You use these keys to access your actual bitcoins, which are located as part of the blockchain.\n\nThere are two general kinds of bitcoin wallets:\n\nHot Wallets\n\nThink of hot wallets as online wallets that run on the internet. You can access them on any device that has an internet connection. Hot wallets are convenient and easily accessible\u2014they allow for quick Bitcoin transactions.\n\nHowever, they\u2019re vulnerable to attacks, so it\u2019s best to avoid using them to store large amounts of bitcoins. You should also protect your wallet with good security measures such as strong passwords, safe browsing settings, and two-factor authentications.\n\nCold Wallets\n\nCold wallets, on the other hand, are offline wallets. It is not connected to the internet and can be stored on any device or physical location. They can be as simple as a piece of paper where the encrypted keys are printed or as complex as USB devices that are virus-proof.\n\nCold wallets are not easily accessible to hackers and can serve as a safer way to store a large amount of bitcoins. You can keep them in a secure place that\u2019s accessible only to you, such as safety deposit boxes.\n\nOn the downside, cold wallets are not easily accessible and can be complicated to set up. It would also be hard to retrieve if you lose it or forget where you\u2019ve kept it. Use cold wallets for storing bitcoins that you don\u2019t intend to trade or spend. Also, keep the paper or device in a location that you can easily access and remember.\n\nFive Common Ways to Get Bitcoins\n\nThe fastest way to get bitcoins is to buy them using fiat currencies. You can do these through the following channels.\n\nCryptocurrency Exchange\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges are marketplaces where sellers and buyers trade bitcoins for fiat money (real currencies) or other digital currencies (other cryptocurrencies). They are similar to stockbrokers and can either be centralized or decentralized. They provide tools within their platform that allow you to easily and conveniently trade bitcoins.\n\nPros:\n\nIt\u2019s quick and easy to setup an account.\n\nYou automatically get a cryptocurrency wallet where you can store your bitcoin.\n\nThere are many platforms to choose from, allowing for competitive rates and fees.\n\nSome platforms offer insurance for potential failures on their end like a security breach.\n\nCons:\n\nCentralized exchanges are prone to hacking, since they use private servers in a central location.\n\nIt\u2019s possible for your wallet to be exposed to hackers.\n\nYou don\u2019t own the keys to the wallet they provide. It\u2019s advisable to still keep a separate wallet for storing large sums of bitcoin.\n\nIn the case of decentralized exchanges, it can be used for any means including illegal uses.\n\nPopular Platforms: Coinbase, Binance US, Gemini, Kraken\n\nThings to Consider When Choosing A Cryptocurrency Exchange:\n\nReputation of the platform (Is it highly trusted?)\n\nTransaction fees and other associated fees (Are they economical?)\n\nSecurity of the exchange (Do they provide some form of insurance in case of breach?)\n\nWallet storage (Are you allowed to transfer your bitcoins to a personal bitcoin wallet?)\n\nEase of using the platform (Are they easy to use especially for beginners?)\n\nHow to Get Started:\n\nChoose a trading platform. For beginners, we recommend going to popular and established ones. Create an account by providing all the required information and wait for it to be approved. Once approved, fund your account using your bank account, credit card or debit card. Exchange the funds for bitcoins. Some exchanges offer an easy BUY NOW button. Some offer more advanced options. Once you\u2019ve purchased your bitcoins, the exchange will take care of storing them. In case you want to move it to your personal wallet, simply initiate a transfer.\n\nInvestment Brokerage Firms\n\nDue to the rise of cryptocurrencies, some traditional investment firms already offer bitcoin together with stocks, bonds, options, and other financial products as investment assets. These are accessible through online portals and easily traded on a smartphone just like traditional stocks.\n\nPros:\n\nMost investment firms don\u2019t charge commissions for successful trades.\n\nYou can use the platform to trade other types of investment assets.\n\nSome firms, like eToro, allow you to copy successful trades of other users.\n\nCons:\n\nOnly a handful of investment brokerage firms handle bitcoin trading.\n\nThese platforms don\u2019t have an online wallet to store bitcoins. You need to create a separate wallet outside the platform.\n\nCryptocurrency investments are not protected by SIPC (Securities Investor Protection Corporation) unlike other investment products.\n\nPopular Platforms: Robinhood, eToro\n\nHow to Get Started:\n\nChoose an investment brokerage firm. Sign up for an account on their website and provide the required details. Verify your identity. Fund your account using your debit card or bank account. Begin trading.\n\nPayment Services\n\nWith the popularity of Bitcoin, payment services like Paypal, Venmo and CashApp now allow users to buy, sell, and hold bitcoins. If you have cash earnings stored in these apps, you can use them to purchase bitcoins.\n\nPros:\n\nYou don\u2019t need to create a separate account on a crypto exchange platform or an investment brokerage platform.\n\nYou can buy bitcoins for as low as $1 making it easy to get started and learn more about cryptocurrency.\n\nYou can earn cashback in the form of bitcoins.\n\nCashApp allows users to earn bitcoins for every purchase made with their app.\n\nSome credit card companies offer Bitcoin reward cards that let you earn back bitcoins from purchases made with the card.\n\nCons:\n\nSome third-party providers do not accept Paypal as a means of purchasing bitcoins.\n\nPayment services charge hefty fees especially when purchasing using a credit card.\n\nBitcoins purchased and stored in a Paypal wallet cannot be transferred to another online wallet.\n\nPopular Platforms: Paypal, CashApp, Venmo\n\nHow to Get Started:\n\nCheck your current payment platform if they already offer bitcoin purchases. If they do, follow the process for purchasing bitcoin. For most payment providers, it\u2019s as simple as clicking the BUY button. Make sure your account is funded. You can purchase bitcoins for as low as $1. The payment provider takes care of automatic conversions.\n\nBitcoin ATM Machines\n\nBitcoin ATM machines are like cash ATM machines. You can deposit and withdraw cash as you buy and sell bitcoins. You visit a physical place where these machines are located and insert cash into the machine. You use the inserted cash to purchase bitcoins that are transferred to an online wallet.\n\nPros:\n\nMachines are easily accessible.\n\nThey accept cash which means you don\u2019t need to link banking information. This is helpful for people who don\u2019t use formal banking systems.\n\nThey are convenient and immediate. You can immediately buy or sell bitcoins using these machines.\n\nNewer machines have started dispensing cash in exchange for selling bitcoins.\n\nCons:\n\nThese machines charge hefty fees like a purchase fee and a conversion fee that are way higher than what crypto exchanges charge.\n\nRecently, they have started requiring government-issued IDs before a transaction can be completed. This eliminates the anonymity these machines once offered.\n\nApps for Finding Bitcoin ATMs: Coin ATM Radar, LibertyX, CoinMap\n\nHow to Get Started:\n\nCreate a bitcoin wallet and have the details ready. You can take note of the wallet\u2019s alphanumeric code or simply download the QR code . Visit the nearest Bitcoin ATM machine. Create an account with the ATM operator. Enter your bitcoin wallet information. Insert cash into the machine. The machine will automatically compute how much bitcoin is equivalent to the cash you inserted. This is based on the prevailing value of bitcoin plus the machine\u2019s fees. Review your transaction. The machine will display how much bitcoin you\u2019ve bought and the fees they charged. Confirm the transaction. The bitcoins will be deposited to your bitcoin wallet.\n\nP2P Exchanges\n\nAnother way to get bitcoins is by using peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange networks. These are direct connections between the buyer and seller.\n\nPros:\n\nYou can search for the best deals offered by different sellers.\n\nMost P2P exchange platforms have trust rating systems, so you can vouch for the reputation of the seller.\n\nYou enjoy very low transaction fees, since transactions are conducted directly between buyer and seller.\n\nYour private information is protected, given how P2P exchange platforms don\u2019t collect private information from both buyer and seller.\n\nPayment methods are flexible. Sellers can choose how to get paid and buyers can choose how to pay for purchases.\n\nCons:\n\nSlow trading speeds. The seller may decide to delay the transaction for various reasons.\n\nProne to fraud. While most P2P exchanges have security measures against fraud, it\u2019s still possible that fraudulent sellers and buyers exist in the platform.\n\nP2P platforms don\u2019t have an inherent bitcoin wallet to store your bitcoins. You need to create a separate wallet to store your bitcoins.\n\nPopular Platforms: LocalBitcoins, BinanP2P\n\nHow to Get Started:\n\nCreate an account on a P2P platform. Browse seller posts and decide on a trade you like. Contact the seller. Most platforms have a buy button that allows you to specify how much bitcoin you want to buy. Pay for the purchased bitcoins using your preferred payment method. Send proof of payment to the seller. At this point, the platform holds in escrow the bitcoin you purchased. Once the seller confirms payment, the bitcoin is released to your bitcoin wallet. In case of disputes, you can contact the P2P platform. Most have customer support to settle disputes.\n\nFree Ways to Get Bitcoin\n\nUsing real money and buying bitcoins is not the only way to get bitcoins. If you have the time to allot to it, you can get bitcoins for free.\n\nThere are many ways to do this. The most popular and easiest ones are listed below.\n\nLearning About Cryptocurrency\n\nDid you know that by simply expanding your knowledge about cryptocurrency, you can earn free bitcoins? Coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency website, rewards you with cryptos for every knowledge course you finish.

Check out Coinbase Earn to learn more.\n\nPlaying Online Games\n\nSome online games available in the market reward players with small amounts of bitcoins as prizes. This encourages players to keep playing and even watch ads.\n\nThe more players participate in these games, the more companies are encouraged to show ads in exchange for bitcoins. However, be warned. Most of the prizes are really very low.\n\nBitcoin Rewards Website\n\nBitcoin has become a popular reward for doing various odd tasks. There are websites that will give you free bitcoin in exchange for completing various tasks, such as answering surveys, testing website functionalities, taking quizzes, and so forth.\n\nThe rewards may be small but they add up over time.\n\nBecoming a Bitcoin Expert\n\nIf you learn a lot about bitcoin, you can start writing about it.

Bear in mind that accepting bitcoins as a form of payment is taxable in some countries. Be sure to review your tax laws to make sure you\u2019re compliant.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe world of cryptocurrency is a brand-new avenue for all of us. It has gained a lot of momentum and traction in the past years and more people are already open to the possibilities it brings.\n\nHowever, investing in cryptocurrencies, including bitcoins, is risky. They are highly volatile, and despite having huge gains today, their values may plummet tomorrow. You should always exercise caution when dealing with bitcoins.\n\nBut if you already understand the risks and are willing to take them, you can explore the numerous paid and free ways to get bitcoins. It\u2019s evident that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. So, if you can get your head in the game, now is the right time to do so."

        "title": "Bitcoin Now Up Over 110% This Year In Anticipation of Spot ETF Approval And Halving - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Bitcoin has risen over 110% in 2023 at the time of writing, where the price of the asset started the year off at $16,677 on January 1, has now pumped to above $35,000 only 10 months later. With more room to run this year as hype builds in the market around the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC and the upcoming halving event, many are now questioning if this is the end of this cycle's eventful bear market.\n\nSince the few disastrous incidents that happened in the bear market causing the price drop, things are now looking more optimistic. As some of the worlds largest asset managers, including Fidelity, VanEck and WisdomTree, have filed in hopes to be the first in the United States to get approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. One name in particular though is making more headlines than the rest, and that is the worlds largest asset manger BlackRock, who manages about $10 trillion.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently made an appearance on Fox Business stating that their clients around the world are interested in getting exposure to Bitcoin, saying the recent price rally has been a \"flight to quality.\" Earlier this month, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their approval odds for a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC to 90% by January 10, 2024.\n\nThe next Bitcoin having is expected to take place in roughly 180 days in late April, 2024. The event will see the Bitcoin block reward drop from 6.25 BTC per block to only 3.125 BTC. This will be the fourth halving in Bitcoin's history, with the first happening in November 2012, the second happened in July 2016, and the third happened in May 2020. Historically, a year leading up to and after the halving, the price of BTC goes up substantially.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Should You Buy Coinbase Stock on Higher Bitcoin Prices? - Nasdaq",
        "content": "Valued at $18.45 billion by market cap, Coinbase Global (COIN) is among the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Coinbase went public in 2021, and currently trades 79% below all-time highs.\n\nHowever, COIN has staged a remarkable comeback year-to-date, rising 114% in the first 10 months of 2023 - with recent gains fueled by fresh regulatory optimism for cryptocurrencies.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nMeanwhile, with none other than fund manager Cathie Wood taking advantage of the recent rally to unload her shares, let\u2019s see whether Coinbase stock is worth buying on the latest headlines.\n\nCoinbase Stock Lags Bitcoin's Price Surge\n\nThe performance of Coinbase is closely tied to key cryptocurrency asset prices, such as Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and Ethereum (ETHUSD), which account for a majority of the exchange's trading volumes. Generally, trading volumes are higher in a bull market, allowing Coinbase to benefit from higher fees and commissions. Alternatively, volumes drop when sentiment turns bearish, resulting in lower revenue.\n\nFor instance, Coinbase increased sales from $533.7 million in 2019 to $7.83 billion in 2021 as cryptocurrency prices exploded higher. But in the last 12 months, its sales have fallen to $2.7 billion, with Bitcoin currently trading about 50% below all-time highs.\n\nA key driver for the recent rally to 18-month highs in Bitcoin is investor optimism over the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. The long-awaited approval of Grayscale's fund could clear the way for more listings from large asset management companies, including BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) - which potentially opens the floodgates for billions more investor dollars to pour into the sector.\n\nHowever, investors should note that COIN is hardly a perfect proxy for Bitcoin prices, despite its dependence on the volatile market. Over the last three months, COIN is down 24%, while BTC is up 15%. And in the last month alone, COIN's 7% gain significantly lags a nearly 30% rise in BTC.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nCoinbase Stock: Looking Beyond Bitcoin\n\nTo its credit, Coinbase has expanded its portfolio of products and solutions over the past two years, enabling it to expand its ecosystem significantly and reduce its dependency on volatile crypto trading volumes. For instance, in 2021, the company\u2019s transaction revenue accounted for 87% of sales. In Q2 of 2023, transaction sales accounted for less than 50% of total revenue.\n\nIn particular, Coinbase is banking on its subscription and services business to gain traction. This segment includes products such as interest income, custodial fees, staking, and blockchain rewards. Revenue in its subscription and services business grew from just $45 million in 2020 to $792 million in 2023. In Q2, subscription sales more than doubled to $335.4 million.\n\nBut for Coinbase to remain a solid long-term investment option, Bitcoin will have to gain widespread adoption globally. Bitcoin was built to replace fiat currencies and facilitate global transactions at a low cost. However, the lack of regulatory clarity has remained a significant headwind - which is why crypto-related investments reacted so strongly to recent indications of a potential SEC victory.\n\nAnalysts Call COIN a Hold\n\nCoinbase enjoys a first-mover advantage and is forecast to end 2023 with sales of $2.78 billion, while adjusted earnings are forecast at $1.73 per share. That said, COIN trades at 6.7x forward sales, which is quite steep for an unprofitable company that's projected to report steeper losses into the next fiscal year.\n\nOut of the 22 analysts covering Coinbase stock, the average recommendation is a \u201chold.\u201d Six recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d one recommends \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d eight recommend \u201chold,\u201d two recommend \u201cmoderate sell,\u201d and five recommend \u201cstrong sell.\u201d The average target price for COIN is $83.84, which is 12.5% above the current trading price.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Over the past seven days, bitcoin has surged more than 20%. That\u2019s a bull market unto itself. It\u2019s also one fueled by speculation that the SEC will soon approve ETFs with spot bitcoin exposure. That\u2019s one of the most widely anticipated events in the histories of the ETF industry and the crypto space.\n\nThe long-running speculation can affect other cryptocurrency-related assets, including bitcoin mining equities. This is the asset class largely tracked by the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) .\n\nHopes for a spot bitcoin ETF cut both ways. Speculation is just that, and there are no guarantees that the SEC will imminently approve such ETFs. Said another way, bitcoin and ETFs such as SATO could use catalysts beyond regulatory approvals. Fortunately, it appears that\u2019s happening.\n\nCrypto ETF SATO Could Be Golden\n\nSATO could benefit in two ways. Recent data indicates bitcoin\u2019s correlations to equities, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX), are declining. Second, the cryptocurrency\u2019s correlations to gold are increasing.\n\nThat\u2019s a positive, because over the past month, the largest gold-backed ETF is higher by 4.22%. Those tightening correlations could fortify bitcoin\u2019s status as a safe-haven assets. That\u2019s something it has long lacked, but something crypto bulls have long craved.\n\n\u201cGeopolitical risk amid new conflict in the Middle East has raised hackles among investors and seen traders flock into gold, long seen as a safe bet in times of turmoil that rock the stock market,\u201d reported Jack Denton for Barron\u2019s. \u201cWhile Bitcoin has long been dubbed \u2018digital gold\u2019 by its proponents, the largest crypto has not always performed as a haven asset, though its increasing link to gold could be a sign that this is changing, especially with respect to geopolitical risk.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s emerging status as an alternative asset is useful on multiple fronts. Not only does it make bitcoin easier to classify for novice investors, it could bolster the digital currency\u2019s status as a safe haven amid rampant inflation and geopolitical volatility.\n\n\u201cWe [view]bitcoin as an investment being a non-sovereign store of value which had potential exposure to economic and internet growth, whilst being largely uncorrelated to other asset classes,\u201d according to CoinShares. \u201cWe also find that in the context of a portfolio, it behaves in a similar manner to other alternative assets in providing diversification, with the exception that its portfolio diversification benefits are far greater than its competitors.\u201d"

        "content": "Matrixport, a cryptocurrency trading firm founded by Bitmain co-founder Wu Jihan, has doubled down on its prediction that Bitcoin (BTC) will hit $45,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nAfter first setting its 2023 year-end BTC price target at $45,000 in early 2023, Matrixport reiterated its bold Bitcoin prediction in a blog post on Oct. 24.\n\nTitled \u201cBitcoin Targets $45,000 \u2014 FOMO Is Hitting the Market,\u201d the blog post provides a brief analysis of Matrixport\u2019s previous market forecasts, noting that the firm successfully predicted several market events.\n\nMatrixport specifically cited its \u201cOctober Ignites a Bitcoin Boom: Institutions Fueling the Price Surge\u201d report from September 2023, which has so far successfully predicted significant action on the Bitcoin market in October.\n\nThe firm predicted that October would be a strong month for Bitcoin due to excitement around potential approvals of a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF). The firm also pointed out that October has historically been the strongest month for Bitcoin, with average returns of 20%.\n\nRelated: Galaxy predicts 74% Bitcoin price increase first year after ETF launch\n\nAfter starting October at around $27,000, Bitcoin briefly touched $35,000 on Oct. 24, hitting 17-month highs and triggering the fear of missing out among investors. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $34,396, up 27% from its price on Oct. 1, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin 30-day price chart. Source: CoinGecko\n\nIn the report, Matrixport also emphasized that Bitcoin\u2019s breakout above July\u2019s $31,500 shows that $45,000 is achievable by year-end, adding:\n\n\u201cWhile our prediction might have been bold, our analysis is based on a proven investment process that has been incredibly successful this year.\u201d\n\nMatrixport first mentioned the $45,000 Bitcoin prediction in its bullish 2023 report published in January 2023. \u201cThere is a high statistical probability that Bitcoin prices could double from here until year end. This could bring Bitcoin prices to $45,000 by Christmas 2023,\u201d the firm wrote at the time.\n\nSome analysts haven\u2019t been too optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s price in 2023, though. In December 2022, Standard\u2019s Chartered global research head and chief strategist predicted that Bitcoin would drop to as low as $5,000 in 2023. Bitcoin\u2019s lowest value so far this year was about $16,600.\n\nMagazine: Blockchain detectives \u2014 Mt. Gox collapse saw birth of Chainalysis"

        "title": "Beware the Bitcoin Rally: Short Squeeze and Excitement Not Enough for Bull Cycle - CCN.com",
        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin jumped by 125% from its November 21 low.\n\nBTC has a short-term potential for further gains below $40,000.\n\nOn-chain figures don\u2019t suggest a high demand.\n\nA larger descending move could soon occur.\n\nContrary to widespread predictions, Bitcoin surprised the market on Monday, October 23, surging to $35,200, marking a remarkable 33% increase from its October 12 low of $26,570.\n\nThis unexpected surge set off a chain reaction in the cryptocurrency market, driving altcoins like LINK, AAVE, BSV, and INJ to even more impressive gains from their October lows. Our recent analysis of Bitcoin explored potential catalysts for this surge.\n\nWhile undeniable fundamental factors are at play, such as mounting anticipation of a Bitcoin ETF and hint at its imminent reality, the true drivers behind these price spikes seem to be two short-squeeze events.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to grasp the dynamics of altcoin valuations. Their USD values are primarily linked to their BTC equivalents since most altcoins are primarily traded against BTC and ETH on exchanges. This means that even though it may seem like all altcoins are surging, their USD values essentially rise in sync with Bitcoin\u2019s ascent.\n\nIn light of this context \u2013 a short-squeeze indicating predominantly bearish market sentiment and the altcoin rally largely mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s price movement \u2013 it prompts the question: How reliable is this rally?\n\nBitcoin On-chain data\n\nWhen assessing the on-chain demand for Bitcoin, it\u2019s crucial to take into account the quantity of Bitcoin held on exchanges, as this can offer valuable insights into accumulation patterns.\n\nOn-Chain Demand Analysis:\n\nThe chart illustrating Bitcoin holdings on exchanges has displayed a consistent downtrend since its peak in June, persisting throughout the year. Nonetheless, when viewed alongside recent developments and past occasions when Bitcoin\u2019s price surged, the decrease in supply seems relatively modest.\n\nStarting from October 13, when the amount of Bitcoin on exchanges peaked at 2,056,000, it gradually decreased to 2,018,000 by October 19, indicating a relatively minor decline of just 38,000 BTC. Notably, this decrease preceded the recent price surge. Interestingly, as the price began its ascent, the number of Bitcoins on exchanges began to rise once more. This trend implies that investors might be transferring their Bitcoin to exchanges, possibly with the intent to capitalize on the rising prices and secure their profits. The growing deposits may indicate a willingness among some investors to sell, particularly if they anticipate a potential price correction following the parabolic increase.\n\nSupply Side Analysis \u2013 Miners\n\nShifting our focus to the supply side, miners hold a central role. The Miner Position Index (MPI) offers valuable insights into their actions. Elevated MPI values signal substantial Bitcoin deposits by miners on exchanges, often signaling a potential intention to sell. By analyzing the MPI, we can assess whether miners aim to take advantage of current price levels or are maintaining their Bitcoin, anticipating further price appreciation.\n\nIn conclusion, while on-chain metrics offer valuable insights into market behavior, it\u2019s essential to consider them alongside other indicators and the broader market sentiment to gain a comprehensive understanding of potential price movements. A distinct upward trend becomes evident when smoothing the chart with a 7-day moving average, starting from September 9, with a temporary dip to $25,000. This upward trend persisted for the most part of the price rise from Monday, suggesting that miners have been exerting pressure on the price. Distinguished crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X on potential future price targets for Bitcoin.\n\n#Bitcoin built a massive support barrier between $25,000 and $30,000. The UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) model now suggests the next two critical areas of resistance for $BTC are $38,440 and $47,360! pic.twitter.com/tdgdYYiMnW \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) October 24, 2023\n\nHe highlighted a robust support region between $25,000 and $30,000, backed by the creation of a substantial number of UTXOs at that price range. \u201cThese bars represent the quantity of existing bitcoins that last moved within the specified price bucket.\u201d He interprets this UTXO distribution as a support zone, indicating that investors who purchased at these levels are unlikely to sell below them, expecting higher prices. This is why he identifies the next resistance zone at approximately $38,440. It\u2019s worth noting that these tall bars could be misleading because they represent the quantity of UTXOs rather than the number of coins, i.e., volume.\n\nBTC Price Analysis\n\nWhen analyzing Bitcoin\u2019s price chart, it becomes evident that there is still potential for further upside. The recent uptrend that began on October 12 has been shaping a five-wave pattern, with the current upswing representing its wave 3.\n\nThe current path implies that a modest higher high may soon occur, signifying the culmination of this particular upward move. This will likely be followed by a retracement, indicating the end of wave 4, and another anticipated surge leading to wave 5. The target for this surge could hover just below the $40,000 threshold, aligning with significant horizontal resistance, as emphasized by analyst Ali Martinez\u2019s UTXO distribution resistance. However, considering that this may mark the final wave of a higher-degree trend originating on November 21, a more substantial downturn is on the horizon. If this indeed marks the beginning of a new bull cycle after a prolonged period of declining prices, the next critical milestone would be establishing the initial higher low of the bull market. This is likely to take the form of an ABC correction, representing wave 2 of a higher degree. Ideally, this correction should remain above the $25,000 level. Should the price approach the anticipated peak of around $40,000 and then experience a 38% decline, it could potentially shake the confidence of short-term investors, prompting a reassessment of their positions.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the recent upswing in Bitcoin\u2019s price is undoubtedly bullish, several factors must align before we can confidently proclaim the beginning of a new bull cycle. While catalysts like the anticipated Bitcoin ETF and the short-squeeze have played a role in the current rally, a genuine bull cycle for Bitcoin necessitates more enduring and foundational triggers. One of the significant upcoming events is Bitcoin\u2019s halving scheduled for next year. Historically, the market tends to price in the anticipation of halving, often resulting in an uptrend leading up to the event and sustaining momentum post-halving. However, to genuinely confirm the start of a bull cycle, a mere price surge and temporary bullish sentiment won\u2019t suffice. We need to witness the emergence of a sustained uptrend, marked by the establishment of a higher low, indicating that the market is creating new support levels. Skeptics still exist, with some predicting Bitcoin\u2019s potential drop below $15,000. Nevertheless, if Bitcoin can establish a higher low, it would not only shift the narrative but also potentially convert many bearish investors into bulls. Such a move would solidify the belief that Bitcoin found its bottom last November.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

        "content": "A company is petitioning former Ripple chief technology officer Stefan Thomas for a hard drive containing more than 7,000 Bitcoin (BTC) that he has been unable to access for years.\n\nIn an Oct. 25 open letter, crypto recovery firm Unciphered offered to unlock an IronKey hard drive belonging to Thomas containing 7,002 BTC \u2014 roughly $244 million at the time of publication. The former Ripple chief technology officer forgot the information to access the drive, designed to erase its data if an individual enters the incorrect password ten times. So far, the German-born programmer has used eight out of his ten attempts.\n\nAccording to Unciphered, its teams developed a method to crack the hardware and access the BTC keys safely stored for years. Technology magazine Wired reported on Oct. 25 that the company was able to access the data on a similar IronKey after \u201c200 trillion tries\u201d \u2014 seemingly bypassing the 10-attempt restriction on the drive.\n\n\u201cThough there are always caveats, this is not theoretical,\u201d said Unciphered. \u201cWe can do it; we\u2019ve done it many times before [...] And we can do it again. You don\u2019t have to take our word for it [...] we would be happy to demonstrate it on as many samples in a row as it takes for you (and everyone) to feel confident before moving forward.\u201d\n\nThis is an open letter to Stefan Thomas (@justmoon) - we would love to help you get back into your IronKey.https://t.co/zhfu41b9jn pic.twitter.com/1hYg3h79BF \u2014 Unciphered LLC (@uncipheredLLC) October 25, 2023\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Unciphered CEO Eric Michaud said the company accessed the data in the IronKey from the Wired report by extracting some of the drive\u2019s information and using offline servers, giving its team more than one bite at the apple at guessing the password. He declined to say what the firm would ask for in return from Thomas but added Unciphered had created a \u201csustainable business\u201d helping people recover crypto.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re prepared if Stefan doesn\u2019t want to work with us, but we\u2019re hopeful,\u201d said Michaud. \u201cWe already have a business that is growing and we\u2019ll be here when he\u2019s ready.\u201c\n\nRelated: Ledger hardware wallet rolls out cloud-based private key recovery tool\n\nThere are many highly publicized stories like Thomas\u2019 involving recovery or users unable to locate their keys for one reason or another. In 2021, a Redditor claimed to have regained access to 127 BTC after more than ten years, finding the private keys on an old computer. In 2013, British national James Howells mistakenly discarded a hard drive containing roughly 7,500 BTC \u2014 he has made multiple attempts to locate and recover the drive in a landfill without success.\n\nEstimates from 2022 suggested that users could have lost access to roughly 20% of Bitcoin\u2019s supply. This amounted to billions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency.\n\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market: Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in"

There\u2019s also an upsurge in new products and technologies claiming to enhance the oldest and largest blockchain. Just two weeks ago, The Protocol covered the details of Robin Linus\u2019s research paper on \u201cBitVM,\u201d proposing a way of incorporating smart contracts onto Bitcoin.

        "content": "Galaxy Digital: Bitcoin ETFs Could See $14.4B Inflows in First Year\n\nThe launch of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could generate at least $14.4 billion in inflows in the first year, according to a research report from crypto firm Galaxy Digital.\n\nAccording to the fund, ETFs could be a better investment vehicle than existing products such as trusts and futures, which have a total value of more than $21 billion. Inflows could reach $27 billion in the second year and $39 billion in the third.\n\nGalaxy Digital notes that the US wealth management business, with $48.3 trillion in assets, represents a sizable market for a Bitcoin ETF. The need for such products is obvious, with rumors and reports about ETFs driving significant price increases. Given the liquidity and price impact of large investments, the introduction of spot ETFs might result in a 74% spike in bitcoin prices in the first year.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "For more than a decade, the primary narratives surrounding Bitcoin (BTC) have focused on its role as peer-to-peer digital cash and a store of value.\n\nHowever, all indications suggest that we are witnessing a significant shift in this paradigm.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, one of the most discussed topics in the Bitcoin ecosystem has been the use of the world\u2019s leading blockchain to store information that goes beyond the previously mentioned use cases.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin fragments could become more valuable than full Bitcoins\n\nIf you have been isolated in an igloo during this crypto winter and are unaware of the developments, here is a brief overview.\n\nIn January 2023, developer Casey Rodamor introduced Ordinals to the world, a protocol that allows you to permanently inscribe any file into the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first method created for such an action, but it gained the most traction, creating a trend where nonfungible token (NFT) collections, music, video games, journalistic articles and even WikiLeaks records began to be stored in an eternal and immutable manner on the world\u2019s largest decentralized network.\n\n'Anonymous activist group is inscribing the Afghan war logs published by WikiLeaks into #Bitcoin to protest imprisonment of Julian Assange' @BitcoinMagazine #FreeAssange https://t.co/1huZ6J9SDM \u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 23, 2023\n\nAs a result, experiments, innovation and the perspective of the Bitcoin network as a vast decentralized database began to simmer.\n\nDespite being less than a year old, the Ordinals protocol has been evolving remarkably to become more efficient and to enable bolder use cases.\n\nOne of the noteworthy enhancements is the technique of recursive inscriptions, which allows users to circumvent the 4-megabyte storage limit per block, enabling the insertion of larger data on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nAs an example \u2014 illustrated by the image below \u2014 I inscribed an entire article from Cointelegraph on Bitcoin using a recursive inscription.\n\nCointelegraph article inscribed on Bitcoin as Ordinal inscription #35,185,228. Source: https://www.ord.io/35185228\n\nIn total, eight inscriptions were made to achieve the final result, at a total file size of 5.22 kilobytes. (That\u2019s small.) Seven of the inscriptions were images from the article, each stored individually in a satoshi through the Ordinals protocol. The eighth inscription comprises a code that contains the article\u2019s text and issues requests to retrieve the images from the other satoshis.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin has entered a civil war \u2014 Over \u2018art\u2019\n\nThis assembly allowed for the complete article to be eternally inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain, a feat that couldn\u2019t have been achieved in a single step while maintaining quality.\n\nLeonidas, a developer within the Ordinals community, offered an even more profound perspective on the matter on Twitter, writing:\n\n\u201cWhat if lots of people upload lots of packages of code into the Bitcoin Blockchain? So now there is a huge repository of packages for developers to build on top of. This would unlock powerful use cases that could never be accommodated in under 4 MB. The most complex pieces of software are just a bunch of code compiled together after all. Now it becomes possible to put a complex 3D video game fully on-chain on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWTF are recursive inscriptions?\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know:\n\n\n\nEarlier this year the Ordinals Protocol introduced the ability for anyone to inscribe files fully on-chain onto Bitcoin. These inscriptions are self-contained and unaware of the other files that had been\u2026 pic.twitter.com/O3jt6lhaxT \u2014 Leonidas (@LeonidasNFT) June 12, 2023\n\nWith just this, a world of possibilities can be contemplated and reimagined. After all, the ability to use the world\u2019s leading blockchain as an immutable, shared, uncensored data storage is huge.\n\nBut the innovations don't stop there!\n\nIn October, Lightning Labs announced the first mainnet release of Taproot Assets (TARO), further enhancing the Bitcoin blockchain as a multiasset network.\n\nAnnouncing the first mainnet release of Taproot Assets , a protocol for assets on #bitcoin and Lightning.\n\n\n\nWith this release, developers can issue financial assets on-chain in a scalable manner.\n\n\n\nToday marks a new era of multi-asset bitcoin. https://t.co/2cNvZSvv8v \u2014 Lightning Labs\u26a1\ufe0f (@lightning) October 18, 2023\n\nThis could not have occurred at a more opportune time, given the enthusiasm ignited by the Ordinals protocol and the way it paved the path for TARO to shine alongside it.\n\nThe Ordinals Protocol has broadened the perspective of users and builders, allowing them to construct and view Bitcoin as a network of multiple assets.\n\nOrdinals assets \u2014 via flooding the network with transactions \u2014 compelled Binance to implement an integration with Lightning. This key factor \u2014 combined with low costs, decentralization and high network settlement speed \u2014 makes trading other coins and assets very attractive through Taproot Assets.\n\nAnd among the various applications of the TARO protocol, one of the most mentioned is the ability to issue stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe shift in paradigm is monumental, as it paves the way for Bitcoin to transform from being primarily an exchangeable asset to becoming the medium through which exchanges occur.\n\nThis innovation is going to empower builders to import successful use cases from other chains and bring them back to the mothership.\n\nSome even joke that all other chains are just Bitcoin\u2019s testnets. Does it all lead back to Bitcoin?\n\nTHE BITCOIN RENAISSANCE CAN\u2019T BE STOPPED\n\n\n\nthe magicians at @lightning labs are back with an efficient protocol for tokens on top of bitcoin\n\n\n\nethereum was a testnet. get in anon we\u2019re going to the moon pic.twitter.com/2g6vPFBAbV \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) May 16, 2023\n\nOverall, we could say that we are on the edge of a new Bitcoin era \u2014 the era of the multiasset orange network.\n\nIn addition to attracting and retaining more developers who may be interested in these new protocols, these new applications also have the potential to draw in and retain new users who initially didn\u2019t find interest or value in Bitcoin as a store of value.\n\nFor some, transforming the world can sometimes occur through the simple enjoyment of some fun, encrypted sports cards. But with the optimization of Ordinals, the number of possibilities will continue expanding.\n\nA January 1993 post authored by Hal Finney speculating on the idea of marketing digital cash as cryptographic trading cards. Source: Compuserve\n\nHal Finney, a prominent cypherpunk \u2014 and the first person to receive a transaction from Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 wrote in a 1993 post on Compuserve: \u201cGiving a little more thought to the idea of buying and selling digital cash, I thought of a way to present it. We\u2019re buying and selling cryptographic trading cards.\u201d\n\nFinney knew, and now you know too.\n\nLugui Tillier is the chief commercial officer of Lumx Studios, a Web3 studio that counts BTG Pactual Bank, the largest investment bank in Latin America, among its investors.

        "content": "A team of cybersecurity experts say they have figured out how to access a Bitcoin wallet worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The only problem is that the owner isn't interested.\n\nIn 2011, programmer Stefan Thomas created an animated video titled \"What Is Bitcoin\" for a Bitcoin enthusiast in Switzerland. For his trouble, he was appropriately paid in Bitcoin. 7,002 Bitcoins to be precise. At the time the coins were only worth around $2 each, which is still pretty good for a short and relatively simple animation. Bitcoins are now worth around $34,095.40 each, making his Bitcoin worth $238,735,990.80.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUnfortunately for Thomas, he was the security-conscious type, and kept the Bitcoin on an encrypted IronKey hard drive. The IronKey gives whoever is trying to access it 10 guesses before it basically self-destructs, making it inaccessible to anyone who, for example, has $238,735,990.80 stored on there.\n\nThis is great when it's some other nefarious character trying to access your money, but less than ideal when that nefarious person is you 10 years on with absolutely no memory of what the password is, and the amount you're attempting to access is $240 million. This is precisely what happened to Thomas, having lost the piece of paper on which he'd noted his password.\n\nSince the value of Bitcoin skyrocketed, he has attempted to access the hard drive in various different ways. The result is that he has two tries left before his stash is lost forever.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThomas is not the only one attempting to get into that wallet. As well as two teams hired by him, cyber security experts have been tempted by the possibility of hacking the wallet and earning themselves a tasty commission in the process.\n\nUnciphered, a firm that specializes in recovering lost cryptocurrency, has been working on a solution. Now they say they have found a way to crack into decade-old IronKey hard drives, demonstrating to Wired that it is possible by having journalist Andy Greenberg set a password, which they then messaged back to him the following day.\n\nThe firm has contacted Thomas now that they are confident of their method, according to Wired, but at the moment he has declined their help, due to agreements he has in place with two teams working on their own solutions.\n\n\u201cI have already been working with a different set of experts on the recovery so I'm no longer free to negotiate with someone new,\u201d Thomas told Wired. \u201cIt's possible that the current team could decide to subcontract Unciphered if they feel that's the best option. We'll have to wait and see.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n[H/T: Wired]"

The Bitcoin halving occurs every four years, and the next halving in 2024 will reduce the BTC mining reward from the current 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. As the total supply of Bitcoin is fixed at 21 million, the halving of BTC mining rewards creates a supply-demand gap that lowers the influx of new BTC into the market.\n\nBitcoin market dominance is a measure of the crypto asset\u2019s market capitalization relative to the overall digital asset market and highlights the asset\u2019s strength.

October has been historically considered a bullish crypto month, leading to the nickname \u201cUptober.\u201d This was evident from Bitcoin\u2019s double-digit percentage surge over the past few weeks, helping BTC rise from just below $27,000 at the start of October to post a new yearly high of $35,000.\n\nUptober has been great, but the party may not be over just yet.\n\n\n\nNovember is historically #Bitcoin's best performing month. pic.twitter.com/kaMMt7pgZz \u2014 Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) October 25, 2023\n\nIn 2017, Bitcoin maintained a market dominance of over 80%, followed by Ether (ETH) with nearly 10%\u201317% in market dominance.

        "content": "Bitcoin hit $35,000-mark on Tuesday after about a year-and-half. The expectations of approval by US Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC), stock market regulators in the United States, to directly invest in the cryptocurrency pushed the largest digital token to rise 20 per cent in a week, and its highest levels since May 2022.\n\n\n\nThe crypto market is struggling to find some ground after the prolonged crypto winter which kicked off in late 2021 on the back of a series of crypto projects failure and liquidity crunch in the global economy. However, the past week brought some good news for the enthusiasts of the new-age asset class.\n\n\n\nTraders were confident that the Securities and Exchange Commission would approve an exchange-traded fund (ETFs) in coming months. The prospect of a spot Bitcoin ETF is seen driving broader flows into the cryptocurrency, as it would allow a wider set of investors to buy exposure without directly trading it.\n\n\n\nHowever, Bitcoin retraced to $34,000 following the removal of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF from the DTCC's website and subsequent reappearance. ETF ticker, IBTC, from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's (DTCC) website.\n\n\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Bitcoin surpassed the $35,000 mark, primarily due to the ticker of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) being listed on the DTCC, which hinted at a potential SEC approval. This development drove Bitcoin to achieve a new yearly high with strong market demand, said Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\n\n\nThe key catalyst for this surge was BlackRock,\" he added. Along with it, rising inflation and Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its GBTC to a spot ETF will be reconsidered by the SEC might have also induced bullishness.\"\n\n\n\nThe bolestered mood in the crypto market pushed the other crypto tokens higher as its largest peer Ethereum surged about 15 per cent to top $1,800-mark, while Solana jumped 30 per cent in a week. Other altcoins including Chainlink, Mina, Injective were up 50-90 per cent in a week. The overall optimism in the digital token space pushed the crypto mcap close to $1.3 trillion.\n\n\n\nVikram Subburaj, CEO at Giottus Crypto Platform said that the expectations of mass adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) as a safe haven investment akin to Gold is around the corner has excited crypto enthusiasts.\n\n\n\n\"The rally has been fuelled by a positive development with regards to its spot ETF approval in the US \u2013 BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin trust got submitted and listed into the depository trust clearing corporation with the official ticker marked down as $IBTC, bringing the ETF one step closer to reality,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBlackRock's (BLK) spot Bitcoin ETF ticker, IBTC, was temporarily removed from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's (DTCC) website. However, the ticker was relisted after a few hours but sparked the speculations above the approvals regarding the Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has entered a bullish midterm zone after a breakout of the level of $31,500, said Patel from Mudrex. \"As long as the price maintains itself above this threshold, the bullish sentiment is expected to outmuscle the bearish forces. Consequently, there is a prospect of witnessing additional upward movement, potentially reaching the range of $36,000 to $38,000,\" he added.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is trading above its 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages and are currently consolidating after their recent upward momentum.\n\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that Bitcoin dominance of crypto market cap has increased to 54 per cent \u2013 a level not seen since April 2021. This likely indicates that there is a strong rotation of capital to the number one crypto asset as total crypto market cap has not put in a new high this year yet, said Subbarao from Giotuss.\n\n\n\n\"Bitcoin has pulled back to near $34,000 today, which was expected after such a meaty rally. As long as it holds $33,000, the possibility of taking out $35,000 again remains strong in the near term,\" he said\n\nDisclaimer: Business Today provides stock market news for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice.

Gold, and most importantly, Bitcoin, will begin rising on true fears of global wartime inflation.\u201d\n\nThe writing is already on the wall. BTC/USD is up 15% this week, and the gains followed U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s address to the nation on the Ukraine and Israel wars.\n\nNow, the blog post reiterates, \u201cDirectly after the Biden speech, Bitcoin \u2014 along with gold \u2014 is rallying against a backdrop of an aggressive selloff in long-end US Treasuries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t speculation as to an ETF being approved \u2014 this is Bitcoin discounting a future, very inflationary global world war situation,\u201d it continues.\n\nHayes is well known for his predictions of how global economics will play out post-COVID-19 and subsequent inflationary eras.\n\nAs part of the knock-on effects for Bitcoin, a $1-million BTC price tag is in play \u2014 something repeated on social media this week.

Rather, it will become what it truly is: a Potemkin village where the Fed fixes the level of interest at politically expedient levels,\u201d \u201cThe Periphery,\u201d meanwhile, concludes.\n\n\u201cOnce everyone realises the game we are playing, the Bitcoin and crypto bull market will be in full swing.

That is because being allied and helpful to the allied countries in these brutal wars is always very costly and raises the risks of being drawn fully into the war. That\u2019s how local wars spread into world wars.\u201d\n\nCombined with buzz over an exchange-traded fund approval, Bitcoin is up 27% this October and over 100% year-to-date, per data from monitoring resource CoinGlass.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFreshman Mexican Senator Indira Kempis made headlines last year when she introduced a bill that would create of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Now, she has her eyes set on making Bitcoin an integral part of her political agenda.\n\nKempis is a congresswoman from the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, which is situated north of Mexico City and shares a small border with Texas. After coming across Bitcoin several times \u201cand not really understanding it,\u201d she told Decrypt that she knew she had to take a closer look after learning of obstacles that entrepreneurs were facing.\n\nHaving helped the group that later became Bitso, the largest exchange in the country, Kempis began to open the conversation in the legislative branch and push forward what she considers \u201cthe road to creative alternatives.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe set forth the aforementioned bill, which had no mention of Bitcoin or decentralized assets in its original form. It was a pragmatic approach, she said, and a first step towards establishing the necessary legal framework for the country to acknowledge\u2014and ultimately accept\u2014Bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nIn her initial bill, the country\u2019s central bank, the Banco de M\u00e9xico, would be the sole issuer of digital currency. Having felt the backlash for introducing a CBDC by the crypto community\u2013although she claims \u201cit was a necessary step to open the discussion\u201d\u2013Kempis modified the proposal to include Bitcoin.\n\nIt\u2019s been an arduous journey, she told Decrypt, pointing out that after a Bitcoin ATM was installed inside the Mexican Senate, members of the Mexican congress and their teams are beginning to ask more questions.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much opposition to her bill initially, \u201cbecause nobody really understood Bitcoin,\u201d Kempis recalled. Now, it\u2019s getting attention, both positive and negative. But she says she doesn\u2019t get upset when she runs across detractors, because their rejection still means \u201cwe are moving the system.\u201d\n\nKempis said she would like to see a heat map of Mexico showing where legislators stand regarding the bill. \u201cI\u2019m looking for clear positions,\u201d she explained, hoping to communicate to the Mexican public whether their representatives are interested or not in this type of innovation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMexico is known for its blossoming tech scene, a pioneering fintech law industry, and a tech-savvy population. In a recent Chainalysis report, it landed below the regional average for centralized exchange use (which is more common in Latin America), suggesting that Mexicans have a wider set of crypto products available to them.\n\nThe senator also pointed out that digital wallets are now available in indigenous languages, which are spoken by 6% of the population, and that remittances have been growing of late, registering a nearly 10% jump year-on-year.\n\nThe bill is being discussed, but has a long way to go. The country\u2019s Central Bank is an integral part of the legislative process, although it claims autonomy, and the Mexican senate has requested a formal analysis and stance from the institution. It hasn\u2019t arrived yet.\n\nThe former head of the central bank was a staunch critic of Bitcoin, said Kempis, whereas his successor, the current governor Victoria Rodr\u00edguez, has remained silent in most of the discussions surrounding Bitcoin.\n\nOther politicians are not sold. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, also known as AMLO, came out to assure that Mexico \u201cwould not\u201d adopt Bitcoin as legal tender after Nayib Bukele\u2019s El Salvador approved its pioneering Bitcoin law.\n\nThat said, the digital peso, which the financial institution is aiming for, should arrive sometime in 2024, the senator said.\n\nAnnouncing a run for the Presidency in the upcoming 2024 elections, Kempis said she plans to continue on her Bitcoin crusade.\n\nBeyond the possibility of being president, the role of the legislative branch, for Senator Kempis, is to offer \u201ca dose\u201d of education and help push the discussion along the way through well-thought-out laws and regulations. \u201cIf El Salvador could do it, surely we can as well,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the end of the day, however, Kempis does take a practical approach to the technology, telling Decrypt that it won\u2019t solve all of Mexico\u2019s problems. Despite her bullishness, she concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s not a panacea.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ryan Ozawa."

Instead, they should encourage us to invest in regulatory interventions and technological advancements that improve the efficiency of the global financial system without harming the environment,\" said Professor Madani."

This has stoked excitement among crypto advocates who have long argued that Bitcoin is a \u201clifeboat\u201d in the sinking fiat-based economy.\n\nAccording to correlation data with the Invesco QQQ ETF, which gives investors exposure to 100 Nasdaq-listed companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon, Bitcoin appears to be decoupling from tech stocks, reimagining itself as a safe haven asset in the process.\n\nDecoupling from Tech Stocks\n\nData on the Bitcoin-Invesco QQQ ETF relationship compiled by the Twitter account \u201cSPY Master\u201d showed recent market movements have led to the lowest correlation between the two in four years, at -0.82.\n\nThe last time the Bitcoin-QQQ correlation was this low was during the tail end of 2019, when the correlation score sunk to -0.84. Correlation scores denote 1 for strong positive correlation, 0 for neutral, and -1 for strong negative correlation.\n\nSPY Master\u2019s chart confirms the historically strong positive correlation between Bitcoin and tech stocks, depicting most data points above 0, with dense clustering above 0.7 around May 2022, during the Terra LUNA collapse.\n\nIn 2023, the correlation points spread more evenly along the correlation scale than in previous years, indicating a trend of positive correlation weakening, particularly around April.\n\nBitcoin-Invesco QQQ ETF correlation by SPY Master.\n\nCommenting on the trend, the Twitter account Bitcoin Archive confidently announced that the decoupling is here. However, not everyone is convinced that this trend will continue.\n\nBitcoin Cautiousness\n\nAlthough Bitcoin\u2019s strong recent performance has reinvigorated bullishness across crypto markets, leading to talk of a decoupling in action, some have expressed doubt that Bitcoin can sustain rallying momentum.\n\nTony Edward, the founder of the Thinking Crypto podcast, mentioned that the Bitcoin-tech stock correlation has historical precedence and should not be discounted so easily. Edward anticipates that the stock downturn will eventually catch up to Bitcoin, leading the BTC price to move lower.\n\nI agree with David here, I lean towards momentum play. Bitcoin lagged behind the stock market and is now catching up.\n\n\n\nHistory shows us a high correlation between BTC and Tech stocks. The stock market is showing weakness so I think the capital is flowing to BTC and crypto for a\u2026 https://t.co/XWcyIQqPlF \u2014 Tony Edward (Thinking Crypto Podcast) (@ThinkingCrypto1) October 25, 2023\n\nLikewise, Joe Carlasare agreed with Edward\u2019s assessment of the situation, saying that the close correlation between Bitcoin and stocks \u201cwill bring BTC back to earth.\u201d\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThere is no historical data for Bitcoin price performance in a recession, making predictive calls more arbitrary than usual.\n\nRegulation and energy consumption concerns weigh heavily on Bitcoin\u2019s viability as a widely accepted asset class.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nDecoupling challenges the prevailing narrative that Bitcoin is a risk-on asset. As Bitcoin climbs while tech stocks plummet, the leading cryptocurrency may soon be mentioned in the same breath as gold as a trusted store of value.\n\nLearn more about the factors driving the recent Bitcoin rally here:\n\nUnpacking the Bitcoin Rally: What\u2019s Driving the Surge?\n\n\n\nLarry Fink likens Bitcoin to \u201chuman freedom,\u201d read more here:\n\nBlackRock CEO Calls Bitcoin Priceless, Like Freedom"

        "title": "Bitcoin price surge spurs asset outflows from crypto exchanges - Forbes India",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nBitcoin price surge has triggered substantial asset outflows from major crypto exchanges. This development is seen as a bullish sign, reflecting traders' confidence in Bitcoin's continued upward trajectory. The movement of funds away from exchanges and into secure storage suggests that traders anticipate further price increases.\n\n\n\nAccording to data provided by crypto analytics firm CoinGlass, Binance witnessed the largest outflow, with over $500 million leaving the exchange within the past 24 hours. This trend was followed by crypto.com, recording $49.4 million in outflows, and OKX, with $31 million. Most other exchanges saw outflows of less than $20 million.\n\nThese outflows are seen as a strong indicator of trader sentiment rather than fear-driven withdrawals, as witnessed during the peak of the bear market. Data from Glassnode confirms that the outflows align with Bitcoin's recent price surge.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to the price surge, approximately $400 million worth of short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. A total of 94,755 traders experienced the liquidation of derivative positions, with the largest single liquidation order, worth $9.98 million, occurring on Binance.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn-chain analysts have also pointed to the market value to realised value (MVRV) ratio, a metric that assesses an asset's market value compared to its realised value. The current MVRV ratio stands at 1.47, closely resembling the ratio during the last bull run, which was 1.5.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall crypto market capitalisation has surged by over 7.3% in the last 24 hours, reaching $1.25 trillion, its highest valuation since April. The catalyst behind this surge is speculation surrounding the launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The surge is also linked to the announcement of the iShares Spot Bitcoin Trust's listing on The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin's recent price increase has impacted the broader cryptocurrency market, particularly stocks related to Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin-related stocks have experienced multi-week highs, with standout performers including MicroStrategy, whose stock has surged by nearly 9 percent. Coinbase, a major cryptocurrency exchange, has also seen its stock price rise by 3.42 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bitcoin price surge has also affected Bitcoin mining stocks. Riot Blockchain recorded an 11.69 percent surge, while Marathon Digital Holdings enjoyed a remarkable 14.6 percent increase. Anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will reduce the mining reward, has contributed to this surge.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin mining stocks have outperformed BTC not only in their daily price rallies but also in terms of year-to-date gains. Companies such as Cipher Mining Inc., Riot Platforms, Northern Data AG, Hut 8 Mining Corp, Iris Energy, Bitfarms, Marathon Digital, and Hive Technologies have registered impressive growth figures, surpassing the 100 percent mark this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin's price surge has led to asset outflows on exchanges, driven Bitcoin-related stocks to new highs, and bolstered Bitcoin mining stocks, reflecting the overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writer is the founder at yMedia.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe major cryptocurrencies traded higher on Thursday amid optimism and stimulating bullish sentiments within the market. While the global cryptocurrency market cap surged 0.77% to around $1.27 trillion in the last 24 hours.Bitcoin was up 1.47% at $34,626 as of 12:30 p.m., while its largest peer, Ethereum, surged 1.4% to above the $1,800 level.The consistent gains registered by BTC have overshadowed the price action of ETH and other major altcoins. This has led to BTC dominance hitting a new 30-month high of over 54%; the highest since April 2021. However, as investors become comfortable with the risk curve during this market phase, altcoins may see an uptick in investor interest, leading to a correction in BTC dominance, said Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures.Other popular altcoins, including Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, rose over 6% each. Also, Cardano, Solana, Polygon, Polkadot, Litecoin and Toncoin surged.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, surged to $675 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 53.24%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours declined 27.1% to $24.14 billion.\"Bitcoin\u2019s decoupling from stock indices has brought cheer to the crypto community. The asset is up 23% on a weekly basis and aims to make a fresh move towards $35,000, a key level to hold for further gains. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is at its highest since April 2021, implying that traders are routing capital to the number one crypto asset over altcoins,\" said Vikram Subburaj, CEO at Giottus Crypto Platform.\"However, some altcoins have rallied considerably this week including Layer-1 asset Solana (SOL) and memecoin Pepe (PEPE). A minor pullback in the markets is likely in the short-term but the trend is clear as Bitcoin heads towards a Golden Cross (crossing of 50-day and 200-day moving averages) which is typically bullish,\" Subburaj added. Bitcoin price is in an uptrend with potential resistance levels at $36,507 and $38,579. If the market turns bearish, support can be found at $31,212, $29,172 and $27,956.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is high at 78, indicating potential overbought conditions but also strong momentum. The 50-day EMA at $30,673 supports a positive short-term trend. The bullish pattern, \"Three White Soldiers\", indicates a reversal from the previous downtrend.Bitcoin is currently testing the $34,705 level, which is a crucial point. A break above it can increase buying interest. Overall, Bitcoin's trajectory appears bullish, with $34,700 a critical level to watch.(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
