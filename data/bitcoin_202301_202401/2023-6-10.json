        "title": "Ohio needs to champion bitcoin and blockchain technologies| columnist - The Columbus Dispatch",
        "content": "Andrew Burchwell\n\nGuest Columnist\n\nOhio\u2019s historical legacy is rooted in innovation. Our economic success and progress have always depended on our willingness to try new things \u2013 leading to innovations in energy manufacturing, healthcare, IT and more. Today, as we see new opportunities through digital advancements in blockchain technologies like bitcoin, it\u2019s critical we keep our innovative spirit alive and open to stay competitive in an increasingly complex and global environment.\n\nOhioans might be surprised to learn that our state is home to many industry leaders in bitcoin and blockchain development. One reason for the unfamiliarity is that industry leaders benefit from a unified voice to advocate for the industry\u2019s potential, and Ohio is just beginning to organize and champion bitcoin and blockchain technologies from a statewide perspective.\u200b\n\nIf we do not act with an intention, Ohio will miss out on a generational opportunity for its communities, businesses, and families. We are still very early in the development of these technologies, and it is an opportunity Ohio is uniquely positioned to capture.\n\nAt Ohio Blockchain Council, we are working to unite industries under a common banner to advance bitcoin and blockchain technologies for and within our great state. We believe Ohio is well positioned to be a global leader in innovation and development. Combining the resources of multiple companies from various business sectors is our most effective pathway to progress.\n\nOne of the barriers to adoption of any technology is public understanding. The technology behind Bitcoin and blockchain is unquestionably complicated. What is not complicated, though still underemphasized in our public conversation, is the direct positive impact these technologies could have on all of Ohio\u2019s communities. Families across Ohio struggle with high healthcare costs. Recently the Cleveland Clinic, IBM, Aetna and Anthem announced a partnership that will utilize blockchain to improve efficiency, reduce costs and enhance customer experience.\n\nOhio\u2019s rural population stands to uniquely benefit from bitcoin adoption. While bitcoin mining operations like the Standard Power facility in Coshocton create jobs and increase local economic activity, the long-term implications of bitcoin adoption are far greater. It looks like farmers utilizing bitcoin to exert greater control over their pricing, markets and quality assurance. It means small businesses using bitcoin to avoid fees and open themselves up to new customer bases. It allows a new source of funding for municipalities struggling to compete and provide new accommodations for residents. These are just a few examples of the many ways in which the lives of Ohioans will be transformed for the better through innovation.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technology also carry the potential to help solve one of our most complicated and pervasive challenges today: public trust. According to a recent Pew Research report, only two out of 10 Americans trust the federal government. University of Chicago Institute of Politics research indicates that a majority of Americans agree with the statement \u201cthe government is corrupt and rigged against everyday people like me.\u201d Here in Ohio, where we\u2019re living through a still unfolding massive public corruption scandal, it\u2019s very likely trust in public institutions is at an all-time low.\n\nBlockchain technology can help rebuild public trust by enhancing accountability in government contracting, electronic voting, grant disbursement and more, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. That\u2019s because blockchain technology is by definition decentralized, objective and transparent.\n\nMore:Logistics, bitcoin companies receive state tax incentives to create 125 jobs in Columbus\n\nOhio\u2019s congressional delegation has been championing these issues because they know how important they are to our state\u2019s growth. It\u2019s not a red vs. blue issue, and has been overwhelmingly bipartisan through the leadership of Rep. Warren Davidson (R) and Rep. Joyce Beatty (D) in the House of Representatives and newly elected Sen. J.D. Vance (R) in the Senate.\n\nHowever, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D) has been absent as a champion and leader on bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology. He sits as chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction on these important issues, but has yet to be a forward-leaning advocate for our state. Senator Brown has the opportunity to propel Ohio into a category of its own on bitcoin, and we are here to show him that the work being done across our beautiful state is only just beginning.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technologies represent significant potential for uplifting communities, businesses, and families. Harnessing this potential is only possible through an aligned, unified and collaborative approach toward adoption and public policy. This is our mission at Ohio Blockchain Council, and we believe Ohio can truly become the heart of it all.\n\nAndrew Burchwell, executive director of Ohio Blockchain Council"

        "title": "Bhutan puts Bitcoin mining plan in motion to power up economy - Nikkei Asia",
        "content": "THIMPHU -- The tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, known for its Gross National Happiness development indicator, is embarking on a cryptocurrency mining project as it aspires to build a 21st-century economy.\n\nThe country has teamed up with Nasdaq-listed Bitdeer Technologies Group, based in Singapore, to develop a 600 megawatt mining farm for Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency. Bitdeer was due to establish a closed-end fund at the end of May, aimed at raising $500 million from international investors for the project. A high-level source close to the project confirmed that the fundraising drive indeed began as planned.\n\n\"While Bhutan faces geographical constraints and connectivity challenges, being landlocked and mountainous, its green and relatively cheaper power provides an opportunity to invest in digital assets to build a more connected and sustainable economy,\" said Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), the government investment arm that is partnering with Bitdeer.\n\n\"In doing so, it will deepen local knowledge and engagement in the rapidly evolving technology landscape and equip citizens to participate in the modern global economy from within Bhutan.\"\n\nThe move into crypto mining, a notoriously volatile and controversial industry, comes as the country is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, which shrank the economy by 10% in 2020. Foreign currency reserves have declined, nonperforming loans in the manufacturing and tourism sectors have increased and youth unemployment reached 29% last year.\n\nThis has cast a shadow over Bhutan's \"development success story,\" in the words of the World Bank, with an estimated 12.4% of the population of around 786,000 living below the national poverty line last year, up from 8.2% in 2017, according to government surveys.\n\nGrowth is forecast at 4.6% this year. But tourism, the country's second-largest revenue earner, is not expected to reach pre-pandemic levels until 2025 because of new regulations and a slow recovery in global travel.\n\nThe government hopes to diversify, on the way to building a high-income economy in the next decade. It is looking at opportunities not only in blockchain-based currencies but also fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics and biotechnology. The education system is also being reformed to emphasize critical thinking, creativity and digital literacy, with coding lessons for students aged 8 and up.\n\nFor crypto miners, Bhutan's green and relatively low-cost energy supply, mainly from hydropower, makes it an attractive destination.\n\n\"We are excited to be working alongside DHI in accessing Bhutan's zero-emissions power to sustainably enable the blockchain technologies that will eventually form an immutable bedrock for a global store of value,\" said Jihan Wu, chairman of Bitdeer Technologies Group, in a media release earlier in May.\n\nMining operations accounting for the first 100 MW are expected to begin this September, before reaching 600 MW in the next three years. Power will be sold to the operator at a negotiated rate.\n\nAt 100 MW, the project would be country's single largest energy consumer, while at 600 MW it would use more energy than the rest of the nation combined. Bhutan's peak demand was recorded at around 488 MW in December 2021, according to records with the Bhutan Power Corporation.\n\nFarm produce for sale along the Thimphu-Paro highway: More than 50% of the Bhutanese population is engaged in agriculture. (Photo by Phuntsho Wangdi)\n\nBhutan has an installed capacity of about 2,400 MW and sells most of its river hydro generation to India in the summer. In winter, it imports electricity when generation dwindles to about 414 MW. But the consistent supply is set to increase once a new 118 MW power plant comes online later this year, and a 1,020 MW facility opens in October 2024.\n\nFor now, the seasonal variation in power generation has been considered in the Bitdeer agreement, with domestic requirements to receive first priority and operations to shut in winter when generation dips.\n\nAlthough Bhutan's equity in the project will be small, the arrangement promises to create a source of dollars from the sale of power, taxes and profit-sharing. The plan is to use the funds to further strengthen the electric grid and telecom network.\n\nThe project is also expected to create between 300 to 400 jobs for Bhutanese and open up a \"whole new vertical within which we can set up resource centers to look more closely at blockchain and asset design, and communicate with our university to build R&D projects,\" said DHI's Dahal.\n\nThe excitement, however, comes with some trepidation over using national resources to enter an unpredictable industry that few truly understand. Other countries that have jumped into crypto mining have run into problems. In the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, a sudden boom in crypto mining strained the power grid, leading to localized blackouts and contributing to the protests that rocked the country in January 2022.\n\nSome countries, including former industry leader China, have banned mining because of the vast amounts of energy needed to sustain the operations.\n\nThen there is the volatility of the currencies to consider. In 2021, the value of Bitcoin crashed from $68,000 to $17,000. This year it was back above $30,000 at one point.\n\nIn April, Bhutan's DHI itself came under fire when the bankruptcy of BlockFi, a crypto trading platform, revealed that it had been secretly investing and trading in digital assets. Dahal acknowledged that Bhutan had entered the market when Bitcoin was trading at around $5,000 in 2019.\n\nThe 17th-century Tashichho Dzong in the Thimphu valley is the seat of Bhutan's central government, which aims to create a high-income economy in the next decade. (Photo by Phuntsho Wangdi)\n\nDahal insisted that DHI is aware of the pitfalls. \"We have a robust risk framework in place, and we need to take care of what is under our control, which is to operate the mine as efficiently as possible,\" he said. \"And with Bitdeer as our partner, we are confident of being able to do that well.\"\n\nMany in Bhutan view Bitcoin mining as a risk worth taking, since the currency's finite supply makes it a rare commodity -- and therefore desirable, at least in theory. Of the 21 million possible Bitcoins, more than 19 million have already been mined, a fact expected to pump up demand for the remainder. Many are also counting on cryptocurrencies becoming mainstream.\n\n\"When it comes to crypto mining, Bhutan should get into it,\" said Tshering Cigay, the former CEO of the Thimphu Techpark, an IT development hub. He said that during his tenure, Techpark received several international proposals for setting up mining farms.\n\n\"Bhutan should take advantage of its competitive edge and diversify its energy market,\" Cigay said, although he cautioned, \"When it comes to trading, it is hard to say.\""

        "title": "Could Bitcoin Help You Become a Millionaire? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Since July 2010 (the earliest data available from coinmarketcap.com), Bitcoin has produced a ridiculous return of nearly 43,000,000%. That crushes the gains of both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index by insanely wide margins. And it has no doubt made some early adopters extremely wealthy.\n\nEven though Bitcoin has been around for about 14 years, I don't think it's too late to get in on the action. Right now, the price is 61% off its all-time high from November 2021, so there is some heightened pessimism around this top cryptocurrency. But can buying now help you become a millionaire?\n\nGiven enough time, I believe the answer is a resounding \"yes.\"\n\nThere is a clear need for Bitcoin\n\nIt's important to first take a step back and understand why Bitcoin is even needed in the world. Think about citizens dealing with corrupt governments (like Mexico's), or currencies that experience hyperinflation (like in Venezuela), or countries ravaged by war (like Afghanistan). The people in these places can't rely on the current financial systems that are in place. A decentralized form of money that can't be confiscated, that isn't controlled by anyone, and that can be stored on the internet or devices that connect to the web is extremely valuable in these types of situations.\n\nIn the U.S., skeptics would make the argument that there is no need for Bitcoin because we have a robust payments industry and developed capital markets. This misses the point that Bitcoin is a global network. Moreover, we take our working financial infrastructure for granted, while people in other countries struggle with a lack of basic banking services or stable currency.\n\nPlus, Bitcoin does serve a need in the U.S. Some investors and institutions are keen on holding a portion of their wealth in the world's most valuable cryptocurrency. That's because Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million, yet over the past decade, central banks around the world have pumped so much money into the economy to stimulate growth after the Great Recession and throughout the coronavirus pandemic. The more fiat money, or government-backed currency, that there is relative to Bitcoin, the better the prospects for the latter's price appreciation.\n\nThe staggering debt burden of the U.S., which will only be exacerbated by further increases of the national debt ceiling in the future, also tells me that we can't keep interest rates high for too long. This increases the odds of elevated levels of inflation for extended periods of time. Holding Bitcoin makes even more sense with this in mind.\n\nRunning the numbers\n\nBitcoin has a market cap of about $516 billion. But let's say that a decade from now, its entire value equals that of the total value of all the world's gold, or roughly $12.5 trillion. I don't think this scenario is out of the question. As more individuals, corporations, and governments learn about Bitcoin and its attractive properties, it's probable that they would at least store a small fraction of their investable assets or reserves in it.\n\nThis would mean that Bitcoin's price would rise about 25-fold between now and the summer of 2033. This performance would likely crush what investors could earn putting their money in the stock market (or any asset class, for that matter). This projection suggests that a $40,000 investment in Bitcoin today could make someone a millionaire in 10 years' time.\n\nTo be clear, there are a ton of risks to think about. The most pressing one is the threat of governments banning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, making it illegal to buy and own these digital assets. That's something to always keep in mind. Additionally, Bitcoin simply might not be adopted as widely as many hope.\n\nBitcoin could reach that projected value in a much longer time frame, or maybe not at all. The range of outcomes is vast.\n\nNonetheless, the potential is certainly there for Bitcoin to make you a millionaire."

Historically, halving events have sparked significant interest and bullish sentiment among investors, often leading to notable price surges.\n\nBased on historical moves, market experts predict Bitcoin's price will surpass $100,000 in 2024. However, the impact of the 2024 halving will depend on many factors, including market adoption, regulatory developments, pending decisions on Bitcoin Spot ETF, and broader economic conditions.\n\nEvent Date Reward (BTC) Mined (BTC) Launch January 2009 50 10,500,000 Halving 1 November 2012 25 5,250,000 Halving 2 July 2016 12.5 2,625,000 Halving 3 May 2020 6.25 1,312,500 Halving 4 March 2024 3.125 656,250 Halving 5 Expected 2028 1.5625 328,125 Halving 6 Expected 2032 0.78125 164,063\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction Post Halving - See What\u2019s in store for BTC Price in 2024; Expert Prediction and Key Updates - Read More\n\nWhy does Bitcoin halving happen?\n\nControlled Supply: As mining rewards decrease, miners rely more on transaction fees, helping to keep the Bitcoin network secure and sustainable in the long run.\n\nAs mining rewards decrease, miners rely more on transaction fees, helping to keep the Bitcoin network secure and sustainable in the long run.

Network Security and Miner Incentive: As mining rewards decrease, miners rely more on transaction fees, helping to keep the Bitcoin network secure and sustainable in the long run.\n\nHow Bitcoin Halving Takes Place?\n\nBitcoin halving is a process designed to control the creation of new Bitcoins and help regulate the total supply. Here's a simple example to explain how it works:\n\nImagine a small village where gold mining is the primary source of income. Every four years, the village council decides to reduce the amount of gold each miner finds by half. Initially, miners find 100 grams of gold per day. After four years, this amount is reduced to 50 grams per day, then 25 grams after another four years, and so on.\n\nIn the Bitcoin network, something similar happens. The Bitcoin network is maintained by miners who use their computing power to process and secure transactions. In return, they are rewarded with new Bitcoins.\n\nInitially, when miners successfully added a block of transactions to the blockchain (Bitcoin's digital ledger), they were rewarded with 50 Bitcoins. However, this reward is halved every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years). So, after the first 210,000 blocks, the reward was reduced to 25 Bitcoins, then to 12.5 Bitcoins after the following 210,000 blocks, and so on.\n\nThis mechanism is fundamental to Bitcoin's design to ensure its scarcity and value over time. It's like the village council's decision to reduce the gold output, ensuring that gold remains valuable because it becomes more scarce.\n\nImpact of Bitcoin Halving on Miners\n\nThe impact of Bitcoin halving on miners is significant and multifaceted. The reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks is halved. This means miners receive 50% less Bitcoin for every block they successfully mine than before the halving.\n\nHere are some of the critical impacts of this event on miners:\n\nReduced profitability: Bitcoin halving cuts mining rewards, challenging the financial sustainability of miners with high operating costs and potentially leading to a concentration of mining power among larger, more efficient players. Increased competition The decrease in rewards forces miners to optimize operations and innovate, spurring a competitive environment that may favor larger, more technologically advanced mining operations. Bitcoin Price volatility Halving events typically influence Bitcoin's market value, often causing price increases before the event and notable fluctuations afterwards, reflecting changes in supply expectations. Increased focus on transaction fees As mining rewards dwindle, miners increasingly rely on transaction fees, which might impact the network's scalability and user costs, potentially leading to higher fees and longer transaction times. Drive for Mining Innovation The need for cost-effective mining solutions post-halving could accelerate innovation in the sector, prompting exploration into renewable energy sources and more efficient mining algorithms. Enhanced Network Security Reduced rewards can motivate miners to invest in more efficient technologies, potentially leading to a more secure and robust Bitcoin network.\n\nEach halving event is unique, and various factors, including the state of the broader economy, technological advancements in mining, and changes in regulatory landscapes, can influence its impact. The long-term effects of halving are complex and can vary based on how miners and the broader Bitcoin community adapt to these changes."

        "title": "Delaware Bankruptcy Court Approves DIP Financing of 700 Bitcoin - The National Law Review",
        "content": "On May 8, 2023, online cryptocurrency exchange platform Bittrex, Inc. and three of its affiliated entities (collectively \u201cBittrex\u201d) filed for chapter 11 to wind down their U.S. and long-dormant Malta operations. The bankruptcy filing followed costly regulatory investigations and an April 17, 2023 SEC enforcement action alleging that Bittrex improperly sold crypto assets that were securities. Unlike other crypto bankruptcies, Bittrex did not risk, hypothecate, or loan cryptocurrencies needed to meet its contractual obligations to its customers. Instead, since March 31, 2023, Bittrex had been urging its 5.4 million customers to withdraw their cryptocurrency deposits. Bittrex\u2019s ultimate goal in its case is to pay all customer\u2019s claims in full as soon as possible.\n\nWhat is particularly interesting about the Bittrex case is that for the first time, on June 7, 2023, a bankruptcy court authorized a debtor to obtain postpetition financing solely in bitcoin (\u201cBTC\u201d) from the DIP lender.\n\nDIP Financing Motion\n\nBittrex filed a postpetition financing motion on the petition date requesting that Bittrex\u2019s ultimate parent company, Aquila Holdings Inc. (\u201cAquila\u201d), be authorized to issue a DIP loan of 700 BTC to Bittrex. The DIP financing agreement provides that Aquila is entitled to a non-priming, super-priority administrative claim pursuant to section 364(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (i.e., higher priority over any and all administrative expense claims), but does not grant Aquila a security interest in any of Bittrex\u2019s assets. Bittrex intends to use the DIP loan to fund the bankruptcy case and make distributions of cryptocurrency holdings to its former customers.\n\nThere were several reasons why Aquila required the DIP loan to consist exclusively of BTC rather than fiat currency. First, in the crypto industry it is common for participants to borrow funds in BTC. Second, after fiat banking services provider Silvergate Bank closed, it became very difficult for a cryptocurrency firm in wind-down mode to access fiat currency. And perhaps most importantly, Aquila would face negative tax consequences if it was required to liquidate its BTC, which would greatly increase the expense of Bittrex\u2019s DIP loan.\n\nAccording to the financing motion, once Bittrex receives the BTC from Aquila, Bittrex will promptly convert the BTC into U.S. dollars to minimize the risk of currency rate fluctuations. Bittrex will then use the BTC proceeds to pay administrative expenses in accordance with the budget attached to the motion. Bittrex will need to repay the DIP loan principal no later than nine months after the interim order was entered (i.e., February 10, 2024), and the principal portion of the DIP loan must be repaid in BTC. Any other obligations, like the 4% interest per annum, may be repaid in BTC, U.S. dollars, or any combination thereof. To protect Bittrex against BTC price fluctuations between the time of borrowing and maturity, Bittrex negotiated a cap on the amount of additional BTC it may need to acquire to pay any shortfall. Specifically, Bittrex is only required to pay Aquila BTC equal to 110% of the value of the shortfall on the petition date. In other words, Bittrex is protected in the event the price of BTC rises after the petition date by only needing to pay Aquila up to 110% of the value of BTC advanced on the petition date.\n\nFor example, on the petition date the value of BTC in U.S. dollars was $28,611.44. The DIP loan is for 700 BTC, which means that on the maturity date Bittrex needs to repay 700 BTC to Aquila. If the price of BTC remained stable during the nine-month period, then Bittrex would need $20,028,008 worth of BTC to repay the DIP loan. But because the price of BTC constantly changes, if the price per BTC skyrockets following the petition date, Bittrex would only need to pay Aquila $22,030,808.80 of BTC (i.e., 110% of the value of BTC on the petition date) to satisfy the principal obligation, thus capping its risk.\n\nTakeaways\n\nBittrex\u2019s DIP financing is relatively non-controversial \u2013 it does not include a rollup, does not prime any preexisting debt, does not impose a security interest against any assets, only includes a 4% interest rate per annum, meaningfully caps any upside Aquila may receive for postpetition increases in BTC valuation, and authorizes Bittrex to recognize any price savings if the value of BTC falls after the petition date. What may appear to be unique, at least for bankruptcy purposes, is that the loan is in BTC, although entities in the crypto industry commonly lend and borrow cryptocurrencies from one another. As crypto firms continue to file bankruptcy, Bittrex\u2019s DIP facility may serve as a template for firms that intend to borrow BTC or other cryptocurrencies to finance their cases.\n\nBankruptcy practitioners can now seek to expand the scenarios for when BTC or other cryptocurrency DIP financing is acceptable in other cases. Debtors may begin to seek financing with more obscure cryptocurrencies or negotiate more complicated risk-transferring procedures to account for postpetition currency valuation fluctuations. For example, to obtain a lower interest rate or more value, debtors may agree to (i) a higher cap for a lender to obtain a larger principal payment (when valuations increase postpetition), and/or (ii) limit the floor of how large of a principal discount the debtor may obtain (when valuations drop postpetition).\n\nThe future has just begun to present creative cryptocurrency DIP financing solutions to debtors and lenders."
