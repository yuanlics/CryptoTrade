        "title": "The deadline for a ruling on Ark's application for a bitcoin ETF is near - CNBC",
        "content": "Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nIt's put up or shut up time for the SEC on a bitcoin ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission is required to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to ARK's application for a bitcoin ETF by Aug. 13. Eight other organizations, including BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, and WisdomTree, have also filed applications for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nYes, no or punt?\n\nArk's application for a spot bitcoin ETF was published in the Federal Register on May 15. A June 15 filing in the Federal Register from the SEC designated Aug. 13 \"as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.\" However, the SEC can extend the deadline to a maximum of 240 days. At its maximum, the SEC could theoretically delay a final response until Jan. 10, 2024 for the Ark application, and until March 2024 for the others, according to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, which has an application in front of the SEC. Get in line: Bitcoin ETF applications\n\n(Date filed & Last possible review) Ark/21 Shares Bitcoin Trust 5/15/23 1/10/24\n\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust 7/18/23 3/15/24\n\nBlackRock Bitcoin ETF Trust 7/19/23 3/16/24\n\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust 7/19/23 3/16/24\n\nWisdomTree Bitcoin Trust 7/19/23 3/16/24\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund 7/19/23 3/16/24\n\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF 7/19/23 3/16/24\n\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust 7/19/23 3/16/24 A ninth organization, Grayscale, has filed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a Bitcoin Spot ETF. Approvals would be simultaneous Given the \"first mover\" advantage would be tremendous, many are now arguing that if a bitcoin ETF is ultimately approved by the SEC, all the applications should be approved at once. That's exactly what Grayscale said in a recent letter to the SEC. \"[T]he SEC's actions related to bitcoin ETFs should be made in a fair and orderly manner.\" the letter said. \"As a disclosure-based regulator, the SEC should not pick winners and losers.\"\n\n'Surveillance sharing agreement'\n\nThe SEC has denied all prior spot bitcoin ETF applications, citing fraud and manipulation in the underlying markets. It has approved bitcoin ETF futures. The current crop of applications have a new wrinkle: a \"surveillance sharing\" agreement with exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe.\n\nwatch now\n\nThis would allow for the sharing of information about market trading activity, clearing activity, and customer identification, which would reduce the chances for market manipulation. It would also seek to ensure that investor assets cannot be diverted by the exchange to an unauthorized party, which was an issue with FTX. It's not clear if these changes would be sufficient to cause the SEC to approve a spot bitcoin ETF. The SEC has reportedly said the new applications were inadequate, and exchanges have been scrambling to update their filings to address the SEC's concerns.\n\nForcing the SEC's hand\n\nMany believe that the SEC will not move unless it is forced to do so. Supporters of a spot bitcoin ETF have been emboldened by a court case unfolding between Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the SEC. Grayscale has sued the SEC over its refusal to allow the trust to convert to a bitcoin ETF. The SEC cited familiar concerns over market manipulation. During hearings on the case in March, a panel of judges in the D.C. Court of Appeals in Washington pressed the SEC on why it had denied the application, noting that the commission had previously approved bitcoin futures agreements which also had surveillance agreements in them. \"It seems like it's fine for an agency to say OK, we need some more information, but it seems there's quite a bit of information here on how these markets work together, and the SEC has not offered any explanation ... that the petitioners here are wrong,\" Judge Neomi Rao said. Bitcoin supporters have been cheering Graycale's efforts. \"They're forcing the SEC through a legal process, to provide clarity,\" Purpose Investments CEO Som Seif told me. Seif runs the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, a spot bitcoin ETF that has been trading in Canada since February, 2021. \"I think that that's a really important thing, because through the regulatory and legal process, they will be forced to actually give very specific reasons and actually back those reasons... [SEC Chairman Gary Gensler] is going to keep kicking the can down the road until he's otherwise forced to say, 'Here's why.'\"\n\nGaming the odds\n\nWhile many in the crypto community are putting on a game face, others are doubtful, noting that Gensler seems implacably opposed to approving a spot bitcoin ETF. \"We're not going to see a spot bitcoin ETF any time soon,\" Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professional (DACFP), told CNBC at a recent conference. \"We would love a bitcoin ETF,\" Edelman said. \"It's the simplest, easiest, cheapest, most liquid affordable way to invest in bitcoin. But the SEC has rejected every Bitcoin ETF application for the past 10 years.\" Others believe the environment is changing. The crypto community took note that the SEC approved a 2x leveraged Bitcoin ETF (BITX) in June, and there has recently been a rush of applications for an ethereum futures ETF. Last week, Bloomberg Intelligence's James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas put the odds of a bitcoin ETF approval at 65%, noting, among other things, the SEC's poor showing in the Grayscale litigation.\n\nwatch now"

        "title": "Cathie Wood on Bitcoin ETF, Tesla and China Market - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nYou know, you are also involved in you've got your own filing for physical physically backed Bitcoin ETF. Do you think that the excitement there has driven up prices across crypto? I mean, today is a down day, but we're still looking at $29,000 for Bitcoin. Yes, I do think that in June, when BlackRock announced its filing or when it was announced that BlackRock had filed for a Bitcoin ETF, the Bitcoin price did shoot up and but has been fairly stable since then. So I do think it's had an impact, A bigger impact this year was the regional bank crisis. It was very interesting to watch Bitcoin go from 19000 to 30000 right in the middle of that banking crisis as regional banks were going bankrupt. So it was a flight to safety. So I thought that move was just as interesting on a flight to safety. Is buying Bitcoin somehow a flight to safety? Isn't it a little too volatile for that? Well, if you think about it, Bitcoin serves as two kinds of hedges. One is a hedge against inflation and outright confiscation of wealth. The other is against counterparty risk. And I, you know, was when the regional banks started going down this fear sort of, you know, memory. Our memories are fresh with oh eight or nine. The counterparty risk became real. And so there was this flight into Bitcoin, a completely decentralized, transparent network which is not subject to counterparty risk. Kathy So you are in this race. Let's talk about the race a little bit. The first important deadline coming up is August 13th, where the Ark filing the SC is either going to delay it, which we think they'll probably delay it. And then BlackRock is later. You filed before BlackRock but BlackRock came in with the surveillance sharing agreement with Coinbase that was novel. Right now we're looking in the future there's talk of a common clock where the SCC could approve a whole bunch of ETFs at once, putting you on a level playing field with BlackRock and others. What's your take on how this will play out given you filed earlier? I think you're probably right that August 13th will come and go and I think I think the SCC, if it's going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once. So then again, because most of these essentially will be the same and it will come down to marketing, communicating the message. You know, we've been putting out our Bitcoin monthly for the for the last year. We are now starting a Bitcoin brainstorming session. Our first one we launched last Thursday. So we're trying to get the word out there that, you know, our research is deep and we've been doing it since 2015 when we gained our first exposure to BTC. We were the first public asset manager to gain exposure to Bitcoin at all in 2015. That's exactly where I want to go. The grayscale Bitcoin trust known by its ticker gbtc. If you look at our W, for example, your ARK next generation Internet ETF. Right now I see GBTC as the third largest holding. If we are in a situation where the SEC does give its blessing for a spot Bitcoin ETF, would you plan to sell out of gbtc and buy one of these physically backed funds? So I cannot talk about what we would and would not do. And in fact, our compliance team is, you know, giving us marching orders not to talk very much about this filing and its aftermath at all. So just the fact that we filed with our partner 21 shares is is as far as I can go. So sorry, Katie. Fair enough. No. I was expecting something along those lines. I am curious to get your take on the regulatory temperature right now, because in addition to this rush of spot Bitcoin ETF filings that we've seen, there's also been sort of a race that's unfolding for an ETHER futures ETF. There's been a ton of filings to that effect and not specific to those funds. But do you sense that the mood, mood music around the SEC and what their appetite to allow these products to launch has changed in the last several months? Well, I think that that the two other branches of government, the judicial branch and the legislative branch are giving the FCC pause because the FCC is losing cases in court having to do with its regulations. Around crypto. That's the first thing. And there are bills that are making their way through the House and are seeing some bipartisan support. So I do believe that. Gary Gensler, I guess last week or ten days ago said something like, Well, you know, I'm not the only one who makes this decision. There are five commissioners. Now, of course, we know they're weighted towards the Democrats, two Democrats, two Republicans. And so one assumes that the way that Gary votes is the way that the FCC will vote. But he seemed to be distancing himself a little bit. And so maybe we can take that as a bit of a clue. We definitely did. We thought that was a good sign. But, you know, we're reading all kinds of tea leaves in this. Let me ask you about Coinbase, because you have increased your position in Coinbase. It's also who your surveillance sharing agreement is with. Also, how much is it? How important is it that Coinbase is a bridge or compliant enough for the SEC in terms of working with traditional finance? Is your bullishness on this stock that they are going to be sort of the traditional finance bridge or is it other you know, you think people are going to continue trading crypto on Coinbase? No actual both. We we think that it is the most regulatory compliant exchange out there and we've been very pleased with how its derivatives exchange in Bermuda has ramped in here. It's very early days, but again, clearly a trusted partner and and we are also seeing that there's more turmoil out there, I guess to be I think that's how you just say the name of the exchange and tether and finance. There are still there are rumblings out there that not is all all is well. And so coin Coinbase is going to be the flight to safety exchange, no doubt about it. And do you think this surveillance agreement with Coinbase are going to be enough to deal with things like price manipulation in this market? I mean, that's been one of the main concerns from the SEC lawyers with with whom we've spoken. Well, what I find so interesting still, and this is why we believe that the FCC will lose the grayscale case, how can you approve a Bitcoin futures ETF and and not a Bitcoin ETF? And and in fact, if you're really thinking about consumer protection, a futures ETF swaps space. So there's counterparty risk there that you would not have with a Bitcoin ETF which is backed 1 to 1 with Bitcoin in Coinbase is called storage. It still confounds me. And not to mention that the point that Eric makes, which is that if there had been an ETF, a lot of people wouldn't have bought Bitcoin at stocks and instead would use the article. Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn is stepping down after more than 13 years at Tesla. Curious to hear your reaction given how long you've been involved in the stock, how long he's been there, does this give you any pause? Well, we all loved Zack and love Zack and think he will do very well wherever he goes. I, I, I know there are rumors out that there are some CTO positions out there which he might like to take, so we will miss him. But his successor has been with Tesla right underneath him since 2018. So he was put through the fires, remember, in 2018, 19. And many, many analysts were saying that Tesla was going bankrupt, too. And so he's been there. He's gone through the fire. And, you know, it's a tough job. It's a tough, tough job. So I I guess 13 years was a really good run for Zach. And I can't say enough good things about him and what he did for Tesla, but I think he trained his successor well. That's great to hear. Do you expect Tesla to build 2 million vehicles this year? I think it's incredible how they've grown production and it looks like they can do that. What are your expectations for their growth from here on out? Well, as you know, we have a five year investment time horizon. And and we do think this cycle for autos is going to get tougher in here generally. But we think just like last year when electric vehicles were up 69% or 65%, something like that, and gas powered vehicles down 7% globally. We think we're going to continue to see that share shift accelerate because. Electric vehicle prices are going to follow the court their costs down in a way that gas powered cars cannot. So we think that electric vehicles will be less expensive and they are better cars than gas powered vehicles. So we think they're going to take tremendous share. And even if the auto market relapses in here, which we think it could, we don't think electric vehicles will relapse. So we think the 1.8 million for this year, which was Elon, said 1.8 to 2 million, they're going to have some shut downs in the third quarter for maintenance and upgrades. And so he lowered he lowered his expectation to the lower end of that range. I think he likes to lower expectations and then be. So I wouldn't be surprised if it's higher than that. BNN Bloomberg New Economy Forum has voiced concerns about the availability of cobalt and lithium, and is there enough to continue making electric cars for the masses, as some producers like GM are building, you know, massive 200 kilowatt batteries for their trucks? Is that a concern for you at all? Do you think Tesla has the production locked in? Well, I know very early on they they said to their suppliers, you know, if if you will build it, we will buy it. So, yes, they've been in a preferred position and probably still are. They're also very smart. Tesla's engineers are very smart. They are engineering cobalt out of the cars. They're doing it for a few reasons. The supply is uncertain and it's very focused in, I guess, the Congo, where there are a lot of environmental and governance and social concerns. So they're engineering it out and they're moving into. And you should on lithium, actually, if you look at the price, it went up tenfold in two years and now it's down about 40% from that peak. I think lithium is one of the most pervasive minerals out there. So we don't think lithium is an issue at all, especially now that the Chinese and the Koreans and all of the U.S. OEMs are are basically telling lithium miners, just just build it and we will take it. So and then the other interesting thing is, again, this is Tesla leading the charge, so to speak, in this category, lithium ion phosphate. So taking out the nickel and other metals that may end up in short supply, especially if we get into very strong cycles and the lithium ion iron phosphate is a much lower priced or will lead to a much lower price car as well. Cathie, real quick, I wanted to get in the superconductor. This is something that's been in our team is getting obsessed about. You are an innovation fund. I'm guessing you're looking at this. How much of this is hype and hope versus a potential legit reality and how do you play it? Well, it was interesting when when the news broke a little more than a week ago and many people just thought it was a fraud. But our chief futurist, Brett Winton, said, wait a minute, this is not a fraud. It can't be a fraud because it's so simple. You you can buy from, you can buy, you can buy phosphorus, copper. And there was one other ingredient there, and you could actually follow their instructions and duplicate this. We're going to find out pretty quickly. And what it does seem is that it is possible. So we went from thinking Friday a week ago, oh, maybe ten, 15% chance to now, while the markets the betting markets are up 40%, I think we're more in the 60% plus range. So and you know, it could it could be the breakthrough we need for quantum computing or at least bringing it into reality from a commercialization point of view sooner than expected or or those high speed trains, it could change so many things, and particularly our electric system where, you know, we lose so much heat in data centers, where we lose so much energy because of the inefficiencies associated with current electricity. Cathy, I promised Florida, but I actually want to start in China and get your current views on what the stock market there looks like because a few years ago you were out and I think you came back. A little bit. And JD.com. What's your current thinking around the equity market in China and what opportunities are there or not? Well, we're we're maintaining our position. Really common prosperity suggests that the government is aiming for for companies not to be too profitable, but to really help the country to expand and make the lives of everyone better, which is noble. That's what we all want is to, you know, shrink the divide between the rich and the poor. We are focused on a few things there. We're focused on the fact that China is exporting deflation. It's down for 5.4%. And it is one reason that we think that the world is going to face more of a deflationary period here than I think most people think. It's also very interesting to watch the yuan. I think that the government would be stimulating more aggressively if the yen were a little stronger and it has been weakening and they're very careful about their currency. So I don't think they're going to be able to stimulate as much as many people might like or expect because the yuan is showing some fundamental weakness here. And you know what's so interesting about that? Sorry, I just want to add an exclamation point here. The fact that they're exporting deflation and they're the yuan is down. That's that's a double whammy. That is that from from from China's point of view, you know, the fact to see deflation as their currency is down, Normally when a currency is down, you see inflation. So, Kathy, we know you moved to Florida from New York City. I believe you were in the Chelsea neighborhood. I visited your office way back in the day. Yes. You're now down in Florida. A lot of asset managers, a lot of people who watch Bloomberg TV are considering moves like this. How has it changed your investing process, if at all? Being there? Are there pros and cons to being in Florida versus in New York City? I guess the the the there's for us no change in our investment process. Covid told us we could work remotely and so we have a hybrid setup, but we do have rotations of all of the teams through Saint Petersburg, Florida, and even more so during the winter, I might add. So that's working out. But I think it's it's it's been a wonderful place for us and it's great to have everyone come together, either in various teams or all together like reunions. So it's working pretty well for us. We only have a few seconds left, so I'll just ask a short question. Elon Musk and Zuckerberg may have a cage match fight. Do you have do you take a side in that in that fight? Do you do you think Musk is up to the task? I whenever he puts his mind to something, I wouldn't I wouldn't bet against him. That's what I'll say. But I did read this morning that he's saying that or tweeting that he has to probably go for a back operation first for something to having to do with his disks. So I would I would hope that he would wait until he's completely on the mend."

        "title": "Pensioner gives up fight with bank to deposit massive bitcoin savings - CTech",
        "content": "Almost two years after pensioner Esther Freeman, who made around a million shekels (approximately $270,000) from Bitcoin, sued Bank Hapoalim on the grounds that it refused to allow her to deposit the profits into her account , the lawsuit against the bank has been dismissed. According to a request submitted on behalf of the parties to the Tel Aviv District Court, they declared that \"after a conversation between the plaintiff and the defendant bank, they reached an agreement according to which the lawsuit against Bank Hapoalim will be dismissed, and each party will bear its own expenses.\" Judge Limor Bibi approved the request on Sunday.\n\nSince filing the lawsuit, Bitcoin\u2019s price has fallen by around 50%.\n\n1 View gallery Esther Freeman. ( Photo: Haim Horenshtein )\n\nIn November 2021, Freeman filed a lawsuit against Bank Hapoalim, explaining that in 2013 she purchased Bitcoin in the amount of NIS 10,000 on the advice of family members. In July 2021, Esther asked to convert some of the Bitcoin, which was being traded at the time at around $58,000 into fiat money. \"I'm young in spirit,\" she said. \"I listened to my son and nephews and decided to give it a shot. I had no prior knowledge on the matter and was completely naive. I never dreamed that NIS 10,000 could become almost NIS 1 million.\"\n\nHowever, the fairytale story didn\u2019t reach a happy ending. Freeman filed a lawsuit at the Tel Aviv District Court in November 2021 through attorneys Shaul Zioni and Lior Kiperman of the Zioni, Pillersdorf, Phillip Advocates law firm against Bank Hapoalim after it refused to deposit the funds she amassed through her Bitcoin investment. Freeman has held an account at the bank for the past 40 years, but the bank claims that it refuses to accept the funds as Freeman had purchased the Bitcoin in cash, and therefore it has no way of verifying the money route.\n\n\"The characteristics of digital currencies allow for them to be transferred in an anonymous and unregulated manner, many times circumventing the need to use financial institutions who are under anti-money laundering and terror financing regulations, and therefore this is an activity that carries a high risk of anti-money laundering and terror financing,\" the bank wrote in a letter sent to Freeman.\n\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, the bank filed a statement of defense through attorney Meir Lefler. The bank claimed, among other things, \u201cthat on the relevant dates, and even at the time of writing these lines, the position of the Supervisor of Banks is that the banking system should not be required to accept funds originating from virtual currencies, and this in light of the risk involved in exploiting this means for money laundering and terrorist financing.\"\n\nAs part of the statement of defense, Bank Hapoalim explained that according to \"Freeman's explanations, it is not possible to trace the money path in relation to the purchase of the virtual currency\u201d and that \u201conly in cases where the funds used to purchase the virtual currency were withdrawn and received in the same account can the receipt of the funds be approved.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank also stated that Freeman did not make the purchase from a recognized and/or supervised entity but from a private individual in cash. The bank claimed that under the aforementioned circumstances, the bank should not be forced to accept funds originating in virtual currency contrary to its risk management in this area. On the other hand, the pensioner claimed that the bank's claims are unfounded. As mentioned, today the court, with the consent of the parties, ordered the deletion of the claim against the bank.\n\nBank Hapoalim stated: \"The lawsuit against the bank has been dismissed. The bank acted from the beginning in accordance with its obligations according to law, including the Anti-Money Laundering Law.\""

        "title": "Lost Bitcoins: \u201cThink of It as a Donation to Everyone\u201d - DailyCoin",
        "content": "Satoshi Nakamoto said lost Bitcoins \u201conly make everyone else\u2019s coins worth slightly more.\u201d To his credit, it\u2019s hard to disagree.\n\nBut how does Bitcoin (BTC) even get lost in the first place? Everyone and their dog knows that backing up your private keys and seed phrase is the first thing you do when you create a crypto wallet. Are Bitcoin users really that careless?\n\nHow much BTC has already been condemned to collect cobwebs and dust in inaccessible addresses until the end of time?\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore the fate of these lost, but not forgotten, digital assets and their impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nWhat Happens to Lost Bitcoins?\n\nIn the labyrinth of the digital world, lost Bitcoins find themselves in limbo. Until the death of the network itself, misplaced BTC lies dormant on the blockchain, the public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions.\n\nWhen Bitcoins are lost, they essentially become inaccessible. This typically happens when the private keys or recovery phrases to a Bitcoin wallet are forgotten, cast aside, or missing in action.\n\nWithout these keys, bitcoins are doomed to remain in their respective wallets, untouched and unmovable, like a locked vault whose key has been misplaced.\n\nTo rub salt into the wound, these lost Bitcoins are not removed from the total supply count. They continue to exist on the blockchain but are effectively removed from circulation, as they can no longer be spent, sold, or traded.\n\nHow Many Bitcoins Are Lost?\n\nLike counting stars in the sky or grains of sand at the beach, counting the number of Bitcoins rumored to be lost forever is no easy task.\n\nChainalysis, a leading blockchain research firm, speculates that up to 20% of the total supply of Bitcoins may be lost forever. Of course, this isn\u2019t an exact science. According to the firm, any Bitcoin wallet that hasn\u2019t signed a transaction in the last five years is considered \u2018lost,\u2019 along with any remaining Bitcoin still inside.\n\nThis translates to a rough estimate of around four million BTC, a staggering figure considering that the total supply of Bitcoins is capped at 21 million. As the years go by, the number of lost Bitcoins continues to rise, adding another layer of mystery and intrigue to the enigmatic world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow Bitcoin Gets Lost\n\nToday, the idea of accidentally losing such a valuable asset seems ridiculous. However, the loss of these digital assets is more common than one might think and can occur in several ways.\n\nForgotten or Lost Private Keys\n\nThe most common cause of Bitcoin loss is people forgetting their private keys or seed phrases, essentially digital passwords granting access to a Bitcoin wallet. If a user forgets these keys or loses the device where the key is stored, the Bitcoins within the wallet become inaccessible.\n\nDeath of the Bitcoin Owner\n\nIn some unfortunate instances, a Bitcoin owner may pass away without leaving behind the necessary information to access their digital wallet. If this happens, their Bitcoin wallet becomes completely inaccessible.\n\nHardware Failure or Loss\n\nBitcoins are often stored in hardware wallets, physical devices designed to store private keys offline securely. However, if these devices are damaged, lost, or stolen, and the owner has not backed up their seed phrase, the BTC stored on the device can be lost.\n\nSending to Incorrect Addresses\n\nBlockchain transactions are irreversible. If a user accidentally sends BTC to the wrong address, it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll never get them back. This can happen if a user mistypes the address or their computer is infected with malware that alters the copied address.\n\nUnused Wallets\n\nSome early Bitcoin mining enthusiasts or buyers purchased BTC when it was worth mere cents and then forgot about them. As the value of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, like Ethereum (ETH), rose, some users found they had lost access to their wallets.\n\nThe most tragic example of this tells the story of James Howells, who threw away 8,000 BTC after accidentally tossing a hard drive in the trash. Today, this hard drive holds over $250 million worth of Bitcoin, crushed underneath mounds of rubbish in a landfill.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Bitcoin\u2019s Price?\n\nUnlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins. BTC\u2019s scarcity and inflation resistance are critical factors underpinning its value. What happens when a portion of this already limited supply becomes inaccessible?\n\nLet\u2019s go back to Economics 101. In simple economic terms, when the supply of an asset decreases while demand remains constant or increases, the price of that asset tends to rise. Like the Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn mechanism, lost crypto assets are permanently removed from the circulating supply.\n\nAs more Bitcoins are lost, the available supply decreases. If demand continues to grow, this could put upward pressure on the price of Bitcoin and fulfill Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s lost Bitcoin prophecy.\n\nHow to Avoid Losing Your Bitcoin\n\nIf it was apparent already, safeguarding your digital assets becomes increasingly critical. Here are some strategies to prevent your Bitcoin from becoming part of the lost bounty.\n\nBack up your private keys and seed phrase \u2013 These codes are the lifeline to your digital assets. Store them securely and make sure they are backed up in multiple locations. Consider using hardware wallets, which store your keys offline and are immune to online hacking attempts.\n\n\u2013 These codes are the lifeline to your digital assets.

They want your BTC. Learn about potential scams, and never share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone. Plan for the Unexpected \u2013 Make a plan to ensure your loved ones can access your Bitcoins. Most crypto exchanges offer estate planning and crypto inheritance services.\n\nIs Lost Bitcoin Recoverable?\n\nI hate to tell you this but lost Bitcoin cannot be recovered in most cases. Once the private keys to a Bitcoin wallet are lost, the Bitcoins within that wallet become inaccessible and are effectively lost forever. This is due to the cryptographic security measures inherent in blockchain technology, which make it impossible to access a wallet without the correct private keys.\n\nIf you have lost access to your BTC, like you\u2019ve misplaced your hardware wallet or forgotten your password, don\u2019t lose hope! If you\u2019ve backed up your seed phrase somewhere, you can recover your Bitcoin.\n\nProfessional data recovery services also attempt to recover lost Bitcoins, especially in cases where a user remembers part of their password or has an old computer or storage device that might contain traces of the lost keys.\n\nWhile recovering lost Bitcoins in specific scenarios is technically possible, it\u2019s generally a complex and uncertain process. When it comes to securing your digital wealth, prevention is the best defense.\n\nPros and Cons of Lost Bitcoin\n\nThe phenomenon of lost Bitcoin has positive and negative implications for the ecosystem and its users.\n\nPros\n\nIncreased Scarcity \u2013 Lost Bitcoins effectively reduce the circulating supply of the world\u2019s largest digital asset. By the laws of supply and demand, this could potentially drive up the price, benefiting those who hold Bitcoin.\n\n\u2013 Lost Bitcoins effectively reduce the circulating supply of the world\u2019s largest digital asset.

Security Lessons \u2013 The irreversible loss of Bitcoin is a crucial reminder of the importance of security in the digital asset space. It encourages us to adopt better security practices, such as secure storage of seed phrases and private keys.\n\nCons\n\nReduced Market Liquidity \u2013 Lost Bitcoins decrease the remaining BTC available for trading.

Loss of Value \u2013 For the individuals who lose their Bitcoins, the loss can be financially devastating, especially given the increasing value of Bitcoin.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nIf an early adopter wallet that was previously thought to be \u2018lost\u2019 were to be recovered, the owner could find themselves holding an immense allocation of BTC. This could have a disastrous effect on the crypto market if they decided to dump all their holdings. Imagine if Satoshi Nakamoto suddenly reappeared and sold 1M BTC?\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nLearning about the consequences of losing access to your crypto wallet is the perfect incentive to tighten your own blockchain security and back up your seed phrase. If you haven\u2019t already done it, let this serve as a timely reminder!\n\nFAQs"

        "title": "Cathie Wood Just Doubled Down On a $1.48 Million Price Target for Bitcoin. Is She Right? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In February, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest made headlines when she raised her firm's 2030 price target for Bitcoin (BTC -0.14%) from $1 million to an eye-popping $1.48 million. Now, six months later, she's doubling down on that price forecast, more convinced than ever that Bitcoin is on a trajectory to $1 million and beyond.\n\nSo is she right? Certainly, $1.48 million sounds like an outlandish forecast, even for Bitcoin. After all, Bitcoin is still trading around $30,000, nearly 60% below an all-time high of $68,789. But Wood says she has the numbers to back up her assertions, so let's dig in.\n\nBitcoin as safe haven\n\nAccording to Wood, Bitcoin is the perfect \"insurance policy\" for an uncertain economic world. What convinced her more than anything was Bitcoin's performance during the regional banking crisis earlier this year, when Bitcoin skyrocketed from $19,000 to $30,000. That nearly 60% gain signified to Wood that Bitcoin was increasingly being viewed as a safe haven in an unsafe world. During any \"flight to safety,\" investors would rush to move their money into Bitcoin.\n\nIn short, Bitcoin is once again being viewed as \"digital gold.\" Before the 2022 crypto market meltdown, it was commonplace to talk about Bitcoin as an alternative to physical gold, and as the ultimate store of value. According to Wood's bull case scenario, Bitcoin will eventually have a 50% share of the \"store of value\" market once dominated by gold.\n\nThat figure might sound high, but it lines up with what Goldman Sachs Group (GS 1.06%) predicted at the start of 2022. Back then, Goldman Sachs predicted that Bitcoin would eventually account for a larger and larger share of this market, rivaling gold. Based on that prediction, Goldman Sachs set a Bitcoin price target of $100,000.\n\nBitcoin and institutional investors\n\nCathie Wood's valuation model for Bitcoin also includes some key assumptions about the behavior of institutional investors. The key metric to watch here is their asset allocation to crypto, and specifically, Bitcoin. In her firm's bear case scenario for Bitcoin, this allocation stands at a relatively paltry 1%. But it climbs to 2.5% in the base case scenario, and then skyrockets to 6.5% in the bull case scenario.\n\nThe recent rush to file spot Bitcoin ETF applications with the SEC is perhaps the best sign yet of potential new institutional investor interest in Bitcoin. In mid-June, BlackRock (BLK -0.43%) led the way with a spot Bitcoin ETF filing. Soon after, Ark Invest followed with an amended application for a similar type of spot Bitcoin ETF filing. No surprise here, but Bitcoin rallied hard in June after these announcements. These spot Bitcoin ETF filings were supposedly going to unlock a tsunami of new money into Bitcoin, pumping up the price of this crypto.\n\nAre these forecasts accurate?\n\nWhat's interesting is how two relatively small assumptions -- that Bitcoin will rival gold as a store of value, and that Bitcoin will represent a larger share of institutional asset allocations -- can lead to the monumental assumption that Bitcoin will soon be worth over $1 million.\n\nFrom my perspective, the assumption about the behavior of institutional investors is the most important. As Ark Invest noted in its February report, there has been an absolute sea change in the way that institutional investors think about crypto. Some big-time investors, including BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, are now very much aboard the crypto train. Their clients are demanding greater access to crypto, and they are now attempting to meet that need.\n\nWhat to look for next\n\nIn terms of what's next for Bitcoin, I'm keeping my eyes on how Bitcoin fares amid the economic uncertainty. I'm not quite ready to buy into the idea that Bitcoin is a \"safe\" investment, and certainly not after what we saw during the crypto winter of 2022, when Bitcoin lost nearly 65% of its value. But if there is another flare-up of the regional banking crisis, and investors behave the same way that they did earlier this year, I might be convinced.\n\nLong-term, I'm bullish on Bitcoin. It might not reach $1.48 million by 2030, as Cathie Wood and Ark Invest are predicting, but it's almost certainly going up over the next decade. If institutional adoption rates skyrocket, then Bitcoin could be off to the races."

        "content": "00:00\n\nSo you are in this race. Let's talk about the race a little bit. The first important deadline coming up is August 13th, where the AAC filing, the SCC is either going to delay it, which we think they'll probably delay it. And then BlackRock is later you filed before BlackRock but BlackRock came in with the surveillance sharing agreement with Coinbase that was novel. Right now we're looking in the future. There's talk of a common clock where the SCC could approve a bunch of ETFs at once, putting you on a level playing field with BlackRock and others. What's your take on how this will play out given you filed earlier? I think you're probably right that August 13th will come and go and I think I think the FCC, if it's going to approve a Bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once. So then again, because most of these essentially will be the same and it will come down to marketing and communicating the message. You know, we've been putting out our Bitcoin Monthly for the for the last year. We are now starting a Bitcoin brainstorming session. Our first one we launched last Thursday. So we're trying to get the word out there that, you know, our research is deep and we've been doing it since 2015 when we gained our first exposure to BTC. We were the first public asset manager to gain exposure to Bitcoin at all in 2015. That's exactly where I want to go. The grayscale Bitcoin trust known by its ticker gbtc. If you look at our W, for example, your ARK next generation Internet ETF. Right now I see GBTC as the third largest holding. If we are in a situation where the SEC does give its blessing for a spot Bitcoin ETF, would you plan to sell out of gbtc and buy one of these physically backed funds? I cannot talk about what we would and would not do. And in fact, our compliance team is, you know, giving us marching orders not to talk very much about this filing and its aftermath at all. So just the fact that we filed with our partner 21 shares is is as far as as I can go."

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nLatest Prices\n\nTop Stories\n\nA rebound in the price of bitcoin has sharply narrowed losses for MicroStrategy's (MSTR) holdings of the cryptocurrency. When Michael Saylor stepped down almost exactly a year ago as CEO of MicroStrategy to become its executive chairman with a sole focus on investing in bitcoin, his digital-asset strategy was looking pretty bleak. He had already spent billions of dollars of MicroStrategy\u2019s money to purchase bitcoin \u2014 and his paper loss amounted to about $1 billion. Today, though, MicroStrategy\u2019s position looks brighter as bitcoin\u2019s price has rebounded to above $29,000. Saylor has bought more. MicroStrategy now owns 152,800 bitcoins, up from 129,699 when he surrendered the CEO job. The new purchases have lowered MicroStrategy\u2019s cost basis to $29,672. Bottom line: MicroStrategy, a software company that has become a proxy for bitcoin's price because of its largest holdings of the cryptocurrency, is nearly back in the black with bitcoin.\n\nA spokesperson for Huobi is denying reports that several executives were arrested in China as outflow from the exchange picks up. Over the weekend, financial media in Hong Kong reported that several executives at Huobi had been taken away by police in China. According to data from Nansen.ai, Huobi\u2019s stablecoin exchange balances have dropped by 33% in the last week, with traders withdrawing $49 million. Earlier, Colin Wu of Wu Blockchain had posted that \u201ca large number of senior executives of offshore cryptocurrency exchanges \u2026 have been detained and investigated by the Chinese police\u201d without adding specifics.\n\nCurve Finance has recouped 73% of the funds stolen during a hack, which saw the platform lose over $73 million worth of various tokens. Over the past week, all $22 million in ether and ether derivatives stolen from Alchemix were returned. Curve, which lets users cheaply swap stablecoins on its platform, was hit by a reentrancy attack that allowed attackers to steal tokens from Curve, and lending and borrowing platforms Metronome and Alchemix.\n\nStory continues\n\nChart of the Day\n\nThe chart shows monthly changes in the turnover on Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange, by trading volume and open interest.\n\nAs the volatility meltdown continued, the cumulative turnover in crypto options, perpetual futures and standard futures segments declined by 27% to $37 billion in July.\n\nStill, the exchange accounted for 88% of the global crypto options activity.\n\n- Omkar Godbole\n\nTrending Posts"

        "content": "Bitcoin traded flat on Monday morning in Asia, staying just above the US$29,000 support level, while the token\u2019s volatility rating hit a record low. Ether also treaded water, as other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed with Solana leading the winners. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index edged lower and U.S. stock futures moved up following losses last week. Investors now await another busy week of corporate earnings reports and U.S. inflation data.\n\nBitcoin flat, volatility low\n\nBitcoin edged down 0.03% in the last 24 hours to US$29,039.48 as of 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong and down 0.78% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency briefly traded below the US$29,000 support level over the weekend.\n\nEther also dipped 0.48% to US$1,826, and moved down 1.89% over the past seven days.\n\n\u201cThe most fluctuation in Bitcoin over the last week and a half has been around US$29,200. And this is interesting because during this time, the dollar has gone into a growth mode, and there has been significant profit-taking in the equity market,\u201d wrote Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based online brokerage FxPro.\n\n\u201cThe market has been waiting for new signals, equally ready to return to growth or continue to fall,\u201d Kuptsikevich said. \u201cA drop below US$28,800 could quickly take the market to US$28,000 or even US$27,000. A rise above US$29,500 would open a quick path to US$30,000 and on to US$31,000.\u201d\n\nThe Bitcoin volatility index by crypto options trading platform Deribit, which indicates the expected volatility for Bitcoin over the next 30 days, hit an all-time-low of 34.02% on Monday. Meanwhile, crypto analytics firm K33 Research noted on Friday that Bitcoin\u2019s 5-day average volatility dropped lower than Gold, Nasdaq and S&P500 in the week ending July 30.\n\nBitcoin's volatility dropped lower than Gold, Nasdaq and S&P500 last week \ud83d\udcc9\n\n\n\nHistorically, such periods of low volatility have often been followed by surges in BTC volatility. Could this indicate an imminent price movement for bitcoin? pic.twitter.com/EvGYNd3tJI \u2014 K33 Research (@K33Research) August 4, 2023\n\n\u201cThis session is symptomatic of something we\u2019ve seen playing out over the past few months but is even more pronounced now: nothing,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen BTC make a 1%+ move from open to close in what feels like forever.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth checking with oneself for any hint of complacency; crypto markets typically don\u2019t reward inertia. Investors will find it very hard to position themselves, though, as positive news about crypto ETFs and engagement by institutions are balanced by regulatory woes and DeFi hacks,\u201d added d\u2019Anethan.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed as Solana led the winners. It gained 2.51% to US$23.18, but logged a weekly loss of 4.47%.\n\nDogecoin led the losers, falling 1.97% to US$0.07418, down 4.92% for the week.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.12% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion, while trading volume gained little, adding 1.42% to US$20.62 billion.\n\nMore doom and gloom for NFT developers\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.28% in the past 24 hours to 2,459.91 as of 10:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 3.34% for the week. However, Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon NFT market indexes all logged losses, with only the Cardano index moving higher.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume fell 12.78% in the past 24 hours to US$14.78 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nBy NFT collections, Mythos Chain-based game NFT marketplace DMarket posted the largest 24-hour trading volume. Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained Cards made up the second and third place spots.\n\nWreck League, an NFT-based fighting game backed by Web3 venture capital and game development firm Animoca Brands, announced a licensing agreement with BAYC developer Yuga Labs on Thursday.\n\n\ud83d\udcfaTake a closer look at our first collaboration with @yugalabs and discover the exclusive advantages of being part of the next generation of fighting games!\n\n\n\n\u25b6\ufe0fPowered by @apecoin \ud83e\uddbe pic.twitter.com/pvxAQHLTTf \u2014 Wreck League \u27a1\ufe0fALLOWLIST OPEN! (@WreckLeagueHQ) August 4, 2023\n\nThat agreement will see Yuga Labs\u2019 NFT collections incorporated into the game. The game will be launched in September.\n\nAccording to a Sunday report by the Bored Ape Gazette, a news site funded by the ApeCoin DAO, Wreck League\u2019s in-game NFTs will be minted exclusively with ApeCoin. ApeCoin is the governance and utility token used in the Yuga Labs ecosystem.\n\nFollowing the news, ApeCoin\u2019s price rose to a weekly high of US$2.04 on Sunday, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nElsewhere, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning Saturday about NFT phishing scams. The FBI claims that fraudsters, posing as NFT developers, are using fake social media accounts to trick users into linking their digital wallets to smart contracts that extract their digital funds.\n\nAnd the bad news for developers isn\u2019t over.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report published Saturday, total NFT royalties received by creators plunged from US$269 million in January 2022 to only US4.3 million in July 2023.\n\nA significant decline in NFT trades coupled with competition between NFT marketplaces OpenSea and Blur has drastically driven down royalty rates. The total NFT trading volume fell more than 90% over the same period, according to data from CryptoSlam.\n\nU.S. labor market cools\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 12:10 p.m. on Monday in Hong Kong. The three major U.S. stock indexes closed lower in regular trading last Friday and ended the week with losses.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes moved down on Monday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged losses.\n\nThe U.S. economy added 187,000 payrolls in July, lower than analyst expectations. Hourly average wages also logged a higher-than-expected increase of 4.4%, Bloomberg reported Friday.\n\nThat data points to a cooling U.S. labor market. However, wage inflation is still double the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s target level.\n\n\u2018Today\u2019s numbers will do little to change the narrative of the Fed. The earnings numbers in particular will be of concern to the \u2018hawks\u2019 on the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) and will do nothing to dissuade them from arguing for another interest rate hike at September\u2019s meeting,\u201d Stuart Cole, Equiti Capital\u2019s head macro economist told Reuters.\n\nInvestors now await the U.S. July consumer price index (CPI) on Thursday and producer price index (PPI) on Friday. Both reports will provide insight into U.S. inflation and the direction of the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\nThe Fed meets on September 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 86.5% chance for no interest rate hike in September, and a 13.5% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike, down from 17.5% on Friday.\n\nThis week will also be busy with second-quarter earning reports from major corporations including Walt Disney, Alibaba Group Holdings and Honda Motor.\n\nElsewhere, China\u2019s imports and exports data is expected Tuesday, as well as the country\u2019s CPI and PPI on Wednesday. Analysts expect the Chinese CPI and PPI to pose annual decreases in July.\n\n(Updates to add equities section.)"

        "content": "To the extent that Fed tightening helped bring along bitcoin's price crash, the slowing and perhaps end of that tightening has been seen as a factor in bitcoin's modest recovery. While low number from Thursday's CPI might reinforce that idea, short-term interest rate traders have already priced in no more rate hikes from the Fed this year. Estimates for next year from CME Group show traders are anticipating rate cuts from the U.S. central bank, perhaps as soon as February."

        "content": "Bitcoin edged up on Tuesday morning in Asia after U.S. multinational payment giant PayPal launched a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin on Monday. Ether was still treading water, however, as all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to lower. Dogecoin led the losers. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index rose, as NFT trading volume also picked up. U.S. stock futures traded flat after Wall Street closed higher on Monday, as investors await the release of U.S. inflation data Thursday.\n\nPivotal role for PayPal stablecoin?\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.28% in the last 24 hours to US$29,133.55 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong but remained down 0.25% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency briefly dropped to a low of US$28,724.14 on early Tuesday morning.\n\nDigital asset investment products saw outflows totaling US$107 million in the week ending August 4, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. That marked the fourth consecutive week of outflows as profit taking gathered pace in recent weeks.\n\nBitcoin-related products saw weekly outflows totaling US$111 million, the largest for a week since March. However, outflows into Bitcoin short positions stopped for the first time in the past 14 weeks, according to the CoinShares report. Allowing investors to profit when the token\u2019s price drops, the report\u2019s authors said that the stall in short position outflows suggests institutional investors may be adjusting their Bitcoin strategies.\n\nEther dipped 0.13% to US$1,824.53, and lost 1.72% over the past seven days.\n\nPaypal ramped up its efforts in the Web3 space by launching the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin on Monday. The Ethereum-based token is issued by Paxos Trust Company \u2014 the U.S.-based issuer of Binance\u2019s BUSD stablecoin \u2014 and is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. treasuries and similar cash equivalents.\n\nPaypal\u2019s stablecoin project was reportedly halted in February 2023 amid increased scrutiny from U.S. regulators toward stablecoins \u2014 including an order for Paxos to stop minting BUSD.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, we\u2019re unveiling a new stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD). It\u2019s designed for payments and is backed by highly liquid and secure assets. Starting today and rolling out in the next few weeks, you\u2019ll be able to buy, sell, hold and transfer PYUSD.

The meme token dropped 1.65% to US$0.07325 and logged a weekly loss of 5.86%.\n\nThe month of July saw a decrease in crypto trading activities, with Bitcoin volume decreasing 13.1% during the month, Ether falling by 21.9% and stablecoins volumes down 12.3%.\n\n\u201cThe data emphasizes a moment of low activity in the market, which follows a strong uptrend in the first half of 2023,\u201d said Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset and fintech investment firm Fineqia International.\n\n\u201cSummer months are notoriously among the ones with the lowest level of trading activity and 2023 data are perfectly aligned with historical metrics on the matter. The overall outlook for 2023 remains extremely positive so far as the institutional / service providers\u2019 news seen in the past few weeks still indicates strong interest towards the market,\u201d Greco added.\n\nFor Greco, signs of that interest include multiple applications in the U.S. for exchange-traded funds (ETF) for Bitcoin and Ether. He also pointed to Hong Kong, where regulators have granted crypto exchanges HashKey Exchange and OKX licenses to offer crypto trading services to retail investors.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.11% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion, while trading volume gained 59.07% to US$32.76 billion.\n\nTremors of NFT excitement following PayPal news\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index gained 0.62% in the past 24 hours to 2,478.88 as of 10:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. However, it was still down 1.36% lower for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana, Polygon and Cardano indexes logged losses.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 15.80% in the past 24 hours to US$13.09 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. The volumes on Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Bitcoin and Cardano blockchains all logged increases.\n\n\u201cPaypal announcing the launch of a stablecoin has excited the NFT market a bit, as they look forward to an easy way to onboard the masses to crypto,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.\n\nHowever, NFT trading activity remains downbeat compared to the meteoric highs of late 2021 and 2022. Total NFT trading volume last week totaled US$87.76 million, over 60% lower than the start of the year, according to CryptoSlam.\n\n\u201cNow, sales volume is clearly lower. (But) It\u2019s not the only measurement of growth,\u201d said Petscher in a Youtube video posted Monday. Unique buyers, unique sellers and total transactions have all grown considerably since this time two years ago, he added.\n\n\u201cBut the ecosystem has matured. The NFTs are getting cheaper. The supply is getting greater. It\u2019s a different space. And it\u2019s exactly what we need to reach the masses,\u201d Petscher said.\n\nIn terms of NFT collections, Mythos Chain-based NFT marketplace DMarket posted the largest 24-hour trading volume but still dipped 4.48% to US$931,685. ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained Cards and Ethereum-based Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) ranked second and third.\n\nGrails IV, the latest NFT collection issued by NFT startup Proof, started minting on Monday. The collection features artwork from 20 artists whose identities will be revealed when minting is completed Friday.\n\nThe Grails minting window has opened.\n\n\n\nIn less than an hour, more than 450 pieces have been minted. Grails #3, 4, 5, 18, and 19 are sold out!\n\n\n\nWhich did you choose? https://t.co/PquuNwVUOl \u2014 PROOF (\ud83e\udd43,\ud83e\udd89) (@proof_xyz) August 7, 2023\n\n\u201cProof\u2019s Grails IV collection has started minting, so expect some movement with art in general as collectors welcome some new future grails to their wallets. Artists will reveal soon which should add some excitement to the space,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nChina export woes and more US rate hikes ahead?\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 11:50 a.m. on Tuesday in Hong Kong after the three major U.S. stock indexes closed higher in regular trading on Monday.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes were mixed on Tuesday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and South Korea\u2019s Kospi remained flat, Japan\u2019s Nikkei logged gains, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropped.\n\nAmid the U.S. second-quarter reporting season, 79% of S&P 500 companies have released earnings higher than analyst expectations. That is the highest beat rate since the third quarter of 2021, Reuters reported on Monday citing data from Refinitiv.\n\nInvestors now await U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data on Thursday. Analysts expect core CPI to rise 0.2% in July, which would be the smallest monthly increase in the past two and a half years.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said on Monday that multiple interest rate hikes may still be needed to curb inflation.\n\n\u201cWe have made progress in lowering inflation over the past year, but inflation is still significantly above the FOMC\u2019s two percent target, and the labor market continues to be tight, with job openings still far exceeding the number of available workers,\u201d said Bowman in a Monday speech.\n\n\u201cGiven these developments, I supported raising the federal funds rate at our July meeting, and I expect that additional increases will likely be needed to lower inflation to the FOMC\u2019s goal,\u201d said Bowman.\n\nThe Fed meets on September 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level in the past 22 years. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 86.5% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September, and a 13.5% chance the Fed will raise rates by a further 25-basis-points.\n\nElsewhere, China\u2019s exports in July slid 14.5% year-on-year to US$201.16 billion. Imports also posted an annual decrease of 12.4%, Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency reported on Tuesday.\n\nAs the country attempts to support its economic recovery by stimulating domestic demand, the drop in July exports was the biggest decline since February 2020. The figure fell well below analyst expectations.\n\n\u201cThe government policy so far has changed but more on the property sector, and not much on boosting demand,\u201d Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management Ltd, told Bloomberg. \u201cSo the economic situation is still quite challenging.\u201d\n\n(Updates to add equities section.)"

        "content": "Blockstream CEO Adam Back, one of the crypto\u2019s early pioneers, is pretty confident Bitcoin will hit an all-time high of over $100,000 before Bitcoin's halving in 2024 \u2014 and is willing to drop a million wagering on it.\n\nIn an Aug. 7 conversation on X (formerly known as Twitter), Back agreed to a bet with pseudonymous X user @Vikingobbitcoin that Bitcoin would reach $100,000 by March 31, 2024. Vinkingo said they believe it won\u2019t happen until 2025.\n\nThe origins of the wager. Source: X\n\nThe wagered date comes in roughly a month before the halving \u2014 which is currently on track for April 26 \u2014 as Back believes that the price will \u201cprobably\u201d reach a new all-time high sooner than the actual date of the halving.\n\nBets on dramatic increases in the price of Bitcoin have attracted huge sums in the past, such as Balaji Srinivasan\u2019s $1 million 90-day Bitcoin bet in March.\n\nBeck\u2019s also been bullish about Bitcoin in the past, saying in February that Bitcoin could reach $10 million by the sixth halving in 2032.\n\nThis time, Back is actually setting down hard-earned funds to back his most recent claim. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a million satoshis, not U.S. dollars. That\u2019s only $290 in current prices (or over $1,000 if Back\u2019s prediction comes true).\n\nAdam Back accepts 1 million satoshi wager. Source: Twitter\n\nA satoshi \u2014 \u201csat\u201d for short \u2014 is the smallest divisible unit of Bitcoin, and there are 100 million sats to a single BTC.\n\nThus, it\u2019s a rather small bet for Back, given his net worth is estimated to be somewhere between $50 and $300 million.\n\nRelated: How will Bitcoin halving affect BTC price, and is DeFi dead?\n\nHowever, in a response to Back\u2019s original post, Jan3 CEO and fellow Bitcoiner Samson Mow said that he too expects a new all-time high for Bitcoin \u201cpre halving, not post.\u201d\n\nI also think new ATH pre-halving, not post. \u2014 Samson Mow (@Excellion) August 5, 2023\n\nDespite the small bet, it has attracted some snide replies in the responses \u2014 but still reflects a growing bullish trend on the price of Bitcoin among market commentators and analysts ahead of next year\u2019s halving.\n\nMeanwhile, in a Feb. 24 interview with Cointelegraph, Charles Edwards, the founder of Capriole Investments, said that the upcoming halving will see Bitcoin become the \u201chardest asset in the world\u201d and predicted that the market is already in the early stages of a new bull cycle.\n\nMagazine: Deposit risk: What do crypto exchanges really do with your money?"

        "title": "China's risky Bitcoin court decision, is Huobi in trouble or not? Asia Express - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Our weekly roundup of news from East Asia curates the industry\u2019s most important developments.\n\nChinese man\u2019s $10M loss as court says Bitcoin lending not protected by law\n\nA man in China\u2019s Jiangsu province, identified as Mr. Xu, appears to be out of luck after a court ruled that his 341 Bitcoin loan ($9.9 million) to counterparty Mr. Lin is not protected by law according to local news reports on August 3.\n\nSome time ago, Mr. Xu lent 341 Bitcoins to Mr. Lin after the latter approached him for a peer-to-peer loan. At the time, Mr. Xu lacked fiat funds, and so the parties settled on using Bitcoin for the borrowing through a written agreement. Shortly afterward, however, Mr. Lin defaulted on the loan, prompting Mr. Xu to sue in the Changzhou Zhonglou People\u2019s Court. The case was dismissed.\n\nChinese magistrate Ming Wang explains why the Bitcoin lending contract was invalid and therefore denied relief for breach of contract. (Screenshot)\n\nIn supporting the judgment, Ming Wang, vice-magistrate of the Changzhou Zhonglou People\u2019s Court, told reporters that Bitcoin is a digital commodity that does not hold the same legal status as fiat currencies. Therefore, the asset can neither be subject to a legal enforcement action, enter circulation, or be used to \u201d award compensation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lender bears ALL risks [when lending crypto],\u201d Wang warned. That said, in another ruling dated Nov. 29, the Hangzhou Internet Court wrote that digital assets such as nonfungible tokens are \u201conline virtual property\u201d that should be protected under Chinese law.\n\nAside from outright ownership, all forms of cryptocurrencies and transactions are currently illegal in China. The country has been cracking down on private blockchain initiatives in favor of the Central Government\u2019s efforts to promote centralized blockchain, such as via the digital yuan CBDC.\n\nChina\u2019s disappearing Web3 founders\n\nJust last month, Chinese cross-chain bridge Multichain was still one of the biggest in the DeFi sector. While its reputation took a hit due to the disappearance of its co-founder, Zhaojun He, the protocol still had around $1.5 billion in total value locked at the start of July.\n\nThen on July 14, investors\u2019 worst fears came true after Multichain developers revealed that Zhaojun had been arrested by Chinese police nearly two months prior. Because Zhaojun held discretionary control of Multichain\u2019s entire server-based and private keys, they said the protocol had to be shut down.\n\n\n\nBut the question left many readers pondering, how does the arrest of a single individual lead to the shutdown of an entire enterprise and the disappearance of enterprise funds? One anonymous user in the Multichain Telegram chat claimed:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a total supply chain. Third-party tracking companies will supply leads to the police to take them into custody as long as the [Web3] co-founder is in China and has money. Where do you think the police\u2019s case came from? Third-party tracking companies make at up to 10 figures [CNY] from such tipoffs.\u201d\n\nWhile Zhaojun is currently detained without any revelation of the charges \u2014 or any news whatsoever \u2014 the Multichain funds supposedly \u201cstuck\u201d in the protocol are on the move. Blockchain security firms, such as Bitrace and PeckShield, have revealed that since Zhaojun\u2019s arrest, assets stored on the Multichain bridge had been swapped for stablecoins and transferred out of the protocol. The move prompted stablecoin issuers such as Circle and Tether to freeze over $63 million of suspicious transactions linked to Multichain.\n\nA man alleged to be Multichain co-founder and CEO Zhao Jun (Telegram)\n\nIn a series of screenshots seen by Cointelegraph, exchanges such as Binance are also investigating stablecoin deposits to its platform linked to the Multichain incident. Meanwhile, whoever is making the transfers has appeared to smarten up as well, with swaps of users\u2019 assets now being done through privacy coins as opposed to traceable assets.\n\nSome observers theorize that the circumstantial evidence points to the Chinese police moving the coins. For starters, the In a similar incident, Wuwei Liang, brother of CoinXP co-founder Liang Liang, wrote in regard to the ongoing criminal proceedings against his brother and the firm:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe virtual currency involved in the case [seized from CoinXP by police] was transferred to other wallet addresses by the Wuxi Public Security Bureau, and 20 Bitcoins disappeared during the transfer process and have not been recovered so far.\u201d\n\nLiang Liang\u2019s trial is ongoing and the blockchain executive is currently charged with \u201cillegal solicitation of public funds\u201d and running a \u201cmulti-level marketing\u201d scheme. The latter, by the way, carries the penalty of civil forfeiture of all personal and enterprise assets if convicted, and the trial is not going well.\n\nThe crackdown appears to have started with China\u2019s own state-blockchain centralization efforts this year. On May 31, Cointelegraph reported that offices of the Chinese offshore-yuan stablecoin issuer CNHC had been raided by police. Its executive had been reportedly detained and like Multichain, no news has been heard from them since.\n\nHuobi in trouble once again Everything is just fine\n\nIf I could sum up with everything that goes on in blockchain from day to day using one phrase, it\u2019d be \u201call is not, as it seems.\u201d\n\nOn August 6, local news outlets in Hong Kong reported that senior executives of cryptocurrency exchange Huobi had been arrested by Chinese police. The exchange subsequently denied this as \u201cfake news.\u201d Chinese blockchain personality Justin Sun, the de-facto owner of the exchange, also labeled the news as fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD).\n\nBut as Adam Cochran, partner of Cinneamhain Ventures, claimed on Twitter that Sun allegedly withdrew $60 million from the exchange after the news broke out. Cochran also claimed that some Huobi staff \u201care currently under criminal investigation,\u201d citing an insider at Tron (Sun\u2019s blockchain project) who has \u201cfirst hand knowledge of the investigation.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to Sun, Huobi is doing just fine. On August 1, Sun claimed that the exchange generated more than $85 million in profits in Q2 2023, with $100 million in profits projected for Q3 2023. Pretty impressive, considering that the exchange suffered an internal revolt just earlier this year after the firm allegedly slashed a vast majority of employment benefits.\n\nBut anyway swirling rumors around Huobi may be behind its USDT reserves declining to less than $100 million from $630 million last month, while its total assets have fallen to $2.5 billion compared to $3.1 billion in the same period.\n\nHuobi\u2019s total assets vs. inflows (DeFiLlama)"

        "content": "Key Takeaways\n\nBitcoin\u2019s halving influences market sentiment and the profitability of miners, among other things\n\nAdam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, bets big that Bitcoin will reach a record high of over $100,000\n\nPrevious Bitcoin price halvings have been long-term bullish factors for the crypto\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is a significant event that impacts market mood, miner profitability, and innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. According to Adam Back, it should also grow the currency price. The crypto community is already weighing in with various predictions on Bitcoin\u2019s potential price with less than a year to go.\n\nBitcoin To Exceed $100,000 Before Its 2024 Halving?\n\nOne of the early cryptocurrency pioneers, Blockstream\u2019s CEO Adam Back, is certain that Bitcoin will reach an all-time high of over $100,000 before it is halved in April 2024 and is willing to stake 1 million Satoshis on it (a hundredth of a Bitcoin, or around $290 at current prices)\n\nIn a chat on X (formerly known as Twitter) on August 7, Back and anonymous X user @Vikingobbitcoin settled on a wager that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 by March 31, 2024. According to Vinkingo , it probably won\u2019t occur until 2025.\n\nCCN reached out to Adam Back for commentary but did not receive a reply at the time of publishing\n\nBack predicts that the price will \u201cprobably\u201d achieve a new all-time high before the halves, which is scheduled for April 26. This puts the wagered date close to a month before the splitting.\n\nHuge sums have previously been wagered on sharp increases in the price of Bitcoin, such as Balaji Srinivasan \u2018s $1 million 90-day Bitcoin wager in March.\n\nBack Investing His Own Money \u2013 Community Laughs\n\nAdditionally, Back has previously expressed optimism about Bitcoin, stating in February that it might hit $10 million by the sixth halving in 2032. He then mentioned that the flagship crypto asset could explode to a $200 trillion market cap in the next nine years.\n\nearly this year i was curious of the claim \"bitcoin 2x's per year on average\". it checks: the decade jan 2013 \u2013 dec 2022 #bitcoin went up 2.036x/year (1200x in a decade). if that continues we'll cross $10mil/BTC and $200 tril market cap by end of next 2 halvenings, about 9 years. pic.twitter.com/mqmO2SRdAv \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) February 12, 2023\n\nThis time, Back is investing his own money to support his most recent assertion.\n\nUnfortunately, instead of dollars, it\u2019s a million satoshis currently, but, if Back\u2019s forecast comes true \u2014 he will receive more than $1,000.\n\nThe smallest division of a Bitcoin is called a satoshi, or \u201csat\u201d for short. There are 100 million sats in a single BTC.\n\nGiven that Back\u2019s net worth is thought to be somewhere between $50 and $300 million , it is therefore a relatively minor wager for him.\n\nSamson Mow, the CEO of Jan3 and a fellow Bitcoiner, responded to Back\u2019s original article by stating that he too anticipates a new all-time high for Bitcoin, but \u201cpre-halving, not post.\u201d\n\nthe bet is on\ud83d\ude80: i bet #bitcoin reaches or exceeds $100k between now and halving (31st Mar 2024) with @vikingobitcoin9 1million sats to the winner. https://t.co/Ij7iPEYjQW pic.twitter.com/PNpAaZvl8F \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) August 5, 2023\n\nBack\u2019s little wager has received some sarcastic comments ; nonetheless, it still indicates an increasing bullish tendency among market pundits and analysts on the price of Bitcoin ahead of next year\u2019s halving.\n\nadam please let me know if you need help financing that $300 bet \u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) August 5, 2023\n\nWho is Back, and Why Care About his Predictions?\n\nLike David Chaum and Hal Finney, Adam Back is a \u201cBritish cryptographer and cypherpunk\u201d from London who was \u201ca pioneer of early digital asset research.\u201d\n\nHe created the cryptographic hash-based proof-of-work technique Hashcash in 1997. When mining, Bitcoin uses the hashcash proof-of-work function as the mining core, and Bitcoin miners are expending their effort creating hashcash proof-of-work, which acts as a vote in the blockchain evolution and validate the blockchain transaction log.\n\nWhen giving his predictions, Back usually talks about the macro factors that he believes will make his price prediction come true. In short, he seems to think that the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the U.S., is responsible for all the factors that define Bitcoin price. Such a macroeconomic view differentiates him from the crypto experts, who usually focus only on crypto and not the whole ecosystem per se.\n\neveryone has their pet macro-views. my guess: stock market + US election season, moral hazard kicks up, QE ramps up again, rates drop again, money printer goes into over-drive. so the interest rate overhang falls off. and BTC decorrelates somewhere along the way once defi flushed \u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) June 16, 2022\n\nAlso, it\u2019s good to know that Back primarily used two methods to amass his wealth. First, by purchasing Bitcoin in 2011, when one cost between $0.70 and $15. Even a modest purchase made at the time for $10,000 would be worth more than $30 million now.\n\nAdam Back did a fantastic job of capitalizing on his early interest in and exposure to the cypherpunk movement by investing very early in Bitcoin and creating a billion-dollar business in the same industry. He has been fortunate enough to amass a sizeable net worth from his endeavors, maybe between $100 and $300 million.\n\nWhy People Predict Around the Halving?\n\nFollowing a halving, there is typically an uptick in volatility for Bitcoin. With less Bitcoin in circulation, its value rises, and investors find it more desirable.\n\nWhen examining the post-halving booms in Bitcoin, other factors should be taken into account:\n\nmore press coverage on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\n\na curiosity about the privacy of the digital asset\n\na steady rise in the number of real-world applications for the money\n\nIf you trust in the importance of history, previous Bitcoin price halvings have been long-term bullish factors for the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, the subsequent halving will almost certainly have various effects on the BTC ecosystem. The number of Bitcoin miners is generally expected to fall as the financial incentive to mine diminishes and, for less skilled miners, becomes unprofitable."

        "content": "Bitcoin price has cautiously ratcheted upward since Jan. A rising trend channel from $16,600 to $30,000 almost doubled the spot price of BTC in H1.\n\nThe price changed in three phases, with blistering rallies that happened in January, March, and June.\n\nHere\u2019s what large language model chatbot Google Bard has to say about the best day of the week to buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple.\n\nCheapest Day of the Week to Buy Crypto?\n\nThere\u2019s no telling for sure if markets will cool down for now or soar higher in the short term.\n\nInvestors looking to accumulate crypto in regular small increments for the long term, however, might consider making Saturdays their go-to weekday for stacking sats.\n\nBuying a set amount of crypto or stocks on a weekly schedule is a classic investing strategy called dollar cost averaging.\n\nGoogle Bard says Saturdays are the second-best day of the week to buy crypto. But if you\u2019re looking for the cheapest prices, the best day of all to buy crypto, according to Bard, is Sunday.\n\nHere was Google Bard\u2019s entire answer\n\nQuestion: \u201cBard, what is the best day of the week to buy cryptocurrency?\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to historical market data, the best day of the week to buy cryptocurrency is Sunday. The second best day is Saturday. After that, prices rise with Friday being the most expensive day to buy cryptocurrency. Here are some of the reasons why Sunday is considered the best day to buy cryptocurrency: Trading volumes are typically lower on weekends, which can lead to lower prices.\n\nThere is less news and volatility on weekends, which can also lead to lower prices.\n\nSome investors may be taking profits on Friday, which can drive prices down on Saturday and Sunday. Of course, there is no guarantee that the price of cryptocurrency will be lower on Sunday. The market is volatile and prices can go up or down at any time. However, if you are looking to buy cryptocurrency at a relatively low price, Sunday is a good day to start your search.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what the numbers say to back up Bard\u2019s answer:\n\nPsst: Bitcoin price goes on sale 1% Sundays\n\nBitcoin price averaged lower from Saturdays through Mondays over the last year of trading. An analysis of the historical daily price data suggests Fridays through Mondays are the best days to buy crypto.\n\nTuesdays and Wednesdays are the best days to sell, the data suggest.\n\nThe lowest average daily high price for any day of the week for Bitcoin from Aug 5, 2022 \u2013 Aug 3, 2023, was on Sundays. Over this time period, BTC\u2019s average intraday high price on Sundays was $23,595. On Saturdays, it was $23,480. The highest average was on Wednesdays: $23,850.\n\nIf an investor reaped the entire benefit of these figures, it would mean buying their BTC 1% cheaper each week.\n\nNot bad, Bard."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) continued its boring price action over the weekend, indicating that the bulls and the bears are not waging large bets as they are uncertain about the next directional move. Nevertheless, traders should continue to keep a close watch because a period of consolidation is usually followed by an increase in volatility.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty, some analysts point to the Bitcoin whales increasing their exposure as a positive sign. On-chain analyst Cole Garner believes the bull move could begin in September when the summer seasonality kicks in and the shakeout happens.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nBitcoin rose sharply in the first few months of the year but the major altcoins struggled to keep pace. That could change as the current consolidation in the largest cryptocurrency is giving an opportunity for select altcoins to play catch up.\n\nWhat are the top five cryptocurrencies that are looking positive in the near term? Let\u2019s study their charts to determine the resistance levels to keep an eye on.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on Aug. 5, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. The price is getting squeezed between the 20-day exponential moving average ($29,430) and the horizontal support at $28,861.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe downsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory indicate that bears are at a slight advantage. Sellers will try to yank the price below the $28,861-to-$28,585 support zone. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could start a downward move to $26,000.\n\nConversely, if the price rebounds off the current level and breaks above the 50-day simple moving average ($29,840), it will suggest the start of a recovery to the overhead resistance zone between $31,804 and $32,400.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls have been defending the support at $28,861, but a negative sign is that they haven\u2019t been able to achieve a strong rebound off it. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.\n\nThe 20-EMA is turning down gradually and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting that the bears have a minor advantage. The sellers will have to sink and sustain the price below $28,861 to resume the short-term down move.\n\nIf bulls want to start a recovery, they will have to drive and sustain the price above the moving averages. If they do that, the pair could climb to the stiff overhead resistance at $30,000. A break and close above this level could open the doors for a further rally to $31,000.\n\nShiba Inu price analysis\n\nShiba Inu (SHIB) broke and closed above the overhead resistance of $0.0000085 on Aug. 4, indicating that the bulls are trying to start a new uptrend.\n\nSHIB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bullish momentum picked up further on Aug. 5 and the SHIB/USDT pair soared to $0.000010. This move sent the RSI into the overbought territory, indicating that a minor correction or consolidation is possible.\n\nIf the bulls do not give up much ground from the current levels, it will signal that traders are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher. If the price breaks above $0.000010, the pair may surge to $0.000012 and then to $0.000014.\n\nSHIB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls are trying to arrest the decline at the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off the current level with strength, the bulls will again try to push the price to $0.000010. A break above this level could signal the resumption of the up-move.\n\nInstead, if the price continues lower and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that traders are aggressively booking profits. A break below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.000009 could open the doors for a potential fall to $0.0000085.\n\nUniswap price analysis\n\nUniswap (UNI) has been in a correction for the past few days but a positive sign is that the bulls are trying to arrest the decline near the 20-day EMA ($6.04).\n\nUNI/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf the price rebounds off the current level with strength, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and the traders are using the dips to buy. The UNI/USDT pair could first rise to $6.70 and if this level is crossed, the next target could be $7.50.\n\nAnother possibility is that the price sustains below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, it will suggest that the up-move has ended. The pair could then descend to the 50-day SMA ($5.58) where buying may emerge.\n\nThe flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nUNI/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-EMA has turned down, and the RSI is in negative territory, indicating that the bears have the upper hand. If the price continues lower and breaks below $5.93, the correction may resume. The next support on the downside is $5.66.\n\nContrarily, if bulls propel the price above the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the bears are losing their grip. The pair may first rise to the 50-SMA and if this level is taken out, the up-move may reach $6.70.\n\nRelated: XRP price disappoints after court ruling, Deaton remains optimistic\n\nOKB price analysis\n\nOKB (OKB) has been gradually falling inside a large range between $38 and $59 for the past several weeks. The bulls pushed the price above the downtrend line on Aug. 4, indicating that the short-term downtrend may be ending.\n\nOKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($43) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the bulls have the upper hand. Buyers will try to propel the price to $48 and subsequently to $50. This level may act as a major hurdle but if crossed, the pair could quickly jump up to $54.\n\nContrary to this assumption, a slide below the downtrend line will indicate that the attempt to start an up-move fizzled out. The bears will gain further strength if they sink the OKB/USDT pair below the moving averages. The pair could then slump to $41.\n\nOKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears tried to tug the price back below the downtrend line, but the bulls successfully held the level. This suggests that the buyers have flipped the downtrend line into support. The pair could first rise to $46, and if this obstacle is overcome, the next target could be $48.\n\nThe 20-EMA is an important support to watch out for. If the price plunges below the 20-EMA and the downtrend line, it will suggest that bears are back in command. The pair may then tumble to $42.\n\nHedera price analysis\n\nHedera (HBAR) broke above the overhead resistance of $0.055 on Aug. 6, indicating that bulls are attempting a comeback.\n\nHBAR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf buyers sustain the price above $0.055, it will signal the start of a new up-move. There is a minor resistance at $0.062 but if this level is crossed, the HBAR/USDT pair could pick up momentum. The pair could first rise to $0.065 and thereafter attempt a rally to $0.075.\n\nThe important level to watch on the downside is $0.055. If bulls flip this level into support, it will indicate a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the 50-day SMA ($0.05). That could sink the pair to $0.045.\n\nHBAR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls pushed the price above the overhead resistance of $0.055. This completed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which has a target objective of $0.07.\n\nThe sharp rally has pushed the RSI into deeply overbought territory, indicating that a minor correction or consolidation is possible. On the downside, $0.055 is the critical level to keep an eye on.\n\nIf bears want to prevent this up-move, they will have to yank the price below the breakout level of $0.05. The pair could then plunge to $0.045.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "content": "PayPal PYPL announced on Monday morning that it would be introducing its own US dollar pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD). Could this be a catalyst to ignite the next rally in Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto industry?\n\nFrom PayPal\u2019s Newsroom Release:\n\nPayPal USD is designed to contribute to the opportunity stablecoins offer for payments and is 100% backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S Treasuries and similar cash equivalents. PayPal USD is redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars and is issued by Paxos Trust Company.\n\nStarting today and rolling out in the coming weeks, eligible U.S. PayPal customers who purchase PayPal USD will be able to:\n\nTransfer PayPal USD between PayPal and compatible external wallets\n\nSend person-to-person payments using PYUSD\n\nFund purchases with PayPal USD by selecting it at checkout\n\nConvert any of PayPal's supported cryptocurrencies to and from PayPal USD\n\n\n\nImage Source: PayPal Newsroom\n\nPayPal Crypto Efforts\n\nThis is a continuation of PayPal\u2019s current strategy of entering the crypto markets. In late 2020 PYPL began offering customers the ability to buy a handful of the largest crypto currencies through its platform so offering a stablecoin is a logical next step in building out the ecosystem.\n\nCreating a stablecoin in the current economic environment is also one of the least risky, and most profitable ways to expand its crypto products. Stablecoins stand out as a highly profitable vertical within the cryptocurrency realm, particularly in a context of higher interest rates. This is especially true considering that stablecoin reserve portfolios typically comprise Treasuries, which have the potential to generate returns exceeding 5%.\n\nWhat is a Stablecoin?\n\nA stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a tangible asset like a fiat currency (e.g., US Dollar, Euro) or a commodity (e.g., gold). Unlike other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can experience significant price volatility, stablecoins aim to provide a more consistent and reliable value. They are often used in digital transactions, trading, and as a store of value due to their relatively steady price characteristics.\n\nPayPal Trading at a Discount\n\nReflecting a mixed earnings revisions trend, PayPal currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. However, the stock is trading near its all-time low valuation. Today, PYPL is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 16.2x, which is below the industry average of 47x, and well below its 10-year median of 43.2x.\n\nWhile P/E ratios are hardly a market timing tool, it is certainly worth noting just how cheaply PayPal is trading from a historical perspective.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOther Players\n\nBitcoin and other crypto adjacent stocks have enjoyed strong YTD returns, even with the SEC cracking down on some of the biggest players.\n\nCoinbase COIN , the publicly trade cryptocurrency brokerage was recently sued by the SEC. The SEC alleges that Coinbase has been running an unregistered broker and clearing house, putting into question the entire business model. Yet COIN stock has rallied 140% YTD, nonetheless.\n\nWhile Coinbase may still appear too risky an investment considering its current legal troubles, and PayPal has a subpar Zacks Rank, there is one stock investors may want to consider.\n\nBlock SQ , Jack Dorsey\u2019s fintech company is a top ranked stock with exposure Bitcoin. Block has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions and is expected to roll out a new crypto product this year.\n\nBlock is planning to release Bitkey, a hardware-based crypto key that will function as a self-custody wallet. Jack Dorsey is a well-known proponent of Bitcoin and regularly speaks on his support of blockchain technology and Bitcoin as an important economic tool.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBullish Setup in Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin, along with the crypto stocks and broader market has been on a strong run this year already up 72% YTD.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, if Bitcoin can breakout above the $29,600 level it may begin the next bull leg higher. Alternatively, if it can\u2019t hold the $28,500 level, Bitcoin traders should be cautious as the technical setup will be invalidated.\n\n\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nInvestors looking to get exposure to Bitcoin without directly buying the crypto may want to consider BITO by ProShares. BITO is a Bitcoin linked ETF that is constructed using Bitcoin futures rather than spot Bitcoin. BITO is currently the best option for access through the equity market.\n\nBottom Line\n\nPayPal expanding its offerings is another positive step in the right direction for the cryptocurrency industry. As one of the original digital payment innovators, PayPal makes for a sensible medium for those looking to enter crypto.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t know for certain how Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market will respond to this news, I consider it quite bullish, and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it acted as a catalyst for a rally.\n\nZacks Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nIt\u2019s credited with a \u201cwatershed medical breakthrough\u201d and is developing a bustling pipeline of other projects that could make a world of difference for patients suffering from diseases involving the liver, lungs, and blood.

The public will follow suit, and gone will be the days when fiat is used to purchase all manner of goods and services, as well as for leisure purposes such as playing on online casinos.\n\nThe Bear Fiat Currency Bitcoin Case\n\nWhile it is certainly possible that these insane levels of debt may eventually crater individual sovereign nations, along with their currencies, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be of no value in those circumstances.\n\nThat\u2019s because, at the moment that the local currency is considered worthless, no bitcoin seller will sell his bitcoin in exchange for a worthless currency.\n\nBears will now shout, \u201cVenezuelans are selling their increasingly worthless Bol\u00edvars for bitcoin, and have been for some time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because the Bolivar is still a viable currency, despite the ongoing hyperinflation. A bitcoin seller can still transfer the currency into another form of currency. The market is still liquid for Bolivars, although not for much longer.\n\nWorse, holding bitcoin in a country that is no longer in civil control will not be of any value to the buyer/owner.\n\nIf a fiat currency totally collapses, the resulting civil unrest may very well take out the power grid. Those people who have cryptocurrencies may not even be able to access them.\n\nIf Fiat Currency Collapses, Only Tangible Goods Will Matter\n\nMore to the point, people living in these countries will only be in need of the basics for survival: food, water, shelter, guns, and ammo.\n\nOffering to pay for these necessities in the form of bitcoin is not going to do the seller any good, because bitcoin will not be of any tangible value in these moments of need.\n\nDoes the seller think he will be able to convert bitcoin into US dollars, walk over to the local bank, and withdraw US dollars? That\u2019s not going to happen, because the banks will already be holding nothing but worthless local currency\u2026if they aren\u2019t on fire.\n\nEven worse, bitcoin is insanely volatile.\n\nAnyone that does manage to change their local currency into bitcoin may find that the value of the bitcoin they just purchased declines by a substantial amount in a matter of minutes.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen this happen multiple times, it\u2019s going to continue to happen, and that\u2019s because of the very thing that the coin both love to crow about: the limited number of available bitcoins. In a limited market with high demand, there will always be volatility that is far above average.\n\nThe Final Irony of Bitcoin Value\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of how one actually measures the value of a bitcoin. In an ironic scenario worthy of O. Henry, how is the value of bitcoin expressed around the world? In terms of the local fiat currency!\n\nFor as much as they grow about the replacement of fiat currency, pickling bulls value their cryptocurrencies in terms of that very same fiat currency.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxUwKd6FoEw\n\nIf fiat currency is worthless, what is a bitcoin actually worth? It\u2019s worth whatever someone is willing to barter or trade for.\n\nAgain, in periods of civil unrest, the things that are actually traded are tangible objects.\n\nIf I\u2019m going to sell you a gun, how many bitcoins are you going to pay me for it, when a bitcoin doesn\u2019t do me any good in terms of surviving?\n\nThe fiat currency replacement argument does not work. Bitcoin is, frankly, for suckers in the long term. The best you can do is trade like a whale."

        "title": "Why Many Crypto Stocks Soared Last Month -- Without a Bitcoin Tailwind - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "What happened\n\nMany companies with deep ties to the cryptocurrency market saw strong stock gains in July 2023. MicroStrategy (MSTR -4.18%) posted a 27.9% gain last month, CleanSpark (CLSK 3.76%) shares rose by 40%, and Riot Platforms (RIOT 0.95%) took the lead with a 56.7% price increase, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nMoves like these usually come alongside rising Bitcoin (BTC -0.30%) prices, but that was not the case last month. Bitcoin actually saw its token prices sliding 3.9% lower over the same period. So why did Cleanspark, MicroStrategy, and Riot soar without that typical tailwind at their backs?\n\nSo what\n\nThe crypto-adjacent industry demonstrated its commitment to mining and owning Bitcoin for the long haul.\n\nFor example, Riot's operations report on July 6 paid more attention to the Bitcoin-mining company's equipment purchases and installations than to the 460 tokens Riot mined and 400 coins sold in June. Furthermore, the report highlighted Riot's ability to scale down its Bitcoin production and resell energy to a strained Texan power grid as the heat waves of June kept air conditioners running.\n\nFellow Bitcoin miner CleanSpark wasn't affected by the Texas heat, with most of its mining equipment hosted in Washington state. So the company ran its slightly smaller collection of mining rigs at full capacity, producing 491 new coins in July and selling 413 of them in order to finance operations. At the same time, CleanSpark shone a spotlight on its expanding facilities in Washington and recently acquired assets in Georgia. The company is buying thousands of mining machines, securing energy supplies to power them, and expanding its Bitcoin-mining capacity as quickly as possible.\n\nMicroStrategy is a different story. The business intelligence software specialist doesn't mine new Bitcoins like CleanSpark and Riot do, but bends over backward to invest in the cryptocurrency. As revealed in the second-quarter earnings release on Aug. 1, the company bought 12,333 new Bitcoins in the second quarter and held a total of 152,800 tokens on its balance sheet by the end of July. The purchases were backed by MicroStrategy's operating cash flows and available credit facilities.\n\nOn top of these Bitcoin-bullish moves, the global and American economies showed signs of life in July. These three stocks posted their strongest gains of the month on July 13, rising in tandem as inflation rose slower than expected. That's good news in the long run for debt-burdened businesses, and these three Bitcoin wranglers fit that bill.\n\nNow what\n\nIt's worth mentioning that companies adjacent to the crypto industry often amplify the gains and drops of the underlying digital assets. In this case, Bitcoin itself was unmoved by the economy's quirks because the cryptocurrency itself has nothing to do with interest rates on financial debt. But CleanSpark has more debt than cash on hand, and MicroStrategy has sunk 97% of its cash into Bitcoin ownership. Riot Platforms has the cleanest balance sheet of this bunch, but even this solid business would be up the creek without a digital paddle if Bitcoin prices drop again.\n\nSo it's no shock to see Riot, CleanSpark, and MicroStrategy making big moves in one direction while Bitcoin slowly slides in the opposite direction. These stocks can be seen as a jumpy harbinger of the distant future -- today's risk-relieving economy trends may pave the way to even faster mining facility builds and Bitcoin buys in upcoming quarters.\n\nAs for Bitcoin's modest price changes in recent weeks, the leading cryptocurrency strikes me as an indispensable investment idea right now. This is not the time or the place to go into a detailed discussion of that idea, but you can read up on the upcoming \"halvening\" event right here."

        "content": "Since its inception, Bitcoin has been steadily growing. A pizza that was once worth 10,000 BTC is now just 0.00058 BTC. Well, the price of Pizza has not gone down. It\u2019s the Bitcoin that went all the way from $0 to $30,000.\n\nToday, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is $574 billion, the highest among all the other currencies. It represents a market dominance of 46.65% despite many ups and downs. Growing at a CAGR of 16.3% from 2022 to 2031, the global Bitcoin payments market is expected to hit $3788.2 billion by 2031. The day isn\u2019t far when it will be accepted as a global currency.\n\nLet\u2019s understand what makes Bitcoin popular among consumers and why you should consider enabling crypto payments.\n\n5 factors accelerating Bitcoin\u2019s adoptionFully decentralized & permissionless\n\nBlockchain is an underlying technology that enables permissionless, peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions. This means no intermediaries can govern your transactions. And hence, payments made via Bitcoin can not be blocked or reversed by anyone \u2014 making it a reliable currency for day-to-day transactions.\n\nSeamless global transactions\n\nAccepting money from abroad through banks and traditional payment gateways is time-consuming, expensive, and unreliable. Most of the time, you will end up paying over 30% in transaction fees to these financial institutions. On the contrary, you can start accepting Bitcoins from anywhere around the world in real time whilst paying minimal transaction fees.\n\nWide accessibility\n\nAccording to a World Bank report, over 1.4 billion adults are unbanked. These people neither have a bank account nor access to mortgage, debit/credit cards, or online banking services. This cuts them out from all the opportunities to invest, borrow credit, and grow their wealth. Bitcoin can empower these individuals as anyone around the world can access it. All they need is a smartphone and internet connection to transact in Bitcoins. As a merchant, if you start accepting Bitcoins, you will be able to reach a wider audience.\n\nSecurity\n\nBanks are 300 times more susceptible to cyber-attacks \u2014 according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group. Thus, funds parked at your local bank are not 100% safe. Instead, if you use Bitcoin, all your transactions will be encrypted by cryptography and will be stored on Blockchain \u2014 making them permanent and irrevocable. So far, not a single blockchain has been compromised. This makes them a better alternative to fiat money.\n\nRemain anonymous\n\nBitcoin payments are private and anonymous. While you can track and trace all the transactions to their origin, it\u2019s almost impossible to associate a real-world identity with any particular transaction. This allows you to transact anonymously and offer privacy to your customers.\n\n\n\nCompanies embracing Bitcoin as a standard payment method\n\nOver 15,000 businesses around the world are already using Bitcoin as a standard payment method. That\u2019s primarily because crypto payments are cheaper to process, censorship-resistant, and easily transferable. Here are a few popular brands accepting Bitcoins:\n\nMicrosoft\n\nEtsy\n\nTwitch\n\nHome Depot\n\nKFC\n\nVirgin Galactic\n\nThousands of other popular brands and businesses also accept Bitcoins. Check out our list of top companies accepting Bitcoin payments.\n\n\n\nThe future is Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is the future of payments. According to the latest report by Blockware Solutions, Bitcoin adoption will hit 10% in 2030, and post that, the growth will be parabolic, eventually reaching 80% population by 2050.\n\nWe already know only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist in its ecosystem. If we divide that number by 8 billion \u2014 which is the global population \u2014 you can predict the value of Bitcoin in the coming years. Owning just one Bitcoin today and holding it for a long time could end up generating generational wealth.\n\nA boost in Bitcoin\u2019s adoption will trigger a massive increase in the number of businesses accepting crypto payments.\n\nAre you ready for the paradigm shift?\n\nIf you are a business owner, now is the right time to start accepting Bitcoin payments. Enabling Bitcoin transactions across your online and offline touchpoints will help you enhance your checkout experience, reach a larger audience, and save hundreds of thousands of dollars in transaction fees.\n\nSign up with Speed- Leadning Bitcoin Payment Processor today to start accepting Bitcoins on the go. From dynamic payment QRs to a mobile Point-of-sale application and pre-built checkout page, Speed offers a wide range of payment features for accepting Bitcoins across your online and offline channels.

        "title": "Beware The Crypto SPOT ETF Bubble - Morningstar",
        "content": "The evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape has been an exhilarating journey filled with astonishing stories of rags-to-riches wealth, regulatory hurdles, and alleged fraud.\n\nDespite these challenges, the cryptocurrency market has surpassed the remarkable point of over $1 trillion (\u00a3787.5 billion) in market capitalisation in the second quarter of 2023. It\u2019s a point 10 years in the making. The first crypto-related fund, the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), was launched in 2013, and over the years the number of crypto-related funds has skyrocketed.\n\nThe first key turning point was the bull run of 2017, when the price of Bitcoin shot up. As Bitcoin rose, so did the number of crypto products. Subsequently, between 2018 and 2020, the market lost most of its gains and several funds faced closure. The post-Covid-19 era then brought another bull run in the crypto market and the number of crypto products once more exploded across the United States and Europe, demanding the attention of investors worldwide.\n\nThe euphoria was tainted in the crypto winter. 2022 proved to be a disastrous for cryptocurrencies, with notable liquidations at Terra, Three Arrows, and FTX. Until that point, most crypto investments revolved around Crypto-based ETFs and Trusts.\n\nDespite the turbulence, crypto has managed to remain in the spotlight, thanks to recent developments at the Securities and Exchange Commission, where the US regulator is reviewing proposals for Crypto Spot ETFs and the launch of leveraged futures ETFs.\n\nA Bull Market Phenomenon\n\nCrypto managed investment products come in various sizes and shapes, including physical crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), synthetic crypto ETPs, and inverse crypto ETPs.\n\nThe below visual demonstrates the recent launches and shutdowns of crypto ETPs as discussed in our earlier paper Cryptos Are a Bull Market Phenomenon. Over the last year, the number of funds being liquidated has risen significantly. On average, all the funds that get liquidated have an average life of less than one year and average assets of around $500,000 at shutdown.\n\nLeveraged Crypto ETPs\n\nThe latest product to join the crypto bandwagon is leveraged crypto ETPs. The SEC approved the first ever leveraged crypto ETF with the launch of Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) in late June 2023. BITX seeks to provide daily investment results, before fees and expenses, which correspond to twice the performance of the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index for a single day. The fund does not invest directly in bitcoin. Instead, it seeks to mimic the performance of bitcoin futures contracts daily.\n\nLike all leveraged products, these are inherently highly risky. Add to that the risk associated with the overall crypto market, the performance of leveraged crypto ETFs can be highly unpredictable.\n\nThe chart above shows this ETF's daily returns compares it with the return of Bitcoin and S&P 500. As is evident, the leveraged ETF\u2019s daily returns have been highly volatile, with a standard deviation of 4.3% daily. In comparison, Bitcoin had a daily standard deviation of about 1.6 % and the broader equity markets had a daily standard deviation of around 1% during the same period. This shows the asset is not only much riskier than equities, but also much more volatile than Bitcoin itself.\n\nOne salient feature of leveraged products is their downward returns bias, which arises from the compounding effect of leveraged returns. As these financial instruments aim to magnify the daily performance of the underlying asset, fluctuations over time can lead to underperformance compared to the asset's cumulative return. The compounding effect can cause the leveraged product to lose value \u2013 even when the underlying asset returns to its initial level.\n\nFor instance, suppose Bitcoin Futures (the underlying market for BITX) and BITX are both currently trading at $100. If the futures fall by 10% in a day, BITX itself can be expected to fall by 20% on that day. This brings the price of the futures contract to $90 and the price of BITX to $80. If on the subsequent day, Bitcoin Futures rise by 11.1%, the price of the future goes back to the original price of $100. However, BITX rises by 22.2% which brings its price to $97.76 \u2013 still short of the original price of $100 by 2.24%. This negative performance bias can compound significantly over time. This is explained in the below visual. The phenomenon is more pronounced in volatile markets, making leveraged products better suited for short-term trading.\n\nAs of July 17, the fund has assets under management to the tune of $22.5 million. Much like other digital assets funds, it too has a high expense ratio of 1.85%.\n\nSpot Price-Based Crypto ETFs\n\nThe SEC was rigorous in rejecting crypto spot ETF proposals. Its concerns centred around the regulation of underlying Crypto Spot exchanges leading to market manipulation and liquidity issues.\n\nHowever, recently SEC started accepting applications from several leading fund houses, including Blackrock, Fidelity, Vaneck, WisdomTree, and Bitwise for US crypto spot ETFs. While the formal approval process may take some time to be completed, it\u2019s clear change is coming. What\u2019s more, Europe is ready to launch the first ever spot price based crypto ETF.\n\nAfter a delay forced by the crypto winter of 2022, Jacobi Asset Management has now announced the launch of Europe\u2019s first Bitcoin ETF. Registered in Guernsey, the new ETF will expose investors to actual shares, unlike previous crypto products.\n\nThe sequence of events has brought around renewed optimism into the crypto market, pushing bitcoin and related investment vehicles higher. Still, traders in the perpetual futures market tied to bitcoin remain risk averse, unwilling to take on high leverage.\n\nDespite bitcoin holding the $30,000 mark for quite some time now, data tracked by Blockware Solutions show the ratio of open interest in BTC perpetual futures to bitcoin's market cap has been locked in a narrow range around 1.5% since late June. The ratio remains well below the high of 2.6% seen in September last year. The ratio is a popular indicator of the risk appetite of the investors. A stagnant ratio indicates money has been slow to flow into the market despite the Bitcoin price rise.\n\nAnother metric that can be used to gauge investor risk sentiment is the estimated leverage ratio (ELR), which estimates the amount of leverage in use on average. The ELR has dropped significantly since September 2022 and has stayed in the same ballpark since May 2023. Despite the apparent bullishness (owing to the news of launch of new products), investors and traders remain cautious and have not increased their leverage, even with Bitcoin inching higher.\n\nSimilar products were also launched in other countries, including Canada, Brazil, and Dubai. But they received limited investor attention. The average assets under management (AUM) of a few of the earliest and largest Canadian crypto spot ETFs has changed over time, and it shows the same pattern: optimism when products are launched followed by a period of dull growth and poor performance.\n\nNo Hedge, No Edge\n\nA major reason for investors flocking to Crypto products has been the belief that they can provide a reasonable hedge against equity and inflation. However, the correlation of crypto returns with both US CPI and the Morningstar Global Markets Index shows massive swings on both sides. This suggests a lack of conclusive evidence to support the notion that crypto-exposed products could serve as a reliable hedge against inflation or equity volatility.\n\nFool\u2019s Gold?\n\nMany investors and influencers have comparied crypto and gold, drawing parallels between the emergence of gold investing in the 1970s and the modern rise of crypto. Back then, gold was a largely unregulated asset and the launch of gold products and ETFs in subsequent years helped its adoption as a reliable alternative asset by conventional investors.\n\nTheir hypothesis is crypto should be thought of as a commodity, and that, much like gold, the launch of mainstream crypto products will help with the mainstream adoption of crypto too. However, gold does provide an established hedge against both equity and inflation. The chart below shows that, during any major equity market correction, Gold has risen to the mark and worked as a perfect hedge. Crypto, on the other hand, has shown no such benefits. We believe cryptocurrencies should not be identified as an asset class or as a commodity. Why? Because it has no fundamental features that resemble either.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nData suggests the optimistic turn of events has had almost no significant impact on investor outcomes. Crypto investors still seem to be concerned with the challenges the space represents, especially the volatility and the regulatory uncertainty around it. Perhaps the launch of the spot ETF is not as revolutionary as is being portrayed to be. Even if it is, few recent crypto products have lived past their initial hype, so this one may suffer the same fate.\n\nAs such, it is important investors take a long-term perspective and are prudent about market conditions. We believe retail investors are better off waiting on the sidelines to see if these products see the light of the day and can garner enough traction, let alone convincing performance. Thorough due diligence is very important, because there is simply more to lose than to gain."

        "content": "Weekly cryptocurrency asset flows for the week ending Aug. 4 reconciled at $107 million in outflows, continuing a three-week negative trend totaling $134.8 million.\n\nOnce again, the lion\u2019s share of movement was attributed to Bitcoin (BTC). With $111 million in outflows, Bitcoin funds negated the majority of inflows for the week.\n\nAccording to CoinShares\u2019 \u201cDigital Asset Fund Flows\" weekly report, this indicates further \u201cprofit taking\u201d on the heels of the previous cycle\u2019s gains. For the month leading up to the recent spate of outflows, inflows of $742 million into crypto funds were seen, with 99% of that coming into Bitcoin.\n\nWeekly crypto asset flows. Source: CoinShares\n\nWeekly trading volumes in investment products saw a dip below the year-to-date average, according to the report, with broader on-exchange market volumes down 62% against the relative average.\n\nRegionally, only Australia and the United States showed inflows, with $0.3 million and $0.2 million incoming, respectively. The largest regional outflows came from Canada, with $70.8 million, and Germany, with $28.5 million.\n\nDespite Bitcoin\u2019s outflows, the weekly total was somewhat buoyed by inflows into Solana (SOL) in the amount of $9.5 million, up from last week\u2019s total of $0.6 million in inflows. XRP (XRP) investment products also saw inflows of $0.5 million.\n\nEther (ETH) funds continue their negative trend, adding $5.9 million in outflows to the previous week\u2019s $1.9 million. This entirely offsets prior inflows in the amount of $6.6 million and further separates it from Solana\u2019s current bullish trend.\n\nWhile Bitcoin remains up for the year compared to its opening in January, many experts believe some of the perceived sideways movement that\u2019s kept it mostly beneath $30,000 since April is due to market uncertainty.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, data from Switzerland-based investment adviser 21e6 Capital AG shows that Bitcoin \u201chodlers,\u201d those who held funds in BTC, outperformed crypto funds by 69% in the first half of 2023.\n\nThe 2022 implosion of FTX and regulatory and legal uncertainty for numerous other exchanges may have tempted crypto fund investors to increase the amount of cash on hand versus invested funds, thus causing the current decay.\n\nThe report from 21e6 Capital AG did note that investor sentiment currently appears to be slightly up versus the first half of 2023.\n\nRelated: European digital asset manager CoinShares\u2019 revenue up 33% in Q2"

        "content": "In recent weeks, Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a significant price correction, with the leading cryptocurrency struggling to reclaim the $30,000 psychological threshold it surged past earlier this year.\n\nDespite a sharp upswing fueled by growing institutional interest earlier this year, the cryptocurrency\u2019s inability to maintain its gains has raised concerns and left investors closely monitoring the volatile market.\n\nRather than the flagship digital asset moving upwards, it appears that there\u2019s a 50% chance that BTC will crash as low as $25,000 before the end of September, according to leading investment manager Timothy Peterson tweeted on August 7.\n\nHowever, such a drop would mark the last major dip before Bitcoin embarks on the next, long-awaited bull run, the investor added.\n\n\u201cThere is a 50% chance that bitcoin will drop below $25,000 before the end of September. This would be the last big dip before the next big bull run cycle commences.\u201d \u2013 Peterson wrote in the tweet.\n\nSeptember, Bitcoin\u2019s worst-performing month\n\nPeterson\u2019s remarks on a possible drop in BTC price next month are based on the crypto coin\u2019s historical performance.\n\nNotably, as evident from the below image, September is by far the least favorable month of the year for Bitcoin in terms of price performance.\n\nOver the past 7 years, the only time Bitcoin saw positive price gains in September was in 2016, when it rose 6.4%. On the flip side, from 2017 to 2022, BTC was in the red every time during this month, with its losses ranging from -2.95% to -13.8%, Peterson\u2019s table shows.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s historical performance per month. Source: Timothy Peterson\n\nHowever, October is one of the best-performing months for the biggest crypto coin. Since 2010, the only occasion when Bitcoin recorded a negative price change in this month was in 2018, when it fell by 4.5%.\n\nNovember and December marked mixed price performance for Bitcoin in previous years, although it is worth noting that some of its sharpest price drops came during the former month.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nAt the time of publication, Bitcoin was changing hands at $28,989, almost unchanged in the past 24 hours.\n\nOver the past week, BTC lost 1% of its value, while its monthly loss currently stands at 4%.\n\nBTC 1-month price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nYear-to-date, however, BTC\u2019s gains remain strong at around 75%.\n\nOn August 4, pseudonymous crypto market analyst TradingShot highlighted that Bitcoin completed the third-ever golden cross pattern, which serves as a long-term bullish price signal.\n\nAccording to the expert, the previous two occasions where Bitcoin completed this pattern led to strong price rallies for the maiden cryptocurrency.\n\nThe prediction is somewhat in line with Peterson\u2019s comments that while Bitcoin may struggle with some near-term pressure, the long-term outlook currently looks promising for the biggest crypto asset.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "A cryptoasset specialist says a bitcoin rally could be forming due to anticipation for the cryptocurrency\u2019s next \u2018halving\u2019 event, which is expected to take place next year.\n\nPeter Habermacher, chief executive of London-based cryptoassets investment specialist Aaro Capital, says that historical data shows a crypto bull market typically commences more than a year before a bitcoin halving.\n\nA bitcoin halving event is anticipated to happen next in April/May 2024 and results in the rate of bitcoin supply being halved.\n\nCrypto has historically followed an approximately four-year market cycle, with \u201cexuberant and parabolic market peaks followed by severe and painful bear markets\u201d, writes Habermacher in an article.\n\nCrypto market cycles have \u201croughly\u201d followed Bitcoin\u2019s halving events, meaning the market is now approaching the end of another cycle, according to Habermacher.\n\nHe says that Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is increasing again \u2013 a sign that the major cryptocurrency is recovering from a bear market. Historically bitcoin has recovered first from bear markets, but it tends to lag other cryptocurrencies in the later stages of a bull run.\n\nOne data source that has evidenced this in the past is blockchain data, which Habermacher says provides the ability to recognise patterns and behaviours of blockchain users via their transactional data. He writes that current data is consistent with previous crypto market cycles.\n\n\u201cIf the crypto market evolves in a similar way as previous market cycles, we can have increasing confidence that we are in the transition phase out of the 2022 bear market and into the next crypto bull market.\u201d\n\nFurther data from technical analysis \u2013 which indicate prices that traders and investors are happy to buy at \u2013 also suggests that \u201cgreener pastures\u201d are ahead, as there has been a clear change in the behaviour of market participants, who are \u201cexhibiting early bull market behaviour.\n\nIn his article, Habermacher also mentions other market factors to watch, which on the negative side, include bottlenecks at service providers.\n\n\u00a9 2023 funds europe"

        "content": "BlackRock, a multinational investment company, shocked many in the cryptocurrency industry in June when it filed an application for an exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Bitcoin Trust. It\u2019s seeking to overcome 10-year-long opposition from United States regulators to cryptocurrency ETFs. A spot Bitcoin ETF would be tradable on a traditional stock exchange and track with the market.\n\nWhile supporters argue that ETFs are tax-efficient, easy to trade and cheap, BlackRock\u2019s approach is arguably misguided. It is important to keep in mind that ETFs do not have the same focus or goals as Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nProblems with the traditional finance sector\n\nThe traditional finance sector has long been dominated by institutions that control the flow of capital and dictate the terms of finance. Many people feel disenfranchised by these institutions, feeling they have restricted access to wealth creation, developing barriers for individuals and small businesses.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin ETFs: Even worse for crypto than central exchanges\n\nTherefore, the arrival of cryptocurrencies presented a significant opportunity to offer an alternative to the traditional finance system that promises increased autonomy, inclusivity and transparency. However, merging traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) is critical for mass adoption.\n\nBitcoin ETF next deadline August 13th\n\n\n\n(But this is for the ARK re-filing)\n\n\n\nLikely gets postponed IMO while most eyes will be watching Sept 2nd for BlackRock ETF deadline\n\n\n\nBlackRock likely the first approved, if any, as the rest are just re-filing pic.twitter.com/h2ESr6aMnp \u2014 Rager (@Rager) August 5, 2023\n\nWe need to move toward an industry where DeFi can serve legacy financial institutions rather than view them as targets. Major banks and players want to get into crypto, but there is also a potential for the general public to enter this new world in the future and address the many limitations or barriers associated with the traditional finance sector. The arrival of ETFs represents the financial industry\u2019s attempts to integrate the innovation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nETFs promote centralization\n\nThere are many different kinds of cryptocurrency exchanges. The most popular are centralized exchanges \u2014 like FTX. Centralized exchanges hold the private keys to their clients\u2019 wallets, and they generally require users to undergo a Know Your Customer (KYC) process to help curb illicit and illegal activities.\n\nDecentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, by contrast, are built atop a decentralized, noncustodial blockchain system that supports direct peer-to-peer transactions. This approach essentially removes the need for intermediaries. Users do not have to complete the KYC process \u2014 which means people living under repressive governments have an opportunity to participate. They also maintain autonomy over their private keys and are solely responsible for the security of their funds \u2014 which they can stake to earn interest.\n\nRelated: Don\u2019t be naive \u2014 BlackRock\u2019s ETF won\u2019t be bullish for Bitcoin\n\nCrypto\u2019s ability to offer these advantages \u2014 especially to unbanked users who are unable to access traditional banking services \u2014 is the entire point of the industry.\n\nETFs, on the other hand, are inherently centralized products, creating a conflict with the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They offer none of the advantages that comprise the foundation of cryptocurrency, nor do they encourage new users to become involved.\n\nIn addition to undermining Bitcoin\u2019s core principles of decentralization and trustless transactions, ETFs also introduce the problem of \u201cpaper\u201d Bitcoin \u2014 BTC that exists only on paper. With no ability to withdraw the \u201cBitcoin\u201d you supposedly own, the prospect of FTX-style catastrophes arising in the future becomes much likelier.\n\nWe need to demystify cryptocurrency \u2014 not create a \u201cCrypto for Dummies\u201d fund\n\nMost people do not grasp the basics of Bitcoin, nonfungible tokens or cryptocurrencies in general. It\u2019s critical that those of us who are in cryptocurrency identify a comfortable entry point into the crypto world for the general public to engage. Demystifying cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin will lead to broader adoption. Transforming Bitcoin into an easily tradable asset could dilute its role as a revolutionary decentralized currency.\n\nTraditional finance should be leveraged as a stabilizing force. Its structures could potentially offer stability to the volatile crypto market. If implemented properly, they could provide security, accessibility and trust, and even attract more mainstream investors to cryptocurrencies. Strict regulatory oversight could also legitimize Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies for the general public and financial institutions.\n\nThere is a huge need for evolution in traditional finance. Institutions must adapt and evolve to fully embrace cryptocurrencies. They should incorporate the ethos of decentralization and autonomy that cryptocurrencies represent rather than simply integrating Bitcoin into existing structures. And that means BlackRock should consider putting the kibosh on its Bitcoin ETF.\n\nDaniele Servadei is the co-founder and CEO of Sellix, an e-commerce platform based in Italy.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "title": "Buying Bitcoin Spark in the ICO is similar to early Shiba Inu before it skyrocketed, analyst claims - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin Spark (BTCS) emerges into the crypto scene with exciting offers making the crypto onboarding process easier. Its ICO, featuring one BTCS at $1.50 and bonuses to boost it, appeals to investors with its affordable entry price. According to crypto watchers, buying Bitcoin Spark during its ICO phase is akin to getting in early on Shiba Inu before its meteoric rise.\n\nBitcoin Spark\n\nBTCS is running an exciting ICO, leaving investors to imagine buying Bitcoin when it was $1 or investing in SHIB at its early stages. Furthermore, early investors expect up to 800% returns by investing in BTCS\u2019 first phase. The project will launch at $10 as the project seeks to maintain similar Bitcoin tokenomics.\n\nBitcoin Spark deploys an all-new \u201cProof-Of-Process\u201d blockchain technology (PoP), combining various aspects of PoS and PoW. This Bitcoin fork runs on Ethereum and strives for speed and scalability, which are lacking in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Spark takes the best of both worlds and introduces a new way of validating transactions through PoP. Users in the Bitcoin Spark network can similarly stake their coins to a PoS blockchain, providing a financial stake in the network\u2019s security and integrity. Additionally, they can contribute their processing power to perform PoW tasks as part of the consensus process. This innovative approach ensures that the network remains decentralized and secure while achieving high efficiency in transaction validation.\n\nBy leveraging PoP, Bitcoin Spark aims to address scalability and transaction costs, two critical challenges many cryptocurrencies face, including Bitcoin. The network\u2019s ability to process several transactions quickly and cost-effectively makes it a more practical choice for everyday use. This process is made possible by a Bitcoin Spark application, which can also act as a wallet for cryptocurrency-safe custody. The app supports Android, Linux, Mac OS, iOS, and Windows.\n\nFurthermore, the PoS and PoW combination in Bitcoin Spark creates a balanced ecosystem where users are incentivized to hold and stake their coins for security and governance purposes while actively contributing to the validation process. This dual approach fosters a healthier and more inclusive network, reducing the risk of centralization and enhancing overall decentralization. Bitcoin Spark\u2019s use of the innovative Proof-Of-Process mechanism and its integration of PoS and PoW elements set it apart from other cryptocurrencies in the market. With its focus on scalability, cost-effectiveness, and security, Bitcoin Spark is positioning itself as a promising digital currency with the potential to address the challenges of the original Bitcoin network and become a key player in the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nShiba Inu price\n\nThe current Shiba Inu price hovers around $ 0.0000086 with a circulating supply of 589 trillion SHIB and a 24-hour trading volume of $227,769,724. Prospective investors can buy Shiba Inu at the prevailing Shiba Inu price on top exchanges.\n\nWill Shiba Inu go up?\n\nThe Shiba Inu ecosystem has tried several measures in the hope of developing real use cases for this meme coin. Recent developments indicate an impending Shibarium launch, with the team optimistic of a price rise. However, Shiba Inu price and any other cryptocurrency are subject to various factors, including market sentiment, adoption, technology developments, and overall market conditions. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and if you are considering investing in Shiba Inu or any other cryptocurrency, it\u2019s essential to research, understand the risks, and make informed decisions based on your situation.\n\nWrap Up\n\nBitcoin Spark (ICO presents an opportunity similar to Shiba Inu\u2019s early days before its meteoric rise. With its unique blockchain technology and the integration of innovative features, Bitcoin Spark is an intriguing opportunity for investors seeking to participate in the cryptocurrency space and capitalize on its innovative features and potential for growth.\n\nWebsite: https://bitcoinspark.org/\n\nBuy BTCS: https://network.bitcoinspark.org/register\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "title": "Bitcoin forms third-ever golden cross - road to new record high begins? - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) has maintained its value below the $30,000 mark, with the asset failing to break past the key resistance level amid extended consolidation across the general market. However, Bitcoin\u2019s technical analysis suggests that the asset might be on the road to another all-time high based on historical price movements.\n\nIn particular, pseudonymous crypto trading analyst TradingShot, in a post on TradingView on August 4, observed that the maiden cryptocurrency has just completed the third-ever golden cross pattern, a bullish price signal in the long term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAccording to the analysis, the previous two instances of the pattern led to significant price rallies for Bitcoin. Once the cross occurred, the 200-day moving averages calculated on a three-day time frame (3D MA 200) turned into a crucial support level, helping sustain the uptrend.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that the exceptional circumstances of the March 2020 coronavirus crash, which he equated to a Black Swan, caused a temporary disruption in the typical pattern.\n\nDrawing parallels to previous cycles, the analyst emphasized that with the 3D MA50 guiding the price action, the next likely target for Bitcoin\u2019s upward movement would be its all-time high, which was last at $69,000.\n\nAdditionally, he attributed the relatively faster attainment of the 2019 golden cross to the \u201cLibra euphoria\u201d and other positive fundamentals that contributed to the increased adoption of Bitcoin. Conversely, in 2020, reaching the all-time high took a little longer, taking around 100 days more than the previous cycle.\n\n\u201cIt could be a fair estimate that Bitcoin would have reached the current ATH ($69,000) by around this time next year,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat next for Bitcoin after hitting a golden cross?\n\nThe golden cross pattern occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. In the case of Bitcoin\u2019s recent golden cross, the price was trading above the 3D MA50 and 3D MA200, indicating a positive trend shift for the digital asset.\n\nIn general, Bitcoin\u2019s price has experienced volatility recently, and the impact of the golden cross is seen as a sign of optimism in the asset\u2019s price trajectory. Notably, there is a consensus regarding the possibility of Bitcoin rallying to new highs.\n\nAs reported by Finbold, a significant number of Bitcoin holders (69.2%) have no intention of selling their assets but prefer \u2018Hodling.\u2019 At the same time, the amount of Bitcoin sent to exchanges has also dropped in recent weeks.\n\nIt is anticipated that the next Bitcoin halving, slated for 2024, could trigger the commencement of a new market cycle. In the short term, Bitcoin faces threats of declining further below the $29,000 mark. A Finbold report indicated that machine learning algorithms project the asset is likely to trade at $28,000 at the end of August.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBy press time, Bitcoin was trading at $29,014 with minor gains of less than 0.1% in the last 24 hours.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nElsewhere, under technical analysis, as retrieved from TradingView, indicators suggest bearishness. A summary of the one-day gauges recommends a sell signal and rates 10, similar to moving averages at 9, while oscillators are neutral at 9.\n\nBitcoin technical analysis. Source: TradingView\n\nIn the meantime, with prevailing volatility, the market is keen on how Bitcoin will react in the short term.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
