        "title": "Bitcoin is one year away from a major technical event. History suggests the start of another bull run - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nThe bitcoin halving is an event that happens roughly every four years where rewards to miners are cut in halve, effectively limiting supply of the token. S3studio | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin is nearly a year away from a key technical event \u2014 which might be the catalyst for a prolonged climb in the cryptocurrency's value. In April or May 2024, bitcoin is expected to undergo its next so-called \"halving,\" though the exact date is not yet known. Bitcoin has been rising in the past few weeks in anticipation of the halving, as a potential U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut contends with the prospect of sluggish growth and tightening credit conditions resulting from woes in the banking sector. One bitcoin was worth roughly $30,000 as of Wednesday morning, according to data from CoinGecko. The world's largest cryptocurrency is up by more than 80% since the start of the year. Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, said that the bitcoin jump above $30,000 at a time of bank failures and economic uncertainty suggests the cyclical \"bottom\" for bitcoin is forming.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"This tends to happen a year or so prior to the Bitcoin's halving event, which is slated next for around April 2024,\" Ayyar told CNBC via email.\n\nWhat is the bitcoin halving?\n\nBitcoin halvings take place roughly every four years, or every time another 210,000 \"blocks\" are added to the blockchain. The event cuts the rewards to bitcoin miners \u2014 volunteers running specialized equipment to validate transactions on the network and mint new tokens \u2014 by 50%. The aim is to reduce the number of new bitcoin unit released into the market. Currently, bitcoin miners receive 6.25 bitcoin for each block they successfully mine. This means their computer had the right amount of computing power needed to solve the cryptographic puzzles that secure the bitcoin network and prevent it from being compromised by malicious actors. Once the next bitcoin halving occurs, this reward will be reduced to 3.125 bitcoin.\n\nwatch now\n\nBackers of the cryptocurrency say this can help push up the price by enhancing bitcoin scarcity. The maximum number of bitcoins that will ever exist in circulation is capped at 21 million. This is ensured by the halving mechanism, whereby rewards for mining bitcoin will eventually be slashed to $0. Before the last halving, which took place on May 11, 2020, the price of bitcoin increased by 19% in the preceding 12 months, from $7,191.36 to $8,568.88, according to figures from CCData. During the halving before that \u2014 which occurred on Jul. 9, 2016 \u2014 bitcoin rallied 142% compared with the 12 months prior, moving from $269.14 to $651.83.\n\nThe first ever halving of Nov. 28, 2012 saw the price of bitcoin balloon by 384% to $12.35 from $2.55, CCData's figures show. \"Analysing historical Bitcoin halving patterns, it appears that investors often accumulate Bitcoin in the run-up to the halving event, although the exact timing and extent of returns post-halving can differ,\" Jamie Sly, analyst at CryptoCompare, told CNBC. \"The accumulation period from the market bottom after the breakout to the halving date has historically spanned at least 500 days.\" Sly added: \"This would mean, if we were to assume that the market bottom for this cycle was in November last year (when Bitcoin hit a yearly low of $15,760), then we are only 142 days into the current cycle. This would correlate with the next expected Bitcoin halving date, which is another 378 days ahead.\"\n\nBitcoin's post-halving gains\n\nThe bitcoin price tends to spike even higher, in the months that follow halving. After the halving of May 11, 2020, the cryptocurrency rallied 688.31% in the following 546 days, reaching a then record high of $67,549.14 on Nov. 8, 2021, according to CCData."

        "content": "In addition to relying mostly on clean energy, the Bitcoin network is far more energy efficient than legacy financial systems. Bitcoin mining accounts for less than 0.2% of global energy usage and only 0.09% of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Bitcoin, often compared to gold as a store of value, uses less energy than gold to mine and has none of the heavy metal pollutants caused by gold mining. Simply replacing gold or the legacy financial system with a bitcoin standard would be a huge net positive for the environment."

        "content": "Warren Buffett doesn\u2019t see much value in Bitcoin, despite its recent price rise. The Berkshire Hathaway boss sympathizes, however, with people hoping to get rich quick off it. \u201cSomething like Bitcoin, it is a gambling token, and it doesn\u2019t have any intrinsic value. But that doesn\u2019t stop people from wanting to play the roulette wheel,\u201d Buffett said during an appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin was trading at more than $30,000 on Thursday, having started the year at below $17,000. But it\u2019s still down considerably from its peak of nearly $69,000 in November 2021.\n\nIn mid-February, Mike Novogratz, CEO of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital, noted the \u201cFOMO building up\u201d around Bitcoin, referring to the \u201cfear of missing out.\u201d At the time, Bitcoin was trading at just below $24,800, and Novogratz said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if it hit $30,000 by the end of March.\n\nThough Buffett didn\u2019t mention FOMO, he said on Wednesday, \u201cThe urge to participate in something where it looks like easy money is a human instinct which has been unleashed. People love the idea of getting rich quick, and I don\u2019t blame them\u2026It\u2019s so human, and once unleashed you can\u2019t put it back in the bottle.\u201d\n\nBuffett and Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger have a long record of bashing Bitcoin.\n\nIn 2018, Buffett said Bitcoin is \u201cprobably rat poison squared\u201d at the Berkshire Hathaway 2018 shareholder meeting. He added on CNBC at the time, \u201cWhen you\u2019re buying nonproductive assets, all you\u2019re counting on is the next person is going to pay you more because they\u2019re even more excited about another next person coming along.\u201d\n\nWhen he made those comments, Bitcoin was trading a bit lower than $10,000, far below the heights it would reach in the years ahead. But Buffett and Munger have been consistent in their criticism of the digital token.\n\nMunger, Buffett\u2019s longtime right-hand man, has been especially harsh. In April last year, he said of Bitcoin, \u201cIt\u2019s stupid because it\u2019s still likely to go to zero,\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s evil because it undermines the Federal Reserve System.\u201d He also commended China for banning Bitcoin.\n\nAnd earlier this year, Munger called for the U.S. to ban cryptocurrencies altogether, saying in a different interview he was \u201cnot proud of my country\u201d for allowing them to thrive.\n\nBut Bitcoin bulls continue to predict massive surges in the coin\u2019s value. In February, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, who is heavily invested in crypto, predicted Bitcoin would hit $1.48 million by 2030, up from her earlier $1 million forecast.\n\nOn the other hand, Mark Mobius, the billionaire cofounder of Mobius Capital Partners, predicted in December that Bitcoin would fall to $10,000 at some point this year."

        "content": "What if you could open trading positions with more funds than you actually had in your account? Imagine having $1,000 deposited but being able to effectively trade with $2,000, $3,000, or even $10,000.\n\nWell, that\u2019s entirely possible on many cryptocurrency exchanges and it\u2019s called margin or leveraged trading.\n\nWelcome to our how-to guide. In the following lines, you will learn what margin trading in Bitcoin and crypto is, how it works, top exchanges that enable margin trading, and most importantly \u2013 you will also learn some must-read tips before placing even the smallest margin position.\n\nQuick Navigation:\n\nWhat is Bitcoin Margin Trading?\n\nIn this guide, we will mostly focus on Bitcoin margin trading because BTC is the largest cryptocurrency by market cap with the most considerable trading volume across all exchanges. However, the rules and tips hereby discussed apply to all supported altcoins for margin trading, i.e. Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL) and more.\n\nIn essence, crypto margin trading is a way of using funds provided by a third party \u2013 usually the exchange that you\u2019re using.\n\nMargin trading amplifies the results of your trading in both ways \u2013 it can expand your profits, but it could also deepen your losses. This ability to multiply the trading results is what makes it very popular in low-volatility markets. Nevertheless, crypto margin trading is also very popular and enjoys a steady increase in its overall volume overtime.\n\nFor example, if we opened a Bitcoin margin position with a 2X leverage and Bitcoin had increased by 10%, then our position would have yielded 20% because of the 2X leverage. With no leverage, it would have been only a 10% ROI.\n\nMargin leverage can also be 25X and even higher, despite the risk, the same position as described above would have yielded 250% (instead of 10% with no leverage).\n\nBest Bitcoin & Crypto Margin Trading Exchanges\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Margin Trading Work?\n\nIn most cases, the user can borrow funds through the exchange, and these funds are either sourced by other users who earn interest or by the exchange itself.\n\nThis way, traders can increase their trading capital and open larger positions. The exchange doesn\u2019t carry a lot of risks since every position has its liquidation price, which is based on the amount of borrowed margin.\n\nHow to Short Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies?\n\nDo you want to have the option to make gains while the Bitcoin price is decreasing? With margin trading, it\u2019s possible. A short position on Bitcoin basically means that you bet that the BTC price will decline.\n\nThe way it works is quite simple. In essence, you Bitcoin at current prices, sell it and then rebuy later when the price drops. It may be a bit confusing, so let\u2019s make an example.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine that Bitcoin is currently trading at $10,000, and you have $10,000 in your Binance margin account. Using this as collateral, you can borrow 2 BTC (for example) and sell it at current prices for $20,000. Now you have $10,000 of your own money and $20,000 of borrowed funds, and you have to repay 2 BTC to the exchange.\n\nYour plan goes as intended, and the price of BTC drops to $8,000. You decide it\u2019s time to make some profits. You buy 2 BTC (because that\u2019s how much you have to buy back) for $16,000. Remember that you sold them for $20,000. This means that after you repay your loan (of 2 BTC), you will have $4,000 more in your account \u2013 welcome, those are your profits. Of course, that assumes there are no fees, but it\u2019s also only for simplification purposes.\n\nCross Margin vs. Isolated Margin\n\nOn many exchanges, such as Binance Futures, users can use cross-margin and isolated margin modes.\n\nThe difference between both is the margin balance used to avoid liquidation. If cross-margin is enabled, the entire margin balance is shared across open positions to prevent liquidations. This means the trader risks losing their entire margin account\u2019s balance alongside any open positions in the event of a liquidation.\n\nIsolated margin refers to the balance that\u2019s allocated to an individual position. This means that the trader can manage their risk on their individual positions by restricting the specific amount of margin that\u2019s allocated to each one of them. If a position gets liquidated, it won\u2019t affect the rest of the trader\u2019s balance or their other open positions. It can also be adjusted individually.\n\nBitcoin Margin Trading Vs. Futures Trading\n\nMany people commonly mistake Bitcoin margin trading for futures trading, but there are fundamental differences to keep in mind. We will break it down into sections to better differentiate between both types of Bitcoin trading.\n\nMarkets\n\nWith Bitcoin margin trading, users place orders to buy or sell directly in the spot market. This essentially means that all orders are matched with those in the spot market. With Bitcoin futures, traders place orders to buy or sell contracts in the derivatives market \u2013 they do not share the same orderbook, therefore, come with different liquidity.\n\nLeverage\n\nWhen trading Bitcoin futures, users can take advantage of very high leverage that would depend on the exchange but usually reaches up to (or even higher than) 100x. With Bitcoin margin trading, users have access to an average between 3x and 10x, depending on the platform.\n\nTrading Fees\n\nSince Bitcoin margin trading and futures take place on entirely different markets, the fees associated with both are usually different. Margin trading usually follows the fees of the spot market, whereas futures trading has fees based on the derivatives market.\n\nMargin Trading Tips: Read Before Placing Orders\n\nSince margin trading is risky, it\u2019s not recommended for beginners. Therefore, if you\u2019re new to this type of trading, we\u2019ve prepared a few must-read tips to help you along the way. Keep in mind that this type of trading carries an amplified risk of losing capital, and you should never trade with funds that you can\u2019t afford to lose.\n\nAlways start trading with small amounts\n\nIs it your first day of margin trading? Even if it\u2019s not, you should consider starting small. Get the necessary confidence and experience before jumping into the deep raging water of margin trading.\n\nDon\u2019t go all in at once\n\nEven if you\u2019re absolutely confident in your trading skills, it\u2019s better to divide your positions into portions and create a ladder of prices. This way, you can reduce the risk while averaging down your entry price. The same is true for taking profit \u2013 you can set up a ladder to take profit on the way up.\n\nUnderstand fees and liquidations\n\nYou must always know how much you pay for fees and what type of fees you pay for.\n\nMargin trading comes with ongoing fees, so make sure they don\u2019t end up eating up your entire profit or, even worse \u2013 your balance. The same is true for keeping tabs on your liquidation price \u2013 you must know that number in case the position starts approaching quicker than expected. This brings us to our next point.\n\nRisk management\n\nWhen trading on margin, set clear risk management rules and make sure to follow them. Don\u2019t get greedy. Take into account the amount of money you are willing to risk, and always know that you can lose it entirely. Always use stop loss levels. This will prevent your entire stack from getting liquidated.\n\nPrice manipulations: short/long squeeze\n\nThe crypto markets remain, for large part, unregulated. It\u2019s not out of the question to see the occasional short and long squeeze events, which also has to do with the current size of the market.\n\nWhen the number of short or long positions is high, it means that a market participant can squeeze these positions by creating an opposing price move, forcing these positions into liquidation, or hunting their stop-loss orders.\n\nMargin for short-term trading\n\nCryptocurrencies remain very volatile assets. Margin trading amplifies the risks associated with trading them even more. Therefore, try to make short-term (compared to spot trading or investment) margin trading positions and keep a constant look at them.\n\nMoreover, remember that you\u2019re paying ongoing fees for the borrowed margin, and even though the daily fees could seem negligible in the short term, they can quickly start to add up.\n\nPay attention to the fundamentals\n\nMajor events that surround the space, such as Bitcoin ETF decisions, SEC regulations, exchanges going under, and so forth, can have a significant impact on the price of BTC.\n\nEven though traders tend to rely mostly on technical analysis, keep in mind that those events might have a critical impact on the market.\n\nUnder extreme volatility \u2013 don\u2019t go away\n\nExtreme price fluctuations are not uncommon when trading Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and they take place in both directions. The risk associated with margin trading is that these wicks will touch your liquidation price and wipe out your entire position. The higher your margin, the closer the liquidation price.\n\nCosts and Risks of Crypto Margin Trading\n\nEven though you are technically using borrowed funds, you can\u2019t end up owing money to the platform, as this would create a huge risk for the exchange itself. Therefore, the most you can lose is what your balance. This event, should it happen, is commonly referred to as liquidation.\n\nThe liquidation price is the point where the exchange will force-close your position automatically. Let\u2019s see an example.\n\nImagine you had 1,000 USDT, and you used that to borrow 1,000 USDT more. Then you use the combined 2,000 USDT to buy BTC. If BTC drops to a point where you would lose your borrowed margin (the 1,000 USDT that you borrowed), the position will close automatically. And since 1,000 is exactly 50% of 2,000, your liquidation price will be 50% below your entry price.\n\nThat\u2019s why we aid that the higher the margin you borrowed is, the closer your liquidation price will be to the entry price. It\u2019s effectively the same as using leverage when futures trading.\n\nAs mentioned above, the costs of keeping a margin position active also includes paying ongoing interest for the borrowed funds, as well as the fees for opening and closing the position with the exchange. Keep in mind that as the chance to earn more increases, so does the risk of losing more.\n\nWant to read more useful tips? Follow our 12 must-read crypto margin trading tips."

The benefits of decentralized tokens have been highlighted in the wake of the recent bank failures, with many proclaiming Bitcoin to be the new digital gold.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI think the rally is explicable by saying people have got freaked out by the banking system by the collapses,\u201d said Oliver Linch, CEO of Bittrex Global.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, co-founder and CEO of Binance, considers Bitcoin to be better than gold.\n\nAs the crypto rally takes off, analysts and institutional investors are betting on Bitcoin to reach its all-time high again this year.\n\n\u201cI think Bitcoin probably breaks all-time highs this year,\u201d said Marshall Beard, chief strategy officer of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, adding that the cryptocurrency could hit the $100,000 mark.\n\nSee Also: The House-Printing Robot Shaking Up a $7.28 Trillion Industry\n\nVijay Ayyar, head of international at crypto exchange Luno, said, \u201cBroadly, we are looking quite bullish here with Bitcoin reclaiming $28K and looking to target $30K next.\u201d\n\nOn March 17, Balaji Srinivasan, former technology chief at crypto exchange Coinbase, bet $2 million that Bitcoin could cross $1 million in just 90 days, as hyperinflation kicks in. Notably, Bitcoin would have to surge by nearly 3,500% within the next three months to reach this mark.\n\nThe blockchain-based gaming market is expected to benefit from the crypto rally to hit a $50 billion valuation by 2025. This marks a 33 times rise from the $1.5 billion market size reported in 2021.\n\nFed Scaling Back And Future Of Crypto\n\nThe Fed\u2019s dovish stance is expected to fuel the bullish case for crypto, as decentralized currencies regain momentum. Typically Bitcoin has outperformed other major asset classes in a bull market.\n\n\"Any time that you've held Bitcoin in a four-year rolling interval, so you pick the day, hold it for four years, you've outperformed every other asset class,\" stated SkyBridge Capital Founder and Managing Partner Anthony Scaramucci.\n\nBut the disappointing jobs report and weak economic data published earlier this week has steered investors to reliable asset classes, including gold. As recession fears set in, crypto could see a massive influx of investments, as people continue to bet on decentralized assets.\n\nTo stay updated with top startup news & investments, sign up for Benzinga\u2019s Startup Investing & Equity Crowdfunding Newsletter\n\nTensions Ahead\n\nThe U.S. Treasury has deemed decentralized finance (DeFi) markets a threat to U.S. national security, citing the requirement of further regulatory oversight. This, coupled with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s lawsuit against Binance, signals significant regulatory headwinds ahead for the crypto industry. But as the U.S. dollar slides amid Fed\u2019s easing monetary stance and macroeconomic jitters, Bitcoin might hold its position as the best-performing asset in 2023.\n\nSee more on startup investing from Benzinga.\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

        "content": "Famed investor Warren Buffett says Americans should brace for more bank failures \u2014 but they shouldn\u2019t worry about losing their deposits. He also has some (more) unkind things to say about bitcoin.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Buffett weighed in on the recent turmoil in the banking sector, which was sparked by the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last month. While \u201cwe\u2019re not through with bank failures,\u201d the Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO said, \u201cnobody is going to lose money on a deposit in a U.S. bank.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank a few days later, the federal government stepped in to guarantee that all deposits would be protected, even those beyond the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\u2019s usual $250,000 limit.\n\nBuffett\u2019s comments indicate that he believes the government will continue to protect depositors, even if the instability in the banking sector persists. \u201cDumb decisions\u201d made by banks shouldn\u2019t panic \u201cthe whole citizenry of the United States about something they don\u2019t need to be panicked about,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the same can\u2019t be said for investors who own bank stocks \u2014 the government is \u201cnot gonna save the stockholder,\u201d Buffett added.\n\nBuffett says bitcoin investments are like gambling\n\nBuffett also reiterated his stance on bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. \u201cIt\u2019s a gambling token,\u201d he said of bitcoin on CNBC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any value, but that doesn\u2019t stop people from wanting to play a roulette wheel.\u201d\n\nThe acclaimed chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, known for being a brilliant and disciplined long-term investor, has been a steadfast critic of bitcoin and other cryptos. In the past, Buffett has described bitcoin as \"rat poison squared.\"\n\nCryptocurrencies saw a major rally in the first quarter of the year, with bitcoin prices rising more than 80% since January (though prices are still down more than 50% from their all-time highs in 2021). While it\u2019s possible that those gains could continue, experts say rising interest rates and the recent banking crisis could weigh on prices moving forward.\n\nFinancial advisors generally recommend keeping only a very small portion of your portfolio \u2014 5% or even less \u2014 in risky investments like digital currencies, if you do choose to invest. Because of how unpredictable and volatile digital assets can be, you should only invest what you are prepared to lose.\n\nMore from Money:\n\n6 Best Crypto Exchanges of April 2023\n\nBank Failures Explained: Answers to 6 Big Questions About What Happened and What's Next\n\nWhy Stocks Could Fall Again as Companies Start Reporting Earnings"

        "content": "Bitcoin and ether are crypto\u2019s blue chips. And much like tech giants Apple and Microsoft, they\u2019ve attracted distinct and loyal communities, leading to a natural rivalry.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are also increasingly correlated. In fact, they\u2019re moving more in tandem than ever before.\n\nBut BTC is still the market leader. It commands almost half of the entire crypto capitalization, its dominance now at one-year highs. That\u2019s still less than the 2018-2019 bear market, when bitcoin dominance was as high as 71%.\n\nETH meanwhile makes up nearly 20%, more than double what it was when the market bottomed last cycle. Comparing returns since Apr. 2018 shows bitcoin outstripping ether for most of that interim \u2014- until May 2021.\n\nBitcoin was just coming down from reaching $60,000 for the first time, while ether was correcting after attempting to break $4,000. At that point, bitcoin had returned around 550% since the first inning of the previous bear market, going from $7,900 to nearly $51,000. Ether had just eclipsed bitcoin, having jumped more than 700%.\n\nBitcoin and ether are practically even over the past five years\n\nEther would hold onto that lead for practically the entire bull market and then some. Bitcoin has gained ground though, thanks to a falling ETH-to-BTC ratio (down 13.5% over the past year).\n\nBTC is now a whisker away from topping ETH over the past five years \u2014 the former returning 279% to the latter\u2019s 289%.\n\nSimple charts like these suffer from a certain amount of time bias (the five-year returns may look completely different in another three months).\n\nStill, Bob Ras, co-founder of tokenized securities startup Sologenic, explained that the narrative has shifted somewhat when it comes to Bitcoin and Ethereum since the 2021 bull run.\n\n\u201cThere was so much strength behind the Ethereum ecosystem because of all the utility enabled by DeFi, NFTs, ENS and other applications,\u201d Ras told Blockworks.\n\n\u201cDuring the bull run, there were a lot more users around who were toying with various digital asset applications, and so it made sense for Ethereum to have been the key driver of growth.\u201d\n\nThe three-year chart tells a different story: ETH has dominated BTC over the past three years (1,085% to 327%)\n\nBitcoin has performed less bad than ether\n\nThe macro situation has changed since the 2018 bull market, capped off by the recent US banking crisis.\n\nRas noted that the Federal Reserve will have to pivot away from its tightening policy soon, which could inject more liquidity into the market to prevent a credit crunch.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is now rivaling gold and other stores of value when it comes to hedging against these likely forthcoming liquidity injections, which will ultimately contribute to the debasement of the dollar and other fiat currencies,\u201d Ras said.\n\n\u201cBTC is the hardened, reliable asset right now. The narrative could shift again, of course, but it seems likely that the ETH/BTC ratio could trend downwards for some time \u2014 perhaps until the next bull market fully kicks in.\u201d\n\nZooming in to just the past year shows where those \u2018gains\u2019 have been made\n\nBTC has outperformed ETH easily since April 2022, weeks before Terra would depeg, causing chaos for crypto. BTC is down almost 26% while ETH has fallen 37%.\n\nAlthough, it would be more accurate to say bitcoin has performed \u201cless bad,\u201d considering neither have boosted portfolios over the past year.\n\nZooming out to encompass all-time returns however, bitcoin blows ether out of the water.\n\nBitcoin has returned a pearl-clutching 4-billion percent since its earliest recorded price in late 2009 ($0.00076392).\n\nEther has \u201conly\u201d risen 66,544% since it first launched in 2015.

        "title": "US Sells 9800 Bitcoin Seized From Silk Road for $215 Million - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nAfter seizing roughly 50,000 bitcoins from James Zhong in November 2022, the U.S. government has begun selling off these assets, with 9,800 sold most recently.\n\nThis sale, which took place in March 2023, was hardly the first time that the United States government has sold bitcoin seized from what it deems to be criminal operations. In 2014, for example, the federal government sold off roughly 30,000 BTC from the same source as this latest sale: Silk Road, a darknet marketplace that used bitcoin as its medium of exchange and was shut down in 2013. Zhong managed to steal these funds from Silk Road via wire transfer, as detailed in court documents. In light of his age, cooperation with prosecutors and other extenuating circumstances, he was given a relatively light sentence following the confiscation of his bitcoin.\n\nAlthough the government has certainly sold off larger quantities of bitcoin before, the fact that Zhong\u2019s ill-gotten spoils have blossomed from less than $1 million to nearly $1.5 billion in value has complicated matters. The federal government evidently used Coinbase as the platform to conduct these sales, apparently only offloading the first tranche of the hoard and custodying the remainder. The asking price was roughly $2,000 shy per bitcoin of the retail market asking price that day, and the transaction incurred roughly $215,000 in transaction fees. This fact prompted digs from the crypto community, with many noting that far more generous terms could be found on other exchanges. Still, the sale was successful in a sense, and the federal government plans to sell the rest in four batches.\n\nThe origin of these bitcoin is closely related to a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the international crypto community: the plight of Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road\u2019s founder. Silk Road was one of the first major uses of Bitcoin to make international headlines, representing Bitcoin\u2019s humble origins and the libertarian ideologies at the core of the early crypto community. As a darknet market, the Silk Road offered a venue to connect sellers and buyers of various prohibited substances pseudonymously. After the site was shut down, Ulbricht was arrested, and in 2015 given more than a double life sentence without possibility for parole, despite being a first-time, non-violent offender.\n\nUlbricht has reached out to the Bitcoin community from prison, claiming that he\u2019s \u201cspent the last eight years watching Bitcoin grow up from in here.\u201d Citing the community\u2019s courage and potential for innovation, he has stated that, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how things would turn out for Bitcoin back in the beginning, but over the years, I\u2019ve been continually impressed with what you\u2019ve accomplished.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, it is incredible how far Bitcoin has come and that comparatively paltry sums while Ulbricht was free have grown to represent billions of dollars in value. However, the extreme harshness of his sentencing is a reminder that institutions of government and finance have been overwhelmingly hostile to Bitcoin in the past, and any acceptance now is itself a massive accomplishment.\n\nIn short, this particular sale, particularly compared to a larger one in 2014, represents the vast growth that Bitcoin has seen since its early days. Despite all of this progress, however, it is important to remember the humble origins of this international community, and all of those who suffered at the cusp of innovation. The events of Silk Road are still relevant to our thriving world of Bitcoin today, and will continue to be for some time to come.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "The failure of FTX triggered a notable growth of self-custody in 2022, with numerous cryptocurrency investors transitioning from centralized exchanges (CEX) to hardware or software wallets.\n\nThe rising popularity of self-custody could even potentially erase the need for centralized exchanges one day, according to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. But how would people buy or sell cryptocurrencies without centralized exchanges?\n\nThe crypto industry already offers ways to exchange cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) for fiat money without using a CEX like Binance. However, such a process is associated with certain pros and cons and may require additional research.\n\nThis article will discuss the most straightforward exchange methods to shed some light on buying or selling crypto without using a centralized crypto trading platform.\n\nBitcoin ATMs\n\nBitcoin-enabled automated teller machines (ATMs) are probably one of the easiest ways to exchange fiat money for crypto and vice versa. Like conventional ATMs, Bitcoin ATMs allow users to deposit and withdraw money using cash or a debit card. But instead of a bank account, a Bitcoin ATM requires users to have a BTC wallet address to deposit or withdraw money.\n\nLike a traditional ATM, a Bitcoin ATM has a monitor, a QR scanner, a bill acceptor and a dispenser. To connect their Bitcoin wallet to a crypto ATM, users are usually prompted to scan a QR code corresponding to their BTC wallet address.\n\nWhile providing a simple way to exchange money against cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin ATMs suffer from limited global adoption.\n\nAccording to data from CoinATMRadar, there are roughly 34,000 Bitcoin ATMs in 80 countries worldwide, with almost 85% of all crypto ATMs in the United States. About 4% of Bitcoin ATMs are located across Europe, with most of those located in Spain, Poland, Romania, Switzerland and Austria.\n\nThe infrastructure of global cryptocurrency ATMs has also seen a significant decline recently. According to data from CoinATMRadar, 412 crypto ATMs were removed from the grid worldwide in the first two months of 2023, compared with 1,000 monthly crypto ATM installations between December 2020 and January 2022.\n\nGiven the limited reach of crypto ATMs, one shouldn\u2019t rely entirely on their capability to exchange fiat for crypto. According to some industry executives, crypto ATMs have also been increasingly scrutinized by regulators recently, which could bring even more issues to the exchange method.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, ATMs provided an excellent service to anyone looking to buy and sell Bitcoin privately,\u201d Trezor\u2019s Bitcoin analyst Josef Tetek told Cointelegraph. \u201cCurrent global trends suggest that this era is coming to its end, as ATM providers are becoming regulated just like any other financial institution,\u201d he noted, suggesting that Bitcoin ATMs are likely to become significantly less private in the near future.\n\nAnother weak spot of Bitcoin ATMs is high transaction costs, with fees often ranging from 5\u201320%.\n\nPeer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange platforms\n\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin exchange marketplaces are among the most common crypto exchange options alongside Bitcoin ATMs. Such platforms allow users to trade digital currency directly with each other without the need for a centralized third party to facilitate the transactions.\n\nUnlike CEXs, P2P exchanges don\u2019t rely on automated engines to complete transactions, allowing users to manually choose their preferred offer, trade directly with a counterparty, and transact funds using a self-custodial wallet. Such platforms are less vulnerable than CEXs due to their independence from intermediaries controlling funds during a trade.\n\nMany industry executives believe that P2P crypto marketplaces are likely to be the future of crypto due to their unique features. \u201cP2P exchanges are far more resilient to regulatory crackdowns than centralized exchanges,\u201d Jan3 CEO Samson Mow told Cointelegraph, adding that it would be good to have more P2P options.\n\n\u201cP2P services are the future of Bitcoin adoption, but only if they can successfully avoid intruding on users\u2019 privacy,\u201d Trezor\u2019s Tetek said. He specified that some regulatory restrictions, like Know Your Customer (KYC), could essentially make P2P crypto services useless, stating:\n\n\u201cHaving a P2P service with KYC is merely a variation of using a CEX but with worse liquidity.\u201d\n\nWhile providing a more resilient option on the regulatory side, P2P services are often associated with security issues, according to Quantum Economics founder and CEO Mati Greenspan. P2P exchanges like Binance P2P or now-terminated Paxful and LocalBitcoins are \u201ccertainly a step in the right direction,\u201d he said, adding:\n\n\u201cThis sort of online marketplace maintains the decentralized ethos of crypto, but it is also susceptible to attacks from both regulators and hackers.\u201d\n\nCrypto on-ramp/off-ramp integrations on software or hardware wallets\n\nAnother common way to buy or sell crypto without a CEX is using an on-ramp or an off-ramp solution provided within a self-custodial wallet through a third-party payment provider.\n\nSoftware wallets like Exodus and hardware ones \u2014 like Ledger and Trezor \u2014 offer several methods to deposit or withdraw Bitcoin using default software through various payment integrations. Such wallets often allow users to buy crypto or cash out their coins using bank transfers, debit or credit card payments, Apple Pay and other options, depending on the country of the user\u2019s bank location.\n\nProviding a simple alternative to Bitcoin ATM or P2P services, wallet exchange integrations are currently accompanied by issues like limited coverage due to the low adoption of crypto payment partnerships worldwide. Due to this issue, residents of many countries may find it impossible to exchange their crypto against fiat because their banks aren\u2019t supported on the payment provider\u2019s network.\n\nHowever, one may also find that wallet exchange integrations are a bit costly in terms of fees. For example, some third-party application programming interface (API) providers on Exodus Wallet charge up to 12% in automated clearing house transfer fees.\n\nSoftware and hardware wallets are usually integrated with more than just a single off-ramp or on-ramp provider, offering a significant variety of choices. Some providers include PayPal, MoonPay, Transak, Sardine, Banxa, Coinbase Pay, Onramp.money and Mercuryo \u2014 among others.\n\nOffline P2P exchange\n\nOne doesn\u2019t necessarily need to use online exchange services to buy or sell Bitcoin. There is an opportunity to do that in person or by interacting with investors who want to cash out or acquire some cryptocurrency on social media apps.\n\n\u201cVarious alternatives do exist for offline transactions where the buyer meets the seller in person. Depending where you live, this might happen at a regular currency exchange shop or through a known black market dealer,\u201d Greenspan told Cointelegraph. He referred to groups on messengers like Telegram or WhatsApp, where buyers and sellers are constantly making connections. \u201cI\u2019ve even heard of people using sites like Craigslist,\u201d the exec added.\n\nOffline P2P exchange of Bitcoin is the \u201cbest choice for privacy-minded individuals,\u201d Trezor\u2019s BTC analyst Tetek believes. He stressed that exchanging Bitcoin in person is essentially returning to the roots of BTC exchange. \u201cBitcoin meetups are usually the best place to find fellow Bitcoiners looking for an exchange,\u201d he said.\n\nAs everything has pros and cons, offline P2P exchange isn\u2019t unique, and some massive concerns are associated with such a Bitcoin exchange method.\n\nThe biggest risks of offline P2P exchange are related to safety and limited scalability, Quantum Economics\u2019 Greenspan said, adding:\n\n\u201cThere are loads of disadvantages from safety concerns to the uncomfortable feeling of dealing with a complete stranger, but mostly it\u2019s just not a very scalable solution.\u201d\n\nSuch a crypto exchange method also requires users to be much more knowledgeable and savvy than just purchasing online at a well-known crypto exchange.\n\nCan you buy Bitcoin on a DEX?\n\nWhile considering options for buying or selling Bitcoin without interacting with a CEX, one may consider using a decentralized exchange (DEX) as an alternative. But should a DEX count as a standalone option to a CEX in this regard?\n\nDespite offering the opportunity to buy or sell Bitcoin, DEXs usually require users to have some exposure to crypto before the transaction. That means that Bitcoin can only be purchased or withdrawn with the help of other cryptocurrencies on a DEX.\n\nAdditionally, some issues currently prevent DEXs from serving as a solid alternative to CEXs in terms of buying or selling crypto, according to Trezor\u2019s Tetek. \u201cSome of the major challenges include unfriendly user experience, high spreads resulting from low liquidity, and concerns about receiving \u2018dirty\u2019 Bitcoin or fiat,\u201d he said. The analyst added that these issues must be addressed for further adoption of DEXs.\n\nIt also depends on what one refers to as a DEX, Jan3\u2019s Mow added. \u201cIf you\u2019re referring to an Ethereum-based DEX, it\u2019s not an alternative at all because, at the base layer, Ethereum isn\u2019t decentralized,\u201d the executive argued, adding that a real DEX won\u2019t have any centralized part that can be shut down.\n\nIs there a future without centralized crypto exchanges?\n\nDespite the industry offering many decentralized options to exchange Bitcoin against fiat, CEXs remain a significant player.\n\nApart from offering a straightforward entry into the crypto market and Web3, CEXs are also an important industry component in terms of price discovery, according to Bitcoin proponent Mow. He stated:\n\n\u201cCentralized cryptocurrency exchanges will always continue to exist, and they are an important venue for price discovery and liquidity. Only regions that endorse a heavy-handed approach will force exchanges out, but that\u2019s really to the detriment of their people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s yet to be known whether CEXs will continue to be a key part of the crypto industry in the coming years. Some experts are confident that the industry will get rid of centralized exchanges one day.\n\n\u201cFor now, centralized exchanges remain a necessary scourge on the industry, and I do look forward to the day we can do without them entirely,\u201d Quantum Economics CEO Greenspan said.\n\n\u201cCentralized exchanges pose a risk not only to the privacy and security of Bitcoin users but also undermine the very reason Bitcoin came into existence \u2014 creating a parallel financial system and supporting the financial autonomy of its holders,\u201d Trezor\u2019s Tetek stated. He added that CEXs undeniably served as an accelerator for Bitcoin adoption in the past, but they are slowly becoming its \u201cbiggest enemy.\u201d The BTC analyst added:\n\n\u201cI can definitely imagine a world without any CEXs. When Bitcoin becomes a global monetary standard, there will be no need to exchange Bitcoin for fiat.\u201d\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "UK forms Bitcoin Policy org to boost BTC education and adoption - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "God save our gracious coin, and long live the coin. A team of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and Bitcoin (BTC) advocates have assembled to back Bitcoin in Britain.\n\nBitcoin Policy UK (BPUK) unites stakeholders, policymakers, environmentalists, tax specialists, Bitcoin experts and miners to \u201cunlock the potential of Bitcoin\u201d in Britain and explore how the decentralized currency\u2019s burgeoning industry could benefit U.K. households, businesses and communities.\n\nBPUK\u2019s primary objectives are to drive investment, generate and prepare students for the Bitcoin jobs of the future, raise awareness and education, and explore the use of wasted and stranded energy resources for Bitcoin mining.\n\nFreddie New, BPUK\u2019s head of policy, told Cointelegraph that \u201cthe genesis of this project was the Bitcoin Collective Conference in Edinburgh\u201d \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s largest Bitcoin conference, taking place in fall 2022.\n\nBitcoin advocates Natalie Brunell, Lawrence Lepard, Greg Foss and Jeff Booth on stage at the Bitcoin Collective in 2022. Source: Bitcoin Collective\n\nNew told Cointelegraph that most of the team had been working on Bitcoin advocacy in one way or another before the conference, \u201cbut coming together like this will enable us to formalize these efforts and focus on three key related areas.\u201d He continued:\n\n\u201cGetting clear and correct information on Bitcoin to policymakers and regulators, highlighting the environmental and sustainability benefits of the mining industry, and collating and providing educational resources for the next generation of Bitcoiners.\u201d\n\nSome of the advisers and board members are familiar to Cointelegraph readers. Author and journalist DecentraSuze, whose son recently introduced Bitcoin to the classroom, is a director, while Jordan Walker, co-founder of The Bitcoin Collective, and Mark Morton are advisers. Morton\u2019s Bitcoin mining company, Scilling Digital Mining, was featured in a recent Cointelegraph mini-documentary:\n\nWalker told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is an important piece of the collective puzzle to drive Bitcoin education in the U.K.:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the UK to step up when it comes to embracing new technologies such as Bitcoin, otherwise we risk getting left behind.\u201d\n\nNew told Cointelegraph that the BPUK is not-for-profit. To operate, it hopes to raise funds through the community, tapping into the growing trend of funding projects with satoshis, or small amounts of BTC, via the Lightning Network, a layer-2 instant payment solution built atop Bitcoin.\n\nPart of the team\u2019s mission is to locate and harness renewable, wasted or stranded energy across the U.K., New explained.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working [\u2026] to identify potential sites for sustainable mining, and our aim is to develop some small mining installations to use as \u2018proof-of-concept\u2019 sites.\n\nHe continued with the plan: \u201cWe can then invite British policymakers to these sites so they can see mines in action and hopefully understand more about the industry\u2019s potential to mitigate vented methane, provide demand response for renewable grids, or simply act as a customer for energy that is otherwise wasted.\u201d\n\nThe bagpiper procession that brought the Bitcoin Collective conference to a close. Source: YouTube\n\nThe U.K. has burgeoning renewable energy sources but lacks in hash rate (a measure of the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s security). According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the U.K. supports 0.23% of the global monthly hash rate, compared with the United States\u2019 37.84%.\n\nThis is partly due to electricity costs in the U.K. exceeding those of the U.S. and Asia, but also due to Bitcoin mining awareness \u2014 or a lack thereof \u2014 in the U.K. Moreover, legacy media platforms have taken aim at the Bitcoin mining industry in recent years \u2014 the Guardian critiqued Bitcoin as \u201cdigital beef\u201d instead of \u201cdigital gold.\u201d\n\nA heat map of the monthly Bitcoin Mining hash rate. The U.K. is light orange, at 0.23%. Source: CCAF\n\nBPUK highlighted that in light of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the European Union, it could develop a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency regime separate from that of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in Europe. The European parliamentary committee on MiCA may threaten Bitcoin mining on the continent.\n\nBPUK co-founder Krista Edmunds took inspiration from El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Edmunds explained:\n\n\u201cThe U.K. has an immense opportunity to become one of the first jurisdictions globally to embrace Bitcoin. We have seen what is possible in El Salvador, which is experiencing huge gains due to its forward-thinking approach to Bitcoin. The U.K. can secure a similar competitive advantage, and we hope to support the British people in making that happen.\u201d\n\nOn the governmental side, the policy group will have an opportunity to educate and inform. Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament and chairperson of the Crypto and Digital Assets All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), told Cointelegraph in an interview last year: \u201cWe are on a learning curve, and it\u2019s just very, very important because the U.K. government has a policy vision that the U.K. will become an international hub of cryptocurrency and digital assets.\u201d She added that there was some confusion surrounding Bitcoin, central bank digital currencies and cryptocurrency.\n\nCointelegraph's Joe Hall speaks to MP Lisa Cameron in Edinburgh.\n\nNew explained that as a Bitcoin-only organization, the BPUK ultimately seeks to \u201cmake sure that Bitcoin is included in the government\u2019s proposals, if not at the front and center.\""

We did not receive windfall payments as reported,\u201d Bitdeer wrote.\n\nBitcoin mining consists of computers performing trillions of calculations every second to find a combination of numbers that Bitcoin accepts. A computer guesses the right number combination approximately every 10 minutes.\n\nMining requires massive amounts of electricity, which has led to large quantities of carbon emissions. Researchers at the University of Cambridge estimate Bitcoin has emitted 200m tonnes of CO2 since it launched.\n\nThe electricity consumption needed for Bitcoin mining can affect residents in the areas mines are settled.\n\nWhere Bitcoin mines exist in West Texas, energy bills have risen 9 per cent. In other areas, bills have risen anywhere from 4 to 5 per cent."

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 April 12, 2023 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC, MicroStrategy MSTR, Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF WGMI, Marathon Digital Holdings MARA, HIVE Blockchain Technologies HIVE and Riot Platforms RIOT.\n\nBitcoin Defies Skeptics, Breaks $30,000\n\nBitcoin Reclaims $30,000\n\nThe road to redemption for the world's oldest and most popular cryptocurrency has been a rough one (to say the least) and has had plenty of skeptics. However, last night, Bitcoin breached the $30,000 mark for the first time since June 2022. Against all odds, BTC is up ~80% year-to-date. Here are a few important things you should know:\n\n\"Buy when there's blood in the streets\": More times than not, the best time to buy a market is when the news is the worst. Indeed, this turned out to be the case for BTC and various BTC proxies such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. In November 2022, doomed crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy (after committing the largest fraud since Madoff's Ponzi scheme), shaking crypto markets. Over that short time, BTC has doubled.\n\nSafe Haven Asset: For months in 2022, Bitcoin was closely correlated to equities, specifically tech, and the Nasdaq. However, in the past few months, Bitcoin has been trading more in sync with gold. Finally, it appears that \"Bitcoin Maximalists\" that believe BTC is a safe haven asset and not just a \"yolo\" product of easy money central bank policies have something to hang their hats on.\n\nBitcoin Behemoth Back Onside: In 2020, MicroStrategy, a public software company in business since the late 1990s, took the bold and unorthodox step to move to the \"Bitcoin Standard\". Led by its outspoken and eccentric founder Michael Saylor, MSTR has purchased nearly $4 billion worth of Bitcoin, which translates to roughly 130,000 BTC! In a show of conviction or unfounded confidence (you decide), Saylor and MSTR have dollar cost averaged into BTC the entire way down is finally back to their cost basis of around $30,000 per coin.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin Halving Slated for Early 2024: Roughly one year from now, Bitcoin will experience its next \"Halving.\" Bitcoin halvings occur every four years and refers to when the reward for Bitcoin miners (network validators) is cut in half. Each halving event means that the number of new Bitcoin being let out into circulation is slashed in half. Remember, unlike central bank currencies, Bitcoin is finite \u2013 there will only ever be 21 million in existence. Past halving events have led to dramatic bull markets in BTC's price.\n\nMiners are on Fire: Year-to-date, the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF is up 97%, making it one of the top-performing ETFs in the entire market. The ETF's top three holdings include Marathon Digital Holdings, HIVE Blockchain Technologies and Riot Platforms.\n\nLong-Term Technical Picture is Improving: While it is hard to chase Bitcoin into a large round number like $30,000 after a rapid short-term move, BTC and BTC proxies like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust are showing improving longer-term technical. GBTC just triggered a bullish golden cross \u2013 a bullish technical signal that occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses over the 200-day from below. While the signal failed the last time, when it happened in 2020, GBTC shot higher from $10 to $60 in rapid order fashion.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "'Bitcoin is a gambling token, and it doesn't have any intrinsic value' \u2014 Warren Buffett - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Warren Buffett once again took up his familiar role as conductor of the FUD train in yet another anti-cryptocurrency interview with CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box on April 12.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had an explosion of gambling,\u201d the magnate told CNBC by way of describing the cryptocurrency market. He then added, \u201cI like to bet on a football game if I\u2019m sitting and watching \u2014 it makes it more interesting. But I don\u2019t think I want to make a living trying to bet against the house.\u201d\n\nThis represents somewhat of a softening of Buffett\u2019s historical stance on Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency. Over the years, he\u2019s made a habit of down-talking crypto, with some of his most controversial quotes coming from previous CNBC interviews.\n\n\"People like to play the lottery,\" says Warren Buffett on the crypto craze. \"It's appealing to the gambling instinct. We've had an explosion of gambling.\" pic.twitter.com/pjNEKdNgr1 \u2014 Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) April 12, 2023\n\nIn a 2014 Squawk Box interview, he told Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert that Bitcoin was \u201ca mirage\u201d and claimed that \u201cthe idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke.\u201d\n\nBuffett ventured speculation on Bitcoin\u2019s longevity in another 2014 CNBC interview, stating that he \u201cwould not be surprised if Bitcoin is not around in 10 or 20 years.\u201d At the time, he also said Bitcoin couldn\u2019t be considered a currency because it is \u201cinevitably based on the value of the dollar.\u201d\n\nRelated: Buffett back bashing Bitcoin, claims it \u2018doesn\u2019t produce anything\u2019\n\nWhat\u2019s perhaps Buffett\u2019s most famous quote on cryptocurrency came in a January 2018 interview when he doubled down on fellow Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger\u2019s previous assertion that Bitcoin was \u201crat poison\u201d by saying that it was \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d\n\nThat brings us to his most recent CNBC interview, where Buffett\u2019s tone appears to have changed somewhat.\n\nWhen asked when Bitcoin will be \u201crevealed as not just rat poison squared [...] But when it will be unveiled as not a thing,\u201d Buffett shrugged off the question and instead compared the cryptocurrency to gambling:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s predicting when speculation will end or when the gambling instinct will go away.\u201d\n\nThe billionaire then shifted his response to a brief riff on snail mail chain letters, \u201cI didn\u2019t like chain letters when I was a kid. I thought, \u2018Why in the world would I send along a chain letter\u2026 when I could start my own?\u2019\u201d\n\nBuffett eventually came back around to his gambling analogy, claiming that Bitcoin users were essentially placing bets with their income: \u201cYou had millions of people that were getting checks and the money and sitting home and finding out that they could have a roulette wheel in their house.\u201d\n\n\"#Bitcoin is a gambling token and it doesn't have any intrinsic value. But that doesn't stop people from wanting to play the roulette wheel,\" says Warren Buffett on #crypto. pic.twitter.com/6MQAiyrS5J \u2014 Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) April 12, 2023\n\nThe billionaire\u2019s track record in business may be long and storied, but Buffett\u2019s own Berkshire Hathaway investment group hasn\u2019t been immune to losses related to the recent banking crisis.\n\nAs Cointelegraph\u2019s Marcel Pechman wrote in March, \u201cBitcoin\u2019s price increased by 31.5% in the six months preceding March 17, while Berkshire\u2019s stock increased by 5.8%. So, for the time being, the so-called \u2018rat poison\u2019\u2026 is outpacing his own financial management firm.\u201d"

        "content": "Eric Wall is a researcher and investor, and in this interview, we discuss how Eric became a notable critical voice within the HEX community, his ongoing fight with prominent Bitcoin maximalists, and Taproot Wizards.\n\n- - - -\n\nWhat Bitcoin stands for and should be is a debate that has been raging since 2009. Bitcoin\u2019s unique characteristics have drawn many people into its gravity. The realisation that its immaculate conception may never be replicated has resulted in many of those same people guarding Bitcoin\u2019s development with uncompromising zeal.\n\nThe result has been the rise of Bitcoin Maximalism. Maximalist ideology can be a fuzzy concept: there are no clearly agreed rules or principles; there have been various iterations with different priorities over time. However, it is clearly characterised by conservatism over the development of the protocol, and intolerance for those with differing attitudes.\n\nNevertheless, that is not to say that Bitcoin development can forever remain in stasis. There are and have been pressures requiring upgrades both to the base layer, and in the development of additional layers. This means there is always a creative tension on what changes are required, and how quickly these need to be implemented.\n\nFurther, as Bitcoin has no leader, it has engendered an ecosystem where advocates organically emerge, who can gain traction and have an outsized influence on the community. This creates further tensions as Bitcoin\u2019s purpose is being proselytized using competing and sometimes muddied beliefs.\n\nThus, it is important that Bitcoiners enable an open dialogue where all ideas are questioned, scrutinized and tested. And such debates should be open to all Bitcoiners, without fear or favour to any powerful interests. Is the question therefore how intolerant we should be of those with differing views? And, can we live without trolling, or is this a necessary defensive tool?"

        "content": "Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong owes me $100. That\u2019s because he might not know how to use the Lightning Network, the instant payment solution built on top of Bitcoin.\n\nArmstrong, who\u2019s been building in the Bitcoin (BTC) space since 2012, recently tweeted that he would pay people who provided the \u201cbest examples\u201d of people using cryptocurrency in Africa. \u201cIf you\u2019re using crypto in Africa, reply with a short video (<30 seconds) or photo of how you\u2019re using it,\u201d Armstrong wrote. \u201cBest few examples get $100 in crypto.\u201d\n\nIf you're using crypto in Africa, reply with a short video (<30 seconds) or photo of how you're using it. Best few examples get $100 in crypto. Use hashtag #CryptoAfrica\n\n\n\nAnd if you haven't already, try out self-custodial Coinbase Wallet - send feedback https://t.co/zWvaH1nerF \u2014 Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) April 7, 2023\n\nThis is the CEO of Coinbase, after all, so I shared a video of myself using Bitcoin in Africa, which was part of a 30-second segment of a recent Cointelegraph documentary covering Bitcoin in Senegal.\n\nThe tweet quickly became the most-liked and most-shared response to Armstrong\u2019s query. (Crucially, the tweet referred to Bitcoin in Africa, not crypto in Africa, and it demonstrated the ease and speed of the Lightning Network.)\n\nHowever, Armstrong appears to have ignored my submission, despite more than 600 likes and 100 retweets. The next most popular submission had just 50 likes. So, I reached out to some key opinion leaders, creators and influencers within the Bitcoin community to amplify the tweet. Wicked, an anonymous Bitcoin educator and data analyst, tagged Armstrong in a post, accusing him of \u201cactively ignoring the #Bitcoin Lightning Network.\u201d\n\nMy tweets auto-delete after some number of months, so there is no search history.\n\n\n\nLightning is great and something we\u2019ll integrate. \u2014 Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) April 8, 2023\n\nWicked very kindly drew Brian\u2019s attention to my tweet video about Bitcoin in Africa. The tweet, and Armstrong's affirmation that \"Lightning is great and something we'll integrate,\" led to news outlets around the world reporting on Coinbase's next development. He then also tweeted that he had sent me the money.\n\nAwesome! sent $100 to joe@coincorner.io\n\n\n\ncheers \u2014 Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) April 8, 2023\n\nHere\u2019s where things get weird. Armstrong said he paid me the $100. He said he sent $100 to the Lightning address shown in my Twitter profile bio: Joe@Coincorner.io\n\nNow, if you\u2019ve never used the Lightning Network before, you\u2019d be forgiven for confusing this address with an email address. But would the CEO of Coinbase make that mistake? Could the Bitcoin OG have failed to recognize that the request in my bio \u2014 which says \u201cSend BTC to Joe@Coincorner.io,\u201d surrounded by lightning bolt emojis \u2014 could be my Lightning address?\n\nSide note: Running a Bitcoin node is mildly technical, and sending money on the Bitcoin blockchain for the first time is a little nerve-wracking, as the transaction takes roughly 10 minutes to confirm and we live in an instant world. But using the Lightning Network in 2023? It\u2019s brain-dead easy. A walk in the park. Seriously.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big call, Joe,\u201d I hear you say.\n\nYep, it is. And I\u2019ve got the receipts to prove it. It\u2019s so easy to use the Lightning Network that I stand in the street in locations worldwide giving out Bitcoin to people on their brand-new Lightning wallets \u2014 and I film their reactions.\n\nThe most common remarks are \u201cI didn\u2019t know it\u2019s so easy\u201d and \u201cWow, it\u2019s so fast.\u201d The videos are on my YouTube channel. Here\u2019s a video shot in France for the Cointelegraph YouTube channel where I give out Bitcoin:\n\nSo, please \u2014 let\u2019s not pretend that Armstrong is overwhelmed by the complexity of sending money to my Lightning address. Moreover, funnily enough, Bitcoin advocates worldwide saw my tweet and took pleasure in sending me sats to show that my Lightning address is alive and well.\n\nMy phone blowing up with payment notifications.\n\nBack to the story. Danny Scott, CEO of CoinCorner \u2014 a Bitcoin and Lightning company \u2014 was quick to point out to Armstrong on Twitter that he might have made a mistake in confusing Bitcoin and email, as Coinbase provides a \u201csend to email\u201d function.\n\nRelated: Ethereum's Shanghai fork is coming, but it doesn\u2019t mean investors should dump ETH\n\nScott told Cointelegraph in an email, \u201cObviously, we know the address [that Joe shared] is a Lightning address, but clearly not everybody does.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo my guess is Brian knows very little about Lightning right now, in particular LNURL, Lightning addresses and other innovations being built out, which is perfectly fine, he's distracted, it happens, now we just hope he helps himself and the industry by turning their attention to what really has substance and long term value, Bitcoin and Lightning.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true: Coinbase offers trading for more than 250 different cryptocurrencies \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of tokens to keep one\u2019s eye on. And as Scott adds, \u201cI can appreciate how busy he will be \u2014 this industry doesn\u2019t sleep, and running a Bitcoin company myself, I know that feeling even at a smaller scale.\u201d\n\nTo give Brian and ultimately Coinbase the benefit of the doubt, I waited a few days before writing this article. I have tweeted repeatedly at Brian (no reply) and I also reached out to the Coinbase Press Team. They told me that they would get to the bottom of it, but \u201cMy guess is that Brian is likely batching the sends at certain times.\" A day has passed since this message (more doubt-benefit-giving) and they\u2019ve not sent an explanation.\n\nRelated: Coinbase wins $470K restitution in insider trading case\n\nThe press team email was particularly left-field as it referred to \u201cbatching.\u201d Batching is consolidating multiple payments into a single transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, not the layer-2 Lightning Network. Again, they\u2019re not familiar with Lightning. This adds further insult to injury: Could it be that the Lightning Network simply isn\u2019t on Coinbase\u2019s radar?\n\nIt\u2019s been three days since Armstrong said he would send the money, and there have been some simply wonderful memes from the Bitcoin and wider crypto community.\n\nBrian the \"LN Maxi\" trying to blend in. Source: @Corndalorian\n\nArmstrong has been active on Twitter, while his company is busy launching new projects and winning insider trading cases for the over 250-plus crypto projects Coinbase hosts.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m still waiting for my $100. But I\u2019m also increasingly alarmed that the billionaire, crypto OG and Coinbase CEO Armstrong struggled to spot a Lightning address.\n\nJoe Hall joined Cointelegraph as a reporter in 2021.

        "content": "Our weekly roundup of news from East Asia curates the industry\u2019s most important developments.\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s day of glory on Chinese TikTok\n\nOn Apr. 10, Douyin, the version of Tiktok exclusive to Chinese users, began publishing price quotes related to Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Ripple (XRP). The move sparked rampant speculation among the Chinese media and users alike related to a potential change of policy by the country\u2019s central government on cryptocurrency regulation.\n\nUnlike its Western counterpart, content on Douyin is heavily monitored and sometimes censored by Chinese authorities. Since Sept. 2022, Douyin has been cracking down on content relating to cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and Metaverse.\n\n\n\nAlso read: Why join a blockchain gaming guild? Fun, profit and create better games\n\nHence, many individuals were genuinely surprised to see cryptocurrencies discoverable on the government-curated platform. For around 24-hours, any of Douyin\u2019s estimated 730 million mainland Chinese users could freely view crypto price quotes on the app. However, dreams of a relaxation in the country\u2019s strict crypto laws were crushed shortly thereafter. On Apr. 11, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies price quotes were removed from Douyin, with a message stating:\n\n\u201cBased on relevant national regulations, unofficial digital currencies do not possess the same legal standing as fiat currencies. Please invest cautiously.\u201d\n\nSince 2021, China has banned all forms of crypto exchanges, crypto-fiat transactions brokered by financial institutions, and initial coin offerings. That said, the country stopped short of banning the ownership of cryptocurrencies altogether and the Chinese controlled territory of Hong Kong has unveiled plans to become a crypto hub.\n\nBitcoin on Douyin before and after the crackdown. (GamerSky)\n\nBruce Lee lives again via NFTs\n\nOn Apr. 12, the Bruce Lee Foundation announced it would partner with NFT video platform Shibuya to launch a collection of genesis NFTs featuring the late legendary martial arts actor, who died in 1973 at the age of 32 under mysterious circumstances. The House of Lee collection is one sale on Manifold from Apr. 12 to Apr. 14 and is minted on the Ethereum network, with digital image storage on Arweave.\n\nThe Bruce Lee Genesis NFT (Arweave)\n\nThere is no limit to the number of NFTs minted during the sale. At the time of publication, over 19,592 House of Lee digital collectibles have been minted with a current floor price of around 0.008 Ether. The Bruce Lee NFT was drawn by artists Maciej Kuciara and Emily Yang, with its design inspired by Shannon Lee, daughter of Bruce Lee and president of the Bruce Lee Estate.

Researchers cited the Sept. 2021 People\u2019s Bank of China ban on crypto-fiat transactions as \u201cthe nail in the coffin\u201d for the industry in China.\n\nChina\u2019s crypto user count has dwindled but still thriving (Foresight Ventures)\n\nThat said, the report also noted Hong Kong is becoming a rising hub of blockchain technology in Asia. In Feb. 2023, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) proposed a pathway for exchanges to obtain regulatory licenses through fulfilling the custody, know-your-customer, record-keeping, and risk management requirements. The policy is scheduled to come into effect on June 1, 2023.\n\nInterestingly, Foresight wrote that despite tailwinds from a spending campaign during the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, only 13.61 billion of China\u2019s digital yuan central bank digital currency (CBDC) were in circulation, representing just 0.13% of China\u2019s M0 or outstanding monetary supply. \u201cTrade settlement applications are still in development and are only accepted by very limited partners,\u201d the firm noted.\n\nDespite headwinds, three major venture capital firms, Hashkey Capital, Dragonfly, and Foresight Ventures, are still active in the mainland China region. Notable projects tracing their origins from China include Conflux, Alchemy Pay, Animoca Brands, and CertiK.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s rising Web3 power\n\nThe Hong Kong Web 3.0 Festival gallery hall (Twitter)\n\nOn Apr. 12, more than 10,000 crypto enthusiasts and 300 guest speakers gathered in Hong Kong for the special administrative region\u2019s annual Web3 Festival. During its debut, Lee Ka-Chiu, chief executive of Hong Kong, pledged to allocate 700 million Hong Kong dollars ($89.17 million) from this year\u2019s budget to accelerate the development of digital assets and Web3 technologies in the region. Chan Mo-Po, the financial secretary of Hong Kong, also commented:\n\n\u201cWeb3 is in its infancy, and the current common applications include cryptocurrency, decentralized exchanges, digital identity verification, DeFi, blockchain games, and even NFT but it is conceivable that in the future there will be many more new applications and opportunities. From a historical point of view, the development of Web3 will grow rapidly again after going through the shock stage.\u201d\n\nJustin Sun\u2019s dream rendezvous with socialite overshadowed by legal woes\n\nFor Justin Sun, founder of Tron and de facto owner of cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global, the 2023 Hong Kong Web3 Festival appears to be the pinnacle of his blockchain career. First off, before his arrival, Sun claims to have successfully turned around Huobi\u2019s operations after years of stagnation, posting an impressive profit of $30 million in Q1 2023.\n\nThen, with an aura of awe, the blockchain personality dispelled rumors that he was arrested in Hong Kong on arrival. In 2019, Sun allegedly hired a smuggler to help him bypass mainland China\u2019s border controls and escape the country. This has been linked to exit restrictions due to his involvement in the initial coin offering (ICO) of Tron, which took place days before China banned ICOs. Sun has been out of mainland China ever since. Interestingly, no extradition agreement exists between China and Hong Kong, after a bill for such measure was quashed by a pro-democracy student uprising in 2019. The protests, in turn, were quashed by China\u2019s central government.\n\nThanks to the sacrifice of the students, Sun was able to land in Hong Kong safely and meet face-to-face with Nina, an iPollo community ambassador whom Sun wants to feature in a Huobi beauty pageant and \u201c[personally] guarantee as a final contestant in the Top 20.\u201d Unfortunately, not everyone appears to be dazzled by Sun\u2019s attempt at flirtation. As Sun\u2019s euphoria reached its peak whilst partying onboard a Binance yacht, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a subpoena for Sun on Apr. 12, kindly reminding him of his obligation to appear in court on charges of fraud and securities law violations.\n\n\u201cIf you fail to respond, judgment by default will be entered against you for the relief demanded in the complaint. You also must file your answer or motion with the court.\u201d\n\nThe SEC complaint, filed on Mar. 26, alleges Sun and his companies, Tron and BitTorrent, \u201cfraudulently\u201d manipulated the secondary market for Tron tokens through \u201cextensive wash trading,\u201d conducting more than 600,000 such trades, and also paid numerous American celebrities to promote TRX and BitTorrent (BTT) tokens with zero disclosure.\n\n\n\nSun has since stated that the SEC complaint \u201clacks merit\u201d and that the regulatory body is \u201cstill in its infancy and is in need of further development\u201d with regards to digital assets. The lawsuit is ongoing. Around the same day of the subpoena, Binance.US announced that it would be delisting TRX from its platform.\n\nJustin Sun blushes as he shares a stage with Nina on Apr. 11, oblivious to the looming legal threat that will materialize the day after.

        "content": "Gamers in Africa can now send and receive small amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) while playing classic titles like Counter-Strike.\n\nZebedee, a fintech and payments processor targeting the gaming space, has partnered with crypto exchange platform Bitnob to offer payments and gaming reward options in Africa using the Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN).\n\nWithin the partnership, African users can earn Bitcoin through Zebedee-powered apps and games. Zebedee\u2019s offering serves as a second layer in games that allows developers to replace vague in-game points rewards with satoshis, the smallest denomination of Bitcoin. Through the partnership with Bitnob, these, in turn, can be converted to a local currency like the Nigerian nairas.\n\nRelated: Polygon becomes second-largest gaming blockchain after user activity surges in March\n\nZebedee\u2019s chief strategy officer Ben Cousens explained that the partnership was driven by game developers who had Bitcoin in mind for tournaments and other gaming rewards.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m Activision Blizzard or EA Games and I have 30 million players of my games in Africa, and I run tournaments or giveaways, I cannot pay those players on fiat rails \u2014 it is too expensive. I am limited to the U.S., and I lose money from loss of engagement. Try sending $0.01 to these territories on another rail,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is about the $180 billion video games market, not play-and-earn or crypto gaming.\u201d\n\nIn general, Africa has been a growing area of interest for the Lightning Network, partly due to the LN\u2019s ability to facilitate microtransactions. Bitcoin Senegal founder Nourou told Cointelegraph, \u201cMicrotransactions are our economic reality,\u201d hence why he and many other African builders and developers are exploring the LN.\n\nGamers can already earn Bitcoin by playing popular games such as Counter-Strike. Source: Zebedee\n\nAfrica benefits from young demographics and a digitally native population. Cousens continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen consistent evidence of high demand for our platform across the African continent, where the purchasing power of Bitcoin is considerably higher than markets like the U.S. and Europe.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the matchup of LN and gaming is a growing trend during the bear market. Cousens said it\u2019s \u201cA natural evolution of the interactive entertainment landscape, where \u2018Rewarded Play\u2019 (in lieu of unsustainable play-and-earn) provides meaningful performance uplift for game developers against a backdrop of slowing growth in mobile gaming revenue while engaging players in a fun and creative way.\u201d\n\nMagazine: ZK-rollups are \u2018the endgame\u2019 for scaling blockchains: Polygon Miden founder"

        "content": "A Pew Research Center report noted that most Americans\u2019 confidence in the safety and reliability of cryptocurrency is low, but nonetheless, bitcoin continues to recover from last year\u2019s bear market, pushing past the $30,000 price mark most recently.\n\nBullish investors in the leading cryptocurrency are betting that the U.S. Federal Reserve will start loosening monetary policy as it looks to get inflation under control. Additionally, alternative assets like bitcoin are seeing more interest, especially after the recent bank rescues lower confidence in the stability of the financial system.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is by far doing the best out of the top 20 biggest digital assets. This may be in part because traders are expecting Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to slow the rate of interest rates due to the banking crisis, in turn make \u2018risky\u2019 assets like Bitcoin more appealing,\u201d a Decrypt article said.\n\nAlternative assets are also attracting more investors as the economy continues to flash signs of a recession. Bond markets are doing just that as more investors start to pile into safe haven assets, including bitcoin \u2014 this could re-establish bitcoin\u2019s moniker as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cOthers are pushing the safe haven narrative: with current financial uncertainty, assets like Bitcoin and gold remain a safe bet when a recession is (still) apparently looming,\u201d the article added.\n\nMost Americans Not Confident in Crypto\n\nDespite the recent push for bitcoin, it will still take some time for investors to allocate more capital into the cryptocurrency space. After an exponential rise in 2021, 2022\u2019s bear market not only came with price declines, but also regulatory challenges \u2014 as such, bitcoin and other digital currencies may have lost investors and moreover, are having a hard time offering peace of mind to potential investors.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency markets are taking hits from all sides \u2014 from declines in value to multiple corporate bankruptcies to lawsuits and regulatory threats ,\u201d a Pew Research Center blog noted. \u201cAmong the vast majority of Americans who say they have heard at least a little about cryptocurrency (88%), three-quarters say they are not confident that current ways to invest in, trade or use cryptocurrencies are reliable and safe, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted March 13-19. This comes out to about two-thirds of all U.S. adults.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, in order for a market to mature, it must undergo such challenges. If digital currencies can exit the current market doldrums relatively unscathed, it could potentially re-attract investors again\u2014Bitcoin is up almost 80% for the year, which could certainly help its case."

        "content": "In its roughly 14 years of existence, bitcoin has often drawn comparisons \u2014 launched mainly by proponents \u2014 to gold. There\u2019s the long-running \u201cdigital gold\u201d label, which has often been admonished by gold bugs.\n\nOf course, there are substantial differences between gold and bitcoin, not the least of which being that bullion is something that can be held by the human hand and has a track record which is measured in the thousands of years. However, bitcoin and gold are both considered alternative assets, and the good news for investors is that they don\u2019t necessarily need to choose between the two.\n\nIn what could be a positive sign for equity-based plays on bitcoin, including the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) and the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users and Decentralized Commerce ETF (BLKC), Bernstein said in a recent report to clients that it doesn\u2019t make sense to endorse gold while bashing bitcoin.\n\nThe research firm noted that an increasingly prominent theme in client conversations is that investors are preparing for an extended period of the U.S. dollar falling out of favor, and they\u2019re tapping gold to prepare for that scenario. That makes sense because commodities, including gold, are denominated in dollars, but bitcoin might merit a place in that conversation, too.\n\n\u201cIf you like gold here, you should like bitcoin even more \u2026 Gold and bitcoin correlation increases during the periods of crisis. And when there is a massive monetary debasement event, while both bitcoin and gold rally, bitcoin outperforms gold,\u201d according to Bernstein.\n\nThere might be something to the dollar debasement thesis, as the largest gold-backed exchange traded fund is higher by more than 9% year-to-date. On the other hand, that\u2019s a far cry from the 80% jump notched by bitcoin. That resurgence is propelling BLKC and SATO; the Invesco ETFs are, as of April 10, up 35% and 73.08%, respectively, year-to-date.\n\nSATO\u2019s outpacing of its stablemate is likely attributable to more exposure to bitcoiners \u2014 companies whose share prices are highly correlated to price action in the largest digital currency. BLKC, meanwhile, features some exposure to bitcoin miners as well as significant allocations to traditional financial services companies and large-cap growth stocks.\n\nEither ETF could be a horse worth betting on as bitcoin continues its 2023 ascent. Speaking of horses \u2014 \u201cLiking gold, but not liking bitcoin, is like hating on a faster horse,\u201d concluded Bernstein.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Crypto Channel.\n\nVettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d) is the index provider for BLKC and SATO, for which it receives an index licensing fee.

But according to one trader, choosing where to invest shouldn't come down to picking one over the other.\n\n\"Wolf of All Streets\" podcast host Scott Melker describes Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" and Ethereum as more of a technological investment. \"I think you can love one, love both, and it's totally fine,\" Melker says. \"You don't have to really choose. I think they're separate asset classes and should be viewed as such.\"\n\nBe sure to watch Rachelle Akuffo's full interview with Melker here.\n\nKEY VIDEO MOMENTS:\n\n0:13 Melker's take on Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade.\n\n1:20 Melker breaks down the Bitcoin vs. Ethereum debate\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And I want to talk Ethereum as well, the Shanghai upgrade. Because obviously, we're seeing at least today, Ethereum off to the races here versus Bitcoin. I mean, up about almost 6% on the day. What are your takeaways from that? Obviously, a lot of excitement surrounding this.\n\nSCOTT MELKER: Yeah, there was a bit of a nonsensical narrative that everybody who had staked their Ethereum for the past few years was going to try to withdraw all at once, which you couldn't do anyways, and sell all their Ethereum. But you have to remember that anyone who staked their 30 to Ethereum, which by the way, for most people, was over $60,000. But anyone who staked that 30 to Ethereum had no guarantee they would even be able to withdraw.\n\nThese are the people who are the biggest believers, the maximalists of Ethereum, who really wanted to help secure the network. So now that they're getting the opportunity to withdraw, they're going to continue staking. I think there were more people. And I can speak to this anecdotally from fund managers that I speak to in institutions.\n\nThere are a lot more people who are actually waiting to deposit because they would then know that they would be able to withdraw at some point. So we're actually seeing net inflows over the past 24 hours. It's going back and forth. But there has not been a huge demand for people to withdraw. And there are just as many people putting their money into the contract. I think that this is a huge development for Ethereum. Yet another major step in the right direction for the protocol.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And do you think perhaps investors are more bullish on Ethereum given the use cases versus Bitcoin?\n\nSCOTT MELKER: I view them as completely separate assets. I think that the flipping narrative is completely irrelevant. I view Bitcoin as a digital gold, store of value, flight to safety. And we've obviously seen that, especially, with the banking collapses a few months ago, and Bitcoin rise a few weeks ago. With Bitcoin rising from roughly 19,000 to over $30,000, Ethereum is more of a technological investment. It's a internet of value. And I think that we're starting to see that separation in people's minds. So I think you can love one, love both, and it's totally fine. You don't have to really choose. I think that they're separate asset classes and should be viewed as such."

It expects to start in Q4 2023, subject to regulatory approval. LCH is the world\u2019s largest derivatives clearing house and a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThe derivatives will be cash settled. LCH says it is fully segregating LCH DigitalAssetClear, including a separate default fund.\n\n\u2018Bitcoin index futures and options are a rapidly growing asset class, with increasing interest among institutional market participants looking for access within a regulated environment they are familiar with,\u201d said Frank Soussan, Head of LCH DigitalAssetClear.\n\nCentral clearing houses such as LCH help to mitigate risks by managing collateral and supporting multilateral netting. Ironically, FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried lobbied the U.S. derivatives regulators CFTC, wanting to remove the separation of clearing, enabling it to settle directly and manage collateral internally.\n\nGFO-X has raised \u00a316 million ($20 million) in funding, and the company is controlled by its CEO Arnab Sen and COO Rajesh Melwani, who worked together at Hong Kong\u2019s Harbour Capital Management.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMumbai: Bitcoin 's price has surged past the psychologically significant $30,000 mark for the first time since June 2022, providing a sense of relief to Indian crypto investors who have faced significant losses due to market volatility and several high-profile failures such as that of the Terra ecosystem and the collapse of FTX over the past year.The leading digital currency has surged 6.29% in the past 24 hours to reach $30,160 as of 2300 IST on Coinmarketcap. While it has risen by 72.62% in the last 90 days, it remains down by 23.82% year to date.Bitcoin's price spent several weeks consolidating around the $28,000 mark before recently breaking through, continuing its bull run that began at the start of the New Year.\"It's a big positive for serious Indian crypto investors who are in it for the long haul,\" said Vishal Gupta, a Noida-based crypto investor and influencer.Bitcoin dominates the cryptocurrency market with a $581.9 billion market cap.Experts say that 2023 has been a good year for Bitcoin, and the latest surge to $30,000 is a clear indication of its growing mainstream adoption and investor confidence.\"As we witness this digital asset's ascent, it is important to remember the underlying technology powering it and the potential it holds to reshape our financial future. The potential of VDAs to revolutionise traditional systems is becoming more apparent with each passing day,\" said Sumit Gupta, CEO and founder of Coindcx.The BTC trading volume globally in the last 24 hours stood at $24.16 billion.Gaurav Dahake, founder, BNS, said: \"The rally underscores the growing recognition of bitcoin as a high-quality asset class, akin to gold and silver, particularly during discussions of recession and an uncertain global macroeconomic climate. Investors increasingly perceive Bitcoin as a viable alternative. We anticipate this rally to persist for a few more quarters and remain confident that Bitcoin will surpass the $50,000 milestone within the next six months.\"According to experts, the recent rise in Bitcoin's price is closely linked to expectations of an economic slowdown and subsequent monetary policy loosening by the US Federal Reserve. The anticipation of these economic factors has sparked renewed interest in cryptocurrencies as investors seek alternative assets that may offer greater potential returns.Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, India's second-longest running digital asset exchange, said as Bitcoin's price inched up, some investors might liquidate their positions to book profits, which may result in a healthy pullback.In terms of volume distribution by market pair (24 hours) at leading crypto exchange Wazir X, BTC/INR pair comprised 27.6% of total volume and BTC/USDT was 31.6% at Coindcx, as per Coingecko.According to analysts, the recent rise in Bitcoin is a clear indication of the growing interest in decentralised finance, particularly in the context of the current banking crisis.\"The latest Bitcoin rally is expected to uplift the sentiments of the crypto community across the globe, and the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, which is scheduled to go live tomorrow, is adding to the euphoria around digital assets. As we approach the Bitcoin halving, which is due in May 2024, we can expect the BTC price to rise further,\" said Om Malviya, President, Tezos India, a blockchain adoption entity."

        "title": "Resurgence of Bitcoin: Cryptocurrency Hits Over $30,000 For the First Time Since 2022 - Entrepreneur",
        "content": "Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nYou're reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.\n\nIt seems major cryptocurrency Bitcoin is making a comeback. On 11th April, 2023, the cryptocurrency crossed $30,000 for the first time since 2022. It is a gain of nearly a whopping 80% since the start of the year. Of which, 23% was registered in March alone. Since the start of this month, the currency has gained 6%.\n\nAccording to key people in the industry, the recent surge of Bitcoin is a notable testament to the resilience and robustness of the cryptocurrency market. \"In particular, it serves as a clarion call for the significance of decentralized finance in the current banking crisis. With traditional banking systems facing numerous challenges, including regulatory hurdles and slow transaction times, the adoption of decentralized finance has become increasingly appealing to investors and enthusiasts. As more people turn to decentralized finance, it is likely that Bitcoin's popularity and value will continue to grow, providing an important avenue for the transformation of the global financial landscape,\" said Kumar Gaurav, founder and CEO, Cashaa.\n\nThe latest Bitcoin rally is expected to uplift the sentiments of the crypto community across the globe and the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade which is scheduled to go live tomorrow, is adding to the euphoria around digital assets. \"Bitcoin-related stocks are also witnessing an upward trend owing to the BTC rally and the momentum is expected to continue if the macroeconomic factors remain favorable,\" says Om Malviya, president, Tezos India.\n\nSome experts are also of the view that with the breaching of $30,000 mark, Bitcoin currency has entered an early bull phase. \"The crypto market cap is at a whopping $1.23 trillion mark with BTC and ETH leading the effort. As Bitcoin price rises, we may also see some investors liquidating their positions to book profit, which may result in a healthy pullback,\" said Shivam Thakral, CEO, BuyUcoin.\n\nDubai-based web3 entrepreneur Bilal Rahazaoui shared his viewpoints on Bitcoin's bull run that Bitcoin rallying past $30K is a significant market movement that presents both opportunities and risks, and added that, \"On the one hand, the renewed investor interest in Bitcoin and the potential for a domino effect on the rest of the market could create profitable trading opportunities. On the other hand, the volatility of the cryptocurrency market and the potential for sudden price swings means that traders need to exercise caution and employ adequate risk management strategies. While the increasing adoption of Bitcoin by mainstream financial institutions and corporations is an encouraging sign, traders must also consider other economic factors and market trends that could impact the value of cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, success in trading cryptocurrencies requires a thorough understanding of the market and a disciplined approach to risk management.\"\n\nThe next Bitcoin halving event (estimated to occur around May 4, 2024), when Bitcoin reaches 840,000 blocks is also expected to drive the price further, \"This halving event marks the fourth protocol-designed 50% reduction in block rewards, which happens every 210,000 blocks or approximately every four years. The upcoming halving is poised to reduce the rate at which new Bitcoin is created, resulting in a lower available supply and increased scarcity. This could lead to higher demand and, surge in Bitcoin's price. The implications of such a significant event have many speculating and watching the markets with bated breath,\" says Rajagopal Menon, vice-president, WazirX.\n\nEven though the increase in the value is being seen as a comeback, Bitcoin is reportedly down more than 50% from its all-time high in November 2021 ($68,789). The devaluation of crypto platforms is said to be happened because of the various components like rising inflation, interest rates and economic uncertainty that drove investors to sell risk assets throughout the year and also the fall of well-known crypto projects including Terra LUNA and Celsius, the major factor was the bankruptcy of FTX exchange.\n\nMeanwhile, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that India's G20 presidency aims to develop a common framework for all countries to deal with risks associated with cryptocurrencies in the wake of the recent shocks witnessed in the crypto market and added that, \"We seek to develop a common framework for all countries to deal with this matter.\" It was also reported that the last year's episode of FTX's bankruptcy, and its spat with Binance triggered a huge sell-off in the market and reduced liquidity. But even with all these pull-backs, Bitcoin has gained the strength to step into this key point.\n\nBitcoin has grown by over 50% since December 2022 and recently crossed the $30,000 mark. \"We believe that the current market is neutral, which is healthy for the overall crypto industry, and that the blockchain ecosystem is gradually regaining momentum. With the risks of inflation and recession, as well as the decline of major banks like SVB and Credit Suisse, there is speculation as to whether Bitcoin could provide a solution to global economic challenges. Nonetheless, the positive sentiment reflected in the rising price of Bitcoin is helping to restore faith in the crypto market,\" said Shrikant Bhalerao, co founder, Seracle"

        "content": "The crypto market continues it's gaining spree with the leader Bitcoin reaching near $30,500 levels, and Ethereum picking up by over 6%. There are a host of positives for cryptocurrencies. These would be sharp cooling in US inflation, and also Ether's Shapella upgrade which is set to be released. Globally, the market witnessed strong demand in both value and volume.\n\nAt the time of writing, on CoinMarketCap, the global crypto market traded at $1.25 trillion up by 2.29% over the previous day. The total volumes in cryptocurrencies zoomed nearly 20% to $48.78 billion over the previous day.\n\nThe market's biggest booster is inflation data. The US consumer price index of all items stood at 5% by end of March 2023 --- which is the lowest since May of 2021. It is also better than Street's expectations of 5.2%. However, inflation continues to stay above US Fed's target levels.\n\nBitcoin traded near $30,225 up by nearly a percent. The crypto has touched an intraday high of $30,462.48 --- which is the 7-day high and also a 1-month high. The crypto hit a 3-month high of $30,509.08 earlier.\n\nCoinDCX Research Team earlier said that if March CPI will be lower than previous months, which could potentially benefit Bitcoin if the Federal Reserve decides to pause rate hikes.\n\nFurther, Ethereum which is the second largest cryptocurrency, traded near $1,982 up by 6%.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ether have recorded around 8% and 6% jump in 7 days.\n\nOn the latest cryptocurrencies performance, Sumit Gupta, Co-Founder & CEO, CoinDCX said: \u201cThe ETH Shapella upgrade is important on 3 counts: security, improved user experience, and more control. The upgrade involves making changes to two important layers in the network - the execution layer and the consensus layer. One of the most important changes being introduced - EIP-4895 - is a new mechanism that will improve the security of the Ethereum network. The ETH network will now be more efficient and reliable and provide an improved customer experience.\"\n\nGupta added, \"Hopefully this will also inspire other blockchain platforms to make the transition to more sustainable consensus algorithms. This upgrade will enable users to stake, earn ETH rewards distributed automatically, unstake to regain full access to their accounts or restake to start over. Post this upgrade, the investor can expect high transaction speed and lower gas fee.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch said, \"The much-awaited Shanghai upgrade and the US\u2019s CPI data have hardly impacted Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Despite the expectation from investors of an aggressive response from markets, BTC continued trading in the $30k zone and went below the mark multiple times in the last 24 hours, while ETH is in the $1.9k zone.\n\nIn alignment with Glassnode\u2019s prediction, Chaturvedi added, \"We don\u2019t see any selling pressure on ETH, which is up ~1% in the past 24 hours, as of around 8 AM today. Around half an hour after the Shanghai upgrade was activated, around 285 withdrawals had been processed for about 5,413 ETH ($10 million worth). In high spirits, investors and blockchain developers have already begun mapping the next steps, i.e., the Verge, Purge, and the Scourge.\"\n\nIn other news, CoinSwitch stated that Argentina has made an official move in crypto by authorising its National Securities Commission (CNV) to launch a bitcoin (BTC) index-based futures contract. Additionally, El Salvador granted its first license for digital asset service providers to BitFinex yesterday. We can expect such moves to positively impact investor sentiment and boost market performance.\n\nInvestor sentiment seems to remain strong, he said.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

        "content": "After a two year break, OpenBazaar, the decentralized marketplace platform, is on its way back to life, according to some vague tweets from its official account.\n\nThe digital marketplace\u2014where users sold goods from homemade candles to medicine\u2014had shuttered in late 2020 due to dried up funding. After initially announcing its closure, the marketplace was temporarily rescued by an anonymous donor\u2014but it ultimately wasn't enough to keep OpenBazaar open for business.\n\nOpenBazaar CEO Brian Hoffman confirmed in a message to Decrypt that he is rebuilding the marketplace, though he declined to add any further detail. The OpenBazaar website has been updated to say \"openbazaar 3.0 - coming soon.\"\n\nopenbazaar was built by the community from nothing.\n\nfor a long time it has slept, but it is now time to grow again from the ashes. \u2014 OpenBazaar (@openbazaar) March 28, 2023\n\nOpenBazaar is like the digital marketplace to Bitcoin\u2019s currency. It was known for its unique approach to online shopping, providing a decentralized marketplace where users could buy and sell goods without the need for a central authority, like, say, Amazon or Etsy. The idea was to give users more freedom over the goods they sold.\n\nThe plan worked for a while before OpenBazaar's funding issues. Merchants set up hundreds of shops, accepting cryptocurrencies for their goods.\n\nAccording to Hoffman's GitHub account (a site where developers post their code publicly for others to use), he has been working on a new implementation of OpenBazaar in the programming language Rust, which is all the rage in Bitcoin lately.\n\nBitcoin Privacy Tool Aims to 'Confuse' Surveillance Companies\n\nOn Twitter, some users are already excited about OpenBazaar\u2019s return.\n\nIn an interview with CoinDesk in 2018, OpenBazaar co-founder Washington Sanchez described OpenBazaar's purpose as such: \"OpenBazaar is supposed to be a free and open protocol for trade using cryptocurrency, a way for currencies and tokens to gain meaningful economic utility to acquire goods and service, and an entry point for people to earn and onboard.\"\n\nFollowing the OpenBazaar's shutdown in 2020, its founders hinted that structural changes would be needed to further place control of the marketplace in the hands of its community and away from the company that initially created it."

        "content": "Driving education and engagement, the Plan \u20bf initiative makes blockchain education a priority with ongoing development program\n\nTether Operations Limited (Tether), the technology company supporting the blockchain-enabled platform that powers the largest stablecoin by market capitalization (USD\u20ae) and the Swiss City of Lugano announced today dates for the second inaugural Plan \u20bf Summer School program.\n\nThe Plan \u20bf Summer School was founded to make blockchain education accessible and to shape a new generation of business owners, students, researchers, and more. It is co-organized with Franklin University Switzerland (FUS), Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana (USI), and University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI). Last year, Tether contributed its expertise and knowledge to this initiative by focusing on educating a new generation of students. The previous program gathered 86 students from 29 different countries including Italy, Switzerland, Taiwan, Canada, Brazil, Colombia all who brought with them a passion for learning about the future of the blockchain ecosystem and exploring new environments.\n\n\u201cA strong focus on education is a vital next step to mainstream adoption of blockchain and the long term implication of blockchain technology,\u201d said Paolo Ardoino, Tether\u2019s CTO. \u201cThe Plan \u20bf Summer School will allow participants to work with leading industry minds on developing peer to peer prototypes and deepening their understanding of the technology helping shape the next generation of founders, developers and creators.\u201d\n\nThe focus of this year's two-week Summer School program will be Bitcoin and Peer-to-Peer technologies and how they will unleash financial freedom and promote the freedom of speech. Course topics will focus on Bitcoin, the Lightning Network, stablecoins, peer-to-peer technologies, mining, blockchain analysis, regulation, self-custody and more. Students will be given the opportunity to choose one of two course tracks. The Satoshi track, which is designed for beginners with little to no experience in coding, but with a general interest in the fundamentals of blockchain, and the Pear track for intermediate to advanced students who are passionate about coding and interested in learning how to build on Peer-to-Peer technologies.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome the Plan \u20bf Summer School once again and we hope the same turnout and attendance as the past year. Lugano will keep making its mark as a crypto and educational hub.\u201d said Michele Foletti, Mayor of the City of Lugano. \u201cWe hope to educate a new generation of potential employers alongside local academic universities in order to make Lugano a hub for the future.\u201d\n\nProminent industry leaders giving their time to guest lecture at the Plan \u20bf Summer School include Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, Adam Back CEO of Blockstream, Giacomo Zucco CEO of Zuckbucks, Sanja Kon CEO of UTrust, Riccardo Masutti Cybersecurity and Privacy Consultant focused in Bitcoin, and more.\n\nLuca Maria Gambardella, Pro-Rector for Innovation and Corporate Relations at the Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana (USI) stated that he wishes to \"promote the Summer School with enthusiasm and commitment, which reinforces the collaboration on education initiated between the partners with the 'B4B - Blockchain for Business' course, and which attracts experts, students and professionals from all over the world to Lugano, strengthening the Lugano Citt\u00e0 Universitaria project as a place of study, meeting and comparison\".\n\nEmanuele Carpanzano, SUPSI's Director of Research, Development and Knowledge Transfer agreed, speaking on behalf of the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland,saying: \"We are delighted to contribute to the realisation of this Summer School in Lugano, an educational proposal in line with the mission we share with our partners: to transmit knowledge and skills, as well as to network students and professionals with each other\".\n\nKim Hildebrant and Dr. Branko Sain, respectively President and Dean of Franklin University's Taylor Institute also declared, \"Lugano's Plan \u20bf is an ambitious project for an ambitious city. We immediately found a common understanding with the Mayor of Lugano and his team around the opportunity to run the first edition of the Summer School last year and the privilege of hosting it again next summer. At Franklin University Switzerland we believe that any kind of progress, be it social, environmental, economic or technological, requires positive change.

        "content": "HONG KONG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Stabolut, a startup building a completely new worldwide payments ecosystem, today announced the launch of a decentralized, dollar-pegged, Bitcoin-backed stablecoin that is not reliant on banks, called USB. Available as of today, USB is a stablecoin issued under a groundbreaking model built on decentralized pillars of trustless infrastructure and security that have made Bitcoin the world\u2019s most trusted and reliable cryptocurrency.\n\nBecoming available on a private beta starting today, USB (US-Bitcoin), a stablecoin that has been built in a revolutionary approach that will reroute the crypto markets unlocking new opportunities for fast and simple trades to power exchanges, financial institutions, businesses, developers, and users.\n\nUSB enters a very hot market, with stablecoins totaling 140 billion in capitalization, and expected to grow to at least 1 trillion dollars.\n\nLeaders in the cryptocurrency industry have been long calling for a stablecoin that is truly decentralized, privacy-preserving and backed by assets that have been verified and audited along with being invulnerable to shutdowns.\n\n\u201cStabolut is setting the new industry leading standards for moving financial value across the internet and crypto markets with USB,\u201d said Eneko Knorr, co-founder and CEO of Stabolut. \u201cThere is clear market demand from users for a reliable stablecoin choice, given the collapse of UST -Terra Luna\u2019s stablecoin-, as well as witnessing the recent instability caused by the de-pegging of USDC following recent bank failures we have seen this year. With USB, Stabolut aims to unlock a new era of transparent, privacy-preserving, fast, inexpensive, and interoperable exchange across the globe,\u201d adds Julian Beltran, co-founder and CTO of Stabolut.\n\nWhile trading futures on BitMEX -the derivatives cryptocurrency exchange- back in 2018, Julian realized how hedging Bitcoin would make it possible to develop a stablecoin pegged to the USD value without having to rely on any stored fiat currency. However, it was not until last year when Eneko Knorr, his now cofounder, joined him to kickstart the project.\n\nIn September 2022, Stabolut embarked on the development of USB, a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin designed to reflect the value of the US Dollar through an innovative method: shorting Bitcoin via a Bitcoin inverse perpetual swap. Asset-backed USB eliminates the need for bank accounts, ensuring immunity from crackdowns or frozen funds, and bolstering complete privacy and resilience. Fiat-backed stablecoins face centralization and regulatory hurdles, limiting access and innovation while increasing counterparty risk and reducing user privacy. USB\u2019s approach aligns with Bitmex co-founder Arthur Hayes' recent Nakadollar (NUSD) concept.\n\n\u201cUSB addresses the limitations of fiat-backed stablecoins, which suffer from centralization and regulatory challenges. By both mitigating counterparty risks and enhancing user privacy, we aim to expand the accessibility and foster innovation in the stablecoin market,\u201d expressed Eneko Knorr.\n\nUSB provides additional benefits such as real-time audits of the assets to ensure transparency and reliability to their users.\n\nStabolut is backed by the founders of Dextools.io, a growing ecosystem with over 30 million monthly views on average. Dextools.io is a platform where traders can keep track of all details about the state of decentralized markets.\n\nOn USB, Frederic Fernandez, co-founder of Dextools.io, expressed the need of addressing CeFi\u2019s shortcomings from previous terms:\"Following the collapse of FTX, Silvergate Capital, Silicon Valley Bank, and many other CeFi platforms in 2022, it is evident that DeFi and the entire crypto industry need better ways to safeguard users\u2019 funds and, most importantly, restore their trust. USB is what we all were looking for.\u201c\n\nTo learn more about the USB stablecoin, visit the Stabolut website.\n\nAbout Stabolut:\n\nStabolut is building an innovative global payments ecosystem. Launched by Julian Beltran and Eneko Knorr, serial entrepreneurs with solid backgrounds in tech and crypto, Stabolut is the issuer of the USB stablecoin. The digital currency is poised to solve all concerns other stablecoins bear, with the clear goal to become one of the most widely adopted stablecoins. Stabolut received funding from the Dextools.io cofounders, a platform that allows traders to track information about decentralized markets.\n\nLearn more: www.Stabolut.com"

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price has surged following better-than-expected news on U.S. inflation.\n\nThe U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March has risen slower than economists predicted.\n\nThe positive news regarding the CPI data has led to some optimistic upside in crypto markets.\n\nIn a sudden turn of events, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) surged by nearly 1.5% to reach $30,430 following the release of positive news that beat expectations. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.1% in March, a slower pace than the 0.4% recorded in the previous month and below the 0.2% forecast by economists.\n\nThe year-over-year CPI was up by 5.0%, a decline from February\u2019s 6.0% and below expectations of 5.2%. Meanwhile, the core CPI, which excludes the often-volatile food and energy prices, increased by 0.4% in March, matching the forecasts and February\u2019s numbers.\n\nThe year-over-year core CPI stood at 5.6%, similar to February\u2019s figures and forecasts. This report positively impacted the price of Bitcoin, which had already been on the rise earlier in the week, breaching the $30,000 mark for the first time since June 2022.\n\nHeadline prints below the Cleveland Fed\u2019s forecast again.\n\n\n\nOverall a great inflation print for the bulls.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s some alpha in tracking how these forecasts play out\ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/JgPodIrPcW \u2014 tedtalksmacro (@tedtalksmacro) April 12, 2023\n\nCPI Report Rallies Bitcoin: Is a Breakout Coming?\n\nThe recent bullish run of Bitcoin has been attributed to speculations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may halt its year-long interest rate hikes. The latest inflation figures may further fuel these beliefs, with Bitcoin popping back above the $30,000 mark within minutes after the report had been released.\n\nInvestors are now eyeing a clean trend breakout with the BTC price. Despite this, the market is bracing for possible volatility in the crypto market, as the CPI report has been known to trigger \u201cfakeout\u201d price action.\n\nOn the Flipside\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s potential interest rate policy shift is not the only factor influencing Bitcoin\u2019s price, as market sentiment and other external factors can also play a role.\n\nInvestors must remain cautious and consider all factors rather than solely relying on short-term market reactions to news events.\n\nThe potential end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hike cycle does not necessarily guarantee a sustained rally in Bitcoin or other markets.\n\nWhy You Should Care\n\nThe CPI data print is an essential gauge of inflation and one of the most critical indicators of the economy\u2019s health. In the crypto industry, the print can impact Bitcoin\u2019s price as investors consider it a hedge against inflation.\n\nTo learn more about how Bitcoin\u2019s price was performing before the CPI and what was expected of the report, read here:\n\nBitcoin Hits 28K.

        "content": "On-chain data shows the Bitcoin leverage ratio has shot up with the rise above the $30,000 mark, something that may cause more volatility for the coin.\n\nBitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio Has Sharply Surged Recently\n\nAs pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, market participants have responded to the price surge by opening high-leverage positions. The \u201cestimated leverage ratio\u201d is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Bitcoin open interest and derivative exchange reserve.\n\nHere, the former is a metric that measures the total amount of positions that investors have opened on the futures market, while the latter tells us about the supply sitting in the wallets of all derivative exchanges.\n\nWhen the leverage ratio has a high value, it means the average futures contract holder is taking on a high amount of leverage, implying that users are willing to take on high risk right now. Generally, such market conditions lead to the price of the cryptocurrency turning more volatile.\n\nOn the other hand, low values of the metric suggest the holders aren\u2019t willing to take on much leverage currently. Naturally, the BTC value can become more stable while this kind of trend lasts.\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin estimated leverage ratio over the last few weeks:\n\nThe value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nAs shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin estimated leverage ratio has rapidly risen in the last couple of days as the price of the cryptocurrency has broken above the $30,000 mark for the first time in about 10 months. This means that investors have started to open positions on the futures market with a high amount of average leverage.\n\nWhen leverage is high in the market, a large number of liquidations can take place at once if a sharp enough swing in the price takes place. Such mass liquidations generally only end up fueling the price move that caused them further, thus leading to even more liquidations in the process.\n\nWhen liquidations cascade together in this fashion, the event is termed a \u201cliquidation squeeze.\u201d This type of occurrence is the reason why markets with high leverage can turn quite volatile.\n\nSince the leverage ratio has shot up recently, a squeeze may now be more probable to take place in the near future. Any volatility that may result from this, however, can go either way.\n\nBut considering that the indicator\u2019s value has risen with the price, it\u2019s possible that a lot of long positions have amassed in the market, implying that a long squeeze may be more likely. If such a squeeze does take place, the price would take a bearish hit.\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $30,000, up 5% in the last week.\n\nLooks like the value of BTC has sharply gone up over the last two days | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Jievani Weerasinghe on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Pumps Past $30,000 - While New Meme Crypto Hits $3.7 MILLION - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, recently soared past the crucial $30,000 price level, setting off a flurry of speculation about its next move. With its volatility and unpredictable nature, Bitcoin\u2019s price prediction remains a hot topic among investors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nBesides Bitcoin, there\u2019s a hot new crypto in town called Love Hate Inu (LHINU) that\u2019s capturing everyone\u2019s attention. With its unique blend of meme coin fun and utility-based approach that\u2019s never been seen before, it\u2019s creating a buzz in the market. Already raising over $3.7 million and counting, this project is definitely one to watch. Before that, let\u2019s take a closer look at Bitcoin breaking $30K.\n\n>>>Get The Best Crypto Now<<<\n\nBTC Skyrockets To New Heights As Cryptos Rally\n\nBitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets have been on a remarkable rally, with BTC surging past a key level to reach its highest point since the crypto crash last summer. During the last few hours, Bitcoin\u2019s price has jumped 6% to $30,100, marking an 80% increase since the beginning of the year. This surge has sparked calls for a new bull market, and many investors are taking notice.\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the current price pattern and expect further upward momentum. Many experts believe that although some profit-taking may occur at the current level, the price will likely continue rising due to the strong momentum. In fact, bearish traders with short positions have already been wiped out, with over $150 million in Bitcoin shorts liquidated since Monday, potentially adding further upward pressure to the market.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s return above the psychological level of $30,000 is seen as a bullish signal to traders, as it hasn\u2019t reached this level since the crypto industry faced a series of collapses last June. The bullish sentiment is also fueled by Bitcoin\u2019s sensitivity to macroeconomic forces, including its correlation with stocks. Although Bitcoin is outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 this year, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to fight inflation previously. However, Bitcoin prices have rebounded this year because of expectations that the Fed will be more accommodative.\n\nInvestors are eagerly awaiting inflation data due in the coming days, including the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI), as it could solidify bets on the Fed\u2019s next move, potentially leading to a pause on rate hikes. James Lavish, Managing Partner at the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, suggests that if Bitcoin pushes through the $30,000 level with conviction, it could see further gains into the mid-to-high $30,000s, forcing short speculators to cover and buy.\n\nMillions Made Quickly: Another Crypto Soars to New Heights\n\nWhile Bitcoin is grabbing headlines for reaching new heights since the previous crypto market downturn, there\u2019s another cryptocurrency that\u2019s been making waves with its unique approach. Let\u2019s take a closer look at what this crypto is all about and why it\u2019s causing a stir in the market.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now<<<\n\nLove Hate Inu (LHINU) \u2013 Earn Crypto for Your Opinions\n\nLove Hate Inu (LHINU) is a fascinating new meme coin project that\u2019s all about leveraging the power of Web3 and blockchain technology to revolutionize the survey industry. With its unique Vote-2-Earn (V2E) mechanism, you can participate in polls on a wide range of topics and earn rewards for your input. From the latest pop album releases to hypothetical scenarios like the election of a North Korean president (yes, they\u2019ve got polls for that, too!), LHINU offers a fun and engaging way to voice your opinions and earn crypto rewards in the process.\n\nOne of the coolest things about LHINU is that it\u2019s built on the Ethereum network, which means that every poll entry is recorded on the blockchain. This ensures transparency and reliability in the poll results, giving users peace of mind that their votes are secure and verifiable.\n\nThe Love Hate Inu team is dedicated to bringing real-world utility to the meme coin space. Their innovative Vote-2-Earn (V2E) model is a game-changer, combining the excitement of meme coins with a practical use case that has been lacking in the industry for a long time.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now<<<\n\nPutting The Power Back In The Hands Of The Community\n\nThe great thing about Love Hate Inu is during its presale; they\u2019re selling a whopping 90% of the tokens, so there\u2019s no risk of developers swiping your money and running off. The remaining 10% is reserved for rewards and Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs). This makes LHINU a true community project, with tokens available for fans to participate and vote in the polls.\n\nUnlike other projects where tokens are divvied up among founders or big investors, Love Hate Inu is all about giving the power back to the community. With LHINU tokens required for voting, every poll reflects the genuine opinions of Love Hate Inu fans.\n\nOnce the platform launches, the development team will kick off with creating polls, but the plan is to eventually hand things over to the community by the end of 2023. That means the community gets to decide which polls to introduce and whether they should be up for a vote. It\u2019s all about giving the community a voice and making LHINU truly community-driven.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now<<<\n\nBreaking Records: Presale Hits Unprecedented Heights\n\nLove Hate Inu\u2019s presale has been a smashing success, raising an impressive $3.7 million and counting. With a hard cap of $10 million, it\u2019s expected to surpass this limit before the scheduled date, urging investors to act fast.\n\n\n\nCurrently priced at $0.000105, the token is set to increase to $0.000115 in a few days. The project has already gained massive hype, with over 15,000 members in its Telegram group. Investors are excited about the potential for substantial returns, with predictions of up to 45x, making Love Hate Inu a hot option for those looking to ride the wave of meme token popularity.\n\n>>>Buy Love Hate Inu Now<<<\n\nConclusion\n\nAs Bitcoin breaks past $30,000 and continues its upward momentum, investors and enthusiasts are eagerly watching its next moves. Meanwhile, Love Hate Inu (LHINU), the hot new meme crypto, is making waves with its unique Vote-2-Earn (V2E) mechanism, bringing real-world utility to the meme coin space. With a successful presale raising over $3.7 million and counting, LHINU\u2019s community-driven approach and innovative use case are garnering attention in the crypto market. So go ahead and get your LHINU tokens.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez has predicted that Bitcoin is on the verge of experiencing a parabolic rise. He mentioned that aSOPR (adjusted spent output profit ratio) exceeded 1, which hinted at bullish action. If it stays below zero, it signifies a bear market. Moreover, the digital asset has reached its all-time high, which makes sense as there are over one million holders of BTC. Another crypto analyst Michael Van de Poppe predicted that Bitcoin is unlikely to go down beyond $25,000. Instead, he expects BTC to break out above $30,000.Recent reports suggest that whale wallets containing between 100 million and 1 billion ADA have been actively buying up Cardano\u2019s native cryptocurrency, ADA. In just two short weeks, these wallets have acquired a whopping 560 million ADA, signaling a strong interest in the cryptocurrency from high-net-worth investors. Martinez was the first to take notice that the tokens were worth $218 million. Data shows that 51% of ADA investors are long-term holders, hodling the coin for over one year. Cardano\u2019s network has exceeded 4M total addresses, and this year, over 79,000 non-zero addresses have shown interest in the digital asset.

        "title": "Gold and Bitcoin compete for safe haven crown in Q1\u2019s turbulence - FE Trustnet",
        "content": "13 April 2023\n\nAnalysts reckon gold has reasserted its role as a haven in times of volatility but are more mixed on cryptocurrencies.\n\nBoth gold and Bitcoin rose in the opening three months of 2023 when investors were spooked by bank collapses but the jury is still out on whether cryptocurrencies are reliable portfolio hedges.\n\nGold is seen as a classic \u2018safe haven\u2019, tending to rise during times of market stress while keeping up with inflation over the long run. This has led many cautious investors to maintain an allocation to the yellow metal within their portfolios.\n\nCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, meanwhile, are a much younger asset class and have had a more volatile track record. However, cryptocurrencies\u2019 decentralised nature and limited supply has led many to see the asset class as another hedge against choppy markets and inflation.\n\nBoth gold and cryptocurrencies have outperformed global equities since the start of the year: gold is up close to 6.5% in sterling terms while Bitcoin has surged more than 75%. FE Analytics does not cover Bitcoin, but the below chart shows how stocks linked to blockchain technologies have had a strong run.\n\nPerformance of indices over 2023 to date\n\nSource: FE Analytics\n\nThe performance of both assets in recent weeks has been driven by turmoil in the banking sector, which sparked a market sell-off and sent investors running towards perceived safe havens.\n\nRob Morgan, chief analyst at Charles Stanley Direct, said: \u201cInvestor confidence in banks is shaking, with SVB and Credit Suisse the latest big names to collapse. Gold is often a financial \u2018teddy bear\u2019 investors cling to in times of crisis, so it is no surprise to see interest picking up as uncertainty strikes.\u201d\n\nMirva Anttila, director of digital assets research at WisdomTree, said the strength of digital assets like Bitcoin was down to investors expecting central banks to ease policy in response to the recent bank failures \u2013 lower interest rates would benefit long-maturity assets such as digital assets.\n\nAnttila added \u201cwe could be on the cusp of the fourth major bull market in crypto\u201d, if advancements in speed and scalability of the blockchain networks, more intuitive user interfaces and innovations in blockchain wallets help support uptake of the technology.\n\nPerformance of bitcoin over 2023 to date\n\nSource: Google Finance\n\nCharles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Syz Group, pointed out Bitcoin is sometimes referred to as \u2018digital gold\u2019 as its time-limited supply is one of its main similarities to precious metals. Its production will be capped at 21 million by 2140; supply growth of 1.8% today will ease to 0.9% in four years and just 0.4% in the following four years.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is now scarcer than gold,\u201d he added. \u201cSince its launch, Bitcoin's monetary policy has made it the most robust and scarce currency on the planet.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has survived many mistakes, shocks and even so-called \u2018hard forks\u2019. Bitcoin has been declared dead many times. Bitcoin mining has been banned in several countries, causing huge mining farms to be shut down immediately without any consequences for the Bitcoin network. It is this ability to survive and strengthen during crises that makes bitcoin an anti-fragile asset.\u201d\n\nMonchau conceded that this case was undermined somewhat by the cryptocurrency\u2019s performance in 2022, when it showed a high correlation with tanking stock and bond markets. Last year, Bitcoin fell some 65%.\n\nHowever, he believes that the historical data is \u201cunequivocal\u201d and shows that a 5% allocation to Bitcoin in a 60/40 portfolio improved the risk-return trade-off regardless of the period considered.\n\n\u201cDue to the high volatility of bitcoin, a small allocation or investment in a fund of hedge funds dedicated to digital assets may be appropriate in the current macroeconomic environment,\u201d he said.\n\nNot everyone is convinced though.\n\nCharles Stanley Direct\u2019s Morgan argued that Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with stocks and bonds in 2022 \u2013 where market falls were ultimately down to shifting inflation and interest rate expectations \u2013 suggests that is not a reliable portfolio hedge.\n\n\u201cA nascent, unproven and unregulated asset, Bitcoin\u2019s widespread adoption is far from assured, and it represents a very risky proposition. It\u2019s why we don\u2019t consider it, nor any other cryptocurrency, an investment,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u201cOn balance, it\u2019s worth considering bit of exposure to gold as a \u2018real\u2019 asset with wealth preservation characteristics, but bear in mind it will likely be frustrating asset to own with extended periods in the wilderness.\u201d"

The team has not made a trade official, but many believe it will happen before the start of the 2023 season.\n\nWhile Rodgers has been outspoken about his intent to leave the Packers and play for a new team in 2023, the quarterback could also be sharing his early opinion on the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWith an Instagram stories post, Rodgers shared a promotion of a podcast interview featuring anti-vaxxer Aubrey Marcus and anti-vax presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. In the post, Rodgers showed the hashtag #kennedy2024 and two flexed bicep emojis, alongside two heart emojis. Rodgers has been a guest on Marcus\u2019 podcast several times.\n\nKennedy Jr., the son of former presidential candidate Robert Kennedy and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, filed to run for president as a Democrat in the 2024 election.\n\nWith his anti-vax platform, Kennedy Jr. has seen his family distance themselves from him, according to the Washington Post. Kennedy Jr. previously compared COVID-19 vaccine mandates to the Holocaust and said that things were worse during COVID-19 with mandates than they were for Anne Frank, a comment he later apologized for.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has not officially declared his intent to run for president in 2024 but an announcement is expected anytime and Biden is the current favorite to get the Democratic nomination.\n\nKennedy Jr. is seen as a longshot to win the Democratic nomination and overall 2024 election. Betting odds from Covers show Kennedy Jr. listed at odds of +10,000, implying a 0.99% chance of becoming the next president.\n\nRelated Link: Aaron Rodgers Says Ayahuasca Helped Him Achieve 'Best Season' Of His NFL Career And Love Himself\n\nAnti-Vax and Anti-Crypto?: Rodgers support for Kennedy Jr. comes as both have been well-known for their stances on vaccinations.\n\nKennedy Jr. has been a major advocate against vaccines, which has led to the presidential candidate being banned from Instagram and having an organization he backs banned from Instagram and Facebook.\n\nRodgers faced backlash after previously saying he was \u201cimmunized\u201d against COVID-19 and misleading the public and potentially the NFL about his vaccine status. Rodgers missed an NFL game in the 2021 season after testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe Packers quarterback said he underwent alternative treatment because of being allergic to an ingredient in the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna.\n\nWhile it shouldn\u2019t come as a huge surprise that Rodgers is backing a fellow anti-vax candidate, Kennedy Jr. and the quarterback may differ on opinions on another topic, the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nKennedy Jr. has been vocal as a candidate against central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\n\u201cCBDCs grease the slippery slope to financial slavery and political tyranny,\u201d Kennedy Jr. said. \u201cA CBDC tied to digital ID and social credit score will allow the government to freeze your assets or limit your spending to approved vendors if you fail to comply with arbitrary diktats, i.e. vaccine mandates.\u201d\n\nWhile Kennedy Jr. is speaking out against CBDCs, he could show future support for Bitcoin with additional comments.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin give the public an escape route from the splatter zone when this [financial] bubble invariably bursts,\u201d Kennedy Jr said.\n\nRodgers has been a proponent of Bitcoin BTC/USD and cryptocurrency over the years. In 2021, the quarterback announced a partnership with CashApp, a unit of Block Inc SQ.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pumped to share that I\u2019ve recently teamed with CashApp, they\u2019ve enabled me to take part of my salary in Bitcoin for the very first time,\u201d Rodgers said in a video.\n\nRodgers also offered fans the chance to win $1 million in Bitcoin through the partnership.\n\n\u201cI believe in Bitcoin & the future is bright.\u201d\n\nRodgers was also featured at the Bitcoin 2022 Conference where he encouraged college athletes who have NIL and scholarship money to invest a portion into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cThe Fed keeps printing trillions of dollars, you know, the best defense against inflation, I believe is Bitcoin, and they will keep printing money.\u201d\n\nRead Next: Trump Gains Against DeSantis In New Poll After Indictment, Here's How He Matcches Up Against Biden For 2024 Election\n\nPhotos: Shutterstock"

        "content": "After Bitcoin (BTC) finally managed to cross the psychological barrier at $30,000, cryptocurrency analysts are predicting more success to follow for the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset due to the historical chart patterns indicating it has completed all the necessary prerequisites to start a major bullish rally.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin has completed its last pullback \u201cbefore heading to the Moon,\u201d i.e., toward $190,000, while the new bottom before an all-time high (ATH) is expected to be in the $29,000 \u2013 $30,000 area, according to a projection shared on Twitter by pseudonymous crypto analyst BitQuant on April 13.\n\nBitcoin price action analysis and prediction. Source: BitQuant\n\nOne day before, the crypto market analyst published a slightly different assessment, arguing that the price of Bitcoin typically undergoes two retests after breaking the 10-week EMA (exponential moving average). In the same tweet, BitQuant also stressed that \u201cin this particular cycle, we are still awaiting the final retest before the price skyrockets to $190,000.\u201d\n\nThis earlier prediction was based on the observed activities of the maiden digital asset in 2020 and 2021, when the 10-week EMA and the bottom were, indeed, followed by two retests, after which the price soared toward the ATH of $69,000, which it finally reached in November 2021.\n\nBitcoin price action analysis and prediction. Source: BitQuant\n\nIf today\u2019s updated projection is correct, it would mean that there are no further obstacles for Bitcoin to start its move toward $190,000, which the analyst expects will materialize in 2024.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nIn the meantime, the price of Bitcoin at press time stood at $30,210, recording an increase of 0.66% on the day and 7.14% across the previous week, adding up to the monthly gain of 24.94% and 81.69% since the year\u2019s turn, as per the latest data retrieved on April 13.\n\nBitcoin year-to-date (YTD) price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nElsewhere, Bitcoin has been demonstrating significant strength against fiat currencies such as the United States Dollar (USD), the British Pound (GBP), the Chinese Yuan (CNY), and the Russian Ruble (RUB), which have all been going through a bloodbath in recent months, as Finbold reported on April 11.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Warren Buffett has issued a warning that there has been a boom of gambling in the financial markets. He has also thrown a jab at bitcoin, stating that the cryptocurrency has no inherent value.\n\nEven though Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price has increased by more than 80% since the beginning of the year, the most popular cryptocurrency asset still has its critics.\n\nImage: FREENVESTING/YouTube\n\nIs Bitcoin A \u2018Gambling\u2019 Coin?\n\nIn an interview Wednesday with CNBC, one of the most successful investors in the world known as the \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d took the opportunity to take another shot at Bitcoin, this time calling it a \u201cgambling token.\u201d\n\n\u201c#Bitcoin is a gambling token and it doesn\u2019t have any intrinsic value. But that doesn\u2019t stop people from wanting to play the roulette wheel,\u201d says Warren Buffett on #crypto. pic.twitter.com/6MQAiyrS5J \u2014 Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) April 12, 2023\n\nBuffett made the following observation in reference to gambling in general:\n\n\u201cThe urge to participate in something that looks like easy money is a human instinct which was always there.\u201d\n\nThe big boss at Berkshire Hathaway has previously referred to the popular crypto as \u201crat poison squared\u201d and declared that it is a \u201cmirage\u201d that attracts charlatans. Additionally, he has cautioned investors to steer clear of the cryptocurrency, describing it as a \u201cdelusion.\u201d\n\nThe critique of Bitcoin that comes from the business magnate\u2019s notion that investments should have some sort of inherent value is where the criticism originates.\n\nThe anti-crypto billionaire views these types of digital assets as speculative that are vulnerable to dramatic price swings and do not have any fundamental value.\n\nBuffett, Not A Fan Of Bitcoin\n\nRecent weeks have seen significant gains across the board for crypto markets. According to Messari, Bitcoin and Ethereum have had respective gains of 61% and 35%, although they are still approximately 56% and 36% behind their all-time highs, which were reached in November of 2021.\n\nOn Tuesday, the price of BTC went beyond $30,000 for the first time. The previous time that occurred was back in June. Two days later, it was still approximately $29,900 at that point.\n\nIt is common knowledge that Buffett is not a fan of bitcoin; in fact, he previously stated that even if someone offered him $25 for all the bitcoin (BTC) in the world, he would not buy it.\n\nHis senior deputy and Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger has been even more vocal over the years about his distaste for the alpha coin. Earlier this year, he called for the US government to outlaw cryptocurrency in a manner similar to that of China.\n\nAccording to Buffett, the human propensity to gamble is one of the factors that drives investment in cryptocurrencies. He stated that committing funds to the asset class will \u201ceat up\u201d one\u2019s financial resources.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) total market cap currently at $582 billion on the daily chart at TradingView.com\n\nBitcoin Up Nearly 8% In The Last Week\n\nA number of influential people have expressed their reservations regarding bitcoin. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, gave an interview to CNBC in January during which he referred to bitcoin as a \u201chyped-up fraud\u201d and compared it to a \u201cpet rock.\u201d\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is now ranked as having the world\u2019s eighth-largest market capitalization in terms of its assets, as reported by the most recent information from companiesmarketcap.com.\n\nAccording to the same source, the market value of Bitcoin is currently the 10th largest in the world.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC is trading at $30,104, up 7.7% in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker CoinMarketCap shows.\n\n-Featured image from PAUL MORIGI/GETTY IMAGES/FORTUNE/TIME INC."

        "content": "Although George Soros once described Bitcoin (BTC) as a \u201ctypical bubble,\u201d comparing it to the \u2018tulip mania\u2019 that engulfed The Netherlands in the mid-1600s and expressing worries about its volatility, his views seem to have changed since then. Today, his investment firm even owns some of the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset.\n\nAs it happens, in the summer of 2021, it became public knowledge that Soros Fund Management, the asset management company founded by the billionaire investor and philanthropist, received the green light from its CIO, Dawn Fitzpatrick, to trade \u201cBitcoin and perhaps other cryptocurrencies,\u201d although Soros himself did not offer any comment, as Finbold reported on June 30, 2021.\n\nSupporting crypto\n\nHowever, his support for crypto had become obvious earlier in April 2021, when he joined a $200 million fundraising round for a Bitcoin financial technology business New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG), as a strategic investor alongside MassMutual, FS Investments, and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), among others, demonstrating an increase in the institutional adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nMore recently, Soros\u2019s fund has increased its exposure to the crypto industry, as it purchased $8,984,659 in convertible notes of crypto miner Marathon Digital Holdings convertible into 39.6 million common shares, according to a 13F filing with the United States Securities and Exchange (SEC) dated to December 31, 2022, and revealed in February 2023.\n\nOn top of that, earlier information has revealed that Soros Fund Management also owned call options and put options on 50,000 shares of enterprise business intelligence (BI) software vendor MicroStrategy. This could be equal to holding Bitcoin through a proxy because of the company\u2019s massive crypto purchases, which Hal Press, the founder and CEO of the crypto-focused investment fund North Rock Digital criticized harshly.\n\nAlthough the billionaire\u2019s private crypto holdings are unknown, Alex Jones alleged he had rejected $5 million in Bitcoin from Soros to pump the digital asset, as he told Joe Rogan in an episode of the \u2018Joe Rogan Experience\u2019 in February 2019. If Jones was truthful, and taking into account its average price in 2018, Soros owned at least 760 BTC at the time, which today would be worth around $23 million.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "TV personality and the host of \u201cMad Money,\u201d Jim Cramer, has long been a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP. However, his recent comments on the crypto market have drawn the ire of many in the community, who have been quick to point out the irony of his predictions.\n\nLast month, Cramer advised investors to sell Bitcoin just as the cryptocurrency was starting to rally on March 14. Since then, Bitcoin has surged 24%, leaving many to mock the financial analyst\u2019s advice. Indeed, Bitcoin was trading at $24,152 at the time and is currently trading at $29,976 at the time of publication.\n\nBitcoin 1-month price chart. Source: Finbold\n\n\u201cBitcoin went up today. Bitcoin\u2019s a strange animal. I will say point blank, I think it is being manipulated up. It was being manipulated the whole time by Sam Bankman-Fried, so please don\u2019t assume, therefore, that it\u2019s not still being manipulated,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cI would sell my Bitcoin right into this rally. And believe me, I had been a believer in Bitcoin at one time. But not here, not now.\u201d\n\nDespite Cramer\u2019s doubts about cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has continued to perform strongly, confounding many traditional investors who remain skeptical of digital assets.\n\nMove out of Bitcoin quickly\n\nAn \u201cinverse Jim Cramer\u201d strategy or portfolio would involve doing the opposite of what Cramer recommends on his show. Some investors believe that an inverse Jim Cramer strategy can be profitable, as his picks are not always accurate and may be subject to bias or other factors.\n\nSome investors who follow the \u201cinverse Kramer\u201d strategy view Jim Cramer\u2019s moments of fear and capitulation as an opportune time to buy in. In other words, when he expresses negativity or advises caution on a particular stock or crypto, these investors see it as a signal to enter the market.\n\nNotably, back on January 10, the tv personality suggested \u2018move out\u2019 of Bitcoin quickly, with it notably trading at $17,192 at the time; however, compared with the price at the time of publication, BTC has climbed over 74% since that date.\n\nPeople want to believe the best. I believe that you can move out of tech slowly and bitcoin and friends quickly \u2014 Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) January 10, 2023\n\nInterestingly, XRP coincidentally crashed 14% from its 2023 high of $0.58 before a slight rebound after TV personality Jim Cramer said the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \u201cmay not even win\u201d its lawsuit against Ripple.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
