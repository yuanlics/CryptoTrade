        "content": "Cryptocurrency prices rose broadly on Monday, with bitcoin climbing above $27,000 for the first time this month.\n\nBitcoin was last higher by less than 1% at $26,685.97, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier it rose as much as almost 4% to $27,403.17. Ether was slightly higher also and trading at $1,635.90.\n\nThe reason for the move wasn't clear, although there was a spike in trading volume during opening hours in the Asian market, said Dessislava Aubert, senior research analyst at crypto data provider Kaiko.\n\n\"In the current low liquidity environment, relatively low buying and selling pressure could amplify spot price movements and spur liquidations on derivatives markets,\" she said."

        "title": "20 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In this article, we will be talking about the 20 countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most. We will also discuss the recent trends in the crypto market along with the major players in the industry. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most.\n\nWill Bitcoin Grow to an All-Time High by 2024?\n\nOn September 7, Forbes analyzed what the future holds for Bitcoin. According to the report, Bitcoin has witnessed significant price improvements in 2023. After a rough period for the crypto market in 2022, Bitcoin reported a strong comeback in 2023. In July, Bitcoin climbed to $31,000. While the price for one Bitcoin slightly deteriorated to $25,956 on September 13, experts expect a recovery soon. According to the report, Bitcoin seems to be under inflationary pressure. Inflationary pressures forced the Fed to raise interest rates. Such has contributed to a major resistance in the trade of Bitcoin at the price of $28,900. The report informs readers that, as per the Indian government, all transactions of digital assets would be regulated by the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). While crypto laws are necessary, stringent regulations may limit the growth of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nDespite the turmoil surrounding the current status of Bitcoin, the reports hint at 2024 being a game-changer for the cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin halving event is expected in 2024, which brings the hope of a boost in the price of Bitcoin. The halving event takes place every four years. During the halving event, the price reward to Bitcoin miners is cut by 50%. Such helps contract the supply and is a positive sign for Bitcoin's price.\n\nUncertainty and volatility surrounding Bitcoin have been a common trend this year. Stringent regulations in countries and a worsening global macroeconomic condition limit the ability of experts to predict the future of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, experts hold high expectations for the coming year. Take a look at the most valuable currencies in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Do the New Crypto Regulations Mean?\n\nThe United States is home to one of the most crypto owners. However, this does not exclude the American market from the wrath of uncertainty and volatility of currencies. On August 25, Reuters reported new crypto regulations introduced by the Biden administration. According to the new tax reporting rules, crypto brokers must report sales and exchanges of all digital assets to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The new tax reporting regulations were primarily aimed at countering tax evasion. On the bright side, the new tax regulation makes processing easier for regular crypto taxpayers. The regulation aligns with the administration's efforts to bring in more money from taxes. With the new bill in action, the estimated tax revenue for the next decade is almost $28 billion. To shed light on the importance of tax regulations for the future of the economy, the treasury reported:\n\n\"This is part of a broader effort at Treasury to close the tax gap, address the tax evasion risks posed by digital assets, and help ensure that everyone plays by the same set of rules.\"\n\nWhile regulation is a prerequisite for the mass acceptance of crypto or Bitcoin as a mainstream payment method, stringent laws may limit user's willingness to invest in cryptocurrencies. The impact of the new tax regulations can only be judged in the coming months.\n\nAre Large Corporations Withdrawing Interest in Crypto?\n\nAre large companies with significant stakes in the crypto market distancing themselves from the crypto industry? Is this because of stringent laws or the falling prices of Bitcoin?\n\nOn August 25, CNBC reported that Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) recently ended its partnership with Binance. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) will not offer branded Binance cards in Latin America and the Middle East anymore. Users used these cards to purchase commodities directly with their crypto assets. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) also ended its partnership with Binance in July. Such indicates the growing concerns of holding partnerships with companies currently surrounded by intense regulatory scrutiny.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that companies are withdrawing interest crypto as a mainstream payment method. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) still offer a range of crypto cards, allowing people to make hassle-free payments using their crypto assets.\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) offers prepaid cards funded by Tap, Nexo, and Gemini. The company's efforts in transforming the crypto landscape continue, regardless of the scrutiny around the crypto market. On August 17, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) announced its new Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Partner Program. To kick-start the program, the company involved a group of leading blockchain providers to join the program. These include Ripple, Consensys, Fluency, Idemia, Consult Hyperion, Giesecke+Devrient, and FireBlocks. The company understands the importance of having a government-mandated public digital currency. Raj Dhamodharan, head of digital assets and blockchain at Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), spearheading the program, stated:\n\n\"We believe in payment choice, and that interoperability across the different ways of making payments is an essential component of a flourishing economy. As we look toward a digitally driven future, it will be essential that the value held as a CBDC is as easy to use as other forms of money.\"\n\nSimilarly, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is also making leaps in the crypto market. On September 5, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) announced it is expanding its stablecoin capabilities. The company will now introduce the USDC stablecoin on the Solana blockchain network. The company has been experimenting with the USDC stablecoin since 2021 and has now integrated the Solana network due to its efficient and speedy systems. Cuy Sheffield, Head of Crypto, Visa, stated:\n\n\"By leveraging stablecoins like USDC and global blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum, we're helping to improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to send or receive funds from Visa's treasury easily. Visa is committed to being on the forefront of digital currency and blockchain innovation and leveraging these new technologies to help improve how we move money.\"\n\nBlock, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a leading financial technology and software firm based in the United States. The company formerly began the development of Bitkey, a crypto product. This product is made to store all your digital assets in a physical wallet. The company is making leaps in the industry and reports strong earnings, which reflects that the crypto industry is far from declining. On August 3, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) reported results from the second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $0.39 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.02. The company's revenue for the quarter jumped 25.67% year over year and amounted to $5.53 billion, ahead of market consensus by $433.36 million. Jack Dorsey, head of Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), also discussed the company's plans and important partnerships to boost the integration of cryptocurrencies in the business. He stated:\n\n\"Earlier this year, we shared plans for the public beta testing of our bitcoin wallet, Bitkey. And in June, we announced our first two global partners, Coinbase and Cash App, to allow customers to buy and immediately transfer bitcoin from those custodial platforms into Bitkey's self-custody wallet.\"\n\nLarge corporations investing in the development of crypto is a positive sign for cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. However, crypto-friendly laws are essential to boost crypto ownership and establish crypto as a primary payment method. With that, let's take a look at the 20 countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most.\n\n20 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most\n\nPhoto by bitcoin executium on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo determine the countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most, we integrated three different metrics. These included the total population from the World Bank, the percentage of the total population that owns cryptocurrencies by Triple A, and the crypto adoption index by Chainanalysis. We considered data as of 2022 for consistency across all our metrics. The crypto adoption index by Chain Analysis is based on five different metrics. These metrics are a combination of the retail value of the cryptocurrencies, the value of cryptocurrencies at centralized exchanges, and trade volume.\n\nWe shortlisted the top 50 countries from each of the three data sources. The crypto adoption index and percentage of the total population that owns crypto were given a higher priority. Of the two databases, we chose the first 20 common countries for our list. The figures for the total population were included as reference figures to add credibility to our data.\n\nAccording to our hypothesis, high crypto usage will translate as high bitcoin usage. We have ranked the 20 countries that use crypto and Bitcoin the most in ascending order.\n\n20 Countries that Use Crypto and Bitcoin the Most\n\n20.

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Could Surge Before, After 2024 Halving - ETF Trends",
        "content": "Another bitcoin halving \u2014 the event that lowers rewards for miners, thus tightening supply of the flagship cryptocurrency \u2014 is coming in six months.\n\nThere are instances of halvings boosting bitcoin prices, but it\u2019s not a guarantee. This time around, there\u2019s much division among cryptomarket observers regarding whether or not the 2024 event will be a catalyst for bitcoin prices.\n\nHowever, one noted crypto expert \u2013 the X (formerly Twitter) account known as BitQuant \u2014 believes the upcoming halving could be a major upside catalyst for bitcoin prices. If that predication proves accurate, exchange traded funds such as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO) and the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users and Decentralized Commerce ETF (BLKC) could benefit.\n\n\u201cNo, bitcoin is not going to top before the halving. Yes, it\u2019s going to reach a new all-time high before the halving,\u201d according to a recent BitQuant xeet. \u201cNo BTC is not going to $160K because the magnitude of every pullback is large.\u201d\n\nPotential Benefits Abound for Bitcoin Funds BLKC, SATO\n\nBitcoin\u2019s all-time high is around $69,000, meaning it\u2019d need to more than double from current levels to get back to that price range. Alone, that would likely propel BLKC and SATO due to the fact that both ETFs are chock full of crypto-correlated equities.\n\nAdditionally, BitQuant isn\u2019t saying bitcoin can\u2019t make it to $160,000. Rather, the expert acknowledges that there could be another significant retreat when prior highs come into play and another pullback if the $125,000 price range becomes a factor.\n\n\u201cThere will be one pullback before breaking to a new all-time high, followed by another pullback around $125K. Additionally, there will be two more pullbacks after the halving,\u201d added the expert in another xeet.\n\nBitQuant added that bitcoin\u2019s price could peak after the 2024 halving, which implies that the digital currency will experience a rally in advance of and after that event. The market observer\u2019s price forecast is $250,000, or more than nine times where it currently resides.\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious projection to be sure, and one that would almost assuredly benefit assets such as BLKC and SATO. It also jibes with the forecasts of other cryptomarket specialists who believe that the mid-$30,000s or even low $40,000s are reasonable expectations for a year-end price in 2023 before bitcoin ascends to six-figure territory around next year\u2019s halving.\n\nvettafi.com is owned by VettaFi LLC (\u201cVettaFi\u201d). VettaFi is the index provider for SATO and BLKC, for which it receives an index licensing fee.

        "title": "Can Bitcoin Reach $100,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC -1.25%) has been a winning investment this year, with its price up almost 60% in 2023 (as of Sept. 15). Interest from investors is growing after a tumultuous 2022 that saw digital asset prices tank as major businesses in the industry blew up. But it might be a good idea to set your eyes on a new price target, even after the huge gain this year.\n\nIn November 2021, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of nearly $69,000. And while it's 62% off that peak right now, I believe that the world's top cryptocurrency can reach $100,000 within the next five years. By looking at the quantitative and qualitative factors, I think other investors would tend to agree with this forecast.\n\nRunning the numbers\n\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin's price is roughly $26,000, and its market cap is just over $500 billion. To keep the calculation nice and simple, if the crypto hits $100,000, it would translate to a gain of 300% in the next five years, good for an annualized increase of 32%. That return would surely crush the rise of the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite, but it would match Bitcoin's trailing-five-year return.\n\nIn five years, Bitcoin's market cap would total $2 trillion. That might seem like a lot, but consider that the total value of all the gold on Earth is about $12.5 trillion. As Bitcoin becomes a more legitimized and widely accepted store of value, it should steadily creep up on the total market cap of the popular precious metal. But even in our scenario, Bitcoin would only be worth 16% of gold, a penetration rate that might seem conservative to some bulls.\n\nAt a roughly $2 trillion market cap, Bitcoin would still be less valuable than Apple, which is currently worth $2.7 trillion, and Microsoft, with a value of $2.5 trillion. So while a $100,000 price target might seem like a lofty expectation at first glance, it still leaves Bitcoin trailing some of the most successful businesses of all time, a completely reasonable outlook.\n\nWhy should demand rise?\n\nThose calculations make sense and aren't a stretch of the imagination to believe, but the ultimate question remains why more individuals, institutions, or governments would even want to own Bitcoin in greater quantities in the years ahead. It's illuminating to focus on this asset's qualitative characteristics.\n\nAccording to bitinfocharts.com, Bitcoin can only process less than six transactions per second (TPS). This pales in comparison to Visa, the card payments giant, which can theoretically handle 65,000 TPS. Consequently, Bitcoin hasn't shown much promise as a medium of exchange in day-to-day payments. In fact, in developed countries, the existing payments infrastructure works pretty well.\n\nHowever, I believe that Bitcoin's key thesis centers on more parties using it to store their wealth. From a basic supply-and-demand perspective, owning an asset of which there will only ever be 21 million coins seems like a smart decision. As demand rises combined with a fixed supply cap, the price is set to continue climbing higher over time, even though it won't be a smooth ride.\n\nBesides the promise of huge financial returns, Bitcoin can be a worthy store of value when compared to fiat currency. Government-backed money has been devalued over the past century thanks to enormous amounts of money creation, particularly in the past decade or so. This has resulted in the U.S., a country viewed as the world's economic powerhouse, having a whopping $33 trillion in debt outstanding, a figure that has expanded over time and that doesn't include underfunded liabilities like Medicare and Social Security.\n\nI think more market participants, whether individual or institutional investors, corporations, or even governments, are starting to look at Bitcoin as a hedge against something breaking with the traditional financial and monetary system. As more learn about this cryptocurrency, it's not crazy to believe that its price should approach the $100,000 mark. I wouldn't be surprised to see this milestone reached by the end of 2028."

We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available.\n\nBitcoin's annual transaction volume has outpaced Visa. This is a significant milestone, especially when you consider that Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network and has not achieved global usage on the scale of Visa. But before popping the champagne, let's delve into some nuances that often go unnoticed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst off, the term \"transaction volume\" can be a bit misleading. In Bitcoin's case, a large chunk of network activity in the past year came from Ordinals \u2014 a protocol that allows satoshis in the blockchain to be assigned a unique identifier and transacted with extra data like images, for example. The protocol conducts high-frequency transactions. So, while the sheer volume of transactions is impressive, it is not necessarily indicative of widespread retail use or adoption.\n\nBitcoin has surpassed Visa's annual transaction volume. Pretty incredible for a decentralized settlement network.\n\n\n\nNext up: ACH and ultimately Fedwire. pic.twitter.com/32VTILMNXI \u2014 Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) September 16, 2023\n\nNow, why is it tricky to compare Visa and crypto networks like Bitcoin in terms of transactions? Well, Visa is a centralized payment system that has been around for decades, fine-tuned for consumer transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a decentralized network where transactions can represent anything from a coffee purchase to a multi-million-dollar asset transfer. The two are fundamentally different beasts, each with its own set of rules, limitations and use cases.\n\nThat said, Bitcoin surpassing Visa in transaction volume is still a momentous occasion. It is a testament to the growing influence of decentralized networks. It also raises questions about what the financial landscape could look like in the future. Could decentralized networks one day become the norm, rendering centralized systems obsolete?\n\nAs for now, full adoption of decentralized payments is not going as smoothly as crypto enthusiasts would expect. El Salvador's experiment has clearly shown numerous weaknesses and issues the general population faces when interacting with digital payments."

        "title": "What Europe's new spot Bitcoin ETF means for global markets - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The crypto world is abuzz with Europe\u2019s groundbreaking introduction of its first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund from Jacobi Asset Management, listed on Euronext Amsterdam \u2014 a listing that took two years after initial approval in 2021. This development marks a pivotal moment in the continent\u2019s financial history and sets a precedent for other jurisdictions to potentially follow.\n\nIn the wake of this, there\u2019s a palpable sense of anticipation. As digital assets gain traction, Europe\u2019s decision underscores a commitment to innovation while addressing the complexities of the crypto market \u2014 the harbinger of a global shift towards a more inclusive and diversified financial ecosystem. With Hong Kong\u2019s renewed ambition to be a major crypto hub and debuting retail crypto trading via licensed exchanges, it may not be long before we see the first spot Bitcoin ETF in Asia, too.\n\nEurope paving the digital highway\n\nOver the past decade, Europe has witnessed a steady growth and acceptance of digital assets. From the grassroots level of early enthusiasts trading cryptocurrencies to towering financial institutions exploring and adopting blockchain solutions, the continent has championed digital asset innovation.\n\nThis commitment to progress has set the stage for the current developments. Pivotal regulatory discussions, such as the European Union\u2019s deliberations on the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, have sculpted the digital financial landscape in Europe. These regulatory strides, buoyed by interest from institutional investors, have culminated in the introduction of the spot Bitcoin ETF, marking a significant leap forward.\n\nInside the spot Bitcoin ETF\n\nA spot Bitcoin ETF offers a more appealing route for institutional and professional investors to invest in Bitcoin through a more familiar product structure. The ETF offers a structured and regulated way for investors to tap into Bitcoin\u2019s potential. Unlike holding Bitcoin directly, which comes with security and storage concerns, the ETF provides a more traditional investment vehicle.\n\nStory continues\n\nJacobi\u2019s ETF is regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission and trades under the ticker BCOIN. What sets Jacobi\u2019s Spot Bitcoin ETF apart is its stringent regulatory compliance, ensuring investor protection. By bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world, it showcases the transformative potential of such instruments in the evolving financial landscape.\n\nAs Europe leads, US remains reluctant\n\nEurope\u2019s introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF sets it apart as a pioneer, especially when contrasted with the United States, which, despite its dominant crypto market presence, has been reticent in approving a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nThis strategic divergence could recalibrate global financial market dynamics, potentially positioning Europe as a magnet for digital asset investments. The more conservative stance in the U.S., likely rooted in regulatory apprehensions and market fluctuations, accentuates the differences in regulatory visions between the two jurisdictions. It also highlights the challenges and opportunities that digital assets present, emphasizing the need for a nuanced and informed regulatory perspective.\n\nRipple effects beyond Bitcoin\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF\u2019s introduction might act as a catalyst \u2014 it\u2019s akin to opening a door, inviting other digital assets to step into the spotlight. This pioneering step could spur the development of ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies or even lead to the creation of multi-asset cryptocurrency ETFs.\n\nThe ETF\u2019s debut could also influence investor strategies, potentially driving more institutional investment into the digital asset space.\n\nOld giants learning new dance\n\nTraditional financial entities, spanning banks to asset managers, now grapple with the undeniable reality of digital assets becoming mainstream. The once clear lines between traditional finance and the world of cryptocurrencies are blurring. As digital assets gain legitimacy, especially with regulatory clarity in certain jurisdictions, the financial sector is undergoing a transformative shift.\n\nWe\u2019re also witnessing an uptick in traditional banks establishing relationships with crypto companies, propelled, in part, by the U.S. bank closures earlier this year. In March, Coinbase partnered with Standard Chartered in Singapore for free fund transfers. Following Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s failure, Circle announced Cross River as its new banking partner. In Switzerland, Arab Bank reported an increase in U.S. firms from the crypto space seeking banking services after Silvergate\u2019s collapse.\n\nThe broader financial sector might witness seismic shifts in asset allocation strategies, advisory services, and financial product portfolios in response to this digital renaissance. The dynamic landscape painted above highlights the adaptability of the financial world.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s effect on regulatory perspectives\n\nGrayscale\u2019s recent court victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is a testament to the changing tides. The federal appeals court\u2019s decision to side with Grayscale, challenging the SEC\u2019s rejection of their spot Bitcoin ETF, is significant. According to JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou in a recent note: \u201cIt looks more likely that the SEC would be forced to approve the Spot Bitcoin ETF applications that are still pending from several asset managers, including that from Grayscale.\u201d This not only underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets but also highlights the need for regulatory bodies to adapt to the evolving financial landscape.\n\nGrayscale\u2019s landmark victory against the SEC has set a precedent that could catalyze the approval of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs. This development could inject more competition into the market, potentially lowering fees for investors.\n\nBalancing innovation and regulation\n\nThe introduction of an avant-garde financial instrument like a spot Bitcoin ETF is not devoid of pitfalls. From market volatility to regulatory uncertainties, there are challenges to consider. Vigilant regulatory oversight becomes paramount to anchor market stability and shield investors from potential market manipulations or fraud. As with any investment, education is key. Ensuring that investors are well-informed can prevent speculative bubbles and uninformed investment decisions.\n\nEurope\u2019s Bitcoin ETF introduction signals a new era in finance, where digital assets and traditional finance come together. As Europe treads this new path, the balance between innovation and regulation will be pivotal to ensure a stable and prosperous financial future.\n\nThe journey has just begun. Collaborative efforts, informed regulations and continuous education will be crucial as Europe navigates the evolving digital asset space. And Grayscale\u2019s win across the water is another positive sign of progress."

        "title": "Will Bitcoin Surge Above $30K, or Below $20K From Here? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Because Bitcoin (BTC -1.25%) makes up roughly half of the overall market capitalization of the cryptocurrency sector, the direction it trades typically drives the direction of the overall market. While that can be frustrating for investors in many smaller-cap projects, it's also true that Bitcoin's momentum often dictates the price action of other projects across the spectrum.\n\nAccordingly, key psychological thresholds simply get much more attention when it comes to Bitcoin over other digital assets. With the world's largest cryptocurrency currently trading right around $26,000 per token at the time of this writing, there's some significant uncertainty as to which direction this token will trend over the medium term.\n\nBitcoin liquidations continue to drive significant volatility, tend to exacerbate rallies to the upside, and make intraday losses more untenable for investors. Indeed, much of the downside move we've seen in Bitcoin in recent months appears to be tied to such liquidations, with bullish investors seeing more pain than those taking a cautious stance.\n\nWith that said, there are reasons why investors may want to shift their view to a more bullish one moving forward. Let's dive into the bull case and bear case as to why Bitcoin could make a sharp move higher or lower from here.\n\nWhat could drive Bitcoin above $30,000\n\nTo be fair, the $30,000 threshold is one that's more likely to be attained in the near to medium term than the $20,000 level, at least in my view. That's largely because I think investors are about to catch on to the fact that more institutional money is poised to flow into the cryptocurrency sector, and mostly into Bitcoin.\n\nInvestors may have heard the news: A three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals has given a favorable interpretation for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to be launched. This panel granted Grayscale Investments' petition for review, to have its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust rolled into a spot Bitcoin ETF.\n\nWithin the ruling, this panel suggested that the SEC acted arbitrarily in its ban on spot Bitcoin ETFs, accepting the argument that spot and Bitcoin futures markets are extremely highly correlated. Essentially, the panel couldn't answer the question that, if futures ETFs are allowed, why are spot options not available to the public?\n\nThe SEC has delayed making a decision on the spot Bitcoin ETFs on its desk until October. However, it's my view that, at the end of the day, spot Bitcoin ETFs will be available to investors within the next few months. This ruling was pretty definitive, and it's the latest blow for the SEC, which likely won't want to take more losses in its crusade against this sector.\n\nAs more institutional capital flows into Bitcoin, an effective floor may be placed under the token, at least over the intermediate term. There's a tremendous amount of capital sitting on the sidelines in alternative assets such as precious metals and real estate that may be looking for a home in the crypto sector. If a fraction of this capital moves into spot Bitcoin ETFs, the initial buying activity and excitement around capital inflows could create a self-fulfilling price surge.\n\nWhat could push Bitcoin below $20,000\n\nThe crypto sector in general has dealt with a myriad of headwinds over the past two years. From late-2021 highs to today, the price of Bitcoin has plunged from a high of around $69,000 per token to the aforementioned $26,000 level. That decline of more than 60% is painful for investors who bought near the top, but it's certainly not as devastating as other declines we've seen in the sector. In many regards, Bitcoin has been an outperformer relative to the alt coin space, and will likely remain so moving forward.\n\nThat said, many of the same catalysts that forced valuations lower in the crypto sector in 2022 remain in place. Interest rates are likely to remain higher for longer, as inflation continues to hover around twice the Federal Reserve's target (at least on core CPI). For riskier and more speculative asset classes like crypto, that's not a recipe for asset price inflation over the medium term.\n\nAdditionally, the amount of leverage in the crypto sector could drive significant moves to the downside in short order, should some sort of shock materialize. The yield curve has been inverted for a long time (one of the longest inversions in recent history). If we get the shock that many are waiting for, the economy tips into recession, and most of the excess liquidity in the markets dries up, that's not a good sign for Bitcoin.\n\nAre the bulls or bears right?\n\nUltimately, as with other risk assets like equities, bear markets and recessions happen, and valuations take a hit during these periods. I don't have my crystal ball out, so I can't predict if something terrible is on the horizon. However, it's the possibility that a recession could be right around the corner that has many investors on the sidelines.\n\nWe'll see whether the bulls or bears are proven right, but I remain on the sidelines with Bitcoin for now."

        "title": "Bitcoin Price Tops $27K as Fed's Powell Might Be More 'Hawkish': Strategist - CoinDesk",
        "content": "Bitcoin is breaking above $27,000. As us traders see greater odds of the Federal Reserve keeping rates unchanged this week and perhaps for the rest of the year joining us now to discuss is Matrix Port head of research and strategy, Marcus Steen. Welcome Marcus. Thanks for having me. Good to see you. So, you know, we, we look at this latest move up in, in Bitcoin uh above 27,000, it looked pretty dismal. I think even your own uh research uh just a few, a few days ago, it seems would have said quite the opposite that this was going in the other direction. Uh Even though there were some bullish signs nonetheless, it was a, it, it, I don't know if anyone expected this to happen so quickly, but over the weekend, a move up above 27,000. What was the catalyst here? I, is it really this sort of risk on with the fed not raising rates uh potentially at this upcoming meeting this week or uh at the next meeting as well? I mean, you could make an argument that of course, Powell is gonna be a little bit more hawkish, uh, coming, you know, the, this, this, uh, FO MC meeting, you know, we have higher oil prices. Uh, we had last week, of course, the upsides of price in the CP I index, we had, we have a stronger dollar, uh, we have a higher 10 year bond yield. So I think you can make an argument that Powell might be a little bit more hawkish. Maybe the market is not going to buy into it, but of course, he could be hawkish. But of course, the, you know, coin itself has been in a very tight range over the last kind of like one or two months. And the fact is that we are breaking now high. And if you can close here, actually, this sets off all sets off our, our kind of technical trading signals and this actually could be quite bullish for, for Bitcoin itself. But nevertheless, I think we can also paint a bar picture on some of the al coins on Ethereum. So I think it's more like a relative trade. And I think what's very interesting to note here is when we started to break down like last week in Bitcoin in, in the overall crypto market at exactly the same level when when Blackrock announced the ETF, the Bitcoin ETF filing at 25,100 at exactly the same level we heard actually that Franklin Templeton is coming out with, with Bitcoin ETF. So it seems like uh there is a quite an interesting coincidence here at this level that this level is really protected in the market. And it reminds us a little bit of what happened in 2017 with Bitcoin. So I I you you brought up the old coins and there's one in particular Solana, Solana had a nice slight bounce a few weeks ago prior to an announcement since then. Uh It's now the funding rate is now negative uh negative 35%. Uh last data that I have here at the time. They, it and it's been and it's just over the past few days in which the funding rate has gone negative. In other words, people are paying borrowers to go along in uh in, in Salana that and this is, this is just a pretty bearish uh outlook. What is, first of all, what's your take on that slight bump prior to their announce uh their, their partnership announcement? Was there anything involved in um a a, do we know anything about who the potential buyers were? And is this latest selloff or, and this negative out? Look if you will a product of the fear of the FTX, uh uh the, the FTX selloff that will potentially happen as uh a a as the company tries to recoup recoup dollars for its creditors. Yeah, I think of course, that's, that's an overhang and I think the number was a little bit low larger than people initially expected how much actually the FTX creditors can sell. Uh they got the green light so they will be ongoing selling at least until end of the year. You know, we estimate and by the by the $200 million cap that has been uh um kind of flagged flagged by the creditor team and where they got the approval from. But also, I think overall SOLANA is really fighting a little bit for, you know, for, for its existence here, the market cap is still quite high. Um At the same time, you know, the the protocol has still various outages. Um it has really not delivered on a lot of those promises. I mean, you might recall, they wanted to come out with a Solana uh phone beginning of the year and it came out. I mean, nobody has heard of it really or nobody is using it. So, and I think a lot of those, those NF or high frequency trading has actually moved to, to other venues. So I think Solana itself is, is a very high beta and it's quite, quite at risk of of breaking down lower Marcus on the topic of this appending alt coin crash. You also said that crypto VC funds are under immense pressure to return funds to their investors. Um What do you what unpack that for us? What is driving this pressure? Yeah. So for example, a lot of investors have of course made huge returns in in those crypto VC funds, you know, over the last few years, I mean, some funds are up, you know, 10, 2030 times, but of course, they have given back a lot of, a lot of the money as well. And I think now some investors say, well, maybe now we're going to redeploy the capital into another area, maybe in A I, so we rather cash out here. And of course, those we see funds, they are early investors in in various projects. Be it a infinity? Be it be, you know, for example, a coin and these unlocks uh are happening, you know, we had one over the weekend. Um and when we flag this, for example, a month ago, the acorn is actually down 30% right? And this despite, for example, that Bitcoin is more or less, you know, held up. So we like to really pair, you know, certain tokens against Bitcoin because we have, of course, a lot more uh buying pressure potentially uh through these ETF S announcement. And when you, when you look very carefully, Bitcoin actually peaked out so far this year in July versus EUM peaked out in April. So you really can see that all these announcements about Bitcoin ETF S have really not really been been benefiting with these Al coins or even Ethereum. And then of course, ec MS revenue has been dropping now for three consecutive months. And I think this just shows that people are not really engaging with Ethereum or other um kind of like al coins. And I think this just sets a negative um you know, precedent for those protocols. But going back to your question is really, you know, if I'm ABC investor uh or if I'm an investor in ABC Fund, of course, I would like to like to have some, some payouts now and every time these unlocks are coming and these unlocks coming really in, in large numbers, for example, last weekend, you know, it's around like 11% of the, the market cap of a coin unlocked. So I rather, you know, encourage, you know, my, my BC manager to come of sell the tokens and distribute the money back to, you know, to the, to the, I guess to the LP S and of course, in a, in a month's time, we have uh you know, another unlock for a infinity. And these, these unlocks are really uh tokens that the VC investors, you know, got over the last few years and they're certainly, you know, investing now. And so I think there's this constant pressure now uh for those tokens to really just uh see a lot of liquidation happening. So bottom line, do you see the al apocalypse, the, the, the end or the pretty much the end of alt coins coming up? And if so how soon? Well, I think, you know, of course, you know, it helps if the over crypto market was lower than for, to call for a Bitcoin crash. And as long as, or for a crypto crash, but as long as of course, a Bitcoin stays above 25,000, I think we are sort of in a, in a safe or in a neutral zone. But as soon as we, we get closer to this level, I think the risk is, is really high. Um, and I think you also have to look, you know, what was the real, the real driver of the last of the last bull market? And I think of the 21 bull market, there were two drivers, there were, of course, the yield farming craze. Uh, this was really like a child of the zero interest rate policies and we are no longer in this environment. So it's unlikely that those, uh, those yield farming tokens, you know, really come back in a, in an environment when interest rates are very high. Uh, or the other factor was, of course, the second leg of, of the 21 bull market was, of course, the NF uh, but so far, I mean, you know, we, we know all the volumes of NFTS and uh, the correction keeps on going lower. So I think those are, are the ones that are really at risk, anything around Gamification, anything around, um, you know, NFTS and anything around yield farming. I don't think they want to come back in any new bull market. I mean, I'm still quite constructive on Bitcoin overall. And I think we we're gonna have a new bull market uh you know, into next year, but I would be very careful with some of the dialings of the previous bull market and especially with some of these al coins that are seeing a lot of unlock happening. Marquez. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. Thank you. That was Matrix Port, Head of Research and strategy Marcus. Th."

While this remains questionable, it\u2019s become evident that mining companies today are focusing more on alternative energy resources to cut costs, ensure profits and, in some cases, reduce their environmental impact.\n\nAlternative energy sources used by miners\n\nSteven Lubka, managing director for Bitcoin-focused financial services company Swan Bitcoin, told Cointelegraph that while the average rate to mine a single Bitcoin (BTC) is around $26,000, mining companies focused on renewable energy sources are seeing rates between $5,000 and $15,000 per BTC.\n\nA spokesperson for Riot Blockchain, a United States-based publicly traded Bitcoin mining company, told Cointelegraph that wind and solar energy generated across Texas has helped Riot ensure some of the lowest costs to mine crypto. \u201cAs stated in our Q2 investor deck, it costs Riot $8,389 to mine 1 Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\n\nAerial view of Riot Blockchain's Rockdale mining site. Source: Riot Blockchain\n\nKent Halliburton, president and chief operating officer of Sazmining \u2014 a hosted Bitcoin mining provider \u2014 told Cointelegraph that the biggest expense for mining has always been electricity:\n\n\u201cBitcoin miners are naturally incentivized to find the lowest-cost power. Excess electricity is the lowest priced. With renewables, there is often excess electricity, which makes it a perfect fit for Bitcoin mining.\u201d\n\nHalliburton added that independently sourced data from the Bitcoin Mining Council shows that the Bitcoin network may indeed be one of the most sustainable industries. According to the source, 59% of mining operations are carbon-free and growing at a rate of nearly 4.5% per year.\n\n\u201cAll of our mining operations in Wisconsin and Paraguay are utilizing excess hydroelectricity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shift to alternative energy sources seems to be a trend for miners thinking about long-term success. Phil Harvey, CEO of crypto mining infrastructure provider Sabre56, told Cointelegraph that the company is currently working with dozens of mining companies to get machines set up across Sabre56\u2019s three facilities located in Wyoming and Ohio.\n\nSaber56's Bonepile site in Gillette, Wyoming. Source: Rachel Wolfson\n\nHarvey explained that Sabre56\u2019s facility in Gillette, Wyoming \u2014 known as \u201cBonepile\u201d \u2014 hosts nearly 2,200 mining machines that are powered by a combination of energy sources, including a material contribution from renewable energy. The 5,200-square-foot site draws on Basin Electric\u2019s mixed energy portfolio. According to Basin Electric\u2019s website, this includes 24% wind, 0.6% recovered energy and 4.3% hydro, which adds up to 28.9% renewables.\n\nHarvey said, \u201cThe machines at our Bonepile site consist of a mixture of MicroBT Whatsminer M50s and Bitmain Antminer S19s. In terms of the site design and methodology, we leverage a forced-air design, meaning air is forced into the facility to cool the machines.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harvey, the Bonepile facility is designed to ensure surplus air provision. Harvey explained that this method reduces overheating and strain on the mining equipment while also allowing the miners to naturally exhaust hot air through overpressure.\n\n\u201cThis is different from the standard design widespread in the mining industry, which is often extracting the hot air with an additional mechanism while not having a system in place to aid air into the facility,\u201d he remarked.\n\nOceanBit, a company developing renewable energy platforms using ocean thermal sources, is taking a different approach. Michael Bennett, co-founder of OceanBit, told Cointelegraph that the company is integrating Bitcoin mining into its ocean thermal energy power plant design. \u201cThis will allow us to balance variable loads, deliver power faster to offshore operations, and monetize excess energy to improve plant profitability,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to Bennett, ocean thermal energy is the largest untapped energy source on the planet. \u201cIt\u2019s a base load source of renewable energy, like hydro or geothermal, but uses the temperature difference in ocean water to generate electricity.\u201d\n\nBennett believes Bitcoin is the missing piece needed to scale the energy source to global adoption since it solves a number of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) commercial challenges.\n\nDiagram of OceanBit's thermodynamic cycle. Source: OceanBit\n\nNathaniel Harmon, co-founder and CEO of OceanBit, elaborated, \u201cThe byproduct of OTEC generation process is four degrees Celsius cold water, which makes it ideal for cooling ASICs, while the byproduct of ASICs is low grade heat, which makes it ideal to use in the OTEC process. The combination increases the efficiency while decreasing the cost of both.\u201d\n\nBennett shared that OceanBit plans to unveil its R&D power plant in Hawaii in 2024.\n\nSome alternative energy sources are controversial\n\nPennsylvanian crypto mining company Stronghold Digital Mining is using coal refuse to power its mining operations.\n\nThis refuse \u2014 also known as gob, culm or boney \u2014 is the result of the refining process of coal mining. These unrefined bits of coal mixed with shale, slate or other impurities are piled on thousands of acres of abandoned mine lands in Pennsylvania.\n\nGreg Beard, CEO of Stronghold Digital Mining, told Cointelegraph that his firm is working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and local environmental authorities to clean up piles of waste coal and use them to power Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nHe said, \u201cAcid mine drainage from these piles is one of the largest sources of water pollution in Pennsylvania. The waste piles have also been catching fire for decades by way of spontaneous combustion, releasing toxic pollution into the air. Stronghold converts the coal refuse into power by way of specialized facilities and then either supplies the power to the local grid or uses the power to mine Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin mining is required to continue the waste coal cleanup activities, making it a much more efficient operation than miners seeking out power sources,\u201d added Beard.\n\nWhile this does provide a method of cleaning up the tons of coal refuse, from an environmental perspective, it also poses something of a Catch 22.\n\nThe special plants that can use refuse coal are still burning hydrocarbons. The Pennsylvania arm of the Energy Justice Network project has even contended that refuse coal-firing plants pollute more than new coal plants.\n\nStronghold itself further came under the scrutiny of environmental groups when it applied for a permit to burn tire-derived fuel at its Panther Creek plant.\n\nClean Air Council activist Russell Zerbo recently said on a podcast that the plant \u201cuses the electricity it produces to generate cryptocurrency; rather than selling that electricity to the energy grid, the plant should be completely repermitted as a solid waste incinerator that would be subject to increased air pollution monitoring requirements.\u201d\n\nChallenges for miners may hamper adoption\n\nWhile it\u2019s notable that crypto mining companies are using alternative energy sources, certain challenges could hamper adoption. Halliburton claimed that misinformation regarding alternative energy sources is common:\n\n\u201cLocal populaces may throw-up roadblocks because they don\u2019t realize that Bitcoin miners are providing a net benefit to their local communities through job creation and monetizing wasted or excess electricity. Electricity is also misunderstood; it\u2019s extremely expensive to store, and if electricity is not utilized or stored when it\u2019s generated, it gets wasted \u2014 quite literally put into the earth.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the challenges that come along with using renewable energy are also evident. Harvey mentioned that the altitude of Gillette, Wyoming results in much thinner air quality. As such, the machines at Sabre56\u2019s Bonepile facility can struggle with pulling in enough air required for cooling.\n\nThen comes the challenge of thermal pollution, as hot air is released into the atmosphere from the mining machines, which Cointelegraph witnessed firsthand at the Bonepile site in Wyoming. Given this, some mining companies are finding unique ways to reuse heat production. For instance, Genesis Digital Assets uses hot air produced by mining equipment to grow vegetables in the Nordic regions.\n\nHeat from mining machines is used to grow plants inside a greenhouse. Source: Genesis Digital Assets\n\nAll things considered, the future of mining operations will likely rely on renewable sources. Margie Feng, head of marketing at Bitmain \u2014 a leading producer of crypto mining equipment \u2014 told Cointelegraph that the company has shifted gears and is currently working hard on promoting hydro-cooling technologies, as she believes that demands for this type of equipment will only grow in the future.\n\nFeng added that Bitmain has found that almost a quarter of all Bitcoin miners use water to power their setups, while wind and nuclear are the second- and third-biggest contributions, respectively."

        "title": "Bitcoin investors are bullish on the US Fed's $100B loss - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The U.S. Federal Reserve made a significant announcement on Sept. 14, revealing accumulated losses of $100 billion in 2023. What\u2019s more, this situation is expected to worsen for the Fed, according to Reuters. But for risk assets like Bitcoin (BTC), this may actually be a blessing in disguise.\n\nThe Fed in the red\n\nThe primary reason behind this financial setback is that the interest payments on the Fed\u2019s debt have surpassed the earnings generated from its holdings and the services it provides to the financial sector.\n\nAs a result of this development, investors are now scrambling to grasp how this will impact interest rates and the demand for provably scarce assets like BTC.\n\nFed earnings remittances due to the U.S. Treasury, USD (millions). Source: St. Louis Fed\n\nSome analysts are of the opinion that the Fed\u2019s losses, which commenced a year ago, could potentially double by 2024. The central bank categorizes these negative results as \u201cdeferred assets,\u201d arguing that there\u2019s no immediate necessity to cover them.\n\nThe Fed used to generate revenue for U.S. Treasury\n\nHistorically, the Federal Reserve has been a profitable institution. However, the absence of profits does not hinder the central bank\u2019s ability to conduct monetary policy and achieve its objectives.\n\nRelated: How do the Fed\u2019s interest rates impact the crypto market?\n\nThe fact that the Fed\u2019s balance sheet has incurred losses isn\u2019t surprising, especially given the substantial interest rate hikes, which escalated from near-zero in March 2022 to the current level of 5.25%. Even if interest rates remain unchanged, Reuters suggested that the Fed\u2019s losses are likely to persist for some time. This can be attributed to the expansionary measures implemented in 2020 and 2021 when the central bank aggressively acquired bonds to stave off a recession.\n\nEven if interest rates remain unchanged, Reuters suggested that the Fed\u2019s losses are likely to persist for some time. This can be attributed to the expansionary measures implemented in 2020 and 2021 when the central bank aggressively acquired bonds to stave off a recession.\n\nIn essence, the Fed functions like a conventional bank, as it must provide yields to its depositors, which primarily consist of banks, money managers and financial institutions.\n\nAn article in Barron's effectively illustrates the impact of the $100 billion loss, stating,\n\n\u201cThe Fed banks\u2019 losses don\u2019t increase federal budget deficits. But the now-vanished big profits that they used to send the Treasury did help hold down the deficit, which is $1.6 trillion so far this fiscal year..\u201d\n\nU.S. total gross debt and debt ceiling, USD (trillions). Source: BBC\n\nClearly, this situation is unsustainable, particularly considering that the U.S. debt has now reached $33 trillion. While one might point fingers at the Fed for raising interest rates initially, it\u2019s essential to recognize that without such measures, inflation would not have returned to 3.2%, and the cost of living would have continued to exert pressure on the economy.\n\nUltimately, the significant demand for short-term bonds and money market funds is a reflection of the trillions of dollars injected into the economy during the peak of the pandemic. Nevertheless, even if one settles for a fixed 5% yield on a three-month investment, there\u2019s no guarantee that inflation will remain below this threshold for an extended period.\n\nFurthermore, investors are confronted with the risk of dilution each time the U.S. Federal Reserve injects liquidity into the market, whether through the sale of assets from its balance sheet or when the Treasury raises the debt limit.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s improbable that fixed-income returns will outpace inflation for another 12 months because, at some point, the government will exhaust its funds and be compelled to issue additional Treasurys.\n\nReal estate and stocks no longer a reliable store of value\n\nThere remains a significant unanswered question regarding which sector or asset class will reap the most benefits when inflation catches up with short-term Treasury yields. This uncertainty arises as the S&P 500 stands just 7% below its all-time high, while the real estate market exhibits signs of strain due to mortgage rates hitting their highest levels in over two decades.\n\nOn one hand, the S&P 500 index doesn\u2019t appear excessively valued, trading at 20x estimated earnings \u2014 especially when compared with previous peaks that reached 30x multiples or even higher. However, investors are apprehensive that the Fed may find itself compelled to further raise interest rates in order to combat the prevailing inflationary pressures.\n\nAs the cost of capital continues its ascent, corporate earnings will come under pressure, leaving investors with no secure harbor for their cash reserves.\n\nPresently, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may not seem like a viable hedge option, but this perspective could shift as investors realize that the U.S. government\u2019s debt ceiling is essentially boundless. Thus, it might make sense to gradually accumulate these assets regardless of short-term price trends.\n\nCollect this article as an NFT to preserve this moment in history and show your support for independent journalism in the crypto space.\n\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

        "content": "On September 17, 2015, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) officially declared Bitcoin a commodity, a distinction that eight years later continues to set it apart from other cryptocurrencies that have yet to earn this status.\n\nWhile regulatory uncertainty still looms over other more centralized, digital assets, the CFTC's classification of Bitcoin as a commodity established a regulatory framework for Bitcoin, one that allows it to be treated like other classical commodities including gold and precious metals.\n\nIn its ruling, the CFTC stated that Section 1a(9) of the CEA defines commodity to include \"all services, rights, and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.\"\n\n\"The definition of a 'commodity' is broad... Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are encompassed in the definition and properly defined as commodities,\" the agency wrote at the time.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under the leadership of Chairman Gary Gensler, has been actively scrutinizing various digital assets to determine whether they should be classified as securities, an ongoing evaluation that has created a complex and evolving landscape for altcoins.\n\nIn recent remarks, Chairman Gensler reiterated the SEC's commitment to maintaining a strong regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. He emphasized that the distinction between commodities and securities depends on the specific characteristics of each digital asset.\n\nGensler acknowledged that while Bitcoin, due to its decentralized nature, qualifies as a commodity, other cryptocurrencies exhibit traits that might classify them as securities.\n\nThe determination hinges on factors like the degree of centralization, utility, and the presence of third-party entities. Gensler's remarks underscore the ongoing debate within regulatory circles about how to classify cryptocurrencies effectively.\n\nOf much debate has been the Howey Test, the regulatory standard set in the 1900s that seeks to establish when a certain investment offers the promise of a financial return from the work of others.\n\nCrucially, Bitcoin, with its use of proof-of-work as a consensus mechanism allows anyone in the world who can generate electricity to purchase or create a mining machine, whose calculations can enable that participant to claim the new cryptocurrency that it creates.\n\nThis distinction separates Bitcoin from the ambiguity surrounding other altcoins, and continues to be a major catalyst for Bitcoin's legitimacy and growth in the financial markets at a time when the regulatory status of other cryptocurrencies, at least in the United States, remains mired in uncertainty.\n\nThe 8th anniversary of Bitcoin's classification as a commodity is a reminder of the progress made in this regard, even as other cryptocurrencies await definitive regulatory guidance from the SEC.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Bitcoin Continues Its Price Surge, Hitting $27.4K. But Will the Rally Last? - Unchained - Unchained",
        "content": "The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has risen more than 7% over the past week amid encouraging economic news from China and the reduced likelihood of an interest rate hike later this week. But one analyst doubts the rally\u2019s staying power.\n\nBitcoin continued its recent upswing on Monday, rising above $27,400 at one point \u2013 its highest point since August 31. It remained in positive territory even after a midday slide.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading near $26,814, up about a percentage point over the past 24 hours. BTC has risen more than 7% over the past week. It sank below $25,000 last Monday but began surging after the release of encouraging economic data from China, and amid the growing likelihood that the U.S. central bank will not raise interest rates at its meeting this week.\n\nYet Conor Ryder, head of research and data at USDe stablecoin creator Ethena Labs, doubted the staying power of the recent rally, including Monday\u2019s jump.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still too much uncertainty to expect a prolonged and durable rally,\u201d Ryder wrote in an email to Unchained. \u201cThis brief surge is more indicative of the sort of sideways action in a market that is still very much in a recovery phase from the tumult experienced last year.\u201d\n\nRyder wrote that macroeconomic conditions, particularly inflation and \u201cregulatory uncertainty\u201d in the crypto space, including the possibility that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could delay or reject proposed spot bitcoin ETFs, were dragging on markets. In addition, the ongoing legal process involving FTX remained unsettling for markets.\n\nStill, Ryder was optimistic about the digital asset industry\u2019s medium- and longer-term future, given the rising interest of financial services giants, including Visa and PayPal, which recently announced initiatives to enable stablecoin payments.\n\n\u201cI expect more such developments to occur, including in the realm of tokenizing real-world assets,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd in the next year or so, we\u2019ll likely be experiencing a number of positive catalysts for the industry, such as the forthcoming bitcoin halving.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now, though, it\u2019s mostly a game of patience and gradual accumulation,\u201d he added.\n\nEther, the second largest cryptocurrency in market value, was recently changing hands at $1,640, a 0.8% gain from Sunday, the same time. ETH has also risen more than 6% during the past seven days, buoyed by the same favorable winds that have carried BTC. Other altcoins were in the green with SOL and ADA, the tokens of smart contract platforms Solana and Cardano recently up more than 1.6% and 4%, respectively, over the past day.\n\nTON, the native crypto of layer 3 blockchain infrastructure provider, Toncoin, was up more than 5%. Toncoin has spiked since last week when the messaging app Telegram announced that it would integrate the TON network into its app.\n\nCryptocurrencies veered slightly from equity markets, which were flat. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 0.10%, while the S&P 500 was even more slightly in negative territory.\n\nWhat\u2019s to Come\n\nInvestors will be closely watching the Federal Reserve\u2019s next monetary policy meeting, which begins Tuesday. The CME Federal Funds Rate tool, a widely watched predictor of Federal Reserve monetary policy, now forecasts a 99% probability that the bank will not raise interest rates, although many Fed observers believe it will return to rate hikes later this year, given inflation\u2019s stubbornness. The Consumer Price and Producer Price Indexes for August took disappointing turns upward earlier this month after months of decline. The 3.7% CPI was higher than the previous month\u2019s 3% reading and well outside the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n\nStill, in comments to Unchained, Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of digital asset manager BitBull Capital, struck a hopeful tone, suggesting that bitcoin could rise in the weeks ahead.\n\n\u201cAlthough the resistance at $27K led to sell-off pressure, pushing prices just below, we believe the consolidation in the last week to just under this level has brought strength and support and could lead to a breakout past $27.5K in the near future.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOther assets, including Ethereum and Solana, saw similar movements. As the assets continue to gain support at their current levels, we expect further testing of resistance lines and fewer sell-offs as they pass through those lines.\u201d"

        "content": "Cuba, a country known for its unique blend of rich history, vibrant culture and political isolation, is the focus of Cointelegraph\u2019s latest on-the-ground documentary. The Truth Behind Cuba\u2019s Bitcoin Revolution explores Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) impact in one of the world\u2019s last remaining communist states.\n\nThe documentary provides a firsthand account of how Cubans are using Bitcoin to navigate challenging economic circumstances, attract new businesses and save money in a censorship-heavy environment.\n\nJournalist and Bitcoin enthusiast Joe Hall embarked on the journey to Cuba, determined to witness and capture the \u201cBitcoin revolution\u201d that gained prominence in Alex Gladstein\u2019s book Check Your Financial Privilege. Gladstein explains how Cubans have harnessed Bitcoin\u2019s stateless, low-fee nature to escape financial oppression and secure their savings.\n\nThe documentary explores how Bitcoin has taken root in the Cuban financial landscape, brought to life through interviews and interactions with Cubans, as well as the co-founders of the \u201cCuba Bitcoin\u201d community \u2014 Forte, Catrya and Bitalion (not their real names). Paco de la India, a regular Cointelegraph contributor, traveled with Hall and provides feedback and commentary throughout the documentary.\n\nBitcoin users in Cuba primarily engage in peer-to-peer transactions, buying and selling Bitcoin through Telegram and Signal groups. They run nodes with limited resources and evade online surveillance and access banned internet sites with VPNs.\n\nUnlike many countries, Cuba is devoid of centralized crypto exchanges such as Coinbase or Binance. Plus, Cubans are banned from creating accounts due to the country\u2019s poor diplomatic relations with the United States.\n\nConsequently, the environment for Bitcoin in Cuba is a unique ecosystem that operates almost entirely outside of the reach of the state. Moreover, the resilient Bitcoin community is set against a backdrop of economic hardship. Seventy-two percent of Cubans live below the poverty line, and while the minimum monthly wage is approximately $30, Catrya \u2014 one of the documentary\u2019s main characters \u2014 explains that it is closer to $13.\n\nReporter Joe Hall, Paco de la India and only $200 in Cuban peso bills.\n\nCuba\u2019s economic hardships are exacerbated by hyperinflation, with the Cuban peso losing more than 940% of its value in the last two years. Through testimonials and interviews with Cubans across Havana, it\u2019s clear that Bitcoin has emerged as a lifeline for those looking to protect their savings from currency devaluation.\n\nRelated: Cuba Bitcoin community hosts BTC-only meetup\n\nThe documentary captures the grassroots adoption of Bitcoin in Cuba. It also highlights the efforts of the humble Cuba Bitcoin community, who spend their time educating and propagating the principles of Bitcoin to Cubans in an environment where the consequences of their actions are uncertain.\n\nUltimately, as Bitcoin continues to gain traction in Cuba, it remains to be seen how the government will react to the emergence of a parallel financial system. The Truth Behind Cuba\u2019s Bitcoin Revolution provides a rare glimpse into a nation on the cusp of transformative change. Bitcoin could offer Cubans a glimmer of hope and freedom on an island where such aspirations have been long suppressed.\n\nMagazine: \u2018Elegant and ass-backward\u2019: Jameson Lopp\u2019s first impression of Bitcoin"

        "content": "Bitcoin dipped on Monday morning in Asia to trade at around US$26,500. Ether also moved lower but stayed above its US$1,600 support level. Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies dropped, with Toncoin leading the losers with a slide of over 4%. Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX received court approval last week to sell its crypto holdings of around US$3.4 billion, which could add to the selling pressure in the crypto market \u2014 especially altcoins \u2014 for the rest of the year. U.S. stock futures edged up as investors await the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision this week. Wall Street closed lower on Friday, as mixed economic data in the U.S. moderated the investor\u2019s risk appetite.\n\nBitcoin, Ether dip; selling pressure from FTX liquidation\n\nBitcoin edged down 0.18% in the last 24 hours to US$26,492.52 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong and went up 2.60% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reached US$26,840.50 on Friday, the highest price since August 17.\n\nEther dipped 0.87% to US$1,619.94 and traded flat for the week with a 0.18% uptick.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies booked losses in the past 24 hours. Binance\u2019s BNB token was the only exception, rising 0.66% to US$216.23 while adding 1.80% for the week.\n\nDespite the uptick in BNB prices, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange faces mounting regulatory challenges. The firm\u2019s U.S. affiliate Binance.US has laid off one-third of its staff and saw its Chief Executive Officer Brian Shroder leave the company last week, citing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) \u201caggressive attempts to cripple\u201d the crypto industry. The exchange also lost its legal and risk executives last week, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe crypto market is facing pressure from the liquidation of FTX, which plans to sell its US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets by the end of 2023. The bankrupt exchange\u2019s top three crypto holdings are Solana (US$1.162 million), Bitcoin (US$560 million) and Ether (US$192 million).\n\nStory continues\n\nFTX said it will gradually sell the holdings with a US$100 million weekly cap to avoid a negative impact on crypto prices, but this limit could expand to US$200 million upon approval from two committees representing FTX customers.\n\n\u201cSales of this size are destined to have an impact,\u201d wrote blockchain research firm K33 on Friday. \u201cEspecially altcoins with limited liquidity are exposed, making it vital for altcoin traders to maintain comprehensive oversight of FTX\u2019s holdings.\u201d\n\nThe ongoing Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the U.S. could also be contributing to the underperformance of altcoins, said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cThis is probably led by investors betting on ETFs becoming a thing -at some point in the future \u2014 and not wanting to miss out. Conversely, altcoins that are still at risk of being labelled as \u2018securities\u2019 aren\u2019t benefitting from the same enthusiasm,\u201d said d\u2019Anethan.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.73% in the past 24 hours to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume dropped 12.08% to US$17.53 billion.\n\nU.S. equities futures rise ahead of Fed meeting\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell|Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures moved up as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, after Wall Street closed lower on Friday, with Nasdaq Composite leading the losers with a 1.56% slide. The three major U.S. indexes closed the week mixed, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq booking losses while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging up 0.12%.\n\nMost main stock indexes in Asia went lower on Monday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s Kospi all logged losses, while Japan\u2019s stock market is closed due to a public holiday and will return on Tuesday.\n\nWall Street\u2019s Friday slide was spearheaded by major tech corporations including Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Corp. and Adobe Inc., which all closed the day over 3.5% lower.\n\nTechnology\u2019s\u2019 slide coincided with a Reuters report on Friday stating that TSMC, a Taiwan-based semiconductor manufacturer that provides chips to companies like Apple, had told its suppliers to delay delivery of high-end chip-making equipment due to concerns over customer demand.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. economic data on Friday sent mixed messages to the market. The U.S. industrial production rose 0.4% by month in August. Although the reading was held back by a 5% drop in the output of motor vehicles and parts, it still beat the analysts\u2019 expectation of 0.1%.\n\nThe rebound in industrial production followed the August consumer price index (CPI) release last week that showed the core CPI \u2014 the Fed\u2019s favored inflation gauge \u2014 logged its smallest annual increase since September 2021.\n\n\u201cWe really continue to see that growth resilience story, and I think that\u2019s difficult for the market simply because there\u2019s concern about what that could mean both for rates and inflation,\u201d Lisa Erickson, head of public markets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in its meeting on Sept. 20, which is currently in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%. It gives a 73% chance for another pause in November, up from 63% on Friday.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed leaves interest rates unchanged, it is likely to have a positive impact on higher-risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. Steady interest rates can be indicators of stability, which could encourage investors to seek alternative assets like cryptocurrencies,\u201d said John Stefanidis, chief executive officer and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure decentralized organization Balthazar DAO.\n\nWith most analysts expecting a pause of rate hike in September, all eyes are now on Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s remark that will come with the rate hike decision on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWith last week\u2019s higher-than-expected inflation data and the ongoing rise in oil prices, Fed\n\nChair Powell could communicate a relatively hawkish message. However, based on our analysis, we would not expect the market to buy into this for much longer as the inflation trend is still lower,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed report.\n\nElsewhere, China\u2019s industrial production and retail sales logged an annual increase of 4.5% and 4.6% in August, both accelerating from the previous month and beating the analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the peak pessimism is behind us,\u201d Ding Shuang, chief economist for greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Plc., told Bloomberg on Friday. \u201cAugust\u2019s data indicates that the economy is unlikely to suffer from a persisting, deeper downturn going forward even though there might still be some volatility ahead \u2014 especially if we take into account the policy factor.\u201d\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "content": "After forming successive Doji candlestick patterns on the weekly chart for the past three weeks, Bitcoin (BTC) is on target to end the week on a positive note. This is an early sign that the uncertainty between the bulls and the bears is resolving to the upside.\n\nAlthough the recovery is still in its early stages, the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Sept. 20 could boost volatility. The majority of the market participants expect the Federal Reserve to maintain a status quo on rates, but surprises could arise during Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference following the rate decision.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recovery from the strong support near $24,800 has ignited buying interest in select altcoins, which are providing trading opportunities. For these altcoins to continue their upward trajectory, Bitcoin needs to maintain above $26,500.\n\nCould Bitcoin\u2019s relief rally pick up momentum, triggering buying in select altcoins? Let\u2019s study the charts of top-5 cryptocurrencies that are showing promise in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin rose above the 20-day exponential moving average ($26,303) on Sept. 14, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. Since then, the bulls thwarted several attempts by the bears to yank the price back below the 20-day EMA.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBuyers will try to build upon their advantage and drive the BTC/USDT pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($27,295). This level may act as a minor hurdle but if overcome, the pair is likely to reach $28,143. The bears are expected to defend this level with vigor.\n\nIf bears want to maintain the upper hand, they will have to sink the price below the 20-day EMA. That may trap the aggressive bulls and open the doors for a potential retest of the pivotal support at $24,800.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has been trading above the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart indicating that the bulls are buying on dips. This suggests that the traders expect the recovery to continue. If buyers clear the hurdle at $26,900, the pair may climb to $27,600 and eventually to $28,143.\n\nIf bears want to make a comeback, they will have to sink and sustain the price below the 20-EMA. Such a move will clear the path for a further fall to the 50-SMA and later to the strong support zone between $25,600 and $25,300.\n\nMaker price analysis\n\nBuyers propelled Maker (MKR) above the 50-day SMA ($1,162) on Sept. 15, indicating that the bulls are attempting to take charge.\n\nMKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe MKR/USDT pair is on its way to $1,370. This level is likely to witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. If the bulls do not give up much ground from this level, the likelihood of a break above it increases. If that happens, the pair could pick up momentum and dash toward $1,759.\n\nThe crucial level to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($1,162). If this level cracks, it will suggest that the pair may swing inside the large range between $980 and $1,370 for some time.\n\nMKR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bulls remain in command, but the RSI near the overbought territory suggests a minor correction or consolidation in the near term. The 20-EMA remains the key level to watch on the downside. A break and close below it could indicate the start of a deeper correction toward the 50-SMA.\n\nInstead, if the price bounces off the 20-EMA, it will be a sign that the bulls continue to buy the dips. That may start a rally toward the stiff overhead resistance at $1,370.\n\nAave price analysis\n\nAave (AAVE) surged above the moving averages on Sept. 16, indicating that the bulls have made their move. However, the long wick on the day\u2019s candlestick shows selling at higher levels.\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart.

If they succeed, the AAVE/USDT pair is likely to accelerate toward $70 and later to $76.\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($56) is the important support to keep an eye on in the near term.

If the price turns down sharply from $2, it will indicate that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could tug the price down to the 20-day EMA ($1.62).\n\nContrarily, if the RUNE/USDT pair does not give up much ground from the current level, it will suggest that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate the rally to extend further.

If they manage to do that, the pair may soar toward $2.30.\n\nThe first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-EMA. That could tempt several short-term traders to book profits.

That could start a stronger recovery to $1.83 and then to $2.20.\n\nThis positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price continues lower and breaks below the moving averages.

        "content": "Widely followed on-chain analyst Willy Woo says there\u2019s one thing making him worried about the future of Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nIn a new interview with Peter McCormack at a live What Bitcoin Did discussion, Woo says he\u2019s concerned about the growing \u201cfinancialization\u201d of Bitcoin through the various derivative products being launched that he says have the ability to manipulate price and take liquidity away from BTC.\n\nAccording to Woo, Bitcoin\u2019s Sharpe Ratio metric, which aims to compare the return of an investment with its risk, has slowly declined ever since 2019 when BTC derivatives started popping up.\n\n\u201cBitcoin was killing it. It beat every other asset on the planet. It was like three to four [on the Shape Ratio], that\u2019s very high. Now it\u2019s dropped down to around twoish, something like that\u2026\n\nWhere we are right now is actually converging onto every other macro asset on the planet, similar to equities, similar to gold, bonds, and emerging currencies. It\u2019s like all macro assets trade within a range, and Bitcoin is just into that\u2026\n\nThat happened in 2018-2019. And the question is what happened in 2018-2019? It was the financialization of Bitcoin. We had the perpetual swap, we had calendar futures, paperization of Bitcoin. Say I\u2019m the US government and I\u2019ve got $20 trillion of capital out there \u2013 M2 money supply \u2013 you can make policy, you can print more money, you can incentivize particular markets.\n\nAnd the reality is Bitcoin\u2019s maybe a half a trillion dollar asset. There are 21 million Bitcoins associated with that. If I print $1 trillion, I can sell $42 trillion in Bitcoin. So that\u2019s the issue right now is, we\u2019ve got the paperization of these markets and Bitcoin is traded like any other macro asset on the planet. I think that\u2019s a big worry for me.\n\nWoo says the likely approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) may come with the catch of larger entities being able to influence price.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a spot ETF, okay we can buy up to 21 million \u2013 well actually 1 million because that\u2019s what\u2019s available \u2013 but in the meantime you\u2019ve got these paper markets that have this huge ability to control the market.\u201d\n\nO\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nCheck Price Action\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nSurf The Daily Hodl Mix\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "title": "Bitcoin Dominance Back Above 50% as Altcoins Struggle - U.Today",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBitcoin is back in the spotlight. Currently priced at $26,684, the flagship cryptocurrency now accounts for over 50% of the total crypto market, with a market cap of approximately $520 billion. The milestone is particularly significant as it comes at a time when many alternative cryptocurrencies, commonly referred to as altcoins, are experiencing stagnation or decline. Despite regaining dominance, Bitcoin's position is still down 4.5% from its June high and 22.5% from its peak in January 2022.\n\nAltcoins struggle to keep up\n\nAltcoins like Ethereum, BNB and XRP are lagging behind in performance compared to Bitcoin. Ethereum, the closest competitor, is currently priced at $1,632.09, down 0.1% in the past hour and only up 1.1% over the last week. Similar trends are apparent on other altcoins; BNB is up just 2.4% over the week, while XRP has declined by 0.4%.\n\nSome lesser-known coins like Toncoin have shown dramatic price swings, but they occupy a much smaller slice of the market. The underwhelming performance of these alternative cryptocurrencies has contributed to Bitcoin's recent increase in market dominance.\n\nHistorical trends\n\nBitcoin's regained market dominance aligns with historical trends, including its tendency to spike during bear markets. Bitcoin remains the pioneer and the most well-known crypto asset, and its market share has fluctuated over time, especially during periods of altcoin surges.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has often gained ground in bearish climates, serving as a sort of digital \"safe haven\" for investors. Despite the current upward trend, it is crucial to note that Bitcoin's dominance is still far from its peak levels as it is down from both its June high of 52% and the bull market zenith it reached in December 2020 of 73%.\n\nHowever, there might still be room for growth. Analyst Benjamin Cowen tweeted, \"You know what would look better than 50% #BTC dominance? 60% BTC dominance.\""

        "title": "How to Earn Bitcoin by Playing Minecraft - Decrypt",
        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nUPDATE: Satlantis has announced that the Bitcoin play-to-earn functionality will be removed from its Minecraft server on September 25 following a demand from Minecraft creator Mojang. The feature violates the game's recently updated usage guidelines. Read the full report. The following guide will no longer be accurate as of that date.\n\nORIGINAL STORY: Did you know you can earn Bitcoin by playing Minecraft?\n\nSatlantis, a Minecraft server, lets users earn Bitcoin while they play. Players can enter a virtual mining pool that pays out real satoshis (sats) to players every 10 minutes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA satoshi is the smallest unit of measurement for Bitcoin, with each Bitcoin containing 100 million satoshis. According to Zebedee, which created the tech to power the third-party server, over 1 million satoshis (nearly $300) is given out every week.\n\nHow do you get involved? How does it work? And how much can you really earn? We spent numerous hours in-game to help you get started\u2014both in text and via the video walkthrough below.\n\nHow do you earn Bitcoin in Minecraft?\n\nSatlantis is a Minecraft server that is accessible via Minecraft: Java Edition on computers. The server IP is play.satlantis.net.\n\nAnyone can hop onto Satlantis and play, but to earn Bitcoin, you must get a virtual ASIC miner\u2014the type of miner needed to mine Bitcoin in real life, too\u2014and then fuel it with emeralds. This will increase your hashrate (seen on the right side of the screen), which will then enter you into a raffle every 10 minutes to win a sliver of Bitcoin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe lowest-tier ASIC miner adds 10 to your hashrate, but you can get an ASIC miner that produces up to 45 hashrate for you.\n\nImage: Decrypt\n\nTo calculate your chances of winning, divide your hashrate by the global hashrate shown on-screen, and then multiply by 100. During our short time playing, we managed to get a maximum of 30 hashrate with a global hashrate of 52,630. This means that we had a 0.057% chance of winning Bitcoin, every 10 minutes.\n\nYou can also join a clan to combine your hashrate with the other members. This improves your chances at winning more consistently, with the earnings being split between members based on how much they contributed to the group's hashrate.\n\nWhile ASIC miners are the primary way of earning sats in-game, you can also trade your way to some Bitcoin. There is a marketplace available where users will sell items as menial as dirt or as rare as elytras\u2014this is where we got our ASIC miners!\n\nImage: Decrypt\n\nDon't get fooled by the marketplace price tags, though! What looks like $2,000 actually means 2,000 sats\u2014which is currently just over $0.50.\n\nHow do I get an ASIC miner in Satlantis?\n\nThere are two ways to get ASIC miners in Satlantis: through the battle pass or the marketplace.\n\nThe battle pass, which you can access by typing \u201c/bp\u201d into the in-game chat, is available on free and paid tiers. In season 3, the current season as of this writing, you have to get to level 51 on the free battle pass before you get an \"Elliptic Key,\" which allows you to get an ASIC miner via an \"Elliptic Crate.\u201d\n\nIf 51 tiers of a free battle pass seems a bit too intense for you, the premium battle pass gives you an Elliptic Key at level 10. A premium battle pass costs $40 via Stripe, or 120,000 satoshis\u2014approximately $33 as of this writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn order to level up the battle pass, you really have to actively work at it\u2014your quests are rarely completed as a byproduct of playing normally. There are fun quests, such as a \"Where's Waldo?\" task where you must find Waldo hidden somewhere in the world. But there are also more grindy quests, like \"Deal 10,000 points of damage to a player.\u201d\n\nImage: Decrypt\n\nAfter playing for a while, we decided to cut this corner and buy some ASIC miners directly from the marketplace.\n\nFirst we had to get money onto Satlantis. This is done by typing \u201c/deposit\u201d and sending Bitcoin via the Lightning Network to the address shown on-screen via a QR code. We loaded on $9, which gave us 32,999 SATs, and bought three virtual ASIC s10 miners for 29,000 SATs.\n\nHow do you fuel the ASICs?\n\nIn order for your ASIC miner to produce a hashrate, it must be fueled with an emerald. You do not need to be logged on to produce hashrate or collect rewards, so the game can run in the background while you're doing other stuff on your PC.\n\nThe maximum amount of emeralds you can put in an ASIC miner is 64 per fuel slot. This only increases the amount of time that your ASIC miner will produce hashrate\u2014this was 18 hours, three minutes, and 20 seconds for our s10 miner.\n\nIt's important to note that you do not obtain emeralds the same way you would in vanilla Minecraft. Instead, there are traders in the lobby that will exchange ores and sugar cane for emeralds.\n\nImage: Decrypt\n\nWith exchange rates like 32 diamonds for 16 emeralds, you'll be forgiven for thinking that securing stacks of 64 emeralds is unattainable. But you'd be wrong.\n\nBy entering \u201c/mines\u201d in the chat, you'll be teleported to a crazy mine system with an abundance of every ore you'll need. In these mines, I managed to get two stacks of 64 diamonds within 20 minutes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou can take things to the next level by entering the diamond mines. To get there. you must complete an incredibly challenging parkour course. If you want to make things easier for yourself, then purchase an elytra (a set of wings) and fly down\u2014we eventually did this.\n\nOnce down there, you'll find lots of mushrooms (great to make mushroom soup), mobs (aka enemy creatures, to complete quests), and Poseidon's tomb.\n\nImage: Decrypt\n\nIn this tomb, there's an incredible amount of ores to mine. It can be slightly overwhelming when you first enter, but it\u2019s not all smooth sailing as you'll have to defend yourself against mobs.\n\nHow much can you earn?\n\nOver four days of sporadically playing on the Satlantis server, we managed to keep our three ASIC s10 miners running for about 41 hours in total.\n\nFor the vast majority of that span, we\u2019d earned zero Bitcoin. We were onto our last hour of fuel with the game running in the background when suddenly we won the raffle.\n\nWe earned 16,034 sats during our time on the server. This is just over $4 as of this writing, meaning we are nearly halfway to earning our initial investment back.\n\nHow do you withdraw Bitcoin from Satlantis?\n\nOnce you're ready to cash out, simply type \u201c/withdraw\u201d followed by the amount you want to withdraw. Next, you'll be asked to enter your Lightning Network address. Once you've done this, you\u2019ll need to wait up to 48 hours for the transaction to process.\n\nThe Satlantis server is an intriguing way for gamers to earn Bitcoin while playing one of the most popular games of all time. It can be difficult to get started, but the guide above should help you get your bearings\u2014and don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions in the server\u2019s Discord or in-game chat, as the community appears to be very supportive of newcomers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to add detail on how clans work in Satlantis."

        "content": "Advertisement\n\nFounder of market analysis, consulting and asset management firm Quantum Economics Mati Greenspan says farewell to the correlation between the performance of the largest cryptocurrency and top stocks of public companies.\n\n\"No longer a couple\": Top analyst Greenspan on Bitcoin (BTC) and stocks\n\nBitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency asset by market capitalization, and SPX500, a market value-weighted index that tracks the prices of 500 large stocks traded on the U.S. market, stopped showing signs of notable correlation between each other. Prominent analyst and investor Mati Greenspan shared this take in social media today, Sept. 18, 2023.\n\nHe illustrated this take with a chart from CoinMetrics, a major blockchain data research platform. It demonstrates that the correlation between the two values has been plummeting since early 2023.\n\nSo far, it is the largest decline of this metric since the 2018-2019 bear market peak. The Bitcoin/SPX500 correlation printed an all-time high at 0.7 in Q1, 2022.\n\nIn the early years of Bitcoin's (BTC) history, the correlation was mostly negative, as BTC was not mature enough. At the same time, during the 2020 crisis, the correlation started growing.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin (BTC) is still correlated to Nikkei 225, a Japanese version of SPX500, as reported by U.Today previously.\n\nBear market phenomena?\n\nAlso, in June 2023, Bitcoin (BTC) lost its correlation with gold. The assets share a reputation as hedge instruments against increased market volatility.\n\nGreenspan avoided indicating the root causes of such an impressive \"decoupling.\" However, he hinted that it might be associated with the painful phase of bearish recession for Bitcoin (BTC):\n\nCall it a bear market phenomena or whatever you want. Data from CoinMetrics shows that BTC and the SPX500 are no longer a couple. We wish them a happy break up!\n\nAlso, analyst PlanB opined today that the market is in an accumulation phase, the last depressive one before the start of a new bullish rally. He expects it to come in 2024-2025, as U.Today covered earlier today."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nFollowing weeks of debate about Bitcoin drivechains, a similar project to unlock the network\u2019s programming potential is picking up steam.\n\nOn Monday, Jameson Lopp\u2014co-founder and CTO of mobile self-custody firm Casa\u2014published a blog post about \u201cSpiderchain,\u201d which he called \u201cyet another proposal for building 2-way pegged sidechains.\u201d\n\nA sidechain is a separate blockchain that is tied into the main Bitcoin network in some way. They typically use the same native currency\u2014BTC\u2014and may also leverage Bitcoin\u2019s security guarantees. Sidechains let Bitcoiners access more features with their BTC that the main network can\u2019t always provide, such as scalability, programmability, and privacy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA prevailing difficulty with sidechains, however, is building a \u201c2-way peg\u201d allowing BTC to be safely transferred to the sidechain and back without requiring a centralized middleman.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Spiderchain, developed by Botanix Labs, comes into play.\n\n\u201cThe Spiderchain works as a Proof of Stake Layer 2 on Bitcoin,\u201d Willem Schro\u00e9, founder of Botanix Labs, told Decrypt. \u201cYou stake Bitcoin on Bitcoin in decentralized multisigs.\u201d\n\n\n\nEntities that manage decentralized multisigs are called \u201corchestrators,\u201d who run both a Bitcoin node and a Spiderchain node. With every request to move BTC to the Spiderchain, a new multisig is created that\u2019s controlled by a random subset of 100 participants within the staker set.\n\nIn many ways, the Spiderchain operates much like Ethereum: it is Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible, has 12-second block times, and uses a proof of stake consensus mechanism to secure the network, whereby orchestrator nodes must stake BTC to participate.\n\nIts EVM is also \u201cfully equivalent,\u201d meaning existing Ethereum dapps can be easily transferred over to the network by developers. But unlike Ethereum, Schro\u00e9 said that a malicious majority of orchestrators still cannot conspire to steal users\u2019 BTC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe design is possible on the current Bitcoin core, so no soft fork or upgrade is needed,\u201d noted Schro\u00e9. This sets Spiderchain apart from Paul Sztorc\u2019s drivechain proposal, which requires changing the Bitcoin code that users and miners are currently running.\n\n\n\nDrivechain was introduced as BIP 300 and BIP 301 back in 2015, and is still yet to be widely embraced for implementation by Bitcoiners.\n\nDrivechains effectively put control of pegged BTC into the hands of Bitcoin miners, but allow for any number of sidechains with any number of properties to be created. It also directly inherits Bitcoin\u2019s security through merge mining, which piggybacks on the main network\u2019s immense proof of work security.\n\nWhen asked about Spiderchains, Sztorc said they seem \u201cvery complex\u201d compared to his proposal.\n\n\u201cI also think that the whole \"needs a change to Bitcoin\" is pure superstition, unfortunately,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople think it means 'the network' must upgrade, but really it is like asking users to install an app on their phone.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Lopp\u2019s Monday blog post, the CTO cited the nearly decade-old Rootstock proposal, and pointed out some technical vulnerabilities with Spiderchain. Among them is the risk that its BTC peg is \u201cbroken\u201d if the main Bitcoin blockchain experiences a reorg of longer than five blocks, due to the system by which Spiderchain orchestrators are determined.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt would be unlikely to be catastrophic due to how the funds are dispersed across many multi-sig wallets,\u201d he noted.\n\n\n\nSchro\u00e9 also admitted that in the network\u2019s early stages, Spiderchain will be centralized until more users can come in to stake their BTC. \u201cWe need to start off centralized in the sense that initially we will have to make the staking permissioned,\u201d he said."

Clever bit of tech helps you find your lost car in a parking lot\n\nThe German-born programmer living in San Francisco was left with just two guesses to figure out the decade-old password keeping his Bitcoin fortune safe.\n\nThis story starts back in 2011 when Thomas uploaded a video to YouTube titled \u201cWhat is Bitcoin? (v1)\u201d.\n\nThe short clip, just over a minute in length, was made for a Bitcoin enthusiast based in Switzerland.\n\nFor his trouble, Thomas was paid in Bitcoin as compensation \u2013 7,002 Bitcoins to be precise.\n\njustmoon / X\n\nNow, if you\u2019re familiar with Bitcoin, you\u2019ll likely know they were only worth a measly $2 each back then.\n\nThat said, $14,004 isn\u2019t to be sniffed at for a minute-long animation video.\n\nThe value of those same coins skyrocketed in value and it wasn\u2019t long before each coin was worth around $34,500, meaning his collection was now worth a staggering $241,569,000.\n\nAnd while it sounds like a dream, it actually turned out to be a nightmare for Thomas.\n\njustmoon / X\n\nThomas couldn\u2019t remember his encrypted IronKey hard drive password where he kept his Bitcoin.\n\nTo add insult to injury, he\u2019d written the password on a piece of paper to avoid a situation like this, but he\u2019d misplaced it.\n\nThe hard drive isn\u2019t your average bit of tech either, as it only gives you 10 guesses to figure out the password before it encrypts itself and you\u2019re locked out.\n\nThomas had a go at trying to guess the password eight times, but none of his attempts were successful.\n\nThat meant he had just two guesses left before his fortune was lost forever.\n\nUnderstandly, the whole order affected his mental health, with Thomas admitting he couldn\u2019t sleep and even suffered from depression.\n\nFor now, Thomas has locked his IronKey in a secure facility \u2013 just in case.\n\nFingers crossed one day he has a brainwave and remembers the password to his $240 million fortune."

        "content": "In this week\u2019s edition of the top performing ETFs, both bitcoin and uranium ETFs led based on one-week returns. Other metals-focused ETFs like those focused on silver also did well, with a single decarbonization-focused strategy also making an appearance. Both metals and bitcoin strategies play in different overall spaces and trends, but could both owe their returns to defensively-minded investors.\n\nUranium ETFs took four of the 12 total places in the top ranks, but two of those were the top two. The Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM) and the Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ) returned 9.5% and 9.4%, respectively. The duo saw the VanEck Uranium+Nuclear Energy ETF (NLR) and the Global X Uranium ETF (URA) join them in the top rankings. URNM has returned a staggering 41.1% year to date and 44.5% over three years, charging 83 basis points.\n\nUnderstanding Uranium ETFs\n\nThe strategies may be benefiting from global uranium demand growing as nations turn their energy systems toward renewable, nuclear power. Nuclear power may also be seeing increased interest, with winter on the horizon for the northern hemisphere. Silver ETFs also performed well for the week, taking two of the top 12 positions.\n\nBitcoin strategies also did well over the last week per Logicly data. Three of the top 12 ETFs focus on bitcoin, including the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBTF), and the Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITS). Bitcoin has seen some slight progress on the path toward a possible spot product given recent court decisions, though returns may also owe to cryptocurrency being seen as a diversification play.\n\nFinally, the Subversive Decarbonziation ETF (DKRB) deserves a mention. The fund finished fourth for the week, returning 7.5% in that time. Having just launched in December, it actively invests in firms focused on decarbonization efforts for a 75 basis point fee. Overall, commodities strategies, whether in metal or crypto, led the way for the week.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_536801\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"648\"] Uranium ETFs as well as bitcoin and silver funds led over the last week per Logicly.[/caption]\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Gold/Silver/Critical Materials Channel .\n\nVisualizations and data provided by LOGICLY, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of VettaFi.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

The remittance token has been a popular topic since Ripple secured a victory in court against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when Judge Annalisa Torres determined that XRP is a security only when sold to institutional clients. The ruling, though only partial, provided some level of clarity for the payments token.\n\nAlso Read: Ripple records landmark win against the SEC as court rules XRP is not a security except...\n\nXRP may be the next Bitcoin\n\nRipple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse says XRP could be the next Bitcoin, as it has a strong competitive edge over its peers in the crypto sector. Specifically, he says, \u201cFrom the get-go, Ripple has worked with regulators and regulated institutions like banks,\u201d In his opinion, the digital asset\u2019s exposure to a space where there is no regulatory uncertainty, such as the traditional finance sector (TradFi) is in itself a competitive advantage, increasing the chances of the token\u2019s success long term.\n\nAs such, Garlinghouse articulates that with XRP at the core of what Ripple wants to do, it is working to solve some of the original problems that Bitcoin (BTC) set out to solve, which is expected to map out the next generation of digital assets. It comes as RippleNet takes on the SWIFT messaging system in an innovative attempt to solve the nature of a payment taking days to settle instead of seconds.\n\nThe innovation currently boasts over 100 customers, according to Garlinghouse, \u201cranging from some of the biggest banks in the world to payment providers, to the Western Union and MoneyGram,\u201d among others, with Garlinghouse noting that they are signing up more than a bank every week.\n\nDecrease in cost, increase in speed\n\nThe allure of XRP, like XLM, is that countries use it for cross-border payments, unlike tokens used to manipulate the market. Garlinghouse notes that XRP is at the helm of digital asset maturity, providing real value to customers by solving real problems. More broadly, he says, \u201cXRP is 1000X faster than Bitcoin, which means the volatility risk taken around XRP is only for three seconds.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock rumors of shifted focus from Bitcoin to XRP fail to deflate BTC Spot ETF flare."

        "title": "Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? BTC Climbs Above $27,000 - NewsBTC",
        "content": "The Bitcoin price is sustaining its bullish momentum from the previous day. Today, it surpassed the $27,000 threshold, a level not seen since August 31. Notably, BTC recorded its first green weekly closing candle in five weeks yesterday. As of press time, the Bitcoin price has reached an intra-day high of $27,267.\n\nWhy Is Bitcoin Price Up Today?\n\nOne major indicator that has captured analysts\u2019 attention is the rapid increase in Open Interest. DaanCrypto, a noted figure in the crypto space, commented on the Open Interest of Bitcoin: \u201cBitcoin Open Interest has been ramping up like crazy these past few hours. Up +$850M in hours.\u201d According to him, this can be an issue if spot bid disappears which could cause for a full retrace similar to before.\n\n\u201cThis would then be due to underwater positions that entered near the top. If spot bid remains then these positions are obviously fine. Open Interest is now back to post Grayscale pump levels,\u201d Daan stated, further noting the resilience in the spot premium at the moment, \u201cLongs are comfy as long as spot bid is present.\u201d\n\nMaartuun, the community manager at CryptoQuant Netherlands, also highlights the rapid surge in Open Interest: \u201cFasten your seat belts. The Open Interest goes bonkers on this break-out attempt. It has increased by $600 million (7%).\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Coinglass data reveals that as of press time, short liquidations for BTC remain modest, with just about $20 million in shorts being liquidated. At press time, OI skyrocketed further, up almost $1 billion (from $11.04 to $12.03 billion).\n\nRenowned analyst @52kskew emphasized the trading behavior on Binance: \u201cMajority chasing shorts aggressively from what I can see so far. Binance Open Interest: Binance perp OI starting to moon again with minimal price difference ~ big move brewing. OI up and insignificant change in perp delta (positions opening into price). Takers still aggressively selling into price, bulls want to see constant limit chasing on the bid here. $26.7K pivotal price for direction.\u201d\n\nAli Martinez, another analyst, pointed towards Bitcoin\u2019s 3-day chart and noted a buy signal by the TD Sequential yesterday. \u201cA boost in $BTC buying pressure might drive prices to the channel\u2019s mid or upper boundary \u2013 targeting $28,000 or $31,000. Still, watch the TD Risk Line at $24,500. It\u2019s the key invalidation point.\u201d\n\nFrom macro perspective, renowned analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) indicated a correlation between USD liquidity and Bitcoin price movements: \u201cIf you can track/forecast USD liquidity, you\u2019ll have a solid idea of where price is headed.\u201d He went on to highlight a divergence between the rise in USD liquidity and the previous stagnation of BTC, emphasizing the recent shift which might be driven by returning liquidity.\n\nMonthly Close Will Be Crucial\n\nAs NewsBTC reported, September is historically one of the worst months of the year for the Bitcoin price. However, this year could be different if BTC continues its trend of the last few days.\n\nRekt Capital highlighted the potential significance of the upcoming monthly candle close for Bitcoin in a recent tweet, stating: \u201cThe upcoming Monthly Candle Close will be pivotal.\u201d According to the analyst, Bitcoin often produces long upward wicks when it transforms old Monthly supports into new resistances.\n\nIn simple terms, an upward wick on a candlestick chart indicates price levels where Bitcoin traded during a period but didn\u2019t close. A long wick suggests a strong rejection from those higher price levels. This could mean that while buyers tried to push the price up during the month, by the close, sellers had brought it back down, leaving a long \u2018wick\u2019 on the candlestick.\n\nRekt Capital suggests that these wicks can extend up to +8% beyond the candle body. The analyst notes that if the monthly candle close produces an upside wick of +7% beyond the ~$27,100 level, it could mean the price might go beyond the weekly lower high.\n\nThis could be a positive sign if the monthly close remains above $27,100, indicating it as a support level. However, if the price closes the month below $27,100 after reaching higher levels, it may confirm $27,100 as a new resistance, hinting that the recent price movement might be just a temporary upward rally.\n\nAt press time, BTC stood at $27,241.\n\nFeatured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin is poised to snap a four-week decline, but analysts are questioning how long the rally will last.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market value has gained about 2% since last Sunday to around $26,358.\n\n\u201cThe crypto bulls badly needed a bounce this week,\u201d said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak Co. \u201cThings were looking bleak as the week started, so the bounce has provided some very important relief.\u201d\n\nThe possibility of a weekly gain comes as Bitcoin rebuilds its correlation with technology stocks, mirroring the price moves of the Nasdaq 100 Index as it climbed earlier this week. However, the tech-heavy index is on track to be flat to modestly negative for the week as declines in Amazon.com Inc. and Nvidia Corp. drag it lower on Friday. With investors getting ready to parse a bevy of economic data and the Federal Reserve's rate decision next week, it's unclear how stocks will perform going forward.\n\nWill Tamplin, senior analyst at Fairlead Strategies, says it's prudent to not be overly optimistic about the recent gains in Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cOur short-term momentum indicators show improvement, but we are cautious regarding the sustainability of a rally since intermediate-term has deteriorated in recent weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Bitcoin can clear its 50-day moving average, currently near $27,400, it would increase our confidence in a short-term rebound.\u201d\n\nRead More: Bitcoin Is Getting Back to Trading in Tandem With Tech Stocks\n\nThe level investors are now watching on Bitcoin is $28,800.\n\nAny break below that level \u2014 Bitcoin's low in both June and September \u2014 could lead a lot of investors to give up on the digital asset, according to Maley.\n\n\u201cThat $28,800 level is now the \u2018line in the sand' for the Bitcoin bulls,\u201d he said."

        "content": "Need for knowledge\n\nBENGALURU: The government has released Rs 50 lakh under the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements (KTPP) Act to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Criminal Investigation Department formed to reinvestigate the Bitcoin case . This comes over two years after Bengaluru police clarified to a local court that they had not recovered 31 Bitcoins from hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki and that he had misled the interrogators by showing them a live wallet of a Bitcoin exchange.Police said the fund would be of great help in getting the support from experts that\u2019s required to probe the scandal that is not only a hitech crime but has international dimensions.Sriki was arrested by police in November 2020 on alleged charges of purchasing drugs from darknet using Bitcoins. Prior to his arrest, cops had arrested his associates and recovered 500 grams of marijuana from them. No cash was recovered either from Sriki or his associates.In January 2021, Sandeep Patil, then joint commissioner of police, Central Crime Branch, had announced that no Bitcoins had been transferred from Sriki's account, nor were any Bitcoins lost.\u201cAfter Sriki told us that his wallet had 31 Bitcoins, we decided to open an account for further investigation. We had taken permission from the government in January. During the investigation, cyber experts had found that the Bitcoin account, claimed to be opened by Sriki, was a live wallet of an exchange and he did not have a private key to it. The wallet was untouched and no Bitcoins were transferred to the police wallet,\u201d Sandeep Patil claimed. A report to this effect was also attached in the chargesheet against Sriki, running into 800 pages, and filed by then investigating officer Chandradhar.After the Congress government formed the SIT in July, an official filed an FIR last month against the then CCB officials and others in the case, claiming that electronic gadgets of Sriki were tampered with by addition of more files during the investigation.Now, with the government sanctioning Rs 50 lakh, SIT officials are ready to hire experts in cyber-forensic field and Bitcoins. \u201cThe probe demands deep knowledge of cybercrime as well as knowledge on Bitcoins. In this case, finding the roots of Bitcoins \u2014 from where they came and to where they went \u2014 are the most important factors. Once we begin the investigation, there will be unseen challenges for sure. Also, while tracking Bitcoin, we need to work with other countries. All these hurdles can be handled effectively if we are well equipped with experts,\u201d a senior officer said.Asked if any deadline is fixed to complete the probe, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll prefer completing it in reasonable time.\u201d"

        "title": "Pros and Cons of Using Bitcoin in Online Gambling - Analytics Insight",
        "content": "The past decade has seen a surge in the popularity of cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin emerging as the most popular cryptocurrency. Various businesses in the online space, including e-commerce and online casinos, are now allowing their customers and clients to transact with Bitcoin.\n\nSome of the best Bitcoin gambling sites offer numerous advantages over traditional gambling, including added privacy and faster transactions. But, like with most things, using Bitcoin for online gambling presents a few limitations.\n\nThis article will take an in-depth look at both sides of the coin \u2018pun intended\u2019 to give you a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and limitations of gambling with Bitcoin.\n\nPros\n\nEnhanced Privacy\n\n71% of adults worldwide have taken measures to improve their online privacy. While these efforts are mainly centred around using VPNs and privacy settings on their devices, some have gone a step further to secure their transactions by using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to make transactions.\n\nTraditional fiat currency transactions have one major flaw \u2013 they require you to share much personal information. Whenever you make a transaction, various institutions, from your credit card company to third-party payment processors and gambling sites, have access to your data.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, provides an unprecedented level of anonymity. While you may have to provide some information when buying Bitcoin with your credit card, every other transaction you make with Bitcoin, including depositing and withdrawing funds from an online casino, remains anonymous.\n\nLower Transaction Costs\n\nFiat currency transactions often pass through several institutions before they get to your online casino. And, since everyone wants a cut, this often results in higher transaction costs. On the other hand, cryptocurrency transactions work through the blockchain, facilitating transactions directly from your crypto wallet to your online casino.\n\nThis results in much lower transaction costs for you and the online casino. Online crypto casinos often pass on the savings to their clients through bonuses and other incentives.\n\nSecurity and Fraud Prevention\n\nCryptocurrency transactions, including Bitcoin transactions, are highly secure due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. As long as you keep your crypto wallet keys private, there\u2019s no way anyone can access your funds.\n\nOnline casinos also benefit from the reduced risk of chargebacks, fraud, and other payment-related issues, thus giving you and the online casino peace of mind.\n\nCons\n\nVolatility\n\nThe value of cryptocurrencies is subject to significant fluctuations. While the increased volatility may lead to increased profits in case of a market upturn, it could also work against you. For instance, if you buy Bitcoins at a higher value and then withdraw your winnings at a lower value, you may make a financial loss.\n\nSteep Learning Curve\n\nYou need to be at least moderately tech-savvy to use Bitcoin effectively. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, crypto is a bit more complex and may require some learning before you understand how it works.\n\nRegulatory Uncertainty\n\nThe regulatory uncertainty around crypto is alarming, to say the least. Different countries enact new regulations every other day, making it difficult to keep track of crypto progress. Actually, some countries have even banned it altogether. Failure to adhere to set regulations may leave both you and the online casino liable to legal action.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nDespite its popularity and widespread adoption in online gambling, Bitcoin has a few drawbacks. However, aside from the legal aspect, choosing to use Bitcoin for online gambling ultimately depends on your preferences, especially where your privacy and financial security are concerned.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "Breaking news from the BlackRock company, which, according to some rumors, appears to have purchased 12,200 Bitcoin, shaking up adoption within the crypto world in no small part.\n\nBreaking news: Bitcoin continues to capture the interest of institutional investors, BlackRock at the forefront\n\nAs anticipated, recent rumors are stirring the blockchain world, suggesting that BlackRock, one of the world\u2019s largest investment management firms, may have made a massive investment in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nIn fact, according to some sources, BlackRock has reportedly acquired a total of 12,200 Bitcoin, marking a significant step in institutional adoption of the leading cryptocurrency.\n\nAs is often the case, these rumors have sparked a frenzy of speculation within the cryptocurrency community and financial investors.\n\nIndeed, if the news turns out to be true, it would represent an unprecedented vote of confidence in Bitcoin\u2018s future from one of the world\u2019s most influential financial institutions.\n\nAs we know, BlackRock is no stranger to the world of cryptocurrencies, having explored and closely monitored the sector in recent years.\n\nHowever, an investment of this magnitude would mark a significant shift in the firm\u2019s investment strategy, with Bitcoin becoming a more prominent part of its global portfolio.\n\nThis development reflects institutional investors\u2019 growing interest in cryptocurrencies as a potentially lucrative asset class. Bitcoin, in particular, has attracted attention due to its growing adoption and deflationary nature.\n\nWhile BlackRock has not yet officially confirmed these rumors, the news has already catalyzed further discussion about regulation and Bitcoin\u2019s increasing integration into mainstream financial markets.\n\nWhether this monumental investment will mark the beginning of a new era for cryptocurrencies in the global financial world remains to be seen.\n\nMore rumors: the false claim about BlackRock\u2019s interest in XRP\n\nRecently, news has been circulating about BlackRock\u2019s alleged intention to shift its interest in the crypto world from Bitcoin to XRP.\n\nThis news originated from a dubious social media account and was spread without any verification.\n\nThe origin of this uproar seems to go back to a tweet from an account known to spread unverified news, WallStreetBulls, which speculated about an alleged \u201cshift in institutional trust to more sustainable and efficient digital assets.\u201d\n\nThis speculation was then amplified by an article on Investing.com, which claimed that BlackRock was reassessing its position on Bitcoin in favor of XRP, without citing any reliable sources.\n\nHowever, careful verification revealed that this rumor was baseless and the enthusiasm in the XRP community was unfounded.\n\nAlthough some members of the crypto community have urged caution, urging investors to demand hard evidence, there is no credible evidence to suggest an actual change of interest by BlackRock from Bitcoin to XRP.\n\nAs we know, BlackRock has shown increasing interest in the cryptocurrency market, including a call for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, all of these initiatives indicate a general interest in digital assets, rather than a specific focus on one cryptocurrency in particular.\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink also acknowledged the cryptocurrency sector\u2019s potential for financial revolution, marking a shift from his previous skepticism.\n\nIt remains to be seen how BlackRock\u2019s interest in cryptocurrency will develop in the coming months."

        "content": "With Bitcoin (BTC) starting the week on a bullish note, much like the majority of assets in the cryptocurrency market, experts predict more gains to come, and some are confident that the maiden digital asset will surpass $100,000 in the next couple of years.\n\nAs it happens, pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst PlanB, a.k.a. 100trillionUSD, reiterated the prognosis from earlier this year, arguing that Bitcoin\u2019s halving event could trigger its move above $32,000, with the 2025 bull market culminating at $100,000 and beyond, in an X post published on September 18.\n\nIndeed, as the expert pointed out, the November 2022 low was the bottom for Bitcoin, expecting it to rise towards the 2024 halving, particularly as it has already risen from $18,000 to $27,000 since January 12, when PlanB made the original prediction.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s realized price. Source: 100trillionUSD\n\nTherefore, the analyst believes that the 2024 halving will bring the largest crypto asset into a price range between $23,000 and $66,000, whereas the subsequent bull market in 2025 could trigger the run toward the range between $100,000 and as much as $1 million per unit.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time trading at the price of $27,320, indicating a gain of 2.84% on the day, while increasing its value by 6.43% across the previous week, and advancing 5.41% on its monthly chart, according to the information retrieved on September 18.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nNotably, Bitcoin has crossed a bullish cross for the first time in over a year, a bullish sign that has demonstrated itself in the recent recovery. Additionally, it still has 29 halving events remaining, each of them carrying the possibility of another rally.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) remains at the forefront of discussions as the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve due to its unique setup. Bitcoin\u2019s unique economic model, driven by its halving events, has intrigued the general financial world.\n\nSince the cryptocurrency\u2019s inception 14 years ago, the Bitcoin network has undergone only three halving events. Indeed, according to data provided by crypto content creator Shalva Machitidze, Bitcoin has a total of 32 halving events with 29 remaining, with attention focusing on how the asset will be impacted.\n\nBitcoin halving schedule. Source: Binance Feed\n\nIt is worth noting that halving is one of the key features that sets Bitcoin apart from traditional fiat currencies due to its predetermined issuance schedule. Notably, approximately every four years, or after every 210,000 blocks mined, miners\u2019 reward for confirming transactions and adding them to the blockchain is cut in half.\n\nIn the early days of Bitcoin, miners received 50 BTC per block, but after the first halving in 2012, this reward was reduced to 25 BTC. Subsequent halving events occurred in 2016 and 2020, reducing the reward to 12.5 BTC and then 6.25 BTC, respectively.\n\nBesides reducing miner rewards, the halving event also affects the number of coins in circulation. This impacts supply and demand, causing price fluctuations. Additionally, it curbs Bitcoin\u2019s inflation by reducing new coin creation, aligning with its deflationary design.\n\nWhat to expect from the remaining 29 Bitcoin halving events\n\nWith the remaining 29 halving events, Bitcoin\u2019s predetermined scarcity is often cited as one of the primary factors contributing to the asset\u2019s potential value appreciation. This scarcity, combined with growing demand, has historically driven up the price of Bitcoin.\n\nHistorical data indicates that Bitcoin\u2019s price has experienced significant rallies after previous halving events. Following the first halving in 2012, the price of Bitcoin surged from less than $12 to about $1,000 within a year. Similarly, after the 2016 halving, Bitcoin\u2019s price substantially increased to $20,000 by the end of 2017.\n\nThe most recent halving in May 2020 saw Bitcoin\u2019s price soar from approximately $8,000 to almost $69,000 in late 2021. These historical patterns have fueled optimism among investors and speculators as they eagerly await the next 29 halvings and their potential impact on the cryptocurrency\u2019s price, with 2024 as the next main focus.\n\nWill the next halving event trigger a price rally?\n\nIt is worth noting that past halving events didn\u2019t solely trigger bull markets. Larger macroeconomic factors likely played a significant role, particularly in the form of favorable fiat liquidity conditions led by institutional capital inflow into the asset. For instance, Bitcoin has been battered by high inflation and interest rate decisions over the past year.\n\nAfter the past three halving events, Bitcoin experienced substantial triple-digit price surges, reaching new all-time highs within 12 to 18 months before entering significant downtrends.\n\nInterestingly, these bear markets began to lose momentum approximately 15 to 16 months before the subsequent halving. For instance, Bitcoin has gained almost 55% in 2023, representing a rebound from the previous year\u2019s bear market. This trajectory aligns with the historical timing of previous price recoveries.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin remains steady above the $26,000 level, aiming for a potential rally toward $30,000. By press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $26,608, reflecting daily gains of approximately 0.31%.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart.
