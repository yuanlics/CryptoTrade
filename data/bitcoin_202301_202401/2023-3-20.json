        "title": "The Growing Use of Cryptocurrencies by Transnational Organized Crime Groups in Latin America - Georgetown Journal of International Affairs",
        "content": "Across Latin America, transnational criminal organizations, transnational gangs, and extra-regional actors supporting authoritarian regimes are exploiting growing cracks in the region\u2019s weak financial regulations by transferring parts of their financial holdings to cryptocurrency, thereby avoiding detection and asset seizures. Opportunities for criminal use of crypto have significantly increased in the past few years; a growing number of high corruption governments, which also act as money laundering havens, are actively courting unvetted crypto investors with purposeful deregulation and opacity.\n\nAcross Latin America, transnational criminal organizations that move billions of dollars a year in illicit profits are transferring parts of their financial holdings to cryptocurrencies as a way of avoiding detection and asset seizures. Many different groups, including the Mexico-based Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaci\u00f3n (CJNG) and Sinaloa Cartel, Central America-based MS-13 (Mara Salvatrucha), and Brazil-based PCC (Primeiro Comando da Capital), are discovering growing cracks in the regional anti-money laundering architecture that make the switch to cryptocurrencies increasingly attractive. The drop in value of most digital currencies may slow the trend in the short term, but as prices stabilize it will likely continue to grow in the mid to long term.\n\nWhile criminal use of cryptocurrencies is a global problem, Latin America, in particular, is a region where criminal groups take advantage of \u201cunregulated exchanges that do not require registration information and proof of identification for tracking purposes,\u201d per one specialized report. These groups often deposit Bitcoin into exchange accounts and trade it for various altcoins, obscuring the original source account.\n\nThere are multiple cases that demonstrate this trend, offering a useful but incomplete view of the magnitude of the changes underway. Blockchain systems are designed to make tracing transactions anonymous and even aggressive regulatory efforts around the world are in their infancy. As such, conceptualizing the expansion of blockchain systems in Latin America relies on compelling anecdotal evidence and analysis of the potential threats rather than quantitative data. For example, in December 2022, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) found that the CJNG used Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, to move $15 million to $40 million in illicit proceeds from the sale of cocaine and methamphetamines, combining new products and new laundering methods.\n\nThe December 2021 murder of a PCC leader in Brazil led to a Sao Paulo police investigation that found widespread use of cryptocurrency by the gang, including a $7.8 million transaction. In that same month, the US Treasury Department designated the PCC as a major criminal organization. In a separate Brazilian case, the so-called \u201cPharoah of Bitcoin\u201d ran a pyramid scheme, reportedly taking in $67 million from local and international investors, and is now enmeshed in allegations of murder, drug trafficking, and money laundering.\n\nOur fieldwork in the Northern Triangle of Central America (El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala) has found that the MS-13 transnational gang, designated by the US government as a major criminal organization since 2012, is increasingly demanding payment in Bitcoin for transporting cocaine to Mexico and in extortion cases. Given that almost all the gang\u2019s criminal activity is cash-based and growing rapidly, the ubiquity of Bitcoin ATMs and the ease of convertibility to dollars has made it more convenient and safer to use blockchain wallets than hoarding physical money in safe houses.\n\nIn addition to transnational criminal activities, state-run Bitcoin operations like Chivo Wallet in El Salvador have been widely used by transnational groups to scam users of millions of dollars. Finally, Russia and its allies in the hemisphere, such as the Maduro regime in Venezuela, have developed cryptocurrencies specifically designed to evade US and EU sanctions by bypassing the Western currency markets. A Russian national living in Uruguay designed and advised the development of the Venezuelan Petro crypto currency, a value transfer only useable between Venezuela and Russia through Russian banks. While not directly tied to transnational organized crime, the Maduro regime is widely recognized as financing itself through the sale of cocaine and illegally mined gold, meaning that much of the value transferred through the Petro system is likely derived from criminal activity.\n\nThe growth of cryptocurrency in transnational criminal organizations is difficult to quantify, but likely accelerating. This trend has been made possible by the growing number of high-corruption jurisdictions where deregulation is purposeful, and the currencies are welcomed for their opacity. The percentage of global cryptocurrency in Latin America has grown from about 6 percent in 2017 to 16 percent in 2020. Most of Latin America lacks robust banking regulations or Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, while efforts in the hemisphere to regulate cryptocurrencies are in their infancy, including in the United States. With the exception of Mexico and Venezuela, the vast majority of the countries across the region have only ad hoc regulations or notional discussions of regulations. The promotion of cryptocurrency by high-corruption countries provides growing access to and uses for these currencies in markets that are almost completely unregulated and unmonitored.\n\nEl Salvador has come under increasing scrutiny for its disregard for any regulation. More than a dozen senior members of President Nayib Bukele\u2019s administration and legislative allies have been sanctioned by the United States and had their visas revoked because of massive corruption. Additionally, the World Bank is withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in loans because of those concerns and government corruption.\n\nThe concerns began September 2021, when Bukele used his growing authoritarian power to make his country the world\u2019s first to declare Bitcoin legal tender on par with the US dollar, which is already El Salvador\u2019s legal currency. The law requires all major businesses accept Bitcoin and, while few people use the currency regularly, the cryptocurrency is both easy to use and easy to convert, which is at least a partial explanation for why the MS-13 and other gangs are pushing into its use. In addition to offering no regulation or monitoring of Bitcoin transactions, El Salvador also offers residency and citizenship based solely on Bitcoin purchases, creating a haven for those seeking safe harbor from prosecution for any crime. Further concerns about corruption emerged after Bukele tweeted about trading Bitcoin naked using funds from the national treasury, held in his private wallet, while losing an estimated $22 million with no accountability, transparency, or oversight.\n\nParaguay, a small, landlocked, and isolated nation in South America that is already a money laundering haven, is moving to follow El Salvador\u2019s blueprint for luring cryptocurrency business. While there are few public cases of the use of cryptocurrency by transnational criminal groups in Paraguay, financial crimes prosecutors and police investigators say that there are multiple cases. A number of factors make prosecuting such cases impossible.\n\nOne factor is that former president Horacio Cartes, who retains enormous economic and political influence, as well as the sitting vice president, who has a direct hand in cryptocurrency regulation, both have been designated \u201ccorrupt actors\u201d by the US government and had their US visas revoked. The designations, also applied to Cartes\u2019 US-based businesses, were compounded by public US allegations of both men\u2019s financial and political ties to the Lebanese-base Hezbollah, a designated terrorist group.\n\nThe interest of Cartes and his political acolytes still in power is a cause for concern because he is also the owner of the country\u2019s largest business conglomerate, which includes banks, hotels, media organizations, and cigarette factories. Cartes\u2019 economic power, access to the judiciary, and control of the media work together to keep many cases, including several tied to cryptocurrency money laundering, from coming to light.\n\nParaguay\u2019s competitive advantage is that it is the only country in the world that is solely reliant on renewable energy (hydroelectric power), meaning Bitcoin mining is relatively cheap and electricity is relatively plentiful. Since 2018, Paraguay has promoted itself as a Bitcoin hub. It is also one of the key corners of the Tri-Border region, along with Brazil and Argentina, where money laundering, cocaine trafficking, contraband, and other illicit activities by groups like the PCC dominate.\n\nWhile data is sparse, there is compelling case evidence and fieldwork research that shows transnational criminal organizations and transnational gangs are increasingly using cryptocurrencies to move and hide the profits from their illicit activities. A growing number of countries overwhelmed by endemic corruption, weak or non-existent regulatory infrastructure, and deliberately opaque crypto policies, help create an exceptionally fertile environment for this growth.\n\nGiven that how\u2014and even if\u2014to regulate cryptocurrency is an ongoing global debate, there is no quick policy prescription to keep transnational organized crime organizations from migrating to these systems to reduce the risk of asset tracing and seizure. However, US policymakers can take some steps to slow the trend.\n\nA first step is the development and implementation of basic KYC regulation and transparency in jurisdictions promoting the use of cryptocurrencies comparable to those in the formal banking structure. This form of regulation of the banking sector is a fundamental pillar of avoiding designation by the US State Department as a money laundering haven. These conditions should be met to avoid being named, shamed, and sanctioned by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in the form of being placed on its gray list and black list jurisdictions. This should be accompanied by US efforts to keep countries from granting citizenship based on cryptocurrency investments that likely incentivize fleeing justice in other jurisdictions. Such a policy could be achieved by refusing to recognize these types of citizenship documents. Finally, the United States can play a key role in helping regional institutions such as the Organization of America States (OAS) and regional development banks establish common crypto guidelines and regulations across the hemisphere.\n\n. . .\n\nDouglas Farah is the president and founder of IBI Consultants, a national security consulting firm focusing on transnational organized crime and extra-regional actors in Latin America, working with the US government, research foundations, and private clients.

        "content": "With Bitcoin staging a staggering rally in recent days amid turmoil within the global banking system, its advocates are now turning to the coin\u2019s next important milestone: $30,000.\n\nThe largest digital coin has gained roughly 25% since March 8, when signs first emerged of trouble around Silicon Valley Bank, which has since folded and ignited turmoil among other lenders. The digital currency has added more than 20% since the start of the month to trade around $28,000, its highest since June of last year when a series of implosions within the digital-assets space itself rocked the industry and pressured prices. It last traded at $30,000 during the meltdown of now bankrupt lender Celsius, also in June."

        "title": "Bitcoin briefly tops $28,000 for the first time in 9 months after bank crisis sparks weekend rally - CNBC",
        "content": "On Monday, the cryptocurrency had pulled back a bit. Bitcoin fell more than 2% to $27,705.23, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier in the day, it hit $28,554.07, it's highest level in nine months. Meanwhile, ether fell 3.5% to $1,765.60.\n\nThe weekend rally in bitcoin came amid continued turmoil in the global banking sector. On Sunday, UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) in a deal partly brokered by the Swiss regulators looking to stem contagion.\n\n\"Bitcoin continues to trade like a leading risk-on asset, like it has for the past two years,\" said James Lavish, managing partner at the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund. \"The rescue of Credit Suisse has put out a large credit fire ... this emboldens bitcoin buyers who are now anticipating the Fed slowing the increase in rates and signaling a coming pause this week.\"\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, there is about a 72% chance of a quarter-point increase by the Fed, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The other 28% anticipates there will be no hike and that Chairman Jerome Powell may start to ease his aggressive tightening campaign due to the emerging financial contagion.\n\nBitcoin is coming off its best week since January 2021, which was right before the first bull run that year, while ether just posted its best weekly gain since August 2021. The two are up for the year by 67% and 46%, respectively.\n\nFlight to safety\n\nAdvocates of bitcoin have often dubbed it \"digital gold\" referring to it as a store of value, particularly in moments of global turmoil, and one that is uncorrelated with other asset classes.\n\nNow, there are signals bitcoin's price movement is beginning to decouple from stocks, for now. The cryptocurrency's correlation with the S&P 500 is now at its lowest since September 2021, after reaching its highest in 2022, according to Coin Metrics.\n\n\"If one looks at the history of bitcoin and why it was created in the first place, it was precisely for events like this where the current system shows signs of weakness and hence owning an uncorrelated asset helps,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC. \"Over the years, this argument of bitcoin being an uncorrelated asset class has been debated quite a bit, but we are now potentially seeing that viewpoint being vindicated.\"\n\nBernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal argued in a Monday note that the market has been trading closer to its \"uncorrelated non-sovereign roots\" since the demise of FTX and the market structure \"feels a lot healthier, with no more distortions caused by FTX and Alameda.\"\n\nIn contrast to bitcoin and ether's year-to-date gains, returns on gold, the dollar, U.S. equities and bonds were \"less impaired last year, but have not bounced back as sharply\" either, and tech-dominated indices have performed only marginally better when high growth assets were beaten down during the rising rate cycle, they added."

        "content": "Magic Eden, one of the largest cross-chain NFT platforms, launched a Bitcoin marketplace for digital artifacts, the company shared on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are already a multichain platform and believe that adding Bitcoin will connect us to a deep community of people and a rapidly growing collectibles market thanks to Ordinals,\u201d Zhuoxun Yin, COO and co-founder of Magic Eden, said to TechCrunch. \u201cAdding a Bitcoin marketplace allows us to continue our multichain vision.\u201d\n\nOrdinals, an NFT-like project on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, has grown significantly since the first one was inscribed in December. By mid-February, over 90,000 Ordinals were inscribed \u2014 which is jargon for created (or minted) \u2014 on the Bitcoin blockchain. About a month later, there are more than 400,000 inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain, up 344% during that time frame, Magic Eden shared.\n\nPrior to the announcement, Magic Eden supported NFT trading on Solana and Polygon and provided aggregated listings for Ethereum-based NFTs. The platform is supported by major firms like Paradigm, Sequoia, Coinbase Ventures, Solana Ventures and others, and has more than 22 million unique monthly visitors and over 100,000 wallets connecting to its network daily, its website stated.\n\nMagic Eden launching a Bitcoin marketplace could be a significant step forward because there are limited tools and products for the blockchain\u2019s trading market, which has made the space inaccessible and unsafe for nonprofessional users. Going forward, this could expand its reach to a bigger audience.\n\nThe launch will also integrate two noncustodial crypto wallets, Hiro and Xverse, so users can process transactions.\n\n\u201cThe Bitcoin NFT ecosystem is very new and a lot of the tooling that exists today is not optimal and lacks robust security measures,\u201d Yin said. \u201cWe want to come in with a serious focus on security and transparency while leveraging our brand so that people can feel safe when trading their Ordinals, thus opening up the ecosystem to flourish even more.\u201d\n\nAs the overall NFT market continues to grow, the subsector is still discovering its product-market fit, Yin thinks. \u201cThe growth of Bitcoin NFTs indicates that there\u2019s a market for people who want to own true digital artifacts or collectibles.\u201d\n\nMagic Eden has \u201calways taken a long-term view\u201d that NFTs will be the center of culture over many years, Yin said.\n\nWhile NFTs have gained popularity within the crypto industry, the mainstream world is still slow to adopt it, even though major brands and companies like Starbucks, Adidas and Nike have launched initiatives in the past year to implement NFT-like products and services.\n\nFor Magic Eden\u2019s initial beta launch of its Bitcoin Marketplace, it selected 13 collections to partner with, including Taproot Wizards, Inscribed Pepes and Bitcoin Bandits, to name a few. Those collections were selected because they were some of the earliest to be inscribed and have the \u201cstrongest communities,\u201d Yin said. \u201cWe see value in partnering with early adopters as many of them have been pioneers for Ordinal theory as well as contributors to Bitcoin\u2019s culture for many years.\u201d\n\nIn the near future, all Bitcoin inscriptions will be available for trading on Magic Eden, Yin noted. In the long term, Magic Eden plans to continue building out new use cases on new chains.\n\n\u201cDespite where the market is at, we are continuing to build in the bear and we\u2019re showing people that we are doubling down on our commitment to the long-term potential for NFTs,\u201d Yin added."

        "title": "Bitcoin Halving a Year Out: Here's What To Expect - Blockworks",
        "content": "As the next Bitcoin halving approaches, industry experts are closely examining the implications for price and hash rate over a long-term horizon.\n\nThe halving event, set to occur around mid-April 2024, is expected to have a significant impact on the crypto market, according to a report published Monday by research firm BitOoda.\n\nThe report suggests the key driver of bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price is the flow of funds into the ecosystem \u2014 currently amounting to about $25 million per day \u2014 to absorb the roughly 900 new BTC entering circulation through mining; blocks are mined, on average, every 10 minutes, minting 6.25 bitcoins each.\n\nAt the halving, the supply of new bitcoins received by miners \u2014 also known as the coinbase reward \u2014 is reduced by half. This happens all at once, from one bitcoin block to the next.\n\nThe report also notes sentiment can play a role in price discovery \u2014 where the investors see the bitcoin market going.\n\nLooking at historical data, BitOoda said the six months following each of the prior halvings have seen an increase in price, with the most significant increase occurring after the first halving in 2012 when the price surged more than ten times its value.\n\nIn 2016, bitcoin\u2019s price increased by 53% six months post-halving while the 2020 halving was preceded by a mostly flat price \u2014 excluding the exogenous shock of the March COVID-driven sell-off, 60 days prior to the event, BitOoda said. Bitcoin\u2019s price then gained more than 70% over the following 180 days.\n\nWhile the dollar value of mined BTC initially fell after each halving, the post-halving fund flows have always caused the price to recover throughout Bitcoin\u2019s history, data by CryptoQuant shows.\n\nThe effect has become more muted over time, CryptoQuant told Blockworks, with the impact of each halving\u2019s reduction in supply, diminishing relative to other factors.\n\n\u201cAdoption, institutional demand, easier access to bitcoin and macro factors become more important for bitcoin\u2019s price growth,\u201d Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant\u2019s head of research, said.\n\nPrice of bitcoin compared against the flows of capital to derivative exchanges | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nMoreno pointed out that when capital flows are growing \u2014 meaning demand to trade bitcoin is increasing \u2014 the asset appreciates and vice versa.\n\nThe Bitcoin price correlation to hash rate\n\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem is likely to continue experiencing significant growth in the coming years, with both price and hash rate expected to increase steadily leading up to the next halving event in 2024, the report notes.\n\nPrice moves tend to lead hash rate, with sustained hash rate growth typically driven by price appreciation, the firm said, although this is debated.\n\nThe Bitcoin network\u2019s hash rate is a measure of the computing power dedicated to the network by miners worldwide. It represents the total number of hashes that can be performed by all miners in a given period and is measured in exahashes per second (EH/s).\n\nBased on data from YCharts, the current bitcoin network hash rate is 320.42 EH/s \u2014 up about 51% from a year ago but down 8.6% on the day.\n\nThe increase in hash rate over the past year is likely due to the increasing number of miners joining the network, as well as the adoption of more powerful mining equipment.\n\nThis has resulted in greater competition for mining rewards and an increase in the network\u2019s overall security.\n\nThe increasing number of bitcoin miners is a reflection of the improving market sentiment, as seen in the upward movement of spot prices for digital assets. This comes at a time when industry participants are re-evaluating a risk-on approach to protect wealth.\n\nAn analysis of hash rate scenarios shows a link to the estimated power price curve, suggesting the convergence of ASIC technology to leading-edge semiconductor processes will bring next-gen hardware to the market in late 2023, with volume shipments expected in 2024.\n\n\u201cAs more powerful and efficient ASICs have been developed, hashrate has experienced an acceleration as miners enjoy a lower capital and operational cost per terahash deployed,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cThe latest generation of ASICs are about 50% to 100% more powerful than the previous models.\u201d\n\nBitOoda estimates the theoretical \u201cmarginal maximum hashrates\u201d could achieve 432 EH/s by the end of 2023 and 721 EH/s by the end of 2024, assuming power prices remain below $50 per megawatt hour.\n\nThough the reality is likely to be closer to 400 EH/s by the end of 2023, reflecting a significant amount of older equipment still in use, the research firm said.\n\nLonger term, the security of the Bitcoin network will depend more on transaction fees. Miners\u2019 production costs will become less a function of their expectations of coinbase rewards, as Satoshi observed.\n\n\u201cIn later years, when new coin generation is a small percentage of the existing supply, market price will dictate the cost of production more than the other way around,\u201d Satoshi wrote in 2010.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "title": "Cryptocurrencies To Watch: Week of March 20 - Investopedia",
        "content": "Keep an Eye on These Coins\n\nThe cryptocurrency market experienced a sudden surge in value over the last week, after an extended rough period. The current turmoil in the bank sector appears to have given a boost to the crypto market, especially Bitcoin, as some investors opt for digital assets for diversification.\n\nThis week, we examine Bitcoin (BTC), Conflux (CFX), Mask Network (MASK), Fantom (FTM), and Neo (NEO). In selecting these assets, we have considered several factors, including positive technical developments, significant news events, and noticeable price changes.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price advanced around 25% in the wake of several unsettling incidents in the global economy and banking sector.\n\nConflux (CFX)'s price jumped 125%, possibly in reaction to integrations with major companies in China.\n\nMask Network (MASK)'s price rose more than 80%, as large, influential investors began accumulating the token and crypto exchange Binance added it to its proof-of-reserves system.\n\nThe price of Fantom (FTM) gained more than 24% amid a mainnet upgrade.\n\nThe price of the NEO (NEO) token went up by more than 20%, potentially due to its growing China presence, as well as the fact that crypto trading is being embraced by Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin (BTC) jumped in the latest week, increasing by about 25%. The cryptocurrency has finally broken through its recent resistance levels, meaning the price zone that the digital asset has had trouble breaking above in technical analysis.\n\nThe driver for this sudden rise might be turbulent global economic conditions. Historically, investors flocked to Bitcoin when there have been troubling events in traditional markets. The failure of several banks, inflation rates, and dollar-liquidity decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve all may have contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s price surge.\n\nBTC is hovering at around $28,067 after trading around $22,450 last week (see chart below).\n\nBTC price: TradingView\n\nConflux (CFX)\n\nConflux (CFX) was the biggest gainer this week, with the CFX token more than doubling in price and crossing the $1 billion market-capitalization figure. There are several possible factors feeding the price increase, with one being the project's integration with China\u2019s version of Instagram, Xiaohongshu. The project also announced the launch of SIM cards using Conflux Network's blockchain support in collaboration with China Telecom.\n\nConflux is a blockchain network that offers fast transaction processing for anything from nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to cryptocurrency wallets. CFX started last week at about 19 cents and is now priced at around 43 cents (see chart below).\n\n\n\nCFX price: TradingView\n\nMask Network (MASK)\n\nThe Mask Network\u2019s MASK token (MASK) was another major gainer in the latest week, increasing by more than 80%. The jump may be tied to trades by large buyers\u2014known as whales in crypto terminology\u2014and the fact that crypto exchange Binance added the asset to its proof-of-reserves system along with 10 other tokens.\n\nThe crypto whales' buying of large sums of MASK has in turn attracted a greater number of smaller buyers. Proof of reserves is a transparent auditing practice for crypto companies like Binance that provides an unbiased report of the companies\u2019 assets in reserve. MASK is now hovering at around $5.80 after being priced at about $3.20 last week (see chart below).\n\nMASK price: TradingView\n\nFantom (FTM)\n\nThe Fantom (FTM) coin increased by more than 24%, likely due to a mainnet upgrade and possibly in line with the fact that the project offers some of the lowest transaction fees on the market. Mainnet is used to describe the point at which a blockchain protocol is fully developed and deployed, with crypto transactions being broadcast, verified, and recorded on a distributed ledger. Fantom's upgrade allows its network to process certain files and logs more quickly.\n\nFantom's latest upgrade also speeds up block processing times by 30%. That metric determines how quickly each block of transactions is finalized. FTM is now valued at around 48 cents after trading last week at 39 cents (see chart below).\n\n\n\nFTM price: TradingView\n\nNeo (NEO)\n\nNEO (NEO)'s coin increased in price by about 20%, possibly because crypto coins with a presence in China are experiencing a resurgence, according to one crypto analyst on Twitter. The fact that Hong Kong, since late 2022, has taken a more friendly stance toward crypto trading may be another reason for the token\u2019s gain.\n\nNEO is a general-purpose crypto network and ecosystem that offers features such as decentralized storage, smart-contract functionality, and decentralized applications, known as dApps. NEO is now valued at around $12.65 but was trading at about $10.70 last week (see chart below).\n\n\n\nNEO price: TradingView\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "title": "Bitcoin Bros Can't Stop Gloating About the Bank Crisis - The Daily Beast",
        "content": "Three banks have crashed and another is on life support, the U.S. banking system is on rocky ground, and fears of a recession are skyrocketing. But one group is thrilled about the current situation: the Bitcoin bros.\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank this month, along with the smaller Signature and Silvergate banks, was followed by a rally in the price of Bitcoin after a painful year that wiped $2 trillion of value out of the crypto market. Largely silent since the fall of industry darling FTX, the crypto enthusiasts re-emerged on Twitter in recent weeks to boast about their investment\u2014even as others worried about their ability to pay the bills.\n\nThe chest-thumping started on March 10, when a massive run on the bank caused SVB to collapse. The bank was a lifeline for many in the tech industry, including small startup founders, who started to panic about not being able to pay their employees or put dinner on the table. Major national economists warned about a contagion that could level still more banks and drag down an already struggling economy.\n\nSome Bitcoin enthusiasts, however, chose that moment to take a victory lap.\n\n\u201cBanks failing. I wonder where I can put my money where I don\u2019t need to trust anyone? Like maybe Bitcoin?\u201d crypto entrepreneur and advocate Dan Held tweeted that day, adding a smirking emoji.\n\n\u201cRT if you trust #Bitcoin more than banks,\u201d Bitcoin Magazine, the host of the annual Bitcoin Conference, tweeted that weekend.\n\nA few days later, the federal government announced it would ensure deposits in the bank, making all SVB customers whole. The move saved thousands from financial ruin but sparked debate over whether yet another bank bailout\u2014even one not funded by U.S. taxpayers\u2014was the right call.\n\nThe Bitcoin bros just saw it as an opportunity to post.\n\n\u201c#Bitcoin will never need a #Bailout,\u201d tweeted Michael Saylor. He later retweeted a video clip of crypto podcaster Natalie Brunell\u2019s Fox News appearance, where she declared that \u201cBitcoin worked this weekend when banks didn't,\u201d and that the U.S. dollar is \u201cdying by a thousand cuts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is our time!! Let\u2019s go team $BTC!! Let\u2019s go $ETH!!\u201d tweeted Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz. \u201cThe decentralized revolution is happening.\u201d (Novogratz famously got a tattoo of a different cryptocurrency, Luna, weeks before its value crashed to zero.)\n\nThe cheering only grew louder as the price of Bitcoin continued to rise last week. Tyler Winklevoss, the tech entrepreneur whose crypto company, Gemini, is facing charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission, predicted Friday that the price of Bitcoin could reach $30,000 by the end of the weekend.\n\nFormer Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan took it even farther, betting a follower on Saturday that Bitcoin would reach $1 million within 90 days. \u201cYou buy 1 BTC. I will send $1M USD,\u201d he tweeted. The pseudonymous follower took the bet; he told The Daily Beast via Twitter DM the two sides were just \u201cironing out the details with a lawyer.\u201d\n\nJoshua White, a finance professor at Vanderbilt University, called these bold predictions nothing more than \u201chype\u201d meant to drive up the value of Bitcoin. He noted that buying Bitcoin from a crypto exchange like Coinbase or Binance was not inherently safer than investing with banks, because those exchanges could also go bankrupt and lose customers\u2019 money. Users could store their tokens in their own crypto wallets, he added, but that requires a fair amount of technical savvy.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine the mom and pop running a wine store in Nashville that says, \u2018I don't trust this bank, let me go put this money in Bitcoin,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nOf the crypto fans predicting a Bitcoin boom, he added: \u201cThey also argued that Bitcoin was an inflation hedge, and we did not see that.\u201d\n\nBitcoin did not cross $30,000 by the end of last weekend, nor did it come anywhere near its historic high of more than $65,000 in 2021. According to crypto investment group CoinShares, people took more money out of digital currencies last week than they put in\u2014for the sixth week in a row. Net outflows were more than $95 million last week alone, with Bitcoin seeing the most sell-offs.\n\nPlus, some industry experts believe the bank failures could actually wind up hurting crypto: Silvergate and Signature were two of the only banks in the U.S. willing to work with crypto companies.\n\n\u201cThe impacts would be really big if there is no U.S. bank that will take on deposits from a crypto client,\u201d Taylor Johnson, a co-founder of crypto product company PsyFi, told Time. \u201cIt would be very painful, and reduce crypto activity a ton for any U.S. person or business.\u201d\n\nWhether Srinivasan gets his $1 million back remains to be seen."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price is approaching the average buy-in the largest public holder of bitcoin paid for its massive BTC stash.\n\nBusiness intelligence firm MicroStrategy held 132,500 bitcoins, as of Dec. 31. The original cost basis for the BTC pile was nearly $4 billion, reflecting an average cost per bitcoin of about $30,137.\n\nThe price of bitcoin was about $28,200 at 3 pm ET Monday, up roughly 26% from a week ago.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s net loss was $250 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, the company reported in February. Its digital asset impairment charges \u2014 which comes into play if the market value of bitcoin decreases below its market-adjusted purchase value \u2014 were $198 million during the quarter.\n\nExecutives said on an earnings call last month that the firm planned to continue its longtime strategy of buying and holding bitcoin on its balance sheet.\n\nDan Weiskopf \u2014 a co-portfolio manager of the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) \u2014 told Blockworks that bitcoin\u2019s price is more relevant to traders than to MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor.\n\nSaylor has made it clear his company will be a strategic longterm bitcoin owner.\n\n\u201cSome investors may mark the moment when MicroStrategy\u2019s 132,500 BTC is at a breakeven level; I don\u2019t think Saylor ever thought that was not a high probability,\u201d Weiskopf told Blockworks. \u201cIn fact, I am confident for him it is a short-term mark and only the beginning for what he expects bitcoin will accomplish.\u201d\n\nA MicroStrategy spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nAnalysts have been critical of the company in the past about its buying and holding strategy amid market volatility.\n\nEdward Moya, a senior market analyst for foreign exchange company OANDA, said last June that MicroStrategy \u201chas failed to capitalize on the way up and find protection when things got ugly,\u201d adding that the company has been \u201creckless with their portfolio management.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s unrealized losses when bitcoin dropped to below $16,000 in November, MicroStrategy\u2019s totaled nearly $2 billion.\n\nNew bull indicator\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rally of late has closed that unrealized gap.\n\n\u201cMicrostrategy has survived a crypto ice age and now has an opportunity to take advantage of growing interest in DeFi and all the other crypto protocols with better growth potential,\u201d Moya told Blockworks Monday. \u201cWith no true bitcoin ETF coming, Microstrategy is still positioned to attract new investors.\u201d\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s stock price was $261.50 at 3 pm ET Monday \u2014 up about 80% year to date, but down roughly 2% on the day.\n\nWeiskopf said the latest bitcoin price gains have been caused in part by the broadening of BTC use cases \u2014 such as bitcoin ordinals \u2014 that could spur MicroStrategy to buy even more of the asset.\n\nMarcus Sotiriou, a market analyst at GlobalBlock, said in a research note that bitcoin reaching $28,000 over the weekend signals the start of a new bull trend.\n\n\u201cThe recent closures of US banking giants have acted as a catalyst for bitcoin\u2019s price increase,\u201d Sotiriou wrote. \u201cThe drawbacks of the banking system are a key proponent for decentralized assets such as bitcoin.\u201d\n\nMorningstar senior research analyst Madeline Hume said MicroStrategy has vowed to add to its bitcoin position while cash flows are in excess of working capital\u2014 and while equity raises are feasible.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s working capital is negative, Hume said, suggesting additional purchases are unlikely in the short term.\n\n\u201cAcross the capital markets, liquidity raises have ground to a halt given the jittery macro environment,\u201d she told Blockworks. \u201cAny additional tactical moves, including a liquidation of some portion of the bitcoin holdings, would depend on the firm\u2019s ability to finance its activities in other ways, including the firm\u2019s ability to borrow.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

Polkadot led the losers, while Solana rose. U.S. equities rebounded on Monday as financial authorities added liquidity to markets and announced other measures to ease concern about weakness in the global banking system. Investor focus now shifts back to inflation as the Federal Reserve announces its interest rate decision on Wednesday.\n\nSee related article: Over 80 Web3 firms in line to set up shop in HK, ahead of crypto regulations taking effect in June\n\nFast facts\n\nBitcoin edged up 0.04% in the past 24 hours to US$27,920 at 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, moving up 15.00% for the last seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency hit a nine-month high of US$28,527 on Monday.\n\nEther dropped 1.32% to US$1,753, holding a weekly gain of 4.72%. The token hasn\u2019t kept up with the gains in Bitcoin as the Shanghai hard fork that will allow withdrawals of staked ether is now expected on April 12, or in about three weeks, and the analysis is mixed on whether this could generate fresh selling of the token by investors looking to lock in profits.\n\nPolkadot led the losers with a 4.18% drop and traded at US$6.16 to remain flat for the seven days.\n\nApart from Bitcoin, Solana was the only top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrency that rose in the 24 hour period. The token added 3.13% to US$22.57 for a weekly gain of 10.80%. Solana Foundation concluded Grizzlython over the weekend, the largest decentralized app (dapp) competition held by Solana. More than 800 projects were submitted and the winners will be announced in early April.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 0.73% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours rose 16.78% to US$76.81 billion.\n\nThe U.S. equities rebounded on Monday as fears of more bank failures eased. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.20%, the S&P 500 added 0.89%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index edged 0.39% higher.\n\nInvestors welcomed moves by authorities over the weekend to orchestrate the takeovers of Signature Bank and Credit Suisse. The share price of New York Community Bancorp, which will acquire Signature Bank, jumped 31.65%. Shares in UBS Group AG, rose 3.30% after it bought Credit Suisse, according to data from Yahoo Finance.\n\nDespite the overall stabilization, the share price of the embattled First Republic Bank slumped 47.11% on Monday, after S&P Global downgraded the bank\u2019s credit rating on Sunday for a second time in five days, and said the recent US$30 billion injection from other major U.S. banks may not be enough to resolve Republic Bank\u2019s \u201csubstantial business, liquidity, funding, and profitability challenges.\u201d\n\nSome commentators have said the banking problems can be partly attributed to the eight interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve since March 2022 to contain inflation. U.S. interest rates are between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007.\n\nThe Fed will announce its next decision on rates on Wednesday and analysts at the CME Group expect a 73.8% chance the Fed will raise by 25 basis points. The likelihood the Fed will leave rates unchanged amid the bank solvency concerns is at 26.2%, an increase from 23.2% on Monday.\n\nAhead of the opening of U.S. equity markets on Tuesday, U.S. stock futures edged up as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures and the S&P 500 futures both gained 0.18%. The Nasdaq Composite Index moved 012% higher.\n\nSee related article: Singapore to publish crypto, stablecoin consultation feedback by mid-2023"

Meanwhile, gold \u2014 often considered a hedge against inflation and market uncertainty \u2014 is up around 9% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s recent outperformance can be attributed to a number of factors, including the narrative of store-of-value, which has returned to prominence despite its past inability to perform that role in practice.\n\nGrumelart pointed to bitcoin\u2019s storied origins in the 2008 financial crisis, as a tool to combat negligence within the existing financial system, and said the current economic climate marked \u201ca perfect storm\u201d for bitcoin to prove its worth.\n\nThat climate is the culmination of a series of spectacular bank failures in the US and abroad which threatened to boil over this month, prompting regulators to step in and provide a backstop for depositors.\n\nAfter the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the FDIC shut down of Signature Bank, First Republic Bank was also propped up by a private sector rescue and banks drew on nearly $12 billion of loans from the US Federal Reserve\u2019s new emergency lending program.\n\nAnd on Sundsy, Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse was saved from collapse by a takeover from rival UBS in a $3.25 billion deal.\n\nShort-term liquidity boost is bitcoin\u2019s gain\n\nIn total, nearly $300 billion has been supplied via expansion of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet, including of a record $153 billion drawn from the Fed\u2019s discount window.\n\nAll eyes are now locked on the outcome of the next FOMC meeting on Wednesday where the Fed will decide either to scale back its campaign of increased rate hikes, designed to combat inflation, or continue business as usual which has contributed to the breaking of the US retail banking sector.\n\n\u201cA number of central banks are stuck between a rock and a hard place, they simply cannot afford to let the banking sector collapse,\u201d Grumelart said. \u201cWhile the liquidity spike is positive for all assets, the implications of the action just taken are still unknown.\u201d\n\nThe correlation between bitcoin and equities has been largely influenced by the perception the crypto industry, until the recent crisis, served as a risk-on indicator that was closely connected to the economic performance and monetary policies of the US and global markets.\n\nWhile financial companies have been struggling, the tech sector has been resilient, with the Nasdaq Composite up over 4% and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund up about 17% for the year.\n\nTesla and Nvidia, up 67% and 79% YTD respectively, have their own unique drivers that have propelled their prices in recent months, Grumelart said. High-beta risk assets are primarily affected by market liquidity and risk appetite, leading to periods of correlation.\n\nAlthough many risk assets have seen short-term gains, should economic conditions continue to deteriorate, high-growth equities are expected to suffer. But Grumelart is looking for bitcoin to decouple from Big Tech and follow commodities instead.\n\n\u201cIf inflation reaches a double peak, it is likely that most high-performing assets, with the exception of commodities and bitcoin, will reverse most of their gains for the year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world should be glad that we have bitcoin as an option to protect our wealth in moments like this.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss the next big story \u2013 join our free daily newsletter."

        "content": "One of the leading American banks \u2013 Goldman Sachs \u2013 highlighted bitcoin as the best-performing asset since the start of the new year.\n\nThe primary cryptocurrency surpasses Nasdaq 100, gold, S&P 500, and other investment assets and sectors.\n\nThe bank said bitcoin\u2019s potential had outpaced that of traditional assets, precious metals, and other investments in terms of year-to-date (YTD) and risk-adjusted returns.\n\nContrary to 2022, the primary digital asset has started off the new year on the right foot. Its price has skyrocketed from $16,500 on January 1 to approximately $28,400 at the moment of writing these lines (a 70% increase).\n\nThe rally caused some to believe that the bear market could be over and that BTC has entered into a new bull run. One example is Eric Peters \u2013 CEO of One River Digital Asset Management \u2013 who recently claimed that the next phase will be \u201cvery powerful\u201d because major institutions will dive in.\n\nRyan Selkis \u2013 CEO of the crypto intelligence firm Messari \u2013 also outlined a favorable scenario for bitcoin, forecasting its valuation to surge to $100,000 in the next twelve months.\n\nHe thinks it will act as \u201ca life raft and peaceful exit option\u201d to the adverse events in the financial world, including additional bank collapses, that could occur in the near future.\n\nThe most bullish prediction came from Coinbase\u2019s former CTO \u2013 Balaji Srinivasan \u2013 who wagered $2 million against Twitter user James Medlock that bitcoin will be worth $1 million in 90 days. He believes the price expansion will happen due to a possible collapse of the US banking system and consecutive hyperinflation.\n\n\u201cI am moving $2M into USDC for the bet. I will do it with Medlock and one other person, sufficient to prove the point. See my next tweet. Everyone else should just go buy Bitcoin, as it\u2019ll be much cheaper for you than locking one up for 90 days,\u201d Srinivasan said."

If he wins, then he keeps the bitcoin and the stablecoin.\n\n\u201cYou buy 1 BTC. I will send $1M USD,\u201d the former Coinbase exec tweeted. \u201cThis is ~40:1 odds as 1 BTC is worth ~$26k. The term is 90 days.\u201d\n\nMr Srinivasan said he believed that the meteoric price rise would come as a result of hyperinflation of the US dollar.\n\n\u201cThe central bank, the banks, and the bank regulators have bankrupted all of us,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey hid their insolvency from you, the depositors. And they\u2019re about to print $2T to hyperinflate the dollar. In the digital age this will happen very quickly. So buy bitcoin *now* and get your coins off exchanges. \u201c\n\nPrevious bets have been made by high-profile figures about bitcoin hitting the $1 million mark, with the late cyber security pioneer John McAfee saying in 2017 that he thought it would happen by 2020.\n\n\u201cIf not, I will eat my d**k on national television,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nIn July 2020, when bitcoin was around $10,000, he said: \u201cI never believed bitcoin would hit $1 mil. It\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s an old, tired, worthless coin. I just wanted to eat my d**k on TV. Wait for it.\u201d\n\nHe was arrested later that year and died in a Spanish prison cell in June 2021 before he had a chance to fulfil the bet."

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s price broke above the February 2023 highs of $25,200 after U.S. inflation data was in consensus with the market expectation. The potential fallout of the global banking system further promoted Bitcoin investment as a non-correlated global hedging instrument similar to gold in March. The correlation between gold and Bitcoin (BTC) has been rising since the start of the month.\n\nCorrelation coefficient between BTC and gold. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, institutions have become net sellers of Bitcoin in 2023, which raises some red flags. Bitcoin whales \u2014 wallets holding between 10 BTC and 10,000 BTC \u2014 have not participated in the current rally. It appears that retail investors are mainly driving the uptrend. The divergence between whale and retail investment could cause a short-term pullback in Bitcoin prices.\n\nInstitutions are forced BTC sellers, says analyst\n\nInstitutional crypto asset flows data from CoinShares reveals the largest two-week sell-off from investment funds since March 6. The outflows have erased the positive inflows for this year, with the net year-to-date flow equalling negative $177 million.\n\nCoinShares\u2019 data tracks the portfolio of global institutional funds with digital asset exposure, including Grayscale, CoinShares XBT, 21Shares, Purpose and 3iQ.\n\nJames Butterfill, CoinShares\u2019 head of research, notes in the report that the flows \u201cmay be driven, in part, by the need for liquidity during this banking crisis, a similar situation was seen when the COVID panic first hit the market in March 2020.\u201d\n\nInstitutional flow of crypto assets. Source: CoinShares\n\nButterfill\u2019s theory about forced sell-offs by institutions may have some credibility, as on-chain analytics firm Santiment informed Cointelegraph that it \u201cdo[es] not currently see major whale sell-offs at this time. Bitcoin addresses holding 10-10,000 BTC have remained essentially flat.\u201d\n\nIt is encouraging that whales are not looking to sell the current rally. However, as the prices continue to rise, the asset will require whale buyers to join the bandwagon \u2014 otherwise, the rally could fade soon.\n\nAdditionally, the recent depegging of USD Coin (USDC) and the regulatory crackdown on Binance USD (BUSD) have likely caused a minor whale exodus from stablecoins. Santiment reported that \u201caddresses holding between $100,000 to $10 million in stablecoins have been dropping slightly, but not to a notably high degree.\u201d\n\nA flow of stablecoins to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is positive for prices. However, large-scale conversions from stablecoins to dollars weaken the market\u2019s buying power. The lack of growth in whale BTC holdings suggests that the flows represent more of the latter situation.\n\nWhale holdings of BTC and stablecoins. Source: Santiment\n\nAnother crucial stakeholder in the Bitcoin economy is BTC miners. The BTC holdings in one-hop miner addresses \u2014 BTC accounts that receive coins from mining pools \u2014 have increased steadily since the start of 2023.\n\nSome miners booked some profit on March 14 when Bitcoin\u2019s price broke above $25,000 for the first time and again a week later when it touched $28,000. However, the total holdings are still in an uptrend since the start of 2023.\n\nHoldings on one-hop miner addresses. Source: Coin Metrics\n\nRetail investors on spot exchanges are driving prices\n\nSo far, spot purchases by retail investors are likely driving the rally. Will Clemente, an independent on-chain analyst and the co-founder of Reflexivity Research, tweeted that the uptrend \u201cappears to be mostly spot driven\u201d with muted open interest volumes for BTC futures contracts and funding rates on perpetual contracts.\n\nThe holdings of Bitcoin addresses with less than 10 BTC continue to surge to new all-time highs. The distribution among small hands adds credibility to the \u201carguments against Bitcoin regarding supply concentration\u201d among a few large holders.\n\nRelated: Holding Bitcoin: A profitable affair 88.5% of days\n\nHowever, retail investors have a poor track record in timing market entries and exits. Thus, the participation of whale investors is crucial for confidence in the present rally.\n\nTechnically, the BTC/USD pair appears strong on a daily time frame, with a positive breakout and consolidation above its broadening wedge pattern. Currently, buyers are facing resistance from the June 2022 breakdown levels between $28,000 and $30,000.\n\nBTC/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView\n\nOn the other hand, the CME futures data raises the chance of a pullback with two unfilled gaps toward $26,500 and $19,500. A price gap on CME futures charts is formed during U.S. holidays and weekends when the spot trading of Bitcoin on exchanges creates a difference between the closing and opening price on CME.\n\nUsually, CME gaps are filled by a price action toward the closing price on CME to retrace the pump on the futures market. Veteran trader Peter Brandt advised opening a short BTC position based on the gap.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance that more sophisticated investors are waiting for the U.S. Federal Reserve policy rate meeting on March 22 before opening their swing positions. The Fed\u2019s policy rate announcement will likely act as a strong market mover, inducing significant volatility in the market.\n\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors\u2019 alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Just How Realistic Is a Bitcoin Price Target of $100,000? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "There has been a lot of Bitcoin (BTC 1.59%) exuberance lately, with Bitcoin up more than 15% over the past week, and almost 70% for the year. Bitcoin now trades at almost $28,000, and accounts for a staggering 46% of the total market capitalization of the $1.2 trillion crypto market. Everyone, it seems, wants a piece of Bitcoin these days.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, given all this bullishness, some tech insiders are now predicting that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 soon, perhaps within the next 12 months. That includes Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who recently suggested a price of $100,000 was possible. But just how realistic is this price target? After all, Bitcoin's all-time-high is $68,789.63, and that was at the peak of the bull market in tech. Here's a closer look at several factors to keep in mind if you're expecting Bitcoin to soar by the end of the year.\n\nInterest rates\n\nUntil recently, the primary factor influencing the future price of Bitcoin was the Federal Reserve and the path of U.S. interest rates. Thus, for Bitcoin to continue its extraordinary ascent, it seems that it's going to need some help from the Fed. If the Fed pauses its interest rate hikes, or even decides to lower interest rates, that would be very bullish for Bitcoin.\n\nGiven the current state of the banking sector, which has been pummeled by rising rates, this might actually happen. That's probably why forecasts of Bitcoin at $100,000 are starting to pop up. Lower interest rates are typically favorable for risk assets such as crypto. But lower interest rates aren't a guarantee.\n\nBitcoin as digital gold (the sequel)\n\nRemember when everyone thought Bitcoin was \"digital gold\" and a safe haven against inflation? That was the general thinking among crypto investors until the 2022 market meltdown. Well, it looks like that argument is coming back, in a slightly different form. It's hard to ignore the growing number of analysts who are calling Bitcoin a potential safe haven in the face of a gathering financial storm. Some people are actually saying they'd rather hold Bitcoin than put their money into risky banks.\n\nSo if Bitcoin does replace gold as the safe haven asset of choice, then that would be bullish for Bitcoin. Keep your eye, too, on what the big institutional investors are doing with their portfolio allocations. If more and more of them increase their exposure to Bitcoin, then that would also be a huge plus. Some are even suggesting that corporations might start to hold Bitcoin directly on their balance sheets.\n\nTech stocks\n\nUntil the recent banking turmoil, the crypto asset class was highly correlated with the performance of tech stocks. In other words, if big Silicon Valley stocks went up, then crypto went up. If big Silicon Valley stocks went down, then crypto went down.\n\nSo I think this is where the $100,000 target idea starts to break down. Have you checked the news recently from the likes of Meta Platforms, which just laid off another 10,000 employees? Or Amazon, which yesterday said it was cutting an additional 9,000 jobs. A number of big-name tech companies have also announced huge rounds of layoffs, so I don't see a rebound happening in tech stocks anytime soon. Add in the fact that Silicon Valley Bank was the go-to lender for small tech start-ups, and things don't get any more encouraging.\n\nBitcoin's long march to $100,000?\n\nI think Bitcoin will eventually break through the $100,000 mark. But it could take longer than many people now expect. I'm basing my analysis on long-term secular trends happening in financial markets, such as Bitcoin's growing adoption as a form of payment, and Bitcoin's growing allocation in the portfolios of institutional investors.\n\nInvestors should be deeply skeptical of any argument that basically boils down to, \"The fiat money system has failed, now it's all clear for crypto.\" This argument is not just naive, but it also puts crypto investors into a difficult position. Who wants to root for bank failures and bank runs?\n\nKeep in mind that predicting the future of the economy is difficult. As legendary economist John Kenneth Galbraith once remarked, \"The only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.\" Nobody really knows what's going to happen with Bitcoin this year because nobody really knows what's going to happen with the economy. I'm bullish on Bitcoin long-term, but I also recognize that the path to $100,000 might be more difficult and more challenging than many crypto bulls now are willing to acknowledge."

However, some lawmakers at the federal level have criticized Texas\u2019 seemingly loose regulatory regime for the potential environmental impact caused by the energy consumption of mining firms.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin mining advocate is going state-to-state to educate US lawmakers\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott, reelected to another four-year term in November 2022, has previously referred to himself as a \u201ccrypto law proposal supporter\u201d in the state. According to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Texas was considering a ban on central bank digital currencies, both foreign and domestic, following a similar initiative announced by his office on March 20."

        "title": "Bitcoin Dominance 13767 - Daily Bruin",
        "content": "How Has Bitcoin Maintained Its Dominance Over Other Cryptocurrencies?\n\nBitcoin has been the dominant cryptocurrency for many years now, and it has shown no signs of slowing down. This is largely due to its innovative technology, which has enabled it to remain ahead of the competition. The blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin is highly secure and provides users with a way to transfer funds without going through a centralized authority. This means that transactions are faster and more secure than traditional methods.\n\nAnother factor that has kept Bitcoin at the top is its wide acceptance among merchants and users around the world. Nowadays, even the price of Bitcoin can be viewed by any trader anywhere in the world. As more businesses continue to accept Bitcoin as a payment method, this will only further increase its dominance over other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin also benefits from strong community support and development efforts from developers all over the world who are constantly improving its features and security measures. This keeps Bitcoin on top in terms of usability, reliability, and scalability compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nRelated: https://dailybruin.com/2023/03/01/bitcoin-market/\n\nWhat factors have contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s success so far?\n\nOne of the first things that have contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s success is its decentralized nature. Since it is not controlled by any government or institution, then no institution controls it. This has made it attractive to investors who are looking for an alternative to traditional banking systems. Bitcoin is a limited supply, which causes it to be both scarce and very valuable. Also, the fact that it is not controlled by any government or central bank has made it a safe-haven asset, especially in times of economic uncertainty. In addition, since Bitcoin uses blockchain technology, it is very secure, The transactions are typically recorded in a decentralized ledger, which is transparent. Moreover, it is very easy for prospective traders to assess Bitcoin, one only needs an internet connection and a digital wallet. This has increased its success rates so far. Finally, the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate form of payment by major retailers and businesses has also contributed to its success.\n\nWhat advantages does Bitcoin have over other cryptocurrencies?\n\nThe decentralization of Bitcoin is one of its main advantages. This means that no one can manipulate its supply or value, making it more secure than other forms of currency. Also, Bitcoin, due to its long history and standing as the first cryptocurrency, is well-known and thus more accepted. It is also very stable compared to other cryptocurrencies, which makes it less likely to be affected by news and events. This is when compared to altcoins. Bitcoin transactions are fast and secure due to its blockchain technology and encryption. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger that is distributed across multiple computers around the world. And, Bitcoin offers users greater privacy than other cryptocurrencies since all transactions are anonymous and untraceable.\n\nThe potential for future growth in Bitcoin\u2019s popularity\n\nBitcoin has been gaining traction in recent years, and its potential for future growth is something that many people are interested in. Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain technology provides a secure platform for transactions, making it an attractive option for those looking to make secure payments online. As more businesses begin to accept it as a form of payment, its use will become increasingly widespread and accepted by mainstream society. Also, in future, Bitcoin may start to be accepted in mainstream finance, which hasn\u2019t happened fully currently. Furthermore, with the increased technological advances where Bitcoin is concerned, Bitcoin may continue to be used more and more regularly. Finally, with more countries beginning to recognize and regulate it and other cryptocurrencies, the potential for the future growth of Bitcoin will only increase further."

        "title": "Bitcoin tops $28,500 \u2013 experts predict where BTC is going next - CNBCTV18",
        "content": "Bitcoin has registered a strong rally over the last 10 days or so. The world\u2019s oldest and largest cryptocurrency has gained nearly 30 percent in valuation over the last week, hitting a 9-month high of $28,527 yesterday, March 20. After this surprising price trend, most investors and traders are wondering where the king coin will go from here. Can a push higher be expected or will the bears take over once again? Here\u2019s what the experts are saying.\n\nEnd of the bear market? Next stop $30,000?\n\nAfter Bitcoin\u2019s recent price spurt, several analysts believe the bear market has finally come to an end. Popular trader and podcast host, Scott Melker, sees BTC\u2019s recent price movement as a sign that good things are just around the corner. \u201cBTC made its first higher high ($25,212) since the all-time high . That confirms a new bullish trend. Price can still go down, but that would be a new trend, not a continuation of the previous bear market. Congrats everyone.\u201d\n\nAnother prominent analyst, Rekt Capital, supported this notion. Based on historic chart patterns, he believes that Bitcoin will confirm a new bull market in the coming weeks. \u201cJust under two weeks left until #BTC monthly closes above the Macro Downtrend to confirm a new Bull Market,\u201d he said in a tweet today.\n\nAs such, several crypto traders believe BTC will continue on its upward journey in the coming days. One such analyst, Crypto Tony, took to Twitter to shed light on the king token\u2019s future valuation. \u201c$27,700 ensured we are now in the next range between $27,700 - $31,000. Using $27,700 as a level that bulls need to hold to sustain a move up to the $30,000 level,\u201d he said in March 20 tweet. Another prominent trader, Crypto Chase, agrees with this bullish outlook, stating that BTC could land in the $33,000 to $35,000 range in the coming weeks.\n\nAll eyes are on the upcoming FOMC meeting\n\nA pivotal event that could influence the price of Bitcoin is the upcoming FOMC meeting. Scheduled for March 21-22, the meeting will see members of the Fed decide and announce U.S. interest rates for the coming month.\n\nIn 2022, the Federal Reserve raised rates by 75 basis points four consecutive times in a bid to curb record-high inflation. These rate hikes seemed to have borne fruit as inflation numbers declined for the first time in months in Dec 2022. This prompted the Fed to pivot from its aggressive rate hikes, opting for a hike of 0.50 percentage points in Dec, followed by a 0.25 increase in early February.\n\nHowever, on March 7, Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome H. Powell, said that the U.S. central bank was likely to raise rates higher than expected. \u201cThe latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,\u201d said Powell in an appearance at Capitol Hill. Just this statement caused crypto prices to drop, with BTC slipping below $22,000 following Powell\u2019s announcement.\n\nHowever, the banking crisis that unravelled over the next few days could change this outlook. Several of the biggest financial institutes believe that the Fed could go back on its interest rate hike to ease the pressure on the banking sector. For instance, the popular investment bank, Goldman Sachs believes that, instead of an aggressive rate hike, interest rates will plateau.\n\nThe global investment bank, Nomura, takes things one step further, stating that the Fed could opt to cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points owing to \"looming financial stability risks.\u201d Historically, every time interest rates are lowered, BTC tends to rally. Therefore a rate cut could send BTC spiking.\n\nFear and greed index backs narrative of further gains\n\nThe fear and greed index is a numeric representation of market sentiment toward Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry. It is measured on a scale of 1 to 100, where 1 indicates an extremely fearful market whereas 100 points toward high investor confidence. Recent reports indicate that Bitcoin has recorded its highest fear and greed score this year, touching 68 on March 20. The last time it reached this level was in Nov 21, around the same time BTC touched its all-time high.\n\nThis investor confidence is evident from a recent poll conducted by Santiment. The analytics platform took to Twitter asking users where BTC was headed next. Unsurprisingly, more than half of the 1,000 voters believed the king coin would go above $30,000 in the coming days.\n\nAnticipation around Bitcoin\u2019s halving\n\nBitcoin is scheduled for its halving event in March 2024. This will reduce the block reward to 3.125 BTC. Lowering the amount of Bitcoin entering circulation could cause prices to spike. Keeping this in mind, a leading crypto financial services platform, Matrixport, believes that BTC could surge toward the end of the year. In a recently published report, the platform predicted that BTC could touch $45,000 by the end of the year.\n\nThe wildest prediction\n\nThe wildest Bitcoin prediction comes from ex-Coinbase CTO, Balaji Srinivasan, who believes that BTC would touch $1 million within 90 days. This was after a JP Morgan report indicated that the U.S. Fed would inject $2 trillion as part of its new bank backstop program. \"The Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) was created to support American businesses and households by making additional funding available to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks can meet the needs of all their depositors,\" the Fed said in a press release.\n\nSrinivasan believes that the Fed\u2019s move to \u201cprint $2 trillion\u201d will \u201chyperinflate the dollar.\u201d Therefore, as a protective measure, Srinivasan is encouraging users to \u201cbuy bitcoin now and get your coins off exchanges.\u201d He also made a $2 million bet with two Twitter users that BTC would touch $1 million in 90 days. That translates into a 3,600 percent increase in a matter of months.\n\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin is marching strong in 2023. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was changing hands at $27,627 per unit. That works out to a 67 percent increase since the start of the year. However, where the coin is headed from here is anyone\u2019s guess. Crypto markets are highly volatile and can move against even the strongest indicators. Therefore, it is important to do your own research and invest only as much as you can afford to lose completely."

        "content": "Bitcoin ATM maker General Bytes disclosed that unidentified threat actors stole cryptocurrency from hot wallets by exploiting a zero-day security flaw in its software.\n\n\"The attacker was able to upload his own java application remotely via the master service interface used by terminals to upload videos and run it using 'batm' user privileges,\" the company said in an advisory published over the weekend.\n\n\"The attacker scanned the Digital Ocean cloud hosting IP address space and identified running CAS services on ports 7741, including the General Bytes Cloud service and other GB ATM operators running their servers on Digital Ocean,\" it further added.\n\nThe company said that the server to which the malicious Java application was uploaded was by default configured to start applications present in the deployment folder (\"/batm/app/admin/standalone/deployments/\").\n\nIn doing so, the attack allowed the threat actor to access the database; read and decrypt API keys used to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges; send funds from the wallets; download usernames, password hashes, and turn off two-factor authentication (2FA); and even access terminal event logs.\n\nGeneral Bytes, according to its website, has sold more than 15,137 terminals in 149 countries. It supports over 180 fiat currencies and has collectively performed nearly 22.6 million transactions worldwide.\n\nThe BATMs are designed to connect to a crypto application server (CAS), which are either managed by the customer or by the company itself on the cloud via infrastructure provided by DigitalOcean.\n\nIt also warned that its own cloud service as well as other operators' standalone servers were infiltrated as a result of the incident, prompting the company to shutter the service.\n\nIn addition to urging customers to keep their crypto application servers (CASs) behind a firewall and a VPN, it's also recommending to rotate all users' passwords and API keys to exchanges and hot wallets.\n\n\"The CAS security fix is provided in two server patch releases, 20221118.48 and 20230120.44,\" General Bytes said in the advisory.\n\nThe company further emphasized that it had conducted multiple security audits since 2021 and that none of them flagged this vulnerability. It appears to have been unpatched since version 20210401.\n\nGeneral Bytes did not disclose the exact amount of funds stolen by the hackers, but an analysis of the cryptocurrency wallets used in the attack reveals the receipt of 56.283 BTC ($1.5 million), 21.823 ETH ($36,500), and 1,219.183 LTC ($96,500).\n\nThe ATM hack is the second breach targeting General Bytes in less than a year, with another zero-day flaw in its ATM servers exploited to steal crypto from its customers in August 2022."

        "content": "Hackers drained millions of dollars in digital coins from cryptocurrency ATMs by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, leaving customers on the hook for losses that can\u2019t be reversed, the kiosk manufacturer has revealed.\n\nThe heist targeted ATMs sold by General Bytes, a company with multiple locations throughout the world. These BATMs, short for bitcoin ATMs, can be set up in convenience stores and other businesses to allow people to exchange bitcoin for other currencies and vice versa. Customers connect the BATMs to a crypto application server (CAS) that they can manage or, until now, that General Bytes could manage for them. For reasons that aren\u2019t entirely clear, the BATMs offer an option that allows customers to upload videos from the terminal to the CAS using a mechanism known as the master server interface.\n\nGoing, going, gone\n\nOver the weekend, General Bytes revealed that more than $1.5 million worth of bitcoin had been drained from CASes operated by the company and by customers. To pull off the heist, an unknown threat actor exploited a previously unknown vulnerability that allowed it to use this interface to upload and execute a malicious Java application. The actor then drained various hot wallets of about 56 BTC, worth roughly $1.5 million. General Bytes patched the vulnerability 15 hours after learning of it, but due to the way cryptocurrencies work, the losses were unrecoverable.\n\nGeneral Bytes officials wrote:\n\nThe night of 17-18 March was the most challenging time for us and some of our clients. The entire team has been working around the clock to collect all data regarding the security breach and is continuously working to resolve all cases to help clients back online and continue to operate their ATMs as soon as possible. We apologize for what happened and will review all our security procedures and are currently doing everything we can to keep our affected customers afloat.\n\nThe post said the flow of the attack was:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The attacker identified a security vulnerability in the master service interface the BATMs use to upload videos to the CAS. 2. The attacker scanned the IP address space managed by cloud host DigitalOcean Ocean to identify running CAS services on ports 7741, including the General Bytes Cloud service and other BATM operators running their servers on Digital Ocean. 3. Exploiting the vulnerability, the attacker uploaded the Java application directly to the application server used by the admin interface. The application server was, by default, configured to start applications in its deployment folder.\n\nOnce the malicious application executed on a server, the threat actor was able to (1) access the database, (2) read and decrypt encoded API keys needed to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges, (3) transfer funds from hot wallets to a wallet controlled by the threat actor, (4) download user names and password hashes and turn off 2FA, and (5) access terminal event logs and scan for instances where customers scanned private keys at the ATM. The sensitive data in step 5 had been logged by older versions of ATM software.\n\nBATM customers on their own now\n\nGoing forward, this weekend\u2019s post said, General Bytes will no longer manage CASes on behalf of customers. That means terminal holders will have to manage the servers themselves. The company is also in the process of collecting data from customers to validate all losses related to the hack, performing an internal investigation, and cooperating with authorities in an attempt to identify the threat actor.\n\nGeneral Bytes said the company has received \u201cmultiple security audits since 2021,\u201d and that none of them detected the vulnerability exploited. The company is now in the process of seeking further help in securing its BATMs.\n\nThe incident underscores the risk of storing cryptocurrencies in Internet-accessible wallets, commonly called hot wallets. Over the years, hot wallets have been illegally drained of untold amounts of digital coin by attackers who exploit various vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency infrastructures or by tricking wallet holders into providing the encryption keys required to make withdrawals.\n\nSecurity practitioners have long advised people to store funds in cold wallets, meaning they\u2019re not directly accessible to the Internet. Unfortunately, BATMs and other types of cryptocurrency ATMs generally can\u2019t follow this best practice because the terminals must be connected to hot wallets so that they can make transactions in real time. That means BATMs are likely to remain a prime target for hackers."

Source: Blockchain.com\n\nAs shown above, just 531 or 11.56% of the 4,593 days were unprofitable for long-term holders. The unprofitable days are between Dec. 28, 2022, and June 12, 2022, a time when Bitcoin was priced above the $26,246.58 and $28,344.5 range.\n\nThe revelation highlights the importance of understanding Bitcoin\u2019s market cycles and why investors should avoid buying the tops and selling the dips. However, some traders prefer making daily trades on crypto exchanges for much smaller but consistent profits.\n\nIn a recent publication, Cointelegraph detailed the different types of crypto investors and categorized them based on their investment mindset.

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\n\"Bitcoin NFTs\" have taken off over the last two months thanks to the launch of Ordinals, a protocol that lets people digitally imprint media and text on the original blockchain\u2014with more than 500,000 such \u201cinscriptions\u201d made to date. Now, one of the leading NFT marketplaces on other chains has made a move to support Bitcoin, as well.\n\nMagic Eden, the largest Solana NFT marketplace, announced today that it has added support for Bitcoin Ordinals. It\u2019s the latest multi-chain move for the startup\u2014which was valued at $1.6 billion as of June 2022\u2014after expanding to Ethereum and Polygon last year.\n\nOrdinals are a relatively new breakthrough for Bitcoin, enabling the on-chain storage of media without the use of smart contracts as on other chains, and much of the tooling is still being built in real time. As a result, minting, handling, and trading Ordinals is a more complicated process than on other chains like Ethereum and Solana, thanks in part to the lack of infrastructure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven so, Magic Eden says that its Ordinals marketplace experience will be similar to what users are used to experiencing on its platform.\n\nAs a non-custodial marketplace, Magic Eden itself never takes control of assets being traded, and it will support the Ordinals-compatible Hiro and Xverse wallets at launch. Magic Eden claims that it is the first fully audited Ordinals marketplace.\n\n\u201cThe core marketplace functionality should feel really, really similar for users, and hopefully it gives people the perception that the [Ordinals] hurdle is not crazy,\u201d said Magic Eden co-founder and COO Zhuoxun Yun. \u201cAs long as I have a little bit of Bitcoin in my wallet, I can just get going and it would feel the same as if I'm trying to try to buy something on ETH.\u201d\n\nMagic Eden\u2019s marketplace launch suggests that Ordinals tooling and infrastructure are spinning up quickly. As recently as early February, when Bitcoin NFT buzz was first heating up, some traders were using public spreadsheets and Airtable forms to coordinate asking prices and trades, since formal marketplaces still hadn\u2019t been developed.\n\nThe first Bitcoin Ordinals marketplaces, including ORDX and Generative, launched later in February, with others joining the fray since\u2014including Gamma, a marketplace first established for NFTs on Stacks, a Bitcoin scaling network. Trustless marketplaces, including the Magic Eden one, are a big step up for Ordinals in terms of security, accessibility, and scalability.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYun said that interest from creators will help dictate the future direction for Magic Eden\u2019s Bitcoin marketplace. It\u2019s still relatively early days for Ordinals, but even so, the limitations of the protocol suggest that it\u2019s a better fit for some types of on-chain assets\u2014like limited edition artwork\u2014than others, such as large-scale video game NFT collections.\n\nStill, Magic Eden already has some plans ahead. Right now, the Ordinals marketplace is focused on secondary market sales, but the firm plans to offer future tools for minting (or inscribing) digital assets onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Yun said it\u2019s still unclear whether that will take the form of a minting launchpad, which it offers on Solana and other platforms, or auctions.\n\nIgor Milihram, who handles business development for Magic Eden, said that the idea of inscribing digital artifacts on Bitcoin lit a spark under the team, who \u201cfell in love\u201d with the idea of Bitcoin NFTs. Having the artwork stored fully on-chain gives Ordinals a different value proposition than some other NFT chains, too.\n\n\u201cIt stays on every node, forever,\u201d he told Decrypt. \u201cEven if the apocalypse hits, there will be computers that will have Bitcoin on their hard [drives], and they will be able to spin it up. It's kind of undestroyable in that way. And that gives those assets more value.\u201d"

        "content": "The leader of a prominent banking company offered some harsh criticism of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) in 2017. While criticism is nothing new, the person who made the comments at the time is generating interest in these comments made more than five years ago.\n\nWhat Happened: Swiss bank Credit Suisse AG (NYSE:CS) is among the banking giants that have struggled in recent months. The troubles eventually led to the bank being bought out by Swiss peer UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) at a discount.\n\nWith several banks collapsing and questions about the banking industry, some experts have suggested investment in the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cRich Dad, Poor Dad\u201d author Robert Kiyosaki has told investors to buy gold, silver and Bitcoin with banks in trouble.\n\nThe leader of one of the banks in trouble spoke out against Bitcoin in 2017, something fans of the cryptocurrency haven\u2019t forgotten.\n\nTidjane Thiam, the former CEO of Credit Suisse, called Bitcoin a bubble while speaking at a press conference on Nov. 2, 2017, CoinDesk reported.\n\n\u201cFrom what we can identity, the only reason today to buy or sell Bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble,\u201d Thiam said.\n\nThiam also mentioned the close links to Bitcoin and crime saying that banks like Credit Suisse \u201chave little or no appetite to get involved in a currency which has such anti-money laundering challenges.\u201d\n\nThiam is not the only critic of Bitcoin. Other prominent investors such as Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio have spoken out against Bitcoin, with Buffett referring to the cryptocurrency as \u201crat poison squared.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has been one of the banking CEOs speaking out against Bitcoin for years.\n\nThiam resigned from Credit Suisse in February 2020, after being CEO since March 2015. Thiam is now the chairman of Freedom Acquisition I Corp (NYSE:FACT), a SPAC merging with Complete Solaria, a solar company.\n\nWhile Credit Suisse was not led by Thiam recently, Twitter user Joe Burnett, an analyst at Blockware Solutions, shared the details.\n\n\u201cOver 5 years ago, the CEO of Credit Suisse called Bitcoin a bubble. Since then, BTC is up 318% and Credit Suisse just sold for 1/5 the size of Dogecoin,\u201d Burnett tweeted.\n\nThe tweet generated a face with tears of joy emoji response from Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, the CEO and co-founder of Binance.\n\nRelated Link: How To Buy Bitcoin\n\nInvesting $1,000 in Bitcoin: Hearing the CEO of one of the largest banks in the world call Bitcoin a bubble might have scared many investors away. The comments also might have led some investors to believe that they could get in before major banks catch onto the capabilities and investment cases for cryptocurrency.\n\nWith Bitcoin trading at $6,758.72 on Nov. 2, 2017, a person could have bought 0.1480 BTC with $1,000. The same $1,000 investment would be worth $4,151.97.\n\nThis represents a return of 315.2% in a period of 5.33 years for an average annual return of 59.1%.\n\nInvestors could have listened to the comments about Bitcoin being a bubble and invested the $1,000 in shares of Credit Suisse instead. A $1,000 investment could have purchased 61.5 shares of Credit Suisse at the time.\n\nThe $1,000 investment in Credit Suisse would be worth $60.28 today based on a price of 98 cents per share at the time of writing. This represents a loss of 93.9% on the investment, or an average annual loss of 17.6%.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500, is up 155.2% over the same time period, representing an average annual gain of 29.1%.\n\nRead Next: 10 Things Credit Suisse Is Older Than: Light Bulbs, Telephones, Radios, Sports Leagues And More\n\nPhoto: Marko Aliaksandr via Shutterstock\n\n\n\n"

        "title": "Mt. Gox creditor saga: What lessons has the Bitcoin community learned? - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In the early days of Bitcoin, Mt. Gox was by far the most prominent Bitcoin (BTC) exchange in the world. The Tokyo-based company was responsible for more than 70% of all Bitcoin transactions in 2013. However, by early 2014, it had collapsed spectacularly, leaving investors and traders with losses amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe downfall of Mt. Gox was a defining moment in the history of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, with several regulators, market analysts and industry experts continuing to study the case to prevent such instances in the future. Moreover, the saga has continued to serve as a cautionary tale for the cryptocurrency industry, highlighting the potential risks and pitfalls associated with digital currency trading and investments.\n\nMt. Gox: The early years\n\nMt. Gox was launched in 2010 by Jed McCaleb, a programmer and entrepreneur who had previously founded the file-sharing network eDonkey2000. At the time, Bitcoin was still a niche technology that was largely unknown outside of a small group of enthusiasts and developers. Mt. Gox was one of the first exchanges that allowed users to buy and sell Bitcoin for fiat assets, thereby quickly amassing a high degree of popularity among early adopters and traders.\n\nRecent: 4 out of 10 NFT sales are fake: Learn to spot the signs of wash trading\n\nIn 2011, McCaleb sold Mt. Gox to Mark Karpeles, a French software developer who had previously worked on various projects, including an online marketplace called \u201cMagic: The Gathering Online Exchange.\u201d Karpeles moved the company\u2019s headquarters to Tokyo and began to expand its operations, opening up new markets and adding support for additional cryptocurrencies. This transformed Mt. Gox into the most prominent crypto trading ecosystem of the early 2010s.\n\nThe hack\n\nIn February 2014, Mt. Gox abruptly halted all withdrawals from its platform, citing technical issues and security concerns. The company\u2019s website went offline, and rumors circulated that the exchange had been hacked. A few days later, Karpeles held a press conference in Tokyo where he confirmed that Mt. Gox had indeed been hacked, and miscreants had stolen 850,000 Bitcoin \u2014 worth approximately $450 million at the time.\n\nThe Mt. Gox hack was one of the largest thefts in the history of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and it had a significant impact on the broader industry. The price of Bitcoin dropped sharply in the days following the announcement, with many investors and traders losing confidence in the security and reliability of digital currency exchanges.\n\nMt. Gox hack aftermath\n\nIn the months following the Mt. Gox hack, there was great uncertainty and confusion about what had happened to the stolen Bitcoin, and who was responsible for the theft. Karpeles initially claimed that the coins had been stolen due to a \u201cbug\u201d in Mt. Gox\u2019s software, but experts and members of the Bitcoin community widely criticized this explanation.\n\nIn March 2014, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan, and Japanese authorities seized the company\u2019s assets. Karpeles was eventually arrested and charged with embezzlement and fraud in connection with the exchange\u2019s collapse, but he has consistently maintained his innocence, claiming that he was simply a victim of circumstances beyond his control.\n\nLogarithmic Bitcoin price chart on Mt. Gox from February 2012\u2013February 2014. Source: Bitcoincharts\n\nThe Mt. Gox bankruptcy proceedings were complicated and protracted, with multiple legal challenges and competing claims from creditors and investors. In 2018, a Japanese court ruled that Mt. Gox\u2019s assets should be liquidated and distributed among its creditors \u2014 a process that is still ongoing.\n\nHow are the reimbursement proceedings going?\n\nIn 2018, after several years of legal battles and investigations, a Japanese court approved a plan to compensate the victims of the Mt. Gox hack. The plan, which a court-appointed trustee proposed, called for the creation of a trust to hold the remaining Bitcoin and distribute them to the creditors. The trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, was tasked with overseeing the distribution of the remaining funds.\n\nThe first step in the plan was to convert the remaining Bitcoin into cash. The trustee sold over 35,000 BTC and 34,000 Bitcoin Cash (BCH) on various cryptocurrency exchanges, raising over $400 million. This was a significant achievement, as it represented the largest sale of cryptocurrency by a single entity in history.\n\nDelays galore\n\nIn March 2020, the trustee announced that a new system had been implemented to allow creditors to make claims for the remaining funds. Creditors were required to submit proof of their claim, including documentation such as bank statements, transaction records and identification documents. The deadline for submitting claims was set for October 2020, which was subsequently pushed back to December.\n\nIn December 2020, the trustee announced that it had received claims from 99.9% of the creditors. The total amount of claims submitted was approximately $16 billion, which was significantly higher than the remaining funds available for distribution. This presented a significant challenge for Kobayashi, as he had to determine how to distribute the remaining funds fairly.\n\nIn January 2021, the trustee submitted a draft rehabilitation plan to the court. The plan proposed that the remaining funds be distributed in Bitcoin rather than cash, as this would avoid the need to sell the remaining cryptocurrency and risk affecting the market. The plan also proposed that the creditors be given the option to receive reimbursement in Bitcoin or cash, with the conversion rate based on the market price at the time of distribution.\n\nAs expected, the proposed rehabilitation plan received mixed reactions from the creditors. Some creditors welcomed the plan, as it offered the possibility of a higher reimbursement if the price of Bitcoin increased. However, others were skeptical, as the value of Bitcoin is highly volatile and subject to significant fluctuations. Some creditors also expressed concerns about the potential tax implications of receiving reimbursement in Bitcoin.\n\nRecent developments\n\nDuring the first week of September 2022, Kobayashi announced that former Mt. Gox customers had until Sept. 15 to make or transfer a claim. This date was then pushed back to Jan. 10, 2023, with Kobayashi urging creditors to complete the necessary steps before the deadline.\n\nKobayashi informed creditors that those individuals who failed to do so would be unable to receive their funds quickly or would be required to supply several documents to the firm\u2019s head office in Japan. Even then, they would only be able to receive payments in Japanese yen.\n\nHowever, the deadline was moved to March 10, citing the \u201cprogress by rehabilitation creditors\u201d in the selection and registration as a reason for the change. In fact, as part of a March 7 announcement, the trustee reiterated a January notice reminding creditors who had not registered for repayment that they had until March 10 to do so \u2014 two additional months as part of the rehabilitation plan proposed earlier.\n\nKobayashi did not provide a reason for the extension, which would allow individuals who suffered losses at Mt. Gox to select a repayment method and register their information in an online rehabilitation claim filing system.\n\nAdditionally, it bears mentioning that amid all these changes, Mt. Gox Investment Fund \u2014 the largest creditor of the defunct crypto exchange \u2014 opted for an early payout in Bitcoin rather than wait longer for a larger payment after a legal battle. The early payout meant creditors would receive approximately 90% of what was due. The bankruptcy trustee doesn\u2019t have to sell tokens to acquire fiat funds for the payment since the creditor also chose to be paid in BTC.\n\nMost recently, the timeline for filing claims and distribution of assets to Mt. Gox creditors seems to have been amended again. As per an official announcement, the deadline for filing claims has been extended by another month, from March 10 to April 6, 2023, allowing creditors to register their claims for an additional period. The distribution of assets has also been pushed back by another month, with the process now starting on Oct. 31 instead of Sept. 30.\n\nThe official statement released by the Mt. Gox trustee cited several reasons for the delay in the deadlines, including the progress made by rehabilitation creditors in terms of selection and registration. Creditors have multiple options for receiving payments, including a lump-sum payment, bank remittance, via a transfer service provider or a cryptocurrency exchange or custodian.\n\nLessons learned and looking ahead\n\nOne crucial lesson learned from the Mt. Gox collapse is the value of transparency and accountability. Many critics argued that the hack\u2019s severity was partly due to the exchange\u2019s opacity and secrecy regarding its operations. Nowadays, reputable cryptocurrency exchanges are relatively more transparent, with some frequently publishing audits and reports to reassure customers and investors.\n\nRecent: Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s downfall has many causes, but crypto isn\u2019t one\n\nAnother lesson from the Mt. Gox failure was the need for better risk management and financial controls. In the early days of Bitcoin, many exchanges were run by tech enthusiasts and entrepreneurs with little to no experience in finance or risk management. Today, exchanges have more professional and experienced management teams implementing better financial controls and risk management practices.\n\nLastly, the Mt. Gox hack revealed the necessity for improved regulation and oversight of the cryptocurrency industry. Since the collapse, regulators worldwide have proposed new rules and regulations to protect investors and traders, including stricter Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer requirements. While some may view these regulations as excessively restrictive, others believe they are necessary to prevent fraud and safeguard consumers.\n\nThe Mt. Gox incident continues to serve as a cautionary tale regarding digital assets\u2019 potential risks and dangers, emphasizing the need for greater transparency, accountability and risk management."

As such, the collection has engaged with the Ordinals project to bring some of its NFTs onto the undisputed king of distributed ledgers.\n\nFor a start, DeGods will bridge a small portion of its digital collectibles to Bitcoin as part of its long-term vision. At least that is the sentiment of Kevin Henrikson, CEO of Dust Labs, the platform behind DeGods. By doing this, the project hopes to introduce a first-of-its-kind minting experience for fans of the project, on the oldest blockchain network in operation.\n\nAll of the successful minters of the BTC DeGods will be sent their inscriptions immediately after the mint. You will then be free to list it on any marketplace or use our dedicated OTC trading desk in our Discord. Best of luck to everyone. \u2014 DeGods III (@DeGodsNFT) March 17, 2023\n\nLast December, DeGods offered collectors the chance to migrate their NFTs to the Ethereum network. It\u2019s news that wasn\u2019t well received within the Solana community, where the project is native. But, as Henrikson notes, DeGod\u2019s mission is to be the leading NFT community on all chains.\n\n\u201cFirst Solana, now Bitcoin, and soon Polygon and Ethereum once we migrate and grow on those chains. We aren\u2019t just trying to go to every chain but are being thoughtful and purposeful on how it can extend our vision.\u201d\n\nDeGods on Bitcoin\n\nThat said, the latest crossover is dubbed \u201cDeGods on Bitcoin.\u201d As of March 17, the project intended to burn 535 NFTs and mint them on Bitcoin. Of that number, 500 digital avatars will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, and potential bidders will require at least 0.444 BTC or $12,464, as of press time to participate.\n\nThe remaining 35 items will be auctioned for $DUST, the community\u2019s utility token, with all proceeds donated to the DustDAO. The decentralized autonomous organization will be formed to govern the $DUST token after DeGods merges with y00ts.\n\nBy bridging to Bitcoin, DeGods follows in the footsteps of other popular collections that have taken the same route, such as CryptoPunks and OnChainMonkey.\n\nWant more?

Raising rates would keep inflation in check but further punish the economy, possibly unleashing a new wave of bank failures.\n\n\u201cNext week's FOMC is gearing up to be one of the most interesting ones in a while, with no one really agreeing on what's gonna happen,\u201d engineer and trader Tree of Alpha summarized.\n\n\u201cOdds at leaning towards 25bps, but it\u2019s a wildcard. Planning on longing <=0bps and shorting >=50 bps as the safe play.\u201d\n\nAccording to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch Tool, the consensus as of March 20 favors the Fed hiking by 25 basis points, rather than pausing hikes altogether. The week prior, Goldman Sachs predicted that rates would plateau, while Nomura even forecasted a rate cut.\n\nFed target rate probabilities chart. Source: CME Group\n\n\u201cThis week, the long anticipated March Fed interest rate decision comes out. Currently, markets are pricing in a 62% chance of a 25 bps rate hike. However, markets also see 100 bps of rate cuts by December,\u201d wrote financial commentary resource The Kobeissi Letter in part of an analysis of the long-term rate hike roadmap.\n\nKobeissi and others also queried how struggling bank stocks would react at the next Wall Street open, given the latest government moves over the weekend, including a buyout of Credit Suisse, the European banking giant that saw a particularly violent reaction to the U.S. meltdown.\n\n\u201cCredit Suisse, $CS, was worth $10 billion a month ago and sold for pennies on the Dollar,\u201d Kobeissi continued, speaking on fellow bank UBS purchasing Credit Suisse and getting $100 billion in government liquidity.\n\n\u201cThe government said $CS had \u2018serious risk of bankruptcy.\u2019 A shareholder vote was bypassed. Regulators knew it was a matter of hours for bankruptcy. This deal was made out of desperation.\u201d\n\nBitcoin spot price eyes $30,000\n\nWith that, the mood on Bitcoin and crypto markets has understandably taken a fresh turn for the better as the week begins.\n\nAt the time of writing, BTC/USD traded above $28,400, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour candle chart (Bitstamp). Source: TradingView\n\nAlready at nine-month highs, the pair managed to beat out bears during a consolidation period last week to return to target levels not seen in almost a year.\n\nChief among these is $30,000, a psychologically significant level surrounded by considerable historical liquidity.

        "content": "There are plenty of military puns in operating system history.\n\nUnix famously has a whole raft of personnel known as Major Number, who organise the batallions of devices such as disk drives, keyboards and webcams in your system.\n\nMicrosoft once struggled with the apparently incompetent General Failure, who was regularly spotted trying to read your DOS disks and failing.\n\nLinux has intermittently has trouble with Colonel Panic, whose appearance is typically followed by lost data, potentially damaged file systems, and an urgent need to turn off the power and reboot your computer.\n\nAnd a Czech cryptocurrency company doesn\u2019t seem to be getting the sort of reliability you might reasonably expect from a personality called General Bytes.\n\nActually, General Bytes is the name of the company itself, a business that sadly is no stranger to unwanted intrusions and unauthorised access to cryptocurrency funds.\n\nOnce is misfortune\n\nIn August 2022, we wrote how General Bytes had fallen victim to a server-side bug in which remote attackers could trick a customer\u2019s ATM server into giving them access to the \u201cset up a brand new system\u201d configuration pages.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever reflashed an iPhone or an Android device, you\u2019ll know that the person who performs the original setup ends up with control over the device, notably because they get to configure the primary user and to choose a brand new lock code or passphrase during the process.\n\nHowever, you\u2019ll also know that modern mobile phones forcibly wipe the old contents of the device, including all of the old user\u2019s data, before they reinstall and reconfigure the operating system, apps, and system settings.\n\nIn other words, you can start again, but you can\u2019t take over where the last user left off, otherwise you could use a system reflash (or a DFU, short for device firmware upgrade, as Apple calls it) to get at the previous owner\u2019s files.\n\nIn the General Bytes ATM server, however, the unauthorised access path that got the attackers into the \u201cstart from scratch\u201d setup screens didn\u2019t neutralise any data on the infiltrated device first\u2026\n\n\u2026so the crooks could abuse the server\u2019s \u201cset up a new administrative account\u201d process to create an additional admin user on an existing system.\n\nTwice looks like carelessness\n\nLast time, General Bytes suffered what you might call a malwareless attack, where the criminals didn\u2019t implant any malicious code.\n\nThe 2022 attack was orchestrated simply through malevolent configuration changes, with the underlying operating system and server software left untouched.\n\nThis time, the attackers used a more conventional approach that relied on an implant: malicious software, or malware for short, that was uploaded via a security loophole and then used as what you might call an \u201calternative control panel\u201d.\n\nIn plain English: the crooks found a bug that allowed them to install a backdoor so they could get in thereafter without permission.\n\nAs General Bytes put it:\n\nThe attacker was able to upload his own Java application remotely via the master service interface used by terminals to upload videos and run it using batm user privileges.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure why an ATM needs a remote image-and-video upload option, as though it were some sort of community blogging site or social media service\u2026\n\n\u2026but it seems that the Coin ATM Server system does include just such a feature, presumbly so that ads and other special offers can be promoted directly to customers who visit the ATMs.\n\nUploads that aren\u2019t what they seem\n\nUnfortunately, any server that allows uploads, even if they come from a trusted (or at least an authenticated source) needs to be careful of several things:\n\nUploads need to be written into a staging area where they can\u2019t immediately be read back from outside. This helps to ensure that untrustworthy users can\u2019t turn your server into a temporary delivery system for unauthorised or inappropriate content via a URL that looks legitimate because it has the imprimatur of your brand.\n\nThis helps to ensure that untrustworthy users can\u2019t turn your server into a temporary delivery system for unauthorised or inappropriate content via a URL that looks legitimate because it has the imprimatur of your brand. Uploads need to be vetted to ensure they match the file types allowed. This helps stop rogue users from booby-trapping your upload area by littering it with scripts or programs that might later end up getting executed on the server rather than simply served up to a subsequent visitor.\n\nThis helps stop rogue users from booby-trapping your upload area by littering it with scripts or programs that might later end up getting executed on the server rather than simply served up to a subsequent visitor. Uploads need to be saved with the most restrictive access permissions feasible, so that booby-trapped or corrupt files can\u2019t inadverently be executed or even accessed from more secure parts of the system.\n\nGeneral Bytes, it seems, didn\u2019t take these precautions, with the result that the attackers were able to perform a wide range of privacy-busting and cryptocurrency-ripping actions.\n\nThe malicious activity apparently included: reading and decrypting authentication codes used to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges; sending funds from hot wallets; downloading usernames and password hashes; retrieving customer\u2019s cryptographic keys; turning off 2FA; and accessing event logs.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nIf you run General Bytes Coin ATM systems, read the company\u2019s breach report, which tells you how to look for so-called IoCs (indicators of compromise), and what to do while you wait for patches to be published.\n\nNote that the company has confirmed that both standalone Coin ATM Servers and its own cloud-based systems (where you pay General Bytes a 0.5% levy on all transactions in return for them running your servers for you) were affected.\n\nIntriguingly, General Bytes reports that it will be \u201cshuttering its cloud service\u201d, and insisting that \u201cyou\u2019ll need to install your own standalone server\u201d. (The report doesn\u2019t give a deadline, but the company is already actively offering migration support.)\n\nIn an about-turn that will take the company in the opposite direction to most other contemporary service-oriented companies, General Bytes insists that \u201cit is theoretically (and practically) impossible to secure a system granting access to multiple operators at the same time where some of them are bad actors.\u201d\n\nIf you have used a General Bytes ATM recently, contact your cryptocurrency exchange or exchanges for advice about what to do, and whether any of your funds are at risk.\n\nIf you are a programmer looking after an online service, whether it\u2019s self-hosted or cloud-hosted, read and heed our advice above about uploads and upload directories.\n\nIf you\u2019re a cryptocurrency enthusiast, keep as little of your cryptocoin stash as you can in so-called hot wallets.\n\nHot wallets are essentially funds that are ready to trade at a moment\u2019s notice (perhaps automatically), and typically require either that you entrust your own cryptographic keys to someone else, or temporarily transfer funds into one or more of their wallets."

        "content": "Most cryptocurrencies have gained momentum in the recent days with Bitcoin price hovering above the $28,000 level for the first time since June 2022. The largest digital coin has gained roughly 25% since March 8, when signs first emerged of trouble around Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which has since folded and ignited turmoil among other lenders.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has been experiencing a surge in value over the past few days due to instability in the banking sector, higher-than-expected inflation data, and renewed confidence in a dovish Federal Reserve, bringing it to its highest level in approximately nine months. The global crypto market was valued at US$1.18 trillion during this period. On Monday, major central banks made coordinated moves, including the Federal Reserve to improve market liquidity. This might have also contributed to the upward sentiment in the market,\" said Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO at Mudrex.\n\nThe crypto market experienced a bounce last week. The pump, as per experts was caused by a combination of factors, including a massive short squeeze, a billion-dollar buy by Binance, and the Fed's response to the banking crisis, and news on Ethereum\u2019s update.\n\n\u201cAccording to Block statistics, nearly $300 million in leveraged BTC short positions were liquidated in the last week. This amounts to more than $300 million in buying pressure for BTC. During a bear market, this is quite substantial because it doesn't take nearly as much money to drive prices up or down. Binance's conversion of $1 billion in BUSD into BTC, ETH, BNB, and other unnamed cryptocurrencies is likely to have contributed to the recent rise. Another reason is the official announcement of the Ethereum Shanghai hard fork update date (April 12), which will allow users to withdraw their staked Eth and is expected to stimulate Ethereum market demand,\" said Rajagopal Menon Vice president WazirX.\n\n\"However, caution remains the need of the hour as the banking sector news can still impact market sentiments. Regulators may continue to make it difficult for banks to process crypto-related transactions, as has been the case with Signature bank. Another thing to look out for will be the Fed's meeting on Wednesday,\" said Parth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "title": "Investors shelter in short-term Treasurys, reducing Bitcoin's chance of rallying to $30K - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $28,000 on March 21, but according to two derivatives metrics, traders aren\u2019t very ecstatic after a 36% gain in eight days. Looking beyond Bitcoin\u2019s stellar performance, there are reasons investors are not fully confident in further price upside. The recent rescue of Credit Suisse, a 167-year-old leading Swiss financial institution, is proof that the current global banking crisis might not be over.\n\nOn March 19, Swiss authorities announced that UBS had agreed to acquire rival Credit Suisse in an \u201cemergency rescue\u201d merger in order to avoid further market-shaking turmoil in the global banking sector. The transaction could benefit from more than $280 billion in state and central bank support, which is equivalent to one-third of Switzerland\u2019s gross domestic product. Unfortunately, there is no way to portray this agreement as reassuring or as a sign of strength from financial institutions, including central banks.\n\nThe same can be said for the emergency credit lifeline provided by the United States Treasury to protect the banking sector and increase Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reserves. The \u201cBank Term Funding Program\u201d (BTFP), launched on March 12, marked a return to Fed liquidity injections, reversing the trend initiated in June 2022, when the Federal Reserve began monthly asset sales.\n\nThe global banking crisis prompted the Fed to abandon its inflation-control policies\n\nBy lending $300 billion in emergency funds to banks, the Fed completely reversed its strategy to curb inflation, which has been above 5% year-over-year since June 2021, whereas the target is 2%. This strategy, known as tightening, included increasing interest rates and reducing the $4.8 trillion in assets the Federal Reserve accumulated from March 2020 to April 2022.\n\nOn March 20, First Republic Bank (FRB) saw its credit ratings downgraded further into junk status by S&P Global, adding to the stress on United States\u2019 regional banks. According to the risk agency, the lender\u2019s recent $30 billion deposit infusion from 11 large banks may not be enough to solve the FRB\u2019s liquidity problems.\n\nInvestors in cryptocurrencies are always anticipating a decoupling from the traditional markets. Nonetheless, there are few justifications for an allocation at the moment, especially if coming from corporations, mutual fund managers or wealthy investors. Historically, investors tend to hoard cash positions or short-term government debt instruments during recessionary periods in order to sustain day-to-day operations and possibly be used to purchase bargains.\n\nThe yield on six-month U.S. Treasurys, for example, decreased from 5.33% on March 9 to 4.80% on March 20. As investors prepare for the impact of inflation or a recession, or both, this development indicates a greater demand for short-term instruments. The change since March 9 reversed the entire movement from 2023, with the indicator closing 2022 at 4.77%.\n\nLet\u2019s examine Bitcoin derivatives metrics to determine the current market position of professional traders.\n\nBitcoin derivatives exhibit a balanced demand for long and short positions\n\nBitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks, which typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement for a longer period.\n\nAs a result, futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5%\u201310% annualized premium \u2014 a situation known as \u201ccontango,\u201d which is not unique to crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas\n\nSince March 15, the BTC futures premium indicator has remained unchanged at 2.2%, indicating no additional demand from leveraged buying activity. Numbers below 5% indicate pessimism, which is not what one would anticipate after price gains of 36% in eight days.\n\nThe absence of demand for leverage longs does not necessarily imply a price decline. As a result, traders should investigate Bitcoin\u2019s options markets to learn how whales and market makers value the likelihood of future price movements.\n\nThe 25% delta skew is a telling sign showing when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection. In bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 8%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -8%, meaning the bearish put options are in less demand.\n\nBitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas\n\nThe delta skew crossed the neutral -8% threshold on March 19, indicating moderate optimism as neutral-to-bullish call options were in higher demand. The excitement, however, did not last long, as the 25% skew indicator is currently at -8%, which is the edge of a balanced situation. Nonetheless, it is the polar opposite of the previous week, when the skew reached 12% on March 13.\n\nUltimately, professional Bitcoin traders are not bullish above $26,000. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but unless crypto investors regain confidence, the chances of the cryptocurrency surpassing $30,000 remain extremely remote. A complete breakdown of the banking system would cause investors to flee to safety rather than seek out risk.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Secure your seat today\n\nThis article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk\u2019s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.\n\nLatest Prices\n\nTop Stories\n\nBitcoin climbed 4% in the past 24 hours to above $28,000 for the first time since last June as some traders see the cryptocurrency as a hedge against the traditional banking system, which has had its share of troubles over the past few weeks, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and regulators' takeover of Signature Bank. On Sunday, the Federal Reserve announced it had joined with other major central banks to ensure a steady flow of the U.S. dollar, a dominant reserve currency, in the global financial system. Bitcoin was up 25% this month through Sunday.\n\nNon-crypto-related deposits held by former Signature Bank (now Signature Bridge Bank) will be assumed by Flagstar Bank, a subsidiary of New York Community Bancorp, as of Monday under a purchase and assumption agreement, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said in a press release on Sunday. Signature Bridge Bank depositors \u2013 other than depositors related to the digital banking business \u2013 will automatically become depositors of Flagstar, and will continue to be insured by the FDIC up to the insurance limit. Flagstar Bank's bid didn't include $4 billion of deposits related to the former Signature Bank's digital banking business.\n\nThe dollar value locked in the number of open bitcoin futures contracts is rising, signifying increased speculative interest in the market and potential for price volatility. Data from Coinglass shows the nominal value of open interest has reached a yearly high of $12 billion, marking a 7% gain for the month. An increase in open interest means new money is flowing into the market but doesn't reveal much about whether traders are getting in position for price gains or losses. In bitcoin's case, the new money seems to be betting on price gains, considering the funding rate or the cost of holding bullish long/bearish short positions has flipped into the green after spending most of the early parts of the Asian trading day in the red.\n\nStory continues\n\nChart of the Day\n\nThe chart shows bitcoin's rolling 30-day correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies.\n\nThe negative correlation has recently weakened amid U.S. bank failures that have complicated the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation.\n\nTrending Posts"

        "content": "Bitcoin is breaking free.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 3% rally in the last 24 hours has caught the eye of investors searching for a bright spot in a market roiled by banking chaos. Notably, the world\u2019s most valuable cryptocurrency is decoupling from stocks.\n\nIn the last seven days, it has soared 28% even as the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index eked out a 1.5% total return, according to data from CoinGecko and Morningstar.\n\nBitcoin has also performed twice as well as Ether, the native token for the Ethereum smart contracts network, which usually marches in lockstep with its bigger sibling.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nOver the last few years Bitcoin has closely tracked stocks, especially technology shares, as a \u201crisk on\u201d asset.\n\n\u201cExtra liquidity, that\u2019s the difference,\u201d between now and back when Bitcoin closely tracked higher risk assets such as the Nasdaq Composite Index, Markus Thielen, head of crypto research and strategy at Matrixport, told DL News.\n\n\u201cIt went risk-on when the Fed provided deposit guarantees and traders realised that liquidity would be pumped into the system,\u201d even as \u201csome parts of the economy are in stress,\u201d including banks, he said. \u201cThis is helping Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is surging (CoinMarketCap)\n\nFor quarter after quarter, cryptocurrency investors have been waiting for Bitcoin to deliver on its primary mission \u2013 to provide a reliable hedge against the machinations of central banks and the traditional financial system.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nNow, thanks to the banking crisis that started with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and engulfed the Swiss banking system over the weekend with UBS\u2019s emergency takeover of Credit Suisse, Bitcoin is finally coming through.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the crypto safe haven,\u201d said Philippe Bekhazi, the CEO of Stablehouse, a Bermuda-based trading and custody platform.\n\n\u2018The market is now pricing in that central banks will be cutting rates aggressively later this year.\u2019\n\nThis is largely due to Bitcoin\u2019s record as an unhacked blockchain, Bekhazi said. Even as numerous DeFi protocols have been plundered for billions of dollars in the last 12 months and \u201cecosystems\u201d such as Terra have cratered, the 14-year-old digital currency has chugged along with little drama.\n\nStill, the biggest knock on BTC has been its habit of mirroring the moves of stocks and responding to the Fed\u2019s fight to curb inflation with rising raising interest rates.\n\nA research study published by Georgetown University last July found that Bitcoin\u2019s correlation with the S&P 500 jumped 58% in 2021 and the first half of 2022.\n\nAnd an analysis by Fundstrat Global Advisors, a New York-based research boutique, concluded in 2022 that Bitcoin\u2019s correlation was running close to 1 with a Nasdaq index that tracks high-growth tech stocks.\n\nNOW READ: Bitcoin ignores macro moves, says the NY Fed. Experts disagree\n\nThis behaviour damaged Bitcoin\u2019s credibility as a form of \u201cdigital gold\u201d that could provide investors with a safe harbour during times of financial or geopolitical strife.\n\nNow Bitcoin may not just be providing relief to whipsawed investors, it\u2019s also a key indicator for what\u2019s to come as bank authorities race to stabilise the crisis.\n\n\u201cThe market is now pricing in that central banks will be cutting rates aggressively later this year,\u201d Juan Correa-Ossa, associate vice president for BCA Research, a provider of global macro research, told DL News. This tends to be positive for assets with no cash flow, such as Bitcoin and gold.\n\nBitcoin dominance\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin\u2019s share of the $1.2 trillion crypto market\u2019s capitalisation, a measure known as Bitcoin dominance, has jumped to 46% from 41% over the past 10 days while that of other major cryptocurrencies have remained flat or declined.\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, a European investment and trading group, said customers are increasingly seeing Bitcoin as a safe haven asset.\n\n\u201cGiven that the futures market has significantly shifted from anticipating a 50 to 75 basis point rate hike this year to potentially expecting 100 basis points of rate cuts (attributable to the banking crisis), this change has also been highly supportive of Bitcoin prices,\u201d he told DL News.\n\nAnother force to reckon with is counterparty risk. Correa-Ossa said that investors may be hedging against the risks of trading partners, or counterparties, which may be struggling to stay solvent. He cautioned that this applies to self-custodied Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering that Bitcoin was invented during the Great Financial Crisis bailouts,\u201d Correa-Ossa said."

        "title": "GBTC: The One Place to Buy Bitcoin for 58 Cents on the Dollar - Entrepreneur",
        "content": "The biggest Bitcoin closed-end fund trades at a deep discount to its assets, driven by nearly two years of hedge fund liquidations. Is GBTC turning the corner?\n\nThis story originally appeared on MarketBeat\n\nBitcoin is breaking out above its critical $25,000 level, which has been acting as stubborn upside resistance for the last nine months. Briefly trading above $27,000 on Friday morning, Bitcoin looks like it's trying to mount another bull trend.\n\nLike gold, Bitcoin is a proxy for skepticism of fractional reserve banking and fiat currency. With two large US banks failing this week as the government steps in to bail them out, it's no surprise that Bitcoin is rallying.\n\nAnd the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCMKTS: GBTC) is the most efficient way to play the Bitcoin rally. The trust trades at a whopping 42% discount to Bitcoin in the fund, which means you're buying Bitcoin for 58 cents on the dollar, and you can do it through your brokerage account.\n\nThere are also some exciting catalysts on the cusp for the fund, as Grayscale, the fund's manager, is in a court battle with the SEC to convert the trust into an ETF.\n\nWhat is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust?\n\nThe Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCMKTS: GBTC) is a publicly-traded fund that holds Bitcoin. The entire idea of the fund is to provide investors with a way to invest in Bitcoin without the compliance and custodianship concerns that come with buying and storing the actual crypto tokens.\n\nGBTC operates as a closed-end fund, similar to an ETF. Still, for some technical reasons, which we'll get into later, it can trade at substantial premiums or discounts to its net asset value (NAV), unlike an ETF. Throughout the fund's history, it has traded at a significant premium to its NAV due to its convenience and compliance.\n\nWhy Is It Trading at a Discount?\n\nAs a closed-end, GBTC lacks the built-in arbitrage mechanism that allows market makers to create and destroy shares at will to bring the fund's price in line with its net asset value. Between 2017 and 2021, this fact, combined with GBTC being the only avenue for institutional investors to access Bitcoin, led the fund to trade at a sustained premium.\n\nHistorically, GBTC at an average premium of about 20%.\n\nHedge funds capitalized on this premium by executing a straightforward arbitrage trade. They bought GBTC directly from Grayscale in a private placement, allowing them to purchase at NAV. However, there was a catch: they had to wait 6 months before selling the shares. As long as the premium persisted, the trade yielded considerable profits.\n\nBut investors won't pay a premium forever. Eventually, GBTC's premium to its Bitcoin holdings began to decline, creating losses for hedge funds, who, in many cases, borrowed lots of money to make the arbitrage trade.\n\nThe resulting margin calls led to a widespread liquidation of GBTC for over a year. However, the current deep discount offers a significant margin of safety, and two catalysts in play could close the discount.\n\nThree Catalysts to Close the Discount\n\nThe SEC Lawsuit: Vying for a Bitcoin ETF\n\nGrayscale has been trying to turn GBTC into an ETF for a long time, but the SEC continually turns them down. The fund manager is now suing the regulator after it rejected its application to convert GBTC into a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nGrayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said the company was \"really encouraged\" after giving the DC Circuit Court of Appeals oral arguments.\n\nGBTC converting to a spot Bitcoin ETF would mean the fund would almost immediately start trading at its net asset value.\n\nShareholders Suing Grayscale\n\nA number of shareholders have been suing Grayscale to get the company to take action to close the fund's deep discount to its net asset value (NAV). Fir Tree Partners, a hedge fund, is in a legal battle with Grayscale.\n\nThe hedge fund claims that Grayscale prohibits redemptions of its fund for its gains and recommends that Grayscale initiate a tender offer to buy shares at net asset value.\n\nSuppose activist investors like Fir Tree can apply enough pressure on Grayscale. In that case, they might have to start acting to redeem some shareholder value.\n\nA Bitcoin Bull Market\n\nBitcoin has been on an aggressive rally to start the year. This month, it was given additional tailwinds with the spat of bank failures and government intervention in the financial system. Despite the bullish price action, the classic conditions of a Bitcoin hype train aren't in place yet, meaning the discount on Grayscale hasn't yet closed.\n\nIf Bitcoin continues to rally and the hype train returns, the GBTC discount will likely narrow."

        "content": "Leading Bitcoin ATM maker General Bytes disclosed that hackers stole cryptocurrency from the company and its customers using a zero-day vulnerability in its BATM management platform.\n\nGeneral Bytes makes Bitcoin ATMs allowing people to purchase or sell over 40 cryptocurrencies. Customers can deploy their ATMs using standalone management servers or General Bytes cloud service.\n\nOver the weekend, the company disclosed that hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability tracked as BATM-4780 to remotely uploaded a Java application via ATM's master service interface and run it with 'batm' user privileges.\n\n\"The attacker scanned the Digital Ocean cloud hosting IP address space and identified running CAS services on ports 7741, including the General Bytes Cloud service and other GB ATM operators running their servers on Digital Ocean (our recommended cloud hosting provider),\" General Bytes explained in a security incident disclosure.\n\nThe company took to Twitter to urge customers to \"take immediate action\" and install the latest updates to protect their servers and funds from attackers.\n\nAfter uploading the Java application, the threat actors gained able to perform the following actions on compromised devices:\n\nAbility to access the database.\n\nAbility to read and decrypt API keys used to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges.\n\nSend funds from hot wallets.\n\nDownload user names, their password hashes and turn off 2FA.\n\nAbility to access terminal event logs and scan for any instance where customers scanned private keys at the ATM. Older versions of ATM software were logging this information.\n\nGeneral Bytes warned that its customers and its own cloud service were breached during the attacks.\n\n\"GENERAL BYTES Cloud service was breached as well as other operator's standalone servers,\" highlights the statement.\n\nAlthough the company disclosed how much money the attacker stole, they provided a list of cryptocurrency addresses used by the hacker during the attack.\n\nThese addresses show that the hacker began stealing cryptocurrency from Bitcoin ATM servers on March 17th, with the attacker's Bitcoin address receiving 56.28570959 BTC, worth approximately $1,589,000, and 21.79436191 Ethereum, worth roughly $39,000.\n\nWhile the Bitcoin wallet still contains the stolen cryptocurrency, the threat actors appear to have used Uniswap to convert the stolen Ethereum into USDT.\n\nUpgrade servers now\n\nCAS (Crypto Application Server) admins are urged to examine their \"master.log\" and \"admin.log\" log files for any suspicious gaps in time caused by the attacker deleting log entries to conceal their actions on the device.\n\nGeneral Byte's report also warned that the uploaded malicious JAVA applications would appear in the \"/batm/app/admin/standalone/deployments/\" folder as random-named .war and .war.deployed files, as shown below.\n\nThe company notes that the file names are likely different per victim.\n\nFiles (red) dropped by the attacker on breached servers (General Bytes)\n\nThose without signs of a breach should still consider all their CAS passwords and API keys compromised and immediately invalidate them and generate new ones. All user passwords should also be reset.\n\nDetailed step-by-step instructions for all server operators on protecting their endpoints are enclosed in the company's statement.\n\nShuttering the cloud service\n\nGeneral Bytes says they are shuttering its cloud service, stating it finds it \"theoretically (and practically) impossible\" to secure it from bad actors when it must simultaneously provide access to multiple operators.\n\nThe company will provide support with data migration to those who would like to install their own standalone CAS, which should now be placed behind a firewall and VPN.\n\nGeneral Byte has also released a CAS security fix that addresses the exploited vulnerability, provided in two patches, 20221118.48 and 20230120.44.\n\nIt also highlights that the breached system underwent multiple security audits since 2021, but none identified the exploited vulnerability.\n\nFurthermore, researchers from the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange found multiple vulnerabilities in General Bytes' ATMs in 2021, which the company quickly fixed\n\nHowever, even with these security audits, in August 2022, General Bytes had a security incident where hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in its ATM servers to steal cryptocurrency from its customers.\n\nThe company says its plans to conduct numerous security audits of its products by multiple companies in a short period to discover and fix other potential flaws before bad actors find them."

        "content": "Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, has rallied up to 40 per cent ever since the collapse of multiple much-vaunted global financial institutions. The cryptocurrency breached the $28,000 mark for the first time after June 2022, fueled by investor\u2019s distrust in the banking system after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank, Silvergate, and Credit Suisse Bank.\n\nCoinDCX Research Team enlisted the reasons for the current crypto rally and their future outlook for the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cIn recent times, Bitcoin has experienced a significant surge in its value, rising by more than 28% over the last week and trading at $28,000. The BTC dominance has also reached an all-time high of 44.4 per cent after six to eight months. This sudden increase in price has been attributed to various factors, including the long-term trend of accumulation during dips below $20,000 and the liquidity crisis faced by the banking sector,\u201d they told Business Today.\n\nParth Chaturvedi, Crypto Ecosystem Lead, CoinSwitch explained that despite the rally, volatility in the digital currency cannot be ruled out.\n\n\u201cIt was heartwarming to see the crypto market rise against all odds last week. Despite the many sell-offs in global equities and 'risky assets,' Bitcoin (BTC) finally broke out of the $20,000- $25,000 range it was trading in for weeks,\u201d he told Business Today.\n\nHe added: \"However, caution remains the need of the hour as the banking sector news can still impact market sentiments. Regulators may continue to make it difficult for banks to process crypto-related transactions, as has been the case with Signature Bank. Another thing to look out for will be the Fed's meeting on Wednesday.\"\n\nThe CoinDCX Research Team spoke about the outlook for other crypto tokens: \u201cIn the wake of this, more investors may currently consider Bitcoin as a safe haven asset. This could result in Bitcoin\u2019s value continuing to rise to levels beyond $30,000 in the near future. Additionally, crypto projects with good developments like ETH, MATIC, LIDO Finance, and UNISWAP are expected to see significant traction in the coming days.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Bitcoin was trading at $27,561 as per data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nAlso Watch: Binance\u2019s Executive Explains How To Secure Your Funds In Crypto - BT TV BusinessToday\n\nAlso Read: 'Are they sharks or loan sharks?'

Cardano proponents argue that the Ethereum-killer altcoin is ready for a bull run to its $100 target while cynics continue to criticize former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan\u2019s $1 million Bitcoin bet.\n\nAlso read: Breaking: Coinbase argues core staking services are not securities in its letter to SEC\n\nWhy crypto experts are betting big on $1 million Bitcoin and $100 Cardano\n\nThe US Federal Reserve\u2019s battle against rising inflation and the collapse of two of the United State\u2019s largest banks, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Silvergate, sent shock waves through market participants.\n\nInterestingly, the US Central Bank\u2019s latest decision to coordinate with central banks and enhance provisions for the liquidity of the US Dollar have raised concern among traders.\n\nThe US Fed took steps to guarantee deposits of all banks in its economy and assisted the banking system with nearly half the amount that it did during the 2008 crisis. According to Fortune, the Central Bank allocated $143 billion to holding companies for failed banks and lent $148 billion through a discount window program.\n\nThe Fed inaugurated its Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) and lent $11.9 billion to help banks raise funds to meet the needs of all depositors and increased the frequency of its swap operations from weekly to daily for the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s liquidity injection in its banking system is considered bullish for decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The steps taken by the central bank are drastic when compared to the Covid crisis of 2020 and the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn light of these moves by the largest central bank in the world, experts like former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan and BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes have turned bullish on Bitcoin. Srinivasan recently made headlines for his $1 million Bitcoin bet. The expert predicted that BTC price is likely to hit $1 million within 90 days.\n\nI will take that bet.\n\nYou buy 1 BTC.\n\nI will send $1M USD.\n\nThis is ~40:1 odds as 1 BTC is worth ~$26k.\n\nThe term is 90 days.\n\nAll we need is a mutually agreed custodian who will still be there to settle this in the event of digital dollar devaluation.\n\nIf someone knows how to do this\u2026 https://t.co/tcuBNd679T pic.twitter.com/6Aav9KeJpe \u2014 Balaji (@balajis) March 17, 2023\n\nSrinivasan challenged pseudonymous analyst James Medlock on Twitter that the US Dollar will enter hyperinflation within 90 days, for a $1 million bet.\n\nAs the $1 million Bitcoin bet garnered backing and criticism both on crypto Twitter, Cardano proponents put forth the $100 ADA narrative, on similar lines.\n\n@LucidCIC, a Cardano proponent and crypto influencer on Twitter is bullish on both Bitcoin and Cardano for their decentralization.\n\nLet's breakdown what has everyone calling for a $1,000,000 $BTC and a $100 $ADA:\n\n\n\n: Banks never recovered financially from the lockdowns.\n\n\n\n: Banks and the government continued printing more fiat.\n\n\n\n: We did not stop inflation by raising rates but scared everyone without a\u2026 https://t.co/1lVxydrZgS \u2014 Lucid (@LucidCiC) March 20, 2023\n\nWhat makes Cardano an alternative to investors hit by banking crises?\n\nExperts supporting the $100 Cardano narrative argue that the Ethereum alternative blockchain is more decentralized than most other Proof-of-Stake blockchains, including ETH. To substantiate this claim, it is key to identify the Nakamoto coefficient or Minimum Attack Vector (MAV), a metric that determines the decentralization of validator nodes.\n\nA validator node verifies transactions and adds new blocks to the blockchain. Its decentralization helps determine how decentralized a blockchain network is. As of December 2022, Cardano had a MAV of 24 and Ethereum a MAV of 3.\n\nMAV of Cardano and Ethereum\n\nThe above data substantiates the claim that Cardano is eight times more decentralized than the Ethereum network. Stakers on the ADA network have full custody of their assets while staking on a hardware wallet. They delegate voting power to a staking pool operator of their choice while their ADA tokens are stored securely in a hardware wallet.\n\nCardano\u2019s uncomplicated staking process has made it a popular choice among crypto market participants. Further, the ADA blockchain\u2019s decentralization and utility make it an ideal choice for investors looking for avenues to hold their funds during the banking crises, according to Lucid.\n\nIf Cardano misses its $100 target, what\u2019s next?\n\nThe Ethereum-killer blockchain noted a spike in whale activity over the past week. Based on data from crypto intelligence tracker IntoTheBlock, the number of transactions exceeding $100,000 hit a seven-day high above 5,000 on March 13.\n\nWhale activity on Cardano\n\nTypically, an increase in activity by large wallet investors is indicative of rising selling pressure on the asset and a subsequent correction in its price. In the short-term, following the two announcements by the US Federal Reserve discussed in the opening, ADA price failed to register a significant reaction.\n\nAs seen in the Cardano/TetherUS three-day chart below, ADA is exchanging hands at $0.33. In the event of a correction, ADA price could plummet to support at $0.23.\n\nADA/USDT 3D price chart\n\nCardano faces immediate resistance at $0.43 and $0.77 in its uptrend. The first bullish target is the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level of $0.91. In the past thirty days, ADA yielded 16.7% losses for holders."

        "content": "Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal believes that Balaji Srinivasan\u2019s bet on Bitcoin hitting $1 million within 90 days is a marketing trick.\n\nPal talked about crypto failures such as FTX, U.S. government\u2019s pushbacks against crypto, and Srinivasan\u2019s bet on Bitcoin hitting $1 million within 90 days.\n\nOn 20 March, entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano \u201cPomp\u201d invited Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal to his podcast, where he quizzed the latter on a range of topics surrounding Bitcoin [BTC] and its numerous run-ins with regulatory bodies.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cBitcoin and the 2023 Financial Crisis,\u201d Pal talked about crypto failures such as FTX, U.S. government\u2019s pushbacks against crypto, and former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan\u2019s bet on Bitcoin hitting $1 million within 90 days.\n\nRegarding the recent collapse of the crypto-friendly Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Pomp asked Pal if we should compare its collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in November last year. Pal pointed out that, though it\u2019s true that both institutions made poor investments. However, the crucial difference is that while SVB is a bank, FTX is only a brokerage. While SVB had the right, as a banking institution, to invest in customer funds, FTX had, as a crypto brokerage firm, no right to invest customer funds.\n\nPal also pointed out that even as banks have been disallowed from engaging in prop trading, FTX was doing essentially that with customer money.\n\nPomp asked Pal why the United States government was pushing against cryptocurrency. Pal responded that the U.S. government understands cryptocurrency and is acutely aware of the gigantic impact of possible bank runs as a potential result of Bitcoin\u2019s popularity. It is for this reason that the U.S. government is pushing back against mass adoption of cryptocurrency through bringing in a lot of rules and regulations.\n\nThe crypto industry has been dealing with multiple failures such as Terra [LUNA], Three Arrows Capital, Celsius, Voyager Digital and FTX since 2022. In addition, hacking attempts have continued to plague crypto platforms. Due to such incidents, customers have lost millions of dollars so far.\n\nPomp also asked Pal if the U.S. government will use the Reserve to buy Bitcoin to assuage market panic. Pal answered in the negative, saying that unlike the countries in the Middle-East, the U.S. government will not be buying Bitcoin as it is an extremely volatile asset.\n\nPal also pushed forward his own \u201ctheory\u201d that Satoshi Nakamoto is nobody but a state actor, which created Bitcoin as an alternative financial system just in case the mainstream banking system fails; in fact, these bodies already own Bitcoin, Pal proposed.\n\nCan Bitcoin hit $1 million?\n\nTowards the end of the podcast, Pal put worth his views on Balaji Srinivasan\u2019s bet on Bitcoin hitting $1 million within 90 days.\n\nPal said:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s [Srinivasan] has got 0.0% chance of being right.\u201d\n\nI will take that bet.\n\nYou buy 1 BTC.\n\nI will send $1M USD.\n\nThis is ~40:1 odds as 1 BTC is worth ~$26k.\n\nThe term is 90 days.\n\nAll we need is a mutually agreed custodian who will still be there to settle this in the event of digital dollar devaluation.\n\nIf someone knows how to do this\u2026 https://t.co/tcuBNd679T pic.twitter.com/6Aav9KeJpe \u2014 Balaji (@balajis) March 17, 2023\n\nSrinivasan believes that as traditional currencies enter a period of rapid hyperinflation, the global economy will turn to Bitcoin as digital gold as the new, preferred currency.\n\nPal said that it is Srinivasan\u2019s marketing trick to spread around the concept of hyper-bitcoinization. He, however, added that it could happen within 12 months but it\u2019s not appropriate to put a date, he cautioned."

        "content": "Crypto entrepreneur Bobby Lee has gifted Bruce Willis some bitcoin in Ballet wallets.\n\nThe digital coins were handed to him as Christmas gifts for his daughters.\n\nCrypto investors and celebrities invested in digital currencies are increasing awareness efforts.\n\nAction movie star Bruce Willis has received a surprise gift after bumping into bitcoin crusader, Bobby Lee. Lee is the CEO and co-founder of BTC China. His company, BTCC, was founded in 2011 and is credited as the first bitcoin exchange in the country. Most recently Lee launched the Ballet cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nNarrating the encounter on Twitter, Lee said that he was lucky to have sat next to the veteran actor while on a plane to China. He seized the moment to introduce bitcoin and his company\u2019s Ballet crypto wallets to the 64-year-old Hollywood star. The investor also transferred 0.01 BTC to two gold-plated wallets via Wi-Fi, which he handed to Willis as Christmas gifts for his two daughters.\n\nIn another post, Bobby Lee additionally revealed that he had gifted Dr. Ron Paul, a former Texas Congressman, some BTC loaded on a gold-plated Ballet crypto wallet bearing a serial number matching his birthday.\n\nBruce Willis and Ron Paul join a growing list of celebrities who own bitcoin. Another notable name of a star who is seemingly deeply invested in cryptocurrencies includes Ashton Kutcher. He is a co-founder at A-Grade Investments, a firm that also backs BitPay . Bitpay allows merchants to accept payments in bitcoin.\n\nIn May last year, Kutcher surprised show-host Ellen DeGeneres with a $4 million donation to her charity in XRP. The donation was made on behalf of Ripple, the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency.\n\nThe wealthiest celebrities in crypto circles right now are Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Widely known as the Winklevoss twins, the two venture capitalists are also former Olympics participants and are believed to own a bitcoin stash valued at over $1 billion.\n\nEfforts to Increase Crypto Awareness\n\nCelebrities involved in crypto, as well as famous investors, are becoming more active in increasing crypto awareness. Current survey reports indicate that bitcoin and cryptocurrency awareness is rising but remains low among the general population. According to one such study carried out by The Harris Poll, only about 11 percent of the American population owns cryptocurrencies.\n\nA previous report by Finder found that men were twice as likely as women to buy cryptocurrencies. It also established that cryptocurrencies were more prevalent among millennials than Baby Boomer and Gen X generations.\n\nAs such, Bruce Willis can be excused for not being enlivened by the prospect of owning cryptocurrencies."

        "content": "Bitcoin was close to nine-month highs on Monday and had its best week in four years as the global banking crisis drives some investors to turn to digital assets.\n\nThe biggest cryptocurrency by market value hit its highest since June 12 on Sunday at $28,474.\n\nIt rose 26% last week and is up more than 35% in ten days as turmoil in the banking sector has rippled around the globe \u2014 beginning with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and culminating, so far, in the UBS takeover of Credit Suisse at a discount over the weekend.\n\nOverall this week, Bitcoin has gained over 37% against the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization added $194 billion in 2023, representing a 66% gain year-to-date, outperforming Wall Street banks\u2019 stocks.\n\nBitcoin is up about 65% so far this year, versus the S&P 500\u2019s 2.5% gain and Nasdaq\u2019s 15% decline in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe momentum is all driven by liquidity, as bitcoin is an alternative liquidity vehicle,\u201d Markus Thielson, head of research and strategy at digital asset financial services firm Matrixport based in Singapore, told Reuters.\n\nBitcoin \u201ccan hit $45,000\u201d by year\u2019s end following the banking crisis\n\nHe expects bitcoin can hit $45,000 by the year\u2019s end, with liquidity from central banks finding its way into crypto assets, much as it did during 2021, when bitcoin scaled record heights.\n\nCredit Suisse was acquired by the UBS Group for nearly $2 billion on Sunday as part of emergency plans led by Swiss authorities to preserve the country\u2019s financial stability. As part of the agreement, the Swiss National Bank committed to providing over $100 billion in liquidity to UBS.\n\nThe $2 billion deal represents a considerable discount under Credit Suisse\u2019s market value on March 17 of nearly $8 billion, according to data from Companies Market Cap.\n\nCredit Suisse shareholders will be largely wiped out, receiving the equivalent of just 0.76 Swiss francs in UBS shares for stock that was worth 1.86 Swiss francs on Friday. Owners of $17 billion worth of \u201cadditional tier one\u201d bonds \u2014 a riskier class of bank debt \u2014 will lose everything, Swiss regulators said.\n\nChristine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, said she welcomed the \u201cswift action\u201d of the Swiss authorities.\n\nHer comments were echoed in the US, where Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Board chairman Jerome Powell both said the move supported \u201cfinancial stability\u201d.\n\nCredit Suisse had been losing the trust of investors and customers for years. In 2022, it recorded its worst loss since the global financial crisis.\n\nBut confidence collapsed last week after it acknowledged \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d in its bookkeeping and as the demise of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank spread fear about weaker institutions at a time when soaring interest rates have undermined the value of some financial assets.\n\nShares in the 167-year-old bank fell 25% over the week, money poured from investment funds it manages, and at one point account holders were withdrawing deposits of more than $10 billion per day, the Financial Times reported. An emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the bleeding."

        "title": "$28.7K Could Be Next Level To Break For Bitcoin, Here\u2019s Why - NewsBTC",
        "content": "On-chain data suggests the $28,700 mark, which Bitcoin has yet to hit since the LUNA collapse, could be the next major obstacle to clear for the asset.\n\nBitcoin Has Been Under The $28,700 Level For 310 Days Now\n\nAccording to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the $28,700 is the cost basis (that is, the acquisition price) of a specific whale group in the BTC market. The relevant indicator here is the \u201crealized price,\u201d a value derived from the realized cap, a capitalization model for Bitcoin.\n\nInstead of taking the value of each coin in the circulating BTC supply the same as the current asset price, the realized cap assumes that the \u201cactual\u201d value of any coin is the price at which it was last transacted on the chain.\n\nThe realized price is obtained when this metric is divided by the total number of coins in circulation. As the realized cap accounted for the price at which holders bought their coins, that is to say, their cost basis, what the realized price signifies is the cost basis of the average investor in the market.\n\nIn the context of the current topic, the realized price has been applied to three whale cohorts to find their average acquisition prices. To better identify the price at which these whales first bought their coins, Glassnode has used their exchange withdrawal transactions as the point at which they acquired their Bitcoin (as exchanges are what holders generally use for buying purposes).\n\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin realized price of these whale groups over the last couple of years:\n\nThe price seems to be approaching the highest of these levels | Source: Glassnode on Twitter\n\nWhales have been put into these three groups based on the period they bought their coins. For example, the 12 March 2020 cohort includes all whales that have acquired their coins between now and then.\n\nAs shown in the above graph, the 5 July 2017 whale group has the lowest cost basis at $18,000, below which BTC was stuck during the lows after the FTX collapse. Sometime later, the coin attempted to put together a rise and get above this level, but it found rejection.\n\nHowever, with the rally this year, BTC finally broke through this level. The rise continued until the cryptocurrency tested the 16 December 2018 whales\u2019 cost basis of $23,800 and found resistance.\n\nFrom the chart, it\u2019s apparent that the asset struggled around this mark for a while until the sharp price surge of the past week took place, and the asset managed to clear this level.\n\nNow, Bitcoin\u2019s price is above the $28,000 mark, and the coin is fast approaching the cost basis of the final cohort, the 12 March 2020 whales. Given that the other two whale groups provided resistance to the price, it\u2019s possible that the $28,700 cost basis of the last group could also cause trouble to the asset.\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $28,000, up 9% in the last week.\n\nLooks like BTC has mostly consolidated today | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\n\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "content": "Bitcoin price is trading around $25,000, following a meltdown across the banking sector. The first ever cryptocurrency designed to allow individuals to be their own bank, has given banks a run for their money amidst a series of bank runs and collapses across the United States and the globe.\n\nTake a closer look at the crypto price charts you absolutely cannot miss.\n\nBitcoin Priced In Bank Shares Rockets To New All-Time High\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 during the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis by the still-unidentified Satoshi Nakamoto. Hidden within the Genesis block there is a message referencing the cover story on The Times about the second bailout for banks.\n\nThe message made Bitcoin\u2019s mission clear: remove the need for third-parties from the financial system and free humanity from the impact of greed and the elite. Essentially, the decentralized cryptocurrency-based protocol allows anyone to be their own bank, custody their own assets, and send and receive money without an intermediary like a bank.\n\nOver the last week, several banks nearly collapsed resulting in yet more bailouts some 14 years after the launch of the first ever cryptocurrency. The story rarely changes, with governments and central banks quick to swoop in and stop a crises from further developing.\n\nLike dominoes, several banks revealed major issues, ranging from Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, Signature Bank, and Credit Suisse. While the factors behind each instance varies, the end result was the same: customers realized they cannot trust the banks with their deposits. Signature Bank\u2019s story is a little bit more complex, and was potentially shuddered due to involvement with crypto.\n\nSince the ordeal began, Bitcoin has been on a tear priced in USD and other global currencies. BTC priced against bank shares? Well, that\u2019s a crypto price chart you simply must lay your eyes on.\n\nBitcoin versus Banks | BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nHistory In The Making As BTC Becomes The Answer\n\nThe monthly candles in the above chart in the chart above are especially impressive. BTCUSD increased 80% against CS shares, 95% against SBNY, 200% against SIVB shares, and a staggering 650% against Silvergate.\n\nThe last time BTCUSD rallied this hard against big banks was back in May of 2019. Bitcoin price saw its bear market bottom about five months before the big move versus banks. This cycle, BTCUSD made its most recent low in November 2022. Five months from then would be April 2023, and already we\u2019re seeing massive movements against the banking sector once again. Could the outperformance against banks signal a potential bottom in the crypto market?\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only way that the first ever crypto asset is beating banks. Even at prices of $25,000 per coin, Bitcoin has a larger market cap and total value than even the largest banks in the world, like JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America.\n\nWill the dominoes continue to fall across the banking sector? And could this be the start of a new bullish narrative in Bitcoin? The next month will be pivotal in changing the trend across crypto.\n\nFollow @TonyTheBullBTC on Twitter or join the TonyTradesBTC Telegram for exclusive daily market insights and technical analysis education.

As per Dune Analytics, the total number of Ordinals inscriptions hit 521,843 at the time of writing, with a staggering 58% of them getting minted in March alone.\n\nThe figure reached its all-time high on 9 March when more than 30,000 inscriptions were minted on a single day.\n\nFurthermore, the total transaction fees paid on the Bitcoin network more than doubled over the last two months.\n\nAs per data from Dune, out of the total fees collected by miners, Ordinals trading accounted for 22%.\n\nNotably, Ordinals focus on BTC\u2019s smallest units, satoshis. The protocol allows users to inscribe each satoshi with data. This data can include smart contracts which are then used to enable NFTs.\n\nWith BTC feeling the pinch of increased regulatory scrutiny, Bitcoin-native NFTs could provide it with the much-needed impetus in the long run.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nConcerns around congestion\n\nDespite its astounding rise, the Ordinals project has divided opinions in the crypto community with the BTC purists getting spooked by the idea of more network congestion, resulting in higher fees and slower transactions.\n\nTheir fears, though are not completely unfounded. At the time of writing, memory consumption per block exceeded the 300 MB limit by 366 MB, leading the blockchain to discard any transaction worth less than 3.07 sats/vB, or Satoshi per byte.\n\nHowever, more than 30,000 transactions were yet to be confirmed, indicating that the network slowed down considerably."

        "content": "A closely followed crypto strategist believes that Bitcoin (BTC) could now be in the midst of a consolidative period to set the stage for a parabolic rally.\n\nIn a new video, analyst Kevin Svenson tells his 124,200 Twitter followers that BTC may be in the process of building a base of buyers before printing gains of over 100%.\n\nAccording to Svenson, Bitcoin appears to be following the parabolic diagram after creating two bases of support. Traditionally, a parabolic asset creates three bases of support before launching a 2x rally in a short amount of time.\n\nSays Svenson,\n\n\u201cBitcoin, from $15,500 at the beginning of the year to where we are now currently at [$28,000]. Bitcoin has created two bases of support, and possibly we\u2019re about to create base three. Why is that important?\n\nIf you look at the parabolic diagram, it suggests after three bases of support were created within the parabola, the stock price then doubles, or in this case, the crypto price doubles after base three. This means we have a possible base being created around $30,000 and then double to $60,000, according to the textbook.\u201d\n\nThe analyst also says that Bitcoin looks strong as it continues to respect both its diagonal trendline and horizontal support on the four-hour chart.\n\n\u201cBitcoin \u2013 maintaining an aggressive bullish posture.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $28,114.\n\nDon't Miss a Beat \u2013 Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox\n\nFollow us on Twitter Facebook and Telegram\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

        "content": "Amid several bank collapses, the Bitcoin price exceeds US$27,000\n\nCryptocurrency prices are skyrocketing in the wake of the high-profile Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s collapse. Considering that, unlike stocks, cryptocurrencies are typically not backed by any tangible assets or operating cash flow of an underlying corporation, cryptocurrencies are among the riskiest potential trading. Hence, one might anticipate a decline in cryptocurrency if a lack of trust affects the markets. Conversely, the top cryptocurrency Bitcoin price increased after it was revealed that the U.S. government was insuring almost all deposits at the failing California bank and that depositors would receive their whole money back. As of writing the Bitcoin price exceeds US$27,000.\n\nBitcoin increased by 23% in a single week, and it recently reached its greatest levels in months, supporting the idea that it can act as a buffer against instability in the established financial system. Similar to many growth stocks, cryptocurrency is a hazardous asset that fluctuates based on changes in the direction of interest rates in the future. Trading tends to migrate into riskier assets when rates fall, but away from risky assets when rates increase. They now anticipate that the Fed\u2019s rate rises would decrease, if not come to an end entirely, from their ferocious pace of the previous year.\n\nWhile some regard this as a short-term rise, it appears that a larger price action is on the horizon. As is well known, Bitcoin is approaching the halving that takes place once every four years. The next halving is planned for 2024, while the previous one took place in 2020. It is clear from looking at price trends since the start that cryptocurrency is behaving similarly before and after the halving event. The price has so reached a pivotal point beyond which it has before experienced a significant increase.\n\nThe monthly chart above depicts how the BTC price has tracked a comparable price movement since 2014. The BTC price breaks its bullish grip after each halving and plunges precipitously to indicate the cycle\u2019s bottom. The price then experiences a noticeable bounce that sparks a tremendous upswing that drives it higher to set a new record high. Every time the price has halved, this pattern has appeared, and once the price crosses above the trend line, a similar rise is anticipated. Yet, future forecasts suggest that Bitcoin will continue to gain momentum for some future period. According to projections from a cryptocurrency exchange, the price of Bitcoin could reach about $30,000 by the end of 2023.\n\nIn addition, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) both experienced weekly gains of about 9.88% and 12%, correspondingly. The market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is $1.16 trillion, up 0.02% from yesterday.\n\nOn a larger scale, the price of BTC has done well, rising by more than 35% in the last seven days to trade at $27,340. The cryptocurrencies do not, however, seem to have fully tapped into the strength they have built up over the last few months. It\u2019s interesting to note that compared to Bitcoin, the growth of popular cryptocurrencies has increased less recently. So, taking into account the existing circumstances, it can be predicted that the price of Bitcoin (BTC) will continue to have a significant lead and may increase until it reaches its goal. Altcoins may continue to cluster and float in an\n\nJoin our WhatsApp and Telegram Community to Get Regular Top Tech Updates"

        "content": "CoinReporter's Interview with Harley Simpson from Foxify on Regulations, CBDC Innovations, and Their Unique Platform\n\n\"When it comes to long-term potential, we're already seeing some of it play out with major players like Fidelity and BlackRock getting involved in the space, even if not directly with Bitcoin. While we're currently experiencing a challenging regulatory environment in the US, I believe that once the regulations are in place, larger institutions will enter the market. This will lead to mass adoption and decreased volatility over time, ultimately highlighting Bitcoin's great potential.\n\nAs for the impact of regulation on the blockchain industry, it's true that regulations could slow down the development of smaller projects, as the barrier to entry may become more difficult to navigate. However, in the long term, tighter regulations could lead to a decrease in scams and fraudulent activities, ultimately benefiting the industry.\n\nWhen considering the impact of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) on the crypto market, it really depends on how they are used. If CBDCs can be easily integrated with existing crypto wallets and platforms, they could help people become more comfortable with digital currencies. However, it may take some time for this growth to materialize.\n\nFocusing on the use case of Foxify, our company has developed a unique peer-to-peer trading platform. Instead of relying on a centralized market maker, users can create their own trades and find counterparts directly on the platform. This approach empowers retail traders and fosters a fair and transparent trading environment.\n\nOur platform is decentralized, with funds held in a smart contract rather than by the company. This ensures that transactions are secure, and it operates in a manner similar to other decentralized applications. As for the security of transactions on our platform, it is as secure as a typical Web3 wallet, provided there are no malicious elements in the smart contract. The technical details may be complex, but users can have confidence in the security of their trades on our platform. \"\n\n\"The Only Guarantee in Crypto Is Risk\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShare this article:"

It is not a recommendation to trade.\n\nSince its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has dominated the crypto market. It has grown to become a mainstream asset class that attracts a wide variety of investors and turns over billions of dollars in daily trading volume.\n\nHowever, over the past few years, many other digital assets, known as altcoins, have emerged and gained significant popularity, eating away at Bitcoin's share of the total crypto marketcap \u2013 otherwise known as Bitcoin dominance.\n\nThis was witnessed at the highest degree during the 2021-2022 bull run when many coins and tokens rallied upwards of 1,000%. While BTC made new highs during this time, its returns were far less, causing a drastic drop in its dominance percentage.\n\nThe question on many people's minds is when will altcoins once again have their moment in the sun?\n\nThis article will explore the concept of Bitcoin dominance, its role in market cycles and the factors that could help indicate the dawn of a new altcoin season.\n\nIdentifying market cycles\n\nWhile markets are viewed by many as moving up or down - bullish or bearish - they often move in distinct long-term phases, known as cycles.\n\nMarket cycles are characterised by 4 phases \u2013 accumulation, markup, distribution and markdown.\n\nWhile there's no fixed or definitive timeline, the patterns typically remain the same. Identifying these patterns can help you enter during an accumulation or markup phase and amplify your long-term profit potential.\n\nAlthough price cycles are a result of money flowing in and out of the market, these fluctuations are primarily driven by market psychology \u2013 fear, greed and cognitive biases.\n\nMarket psychology plays an important role in identifying entries and exits and is explained in depth in the Binance Academy article - The Psychology of Market Cycles.\n\nBitcoin dominance on the rise\n\nBitcoin dominance is a key metric used by investors to help determine where we are in the market cycle and plan entries and exits accordingly.\n\nThis percentage value is calculated as follows:\n\nBTC marketcap / Total crypto marketcap * 100\n\nAt the time of writing, the combined marketcap of all cryptocurrencies is US $1.15 trillion, while Bitcoin's marketcap is US $530.5 billion.\n\nThis means that Bitcoin's dominance is currently sitting at 47.28%.\n\nBy monitoring Bitcoin's dominance percentage, investors can gain insight into market trends and identify potential opportunities.\n\nIn the past, traders have used this metric to help identify when money is flowing out of Bitcoin and into lower marketcap trading pairs. Recognising this change allowed these savvy investors to diversify their portfolios at the right time and gain early entry to altcoin season and the high returns that followed.\n\nBinance Guide: What Is Binance BTCDOM Index\n\nAltcoin season: How to plan your investments\n\nIn the past, altcoin season has come in various trends, including DeFi summer, the NFT boom and the Metaverse hype.\n\nWhile the coins and tokens may differ each cycle, altcoins season is typically characterised by a significant drop in Bitcoin's dominance percentage and the rallying of lower marketcap trading pairs.\n\nWe spoke to Liam O'Doherty from Binance Australia to get his thoughts on where we are in the current market cycle and what Bitcoin's current dominance of 47.28% might mean moving into the second quarter of 2023.\n\n\"When markets rally, major traders will look for better returns than Bitcoin (BTC). During these periods, they'll often trade between BTC and altcoins (instead of fiat or stablecoins) to take advantage of the overall market movement. When BTC rallies, a rally in altcoins often follows as traders use new profits to seek further gains in alts.\"\n\nWhile it's impossible to predict the exact timing of the next altcoin season, Liam raises a good point. After a shaky 2022, Bitcoin has shown strength in the early stages of 2023.\n\nThe 'king of crypto' has gained about 10% in the past 2 months, leading to a rise in its dominance percentage, with many traders turning to Binance to utilise the platform's zero spot trading fees across 13 Bitcoin spot pairs.\n\nAlthough BTC has a long way to go before reaching its previous all-time highs, investors who purchased at 2022 lows may look to take profits and diversify into lower marketcap altcoins.\n\nThis diversification was witnessed during the 2021 bull run when altcoins such as BNB (the native coin of Binance exchange and BNB Chain) saw exponential growth. Over the course of about 6 months, BNB gained 2,442% while BTC rose 284%.\n\nIt's important to remember that past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nDuring the 2021 altcoin season, Bitcoin's dominance percentage dropped below 40% as profits were taken and investors diversified their portfolios into high-performing alternatives.\n\nPiecing the puzzle together\n\nWhile understanding market cycles and tracking Bitcoin dominance can help you identify when an altcoin season is approaching, it's also important to watch the development progress and roadmap of some of your favourite projects.\n\nLiam from Binance agreed that the crypto space can be overwhelming and full of speculation. It's probably best to stay away from speculative and high-risk investments and focus on the fundamentals.\n\n\"To see a true alt season, you want to see a surge in development of tech.\"\n\nProjects that are reaching their goals and helping to push the limits of blockchain technology are the ones that will most likely perform well over the long term.\n\nThere's no set formula for predicting or trading the market \u2013 it's crucial to do your own research (DYOR) and consider your risk appetite before investing. Always follow a trading or investment plan and conduct due diligence in research through reputable sources such as Binance Academy.\n\nMarketcap vs price: thinking about when to buy One of the most important metrics to consider when planning your crypto investments is market capitalisation or simply marketcap. Marketcap refers to the total valuation of a cryptocurrency project. This value can be calculated by multiplying the price of an asset by its circulating supply of tokens or coins. For example, a project with 1 million tokens worth $10 each has the same marketcap as a project with 10 million tokens worth $1 each. Not understanding this can lead beginner investors to purchase cryptos based on their token price or because it's 'cheap' compared to the price of one Bitcoin. Some low-priced cryptos, such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), are highly valued, with multi-billion dollar marketcaps. However, expecting these to reach a price of $10 per token is extremely unlikely and would lead to a total marketcap in the trillions \u2013 much higher than Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer: This information should not be interpreted as an endorsement of cryptocurrency or any specific provider, service or offering.

We gave higher marks to licensed casinos that offer a wide selection of games from top-tier software developers like NetEnt, Evolution Gaming, Yggdrasil, and others. We want classic casino games like slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker, plus provably fair games and live dealer games.\n\nBitcoin Casino Bonuses and Promotions:\n\nWe evaluated what type of deposit bonuses and no-deposit promotions the best online casinos offer, including free spins. We factor in the size, terms and conditions, wagering requirements, bonus games that apply, time limits, and more to determine which ones give players the best value for their money.\n\nPayment Methods and Payout Times:\n\nWe also considered how fast the casino pays out winnings and how many payment methods are available for deposits and withdrawals. We gave higher marks to casinos that accept multiple cryptocurrencies, including altcoins like Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum. If fiat currencies are supported, that\u2019s fine, but not too relevant for cryptocurrency casinos.\n\nMobile Optimization and Customer Support:\n\nAt a minimum, we expect a Bitcoin casino to have a website optimized for mobile devices and customer service staff available 24/7.

        "title": "Bitcoin halving one year away; When will BTC price spike? - Finbold - Finance in Bold",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been recovering in the past few weeks against the backdrop of the widespread crisis in the banking sector, and its recovery has been led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is looking forward to a halving in a little over a year and a potential price hike that could be connected to it.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin is estimated to go through another halving in the first half of 2024, specifically sometime in late April or early May, when BTC is set to reach 840,000 blocks, at which time the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks, which currently amounts to 6.25 BTC for each block mined, will be cut in half.\n\nThis process was introduced to control the supply of the maiden decentralized finance (DeFi) asset, as there can only ever be 21 million BTC in circulation, making it deflationary, as opposed to inflationary currencies like fiat money that can be printed in the amount and period decided by governments.\n\nBitcoin halving cycle patterns\n\nAs it happens, the previous halving events, the last of which occurred in May 2020, take place roughly every four years and have typically been followed by an increase in the price of Bitcoin, leading many crypto traders and analysts to expect no less from the future Bitcoin halving.\n\nWith this in mind, the pseudonymous crypto analyst therationalroot has compared the past Bitcoin halving cycles and the price of the flagship cryptocurrency on a chart with a focus on its all-time highs (ATHs). Upon comparison, some interesting similarities arise, such as the timing of the top formation after a similar number of days.\n\nBitcoin halving cycles. Source: therationalroot\n\nMore recently, the analyst also shared a chart that demonstrates the progress of the current Bitcoin halving cycle and BTC price compared to the historical trends, indicating that Bitcoin is now 72% into the current halving cycle as of March 20.\n\nThe chart is also useful in observing the timeline of the previous BTC price spikes, suggesting the next one could occur about a year after the fourth halving cycle date, taking into account that Bitcoin had the habit of spiking roughly 10-12 months after each of the halving events.\n\nBitcoin halving cycle progress. Source: therationalroot\n\nBitcoin price change\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin was at press time changing hands at the price of $27,757, which demonstrates a slight decrease of 2.05% over the last 24 hours but still a 14.12% gain across the previous seven days and 12.4% on its monthly chart, as per the latest CoinMarketCap data retrieved by Finbold on March 21.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nTaking into account its chart patterns surrounding the past halving events, it is safe to assume that the fourth Bitcoin halving in May 2024 will involve a significant price increase for the crypto industry representative and its largest asset by market capitalization.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hang around the $28,000 psychological threshold, demonstrating strength amid the financial crisis that has toppled some of the major banks in the world, its worth to investors becomes more evident, even for those that only decided to join after its all-time high (ATH).\n\nIndeed, people who started dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin at its ATH price of $69,000 on November 10, 2021, are currently recording 10% returns on their regular investment, despite the price of Bitcoin currently being 60% lower than the ATH, according to the data and charts shared by Bitcoin Magazine on March 20.\n\nBitcoin DCA since November 10, 2021. Source: Bitcoin Magazine\n\nPatience pays off\n\nDespite things not looking so well in July 2022, when these investors were at a loss of 51.91%, or in November and December 2022, when they were still down about 40%, the situation has significantly improved since then for those who have stuck with their strategy and steadily purchased the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) asset by market capitalization.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin dollar-cost averaging refers to investing a fixed amount of USD into BTC at regular time intervals. Purchasing $10 worth of Bitcoin every week would be a typical example of DCAing. This strategy is mostly used by investors seeking to buy Bitcoin for the long term since it reduces the risk of allocating all capital at price peaks and the impact of volatility, removing mental barriers of other investment strategies.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nMeanwhile, the price of Bitcoin at press time stood at $27,945, which demonstrates a 0.27% drop in the last 24 hours, as the flagship cryptocurrency still retains the gains of 7.69% accumulated across the previous week and 12.85% over the past month, according to the CoinMarketCap data retrieved by Finbold on March 21.\n\nBitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin has added $219.86 billion to its market cap in 2023 against the backdrop of the wide-reaching crisis in the banking sector that has claimed several casualties and led to the five leading banks in the United States to lose an aggregated market capitalization of $108.92 billion during the same period, while the crypto Fear & Greed Index is at the highest level in the last 16 months.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "The recent upturn in the cryptocurrency market, led by the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset Bitcoin (BTC), has given wings to Bitcoin mining companies\u2019 stocks, as their price in terms of weekly performance is recording substantial gains.\n\nSpecifically, the surge in the BTC price has resulted in most Bitcoin mining companies posting stock price increases, according to the recent information shared by the cryptocurrency market data aggregation and analytics platform CryptoRank on March 20.\n\nBitcoin mining stocks advance\n\nAs the chart indicates, the Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) stock has climbed 75.8% over the past week, followed by Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) with a 53.3% increase, Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT) at 52.8%, Hut 8 Mining (TSE: HUT), which has gained 49.2%.\n\nFurthermore, other blockchain stocks involved in Bitcoin mining that have recorded significant weekly gains include Digithost Technology (CVE: DGHI) at 43%, HIVE Blockchain (CVE: HIVE) at 29.8%, Bit Digital (NASDAQ: BTBT) at 27%, Core Scientific (OTCMKTS: CORZQ) at 26.3%, Argo Blockchain (LON: ARB) at 24.4%, and Bitfarms (TSE: BITF) at 23.9%.\n\nBitcoin and mining stocks weekly performance.

Source: CoinMarketCap\n\nAs it happens, the latest bullish rally in the crypto industry arrives as the banking sector is struggling with multiple large-scale collapses amid a crisis threatening to engulf more financial institutions, which has led some Bitcoin advocates to suggest buying more of the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization.\n\nAt the same time, a long-term Bitcoin critic and CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, Peter Schiff, has predicted that the world would eventually shift from fiat to digital currencies due to the dollar\u2019s rapid devaluation, but he does not believe BTC will be one of them, as Finbold reported earlier.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

        "content": "Amid a widespread financial crisis that has seen multiple banking giants collapse and more at risk, Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund manager, believes that this situation could further strengthen the power of Bitcoin (BTC) as well as the cryptocurrency market as a whole.\n\nDue to this declining trust in banks and people fleeing into alternative systems, becoming aware of their benefits amid crises, Pal believes that the crypto industry and Bitcoin could explode in the future, closely resembling the chart patterns from 2013, as he explained in an interview with Anthony Pompliano published on March 20.\n\n\u201cI think there is a potential setup here for Bitcoin and the whole crypto market actually, to be shockingly strong, more like in 2013 than 2019 [when] we had that big correction (\u2026) partially due to the G5 central banks\u2019 balance sheets that were contracting over that period of time, and it pulled back the crypto market.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Pal, who retired from his position at the age of 36, said that he got into Bitcoin in 2013 because he realized there was no trust in the banking system after the financial ruin of the investment banking company Lehman Brothers.\n\n\u201cWhen you realize that, in a bank, you don\u2019t actually own your money, and people are now realizing that, and the Treasury and the FED are like \u2018well, we\u2019ll just pretend that\u2019s okay,\u2019 that drives people into this parallel financial system. I got into Bitcoin in 2013 for exactly this reason and have been an active participant in the market ever since.\u201d\n\nCrypto and Bitcoin explosion\n\nThe former hedge fund boss did admit that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility was what made people skeptical about its ability to act as a wealth preservation asset \u201cbecause, in people\u2019s minds, the time horizon is too short.\u201d However, \u201cif you hold it long enough, it does extremely well, it does better than the FED balance sheet, better than any other asset in existence.\u201d\n\nPal also expects there would be \u201ca gigantic pushback from the government as more people move out of the system and into the Bitcoin market,\u201d but if the United States fails to understand that people have \u201cawoken to the fact that there is another way out of this,\u201d many crypto companies could move to the United Kingdom.\n\nWatch the entire video below:\n\nFeatured image via Real Vision Finance YouTube."

        "content": "As Credit Suisse (SWX: CSGN) becomes another banking giant to feel the effects of the widespread crisis that has already crashed several financial institutions and put many others at risk, it is worth reminding of the words of its former CEO, who claimed Bitcoin (BTC) was a bubble.\n\nIndeed, the former Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam was skeptical about Bitcoin, arguing that the flagship decentralized finance (DeFi) asset was \u201cthe very definition of a bubble,\u201d the anonymity of which presented a challenge, as he stated at a press conference back in November 2017.\n\n\u201cFrom what we can identify, the only reason today to buy or sell Bitcoin is to make money, which is the very definition of speculation and the very definition of a bubble.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he claimed that the use of Bitcoin in criminal activities was another challenge for the cryptocurrency and that banks were disinterested in getting involved with \u201ca currency which has such anti-money laundering challenges.\u201d However, banks jumping on the crypto train later proved Thiam wrong.\n\nCredit Suisse struggles\n\nIronically, not only did the interest in Bitcoin increase since Thiam said those words, but now his former employer, Credit Suisse, is struggling, and it had to be rescued by Switzerland\u2019s biggest bank, UBS. Early optimism about the deal soon deflated, and both CS and UBS shares plummeted.\n\nSeveral days before, Credit Suisse stock saw a substantial increase upon the announcement that the bank had intended to borrow over $54 billion from the Swiss central bank, as Finbold reported on March 16. However, things have taken a turn for the worse since then.\n\nIt is worth noting that, shortly before the UBS acquisition of Credit Suisse, renowned economist Nouriel Roubini warned that the bank might be too big to fail but also too big to be saved, while Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the best-selling personal finance book \u201cRich Dad Poor Dad,\u201d had (correctly) predicted that more banks could come crashing down."

        "content": "Bitcoin price could potentially be following a fractal from gold during the 1970s \u2013 the last time inflation in the United States got out of control.\n\nWhat followed was a more than 700% rally in the precious metal. Will the same happen in digital gold?\n\nBitcoin Follows Price Fractal From 1970s Gold\n\nOver the last week, both Bitcoin and gold have rallied in the wake of widespread bank runs and failures. Gold is up roughly 10% on the year, while BTC is near a 70% return.\n\nWith bank shares plummeting and the top cryptocurrency by market cap rising, BTC priced in banks makes for some of the most shocking and awe-inspiring price charts you could imagine.\n\nThat shock and awe might continue, if a fractal BTC is following from 1970s gold continues to unfold. In the 1970s, the United States inflation rate reached over 10% and double-digits wasn\u2019t uncommon through the early 80s.\n\nDuring the worst of it, gold went on to climb more than 750% from $100 to $850 per troy ounce of the precious metal. Now that same price fractal is potentially back in Bitcoin, and so is soaring inflation.\n\nBitcoin today versus 1970s gold | BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n\nThe Fastest Horse In The Race Against Inflation\n\nDuring the 2020 bull run, billionaire investor and philanthropist Paul Tudor Jones famously said that Bitcoin could be the fastest horse in the race against inflation, referencing 1970s gold.\n\nInflation had first reached double-digits in 1974, only three years after US President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would no longer be convertible from dollars to gold at a fixed price of $35 per ounce.\n\nGold went parabolic, first experiencing a pullback in 1974 when inflation got overheated. After a two-year long correction, gold spent the next several years rallying by more than 750%.\n\nBitcoin price also corrected hard when inflation first reared its head, but after two years is starting to show resilience. In the future, it could prove to be the digital equivalent to gold in the 1970s, helping investors beat inflation or a banking crisis.\n\nIn the price fractal above, gold completed a wave 5 after an expanded flat correction, according to Elliott Wave Principle. In commodities markets, wave 5s tend to be extended. With BTC being classified by the SEC and CFTC as a commodity, could the crypto asset perform similarly?\n\nIf BTCUSD were to follow the same path with a 750% return from recent lows, it would ultimately take Bitcoin to over $132,000 per coin. Could this be what\u2019s ahead for the first-ever cryptocurrency?\n\nIn Elliott Wave Principle, commodity wave 5s are the longest and strongest. With #Bitcoin labeled a commodity by the SEC and CFTC, will it exhibit such commodity-like market behavior? Here is a comparison with #Gold in the 1970s. $BTC vs $XAU pic.twitter.com/I6ifTOtz8V \u2014 Tony \"The Bull\" (@tonythebullBTC) March 20, 2023"
